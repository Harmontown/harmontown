00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Some gorgeous uptown Burbank Harvintown once again is in session.

00:12.000 --> 00:29.000
Please welcome the Game Master Spencer Crittenden and the Mayor of the Mostists.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Dan Harmon!

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
Hello, hello, thank you!

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
I mean, obviously it's like, you know, hello, how are you in the usual niceties?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I also should add, I'm not a Nazi.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Like, that's a new thing that you just add to be polite.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
That's the new minimum definition of interhuman communication.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
You want to start, I'm not a Nazi.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
You have to know that.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
But if you were, it would go a little something.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
And then you say, oh Dan, you're pandering, you're virtue signaling, right?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Isn't that what you call it? You fucks?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Oh, you say you're not a Nazi and then you get a big bell and a cookie,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
because that's so easy to say you're not a Nazi.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Well, no, it's not that easy to say, is it?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
It's not easy to say you're not a Nazi.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
The president has a difficult time.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
And he has no repercussions to fear, really, except for some Nazis not voting for him.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
And he has traded that today.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
He has officially decreed to the extent that a compulsively dishonest parasite can decree anything.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
He has decreed that he is a Nazi, because there are people goose-stepping down a main street

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
in the heart of America, wherever the fuck that place is.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
And it would have been so easy to trade a couple of Nazi votes

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
for what he might have hoped would be a couple of non-Nazi votes.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Perhaps the easiest votes to get of all.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Simple non-Nazi votes.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Low-hanging democratic fruit, it's been called.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I promise to not be a Nazi.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
You're hired these days.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
He couldn't do it.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
He couldn't bring himself to do it.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
And that is as close as you're going to get with a coward to his saying,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm a Nazi, which is what he said.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
He just wants to be loved by Nazis.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
And just wanting to be loved is important and human.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
We all just want to be loved.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
And the big question is, when you are not loved and a Nazi is across the street going,

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
Yoo-hoo, do you go back to being not loved or walk across the street?

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
That is what this civil war, and I promise you that's what's brewing,

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
is going to be all about.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
And it's fucking over.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
The discourse is over.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
We have sat.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
We have talked.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
We have argued.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
We have pondered.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
The discourse is over.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
These people that tweet you when you retweet somebody,

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
when you just say a simple fact that should not cause you to get a knot in your stomach,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
like, I'm not a Nazi.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
The people that tweet you and say, nor am I, but just out of curiosity.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Just tell them to go fuck themselves.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
The discourse is over.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
The war has begun.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
You're not talking to Nazis anymore.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
You're not talking to people that want to entertain the notion of being a Nazi anymore.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
You don't want to talk to people that want to circumscribe the concept of Nazism

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
within a fucking socratic dialectic about goddamn whether Nazi, Nazi, Nazi.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
They're fucking Nazis.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
It's the bedrock of humanity.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
It is so low that the worst people in the world find it.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
And that's where they rally.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And it's so low.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
We have gotten so bad that a third of our country has gotten there.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
29% of the people are fucking Nazis.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Let's face it.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
That's a minority.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
We can beat them.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
We have to say, I'm not a Nazi, though.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Two thirds of the country just don't want to be political.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
It's not politics to say you're not a Nazi.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
It's like taking a shit.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
You just do it.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
Or you explode.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
You die if you don't shit.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
And you die if you don't say you're not a Nazi.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Fascism is a fucking cancer.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
It will eat your country unless your country kills it.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Here's what happens when you get cancer.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Nothing good.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Nothing.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
There is no way out of it.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I'm your country's doctor.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
You've got cancer.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
You have fascism.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
You are going to suffer.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
You are going to fight.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
You are going to feel pain.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
You are not getting out of this.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
We have fascism.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
It is happening.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
We're fucking dead, maybe.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Or maybe they're dead.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
That's about it.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
It's not a continuum.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
There's no gray area.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
It's not a fad.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
Fascism doesn't pop up and then recede when it finds out no one's into it.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
It doesn't respond to love.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
It doesn't respond to hate.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
It doesn't respond to ignoring it.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
It doesn't respond to timeouts.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
It doesn't respond to attention.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
It doesn't respond to lack of attention.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
You stab it.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
You cut it out.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
You bombard it with poison.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Or you die.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
And in any case, you will probably die.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Don't die talking to cancer.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Don't die hanging out with it.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Don't die arguing with it on Twitter.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
It's fucking fascism.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Enough.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Team up.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Stop bitching about Bernie Sanders.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
I don't care what flavor you want your democracy to be.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
It's democracy versus motherfucking fascism.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
You can be as Bernie as you want.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
You've got to do it later, man.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
You've got to do it fucking later.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
You've got to do it later.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
You've got to oppose fascism.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
All right, so.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
So I have fingernail questions.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Because I went on a week-long trip.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
That was a fucking hairpin turn, man.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I had to hack my fingernail clippers for one trip.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Do they grow from the root and they just push forward?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
That's where the white lines happen.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
And those happen so fast that we still haven't developed a pill.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
How do you join Antifa?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
What is that?

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
That's just like a slur for not being a Nazi.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Is that a term that's been invented by the opposition?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Yeah, more or less.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
I mean, it takes the fascist out of anti-fascism.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Right, it's like the optics couldn't be better on the term anti-fascist.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
You don't want to lose that part.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Right, that's why they lost it, is because otherwise they'd say anti-fascist,

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
which they're talking about themselves as a fascist.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
So the bad guys shortened it to Antifa because that sounds like a Middle Eastern thing.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
That's my perception. Who knows?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Well, I looked it up.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Spencer, where do you fall on fascism?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I love it.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
But only when it's under my banner.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Because I happen to be right.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Stop arguing with them.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
Every person, there's 20 dudes willing to take their khakis and their tiki torches out under the shit.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
They're not even the worst of the bad guys.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
It's the six to one outnumbering them that are just sitting there watching on their laptops,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
going like, they have a point.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
Fuck them, shame them, find them, make them say, I'm a Nazi.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Introduce yourself to all of your friends tomorrow.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Hello, I'm not a Nazi.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Make everyone say it or don't say it.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
It's come to that. I'm sorry.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
It's called quarantining.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
The president cannot say, I'm not a Nazi.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Let's make it the cool thing to do.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Let's see if he catches on.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Let's see if he's the last person to say it.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
The whole tiki torch thing.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
How many home depots are in Virginia?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Like, that's a lot of fucking tiki torches.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
And how in love are they with that culture, that island culture?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Yeah.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Or do they just hate mosquitoes that bad?

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
They're throwing the only luau where nobody got laid.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
You know, the whole protest is all in the pockets of big tiki torch.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Here's a fun joke.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
That was Church's joke from earlier.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I still heard joke.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Knock, knock.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Who's there?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Funny.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Funny who?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
A funny Nazi doesn't exist.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
There's no such thing.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Have you ever gotten a laugh from interacting with any of these people?

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
You have to lose your humor before you get to that point.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
They're not making music videos, these people.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
They're not talented dancers.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
There's no, you always see the people.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
I saw Hart Hansen, the poor, kind Canadian soul,

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
created bones, probably fed these people their fucking murder bones

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
for 20 years of fucking syndicated bones episodes.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
And he bothers to say, well, the president seems like a fart face.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
And then someone's going like, hey, I love your show,

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
but respecting the president should be a thing.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
What, what, what, what?

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Fuck you, man.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Fuck you.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Fuck you.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Fuck you.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
Fuck you, fuck you, like nobody that makes television respects any politician.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Nobody.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
Like go fucking watch all TV that's only made by fucking Nazis.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Linwood Boomer.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
You're going to be watching Linwood Boomer.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Linwood Boomer's veggie tales show that we don't know about

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
where the tomato is like killing Jews and like,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
and then the pickle says like, how do you do that?

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
And the tomato says practice.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
It's not going to be good. It's not going to land a joke.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I guarantee you that.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I can't land a fucking joke.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Why do you think they're so mad?

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
Do we have any Nazis here?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
It's a legitimate question now.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
It's just a fucking straight up legitimate.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
It's as easy as it is.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I'm a little disappointed, actually.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
I thought our crowd was big enough to have a couple Nazis.

10:41.000 --> 10:48.000
Is anybody kind of a Nazi?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
So here's the ways we could die.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
We could die by Nazi.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I know I'm going to die.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
My longest longevity will be like firing squad,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
because I'm on record now.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I've said I don't like Nazis.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
You guys are still in the clear.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
You could be like what they call the March Violets or whatever

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
in the Third Reich.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Like you can later say, oh no, I was just hanging out.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I was just waiting to make a decision.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Nazi, please.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Good for you.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Good for you.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
You're a survivor.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I respect you so much.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
That's why I love your notes on Rick and Morty.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
I love you.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
I love your opinions about women.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
I just think you're the cat's pajama as you fucking pukes.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
And I've only gotten this far by giving a fuck.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
Psych!

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Dan Harmon turned into Kramer.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
The Nazis turned Dan Harmon into Kramer.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Ironically, okay.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Anyway, sorry.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Sorry.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Look, I mean, look, I didn't know.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I don't script the show.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I just want to say, I'm feeling what you're feeling.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
I know you're upset.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Thank you for coming out to a warehouse in Burbank

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
when you're this upset.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
You should be scared to leave your house now.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Thank you.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
I don't mean to dump on you.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I'm just hoping to cathartify you a little bit.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I don't know.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
He also wants to make up a new word called cathartify.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
I don't know.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
You know, and I know there's no straight answer.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Like, for all of you, you're not all feeling the same way

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
and all sometimes.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Some of you are coming here to escape this stuff.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Then you're bummed out.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
I was like, oh, Dan's just as mad as I am.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I don't want this shit.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I don't want to listen to dad yell about what I'm yelling about.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Some of you are coming.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I was like, oh, God, what if I just talked about Minecraft

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
for two hours?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
You'd be like, why did Dan do that?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Is he a Nazi?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
You're like, like...

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
See, I feel like, like, I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
but you know, like, a classic distraction tactic is like

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
when you're under investigation by special counsel

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
and all this stuff.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Like, you start saying, oh, I want to bomb Korea

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
or Korea's going to bomb us and all this stuff.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Or, you know, like, all this shit.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And I think that Trump is distracting from the real issue

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
of the day, which is if you have a dragon,

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
why are you going to ride it into battle?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
If you're the fucking queen,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
because you've got to hear you say dracarys.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Because if you don't say dracarys into his ear,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
it might melt like, like, just thracky.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Well, I don't think they'll do it.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Well, I guess they might.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
You don't write it in there.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
You don't write it.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
You fucking...

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
You have to have remote control technology.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Isn't there a line in a couple, like, last season

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
where Peter Dinklage is, like, lacking?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
And he goes like, oh, yes, of course.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Everyone knows that dragons have a limited bond

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
with the people that save them

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
and that they recognize the...

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Like, he does, like, a little line of exposition

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
that kind of buffers it.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
It's like, I thought I remembered that,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
because I was like, oh, you vey.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
That was a lot of leather.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Right. If that doesn't go anywhere,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
and it didn't in that season, at least,

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
well, not really, at least.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I think it was just, like, a patch over the whole thing

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
where it's just like, you can take...

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
You know, the dragons could be in a basement

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
and be bummed out that they're chained up

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
and almost eat you, but then you can take a bad guy there.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
You can take your husband and the things,

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
but then you can fly him over

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
and they can hit the ships that you need.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
I don't know. Who cares?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It's a good enough show.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Have you guys seen King of Queens?

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Game of Thrones is good enough.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I was in the desert.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I've seen more episodes of King of Queens

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
than any fucking person

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
since the Geneva Convention should be required to watch.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
This show is fucking insane.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I started to love it,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
because it became a hero,

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
because it was doing television so wrong

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
and surviving.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
It became Frodo.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
It was like carrying the ring of entertainment

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
to a volcano and throwing it in.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And I was so wrong going like,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
well, fuck it then. I'll die.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I love it then.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
I guess I understand your third episode

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
in a row about your relationship with your neighbors.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
I was just like, it's insane that show.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
It's fucking nuts.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
It's like watching a lizard cook on a rock

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
in that it's fucking amazing for a while.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
But if anyone caught you,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
you'd be ashamed of yourself.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
What the fuck?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Steve Levy, everybody.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Bringing the alcohol.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Steve Levy.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
Alcohol bringer to the stars.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Okay, I'm sorry.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
I'm really sorry.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
Look, I saw your tweet

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
whenever I asked all that was.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I can't wait to watch Dan stammer,

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
and then he says, I hate Nazis,

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
and he takes a drink.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Look, don't deconstruct me.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
I deconstruct the world.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
And you're going to miss me when I'm gone.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
And I'm going to kill myself in my bathtub.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
See, I measure when I should do it

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
by the amount of laughs that gets.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Wait, you want, it's getting down to a quiet,

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
that e-meter, that needle's just calm as shit.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
I'm going to kill myself,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
and you guys are like, yeah, we know.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Get on with it.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
How are you going to kill yourself in the bathtub?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm going to put a big plastic bag

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
and duct tape it all around.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
We've been over this.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Because I'm going to write like a professional,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I'm going to write backwards from the ending

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
where someone has to clean my ass up.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
And I'm going to have a note when you come in my door,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
which you're going to come to,

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
because I called 911 and I was like,

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
they're going to see a note.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
It's going to explain everything.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
I'm killing myself. Goodbye.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
And then they're going to see a note.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
It says, body's upstairs.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
It's in the bathtub.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
It's a bit of a mess.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
So sorry.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Sorry.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I put plastic down.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
I hope it held everything in.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I did it in the bathtub.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Going up.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Dogs are locked in the bedroom.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
They're not well trained.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
They'll be barking.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
How are you going to do the job?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I'm going to blow my brains out.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
What are you, a fucking idiot?

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
You're going to blow your brains out in a bathtub.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah, okay, that's nice.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I'm going to write a poem and dive face down

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
into a river outside my cottage.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
What the fuck?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
What am I, Jane Austen?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
You can slip.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah, I'm going to blow my brains out

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
like a fucking bro.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I'm going to stick my dick in my own mouth

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
and get it hard and fucking cum bullets.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Ah, came a bullet.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Killed me.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Looks like this guy died from coming so hard

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
because he was so straight.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
You think when it gets down...

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Let's clean him up and bronze his letter.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Then we won't be able to read it.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
What good is a bronze letter?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
You're not the most organized guy

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
when you're not depressed enough to kill yourself.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
You think when it comes down to the time

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
when you actually want to die,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
you're going to be duct-taping plastic up

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
around your bathtub?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Like, you're going to be that organized?

17:40.000 --> 17:46.000
I'll probably handle that, yeah.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
I got a full staff.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
All right, all right.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I got to put an asterisk on that.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
25% of our audience is young.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
You're feeling feelings.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Come on, don't.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I'm joking about that.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
I'm 44.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
It's a conscious thing.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
If you feel so sad that you feel like

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
that's an escape from your pain,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
talk to somebody.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Okay, very funny, Dan.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Very funny.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
That's hilarious.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Well, you'll be sad when I kill myself

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
because no one respected my fucking asterisks

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
for depressed people.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
You know what?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I couldn't stand the fucking eye-rolling

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
when I would care about people.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
I couldn't stand it.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
It made me kill myself.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Good job, assholes.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
You should not quite vote for Trump,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
but sit there and wait to see what happens some more.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
Fucking biomass of pukes.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Fucking big pile of puke.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Dan, feed me so I can dissolve you in my acid.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
You fucking gross pile of fucking human pudding.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Fucking brainless throng.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Can't even tell when I'm joking and when I'm not.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
But right now, I'm joking.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
You can't tell, you fucking idiots.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Dan.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Dan.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Stupid ass fucking jerks.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Dan.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Can't tell fake hatred from love.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Fucking morons.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Dan, you got it right where you want it.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
You got it.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Believe me, I don't only do this when I have

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
very lovable guests that I know you guys are

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
okay, we'll side with.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
But yeah, wait, wait, wait, what was that?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
How do you join Antifa?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Okay, I got that.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Oh, it's just, we're regarding my dogs.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
So if the North Korea thing happens,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
if we know there's ICBMs headed in,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I was like, do I have to kill my dogs?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
That's a thing.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
They'll be fine.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And then I was like, so I was like,

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
do I have to get cyanide tablets

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
so I can feed my dogs and then I kill myself?

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
And then, I don't think you can get cyanide tablets.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Well, there's got to be something that kills dogs.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Wait, wait, a lot of things kill dogs.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Dog bullets, I don't know.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
You love your dogs so much that you want

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
to be the one to kill them, not the ICBM.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
You don't want to give them the chance to survive it.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
I feel like, I don't know, okay, yeah.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Well, we've all seen the road.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
I don't want to, I don't care who survives,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I don't want anyone having to,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I don't want it to be me and my two dogs.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
But then, Mike Waldron said,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
no, you should keep those guys alive

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
and maraud the land with them.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
And I was like, oh, I like that,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
maraud the land with Nigel and Harvey.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Also, if you're too ill and like,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
succumbing to radiation sickness to move,

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
your dogs will just eat you.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
And that's the final gift that you give your dogs.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
It's just like dog cancer from eating

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
radioactive human meat?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
I mean, they probably have it too.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
No, you can eat radioactive human meat.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Do you think when dogs, like when they,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
and by the way, you know, cats will eat you first.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
We've been over that, right?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And it's not because they're like, yeah.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
They love faces.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Yeah.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Do you think when an animal starts to eat you,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
do you think it knows it's you?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Do you think, I mean,

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Yeah.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
We smell like us.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Yeah.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And so they're like, well, I'm eating Frank.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Yeah.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
You're the person that has the can opener.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
You represent food.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
The moment you stop being able to operate the can opener,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
oh, I am the can opener now.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm going to open this guy's,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
I'm going to open this guy's eyeballs up.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
So that means that every night,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
well, you're asleep, your dog or cat

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
looks at you for a second,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
and somewhere in their tiny brain,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
it makes the calculation of like,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I'll wait till morning.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
Like, if it knows when you're dead that it's you,

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
then it knows when you're alive that you're food.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Your worship is just its life on the knife's edge.

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
You're never too far from getting your face devoured.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
All right.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Well, I just made a,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I don't know if you call it a TV show anymore.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
It's on YouTube with the Game Grumps.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
You guys know what the Game Grumps are?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Well, don't give them a complex if you don't,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
they just pretend you do.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
They're more influential than me.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
They're influencers.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
That silent thing.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I'm going to kill myself.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm naming you guys in the note.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
How about this, Dan?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
They won't do that silent thing

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
if you start doing that funny thing.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Oh, shit.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Oh, shit.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
This show up until now has been fucking gold,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
but it's,

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
you can't, you're not going to get to me with that one.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I'm not insecure tonight. I'm riding high.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
I feel good.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I feel eloquent in my drunken rage.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
I'm not a Nazi.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
It's the new minimum bar for nobility.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I feel like a fucking knight.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Please welcome the Game Grumps,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Aaron Hansen and Danny Avidan.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
Oh, yeah.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Hello.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Hi, Game Grumps.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Now, statistically speaking,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
one of you might be a Nazi.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Not a Nazi. Just want to...

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Oh, I said it second.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Now you're just copying me.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Also not a Nazi, I promise.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Thank you.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
You guys had me on your show, the Game Grumps.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Yes.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
And it was a lot of fun.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
It was.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
It really felt like we made fast best friends,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
at least on my side, like...

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
This is where we wanted to break the news to you, Dan.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
I'm like only your third favorite person.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
Your episode was very well-liked,

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
as far as we can tell.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Oh, really?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
I mean, certainly on our end.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Right.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
But in terms of the fans.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
How much do you guys look at, though?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I mean, you're in this gaming community.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I'm not going to throw the whole community into the bus,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
but let's face it, I mean, come on.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Nazis, right?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Just a large share of that.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
What's the deal with Nazis?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
I mean, come on.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
To the point where I can't put you in a corner

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
and make you say yes or no to that.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
It's a...

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
They're there.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
They exist there.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
They said they aren't Nazis.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
They said...

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Shhh.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Shhh.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
No, you're very right.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Because I've experienced the same thing,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
where it's like I could come on stage and just be like,

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
yeah, fuck Nazis, right?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
But like if I said that on Twitter,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
it's a whole thing, and then people start,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
and then it's like, oh, but you...

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I want to talk about this instead.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It's like, no, no, don't fucking skirt the issue, man.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
We're talking about hating Nazis right now.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
We're talking about game grumping.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
It is weird.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
There's a game that we used to play.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
This is probably not unique to us,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
but we would look at the YouTube comments

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
and see how it started,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
and then see what it ended up being,

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
like 45 comments later.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
And it would always start with stuff like,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
man, the cat in the head is a dumb game,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
fucking Jews.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
YouTube comments are amazing.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
It's like, yeah, it's like fun to play that game

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
of like, well, this is a knitting tutorial.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
This can't get racist.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
And it's like 12 comments,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
and it's like typical Lib Tards,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
N-word, Lubbock.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Of course you do a crook stitch.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I mean, it's perfect, because the way

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
they format comments is like,

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
you see the first comment,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
and then it beds the other replies

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
to that comment underneath it,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
but it only shows the last comment

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
in that thread.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
So it'll just be like,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I like when Dan said this funny thing,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
and then it ends with fucking Jews,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
like literally, that's where it goes.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
It's a bad time.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Oh, good.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
I mean, it's especially a bad time to go after Jews,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
because even the Nazis

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
are into them now.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I know, I'm a Jew.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
It's not that kind of Naziism

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
right at the moment.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
My girlfriends feel safe,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
like Jared Kushner is the Israeli

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Prime Minister, I think, right now.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
It's, we're fine.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
In that department,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
it's not going to manifest itself in quite that way.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
It's a different, it's a new Nazi.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
It's not your mama's Nazi.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
No.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
It's the hot new Nazi on the streets.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
There's like frosted tips on the swastika,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
if you look real close.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Frosted tips?

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
But, no, but what I was going to say is,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I think, you know, and this is,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
you know, I get it, I get it,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
and I don't get it, I don't pretend to,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
the gamer community

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
has had its good times

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
and it's bad.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
The one thing that's kind of persisted is,

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
it's a passionate community.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
A lot of very cool people are passionate

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
about being gamers,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
and a lot of horrible people are passionate about it,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
et cetera, et cetera.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
But, do you guys

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
look at comments?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
You just implied that you do.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
No, not anymore.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
We did when we started, because it's,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
you know, you don't know what you're in for,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
and there's that kind of feeling of like,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
oh, cool, they're saying stuff about us,

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
and I can learn from it.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
You can't fucking learn anything from it.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Yeah, I always wonder about that,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
because I would obsess about it with community,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
and I felt safe.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I must have been incredibly popular

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
for two seasons of community,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
because, like, because I didn't,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I never really encountered so much

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
that it made me cry,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
and now I can't look at anything

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
without starting to cry.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Like, it could be rude.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Dude.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
But, maybe it's just like,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
but, but, but, but,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I got a, like, for a while, I was, like, insisting on it,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
and I would say, like, like,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
you know, like, the modern family

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
show runners would be like,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
oh, you sure are active on Twitter,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
and I got like, yeah, well, you sure

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
aren't handsome and successful,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
and, and, and, and then,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
and then it'd be like, you know,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
you should be careful with that feedback loop.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Don't you're concerned about the feedback loop?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
And I'd be like, feedback loop?

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
You mean, like, giving the power to the people?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Yo!

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
And then, but then, now, all these years later,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I talk to everyone, like,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I cannot stand you.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I hate all of you.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Everyone, everyone outside of my home.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I hate you.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Cool.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
That's sort of the paradox to it, right?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Like, people,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
fans at least, feel like

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
they need to be listened to and engaged with,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
and that makes you a better creator,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
but at the same time, they like you for the stuff

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
that's coming out of your brain,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
and not necessarily what they're asking for, right?

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
You can't win either way,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
so you just have to pick one and then stick with it.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
And I pick the one that keeps me out of therapy.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Which is, which is just doing

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
what comes out of your head,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
and if that entails cutting,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
cutting the feedback loose.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah, because it's, it's narcissistic

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
one way or another to keep, like,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
looking at what people are saying about you,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
like, regardless of the context, right?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Like, if you're Googling yourself,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
if you're getting good or bad, it's still like,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
this is all about me right now.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
You need to detach from that.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
And the thing about positive feedback is,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
it may be less effective

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
per capita than negative feedback.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
We all know that negative shit.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
We've talked about this in the podcast.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
If I say, oh, you're going to wear that shirt,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
like, you're going to remember that out of the nine things I say.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I didn't even say anything negative,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
but I just, like, implied something that's like,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Did you just neg my Care Bears metal shirt?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
You're going to, you're going to remember that

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
the next time you're going to dress,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
it doesn't matter if you think that I'm a fashionista,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
it'll just be like, it'll stick in your head

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
more than if I told you you were handsome,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
that you look like you've been jogging today.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I don't know what people say when they're being nice.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
That sounds like an insult.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
If you really want to fuck somebody up,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
just go, hey, what's up, ankles?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
What?

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Why are my ankles?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
What's wrong with my ankles?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Positive feedback doesn't stick as much as negative feedback,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
because positive feedback

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
tends to blend together,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and liking things is a harmonic thing.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I'm not just saying that because I'm Harmon.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I have a different view of that.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I think the reason that negative stuff sticks

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
is because most people have a negative self-image of themselves,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
and when they hear things,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
it validates what they already think about themselves,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
and if you hear something positive,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
it's usually something like, well, I don't really believe that,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
and you sort of move on, you know?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
And then you see the person that's like, well, you're not funny,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
and then you're like, I'm not funny.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
But somebody else sees it too.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
And then it sticks in your brain.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
People want to self-improve.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
We come out here to La La Land

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
to fix whatever happened on the playground.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
That bully said I was a fat nerd,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
so I'm going to go to LA,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
and I'm going to make my fat nerdness

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
powerful, and then a bunch of fat nerds

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
say, you're powerful,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
and then one fat nerd goes,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
be nice if you was fatter and nerdier.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
And you're like, that guy, that guy!

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
You know, everyone else, you're kind of like,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
excuse me, excuse me, you know,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
and that's what people are always complaining about.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
It always bums me out that people are like,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I know you don't respond to positive stuff.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I know, like, oh, God,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I wish I could remember where I heard this,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
probably a radio lab.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I'm about to do a dumb radio lab regurgitation,

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
but I think one theory

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
is that the idea is

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
we hold on to negative stuff

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
more than positive stuff as a survival mechanism

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
from back in the day,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
when you're out, you're a caveman,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
and of all the stuff you learn in a day,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
you have to remember that that mushroom is poison.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
That will kill you.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Yeah, totally, so that kind of

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
might be why it sticks with us.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
I like that. Well, that puts a positive spin

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
on why negativity drives us.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
And then it doesn't involve us having

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
to listen to negative people,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
because they're not mushrooms, they can't kill us,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
they're pieces of shit.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
And it's also okay to not look at feedback,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
because let's be honest,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
you scroll so fucking fast

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
at the minute.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
This is what I hate admitting,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
because I hate it when people go,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
ugh, you don't like people when they support you,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
so I think I'll tell you to go fuck yourself.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
And I say, double fuck you for implying that,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
but they're right, that person is right,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
because I need to improve myself there.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
You scroll through shit,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
and your brain gets so good at recognizing

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
a solid, eloquent paragraph

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
that's supporting you

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
to just fucking,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
whoop, you're just like scrolling

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
the better the episode of Rick and Morty,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
the faster you scroll, and you can stop it.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I was like, we're these fucking female writers,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
fucking shit up.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
It's the worst episode ever, and you're like,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
fuck you, I'm gonna talk to you for three days.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Yeah.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
And it's a weird scanning

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
for hatred and alarm,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
and yeah.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Have you ever heard of Herp Derp?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Herp Derp. For anyone who doesn't know,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
it's a Chrome extension

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
called Google Chrome, and

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
it changes all of YouTube comments

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
to some form of Herp Derp, Herpy Derp.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
It just goes,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
but if you're curious,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
you can still see if something has

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
like 700 thumbs up, or something like that,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
and then you can click on it,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
and then you'll see the actual,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
it'll turn into the actual comment.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
So what we used to do,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I can't take credit for this, this was our buddy Ross.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
He came up with Emotional Mind Sweeper,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
which is the game where you click on

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
it, and then you click on it.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Yeah.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
That's the bomb.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
That's awesome.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
We should do something like that on this show.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
But then these assholes

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
will go like, I want to be the mind sweeper.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
You're not really assholes.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Thank you for coming.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
You're the good ones.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Whatever you want to hear,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
whatever motivates you, chipmunks.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Jesus Christ.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
That's what they respond to.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Yeah. Happy to be here.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Happy to be here. Thank you.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Oh, I should introduce you guys.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
You guys do this thing on YouTube, right?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
No.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah, I mean, you guys have,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
how many YouTube followers do you have in your channel?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
We just hit four million.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Four million.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I went to do your Game Grumps thing,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
so we did this show.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
It's premiering in the 30th.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
It's called Good Game,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
and it's an attempt

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
to do the

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
eSports sitcom.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Fuck it.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
That audience

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
isn't picky.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Sick endorsement, bro.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Actually, I sort of want to

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
put this onto you. I'm actually curious,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
because I never really heard you talk about it.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
What was your interest in it?

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Because you sort of championed it.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I was interested in it because Michelle Maro,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
who pitched it,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
she had worked as a caster forever,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
and I was like, eSports,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
nothing, nothing, I don't know, nothing.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Our first eight conversations,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
every time I tried to say,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I kept saying League of Nations instead of League of Legends.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Which is like extra funny,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
because that's even,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
even if, like,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Hoover had been in the room,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
he'd be like, oh, dad!

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
League of Nations?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
What are you, Coolidge?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
It's

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
the Hoover Union now.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Anyways,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
the,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
what she had,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
she described the fact that, you know,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
eSports is like bigger than this

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
and bigger than that, all the statistics,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
and, but it was like,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
the idea that

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
it was the Wild West

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
because of that, that there was no,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
it's like, oh, that there's no,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
there's no established League,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
it's all just fucking deadwood, you know?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
It's like corporations all jockeying

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
for, so everyone wants to be the company

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
that kind of

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
figures out what eSports is.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Right.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
And I found that a fascinating backdrop.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
That's what caught my interest.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
That's awesome.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
And then I was like, let's just do community.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Well, we had a good time.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Yeah, it was awesome.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
No, you guys are fucking amazing.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I'm sorry if you think I'm like,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I love the show, everyone's going to watch it.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
It's on the 30th.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I know that gamer audiences are like,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
they're not going to be like,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
it's so heartwarming, I loved it.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Aaron and Dan,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
how does the show go? I've not seen it.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
What is the show exactly?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Well, so the plot of the show is that

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Dan and I are roommates.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
We're two 30-something losers.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Huge stretch.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
When I was like,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
when I was like 12 to 15,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I was really good at playing Dota,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
which is a popular competitive game.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
It's kind of the ancients.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Something like that.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Defense of the archives.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
So...

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Dinosaurs of the Atlanta.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I just quit placeholders.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Henry J.I. was writing something.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
So I was a prodigy

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and then I sort of gave it up

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
for one reason or another.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
And Dan's sort of my

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
scheming roommate, I guess.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
And you saw a thing on TV

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
that said eSports is this million-dollar industry

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
and knowing that I'm amazing at video games,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
he was like, let's start an eSports team.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
So that's where

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
we start off and then we recruit other gamers

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
and they're all like not your typical

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
eSports players

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
because they're usually like 18-year-old

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Koreans.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
And now it's

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
topical, maybe okay to say

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
you shouldn't be

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Korean?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
If you're out there

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
and you're Korean,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
don't.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
If you heard me faltering at the end

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
of that conclusion,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I was like, yeah, I don't think

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
this is going to come out

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
true.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I was just connecting linguistic dots

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
from the headlines.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Does anyone know where Guam is?

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I don't know where Guam is.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
It's way far.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
It's much closer to South Korea

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
than it is to Korea.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
It sounds like it,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
obviously it's not Guatemala.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
It sounds like it should be in South America,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
but I assumed it must not be, otherwise

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
they wouldn't be talking about it.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Great, good to know.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I can tell you this, Guam

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
is nowhere near Guatemala.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I thought it wouldn't be.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I expected it to be.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Except in the dictionary.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
What the fuck

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
are we talking about?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Just countries.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Is it just

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
alphabetical?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
We're talking about good game.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
There's game grumps and there's good game,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
and now we're talking about Guam.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Are we moving on to the next letter?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
What's up with Guacamole?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Is there an avocado?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
What is it?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Yeah, that's what Guacamole is.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I fell in love

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
with you guys just from the first click.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
We had,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I got some Rick and Morty writers,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Sarah and Erika,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
because they're more familiar with eSports

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
and competitive games.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
They came in and did a great fucking job

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
and I am proud of the show,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
but it's

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
a special note

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
how charismatic you guys are,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
because you're self-starters,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
you're just doing this thing.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
That's a common thing now,

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
like top 40 artists

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
are people who just did it

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
by themselves and all this shit,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
but it's always impressive to see

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
you guys,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
you didn't go to Juilliard,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
but you're amazing at being in front of the camera

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
and acting like yourselves,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
which is a huge challenge.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Well, I went to Juilliard for four years.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Yeah, no offense to everyone

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
who went to Juilliard.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
That's good too.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
But no, you guys are

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
super,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I can see why the huge following,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
because you're very genuine,

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
sincere, other synonyms for that.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Thanks, man.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
One of the funniest things

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
in the world that the girls played for me

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
was a clip of you

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
getting into it.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
What was the game where it was like,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
unbelievably,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
you couldn't get past a certain level,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
I know you say it happens all the time,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
but it was like Rocket Boy.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
If you're looking for highlights,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
that's probably something you could YouTube in,

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
listening to Aaron

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
get so fucking sincerely upset,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
way past the multiple thresholds

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
of like, okay, I should keep it together,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
because this isn't good optics,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
but then getting so fucking mad.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
That was definitely a form of therapy

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
playing that game,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
because I got more angry than I think

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I've ever gotten ever in my life ever,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
and it was just a dumb video game,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
so I think I broke something

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
in the office.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I think that's one thing that is true

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
of all things that are popular on YouTube,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
because it's such a weird,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
some people like this, and some people like this,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
and it's all so crazy and different,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
but the one common thread is that people like honesty,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
people like super honest reactions,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
whether someone's having a really awesome time,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
or a really shitty time,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
or they're very embarrassed,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
people are drawn to things

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
that are real,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
and I think TV is so much fakeness.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Just honest these days,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
you have to be so faken good, it's insane,

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
like the guy who does the

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
micro impressions,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
who I really want to have on the show,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
and I talked to him at Comic-Con,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
he does

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
the 50 impressions

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
in a minute thing, but his impressions

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
are half a second long each,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
because it's just like Kevin Spacey,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
if he forgot his straw.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Is that Ross?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
That guy's amazing.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
So that's an example of

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
he's not being himself,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
he's literally being other people,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
but it's like you have to be that on point,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
or for the rest of us, you gotta be yourself,

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
because there's a long line of

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
it's a small corner in a big market,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
whatever the economics are.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
But speaking of which,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I think you guys are like impressive businessmen,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
or is it just you,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Aaron, because you're

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Let me take this one.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
It's the hair.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
You guys have a history.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Danny can take it,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
he knows he's got the goods,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
but

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
it is fascinating to me that

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Aaron, you did the,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
this show starts with you

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
playing video games and loving it,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
and then there's a point where you...

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Loving it is...

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You're a little grumpy about it,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
but there's a point where you

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
hire Danny to

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
be the chong to your cheech, right?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
But you guys are so amazing together

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
that no one would ever think that

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
from seeing you two interact,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
but you actually kind of were like,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I'll take that guy.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Well, yeah, well, I originally started it

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
with another guy named John, and he...

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Fuck that guy.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
This guy gets it.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
But he left the show,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
and I was looking for another partner,

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
and we were writing an album at the time,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
called Starbomb,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
and the other...

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I appreciate it, that one album.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
You and the other guy were writing the album?

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
It was me and Dan.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Is that why the other guy left?

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
He's like, why don't you marry the guy

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
you're doing an album with?

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Well,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
it's a...

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Okay, that's a yes, and you can move on.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
So,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
writing the album with Dan,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
we were naming the song titles,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
and we were just

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
laughing in my living room for hours,

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
and so I thought,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
if ever

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
this other guy got sick or something,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I would get Dan to replace him for a couple episodes.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
And then, when he left,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I was like, well, fucking Dan, obviously.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
And then he did it, and it was amazing.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Right off the bat, it was perfect chemistry.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
There are certain friends that just make you

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
fucking giggle like an idiot,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
and it's always there,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
so that...

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
It's really how we are in our regular life

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
together anyway, so...

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I mean, there's some shit where we're in between

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
doing episodes that I wish were in episodes,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
because we're just constantly making each other laugh.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
And also,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
the off-camera jokes

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
can be a little more...

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
dicey?

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Which also, like, we wish we could,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
but it's like, no, it's not going to go...

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
We don't want to cause, like...

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I've been to your office,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
which I can't say where it is,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
because you guys are so popular that someone will show up

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
just to kill themselves in your bathtub.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Yeah.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
That's what they do.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
And I'm envious of that.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I'm always like, wow, that's good.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
You're just a little tyke.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Can I ask how old you are?

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Are you still young enough to...

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Me?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
What?

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
How old are both of you? Is it okay to ask?

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I'm 30.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I keep doing that to guests,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
and then it's like, what if they say no?

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Then that's weird.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
It would be weird if they said no.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
People would be like, they must be a mummy.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
So I shouldn't do that.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
No, I don't care. I'm 38.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Jesus Christ.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
It's bizarre to think about, too,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
because when I started doing Game Grumps,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I was 25, and 25 to 30

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
is a huge fucking jump.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
It sort of makes us worry a little bit

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
about how much longer we have,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
because our audience is usually

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
skews a little younger,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
so we're like, I don't know if people want to watch

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
50-year-old dudes playing video games

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
on YouTube.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I kind of can tell you think about that

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
just from walking into your office,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
because I get the sense that you

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
are business-minded from just

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
walking around your office space.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
You have people working for you.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I have an animation studio,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
and I'm not as organized as what I saw

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
when I went over there.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
I should arguably

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
feel less chaos.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I think that has a lot to do with...

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Our cleaning lady.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
But you guys have a little indie game

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
that you were doing?

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Yeah, we just really streamed Daddy

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
at that dating simulator.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Oh, you guys know about that?

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I mean, my friend went on in Odyssey

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
to find the Comic-Con booth,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
and we got to where it was after it closed

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
for a while.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
But that's not your fault at all.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I'm just trying to say that's how excited

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
we were for that.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Dick move on our part, man.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
It's Daddy Dream Date, is that what it's called?

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Yeah, Dream Daddy.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
A dad dating simulator.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
The acronym goes down as

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
D-D-A-D-D-S, which is dads.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
So we try to keep it...

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
You're the hot new dad that's just moved

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
into a neighborhood, and you're trying to seduce

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
other dads.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
What kind of...

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
But what do you have...

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Sorry if this gets embarrassing

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
or whatever, but I like the sincerity

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
and stuff.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
That is like a...

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
It does occur to me that that's a thought

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
that you might have, that you're like,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
oh, how long can we do this?

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Can we do this forever? I can't be 50

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
and play video games.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
So what you must then...

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
You have some exit strategy, what is it?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Nope.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Is it my hit show on YouTube Red?

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
You know it, Dan.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Yeah, I mean...

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Not to get too weird about it,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
but it is a little bit diversification,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
but when it comes to that,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
it's more...

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
We have people that are working at the office,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
and from very early on

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
when I started bringing more people on

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
to the group, my goal was to

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
get them to a place where they can

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
do their own projects.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
So use Game Grumps to catapult

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
other projects off of,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
because that's sort of like the backbone

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
everybody's watching it every day.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
NSP has huge visibility,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
his band, Ninja Sex Party,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
has huge visibility now because he's

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
in people's lives every day.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
So when he releases a music video,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
people...

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
We can promote it on the show,

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
people know who Dan is, so they're excited

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
about that. So that was sort of what

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Dream Daddy was.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I had the guy who spearheaded it at

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
the creating simulator,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
we fund it, and I was like...

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I was like, you're fired.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
No, my response was like,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
fuck yes, hell yeah.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
So he just started making it,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
and then eventually it became a thing,

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
and that's sort of what I hope

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
everyone can be in a position for,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
so they get to follow their dream projects

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
and then by helping them, I'm an investor.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
I mean, you think exactly like me,

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
and so I just want to say, don't depend

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
on their loyalty, they'll eat you.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
It's fine.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
I'm very happy, I'm just a workaholic,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
and I'm like, yeah.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
When I hear you guys talk about that stuff,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
it comforts me,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
and I have affection

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
for you guys.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Oh, Dan!

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I just want to...

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
I just want to die in as

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
least pain possible, you know?

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I thought you were going to say,

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
in our arms.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Didn't you just talk about,

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
that's how you wanted to blow your brains out

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
in a bathtub? Yeah, and then I talked about

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
how you guys have a bathtub.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Are you the kid?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Are your fans want to kill themselves in your bathtub?

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Remember, you're connected to these dots,

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
like, guess who's coming?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Guess who's coming to beta test

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Daddy Dream Date

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
after its alpha release?

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Wait, did you say Danny Dream Date?

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
It's Daddy Dream...

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
What the fuck, Roy?

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
What the hell?

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I was on a little monitor where we can watch you

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
on stage. We were just sitting there

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
looking at each other, and I was just thinking,

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
like, this is a hard act to follow.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Because, man,

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
it was heated!

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
No, I went all Lewis Black,

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
like, I was like...

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Is that how it usually is?

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
No, no, no, no.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
No, not usually.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
I think it was a rough day for everybody.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I mean, it was fucking heated down.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
It was like, there was a muscle knot

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
in America today,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
someone died, a lady died.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Who cares what the fucking gender was?

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Someone died,

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
at least one person, a bunch of people.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
And the most disheartening thing was,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
like, within seconds,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
memes going from one American

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
to another American,

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
like, with graphic imagery

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
of that horrific,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
horrible thing, an American

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
killing an American, and then an American

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
on their laptop,

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
fucking Impact Font bullshit on it,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
and sending it to another American,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
as if to say,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
human life means nothing to me,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
America means nothing to me.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
I think that's a fucking threshold, for sure.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
It's a fucking threshold, for sure.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
We've gotten beyond

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
glib, I'm 15,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
and I haven't evolved a conscience yet,

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
that, like, I think I'll throw you a black and white photo,

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
that's maybe unsightly,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
and puts fear into you,

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
because I think the young should eat the old.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Terrorizing 30-year-olds

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
with actual blood that just had been spilled

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
and probably wasn't cold yet.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
But I'm fine.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
I mean, we're in the bluest of blue states.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I'll be, like,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
you know,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
I just want, you know,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
I want to get killed

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
by a Nazi.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Like, I mean,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
even though...

50:50.000 --> 50:56.000
Let's bring him out!

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
That's your Nazi introduction music?

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Yeah.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
It's Randall the Nazi.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
He's from Chattanooga, Tennessee.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Put your hands together.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
If you wanted to die,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
wouldn't you choose

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
assassination by Nazi over colon cancer?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Are those my only choices?

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
And specifically,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
you have to die of colon cancer while everyone around you

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
is dying by Nazi.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I'm for sure.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
You're getting a glimpse of the better one,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
right in front of you,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
you're like, ah, I should've chose the Nazi.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Look at how much fun everyone's having.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Jesus.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I could've chose Nazi. Jesus Christ.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I think Nazis need to understand

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
is that they,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
like, it's not going to be like

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
you go to your 7-Eleven the next day

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
and it's an American 7-Eleven

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
and the slim gyms are cheaper.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
It's going to be torn down

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
and there's going to be a boot warehouse there.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Your country's going to suck

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
when it's taken over by a bunch of people

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
that suck so bad that they

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
couldn't even do anything with all their privilege.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Alright, anyways.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
If you think it's bad now

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
and you shouldn't...

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I think if you keep talking,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
you might get killed by a Nazi sooner than you think.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
It's taken less than what I've already said

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
in the past for people that have had less...

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Of course I'm going to get killed by a Nazi.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I don't think you have the guts

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
to actually dare a Nazi to kill you, Dan.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
I just did, and come on.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Yeah, Dan.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I dare a Nazi to kill you.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
You're going to forget about it,

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
at the end of the night and I'm going to get together

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
and you're going to be like,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
okay, I dare you to get a Nazi to kill you.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
You'll be like, shit.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
But I double dare America

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
to kill Nazism.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Oh, shit.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Hopefully that'll work faster.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Damn.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Come on.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Nice deflection.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Come on.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Jeff, you want to hang out in Nazi America

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
and just be like,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
I dodged a bullet.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I dare a Nazi to kill you.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Yeah, Jeff.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I dare a Nazi to kill me.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Right now.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Okay.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
You had your chance, Nazis.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Window closed.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Well, I...

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I was always certain it was going to be Adam Goldberg

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
or something.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
We don't...

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Because of your game grips,

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
maybe I was going to go into my Minecraft world,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
but we don't have time for that.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
You don't have time to do it.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
What are we going to do?

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
We're going to watch me punch down a tree.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
It's not going to...

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Wait, so what's...

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Hold on. I want to know.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Because you play Minecraft, you play Minecraft.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I play it.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
What's your proudest structure

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
on this show I played?

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I showed everybody my...

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Are you familiar

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
with a wither?

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
What a wither is?

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
What?

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
A wither farm? Do you know what a wither is?

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
God, I'm so out of the loop.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
This is when he unzips his pants.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
It's the oldest trick in the book.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Do not fall from this one.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
You signed the NDA.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I also sheared verbally

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
with these folks years ago.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I created a big cube in the sky

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
and the whole thing was run

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
on a zombie spawner.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
So these zombies would get spawned

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
and then they would get killed.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
And then all of their nutrients

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
and heads and bones and things

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
would go to different parts of the cube

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
and they would have harvested for their energy

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
and resources and things.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
You made the matrix.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
In Minecraft, you made the matrix.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
It was 9-11.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
It's 9-11.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
9-11.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Okay, well, so...

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
It's 9-11 in my heart.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
You want to hop on?

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Yeah, should I just put it on my lap?

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Well, maybe we should switch spots

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
so you could do it on this.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
It doesn't slide off.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Oh, shit. Jesus Christ.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
So Dan is now going over

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
to make podcast history

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
and play

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
and visual.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Oh, it's up there.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Oh, it's up there.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
You guys are probably fine.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Should we go into like...

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Like B-Boy stance?

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Yeah.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
For those of you just listening to the show,

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
you're better off.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
You want to...

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Now this is...

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I'll narrate. Dan just punched a square.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
He's punching...

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Well, that's the whole game.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Now it's raining squares.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
It's spruce wood, Jeff.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Spruce wood. Please.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Don't fucking take the high road up in here.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Boy, you got your own little guy, dude!

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Yeah, that's my skin. Did you make him?

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
No, no, someone Cherry Lacks

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
from the Internet made it for me. Thank you, them.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Oh.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I was going to praise how cool it is.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Oh, no, it's great, but it wasn't me.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Is Dan playing your game, Spencer? Is Dan playing his own?

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
It's mine. I got Dan's laptop,

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
but it was the wrong laptop.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
So we only have my laptop.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
And these keys aren't programs

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
the way I'm used to.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
R is the destroyer,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
but the rest should be the same.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
There's a big square fight.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I feel like you're going to be saying

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
lots about squares.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
It's kind of cube on cube violence going on here.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Wait, so what do you do?

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Tell us what's running through your head.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Walk us through your process.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
He's making sticks.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Why?

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Well, I made too many,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
and now I have shit.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Good point. You got to punch some more trees.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
This motherfucker made too many sticks.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
I want you to tell me.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
What was the best case scenario

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
of playing Minecraft on Harmontown

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
in your head?

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
This is it, baby.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I don't know. I had the Game Grumps on.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I thought I connected some dots.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Sometimes I do it badly.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Game Grumps, get Grumpy on this game.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Oh, yeah, you guys get Grumpy.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I've never played Minecraft.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
What the fuck I'm looking at?

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Look, there's a pig.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
That's a pig?

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Or a pint of strawberry ice cream.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
We can't tell what that fucking thing is.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
And a little-known trivia.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I'm sorry, okay.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Did you murder the pig?

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
You got stuff above you.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Little-known trivia,

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
the creeper is actually

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Notch's attempt at making a pig,

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
and it messed up in the code,

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
so he ended up making it a character in Minecraft.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Those iconic characters.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I chopped out some wood.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
You guys don't sound like the Game Grumps.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
You sound like the Game Delightful.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
I made the wood into wood planks,

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
and now I've made an axe out of wood,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
and that will let me chop down more wood faster.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Wait, so you got a wood and axe?

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Yeah.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
That's just a stick shaped like an axe.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
And the wood and axe has 64 durability,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
doesn't it?

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Oh, it breaks just like that, for sure.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
He's got a couple whacks.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Oh, shit.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
You're double fisting.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
What are you doing?

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Is that lightning? What is that behind your head?

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I think I have half of an angel ring wing on.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
At this point in the audience,

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
you're all free to go outside and smoke right now.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
This is a great time to take a bathroom break.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
All right, well, I'm going to kill myself in Minecraft.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
How's that sound? Oh, shit.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Oh, there you go. Find the bathtub.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
I'm going to find the highest ledge.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Do you have any plastic in duct tape?

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Craft a gun, dude. Craft a gun.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Yeah, it's going to take a long time.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
There's no clips. Is that a pig hanging in a tree?

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Oh, sure, it was.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
You can die in this game? Oh, yeah.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Well, you got those little hearts,

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
and once they deplete, then you're dead.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Like any video game.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Are you going to bury yourself alive?

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
What's going on? Why are you using the axe on the dirt, dude?

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Come on. Yeah, that weighs double the durability.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
You can just use your fists.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Come on. What's going on?

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Oh, boy. It's the same speed as your fists.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Oh, boy. It's the same speed as your fists.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
So you just pushed a bunch of dirt.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Yeah, now he's got ten whole dirt.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
You're not going to kill yourself.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Oh, you got to use the wood. Use the wood.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
You got to use the wood.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
So long, motherfucker!

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
You got to use the wood.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
I told you.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Oh, you didn't even fucking die.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
All right, okay.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
You just sprained a fucking ankle.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Okay, all right.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Fucking harvest more dirt and build a turret.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Just talk about your bands.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Just talk about your bands.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I know.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Well, I mine 20 blocks instead of 10.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Did he try to kill us?

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
He just tore an ACL.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Again, if you're listening

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
and you're feeling weird feelings,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
like talk to someone.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Oh, we should edit this out.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
How do you climb your tower

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
once you've made your tower?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Oh, once you've made it, he climbed it

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
by building it under his feet.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
He can't go to the top

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
unless he builds a staircase

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
to get to the tower.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
He's climbing the tower.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
There we go, there we go.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
You got five more.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
That's much higher, much higher.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Don't land on the trees now.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Take this, you fucking Nazis!

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Oh!

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Yeah!

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Let's hear it for the girls, everybody.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Yeah!

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Dan and Aaron, everybody.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Dan and Aaron for the game.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Thanks for coming out, fellas.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Four million followers.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Be four million one and two.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Thanks for coming out.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Sorry, Chris.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And good game, good game comes on YouTube Red

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
August 30th.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Man, this episode's great.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Yeah, this is...

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
You just fake killed yourself

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
by building a dirt tower.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I think it was a great way

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
for me to salvage a bad decision

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
to play Minecraft.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
I think it was a great decision.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I love Minecraft, you guys.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I'm gonna roll tonight.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I don't think I can do much wrong.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I think... You're in the zone, baby.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
What should we bring up Steve Levy?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Steve Levy, I'll always bring up Steve Levy.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Give us some Levy.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Diarrhea Junior!

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Diarrhea Junior to the stage.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Hello, Levy, how you doing, baby?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I'm doing well. How are you?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I'm doing well.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I can see that.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Oh, do you guys have blind guy questions?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
There's a fully blind guy

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I met in the lobby who's here at the show.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
His name is Dez.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Let's just bring him up real quick now that I mentioned him.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Dez, can you...

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Here's a segment called Blind Guy Questions!

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Alright.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
He's being played to the stage.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Alright.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Wow!

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Hello, Dan. I'm the guy that helps him.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Yeah. This is the guy that helps me.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Dan, question. Where the hell are you?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Oh, I'm over here. I'm over here.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Because he's blind.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
So I can pretend to look at you.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I'm not making fun of him.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
He's actually blind and he's drunk as fuck.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
He's drunk as fuck.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Take a seat right here, Dez.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Oh, thank you.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Dan, Dan Harmon.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Just a thing I wanted to say to you.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I don't have any questions.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I don't know anything about you.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Except that you created

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
my favorite fucking cartoon in the universe.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
So if anybody here loves Rick and Morty...

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Yeah!

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Nobody does, Dan.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Are you pantering?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Thank you, Dan.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
So what does Rick and Morty like without seeing it?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Dude.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Last week's episode

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
made no fucking sense to me.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I told him, like, watch.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And I say, like, oh, shit.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Listen to fucking Rick and Morty.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It's fucking great.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Do you watch TV with someone sometimes?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
And they describe it to you?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I do. Rick and Morty does not have audio description.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Which is fine. But a lot of other shows do.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Oh, right.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
You're not a fan of this podcast.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
We accidentally got tuned into

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
the audio description feature thing.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
And it was amazing.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Do they audio describe Rick and Morty?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
No, it was simply the

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
graphics, the movie

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
production companies.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It would just be a guy going,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
search lights, pan over the words

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
20th Century Fox as palm trees in the back.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
They're very specific, right?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Like, the lion puts his head through the loyal

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and roars.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Who the fuck knew that?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
He also

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
asked me, what is a pickle?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
And I showed him.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
What does a pickle look like?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Wait, so that's a question.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
You can't show him anything.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You're blind since birth?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Yeah, since I was born, yeah.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
So the question, what does a pickle look like, is an actual thing?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Exactly. I know what it tastes like.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And the answer is it tastes like shit.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Oh, thank you.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Pickle, hey!

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Thank you.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So, Roger looks like Curtis Armstrong.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
So, there you are.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
That's good, because I don't know what Curtis Armstrong looks like.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
So I would assume

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Roger is a sexy motherfucker.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I don't know.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Describing vinegar to him.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Yeah.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I want to conjure

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
kind of blind to people

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
questions, because I feel like we don't...

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
How brave are you

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
to buy condoms?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
How brave?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I'm just tired of getting socks dirty.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Like, people think it's brave.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I don't know.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Okay.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
My next three questions

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
aren't blind people questions. They're Des questions.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
That's true. That's very true.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Treat him like a human being for once.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Are you in a relationship?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I'm not currently single.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Ladies.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I don't know how to wink.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Orman.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Is there a

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
is there a blind community?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
There is.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
They all

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
don't know how to spell, because they can't read.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
But, there is a

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
blind community out there.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
But I can spell.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Is the blind community...

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Because obviously the jet we've...

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
We the...

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Whatever you call us.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
We call you Sidi. Down with Sidi.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Down with Sidi.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Down with Sidi.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
You can fucking see shit.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Fuck Sidi.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Des.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Des, you're coming back immediately.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Yes.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I have a...

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And it's not because you're blind.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I hope not.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I have a drunk blind guy question for you.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
You know, in the movies,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
the blind person touches somebody's face

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
to see...

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Do you ever abuse that and go too far?

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Like, just...

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
You kind of touch...

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
You kind of touch the titties

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
and if they're...

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
They're kind of not what you expect.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
You're like, oh my god, these titties!

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
These are pecs.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
At that point, you're like, well, let's work on this.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So, it's possible to be a bad person

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
and blind at the same time.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I'll tell you, brother, it's entirely possible.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
And it's happened on many occasions.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Yeah.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
The reason I ask, is there a blind community?

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
There's dating, too.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Tell me when I'm prying too much,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
but I want to know about your sex life

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
if you're blind since birth.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Ask me where a couple actually.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Dating's hard, man.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Before I found Reggie,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
the guy to my left,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I would be on a Tinder

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and I would go on dates, dude,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
just on Tinder, just based on one picture

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
that I uploaded.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
And the girl would be like,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
you never told me

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
in your profile

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
that you were Mexican.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And you were like, I would be like,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
neither did my parents.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And so...

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
It's just a big shock, man.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
So, there's one stereotype we're confirming,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
which is that when you lose one sight,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
your comedic timing gets

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
enhanced.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
It gets better.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Just like smell and taste,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
it gets a lot better, yeah.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
He's been practicing, guys.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I've been working on it.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
But you're so funny, we don't know what the truth is now.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
How does the dating work

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
if you're born blind?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
How do you meet people?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
If you're desperate enough

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
or pussy, it works.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
That's just what it is.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
She does, you had him and you lost him.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
You had him.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I mean, it's your guys' fault

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
for offering free beer.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Thank you, Dan.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Appreciate it, man.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I tip a dollar for each one.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Is that face-touching thing a thing?

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
It's not a thing,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
but you can make it a thing

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
when you're drunk enough.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
It's not a real thing,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
but if I really wanted to

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
communicate something...

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I find people

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
have a...

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
people who lost sight

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
later in life,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
is there a bump boundary between those...

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
How bump boundary?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
We can read that shit?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
It's Braille or what?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
You talked to him for five minutes

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
and you're like, dude, you could see for five years, couldn't you?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
No, I was like,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
well, I'm just wondering,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
because in the deaf community,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
there's like, oh, you got cochlear implants

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
or you lost your hearing

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
later after you were born

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
and then there's people who are born deaf and etc.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I'm just wondering if you guys...

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
You guys or your people?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Do the blind from birth

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
do they refer to

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
people who lost their sight

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
in childhood?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
People who lost their sight in middle age

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
in different ways?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I wish, dude, like if it was the Bloods in the Crips.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
You lost your sight later

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
in life, you fucking poser, right?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
You fucking fake?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I've actually tried to describe

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
like...

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I've tried to describe colors today

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
and it's impossible.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I would love for you to give a world

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
describing colors.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
My big question, Dan, is

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
you created my favorite cartoon of all time

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
and I have no idea

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
what the creator

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
of my favorite cartoon looks like.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Oh, me?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
So why don't you give me a description, Dan?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
What the fuck does he look like?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Touch his dick!

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Touch his dick!

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
What does he look like?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Touch his dick!

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Touch his dick!

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Touch his dick?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Touch...

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I think the challenge is more like give him a...

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
He's blind, he won't know.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
You can tell me whatever you want, dude.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I'll believe it.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I mean, do you...

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I look

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
like...

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I actually told him

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
you look alike.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Oh, well, but how does he know what he looks like?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Exactly!

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Dan, how about this?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Dan, I have a pitch.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Dan, what if we get...

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I'll pick two people out of the audience to come up here

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
and do a lineup and he has to pick

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
by touching

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
your faces to see which one

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
is the creator of your favorite cartoon.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Let's figure this thing out, man.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
It's good!

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Is that fulfilling for you, Des?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Or is that like...

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Isn't that kind of random?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It's very random, but I mean...

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Because I was trying to think of, you know,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
do you ever hear the movie Mask with Eric Stoltz?

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Where...

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
He falls in love with the blind girl

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
and she goes, what does red look like?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And he goes and gets a hot rock

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
from a stream and he puts it in her hand

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
and goes, that's red, and she's like, I love you!

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I'll tell you what.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
When I think of what to say to you,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I want to put a lizard in your hand

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
and go, that's me!

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I look like jealousy.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I look like weakness

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
wrapped in pride.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I'm a Christmas wreath

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
made of

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
pettiness and fragility

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
around a glowing rock.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I'm not glowing, what does that mean?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I'm like a piece of shit

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
but

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I'm very, very handsome.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I'll tell you what, Dan.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I'll tell you what, Dan Harmon,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
you sound like one handsome motherfucker.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Yeah!

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Well, all right, well, let's...

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
If you don't have...

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
If you're not under contract to be a regular podcast guest

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
on any other podcast...

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I can sign one!

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I have a brief understanding about a sign my name.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I will figure that shit out.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Well, let's...

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Let's figure it out.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
But we got to play D&D for now.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Yes, my favorite segment!

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Do it!

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
We'll say it for Dan's, everybody.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Dan's from...

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Dan's from Roger, everyone.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Wow.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Everybody hide, everybody hide.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Oh, my God!

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
My goodness.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
God damn it, that was an acid trip.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
And I wouldn't have met him

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
if Aaron from Game Grumps

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
hadn't needed to take a shit.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Because I was escorting Aaron

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
through the lobby right before the show started

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
and those guys were like funneling in

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
and so I was...

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Yeah, and then I saw a guy with a cane

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
and then he was like, is that Dan Harmon?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And I was like, oh, shit,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
will you come up and answer blind people questions?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
He's like, yeah, of course.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
It's just great.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I fucking love my life again. Who cares about Nazis?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Whatever.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
It's fine.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
They were so close.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Let them do their little marches.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
What are they going to do?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Just ignore them.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
What do they want to do? A next things?

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Who cares? A next everything.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
See where that gets you, Nazis.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Spencer, I like this white out.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Thank you.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
It is white out.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
White out tape.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Okay, so...

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
God, it just occurred to me because Dead said

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
this is my favorite part, the D&D part.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Yeah, of course, that would be because...

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Yeah.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
No, it puts me under pressure.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I'm like, yeah, of course.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
How many blind people listen to the show

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
and are like, fucking, they're going to play D&D

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
and then we do stupid shit and they're like,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
fucking you assholes.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
This is fine.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
It'll be fine.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
They're going to hate it anyway.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Because the blind are hateful.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Right. There's one thing we've learned.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I heard a rumor.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
That's why they're blind.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
They're being...

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
They're being punished.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
What are you going to do?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
What are you, a doctor?

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
I can't prove me wrong.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Wow.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
All right, Spencer.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Yeah, maybe if I said

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
the worst shit in the world, I'd end up president.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Fucking human oatmeal.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Human oatmeal.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
So you don't like oatmeal.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I think church was saying like...

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Not in my humanity, no.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I said in church, like,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Trump has the best way of doing it.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
He's like, I don't like oatmeal.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I don't like oatmeal.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I said in church, like, Trump has

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
the brain power of half an avocado.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And she's like, yeah, but that insults half an avocado.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Yeah.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
You can't compare him to anything without insulting the thing you're comparing him to.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Half an avocado wouldn't say

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
best regards.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
What did he say?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Sorry about the person that died.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Best regards.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Best regards to their family.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Best regards.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Best wishes.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
All right, Spencer.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Toodles.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I feel like we are poised

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
to maybe get into some action on this

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
round of D&D right now.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
We can only hope.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Are you ready to rock for a little recap here?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Oh, yeah.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
All right, let's do this damn thing.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
When we last met,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
what...

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Jesus Christ.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
What happened?

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
You had just scared

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
off the...

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I almost revealed what it was.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
The hooded figure

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
who was headed to the

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
church and you followed

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
it there where you met

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Patchens who was asleep and you woke

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
him up.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
He was amenable to your cause

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
quickly, but yet you argued with him

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
as if he was not on your side.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
I'd say you tried to convince him

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
a good three or four times,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
passed the close to help

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
you guys out.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
You planned an

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
infiltration

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
as Diarrhea Jr.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
snuck through a hallway

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and the rest of you climbed up on the roof.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Diarrhea Jr.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
went into the bedrooms and

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
saw a sleeping person and then you guys

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
followed him.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
There were horses that were great.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Oh boy, those horses.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
After meeting in the bedrooms

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
you awade to the

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
courtyard to plan your plan

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
with Patchens also

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
who had showed up.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Alright, there it is.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Sorry. That was no good.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So we did a little break

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
and I went off to go to

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
the library. You guys had quite...

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I think you were pitching a lot

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
of ideas and no one had actually...

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Dan wanted us to split up.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Carlos! Carlos!

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
As you're running off...

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Where are you going again?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I think you're running off yet. This is me

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Patchens and I'm yelling. I should be quiet.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Alright.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Hey guys, I drew you this map.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Chris, can you get the map?

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Oh, whoa.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Oh, damn.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
This is a map I drew by memory

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
of the Priory. See, on the right

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
there's that cluttered pathway.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
That's where Diarrhea Jr.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
snuck in. There's the interior courtyard.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Yeah.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Where's the clutter?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
It's the worst night to make a new

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
client friend. Oh, cluttered pathway.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Now we have visuals?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Where are the six doors

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
up here?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Oh.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Okay, well, Des, if you're

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
listening, we don't get it either.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
It's nothing. It's just...

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
It's not that helpful. It's scribbles.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Yeah. This whole game is scribbles.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Alright.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I was going to go into the library

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
to find the prior. Alright.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Right? Yeah.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
You're going east.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
West. East. Right now you're in the courtyard.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
The only door is to the north

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
of you.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I go into the north door.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Oh, my God.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
You see a door.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
It doesn't seem

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
heavily boarded. You don't see the nails

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
protruding through the door.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
I push the door.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Or pull. Is it a Norman door?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Does it make sense? Run that by me

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
one more time. Well, this door

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
looks like you should pull, but you should push, and it's kind of confusing.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Oh, yeah. It's one of those.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Alright.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
You do the wrong one.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
LAUGHTER

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
LAUGHTER

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
It's a one-digit combination,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
and you...

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
You can hack it.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Then I do the other one.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Alright. You pull the door open.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
It just opens.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Okay.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
There are boards kind of

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
reinforcing it, but largely it just

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
opens on its hinges.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
You enter the sanctuary.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
This is the most church-looking

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
part of the church. You know, church

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
pews that are in rows.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
There's kind of a center space

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
that's a hallway, and towards the front

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
of the pews is a kind of

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
raised platform

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
where the podium stands.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
The podium is where

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
the priest would stand

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
at the sermon, and behind him

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
you can see a kind of window.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
And through the window you can see

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
the glowing light of flames.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Yeah, it's like a symbol

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
of the church. So behind

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
the podium is flames. Also to the left

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
of the podium is a door.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
LAUGHTER

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Okay. I go through

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
that door. You don't got to use the map.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I just want to know where I am on it.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
You're in the courtyard.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
That's where you guys had convened.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
You mean the fenced

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
yard? We're by the horses.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Yeah. Okay.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I don't think it's labeled

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
courtyard in there. Okay.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Sorry, maybe someone

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
more sober can remember.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I did have a plan of splitting up,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
and we weren't all going to go...

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Last thing I remember you said, we should take these horses

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
for the rest of...

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Stop furthering your own

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
agenda, you...

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I'm going to get those horses.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I thought I was going to...

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I wanted to go check on the bedroom

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
of the proprietor.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Okay. Well, that's in the library.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Okay.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I'm going to the library.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Alright. You're with Jeff now.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
He's entering the library.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Hi.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I thought we were splitting up.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
You want to take the library?

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I'll take sanctuary.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Did you not check out the sanctuary?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I saw some flames.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Well, we're kind of in the same doorway.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
You guys are both currently in the sanctuary.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
We're in the sanctuary, but the library is right that way.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Oh, threshold of the library.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Let's go in.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Now that we're here, let's go into the library together.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
We've both checked out the sanctuary.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
There's no way to get to the library,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
except through the sanctuary.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
As far as I can tell, yes.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Alright. After you.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
After you, sir.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Aim to form beauty.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Alright, we go in.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I'll go first.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Alright. You go first.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Wait, where's Steve?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Yeah, let's have his turn.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Is he back with the fucking...

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
He was in the courtyard.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Loves those horses so much.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
The fenced yard.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
My friends left me.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Is it possible

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
to ride the horse into the...

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
into the library?

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
No, it's too big for the door.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Alright.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I guess I'm going to follow my friends in.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Okay.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
It's like we have a 16-year-old daughter.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Look, it's either I...

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
You let me open all the chests,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
or I get to take a horse.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
What?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Bargaining for... What do you mean?

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
That's... I mean, for doing my job here.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
We told you to look through the horses' saddlebags

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
to see if there was any identifying,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
like, you know, like, there's some pink slips.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Oh, I remember that.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
That was the last episode.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Alright, well, I'm in the library with the guys.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Well, yeah.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Okay, so we split up for three seconds,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
and now we're all in the library.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Good job, guys.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Alright, I missed you.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Okay, guys, keep your eye out for a sleeping prior,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
because he sleeps in here, you know.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Let's go upstairs.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
We look around the library.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Alright. You go into the library.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
It's not a giant library.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
It's only got kind of wall bookshelves

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
that don't go very high.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I'd say they go about seven feet tall.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
So it's not like a sprawling

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
book hop ellipse.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
It's just a pretty small library.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
There's a large table in the center,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
and it has a couple books on the table,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
like, you know, someone has been studying a little bit.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
And there's some other larger tables

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
for kind of, you know, more people

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
to sit at, and they seem relatively clean.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
There's also the stairway that goes up.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I poke through

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
the stack of books that's the largest

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
at the smallest table.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Okay, one is

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
improvised wards,

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
and the other is trap making 101,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
and the other is what to do

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
when your church is under attack.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Track making.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Yeah, how to make a track.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Give me a break,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
hack.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Hmm.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
What to do when your church is under attack?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I open the

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
cover.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
It's the

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
entire thing.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
There's not, how much time do you want

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
to spend on that?

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I want to go with the entire book.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
He's not a fast reader.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I walk up that staircase.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I want to take that book

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
and put it in my backpack.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
What to do when your church is under attack?

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Okay, great.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Can I have a pencil?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Okay, give me two seconds.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Sorry.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
You're going to add that book to your inventory?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Yeah, because I think, honestly,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I have a feeling.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Was that a best seller?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Are we always under attack

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
that that book had to be published?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Not all

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
cool things are popular.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I walk up that staircase.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
You go up the staircase.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
What's your

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
perception?

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Uh-huh.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Uh-oh.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
10.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Okay.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Wait, reply?

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
It says plus 10.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I'll buy it for now.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
You want me to pass this?

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
No, I just think it must be mistaken.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
But it might not be.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
It says 3, 5, 2, it says 10.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
I believe it.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I don't believe it.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
No, I believe it.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
I really do.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
This says 4.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
No, no, I'm kidding.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Yeah, that's 10 already.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Oh, man.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Who was right?

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
He was right.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
What do you call it?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
The level, the part you step on

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
of the stair,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
the horizontal stair part

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
of the stair is...

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
The step.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
The top platform

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
of the step

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
of three of the stairs

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
is really loose.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Whatever you call that,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
the subatomic portion of a set of stairs.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
So I

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
noticed that one of these stairs

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
is not an actual stair.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Three of the stairs are like loose

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
as if they're kind of up

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
higher than it would normally be.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
It looks like they've been tampered with.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
All right.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
It looks like

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
it was pulled up

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
and then a bunch of marbles were put under it

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
and then it was put back.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Oh, so I could have slipped

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
and broke my fucking ass.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Or, you know, any number of other things.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
And you still can't...

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I pulled that step

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
off the marbles and reveal

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
what's underneath. Marbles!

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
One of the marbles is gold.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
One of the marbles is gold?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Oh, yeah.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I'm gonna take that, motherfucker.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Put it in my little knapsack.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Yeah.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I got a gold marble!

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Jesus, this guy's really into marbles.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
He loves them.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
I continue up the staircase.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
All right, you do that.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Wait, what does he do with the...

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Is it like a section of three stairs?

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Yeah. What's he doing with it?

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I'm proving

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
that somebody home alone

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
to this fucking staircase.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
No, but now you're stepping...

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Like, from my perspective, all I watched

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
is you started going up stairs,

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
then you stopped, stared at the middle of the stairs,

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
then lifted three of the stairs up.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
There's marbles underneath.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
You took one, and now you're going up the stairs.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I presume with three stairs

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
in tow.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I just took the step part of that stair off

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
and put it aside.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
How is that trap gonna work?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I have so many questions for the person

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
who set this trap.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I think I was supposed to step on this,

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
and the marbles would shoot the stair

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
from underneath me, and I would go crashing to my death.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Where would the stairs go? Up.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Up? That's a ghostbusters joke.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Oh, they go up.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
I mean, can I move the stairs?

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
They were already moved.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Right, he moved.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
So we're just looking at a platform of marbles?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
No, it's just stairs

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
that have a

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
shitty part that's not meant to be stepped on.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
It was supposed to make me slip and fall.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
But the marbles are under the stairs.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
They're under the top.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
There was a board with marbles, and if you step on it,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
you go, whoa, if I could go smash and you hurt yourself.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Just pretend it makes sense.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Like they're like ball bearings.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Can I take

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
all the marbles?

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
What? I wanted those marbles.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Are the marbles heavy?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Are they better than my stones I used

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
in my slingshot?

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Yeah, but I have a gold one.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I investigate that gold marble.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Is there anything special besides it being gold?

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
It's light, and in your hand,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
when you move it around, you can feel it's

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
kind of sloshing slightly.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Sloshing?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I think you should eat it.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I'm adding a bunch of marbles to my inventory.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Nice.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
But I also think there was probably an element to this

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
that was meant to

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
be an alarm.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I think this gold marble is probably

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
like a ninja smoke bomb

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
or something like that.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
It looks special. It's got a slushie.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Flash bomb?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Yeah, like a ninja flash bomb.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
There's a ninja in the audience who

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
wants to make sure you can get your terms right.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
But we have the worst ninja ever.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
They're not ninja smoke bombs.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
They're flash bombs.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Tired of this shit.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Alright guys, I think I've defeated

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
at least one of the booby traps

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
in the staircase. Let's proceed

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
up the staircase together.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Alright, the rest of the staircase, uneventful.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
You get to the top, the door's locked.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Okay.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I use the marbles on the door.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Are any of you guys...

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
No.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Fuck.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I don't have any lockpicking skills.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I mean, this is just like weird...

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
weird word.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I lightly knock on the door.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I lightly go...

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Not a stir, not a nothing.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I think you should light it on fire.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
No.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Is there a window nearby?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
No, this is like a narrow hallway.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
It's pretty dark and stuff.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
None of you guys can shrink

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
or turn into a ghost or anything.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
I can light things on fire.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Millennials.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Alright, wait.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Someone just kick the door in.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Like this.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Let's just kick the door in.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Man, if we're going to do that.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
In theory, there's an old guy sleeping behind there

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
that is or isn't a floating vampire

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
that just got home.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Are we looking for the event that's happening

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
that could involve the corpse of that child?

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
That happens later, right?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
What?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Don't answer me.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Where's Patchens?

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Patchens?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Patchens?

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Hey guys.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
This guy just sneaks up on us every time.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I was in the library.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Hey Patchens, do you have keys for this door?

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
No, maybe there's some somewhere else.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I'll go look.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Okay, yes please.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Go do that.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I found some keys.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Holy shit!

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
He's like the paperclip in Microsoft Word.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I hate Patchens.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Patchens, do my taxes.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Open the door for us, Patchens.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Alright, he opens the door.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
There's no one inside.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
It's a very bare room.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
There's like a single dresser with a mirror on it.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
And on the dresser is like a bowl of water.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
And there's a small table in a chair

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
that's kind of like a desk.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
It has a candle.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
The candle is low, but it's not lit.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
And there's no one in the bed.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
The bed's not even made.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I go tumble out of the bed

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
and like lay backwards.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Like I'm like...

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I put the candle out and drink the water.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
The candle's out, but you drink the water.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
It tastes like hands.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
It tastes like what?

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Hands.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Wash their hands in that shit, man.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
You like that hand water?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
What the fuck was I thinking?

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I roll around in the bed giggling.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
You gotta make your own fun around here.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
He drank hand water.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I love water so much.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I hope you love hands.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Split the diff, motherfucker.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I examine the room some more.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Is there all there is to be seen in that room?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Yeah, it seems like he doesn't actually keep anything

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
more than just the clothes and the dresser in here.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Like not even any writing tools

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
or like books or anything.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I feel the bed to see if it's warm

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
and see if anybody's been there recently.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
It looks like Dan's been in it.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Yeah, the bed hasn't been in otherwise though.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Okay, I'll tell you what though.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Under the bed is where I look

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
and next...

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Go for it.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
I drape myself over the edge of the bed

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
while still laying on it.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
I'm being playful. I'm like a little kitty cat.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I'm like Elizabeth's shoe

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
in the cold open of

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Adventures in Babysitting.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I'm just feeling sprightly.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
When did they get a groan?

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
One of the most amazing performances in cinematic history.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I drape my head

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
and look under the bed.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
You don't see anything.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Guys, I think we're in the wrong room.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Then I go like this

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
in keeping with my Elizabeth's shoe persona

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
in the 80s in general.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
When I don't see anything, I go

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I do one of those things

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
where the lower lip goes

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
outside the upper lip

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
and you exhale and so your

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
bangs kind of like flicker.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Right.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I'm hoping Des knows what I'm talking about.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
It was an 80s thing.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Girls would do it.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
My homework's gone

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
and it would be really cute like your bangs would go.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Carlos, DJ,

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
let's go back downstairs.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
This room seems clear.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I saw an interesting looking flame at the back of the sanctuary.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Should we go investigate that maybe?

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
What?

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
They're already upstairs.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
That's only the bottom floor plan.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.000
The upstairs floors aren't depicted on the map.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
One thing's for sure.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
The audience is immersed.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Are there any of the doors in this room

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
or just the way we came in?

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Wait, can we...

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Look, this is not...

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Look, this is not...

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
This is not the best suggestion,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
but there are sleeping people, right?

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
We could like...

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
interrogate one about where this thing is happening.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Yeah, last episode Steve found a sleeping person.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Right.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Jeff looked him in the face

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
and he was asleep.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
We saw him before, but he didn't...

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
nobody of importance that we knew of.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
We should just...

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Let's go back down real quick.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Since we're right here, we go downstairs,

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
we're right in the sanctuary.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Let's go investigate that flame real fast.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
This guy just loves fire.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
I know, it's my thing.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Why don't we take a look at it?

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
All right, yeah, yeah.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
If it's a dead animal, we go wake up sleeping town.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
No, we're going to wake up sleeping town no matter what.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
All right.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Let's check out the fire.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
You go back into the sanctuary.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
You can see there's a door behind the podium

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
where the guy can go.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Like the priest might after a sermon

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
walk back there.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Above the door there's a large open window

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
that just displays the fire.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
It kind of just displays the fire,

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
almost like it's supposed to showcase

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
and frame the fire for people sitting in the sanctuary.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
So yeah, there's a door

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
to this fire room, so to speak.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I tried the door.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
All right, it just opens.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
What did you say?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
It just opens.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
What?

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
The door opens.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I'm picturing it's kind of like that's like

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
the background behind Letterman.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
It's like a diorama.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Yeah, okay.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
You open the door and inside you see a giant

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
great brazier of flame.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
It's a giant red, you know,

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
normal color flame. It's not like a silver flame,

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
but this is like a symbol

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
that's in some of the nicer churches

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
just kind of to remind everyone

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
that it's the church of the silver flame

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
and here's a flame.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Next to it you can see some, what do you call it?

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Kind of like urns or basins

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
that are full of presumably holy water.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
out of the corner of your eye you can see

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
you can see one of the walls

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
is fucked up.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
There's a fucked up wall over there.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Yeah.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Upon closer inspection

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
you see that the wall has a thin

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
outline as if it might be a secret door.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Dude, what am I?

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
I'm like Batman.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Yeah, you're the only one that sees it.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
I have like Arkham mode.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
I don't even need to try.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Okay.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
I understand like why am I perceiving it

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
because of a...

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
The meta-gaming answer is because you rolled a 19.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Oh, you were just...

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Oh, sometimes you're rolling for us

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
and not asking us for stuff.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Often.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
You're in the zone.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
You're in the zone right now.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Well, I find...

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
So I'm going to be like gentlemen

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
it would appear

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
to be a featureless room.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Emphasis on the appear.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
One question I always ask myself

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
in religion is

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
how much is showmanship

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
and how much is

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
illusion?

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
And I lean on the

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
door like I...

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I just want to be like Doctor Who, you know?

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Yeah.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
You lean on the door.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
You could see the door kind of move

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
as if it closes. So it's like a secret door

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
that was slightly open and now kind of closes.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
So it's kind of perfectly hidden now.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
What you gentlemen don't know is that I just

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
leaned on a secret door

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
and closed it.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Can you open it again?

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Can I?

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Open it again?

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
I'll...

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
find out.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Can I?

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Well, it's like a wall. It's like a brick kind of

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
stone wall. If you were trying to open a secret

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
door on a brick stone wall, how would you do it?

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
What are you trying to do?

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Gentlemen!

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Query!

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
How would you open a wall?

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
That was already a jar, but you leaned on it

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
and closed it.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
And now you're trying to be fancy pants about it.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Maybe you leaned on the wrong side.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
You leaned on the closing side and not the opening side.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Sure. You go around

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
to the opening side.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
What are you, my dog?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Like...

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Like...

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
You had to push on one part and then it opens

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
and you...

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I go like this. It's like a medicine cabinet

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
where you, hopefully, it has one of those magma-

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Oh, yeah. No, it is. It is. It's like a plate.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Yeah.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
And it goes back to how open it was before.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Oh, nice.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Let's open it.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Let's open it all the way now.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Or maybe let's ask ourselves this and I lean on it

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
and close it. God damn it!

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Alright, I close it.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Maybe what we need is a master of doors.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Oh, you found one. Click it.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Door master!

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I whisper.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Open the door. I feel like we...

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
The sun's gonna come up.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Alright, you open the door.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
You pull the door open and you feel some resistance.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
But you pull it open

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
and you hear a snap.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
There's a string

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
that you see snap as you pull the door open.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
And it... What does it do?

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
It, like, it sets off a minor chain reaction

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
where, like, a rock...

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
We set off a Rube Goldberg.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Yeah, a rock that was attached to the string

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
falls on, like, a water skin

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
and the water skin squirts a line of oil

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
that kind of blasts towards you guys.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Pinch as a barrel!

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
What?

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Alright. Goonies reference.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
That's why I said I said I'm booty-straps.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Alright.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
So, Jeff, what's your character's name?

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I'm sorry.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
My character's name's Chad, the firelight.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Chad dodges out of the way,

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000
but the rest of you two guys get sprayed by the oil

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
as it squirts directly into the great fire flame.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Fuck.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And it connects the fire and the fire burns you guys

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
for damage.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Four. Four.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
You each take four damage.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Oh.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Yeah, it isn't super loud.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Okay, alright.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Am I still on fire?

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
No.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
It was pretty fast.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
I'm fine. I got out of the way.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Inside the door, it's just like a tiny closet.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
It's got a small hole in the ground

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
with a ladder leading downwards.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Oh, yeah.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
We just found a legit dunge.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
This shit is...

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
This shit is toast dunge.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I go down that ladder.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Alright.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
This underground space is kind of...

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
We should probably close down soon, right?

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I think I could leave it on a cliffhanger.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Please.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
This underground space is kind of like a cellar.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
The walls are rough cut stone

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
and the floors are made of the same smooth floor tiles

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
used in the church.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Barrels line the walls and on the far side of the room

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
in this flickering light,

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
you can see several robe figures huddled around a table.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
The person furthest from you

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
holds a light, an object

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
that you can't see for the intense glow it emits.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
And the others cower back in fear,

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
revealing the table.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000
On the table is a messy pile of corpses,

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
like two or three mutilated bodies

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
just ripped apart and just placed in like a nest

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
of gore and violence

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
in various stages of decay.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
There's other corpses elsewhere.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
He lowers...

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
lowers the glowing object

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
and you can smell it burning

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
as everything starts to melt on the table

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
and expand like marshmallows

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
in a campfire bubbling and smoking

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
and gooping together.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
And then everyone descends on the goop

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
and they start bathing in it and eating it.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
And their bodies begin to warp

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000
and change into weird shape-shifting monsters.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Sense motive?

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Um...

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Cliffhanger!

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Cliffhanger!

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Very much.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Yeah, Spencer Crittendenyour Game Master.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Cliffhanger, yeah.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Well, one thing's for certain,

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
our next D&D is going to be some fucking real deal shit.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Yeah, I guess it's going to start, yeah.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Let's hear it, Steve Leithy, everybody!

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Woo!

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Dan and Aaron from Game Grumps.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
The Game Grumpers.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
The Grumper Dittles.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Jason Rodger, Blind Guy Questions,

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
our new favorite segments.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Spencer Crittendenyour Game Master.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Woo!

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Let's thank Church, Kevin, Sarah, Zach.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Who the fuck else?

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Chris. I don't know.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Nolan, everybody else.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Um...

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
I'm Jeff Davis, you're going to come taller.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Your mayor is Dan Harmon.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Thank you so much for coming, everybody.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
We will see you on the flip-flop.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Drive fast, take chances.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Ladies and gentlemen, see you next time.
