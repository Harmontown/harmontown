00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Hello, Hurray and Hurrah, welcome all from MacArthur Park.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
Harmontown is now in session. We're doing a giving away sale right now.

00:35.000 --> 00:51.000
Everything must go. Let's bring out a 1994 Rob Schrab. A 1994 almost mint condition Rob Schrab.

00:51.000 --> 01:08.000
Rob Schrab. Rob Schrab, only 4,000 miles on him.

01:08.000 --> 01:21.000
The all new 2020 Spencer Crittenden. 2020 Dice, four wheel drive.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
And let's bring out the 1973 Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

01:29.000 --> 01:39.000
Oh boy. Thank you for coming out to my show. Thank you.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Thank you, Laura. You're not done. You're not done.

01:43.000 --> 01:55.000
We got two hours. The whole show. She has to do that for two hours.

01:55.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, everything must go. That bit was pretty classic, Jeff.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Classic Jeff.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
It's like two minutes before the show he goes,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
She got walk off a plus.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
Oh yes, Laura everybody.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
She knew it was a self, I don't want to be like Trump, but she knew what she signed up for.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
But that's her Halloween costume. And then Jeff was like, should we ever go out and do this thing?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
And I'm like, anything you want.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah, we're fun.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
And Jeff's like, so how should I do it? How should we do it?

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
And I'm like, why don't you do it like this? And I was like, well, I guess maybe like a used car thing.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Then you can introduce us each as if we're like.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
The bit we just saw.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Pretty close.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
The bit you just saw for $5 every month.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
But then you're like, let's bring out a 1994 Spencer Crittenden.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
And I'm like, well, maybe a couple more car phrases before.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
You want to do it again?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I don't want to do it again.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
How about we do the whole thing over again?

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
But you, you are me and you do introduce everybody.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Can I wear the costume?

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Man, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't like pimping the audience to.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
You just like haranguing me for not doing it.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I just thought it was kind of funny.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
It was like, it's just classic.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
It gives it, you're like, should we do this?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yes, we should.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
And you're like, how?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
How do we do it?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
We've lost.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Oh, here we go.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I went to Norway.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
I was at an animation festival in Fredrikstad.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Great.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
I think your story will have to be on hold for at least five minutes.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
What the fuck?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Rob's got a tablecloth.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Rob has got $5.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Everybody you can watch.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
It's Nosferatu.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
What is the eyebrows?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
The eyebrows are like, I did it.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
I nailed it.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
What did you do?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
You didn't do anything.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
You, yeah.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
I got off of one of your piece of shit chairs.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
And there's a stack of considerably more comfortable chairs right there.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
A stack.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
A stack with cushions.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
And a Dracula cape.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
So I shit my pants.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
In Norway?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Well, on the plane.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Oh, no.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
From Norway to Heathrow.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
The whole time?

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
I thought, well, I was kind of sitting in it without knowing it the whole time.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
How do you not know you shit your pants?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
It happens.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
It happens.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I woke up.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I think you know.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
I think you know.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
You're suspicious.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
You are suspicious.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
This is a first.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
As we know, I've had many stories where I didn't know what I thought was a fart was a shit.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
But then pretty much the story ends with it coming out into my pants.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
But this was different.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I woke up from the hotel room the day of our departure.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I was kind of blowing a lot of farts.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
I drank a lot of beer and ate a lot of delicious stuff.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Farting all over the place.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
They're big, empty, windy farts.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
They're not really hurting anybody.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
They're not bothering anybody.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
They're just sort of...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Victimless farts.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
They're loud and fun.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
We're laughing about it.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
We get to the airport.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
We get on the airplane.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I get another big one brewing in me.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
But I'm not going to do it in the cabin.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
This is a flight from Norway to Heathrow then connecting back to LA.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
How long of flight is that?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
London being the Chicago of Europe.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
So this is like a two hour flight, two and a half hour flight?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah, two hour flight.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
On one of those flights where they're happy to take your first class money.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
But the plane is simply a bus.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
And for your first class money, what they'll do is they'll take that money

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
and they'll put a tray in the middle seat in the front four rows.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
Those people all paid extra money so they didn't have to rub their arm on a poor person.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
And that's first class.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
But you can't buy people not rubbing your fucking head as they walk by,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
people bumping you with their jackets.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I mean, everyone's crammed in the same fucking thing.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
That's why you got to get the window seat, baby.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
No, that would be Cody's.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
So I go to the bathroom during that flight and I'm peeing.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
And men, when we pee, if you've ever been in a public restroom with men at urinals,

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
they take the opportunity and maybe it's partially, it kind of happens while you're peeing.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
It tends to happen, it's like a time to fart.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
And sometimes you're in a men's room and somebody's like,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
like at the urinal and you kind of have this reaction like,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
what the fucking guy's farting?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
In the bathroom.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah, but it's...

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
How dare you?

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
Oh, are you my joke's agent?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
He's here, everybody.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
My joke has representation.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Is this a package deal and this joke?

07:50.000 --> 07:59.000
Or the fuck did you think I was pointing out, you fuck?

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
So anyways, I go to the men's room or the people's room on the plane.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
There's no men's room.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Planes are the future.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
And I'm peeing and then I just let out this...

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
It's loud.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
It was loud.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
It's kind of a contrabassion.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Because I've been sitting on it and I've been very gassy,

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
but I've been sitting on this one.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So buildovers are like...

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Horn of Gondor.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
And then I go back and I sit for an hour and 57 minutes

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
and then we land in Heathrow

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
and everyone starts doing their little restless bustle

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
and getting ready to get up and I'm moving around

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
and I'm like, oh, did I sweat in my butt crack that much?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Is there substance?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
And then I kind of stood up in the seat

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
and I'm like, that feels like...

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Wrong.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
That feels wrong and also it smells a little bit like...

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Like butt release.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Well, because smell is like this crazy sense memory.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
The thing I always, when I smell like diaper smell,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I always remember my sister's hospital

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
because I was like, when I was a kid,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
that was the first time I'd ever been around like adult poopoos.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
Was this institution where my sister was being housed

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
and I've told the story before about the Moo Moo guy.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
How much time had elapsed since you think you released the poopoos

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
and then you noticed...

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Well, it was when I said two hours.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Two hours.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
And so I guess I was just sitting on it like...

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And then I'm walking in the airport and I'm like,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I got to wipe my ass, honey.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And she's like, why did you shit your pants?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
I'm like, no.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
That's crazy.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Obviously not.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
That would be insane.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
If I did that, then I would have reacted to that.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
I just have to wipe my sweaty, fat ass.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Traveling, it's an airport.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I guess this is something that happens.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I guess I just have to wipe my sweaty ass.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
And then we get to the airport lounge and it's all packed and stuff.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
And there's a guy sitting there looking at his phone.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
It's one of these... The bathroom is all these fancier...

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
America tends to go for the metal stalls.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
But in Europe, you're more likely to get these closets.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Teak.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Maybe some exotic hardwoods.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
And so it's just a room lined with all these little rooms

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
that are impenetrable.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
It's hard to see, vacancy or occupied.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
I guess there's a little red thing.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
But it's not really beamed out to your eyeball.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
You kind of have to crouch and look.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And there's a guy standing there, thumbing on his phone.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
It looks like he's probably... What the hell is he doing?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
He's probably waiting for one of these bathrooms.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
It means they're all occupied, right?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
So I get behind him.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I'm waiting and waiting and looking around.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
And there's a bathroom with its door kind of not all the way closed.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
And I wait and I wait and I'm looking at it.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
And I'm hoping he sees my eye contact and then he realizes

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
maybe he missed a bathroom opening.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
And then I finally go, is that one open over there?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
And he's kind of like blithely.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
I suppose he's like, go for it.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Govner.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
He didn't say governor, but like he is like...

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
He's just like chickadeiro or something like that.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
It was like go nuts or something like blithe kind of like have a blast.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
The old school British phrase, go nuts.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
So then I went over there.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I open it up.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
And it's a handicap version of all these things.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
So I'm like, ah, ah, ah.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
And I look back at him and he, I don't know if he's like, you know,

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
is it like Forest Whitaker in the dream and crying game where he's like laughing?

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
I was like, haha, it's a handicap style.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I told you to, I told you to check it out.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
And now you're...

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I never saw grinding.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Crying game.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Oh.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
It doesn't matter.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Don't get distracted.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I need that.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
So now I get it.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Okay.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
So, so I just like, I got the door open.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
It's a bathroom.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
There's no, there's nobody, there's no special needs people in sight.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I'm kind of like, I don't know what the etiquette is.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
I don't know if that guy was like...

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
No cop, no stop.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
No Forest Whitaker.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
You're free to go shittaker.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
And I, and I have a sweaty ass.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
So I'm like, all right.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Well, I need this.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
So up till now, you don't know that like what's, what is actually...

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
He's in denial.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Okay.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Gotcha.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
So I go in and I...

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
We're two hours 15 minutes into you having to shut yourself.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I unbutton my pants.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I pull them down and grab the toilet paper.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
I wipe at the sweaty butt and I pull it away.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
And it's like, holy fudge.

12:46.000 --> 12:53.000
Like, like, like just covered like as if I just took a shit, which I guess I did.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
Not to be disgusting.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
But opaque, not opaque, chunk.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Just gross.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Just like, imagine taking a shit and then fucking sitting in it.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Like a turd?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
No, that's not like an intact turd.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
A turd wouldn't like, it's not like a cartoon.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
So it isn't anything then.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Go continue with your...

13:17.000 --> 13:24.000
Wait, Jeff, what did you write down?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Holy fudge.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
It's important that someone documents the shit.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
So now that I'm seeing it, I'm like, okay, well, that wasn't sweat.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Okay.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
And then I'm like, well, hopefully it was just one of those things where there goes like

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
a, you know, that wet of a, that productive of a fart.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
And like, and it's just like, I had like, like my big bear like ass cheeks just kind of contained

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
this grand canyon of poop and like, I wiped it away and I look in the underwear.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
I'm like, whoa.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Oh no.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Oh, Hershey's Rorschach.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Fucking like...

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It's like the Watchmen in there.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
How do you spell Rorschach?

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Watchmen in your pants.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Ha ha ha ha.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Rock shots, journal.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Take off my shoes.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Take off my pants.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Take off my shoes.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Yeah.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Take off your pants.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Take off your pants.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
You got to take off your shoes.

14:23.000 --> 14:31.000
I take off my underwear, gingerly step out of them like tires in the, in an army training

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
course and fold up the really unreturnable pair of meundies and...

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Oh no.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
And drop the spawn garter.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Which, by the way, are made of the softest micro modell.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
And they have 100% guarantee so you can send them right back if you're not satisfied.

14:51.000 --> 14:57.000
Well, you can, you can take that up with the good people of British Airways.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, yeah.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Keep going.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Keep going.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
Whatever poor physically challenged person that actually had a right to use that particular

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
bathroom is now going to go in there and go like, oh, who fucking shit in the garbage

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
can.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
In the toilet area.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
And the ironic answer is, oh, me fucking Mr. Physical Privilege.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
Mr. Bounding around on two great legs I had to fucking like ruin their haven.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
And I had to put on my pants with no underwear.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Wait a second.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Can I walk it back for a second?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
You took your shoes off.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
You took your trousers off.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
You took your meundies off.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Disposed of them?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
I assume.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Put them in the garbage can.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
More or less.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Put them in the garbage can in the stall with you?

15:44.000 --> 15:52.000
I mean, it's a handicap stall in a country that doesn't really, in an airport lounge,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
it's like more into water closets than stalls.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
So we're talking about like kind of a small room.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Okay.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
So there was a trash can.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah.

15:59.000 --> 16:07.000
So you pitched your soiled meundies into the bin and then you cleaned yourself up.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Hopefully.

16:08.000 --> 16:16.000
Did your, did meundies save your trousers from the, from the climate action?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Of course they did.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
But I will say.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Spencer, why do you think they did?

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
That's because of micromodal fabric.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
All right.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
But I will say in all fairness, I was wearing brown pants.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
So.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Oh, that's pro tip.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
But also a margin of error in my data.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I think I got away clean, but.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
All right.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
So if I didn't.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I don't know if that's right.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
You're not, you're, you're going commando.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I go commando back to my duffel bag.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I look at Dino and Cody and I go.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Dino's in the bathroom with you?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
No.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I go back to the lounge.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Gotcha.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
And I get my, I get a new pair of meundies out of my duffel bag.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
And as I look at them and go.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
You know, and Trump's on TV bragging about how he killed the head of ISIS.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
He killed ISIS single handedly.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
And I'm like, there, you know, it's, it's a day of gives and takes.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Dave triumphs and defeats.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I am having a bad day.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
The president is having a good day.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
That's usually how it works.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
So I, I, I salute the television.

17:30.000 --> 17:38.000
And hey, hey, did you guys know that when you're in Europe, you know, it's, it's crazy because

17:38.000 --> 17:52.000
like their news coverage makes him look like a fucking idiot.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
It's probably the only time in our nation's recent like post television history when there

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
actually is no fucking disparity because it's like just as mean to be objective with that

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
guy.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
He's just like, but you know, fucking, uh, Al Jazeera says the same shit about him as

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
CNN because it's just like the president who just said he was nine feet tall and his dick

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
is a whistle.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
Like how, what, what, what negative spin are you going to put on that?

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
Like you either, you either pretend that's cool or, or, or you just tell people what

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
happened again.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
Um, so anyways, yeah, uh, I went back in and I, uh, used a different stall thereby realizing

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
how lucky I was because yeah, the other stalls, they don't have garbage bins and, uh, I don't

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
know what I would have done.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
I would have walked out with a fucking lot of shit in a, in the softest fabric known to

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
man.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
I was worried for you.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't know.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
I've had to throw out underwear before in a public place.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
So.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
So you go back in.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
You change your, uh, a little quiet there.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
You do me on these change.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
You put the brown trousers back on.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Yep.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
No harm, no foul.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Yep.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
All's well that ends well.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
No foul.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Some.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Soiler alert.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Hmm.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Oh boy.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Yeah.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Good one.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Oh boy.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
Bring out the, the, bring out the inflatable person.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Oh boy.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
Should she come out every time you nail one?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
I'll tell you what.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I could use vodka right now.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Oh shit.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
We better bring out Steve Levy at some point.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.360
Oh, so before the show happened, Steve Levy came out a few times and was treated to just

19:44.360 --> 19:48.560
a thunderous applause and audience reaction.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.000
Was that because of last week when we talked about it or was that just organic?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Okay.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
I'm hearing some yeses.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
I thought so.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
What?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
What happened?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Good to hammer out.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
Well, we just kind of, we kind of joked about how Levy came out before the show.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.000
The show was tremendously delayed last time, more than usual, and, uh, like, as a.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Oh.

20:10.000 --> 20:26.000
Cause that joke was so good earlier and it's a tender moment for us all to enjoy.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Yeah.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
There's no, by the way, there's no guests tonight.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
So this is it.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
We got a person in there.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
That is correct.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
I should do something about how many more.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
I'm bad at math.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
How many more?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Here's something.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Five.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Five.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
So this, this is the five more after this or this five more after this.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
This one and five more.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
So six.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Six.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Five.

20:59.000 --> 21:06.000
One and five five point seven two.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Right.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
About.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Yeah.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
What did Dan here?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I just heard this like high-pitched tone.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
That's that fan that, that's that fan.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
What inflates the wacky with lady and played a warm, playing tube man.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
But there's a lady in there.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Woman.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
What?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Woman.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Not man.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I said it bad.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
Oh, I thought you were saying I should say woman instead of lady.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
No, you should though.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Why not?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Don't.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
We'll talk after the show.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
There was a.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
There was a.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
But we won't though.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
No, we won't.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
I'm busy.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
What did Dan here?

21:47.000 --> 21:56.000
There was a, there was a lady animator legendary Norwegian lady animator getting a

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
lifetime achievement award at the festival.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
And the host was going over her credentials.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
And I swear he said, Cody and I both heard the same thing.

22:10.000 --> 22:20.000
He said, and of course, if you are familiar with animation at all, then you know the movie

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Poop Van Two.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Poop Van Two?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
She worked on that.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
And then he just kept going and Cody and we're like poof it.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
And then afterwards we were asking about it, but no one, no one could tell it.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
No one was like, Oh, no, no, no.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Goop.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Gum.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Do.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
It's a, it's like our Jumanji.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Like there was nothing.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
No one, no one remembered hearing it.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
No one could explain.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
It was, I swear he said Poop Van Two.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
Now, and the only, the only differing opinion about that was Dino who heard Poop Man Two.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Cody and I both heard Poop Van Two.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
And it's like the idea that there, I mean, that sounds like a great animated film.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
The sequel of one at least.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And then there was, and then there was more.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
What do you think, what do you think Poop Man Two does answer the questions of Poop Man?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I don't know, but I know Poop Man Two.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
I don't, I wouldn't even care about, but Poop Van Two.

23:16.000 --> 23:24.000
I think this is like a great movie because like, there probably is a Poop Man in that movie, but he's accompanied by three to five friends and a dog.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And they're all pretty comfortable.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Poop Van Two.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
I don't know.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
I just picture like kind of a cool like road movie or something.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Poop Van Two.

23:33.000 --> 23:43.000
Like Poop, there was a movie called Poop Van and it, and in spite of its obstacles, it did so well that people were like, yes, another.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
They heard that the Poop Man was so long, they cut it into two pieces.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
It was like a, like a kill bill.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
They had to use that special fork that we all keep in the bathroom to break it up.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
You know what I'm talking about?

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
That special fork we all keep in the bathroom.

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
Another thing that the guy said, which he said she also did.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
He goes right on his phone after saying that.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
I'm looking up.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
I'm looking up the body.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
You're looking up your bathroom.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Is it maybe Port Van Two?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Pork Van.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Port Van.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Port Van.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Yeah, I'm looking up for filmography.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Oh, that would have meant to.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
It's probably very likely that that's what he said.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
It's less likely that she worked on both that and Poop Van Two.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
There's also Two Van Toby.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Two Van Toby.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
What did you think that was, Dan?

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
But another thing that she worked on, apparently, that they were going to show that weekend,

24:48.000 --> 25:02.000
the guy said something like he goes, and she just did work on the only educational video

25:02.000 --> 25:12.000
about sexual assault of kindergartners for kindergartners.

25:12.000 --> 25:18.000
And it was just the way that he kept like, like, he kept, it was like, he was like,

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
I don't know, it just sounded like such an inappropriate, like, advertisement.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
Like, like, if you thought sexual assault of kindergartners was a fucking thing.

25:26.000 --> 25:32.000
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
It seemed like the audience every time he was before he let in would be like,

25:36.000 --> 25:42.000
the first animated, wait a second, for kindergarten.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
I don't think it's a good financial model to really like pitch your film for kindergarteners

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
because they don't have a lot of discretionary money.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
Well, I don't think, I think this was probably a job that she did for the government

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
because it was educational.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
I think the budget was probably fixed.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
How was your time overall in Scandinavia?

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
It was a lot of fun. Those are good people.

26:06.000 --> 26:13.000
I like, you know, they're self-described as a kind of like compartmentalized people

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
that they're sort of, you know, it's a colder climate.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
And whereas you might think, oh, that makes them all warm and fuzzy,

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
they're a little more, you know, more than a few of them kind of self-described

26:28.000 --> 26:36.000
the Norwegian people as being kind of a, not cold, but like, yeah,

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
I would say compartmentalized. They didn't use that word but listening to them describe it.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
That's sort of what they're describing.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
Like, which kind of, you know, it's like, they like to get drunk

26:46.000 --> 26:54.000
and like they sort of view getting drunk as like its own thing and what happened there stays there.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
And one of them described the culture as like sort of like,

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
and this is one person like they might be their own point of view.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
This isn't like a traditional thing, but like, you know, like in Norway,

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
you might get drunk and like have a great time with somebody,

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
even sleep with them or something and then you see them the next day at a grocery store

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
and I just don't pretend you act like you never met them.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
That could be that own person's take on life.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
But the general picture all kind of averaged out was just sort of like this kind of Nordic,

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
like, yeah, compartmentalized, which I do respect.

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
As long as it's not dishonest and nobody gets hurt, I like the idea of distance,

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
professional distance and things, they're not big huggers, they said and things like that.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
But there's a difference between that and not being nice.

27:46.000 --> 27:53.000
They're really wonderfully nice and funny people and they all kind of look like Spencer or Dave Kline.

27:53.000 --> 27:59.000
And they're just very, like, it's hard to escape the Viking thing

27:59.000 --> 28:09.000
because they're so jolly and, you know, broad-shouldered and kind of like, you know, hyperbolic and fun.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
So it was great drinking with them. Like Vikings. When I think...

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
Fun, fun Vikings. When I think fun, I think Vikings.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
Before the circus came to town, the Vikings did.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
I was only in, like, I was in Stavanger, Norway once and there was a bar.

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
People got in fights, like a middle-aged guy tackled a slightly older guy

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
and hip tackled him like a linebacker.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
And then they got up and then danced together and had a drink

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
and it was like no harm, no foul, no blood, no ambulance, everything was groovy.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
No antelopes.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
What's a hip tackle?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
What's a who?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
What's a hip tackle?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Like, will you tackle somebody with a hip?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Their hip?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Yes.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Okay.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
I mean, if you tackle somebody with your own hip, I think that's just called doing the booty bump.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah, that's what I think when I hear hip tackle.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
There were more than, there was a handful of people who traveled like great distances by train and car

29:05.000 --> 29:12.000
from all over Europe to come and just see me in particular because of Harmontown ending.

29:12.000 --> 29:19.000
It's surprising to encounter people from Norway that were like such big Harmontown fans.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Why wasn't I invited?

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
Because I guess we didn't know that I was going there to talk to them.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
How do they say Rick and Morty in Norwegian?

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
Rick and Morgan.

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
I did try to write a song in Norwegian thinking, maybe if I chipped away over a couple of days,

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
like oh man, writing a song in a foreign language is like that you don't actually know.

29:51.000 --> 29:58.000
Because in English, you're a brilliant songwriter.

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
Yeah, getting an Emmy for it is some kind of metric.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
All right.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Okay.

30:05.000 --> 30:12.000
I mean, I never bring it up, but you kind of did.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
What was your eyes into the Norwegian language that you thought you could do it?

30:17.000 --> 30:24.000
Well, it was more the eyes. I stopped short of trying to rhyme because it was such a challenge

30:24.000 --> 30:30.000
to just, because you're thinking in a melody and then you're thinking of syllables.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
So then you're thinking English syllables and then you're like, oh, the other day I had a sausage

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
and you're like, that's the right amount of syllables.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Now you're going to put that in Google Translate.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
You're going to find out how to say the other day I had a sausage in Norwegian.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
There's going to be a totally different amount of syllables.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
So now are you going to adjust the melody?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Are you going to rephrase?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Are you going to search around for words?

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
And then on top of that, now you've got to look at the word that it's ending with, I guess,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
which is going to be like Margar Bar.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
And you're going to be like, oh, I know what rhymes with that.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
No, you don't.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
You don't know a single word that rhymes because you don't know the language.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
So I was kind of like, wow, that was interesting.

31:08.000 --> 31:16.000
I kind of thought in the day of Google Translate and I underestimated the difficulty.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Did you get one done?

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
No, I got like the first line of something done and I kind of tried it out at my panel.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Did you try finding like a Norwegian rhyme dictionary?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I don't know.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
What would it be called?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
I don't know the word for rhyme.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
Well, if you typed in Norwegian rhyme dictionary.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
You know what?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
This guy.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
I didn't try that.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Yeah.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
You figured out how I could have done it.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Did you pick up?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
I think it's always a good thing when you travel.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
I don't know if you're being serious or not.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Well, I just sort of like, what are you, my mom?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Like, what is your problem?

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
You've been shitty to me since I sat down here.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
I haven't seen you in weeks.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
I come in.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Hey, how you doing?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
You look at the floor.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
You don't say anything.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
And you're just shitting on everything I do.

32:04.000 --> 32:11.000
And I came out here because there's only six episodes left.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Five and a half.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
I didn't have to.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I could have stayed home with Kate and Lolly.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
And now you're shitting on everything I say.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
What did I ever do, man?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
You know, God damn well.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
No, I don't.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
That's why I'm asking.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
That you come here whenever you want.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
And it's always when your dog and your wife kick you out.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
No, it's not true.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
There's nobody waiting for you that you could have been with.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
No, that's not true.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
It was this or being under a bridge.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
How would you know?

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
How would you know?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
What is your fucking problem?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Because I've known you for 20 years.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
More than that.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Yeah.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
So it's like...

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
So what?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
What?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
30 years.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
So I know what it's like to be your dog and Kate.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
I do.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I can only imagine.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
I know that every once in a while, they're going to be like,

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
why don't you go do the heart attack show?

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
No, don't even.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Don't even put words in, Kate.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
And you have to pull like straws out of your lips

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
and like fucking cotton squabs off your eyebrows

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
that you glued with toothpaste.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Because you thought it would be funny in the middle of Kate

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
probably like trying to confide with you about something

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
that was troubling her at work.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
And you're like, she said a word that rhymed with claws,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
your Santa Claus.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
And you're like, oh, oh, oh.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Like...

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
And she's like...

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
This is not based on any true events at all.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
This is completely made up.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
That is not true.

33:36.000 --> 33:45.000
I've been doing toothpaste Santa Claus for 20 plus years.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
I need a new bit.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
Does toothpaste work on cotton balls?

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
For glue, yeah.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
If you're strapped.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
So that wasn't a riff that Dan actually knows that you do that.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
I've done it a couple of times.

34:03.000 --> 34:10.000
I did it last Christmas.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.000
I woke Kate up Christmas morning

34:16.000 --> 34:22.000
with a red shirt and white tape down my cotton all over my face

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
and two oven mitts.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Oh, Mary.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Jesus Christ.

34:30.000 --> 34:40.000
What is this minty, fresh elf doing in here?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I thought that gave you joy.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
I didn't realize it pissed you off.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Let's go down memory lane.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Do you guys remember the very first time you met

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
and what the interaction was?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
You and Schrab?

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I remember...

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Someone says I know it.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Someone knows.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
You do?

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Okay.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
What do you fucking know?

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
I remember the very first time I saw you two.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.000
I noticed Schrab after a comedy sports workshop

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
and he was wearing his fucking leather baseball cap

35:15.000 --> 35:23.000
and his gray sweatshirt.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
We were having vice beers with Bo Johnson

35:28.000 --> 35:35.000
after the workshop and then Schrab was talking about...

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
He's eating Fritos and drinking beer

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
and he said something like,

35:40.000 --> 35:46.000
you know, they put riboflavin in these chips.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
You guys hear this?

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
They put riboflavin.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
They put meat tenderizer

35:54.000 --> 36:00.000
and it makes you thirsty for some chemical in Coke.

36:00.000 --> 36:06.000
So if you eat Fritos, you get tenderized

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
and then you want Coke

36:08.000 --> 36:13.000
and then the Coke makes you want Fritos.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
This is the first interaction?

36:15.000 --> 36:20.000
That's the first time I was like, who the fuck is this?

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
But were you both on Milwaukee Comedy Sports this time?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
No, we were students.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
We were in high school.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
We were aspiring.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
We were aspirants to that throne.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
And you were not in high school?

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Were you already on the squad, Rob?

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
No, no, I was in workshops.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
But I was in my last year of college.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Had you both just moved to Milwaukee?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Were you still in Red Deer or Brown River?

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
That was like my fourth year in Milwaukee.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
I was probably in between living with my parents in Brown Deer

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
and living with McKenna on the east side of Milwaukee.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Well, that's not true because I wouldn't be living with McKenna.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
So I was probably just pretty much living with my parents

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
and crashing on people's couches in Milwaukee.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
Did you and Rob connect that first day or did it take a while?

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I think it took a while.

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
I think we're still trying to connect.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
No, I think we connected.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
We did all right.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Who cares?

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
There's a question for the ages.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Who cares?

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Rob does.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
I do.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
You do too.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
He pretends like he doesn't.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
That's his shield.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
How important is your friendship to Rob's job?

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
Yeah, it's worth like a billion dollars.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
It's worth its weight in gold.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Wait, so you put it into financial terms?

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
Well, when you see Rob, you see just a giant bag of cash.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
No, no, I said what's worth to him.

37:51.000 --> 37:57.000
No, to you, like emotionally.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
Oh, it's worth a thousand hugs.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Not a billion dollars, just a thousand hugs.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
I don't measure.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I don't see things through that lens.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
What is the hug to dollar conversion?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Nine.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
That's not bad.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
He made Rob leave the stage.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.000
It looks like he's floating ahead of floating head.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
He's like a green screen guy.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Why that expression?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
What's the expression?

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
He's shocked that his head is floating.

38:31.000 --> 38:37.000
You're shocked to be a floating head.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
Jeff's helping.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Quote unquote.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
But handing him something to hold with his hands

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
that aren't supposed to be there.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
Why did that help the illusion?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Put a sweater on him.

38:53.000 --> 38:59.000
Yeah, we can crop those out though.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
I don't have anything to talk about anyway, so.

39:01.000 --> 39:07.000
That's the thing.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
Just doing something behind the curtain.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
That's why you had to be behind the curtain.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
They shuffle back to their seats.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Someone really enjoyed that.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Was this big news here, too?

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
The 38 bodies found on that truck?

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
I read the headline, but it was not big news.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
It was just all over the TVs.

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
I usually don't see TVs unless I'm in airports.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
We kept debating.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Cody's like, what's a lorry?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
It's a bus.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Maybe it's a truck, too.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
But it was like 38 bodies found on a lorry.

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
This is a great time for Rob to be making light of things.

39:56.000 --> 40:03.000
Just a truck full of dead people.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
Obviously, a human trafficking thing.

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
Of course, human trafficking being a really horrible...

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
One of the worst atrocities in modern times.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
Many lives claim, say, every hour, two women are...

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
It's probably...

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
Why are you applauding this?

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
Usually dealing with some of the most vulnerable segments of our population.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
Yeah, there's probably more slaves living today,

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
active slaves than there have been at any point in history.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
Oh, so now it's not funny.

40:41.000 --> 40:46.000
Now that there's not a candle, no one cares.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
Here's something I think you'll find interesting.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Okay, lay it on me.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
We're driving from the Oslo Airport to Frederikstad.

40:56.000 --> 41:02.000
And our driver, Odvar,

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
we said to him, you know, because it's Halloween at the time,

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
we were like, do you guys celebrate Halloween in Norway?

41:09.000 --> 41:17.000
And he said, we actually just started recently, about two years ago.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
How does that happen?

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
What kind of fucking...

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Who was that?

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Halloween just moved in?

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
Are there any foreign holidays that we could start doing?

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Yeah, I know.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
You guys ever heard of Sweetest Day?

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Yeah.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
The guy who knows how tan bench, Rob knows about it.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Sweetest Day.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Sweetest Day.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
Sweetest Day is a holiday that's celebrated in the Midwest.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I remember hearing about it.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
It's just made up.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
It's one of these made up holidays.

41:51.000 --> 41:58.000
Oh, no, most of the holidays are natural laws passed down by the gods.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
No, but it was just, it's called Sweetest Day to sell candy.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
It was conceived of by confectioners.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
The first day is the sweetest.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Whoa.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Thank you.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
I wrote down this note.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
I don't care if you don't laugh.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
That was funny for me.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I wrote down, why am I always losing everything?

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
Because I thought I left my, because I did leave, I left my boarding pass from the, on

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
the connecting flight on the plane.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
No big deal.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
I was able to just get another one.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
It's just a boarding pass, like you're in the airport anyway, but like, I was like,

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
I was like, God damn, it's like obviously something that I wouldn't choose to leave.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
And I'm always doing that.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
I'm always like leaving shit, you know, no matter how important it is.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.000
And then on the next flight, on the one to Oslo, I was convinced I couldn't find my

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
AirPods earbuds.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
What the fuck are they called?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
AirPods?

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
Jesus Christ, Apple, get your shit together.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
They're coming out with the AirPod Pro.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Oh, cool.

42:53.000 --> 43:01.000
I hope I can use those with my iPad 7th generation non-pro with second type of Apple pencil mini

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
air.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Fucking idiot.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
What the fuck?

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Steve Jobs body isn't even cold.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
They turned him to fucking Microsoft.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Fucking idiots.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
That Tim Apple's fucking everything up.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
You'd think.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
Tim Apple.

43:15.000 --> 43:22.000
You'd think with a name like that, he'd like be ready for the job.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
But I wrote this down.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Yeah.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
This very lugubrious.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Why am I always losing everything?

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
And when I look at it, I remember how I felt.

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
Fuck man.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Keep going.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Keep going.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
Do you want to talk about slavery real quick?

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Sex trafficking.

43:42.000 --> 43:48.000
I don't even like using the word pimp anymore because the proper term is sex trafficker.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Is that right?

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Yeah.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
That's what pimp stands for.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
No.

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
But it's like a sanitized version of what's actually happening.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
But I wrote down why am I always losing everything?

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
Because the reason I wrote it down is because I was really genuinely in the throes of this

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
sort of tailspin, just because I lost this stupid Apple product.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
And then I was like, it wasn't like that was valuable to me.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
It was this idea of like, it's the ego hit.

44:18.000 --> 44:23.000
It was the fact that I could lose my boarding pass and then have that be such a center of attention.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
I'm so absent minded that I could leave my boarding pass on a plane and then got on another plane

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
and then left something even more valuable in spite of having every incentive.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
It sent me into such a depression because I was like, what is my fucking problem?

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
Well, you also had a load of shit in your pants.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
No, I didn't.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
This was the trip out there.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
That might have been a distracting factor.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
No, this was the trip out there.

44:45.000 --> 44:51.000
But then I found them in some pocket and it was like, oh, okay, I didn't lose my AirPods.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Did you look in the pocket?

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Shut up just for a second.

44:54.000 --> 45:00.000
And I was like, I don't know, there's something seemed profound about that because my mood was instantly lightened.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
I was like so depressed and so self-loathing.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
I was like, so you're such a piece of shit.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
There's something so wrong with you.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
And then I was like, I'm fine.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
I don't even know what to call that.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Do you have any pockets?

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Maybe you have too many pockets.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
That's not the issue.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
Obviously, there's something more we could be achieving here.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Let's audit your pockets, though.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
What?

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Let's audit his pockets.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
See how many we're working with.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
The closest thing to me that you're talking about is like when I break my phone,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
when I drop my phone and chatter the screen,

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
I feel so existentially destroyed.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
It's like, what are you?

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
You can't have nice things.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
Who the fuck do you think you are?

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
You know what?

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
I think when I drop my phone and broke the screen,

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
I think, oh, shit, I'm one of those people now.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Yeah.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Right.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Yeah.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
Before, every time I saw somebody with a broken screen,

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
I'd be like, come on, take care of your shit.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
And then crack.

46:08.000 --> 46:13.000
You got me again, God.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Hubris of man.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
I was really appreciating all the iPhone 11 launch day memes.

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
People were exchanging a lot of animated gifts of like Apple about to press that button

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
that makes your iPhone 10 turn to shit or whatever.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
And then there's like a guy like putting on lipstick in the mirror and going,

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
mm-hmm.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
It was a lot of fun.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
It's good when we can all get on the same page after a decade of servitude to a corporation.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
We're like, you know what?

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
I really do think they just push a button that makes like three generations of iPhone back.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Everything just goes to shit.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
They've got to be doing something, right?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I don't understand the meme.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
It doesn't matter.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
I'd like to understand the meme.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
Well, it's just it's just it doesn't matter what the meme is.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
The meme could be like a scene from fucking office space or something.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Who cares?

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
We got to be.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
We got to be.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
What?

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
What's with the button?

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
It breaks all the phones.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
We got to be.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
We got to be brainstorming in this Memoji space.

47:13.000 --> 47:18.000
There's a lot of there's a lot of untapped like creative space on these Memoji's that

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
we haven't figured out, but you know, we could be the first ones to get there.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
What's a Memoji?

47:23.000 --> 47:28.000
The Memoji is the animoji of your face that's built with your your facial features.

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
It's a combination of a bit Moji and I don't have that that new a phone.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
It's a very new space that we're very excited about.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Yeah, I saw.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
I've seen you in like in my group text Spencer doing your cute little Spencer.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
That's what I'm talking about.

47:43.000 --> 47:48.000
There's that's that's a whole new breed of content that someone's going to do like oh

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
I could put my baby up to this thing and she goes poopy diaper and it's an elephant saying

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
it and oh boy.

47:53.000 --> 47:58.000
But if we figure out what that is and tap that market people will be fucking will be

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
enshrined in the halls of Internet history will be the the new Viners.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
TikTok will pay deference to us.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
I don't know.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
That's the point.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
We got to stay current.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
I don't.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Well, first you have to understand.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
It was three days ago that someone told me what baby shark was and I was like, what

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
the fuck is going on?

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
And now like I'm like, well, let me catch you up.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
TikTok is a platform famous for paying deference.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Right.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Oh yeah.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
There's so reverent those teens.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
It's the differential treatment you get from TikTok is what you said.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
For you.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
You you text Jeff a lot.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Oh, I'm texting Jeff.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
I'm texting Dan.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I'm texting Steve.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
I'm texting Laura.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
I'm texting Zach.

48:47.000 --> 48:53.000
I'm texting Lolly, your dog.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
So I bought I bought this phone.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
I wrote one more emoji.

48:59.000 --> 49:04.000
I only got one more note in here, which is it was it was because Dina was making me think

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
because I was talking about how scared I am that like, I don't know, like I listen to

49:08.000 --> 49:15.000
so much true crime and then I like, I just feel like, you know, like the Mark David Chapman,

49:15.000 --> 49:22.000
like, like, like, like, like, we're getting crazier and crazier.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
And then our crazier people are going to get crazier and stuff.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
But then Dino always the contrarian.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
But sometimes that's helpful when you're in a tailspin.

49:29.000 --> 49:36.000
It was like, I don't know, maybe, maybe the internet's like, like a release for them.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
Like they don't have to like track you down and shoot you.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
They can fucking go on your Instagram and call you a fucking idiot.

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
And, you know, like, feel like they did something.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
That's an uplifting thought.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
These are all people that could shoot me.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
I should stop blocking them.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Yeah.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I'm cutting them off from.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Yeah.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
I mean, I should delete my Instagram.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Or should I?

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Or will that get me shot?

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
No, don't do that.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
What will you broadcast your workouts on?

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
When you meet somebody on Instagram, when you meet somebody, do they know that they've

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
been muted?

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Can they tell anybody?

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
I hope not.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
When you meet someone on what?

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Instagram.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
An Instagram.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
I don't know if there is.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
They don't post something and know that you don't give a fuck.

50:25.000 --> 50:34.000
And if you screenshot someone's story, do they know?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
That's an old Snapchat question.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
But I knew the answer to Snapchat.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
It's a fun question.

50:40.000 --> 50:46.000
Spencer, of those three books to your right, which is your favorite book of those three

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
books?

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Okay.

50:48.000 --> 50:55.000
So for the folks at home, the three books are Burt's Italian English and English Italian

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
Dictionary.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
All right.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
Spencer, pick a title that speaks out to you, the one that you like the most.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
Well, A Princess of Thule, or Tool, maybe?

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
Okay.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Tool.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
All right.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
So take that one.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
Okay, man.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Is this a magic trick?

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
No, no, no, no.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Can I interject with something kind of fascinating here?

51:12.000 --> 51:15.720
Because there were three books, and he picked A Princess of Thule, which means that one

51:15.720 --> 51:19.880
of those books, which is way thinner than the other, is either an Italian to English

51:19.880 --> 51:23.000
or a English to Italian, and one's way thicker.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Right.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
I'm just wondering which language is pitching and which is catching here.

51:28.000 --> 51:33.000
No, the other book is Gallery Buffet Soup Cookbook.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
Okay.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Oh.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
All right.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Is that a tool?

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Yeah.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
How many titles do these three books have?

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
Okay.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
I'm realizing that one of these books is just both.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
The dictionary is both ways.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
Oh, okay.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
Here's something my friend Jenny Mack from Texas taught me.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
Oh, I know.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
I met her.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Oh, yeah, you met Jenny.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
I met her there.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
You met her in Austin.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
I know something.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
All right.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
Now, you have this book.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
Ask yourself kind of a philosophical question about yourself, like not like...

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Oh, boy.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
Ask yourself something about you, your future, your life, what you want, what you don't want,

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
what you want to know about yourself.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Ask yourself that question, but don't tell anybody.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
Yeah, I did.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
How many pages are in this book, Spencer?

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Oh, boy.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
462.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Okay.

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
Pick a number between 10 and 460, and you pick that number first.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Me personally?

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
You pick the number.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Okay.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
You got it?

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
No.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
I got it.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
Okay.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
69.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
69.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
You know, it's funny.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
It's that one.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
Because that's when people are looking at something.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Or doing things.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Yeah, okay.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
At the same time, though, that's why it's funny.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
Ideally...

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
If one person's doing it at the other person, that's serious shit.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
Nobody wins.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
This guy's eating my pussy.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Okay, so you've chosen...

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Or I'm sucking this guy's dick.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
No, I think it's different.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
At the same time.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Woo-hoo!

53:01.000 --> 53:06.000
So you've chosen page 69 out of the princess of Phil.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
No, I'd pick the different number.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
Okay, what is it?

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
130.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
130.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
Now, let's say...

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
How many lines of, like, of print or any page?

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
Diologue.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
Let's pick it up between 1 and 30.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Gay.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
I said gay, which is politically correct.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I thought you said gay.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
I think a lot of people might have.

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
People learned it out after five years of being woke.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
It's just erupting.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
Like, women shouldn't vote.

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
Unless, to be honest, maybe I said that.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
But that wasn't the intent.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Well, A, B, C, D, E, F, J, K.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
So, eight?

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
No, no, no.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
The number I picked was 15.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
15, okay.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Now, go to page 130, you said?

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Yep.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
We're almost...

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
You have the question in your mind, right?

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
You asked yourself.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Yes.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Now, go to that page.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
That line on that page is going to be the answer to that question.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I don't know if it's the one I want, though.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
Well, it's not up to you anymore, baby.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
It's up to...

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
Yeah, I mean...

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
William, you lady.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
Okay, so page 130, line what?

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
15 is what I said.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Line 15.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Okay.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Read the line out and then...

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Fill.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Fill.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Time.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
While I count the numbers.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Sorry, I could have done a lot better job communicating.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I thought you were reading the square.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
No, no, sorry.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
I'm so sorry.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Everybody, this is the house.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Count the lines.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
This is a song for that segment.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Yeah.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
14, 15.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Shush.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
No, that's what I wanted.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Wait, what was the line?

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
Is it a sentence or is it just a line of the page?

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Because, you know, a sentence can go multiple lines.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
Yeah, but read like a part of that sentence or whatever.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
It jumps out of you.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Okay.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
And in the evening too, when they had climbed to the top of the hills in the south of the

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
stormaway harbor, did not the little town look sufficiently picturesque with its white

55:04.000 --> 55:09.000
houses, its shipping, its castle and plantation lying in shadow under the green of the eastern

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
sky.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Then away to the west.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
What a strange picture presented itself.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
Thick bands of gray cloud lay across the sky.

55:16.000 --> 55:23.000
So you kind of get the idea.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
But now what was the now?

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
What was your?

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
What was your question?

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
I don't want to say.

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
But should I move to Portland?

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
Yeah, it definitely wasn't a clear answer.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Maybe it means Dan pick a book pick a book down.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
Yeah, well now I got six for you now that it's a tried and true parlor game.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I mean do you want this one or several rounds?

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
What book?

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
There are six books.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Is that the Italian?

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
No, these ones we didn't even name off.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
Okay.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Where's that book called then?

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
Well, this is what this might be fucked up.

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
This looks like a bunch of French or Latin or okay.

56:08.000 --> 56:15.000
It says Le Morte fight fight book that appeals to you by Sir Thomas Mallory.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
Hell yeah.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
I know that guy.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
Okay.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
Mallory never lets you down.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
What's the what's the first instruction?

56:21.000 --> 56:27.000
You ask yourself a philosophical question that you want to have the answer to.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
But don't reveal it to us yet.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
Right.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
Well, let me think about this first.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
Pick a good.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
It's kind of like Karnak.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
Can someone fill time?

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
I'm the scat man.

56:42.000 --> 56:50.000
Dole might is my name weekend.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
It's really fucking good.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
It's great.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
See people wrote Edward wrote the Dolomite bio pic.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Do you think they did better?

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
But kind of like his up and coming what they do was that better than I think

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Edward is like a perfect movie.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
This one's quite good though.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I thought Eddie Murphy did a great job.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
But Wesley Snipes was the fucking shit.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Okay.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
I got my.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
That's part of the movie.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Okay.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
Okay.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Good job, Rob.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
Filling time.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Dan has his philosophical question and the book is titled.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
What then?

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
A little more on the inside cover because it's very hard to read.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Fuck.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Hold on.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
Every man's library edited by Ernest rise.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
No, no.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
That might be the collection.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Okay.

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
Lamort D'Arthur, the death of Arthur, I assume.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Arthur's death.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
With an introduction by Professor rise in two volumes, volume one.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
This sounds good.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
Okay.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
I really knew what they were doing back then.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
Come on.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Just call it Skyfall.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
So pick a page in between like any page number.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
I don't know how long that book is.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
Okay.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
Wait.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
Sorry.

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
It's a page number that falls within the beginning and the end of that book.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
Should I flip to the page or just stick a finger in it?

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
No, no.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Think of a number.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Okay.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
Think of a number.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
Let me look at how many pages.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
It looks like four hundred and one.

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
So I pick a number between ten and ten in the intro or whatever.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
Okay.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
So I'll go with...

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Okay.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
I got it.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
You got it.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
What number?

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
69.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
69.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
It's funny.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
It's fucking funny.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Now pick a number between...

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Between one and let's say 24.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Because I think that's how many...

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
Let's ish the number of lines on the page.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
It's on it.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Okay.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
Pick a number between one and 24.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Ten.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
Okay.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Ten.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
So what page number?

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
69.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
69.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
Line ten.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
Okay.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
Now I want you to read us.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
Go to that page.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
Read us that line.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
And you have the question still in your head, correct?

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Yup, yup, yup.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
Okay.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
This is going to blow everybody's mind.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Spencer's was not so good.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
I think if we went with 69, it would have been a lot better.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
Let's go back to that after that.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
Okay.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
Wait, but did you ever tell us what your question was?

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
No, I didn't.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
I was embarrassed.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
Oh, okay.

59:10.000 --> 59:17.000
I mean, yeah, in your defense, I knew from watching you that I needed to pick...

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
I have philosophical questions that I don't want to share.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Right.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
And so I picked one that was worth sharing.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
Well, I'm glad to be, you know, take that bullet for you.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Yeah.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
That's cool.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
Okay.

59:29.000 --> 59:36.000
So 69, line 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Let's get it out.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Read that line all the way through.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Okay.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Well, it's kind of, it's in the middle of a...

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Yeah, that's what I had.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Then use the whole sentence then.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Okay.

59:46.000 --> 59:57.000
So, Balan prayed the lady of her gentleness for his true service that she would bury

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
them both in that same place where the battle was done.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I think that was my answer.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
So now, can you say the question?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:15.000
My question was, should I give death weight in my life?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Whoa.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Now, read the question again.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
No, no, read the line again.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I did get a death-related sentence.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
So Balan, this is some proper name.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I'm sure.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
It sounds like a dwarf, I think.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Sounds like it, yeah.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Prayed, and not, it's prayed like hands together, like talking to God.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000
So Balan prayed the lady of her gentleness, comma, which means, so he prayed the lady

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
of her gentleness.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Maybe that's a type of standardized prayer, maybe?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Say what?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
He saw it from her.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
He saw a prayer?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
He saw it from her.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Do you sound like you have an accent that means that you actually are credible in that?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Or are you just a foreign guy that's like, oh, no praying, you could pray on someone?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
No.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
We actually have Mallory right here.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Prayed the lady of her gentleness.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Is that a way to, I'm looking at.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Oh, he begged her for gentleness, maybe?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Can you pray someone of, would that be like beseeching them of their, beseeching their

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
gentleness?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Like asking, was soliciting it?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:34.500
So Balan prayed the lady of her gentleness, comma, for his true service, comma, that she

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:40.000
would bury them both in that same place where the battle was done.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
So, 9-11.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
9-11.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Ah.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Thessalonians 9-11.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Oh, fuck it, it's 9-11.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You actually is 9-11.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
But I could interpret that to mean like.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Way to go Mallory.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You know the phrase, don't shit where you eat?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Yeah.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.500
Like, you know, this is a character that is asking someone to bury him and someone else

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.600
that's important to him in the same place where they battled.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.700
So the answer to my philosophical question would be, well fuck yeah, give death weight

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:14.200
in your life.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.200
That's what life is.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:24.200
Like pick out your cemetery plot while you're alive, put your estate in order, write your

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:27.400
will, pick your funeral plot.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.000
That's not living outside the moment.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.640
That's praying to the goddess to bury you where the battle was fought.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.240
Put me right here when I drop unexpectedly.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.700
So the answer is yes, give it the amount of weight that it deserves, which is like, hey,

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:49.360
we were all here fighting it together and bury me on the battlefield.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.800
Don't bury me on the golf course.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:58.560
Is anybody here have a novel on them?

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.400
Is anybody here carrying a book that's like fiction?

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.400
I got five.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.400
You raising your hand?

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.400
Yeah.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400
Could we grab it?

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400
This is for you, Rob.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400
I don't want to play.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400
You got a...

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.800
I want to be buried on this stage.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.800
I don't want to play.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.560
Rob, you don't have to be afraid.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:18.000
The president can't read.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
It's fine now.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.520
Rob, I'll do all the work for you.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.520
This is a book.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.520
What's your name, sir?

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.520
Zach Butcher.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.520
Zach Butcher.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:33.920
That is a guy, and I agree with him, that loves his name.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:39.400
Because I always say Jeff when someone asks me my name, but if my full name was Zach Butcher,

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.600
I would never just say Zach.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600
Yeah.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600
That's for sure.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600
Yeah.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600
Okay.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.600
Because it would be like being named Chad Huge Dick.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.600
No, no, no.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.600
Chad Huge Dick is right.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.600
Chad Scientist.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.600
Yes, sir.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.600
Because you'd be like, Chad, wait for it.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.880
Okay, Rob, I'll do all the heavy lifting, Rob.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.600
All you have to do is ask yourself a philosophical question.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.600
Don't have any.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.000
It could be about you or Dan or me or anybody else.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I don't have any.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Yeah, you do.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I don't have any.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I don't even have any.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I don't have any.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I don't have any.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
You fucking do.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Yeah, you do.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It's about directing.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I don't, I don't really.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Rob, ask.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I don't want to be forced to play this.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Oh, come on.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I've been thinking just a minute.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Oh, brother.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
You love games.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
No, I don't.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
This guy loves his games.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
He's playing games right now.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I would never ask to be a part of this, and now I'm ruining the show.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
It's not a game if you can't lose.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Like, wait, wait.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Oh, he can lose.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I just want to watch.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I don't want to be.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.520
Why do I have to do it?

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.320
We'll just do a question.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.320
You don't have to do it, Rob.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.320
So if I say you pick a color, you won't pick a color

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.200
because someone's making you do something.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.120
It's like a game.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:51.820
Right?

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:55.320
You won't pick a color.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.720
Because there's always men on stage, who's a woman here

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.920
that wants a question answered in her life?

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.600
That's better.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.320
There's people.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:02.920
That's so much better.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.720
You can matter right here.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.240
What's your name?

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.240
Really?

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:05.720
Alicia.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.960
Welcome, Alicia, to the stage.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960
Alicia, come on up here.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:13.120
Thank you.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.320
Hello, Alicia.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.880
Grab a seat.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.040
All right, Alicia, are you ready to play this game?

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:19.720
I'm ready.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.800
OK, here's the deal.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.080
Hello.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.600
Hi.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.440
Wasn't it nice that you were asked

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.120
if you wanted to play this game?

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.600
That was pretty respectful.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.200
No.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.440
Pretty respectful.

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.760
Like, for the being forced on spotlight.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.840
The fucking prime minister of respect.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.200
And did you see this guy?

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.480
Got the robe.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.920
Did you see the movie, Alicia?

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.800
Oh, with Matt Damon?

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.600
Yeah.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.120
No.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.600
OK, it was bad.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.840
Was it Alicia?

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.560
No.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.240
Yeah.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.040
Oh, Alicia.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.600
No, no.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.600
It's Alicia.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.280
All right, Alicia.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.520
See?

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.680
You raised your hand because you want some sort

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.960
of philosophical question answered in your life.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.920
I'm seeking wisdom.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.160
That's within that book.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.600
Are we sure that microphone might not be on?

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.280
Let's turn this mic on with some applause.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.280
Is there a switch on?

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:12.780
Try it.

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:13.280
So.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.080
Is there a switch on?

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:15.600
Hello.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.680
There you go.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.240
It's the applause what did it.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.680
You got to eat that mic.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.880
You got to eat it like this.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:21.160
There you are.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.840
Well, she was eating it plenty, but it wasn't on.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.160
Not eating it.

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.640
OK, Alicia.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.240
This could be like a game show.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.440
Do you have the question ready in your mind?

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.640
Do you want to think about it for a moment?

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.560
I'm ready.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.440
You got it.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:32.720
Ready.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.440
All right, keep it to yourself for a second.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:38.880
This is a book that Zach Butcher gave us.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.120
And it is by the author Dan Simmons.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.400
And it's called The Rise of Endymion,

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.080
if I'm saying that correctly.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.960
Sure.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.640
I'm almost certain that Wootch was by one Zach Butcher.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.080
Someone fucking loves Endymion.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:52.920
I don't know if it was.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.720
I really don't know.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.960
It wasn't.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.840
Was it Zach Butcher or not?

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.560
No.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.280
OK.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.840
This book goes all the way to, let's call it, seven 108 pages

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.920
and starts around page five.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:09.480
So between five and seven 108, pick a number.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:09.920
You got it?

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.680
Got it.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:15.120
And now tell me the number.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.640
We'll go 666.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.440
Oh, dang.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.240
That's funny too.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.080
That's like the 69 of the occult.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.280
Hell yeah.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:23.880
Accurate, Dan.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:29.600
That's like if the devil was eating leprechaun's pussy

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:33.040
well, the leprechaun fucking ate his ass.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.120
A goblin.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:35.320
That's what it means.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:35.920
It's fun.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.240
And if they did it on 420.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.520
Yep.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.280
The hijink.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.760
So from The Rise of Endymion, am I saying that correctly?

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.240
Zach Butcher?

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.960
Endymion.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.760
There's got to be at least 30 lines or more.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.880
Pick a line on the page.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.640
27.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.680
Oh.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.080
That's going to take a while to get there.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.680
Everybody says that the Scatman stutters,

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:04.400
but doesn't ever stutter when he sings.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.520
Watch it out.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.640
I'm going to tell you, the stutter and the scat

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.800
is the same for you.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.880
I'm the Scatman.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.200
I'm the Scatman.

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.160
I used to love the Scatman.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.320
OK, so Alicia.

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:22.960
Yes, Jeff.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.400
Is it A-L-I-C-I-A?

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.040
E-L-Y-S-I-A.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:27.720
Like the movie.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.280
Like the movie.

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:28.800
Like the Lyceum.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.480
That is correct.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.320
Oh, Lyceum.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.640
Well, from Endymion.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.280
Here we go.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.800
So you have a question in your mind.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.360
Show me that text.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.200
I have my question.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.600
You chose in line 27, page 666 from Dan Simmons,

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:40.800
The Rise of Endymions.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.200
And then it goes like this, Rob.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.400
And then I remembered that the one reason to be free,

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.760
the one person who would make such freedom worthwhile,

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.520
was gone.

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.320
Shit.

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.080
Holy shit.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.000
Holy shit.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.120
And the question was?

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.880
Should we relocate our life from California

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.640
to another part of the country?

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.680
And you would because it was gone, right?

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.200
It was gone to the other side of the country.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.480
It kind of sounds like I'm alone if I do this.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.440
Yeah, right.

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:19.960
That's true.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.200
But the one reason to be free,

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.040
the one person who would make such freedom worthwhile.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.080
My husband.

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.200
Oh, shit.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:26.880
Oh, no.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.160
We just killed your husband.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.120
That's the albino, you know.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.800
Is your husband the famous albino?

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.280
I guess.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:33.840
Yeah.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.160
That's not how it works.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.920
But we're not leaving her going home,

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:37.600
empty-handed.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.800
Well, you could interpret it as a.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.640
Alicia.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640
You get this novel.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.520
Station Plague.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:48.120
You get Zach Butcher's copy of Dan Simmons, The Rise of Endymions.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.480
Thank you, Zach Butcher.

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.000
Along with two ice cubes.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.440
Sorry, Zach.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.360
She's got your fucking book now.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.160
No, they're not.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.720
They're actually quite comfortable.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.760
Thank you, Alicia.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.880
Let's give it up for Alicia.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.920
Thank you so much, madam.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.880
If I was thinking about whether to change locations

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.400
with my partner, and then that was the answer,

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.760
as cloudy as it is, I would focus on the idea

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.800
that what that passage is saying is,

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:20.160
as unsatisfying as the answer might be,

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:27.080
you relocate or don't just stick with this person.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:30.040
Just make sure it's what you both want to do.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.600
Because as long as you're with him,

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.760
you can't pick a wrong place.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.760
Right.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.240
Oh, yeah.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:44.120
Unless it's a very sunny place, because he'll get skin cancer.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:53.280
Hell, yeah.

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.680
More like the walk of fame, you know what I'm saying?

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.400
Hell, yeah.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.120
I had a dream the other night where

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.480
I kept pulling pine needles and pine branches out of my mouth.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.600
Like, I ate a fucking Christmas tree.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.920
And then last night, I had a dream

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.200
where I kept pulling glass shards out of my mouth.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.760
Like, my teeth were punched crystals.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.400
I had a dream last night.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.240
I was going to the bathroom.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.640
I was peeing, standing up.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.880
That was no dream.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:23.720
And there were like bullet holes in the toilet.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.120
And I was like, where are all these bullet holes doing

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:26.840
in the toilet?

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.480
And a guy came in and shot me.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.760
And as I was dying in the dream, I said,

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.680
why don't I just jump out the window?

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:40.520
I woke up.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.320
I just remembered a crazy dream

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:47.720
I had on one of the flights, which was, yeah,

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.960
it was a fucking insane, like super vivid, weird.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:57.040
There were these dolls.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.600
I was trying to construct.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:04.000
And when they were completed, they

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.480
had the ability to generate these portals out of their face

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.800
that were like these hula hoops in space

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.720
that would like come out of their mouths

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.040
and then be in space in front of them.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.880
And if you put your head through the hula hoop,

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.560
you were like in a different world.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.720
And it was really freaky.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.440
And I started to realize all too late

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:35.960
that the dolls were part of some race of things

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.200
that wanted me to finish the dolls

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.800
so that they could take over.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:44.120
And some kind of thing of a gateway to break up

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.120
Morty season five.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.520
I just remember running from them with Cody.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.440
And then there was these guys that

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.720
were agents of these dolls or something.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.480
That's so fucking cool.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.000
When you dream a lot, is Cody usually there?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.240
Cody's in my dreams a lot.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.200
But I really typically do not.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.240
I mean, when people say you dream for sure every night,

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.520
but then there's a question of what you remember.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.680
But let's just say, if remembering your dreams

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.680
is what we call dreaming, I really don't have,

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.760
I don't really don't dream a lot.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.720
But when I do, I have these super vivid dreams.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.520
I shared on this podcast this crazy dream

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.880
I had that was where it was literally dreaming

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.360
within dreaming and in the dream waking up.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.840
And I talked about that here.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.880
And it was in a different house.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.160
But it was also a new house that I was sharing with Cody

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.520
that was also unfurnished.

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.840
And then in the dream, the scary shit happened

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.240
as I heard a noise and walked out of there,

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.400
some scary shit happened.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:48.400
And then in the dream, which I did not know was a dream,

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.600
I fucking woke up in bed with Cody in a new house.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:14:00.240
And just in the movies when they do these mislead dreams,

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.400
it was like, Cody was like, are you all right?

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.560
And I was like, yeah, I just had this crazy nightmare.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.920
Talked to her about it, started laying back down.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.960
Heard a noise and walked and explored it.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:17.320
And then I fucking woke up in what I assume is real life.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.080
But now can never really know.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.680
It may as well not be.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.080
Because what are the rules here?

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.960
This could be a fucking dream.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.600
Do your dogs ever dream?

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.560
Do you ever catch your dogs dreaming?

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.120
Oh, yeah.

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.640
Nigel is like, Nigel does not sleep without it at some point.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.960
And I go, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.520
I always like, butoring between.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.160
You look at a dog, they sound distressed when they're

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.400
making noises in their sleep.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.320
But then again, you're kind of like,

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.200
how would you know if a dog was having the time of their life

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.360
in a dream?

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.120
Because my instinct is like, let them know it's OK.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:55.960
Wake them up.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.200
Like, hey, it's all right.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.600
Because you assume that they're running from something

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.120
in their dream.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.160
But what if they're chasing something?

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.760
Those are the two modes of dog, right?

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.760
Yeah.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.760
Like, you don't want to take that away from them

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:12.160
if they're about to catch an ostrich with a fire hydrant

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.080
for a head or whatever.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:13.840
Gary Larson.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.360
Yeah, what do they dream about?

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.200
Do they dream about taking a nap?

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.280
I mean, what do they do all day?

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.920
Remember that Gary Larson cartoon where the dog is dreaming

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.800
and the dog is on top of an overturned car?

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.800
And he's like howling in victory.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.800
He caught a car.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:38.680
And in that Gary Larson book, the Farside Natural History

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.560
book, he goes into all this detail

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.800
about how it's just a whole section about times

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.840
his cartoons that caused an uproar.

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.200
And that was one of them.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.440
Because the way he drew it, there's

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:53.200
just a certain percentage of people saw that cartoon

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.800
and thought the dog was fucking the car.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.480
And he's just like, I mean, there's

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.360
a part of the car that, I guess, is

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.440
like tangential to the dog's pelvis.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.000
But it's like, why would the car have a vagina?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.440
Why would they think that the dog, that the reason dogs chase

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.200
cars?

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.360
And why would they think those people woke up in a world

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:23.960
where, lest they're vigilant enough,

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.640
the guy who created the Farside might just every once

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.200
in a while on Sunday morning treat your family

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.840
to an image of a dog fucking a car.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:39.280
Unless you, Joe Q. Citizen, are on your shit

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.760
with your pen ready to go and your stamps ready to lick

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.320
to the local paper, that's what.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.800
Do you remember the beef that he got?

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.000
Remember cow tools?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.720
There was a cow with like a blacksmith's apron on.

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.120
And a cow standing upright on two legs.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.080
And it was standing in front of like a table.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:02.240
And there was this really weird kind of oblong,

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.680
misshapen, like, you don't know what they are.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.200
And it's just like four or three things.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.360
And I said, cow tools.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.840
And people were all fucked off about that.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.000
Because they didn't get it.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:13.800
They didn't like it.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:14.760
They were mad about it.

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.200
And he had to write it or try it.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.160
He goes, cows don't make good tools.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.360
But they thought, didn't they think like they were like dildos

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.640
and stuff or something?

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.000
People, it was inflammatory.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:25.960
It was really good.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.160
It's funny, I said like dumb people.

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.240
They live in this world, like this beautiful world,

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:35.360
where like they're the only smart ones.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.360
And they're the only ones that care.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.480
But it's the opposite.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.880
They're the only ones that don't care.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.120
And they don't know anything.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.120
So they really get on the freeway.

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.440
They're just like, bleh, bleh.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.560
And everyone's like, bleh, bleh.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.880
And they're like, you idiots.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.320
And then they just see something that offends them

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.320
if they don't get the joke.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.520
And they're like, instead of saying, I don't get it,

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.320
they're just like, that's a terrible joke.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.120
What do you mean?

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.760
You're going to fuck that guy.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.040
I really feel like the hate mail that Gary Larson got

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.880
for Couchells was like people thought they took personal

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.520
offense to it.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.520
And I don't know what that's based on.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.960
Because it's just a drawing or something

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.800
that looks like kind of like a baby's rattle

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.560
with a little thing on it.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.040
Yeah.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.920
It just like, it's really.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:14.720
I just looked at it.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.400
It was really good.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.840
There's like a saw that looks like it's made out of brand

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:21.600
or something.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.880
It's the funniest joke about that.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.840
It's really funny.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.680
I love bad jokes, but there's certain jokes

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:31.080
that you can only tell people that like anti-humor.

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:34.440
And that's a really anti-joke joke.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.720
Like the guy who's half his head's a pumpkin.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.240
That's a joke that people only laugh at if you like comedy.

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.800
And also know that the rules can be broken

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.800
for the sake of comedy.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.080
Yeah.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.640
I think we talked about that book before on this podcast.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.680
But what are you going to do to cancel me?

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.560
There's five episodes left.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.760
But the other section of that book that's great

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.760
is the handful of times that for some reason,

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.200
whenever there was a mistake, it would

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.920
be the Far Side's captions getting

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.680
swapped with the family circus.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.160
Yeah.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.400
It's so like Billy's walking up to his mom

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.000
and saying what a caveman fortune teller is

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.920
supposed to be saying to a caveman, which is Billy looking up

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.360
at his mom and saying, I see your skull on a shelf

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.600
in an anthropologist's office.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.880
That really happened?

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.400
Yeah.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.960
Oh, awesome.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.840
Family circus is a fucking freak out.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.840
When I used to work at Disneyland doing a sketch show,

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.280
or I used to play a drag character in Frontierland,

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.440
we would take Family Circus every day

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.440
and then tear off the caption and then write our own caption.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.760
And it was the funniest thing in the world.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.280
It's always funnier because nothing

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:50.160
happens in Family Circus except just oblique sadness.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.240
That was my first time taking acid

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.800
when the acid chip was winding down, which is also

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.240
those sometimes when you get really punchy.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.160
Acid could be more like, oh my god, whoa, yeah.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.200
And not totally like giggles and stuff,

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.680
but then as the acid tapers off.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:09.040
As I remember in my youth, I haven't done a ton of acid

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.920
except in my youth, but it tapers off

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:15.520
into a kind of almost mushroomy kind of giggly thing.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.440
And I just remember the sun coming through the windows

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.840
and listening to music.

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.120
And for some reason, I had this giant stack

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.920
of Milwaukee journals.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.240
And we were just going through every Family Circus on acid

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.480
looking at every single one.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.680
I'd be like, wait, it was insane.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.640
That cartoon is really insane if you're on acid.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.960
What's this dolled line doing, man?

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.280
Why do we care where this kid has been?

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:47.680
How many goddamn times are they going to take this big Family

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.080
Circus and they show you where the kid was all day?

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.680
Oh, man, he went over the fence twice.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.920
The little kid was named Jeffrey.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.320
So people would always send me things saying like,

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.280
Jeffrey totaled.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:00.520
There's one, it's so fucking abstract and like, it's not funny.

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:05.000
I don't know the point of view, like what the fuck is going on.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.800
And mommy, Jeffrey totaled his tricycle.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.600
And it was Jeffrey crying with a tricycle on its side.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.760
Because apparently, like, totaling your car

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.760
was a new phrase back in 1978.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:20.000
So it was kind of like, yeah.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.840
Yeah, and it's like, oh, that's, I don't get it.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:28.640
But I thought Garfield was good and funny, but guess what?

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.480
Nope.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.560
You were wrong.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.520
Yeah, I'm in that boat, yeah.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.080
I mean, I had Garfield notebooks, backpacks.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.040
I was like, Garfield's the best.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.960
And then you look back and you're like, what happened there?

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.120
It was like the war on drugs.

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.920
We just all bought it.

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:47.400
This cat's so fat.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.200
At the age of seven years old, I never considered

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:54.000
whether or not I would or would not do Mondays.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.480
I guess it was just like we hadn't seen a cat portrayed

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:07.560
as so selfishly like no cats could be so solipsistic.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.760
Go back to the annals of Garfield and watch his feet grow.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.840
Because by the end of the current Garfield,

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:19.680
his feet are like 42 inches long.

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.600
And he has parts of a cat that cats don't have.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.640
It's all fucked up.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.480
Parts that a cat doesn't have?

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:31.440
Yeah, but he has like a flimbus.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.720
I don't know, eyebrows?

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.440
I don't know.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.040
It's a shitty drawing of a cat.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.880
Snoopy doesn't look much like a dog,

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.080
but he's still recognizable as a dog.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.720
Snoopy looks like an abomination.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.720
Charlie Brown doesn't look like a human being.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.360
Charlie Brown looks like a member of Congress.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:52.040
Like he is a...

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:53.920
God damn it, I bought a spider house.

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.720
I suppose we were fucking spiders in my house.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.280
What is going on?

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.880
It got away, Cody, send me a picture of this giant spider.

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:02.800
Why are we away?

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.440
I hope we dropped the ad in there.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.880
Yeah, we got to put the ad there.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.200
Dettelbell Kitchen.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.400
I said, did you kill it?

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.880
She said, it got away.

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:13.840
It ran.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.600
Now it knows.

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:18.120
Now it knows what you look like and your intentions.

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.880
It's teaching itself how to learn, Dan.

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.400
I smashed it a little so it's possible injured,

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.680
but it's gone.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:31.280
If you can smash a spider and it runs away...

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:31.960
That happened.

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.720
I told you about the spider that pulled out of my ear

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.840
and I stepped on it as hard as I could.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:38.960
And the spider went, whew, and ran boned out.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.840
Stepping on spiders is not a good plan.

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.280
Like spiders don't give a shit about your foot,

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:45.600
but they don't care about mass and energy.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.920
I tried to smoke it out from under the nightstand

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.800
with Palo Santo.

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.240
Hell yeah.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.080
They like that.

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.920
What a valley girl.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.080
She tried to smoke it out from under the nightstand.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.600
I...

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.680
There's all these mosquitoes.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:04.920
So you know there's this new breed of mosquito in LA

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.760
that only needs a teacup of water to have a million babies

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.440
and they're smart and they only bite your ankles

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.880
because they understand.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.440
These things are all over my house.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.760
You know about these new mosquitoes?

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.360
No, what about the new mosquitoes?

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.360
You still fucked off when we tried to make you look

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.560
at a book or something like that.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.800
But so quiet you've just been fuming over there.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:26.280
What?

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:30.160
The last thing you said was red.

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.160
I think it's just like sitting there like, I'm gonna fucking

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:35.360
kill you and you're asleep.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.280
You know the thing with those new mosquitoes?

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.840
I was listening to the Garfield story.

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.520
Every time the new mosquitoes come out,

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.520
the old ones stop working.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.120
The old ones stop working.

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:52.280
We'll be right back.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.920
Welcome back to Harmontown.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.520
Did they really turn off old phones?

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.440
I don't know.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.360
They stopped working.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.680
Obviously, they won't admit it.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.480
But it just seems uncanny when the new phones are coming out.

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:06.160
Doesn't your old shit start getting all glitchy?

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.680
They did find some sort of thing.

01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:09.520
Like, it's not.

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.600
I don't think it was pronounced.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.640
They said they did.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.880
Because every time there's a new iPhone, my speaker,

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.720
I can't hear.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.880
Like, it instantly goes out.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.840
That's just age.

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:19.840
That's just age.

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:32.320
I've got more Garfield stories.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.640
That guy used to look different than he does now.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:39.240
He used to be like a big, fat, weird thing.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:44.600
When they started leasing phones, I was like, come on, man.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.960
That's my hot take.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.720
The thing I'm going to miss most about Harmontown

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:55.880
is the trenchant commentary on social life like that.

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:59.640
I like the hand gesture that the listeners at home won't see.

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:00.600
So many fucking spiders.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.480
They should have called it spider house.

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.480
Because there's one spider house?

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:11.960
Do you have $3 million and no spiders?

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.120
Let us solve both of your problems.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:17.240
Have $0 and 3 million spiders.

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.920
Hi, I'm Bob Spider.

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:19.920
Realtor.

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:28.280
Do you want the convenience of living in a spider's nest

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:31.400
without having to be a spider?

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:36.680
Come on down to this fucking hacienda.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.760
How many spiders have you seen?

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.720
At least six.

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.320
How many rooms do you have?

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.760
At least seven.

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.080
You know, I've seen a bunch of seven rooms.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.520
I've been cruising around that house since before Furniture One

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.040
showed up.

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.320
And there's just been, I clocked at least 20, 30 spiders

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.600
in the back of those times.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:58.960
And these are probably new spiders.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.000
This is probably generation six or seven.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.240
And while we're complaining about stuff,

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:10.320
my old house in Los Feliz, I went over there recently.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.160
There's rat turds all over the basement.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:13.960
Oh, shit.

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:14.480
Yeah.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.200
Literally.

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.800
Because I went over there to throw out my sex doll.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.600
And they were fucking like, that basement

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.320
has been a party for so many years.

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.320
You still have the real doll from way back.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.720
No, he threw it out.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:28.960
Not anymore, brother.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.840
But you bought that a long, long time ago.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.640
Yeah.

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.520
How did you dispose of that, just in a dumpster or what?

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.280
Called Levy.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.840
You want to ask Levy what he did?

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.560
Do you want to ask him?

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.680
Let's bring out Steve Levy to find out the answer to that

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.180
question.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.000
Hello.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.640
Thanks, everybody.

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.240
Oh, remember last episode, we were talking about your quote,

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.480
unquote, Jewfro.

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.680
Yeah, that's a way.

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.240
Self-applied.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.040
I wouldn't be so anti-Semitic.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.480
Yeah, no, no, yeah.

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.840
I said that a regular fro.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.400
You applied your Jewfro?

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.640
I applied for a Jewfro.

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:23.000
Let me know how I go.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.200
Those are on backwards.

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.480
You look a little bit like A-Rod now.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.280
Yeah, that's true.

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.760
He's roiding, too.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.720
Are you roiding?

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.360
I didn't ask for this.

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:36.280
I kind of just go to a guy, and he just goes, you know?

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:38.560
But it's just like, all right.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.240
I'm just like, yeah, just make it shorter.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.480
And then it's like, every time it's

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.200
a different work of art for him, he's a hair artist.

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:45.760
I don't know.

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.400
That's what he considers himself, right?

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.480
Sure.

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:51.360
But I saw Waldron this morning, and he was like,

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.720
nice Richard Spencer.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:56.560
And I was like, fuck, fuck Richard Spencer.

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:57.760
I mean, what does he look like?

01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.720
He just looks like something like me.

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.920
Apparently, he's got a haircut like this.

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.160
Well, I mean, you know.

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.400
Look.

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.960
Anyway, well, all right, so I leave

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:13.760
he's no longer my assistant, he's now an executive, my executive.

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.840
Yeah.

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:22.400
But my new assistant, I'm not going to ask her to throw away

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.440
a box the size of a child's coffin.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.400
She couldn't lift it.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.480
With Chinese lettering and Dan Harmon written on it

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:31.560
and magic marker.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.560
She wouldn't be able to lift it.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.440
Well, yeah, she'd have to hire some people that I was like,

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.280
she'd have to hire Steve.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:37.840
This is crazy.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.720
Like, how do you get rid of one of these fucking things?

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:40.640
I've never thought.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.200
I called a morgue.

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.320
Was this the original doll that you bought a long time ago?

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:48.040
He'll figure it out eventually.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.600
Was this doll number one?

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.160
Or did you die from having a metal skeleton inside of her?

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:56.960
It was a second doll.

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:58.040
There was a second doll.

01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.080
On the grassy knoll.

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:09.000
So I texted Levy.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.360
Well, we made a deal.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.240
Right, because you were like, oh, they

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.320
need you to come back for a record

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.840
before the screening of this.

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:18.360
And I'm like, I'm over here up to my knees.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.160
For those of you who don't know, we've

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.480
been talking a lot about all of our celebrities that

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:24.000
are voicing characters on Rick and Morty.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.480
But really, you're the new Ryan Ridley

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.440
in terms of voice.

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:32.520
You're a lot of really funny characters.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:36.360
You guys will see Dan Harmon, great voice actors.

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.240
Some of the funny characters that you'll

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.800
be seeing on Rick and Morty, but mostly hearing are.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.800
Have you heard Mr. Egg?

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.360
Dan, I heard that you do Captain Yeast.

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.480
You do Harvey Fierstein.

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:52.160
They're all student-related.

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.960
Can we hear your Harvey Fierstein

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:55.440
that you're doing on season?

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.520
Harvey Fierstein theme.

01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.440
Sorry, sorry.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:00.240
OK, Captain, yeah, we made this.

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:02.840
We need you to come in to record some of your characters.

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.960
Right, so you needed me, and I was

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.080
in the middle of moving stuff, and I'm like, all right,

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.160
look, I'll make you a deal.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:13.360
Because I had just finished wrapping this greasy box up

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.920
and was like, how am I going to fucking,

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.120
what do you do with this thing?

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.800
Everyone has one friend with a pickup,

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.160
and maybe knows where a dump is.

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.320
I've led a privileged life, and I just

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:28.400
have this body in a box.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.400
It really, it's like 200 pounds.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:36.240
Yeah, because the skeleton is titanium on these things.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.160
They got a recycled machine.

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:42.280
So I just kind of wrapped it up in two layers of plastic bag,

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.840
the box, and wrapped duct tape all around it,

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.080
and then I texted Livia a photo of it

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.320
and stayed on my bedroom floor.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.320
I was like, if you come over here,

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:53.040
and this thing is gone when I get back,

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.720
then I'll go to work right now.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.440
And he's like, deal, I'm on my way.

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:01.800
And I was like, it's like an old political thriller.

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.600
You literally know where the bodies are buried.

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:06.080
It was quid pro quo.

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:06.720
Yeah.

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:08.760
Where did you take it, Livia?

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.080
So I.

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.360
And who'd you call?

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get there.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.160
Yay.

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:20.160
So I went up to Dan's bedroom, assessed this giant box.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.040
I brought tape and a Sharpie of my own, just in case you didn't.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.040
You weren't able to cover up.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.800
Cross out the name Dan Harmon.

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:27.920
Yeah, yeah, box.

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.840
I don't know what you have at your house or whatever.

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:34.080
So it is a really heavy box.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:36.920
I know it.

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.360
It was probably telling me.

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:43.480
It was probably between 80 and 115 pounds.

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:44.600
No, it's over 100.

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:45.640
It's got to be.

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.600
Well, I lifted the whole thing.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:50.800
It really glimpsed into the life of a serial killer,

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.960
because we've joked about it in my youth with my fetishes

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.200
and things and me getting mannequin legs and things

01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:56.700
like that.

01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:59.400
But these are just hollow plastic things.

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:06.280
But this body, and the idea of getting rid of it,

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:09.720
and the whole thing being this needs to go away,

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.800
as opposed to this thing is a thing

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.320
that you can have and just store it somewhere.

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.240
But it's the idea of this needs to go away,

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:19.520
and no one needs to ever find it.

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.080
It was this introduction in my head.

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.880
I was sort of like, God, can you imagine

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:28.000
if it was also rotting and was an actual crime instead

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.880
of just a thing that could ruin your life

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.120
and make everyone laugh at you?

01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:35.080
But it was sort of like minus the fact

01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:38.480
that it's actually heavier than an equal-sized body would be.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.640
It was just such a weird glimpse into that world.

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:46.920
Isn't there like a real doll website, like an FAQ portion?

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:49.560
Or was like, how do I dispose of this when I'm through?

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.560
I don't think they want to shine a light on the fact

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.200
that these things are actually, you know,

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:56.160
that they must eventually go away.

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.400
I think pet stores are the same way.

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.920
Did you have any, like?

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.680
They don't say, hey, look at this.

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.960
Maltese ticket is to a fucking heartbreaking tragedy

01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:06.280
seven years from now.

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.280
Seven?

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.960
Did you have any, like, on average?

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.440
I'm guessing the answer is no.

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.080
Did you have any, like, how much time

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.320
did you spend with this doll?

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:18.760
And did you feel kind of any weird attachment to it?

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:21.120
Like, not like in a human way, but like, like.

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:21.960
No.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:24.400
Bye, Laura.

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.240
Bye.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.480
She wanted you to say yes.

01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:28.320
Steve.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.160
Yeah.

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.120
Did you look inside?

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.160
No.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.480
God, no.

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.520
That's not part of the job.

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:34.840
Steve, did you fuck it?

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.920
I was curious, like, what the head looked like.

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.040
Oh, I'm not.

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.520
I'm not, like, just like, I don't know what these things

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:43.360
actually look like.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.480
I've never looked at a picture, but.

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:45.320
They're online.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:46.160
You could see that online.

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.000
Yeah, I know.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:47.840
I guess I could have.

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.680
But whatever.

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:49.520
You showed up.

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.000
I thought that maybe there was some, like, sentimental value

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.960
because a dummy, because, you know,

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.600
it's like it inspired a show.

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:58.040
Well, yeah, I sent a photo of the box all taped up to Cody,

01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.280
who I don't think ever saw it.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.880
She was always asking me, can I please see it?

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:04.040
I'm like, no, because I'm ashamed of it.

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.800
You know, like, I don't, it's like,

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.680
one thing to be honest about having it,

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.560
it's another thing.

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.240
I don't want you looking at it.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.640
Like, it's like, me sitting up here saying,

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.200
like, I have a small dick, and I was like,

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.200
I don't know, like, show you it.

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.040
Like, because.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.360
Cody's never seen your dick.

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.200
Of course not.

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.040
Levy had to put it in a box and dispose of it.

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:38.280
I will say one thing that, like, for people,

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:41.520
I don't know, just like, because these graphic details.

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:46.040
Now that I imagine I am a previous sex doll owner

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.160
that will never probably own another one,

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:54.600
the one weird detail about it is.

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.680
Probably.

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:59.600
The arm, the shoulder joints,

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:03.200
like, you imagine like, you're dealing with this thing

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.160
that has like this skeleton, and it's like,

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:08.560
it has ball and socket joints where the shoulders are.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.200
It has, I think, ball and socket joints

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.440
where the hips are.

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.440
Because you want to be able to GI Joe the thighs,

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.520
wherever you want, but then the knees and the elbows

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:24.840
are simple 90 degree, like, whatever you call it.

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:28.880
Like, they rotate on one axis, not 360.

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.880
But the shoulders and the hips are ball and socket.

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:35.320
So, while for the legs, that's not really a problem

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.280
because you're not gonna like, move the legs in a way

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.520
that you're gonna then forget.

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:43.880
Like, it's like, the legs are just a bigger deal.

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:46.960
The arms, however, should you be deciding to,

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:51.480
I don't know, put a special outfit on this thing.

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:53.200
A cute top you picked out.

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.680
Like, you're gonna be like,

01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:01.680
you're gonna be moving the arms, like, up.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:08.840
And then, you might move the arms down,

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.200
and then you might move the arms this way,

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.080
and then you might move the arms this way,

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:17.120
and then in the, there's like, what we would call

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:20.080
in the 3D animation business, kind of like a gimbal lock,

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.440
kind of an effect that could happen

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.880
where the root rotation is kind of lost,

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:28.440
and you can notice over time,

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.080
like, this thing was in the box,

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.080
and the biceps had just become, like, twizzlers.

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:38.000
Like, they were just twisted

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.760
because the arms at some point had been rotated 360 degrees.

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:44.000
But Dan, some people find that pretty sexy.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.480
Yeah.

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.960
Well, also the fact that the silicone skin,

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:52.600
which, you know, health experts will tell you

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.160
it's constantly off-gassing.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:57.200
Like, so it's probably like, what the fuck is that?

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.040
It's a spider.

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.560
Long web.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.280
Man, if they ever make flying spiders,

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.440
I'm gonna kill myself.

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.960
Well, they say spiders actually do fly.

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:09.800
Yeah.

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:10.640
Because of the,

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.560
Didn't you see,

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.240
That's how they were able to spin their web so large.

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:14.080
Five from home.

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:14.920
What, they said, what?

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.280
Okay, so Dan, listen up.

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:18.240
You just, like, no one can look this up.

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.600
Like, spiders, spiders shoot out a silk

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:21.720
that goes in the air,

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.120
and then it catches, like, electron particles,

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.200
or something in the air,

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.600
and then it magnetically propels them,

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.720
like, they're surfing or flying a kite.

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:31.680
All right, well, then I'm already dead.

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:32.560
Oh, yeah.

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.600
So is Jeff.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.240
So is the audience.

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:38.000
Yeah, I think that thing's like a bat.

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.640
All right, so,

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:41.480
Sex doll.

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:42.800
Wait, what was the, oh, there's one other thing.

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.120
I was holding this.

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.600
So, there's one other thing for,

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.600
You're fucking a twizzler.

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:47.840
And you mean fucking it.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.440
For future sex doll owners,

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:52.000
I do wanna tell you one more thing.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.480
Like, watch those fingers,

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:55.040
because the fingers are wires.

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.160
They're just, like, gumby.

01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.520
Like, so, if you care, I mean, I didn't.

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.960
I'm, like, I'm not, like, a finger guy.

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.640
So, but, like,

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:04.480
I'm a big finger guy.

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.440
They're just gonna eventually just always be,

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.640
like, in this permanent state of, like,

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.920
a witch about to cast a spell.

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.360
Schrab's doing a funny.

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:16.360
Let's Steve take a picture.

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:19.600
That's a pretty good,

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.120
Uh,

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:23.960
Hubba, hubba.

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.800
And then,

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:31.280
And don't lay it down on anything with ink in it.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.160
Like, if you were to lay,

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.280
Because, because the silicone is, like,

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.120
It's sort of like,

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.600
Like, silicone putty.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.440
So, it's like,

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.120
The silicone is sort of like a,

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.280
You know, it's like,

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:46.640
They can't, like, store old Star Trek, like, prosthetics,

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.840
Because that silicone is, like, constantly enough.

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.520
It's, like, it's, like,

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:52.720
It's, like, slowly turning to goo.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.120
Just very slowly.

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.360
Which is what you want.

01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.360
And in the short term, though,

01:39:58.360 --> 01:39:59.360
You could, if you were, like,

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.640
To take a silicone, like,

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.080
Like, form and, like, lay it on something

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:06.000
That had, like, a cardboard box

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.120
That had, like, writing on it,

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:12.320
Then that writing could be on its tattoo,

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.040
On its arm forever.

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:14.880
So.

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.080
What was on hers?

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.400
This side up.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.240
Yeah, well.

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:20.920
Well, what does it say?

01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.920
What did it say, Pettix?

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.240
Well.

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.880
It was, I mean, I wanted to be something fun,

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.600
But it was just, no, it was just green.

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:34.280
It was just fucking, whatever it was laid on,

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:35.840
Wasn't a speck or anything.

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:36.680
It was just, like,

01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:39.440
So I looked down at this thing as a,

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.200
Before I saw it for the last time,

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:44.320
It was just, like, these, like, twisted arms

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.120
That were all, like, they really did look,

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:48.080
As I imagine, almost, like, decomposing,

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:50.760
Like, like, discolored, like, greenish, bluish.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:51.760
Horrifying.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.080
Like, like, like, the sister in pet cemetery.

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:54.920
Yeah.

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.880
Did you say the face is all fucked up?

01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:59.040
Like, the neck is, like, open?

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:01.720
Yeah, the neck, the neck,

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.280
The neck got, like, a tear in it at some point.

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.520
And unless you're gonna, like, super glue it.

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.040
Dan, what was your first interaction with the web?

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:11.880
When you got your first,

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:12.720
Because I remember that we,

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:13.560
You got your first,

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.400
Hello.

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:15.400
You got your,

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:16.240
You got your first real doll.

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:17.400
What do we have here?

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:18.240
Oh.

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.080
We didn't see you for a while.

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.960
You said, you said quite candidly

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.800
That you're gonna go away for a while.

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:23.080
My name's Daniel.

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:24.200
But when you first got out of the box.

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.080
No, don't, you don't have to talk.

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.520
What?

01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:29.800
Let me just,

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:32.560
Let me just look at you for a second.

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:33.400
Oh.

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.520
Oh, that's very interesting.

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.680
You say your shoulders are sore.

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:42.480
I'm like trying moves on.

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:44.040
I wait, I spent six months like.

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.200
Yeah, we could watch a movie if you'd like.

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:50.440
Oh, I am tired too.

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:52.560
A bed?

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.400
Yes, I have one.

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:54.600
Why do you ask?

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:56.640
I mean, we're talking about two rooms.

01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:58.880
I could drag you to the other room.

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.920
Don't touch my fingers.

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:07.080
Throw your octopus hands in the bed and.

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:10.560
Did you ever take a nap?

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.840
Like you were like cuddle?

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.680
Like was there like any post-coital stuff?

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:14.600
No.

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.400
You ever warm it up?

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:17.240
Water it up.

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.080
Warm it up.

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:18.920
Throw it in the microwave.

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.360
Warm it up like an electric blanket.

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.200
So it's got some body temperature.

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:23.200
No, I put pantyhose on it, rubbed the toes on my nipples,

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.400
jerked off, fell asleep.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.200
I'll warm you right up.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:32.200
I honestly wouldn't if I were, if I, if, if, if, if guys,

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:38.160
like I'm going to be with Cody, Cody is like Cody,

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:43.160
Cody eliminates the need for any extracurricular,

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:48.760
just I'm not, let's maintain our privacy, but she's like,

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:51.320
I don't need products anymore.

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:56.320
But if I, if, if, if in an alternate universe,

01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:00.360
knowing what I now know as a consumer, just to,

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:03.400
to shed light on my experience with these products,

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:05.760
I would, I would just get on Amazon.

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.240
Now you can just get, there's like, you can pick the,

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.920
you can get just a foot.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.600
You can get just a calf and a foot.

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:18.040
You can get just a calf foot and thigh.

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:21.200
You can get a foot with a pussy in it.

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:23.200
Yes, you can, which is really weird

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.840
because the pussy is in the ankle.

01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:25.680
The vagina ankle.

01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:27.680
So for guys that are like,

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:30.680
I just want to look at the foot, but upside down,

01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:33.760
God, I always just wished there was a pussy there.

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:36.680
And it's shaped like a pussy, which is weird.

01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:39.820
Cause it's like, wait, how could you have ever wanted that

01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:40.660
as a primate?

01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:43.160
Like that doesn't exist in nature even.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:47.520
I want just a calf, just a calf.

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:49.880
Yeah, but you can, you get, I think, I think, you know,

01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:54.320
it's like, you can also just get just the ass and two legs,

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.120
which I think maybe from, based on everything I've learned

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.240
and know that's probably the kind of guy I am.

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:06.240
As far as the use I'm going to get out of an artificial

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:13.880
female body, I, I'm pretty much good to go.

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:17.800
Like, like with a pair of fake legs and things, you know,

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:21.880
like I wouldn't, I just, I just find the, it was like,

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:25.760
I, I'm not a good caretaker.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:30.760
I, I, I, and, and, you know, never been a boob man.

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:36.520
And didn't, you know, this is like, I, I, I would be,

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:40.560
I was excited at the prospect cause I love, well, who,

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.880
you know, like, oh, you could get it wigs and you can,

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:45.360
but the thing you find out really quickly is, hey,

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:49.160
you know, uh, human women, like they, uh, they really take

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:53.160
really good care of their hair. Uh, it's, it's really a

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:54.920
constant battle against tangling.

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:58.400
And you can't just not care about something and like,

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.320
have it also be this thing that you find really, uh,

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:03.680
way to go human women.

01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:07.160
Okay. We got like seven.

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:11.000
What did you do with the, what did you do with you?

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.320
What did you do with the, the crate and be vague because we

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:17.800
don't want somebody digging it up somewhere and go,

01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:19.520
hey, I got it.

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:22.880
I, um, well, we're going to announce a strange kind of

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:23.880
contest now.

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:30.360
The prize is $200,000 in the form of a scholarship.

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.280
And of course, your own half rotted sex doll with green

01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:37.360
twisted arms.

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:44.080
I, I, I lifted up this enormous box and I carried it down

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:48.280
the stairs and all the way down to my car and then I loaded

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.080
it into my back seat because it was, it was the only space I

01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:53.080
could have fitted in.

01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:58.240
It was a weird long box body and then I got in my car.

01:45:58.240 --> 01:45:59.080
Yeah.

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:04.200
And, uh, I was like, uh, I don't, well, the first thing I

01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:08.760
thought was I passed a dumpster on the way here, but I feel

01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:10.080
like that's not safe enough.

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:13.080
Just in case some random person was digging through and saw

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:14.080
this taped up box.

01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:16.880
I was like, it still had Dan's name on it somewhere underneath

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:17.880
all that rapping.

01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:19.680
I was like, yeah, it's not, it's not a good idea.

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:23.280
So I called Spencer and I was like, and you know what I,

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.480
how I felt when I took field of this call?

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.880
Why did he not call me?

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:30.880
Why did, why did Dan not ask me to take care of this?

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.480
This is classic Spencer job, but I was hurt.

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.080
You've been free a long time.

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:39.280
I know, but it would have been an insult to call.

01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:40.680
I would have, I was hurt.

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:44.080
I was like, man, I really thought we had some.

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:49.680
You're, you're the Harvey Kytel to his.

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.080
I'm the wolf.

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:52.480
That's what that guy was called, right?

01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:54.080
You know, pulp fiction.

01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:55.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.680
Well, Spencer, Spencer gave me a lot of great options.

01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:01.480
His, his were really buttoned up.

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:04.280
Like I, we would have gotten away with it for sure.

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:05.280
We did it.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.880
Yeah, it was a lot more work though.

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:12.880
I called our PA up on who now writer's assistant on Rick and

01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:13.880
Morty.

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:14.880
Oh, good.

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.880
And I see this what I mean.

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:19.880
No, no, no.

01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:22.880
I just said, hey, where's the, where's the, where's the best

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:28.880
dumpster you know, not too far from the office and he suggested

01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:33.880
a really great one and that's where shouldn't be too hard to

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:34.880
figure out.

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:37.880
So if you could triangulate the location, well, it's not still

01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:38.880
there.

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:39.880
The dumps.

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:41.880
There's a lot of garbage today.

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:43.880
No, it wasn't today.

01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:46.880
It wasn't with you all day today.

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.880
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:52.880
You know that the dumpsters are like like a waste management

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:56.880
services are straight up hooked up with TMZ and they're going

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.880
to fucking find out about this and they're going to say that

01:47:58.880 --> 01:47:59.880
Dan Harmon threw.

01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:01.880
Well, I think I've been pretty much, I don't think there's

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:04.880
anything left to do except I like, I think you just look at

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:05.880
the thing.

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:07.880
It's embarrassing, but I think I've been pretty forthcoming

01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:09.880
with the fucking details.

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:14.880
I hope we live in a society where fucking honesty buys you

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:16.880
something, but I know we don't.

01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:20.880
So we're ending the podcast and in the meantime, I'm not going

01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:21.880
to go out lying.

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:25.880
I'm going to go out and throw out my fucking sex doll.

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:26.880
Here's what it looked like.

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:32.880
Like, like, all right, go find it, but it's greasy and gross.

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:34.880
It's covered in cigarettes.

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:35.880
This was weeks ago.

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:38.880
This thing is long gone.

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:41.880
Do you think there's like, like waste management people that

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:46.880
find a used real doll and go like, did we, aren't we send

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:48.880
all that stuff to China?

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:50.880
We don't anymore.

01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:52.880
We used to send all their garbage to China.

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:53.880
Yeah, they buy it up.

01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:54.880
Yeah, they stopped.

01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:56.880
They stopped like recently.

01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:57.880
They're like, we're done.

01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:59.880
We've got all the garbage we need.

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:00.880
Thank you.

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.880
I never knew we were like, well, what are we going to do with

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:03.880
all the garbage now?

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:04.880
Keep it.

01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:06.880
That's what we did.

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:07.880
Jesus.

01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:09.880
That is what they did.

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:11.880
Yeah, we don't want it anymore.

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:14.880
Yeah, they could have got a whole skeleton of titanium.

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:15.880
That's valuable.

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:18.880
Wait, so we were like always kind of like lambasting China for

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:22.880
falling behind in the terms of like the global like pollution

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:23.880
standards and stuff.

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:25.880
And we were just giving a march.

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.880
America is like, we have less other.

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:29.880
We're like shoveling shit over them.

01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:31.880
They used to be like, you're throwing on all this stuff.

01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:32.880
This is a good TV.

01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.880
What are you doing?

01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:39.880
China was just like that.

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:44.880
The character in the scavenger zone of every cyberpunk movie is

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:49.880
pushing the recycler.

01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:50.880
Poop van.

01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:51.880
All right.

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:52.880
Well, that's it.

01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:54.880
What do we got to plug Spencer?

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:57.880
Don't you have a harm request still exists?

01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:58.880
It's all out.

01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.880
So you can watch it on a free trial now if you want.

01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:06.880
Email them and tell them to put it out of the America if you

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:09.880
want to see it out of the America and tell them to give us

01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:10.880
another season.

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.880
I also did YouTube commentaries of this season.

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:17.880
So you can you can see like a goblin and be like, you know,

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:20.880
the thing about that goblin is he used to be red or whatever

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:23.880
the fuck.

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:24.880
So that's fun.

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:25.880
And then I don't know.

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:26.880
Are we going to get another season?

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:27.880
Do we know about that yet?

01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:28.880
I don't know about that.

01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:32.880
I and we won't know for probably too long like an embarrassing

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.880
amount of time.

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:36.880
So that's why you got to tell them be all like, oh man, I meant

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:37.880
to give you guys money.

01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:40.880
But next time I will if you do another season or something,

01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:43.880
you know, cliffhanger.

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:44.880
I get the plug.

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:45.880
Thank you all for coming.

01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:49.880
Oh shit.

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:52.880
And we're trying to clear our stock of 2019.

01:50:52.880 --> 01:51:03.880
Let's give it up for Steve Levy, everybody.

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:08.880
Let's give it up for Laura Austin as the inflatable crazy

01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:12.880
arm for us.

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:17.880
Also Zach up there, church, Brendan, Nolan, everybody here

01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:20.880

Rob Schrab, Spencer Crittenden, I'm Jeff Davis, Dan Harmon

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:28.880

01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:29.880
Thank you for coming.

01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.880
Drive fast and take chances.

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:54.880
Thank you all.
