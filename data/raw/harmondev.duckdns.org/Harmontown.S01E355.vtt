{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:29.000\nHello, Hurray and Hurrah, welcome all from MacArthur Park.\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:35.000\nHarmontown is now in session. We're doing a giving away sale right now.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:51.000\nEverything must go. Let's bring out a 1994 Rob Schrab. A 1994 almost mint condition Rob Schrab.\n\n00:51.000 --> 01:08.000\nRob Schrab. Rob Schrab, only 4,000 miles on him.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:21.000\nThe all new 2020 Spencer Crittenden. 2020 Dice, four wheel drive.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:29.000\nAnd let's bring out the 1973 Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:39.000\nOh boy. Thank you for coming out to my show. Thank you.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:43.000\nThank you, Laura. You're not done. You're not done.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:55.000\nWe got two hours. The whole show. She has to do that for two hours.\n\n01:55.000 --> 02:04.000\nYeah, everything must go. That bit was pretty classic, Jeff.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:05.000\nClassic Jeff.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:09.000\nIt's like two minutes before the show he goes,\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nShe got walk off a plus.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:16.000\nOh yes, Laura everybody.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:22.000\nShe knew it was a self, I don't want to be like Trump, but she knew what she signed up for.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:27.000\nBut that's her Halloween costume. And then Jeff was like, should we ever go out and do this thing?\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:30.000\nAnd I'm like, anything you want.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:31.000\nYeah, we're fun.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:35.000\nAnd Jeff's like, so how should I do it? How should we do it?\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:41.000\nAnd I'm like, why don't you do it like this? And I was like, well, I guess maybe like a used car thing.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:43.000\nThen you can introduce us each as if we're like.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nThe bit we just saw.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:47.000\nPretty close.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:51.000\nThe bit you just saw for $5 every month.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:56.000\nBut then you're like, let's bring out a 1994 Spencer Crittenden.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:01.000\nAnd I'm like, well, maybe a couple more car phrases before.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:02.000\nYou want to do it again?\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nI don't want to do it again.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nHow about we do the whole thing over again?\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nBut you, you are me and you do introduce everybody.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\nCan I wear the costume?\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:17.000\nMan, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't like pimping the audience to.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nYou just like haranguing me for not doing it.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:21.000\nI just thought it was kind of funny.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:22.000\nIt was like, it's just classic.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nIt gives it, you're like, should we do this?\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:25.000\nYes, we should.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:26.000\nAnd you're like, how?\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nHow do we do it?\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:34.000\nWe've lost.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nOh, here we go.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nI went to Norway.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:45.000\nI was at an animation festival in Fredrikstad.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:46.000\nGreat.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:52.000\nI think your story will have to be on hold for at least five minutes.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:55.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nRob's got a tablecloth.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nRob has got $5.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\nEverybody you can watch.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:07.000\nIt's Nosferatu.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nWhat is the eyebrows?\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.000\nThe eyebrows are like, I did it.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:12.000\nI nailed it.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:13.000\nWhat did you do?\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nYou didn't do anything.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:19.000\nYou, yeah.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:20.000\nYeah.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nI got off of one of your piece of shit chairs.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:30.000\nAnd there's a stack of considerably more comfortable chairs right there.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nA stack.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:38.000\nA stack with cushions.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nAnd a Dracula cape.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:45.000\nSo I shit my pants.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:46.000\nIn Norway?\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nWell, on the plane.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:49.000\nOh, no.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nFrom Norway to Heathrow.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nThe whole time?\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:59.000\nI thought, well, I was kind of sitting in it without knowing it the whole time.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nHow do you not know you shit your pants?\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:02.000\nIt happens.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:05.000\nIt happens.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:06.000\nI woke up.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nI think you know.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:09.000\nI think you know.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nYou're suspicious.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nYou are suspicious.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nThis is a first.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:20.000\nAs we know, I've had many stories where I didn't know what I thought was a fart was a shit.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:25.000\nBut then pretty much the story ends with it coming out into my pants.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nBut this was different.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:30.000\nI woke up from the hotel room the day of our departure.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nI was kind of blowing a lot of farts.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:37.000\nI drank a lot of beer and ate a lot of delicious stuff.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nFarting all over the place.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nThey're big, empty, windy farts.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nThey're not really hurting anybody.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nThey're not bothering anybody.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:46.000\nThey're just sort of...\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nVictimless farts.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nThey're loud and fun.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:55.000\nWe're laughing about it.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nWe get to the airport.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nWe get on the airplane.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nI get another big one brewing in me.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nBut I'm not going to do it in the cabin.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:09.000\nThis is a flight from Norway to Heathrow then connecting back to LA.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nHow long of flight is that?\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:14.000\nLondon being the Chicago of Europe.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\nSo this is like a two hour flight, two and a half hour flight?\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nYeah, two hour flight.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:25.000\nOn one of those flights where they're happy to take your first class money.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:29.000\nBut the plane is simply a bus.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:33.000\nAnd for your first class money, what they'll do is they'll take that money\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:39.000\nand they'll put a tray in the middle seat in the front four rows.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:45.000\nThose people all paid extra money so they didn't have to rub their arm on a poor person.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nAnd that's first class.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:52.000\nBut you can't buy people not rubbing your fucking head as they walk by,\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\npeople bumping you with their jackets.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nI mean, everyone's crammed in the same fucking thing.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nThat's why you got to get the window seat, baby.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nNo, that would be Cody's.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:07.000\nSo I go to the bathroom during that flight and I'm peeing.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:12.000\nAnd men, when we pee, if you've ever been in a public restroom with men at urinals,\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:17.000\nthey take the opportunity and maybe it's partially, it kind of happens while you're peeing.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:22.000\nIt tends to happen, it's like a time to fart.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:26.000\nAnd sometimes you're in a men's room and somebody's like,\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:30.000\nlike at the urinal and you kind of have this reaction like,\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nwhat the fucking guy's farting?\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:34.000\nIn the bathroom.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nYeah, but it's...\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.000\nHow dare you?\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:43.000\nOh, are you my joke's agent?\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nHe's here, everybody.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nMy joke has representation.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nIs this a package deal and this joke?\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:59.000\nOr the fuck did you think I was pointing out, you fuck?\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:06.000\nSo anyways, I go to the men's room or the people's room on the plane.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nThere's no men's room.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nPlanes are the future.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:15.000\nAnd I'm peeing and then I just let out this...\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nIt's loud.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:17.000\nIt was loud.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nIt's kind of a contrabassion.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nBecause I've been sitting on it and I've been very gassy,\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:23.000\nbut I've been sitting on this one.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nSo buildovers are like...\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nHorn of Gondor.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:33.000\nAnd then I go back and I sit for an hour and 57 minutes\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nand then we land in Heathrow\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:39.000\nand everyone starts doing their little restless bustle\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nand getting ready to get up and I'm moving around\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:46.000\nand I'm like, oh, did I sweat in my butt crack that much?\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nIs there substance?\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:51.000\nAnd then I kind of stood up in the seat\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nand I'm like, that feels like...\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:54.000\nWrong.\n\n08:54.000 --> 09:00.000\nThat feels wrong and also it smells a little bit like...\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nLike butt release.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:05.000\nWell, because smell is like this crazy sense memory.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nThe thing I always, when I smell like diaper smell,\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nI always remember my sister's hospital\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nbecause I was like, when I was a kid,\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:16.000\nthat was the first time I'd ever been around like adult poopoos.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:21.000\nWas this institution where my sister was being housed\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:25.000\nand I've told the story before about the Moo Moo guy.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:30.000\nHow much time had elapsed since you think you released the poopoos\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nand then you noticed...\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nWell, it was when I said two hours.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nTwo hours.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:40.000\nAnd so I guess I was just sitting on it like...\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nAnd then I'm walking in the airport and I'm like,\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nI got to wipe my ass, honey.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nAnd she's like, why did you shit your pants?\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nI'm like, no.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nThat's crazy.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nObviously not.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nThat would be insane.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:54.000\nIf I did that, then I would have reacted to that.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:58.000\nI just have to wipe my sweaty, fat ass.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nTraveling, it's an airport.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nI guess this is something that happens.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nI guess I just have to wipe my sweaty ass.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:07.000\nAnd then we get to the airport lounge and it's all packed and stuff.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nAnd there's a guy sitting there looking at his phone.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:17.000\nIt's one of these... The bathroom is all these fancier...\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:21.000\nAmerica tends to go for the metal stalls.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:26.000\nBut in Europe, you're more likely to get these closets.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nTeak.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:30.000\nMaybe some exotic hardwoods.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:34.000\nAnd so it's just a room lined with all these little rooms\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nthat are impenetrable.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nIt's hard to see, vacancy or occupied.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nI guess there's a little red thing.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:45.000\nBut it's not really beamed out to your eyeball.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nYou kind of have to crouch and look.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nAnd there's a guy standing there, thumbing on his phone.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nIt looks like he's probably... What the hell is he doing?\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nHe's probably waiting for one of these bathrooms.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:54.000\nIt means they're all occupied, right?\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:55.000\nSo I get behind him.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nI'm waiting and waiting and looking around.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:01.000\nAnd there's a bathroom with its door kind of not all the way closed.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nAnd I wait and I wait and I'm looking at it.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nAnd I'm hoping he sees my eye contact and then he realizes\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nmaybe he missed a bathroom opening.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nAnd then I finally go, is that one open over there?\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nAnd he's kind of like blithely.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.000\nI suppose he's like, go for it.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nGovner.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nHe didn't say governor, but like he is like...\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nHe's just like chickadeiro or something like that.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:26.000\nIt was like go nuts or something like blithe kind of like have a blast.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:30.000\nThe old school British phrase, go nuts.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nSo then I went over there.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nI open it up.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:38.000\nAnd it's a handicap version of all these things.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\nSo I'm like, ah, ah, ah.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:45.000\nAnd I look back at him and he, I don't know if he's like, you know,\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:49.000\nis it like Forest Whitaker in the dream and crying game where he's like laughing?\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:52.000\nI was like, haha, it's a handicap style.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nI told you to, I told you to check it out.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:55.000\nAnd now you're...\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nI never saw grinding.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nCrying game.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:00.000\nOh.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nAnyway, it doesn't matter.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nDon't get distracted.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nI need that.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nSo now I get it.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nOkay.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nSo, so I just like, I got the door open.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:09.000\nIt's a bathroom.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nThere's no, there's nobody, there's no special needs people in sight.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nI'm kind of like, I don't know what the etiquette is.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nI don't know if that guy was like...\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nNo cop, no stop.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nNo Forest Whitaker.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nYou're free to go shittaker.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nAnd I, and I have a sweaty ass.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nSo I'm like, all right.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nWell, I need this.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nSo up till now, you don't know that like what's, what is actually...\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nHe's in denial.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nOkay.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nGotcha.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nSo I go in and I...\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:37.000\nWe're two hours 15 minutes into you having to shut yourself.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nI unbutton my pants.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nI pull them down and grab the toilet paper.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.000\nI wipe at the sweaty butt and I pull it away.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:46.000\nAnd it's like, holy fudge.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:53.000\nLike, like, like just covered like as if I just took a shit, which I guess I did.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:59.000\nNot to be disgusting.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:03.000\nBut opaque, not opaque, chunk.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nJust gross.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nJust like, imagine taking a shit and then fucking sitting in it.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nLike a turd?\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nNo, that's not like an intact turd.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:11.000\nA turd wouldn't like, it's not like a cartoon.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:15.000\nSo it isn't anything then.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nGo continue with your...\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:24.000\nWait, Jeff, what did you write down?\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nHoly fudge.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:31.000\nIt's important that someone documents the shit.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:36.000\nSo now that I'm seeing it, I'm like, okay, well, that wasn't sweat.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:37.000\nOkay.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nAnd then I'm like, well, hopefully it was just one of those things where there goes like\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:45.000\na, you know, that wet of a, that productive of a fart.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:51.000\nAnd like, and it's just like, I had like, like my big bear like ass cheeks just kind of contained\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:56.000\nthis grand canyon of poop and like, I wiped it away and I look in the underwear.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nI'm like, whoa.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nOh no.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nOh, Hershey's Rorschach.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nFucking like...\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nIt's like the Watchmen in there.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nYeah.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nHow do you spell Rorschach?\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:11.000\nWatchmen in your pants.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:14.000\nHa ha ha ha.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nRock shots, journal.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nTake off my shoes.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:18.000\nTake off my pants.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:19.000\nTake off my shoes.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nYeah.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:21.000\nTake off your pants.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:22.000\nTake off your pants.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nYou got to take off your shoes.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:31.000\nI take off my underwear, gingerly step out of them like tires in the, in an army training\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:39.000\ncourse and fold up the really unreturnable pair of meundies and...\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nOh no.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nAnd drop the spawn garter.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:46.000\nWhich, by the way, are made of the softest micro modell.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:51.000\nAnd they have 100% guarantee so you can send them right back if you're not satisfied.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:57.000\nWell, you can, you can take that up with the good people of British Airways.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nYeah.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nYeah.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:01.000\nKeep going.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nKeep going.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:06.000\nWhatever poor physically challenged person that actually had a right to use that particular\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:11.000\nbathroom is now going to go in there and go like, oh, who fucking shit in the garbage\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:12.000\ncan.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:13.000\nIn the toilet area.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nAnd the ironic answer is, oh, me fucking Mr. Physical Privilege.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:23.000\nMr. Bounding around on two great legs I had to fucking like ruin their haven.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:29.000\nAnd I had to put on my pants with no underwear.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nWait a second.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nCan I walk it back for a second?\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nYou took your shoes off.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.000\nYeah.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:34.000\nYou took your trousers off.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nYeah.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nYou took your meundies off.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:38.000\nDisposed of them?\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nI assume.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nPut them in the garbage can.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nMore or less.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:44.000\nPut them in the garbage can in the stall with you?\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:52.000\nI mean, it's a handicap stall in a country that doesn't really, in an airport lounge,\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nit's like more into water closets than stalls.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nSo we're talking about like kind of a small room.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:57.000\nOkay.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nSo there was a trash can.\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nYeah.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:07.000\nSo you pitched your soiled meundies into the bin and then you cleaned yourself up.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nHopefully.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:16.000\nDid your, did meundies save your trousers from the, from the climate action?\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.000\nYeah.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nOf course they did.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nYeah.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nBut I will say.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nSpencer, why do you think they did?\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:24.000\nThat's because of micromodal fabric.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:25.000\nAll right.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:30.000\nBut I will say in all fairness, I was wearing brown pants.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.000\nYeah.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:32.000\nSo.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nOh, that's pro tip.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:39.000\nBut also a margin of error in my data.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nI think I got away clean, but.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:42.000\nAll right.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:43.000\nSo if I didn't.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:44.000\nI don't know if that's right.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nYou're not, you're, you're going commando.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nI go commando back to my duffel bag.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nI look at Dino and Cody and I go.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nDino's in the bathroom with you?\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.000\nNo.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nI go back to the lounge.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nGotcha.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:00.000\nAnd I get my, I get a new pair of meundies out of my duffel bag.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:06.000\nAnd as I look at them and go.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:10.000\nYou know, and Trump's on TV bragging about how he killed the head of ISIS.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nHe killed ISIS single handedly.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:17.000\nAnd I'm like, there, you know, it's, it's a day of gives and takes.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:21.000\nDave triumphs and defeats.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nI am having a bad day.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nThe president is having a good day.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nThat's usually how it works.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:30.000\nSo I, I, I salute the television.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:38.000\nAnd hey, hey, did you guys know that when you're in Europe, you know, it's, it's crazy because\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:52.000\nlike their news coverage makes him look like a fucking idiot.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:56.000\nIt's probably the only time in our nation's recent like post television history when there\n\n17:56.000 --> 18:01.000\nactually is no fucking disparity because it's like just as mean to be objective with that\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:02.000\nguy.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:07.000\nHe's just like, but you know, fucking, uh, Al Jazeera says the same shit about him as\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:12.000\nCNN because it's just like the president who just said he was nine feet tall and his dick\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:13.000\nis a whistle.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:18.000\nLike how, what, what, what negative spin are you going to put on that?\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:23.000\nLike you either, you either pretend that's cool or, or, or you just tell people what\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nhappened again.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:31.000\nUm, so anyways, yeah, uh, I went back in and I, uh, used a different stall thereby realizing\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:37.000\nhow lucky I was because yeah, the other stalls, they don't have garbage bins and, uh, I don't\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:38.000\nknow what I would have done.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:43.000\nI would have walked out with a fucking lot of shit in a, in the softest fabric known to\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\nman.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:45.000\nI was worried for you.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:46.000\nI don't know.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:49.000\nI've had to throw out underwear before in a public place.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nYeah.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:51.000\nSo.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nSo you go back in.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:57.000\nYou change your, uh, a little quiet there.\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nYeah.\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nYou do me on these change.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nYou put the brown trousers back on.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nYep.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nNo harm, no foul.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nYep.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nAll's well that ends well.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nNo foul.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nSome.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nSoiler alert.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nHmm.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nOh boy.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nYeah.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:13.000\nGood one.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nYeah.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nOh boy.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:20.000\nBring out the, the, bring out the inflatable person.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:23.000\nOh boy.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:28.000\nShould she come out every time you nail one?\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:29.000\nI'll tell you what.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nI could use vodka right now.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nOh shit.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:38.000\nWe better bring out Steve Levy at some point.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:44.360\nOh, so before the show happened, Steve Levy came out a few times and was treated to just\n\n19:44.360 --> 19:48.560\na thunderous applause and audience reaction.\n\n19:48.560 --> 19:52.000\nWas that because of last week when we talked about it or was that just organic?\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:53.000\nOkay.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nI'm hearing some yeses.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nI thought so.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nWhat?\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nWhat happened?\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nGood to hammer out.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:02.000\nWell, we just kind of, we kind of joked about how Levy came out before the show.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:08.000\nThe show was tremendously delayed last time, more than usual, and, uh, like, as a.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:09.000\nYeah.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nOh.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:26.000\nCause that joke was so good earlier and it's a tender moment for us all to enjoy.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:27.000\nYeah.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:32.000\nThere's no, by the way, there's no guests tonight.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nSo this is it.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.000\nWe got a person in there.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:40.000\nThat is correct.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:44.000\nI should do something about how many more.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nI'm bad at math.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:46.000\nHow many more?\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.000\nHere's something.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:48.000\nFive.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nFive.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:53.000\nSo this, this is the five more after this or this five more after this.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:56.000\nThis one and five more.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nSo six.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nSix.\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.000\nFive.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:06.000\nOne and five five point seven two.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nRight.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nAbout.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nYeah.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:10.000\nWhat did Dan here?\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nI just heard this like high-pitched tone.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nThat's that fan that, that's that fan.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:17.000\nWhat inflates the wacky with lady and played a warm, playing tube man.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nBut there's a lady in there.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nWoman.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:21.000\nWhat?\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nWoman.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:23.000\nNot man.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nI said it bad.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:28.000\nOh, I thought you were saying I should say woman instead of lady.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nNo, you should though.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:31.000\nWhy not?\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:32.000\nDon't.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:36.000\nWe'll talk after the show.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:39.000\nThere was a.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nThere was a.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nBut we won't though.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nNo, we won't.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:45.000\nI'm busy.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nWhat did Dan here?\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:56.000\nThere was a, there was a lady animator legendary Norwegian lady animator getting a\n\n21:56.000 --> 22:02.000\nlifetime achievement award at the festival.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:06.000\nAnd the host was going over her credentials.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:10.000\nAnd I swear he said, Cody and I both heard the same thing.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:20.000\nHe said, and of course, if you are familiar with animation at all, then you know the movie\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nPoop Van Two.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nPoop Van Two?\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nShe worked on that.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:29.000\nAnd then he just kept going and Cody and we're like poof it.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:33.000\nAnd then afterwards we were asking about it, but no one, no one could tell it.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nNo one was like, Oh, no, no, no.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nGoop.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.000\nGum.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nDo.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:39.000\nIt's a, it's like our Jumanji.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:40.000\nLike there was nothing.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nNo one, no one remembered hearing it.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nNo one could explain.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:46.000\nIt was, I swear he said Poop Van Two.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:52.000\nNow, and the only, the only differing opinion about that was Dino who heard Poop Man Two.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nCody and I both heard Poop Van Two.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:59.000\nAnd it's like the idea that there, I mean, that sounds like a great animated film.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:04.000\nThe sequel of one at least.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nAnd then there was, and then there was more.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:11.000\nWhat do you think, what do you think Poop Man Two does answer the questions of Poop Man?\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nI don't know, but I know Poop Man Two.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:16.000\nI don't, I wouldn't even care about, but Poop Van Two.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:24.000\nI think this is like a great movie because like, there probably is a Poop Man in that movie, but he's accompanied by three to five friends and a dog.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nAnd they're all pretty comfortable.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nPoop Van Two.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.000\nI don't know.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:31.000\nI just picture like kind of a cool like road movie or something.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nPoop Van Two.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:43.000\nLike Poop, there was a movie called Poop Van and it, and in spite of its obstacles, it did so well that people were like, yes, another.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:49.000\nThey heard that the Poop Man was so long, they cut it into two pieces.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:54.000\nIt was like a, like a kill bill.\n\n23:54.000 --> 24:00.000\nThey had to use that special fork that we all keep in the bathroom to break it up.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:04.000\nThat special fork we all keep in the bathroom.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:10.000\nAnother thing that the guy said, which he said she also did.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nHe goes right on his phone after saying that.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.000\nI'm looking up.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:14.000\nI'm looking up the body.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nYou're looking up your bathroom.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nIs it maybe Port Van Two?\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nPork Van.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:21.000\nPort Van.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:22.000\nPort Van.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nYeah, I'm looking up for filmography.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nOh, that would have meant to.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:29.000\nIt's probably very likely that that's what he said.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:34.000\nIt's less likely that she worked on both that and Poop Van Two.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:37.000\nThere's also Two Van Toby.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nTwo Van Toby.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:43.000\nWhat did you think that was, Dan?\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:48.000\nBut another thing that she worked on, apparently, that they were going to show that weekend,\n\n24:48.000 --> 25:02.000\nthe guy said something like he goes, and she just did work on the only educational video\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:12.000\nabout sexual assault of kindergartners for kindergartners.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:18.000\nAnd it was just the way that he kept like, like, he kept, it was like, he was like,\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:22.000\nI don't know, it just sounded like such an inappropriate, like, advertisement.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:26.000\nLike, like, if you thought sexual assault of kindergartners was a fucking thing.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:32.000\nSunday, Sunday, Sunday.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:36.000\nIt seemed like the audience every time he was before he let in would be like,\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:42.000\nthe first animated, wait a second, for kindergarten.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:46.000\nI don't think it's a good financial model to really like pitch your film for kindergarteners\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:49.000\nbecause they don't have a lot of discretionary money.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:54.000\nWell, I don't think, I think this was probably a job that she did for the government\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nbecause it was educational.\n\n25:56.000 --> 26:00.000\nI think the budget was probably fixed.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:03.000\nHow was your time overall in Scandinavia?\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:06.000\nIt was a lot of fun. Those are good people.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:13.000\nI like, you know, they're self-described as a kind of like compartmentalized people\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:18.000\nthat they're sort of, you know, it's a colder climate.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:23.000\nAnd whereas you might think, oh, that makes them all warm and fuzzy,\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:28.000\nthey're a little more, you know, more than a few of them kind of self-described\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:36.000\nthe Norwegian people as being kind of a, not cold, but like, yeah,\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:40.000\nI would say compartmentalized. They didn't use that word but listening to them describe it.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nThat's sort of what they're describing.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:46.000\nLike, which kind of, you know, it's like, they like to get drunk\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:54.000\nand like they sort of view getting drunk as like its own thing and what happened there stays there.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:59.000\nAnd one of them described the culture as like sort of like,\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:02.000\nand this is one person like they might be their own point of view.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:06.000\nThis isn't like a traditional thing, but like, you know, like in Norway,\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:10.000\nyou might get drunk and like have a great time with somebody,\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:14.000\neven sleep with them or something and then you see them the next day at a grocery store\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:18.000\nand I just don't pretend you act like you never met them.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:22.000\nThat could be that own person's take on life.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:28.000\nBut the general picture all kind of averaged out was just sort of like this kind of Nordic,\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:32.000\nlike, yeah, compartmentalized, which I do respect.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:38.000\nAs long as it's not dishonest and nobody gets hurt, I like the idea of distance,\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:43.000\nprofessional distance and things, they're not big huggers, they said and things like that.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:46.000\nBut there's a difference between that and not being nice.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:53.000\nThey're really wonderfully nice and funny people and they all kind of look like Spencer or Dave Kline.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:59.000\nAnd they're just very, like, it's hard to escape the Viking thing\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:09.000\nbecause they're so jolly and, you know, broad-shouldered and kind of like, you know, hyperbolic and fun.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:13.000\nSo it was great drinking with them. Like Vikings. When I think...\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:17.000\nFun, fun Vikings. When I think fun, I think Vikings.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:21.000\nBefore the circus came to town, the Vikings did.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:25.000\nI was only in, like, I was in Stavanger, Norway once and there was a bar.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:30.000\nPeople got in fights, like a middle-aged guy tackled a slightly older guy\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nand hip tackled him like a linebacker.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:35.000\nAnd then they got up and then danced together and had a drink\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:40.000\nand it was like no harm, no foul, no blood, no ambulance, everything was groovy.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nNo antelopes.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nWhat's a hip tackle?\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nWhat's a who?\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:45.000\nWhat's a hip tackle?\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nLike, will you tackle somebody with a hip?\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.000\nTheir hip?\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:52.000\nYes.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:53.000\nOkay.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:57.000\nI mean, if you tackle somebody with your own hip, I think that's just called doing the booty bump.\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:00.000\nYeah, that's what I think when I hear hip tackle.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:05.000\nThere were more than, there was a handful of people who traveled like great distances by train and car\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:12.000\nfrom all over Europe to come and just see me in particular because of Harmontown ending.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:19.000\nIt's surprising to encounter people from Norway that were like such big Harmontown fans.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nWhy wasn't I invited?\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:26.000\nBecause I guess we didn't know that I was going there to talk to them.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:31.000\nHow do they say Rick and Morty in Norwegian?\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:34.000\nRick and Morgan.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:45.000\nI did try to write a song in Norwegian thinking, maybe if I chipped away over a couple of days,\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:51.000\nlike oh man, writing a song in a foreign language is like that you don't actually know.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:58.000\nBecause in English, you're a brilliant songwriter.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:03.000\nYeah, getting an Emmy for it is some kind of metric.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nAll right.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nOkay.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:12.000\nI mean, I never bring it up, but you kind of did.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:17.000\nWhat was your eyes into the Norwegian language that you thought you could do it?\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:24.000\nWell, it was more the eyes. I stopped short of trying to rhyme because it was such a challenge\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:30.000\nto just, because you're thinking in a melody and then you're thinking of syllables.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:36.000\nSo then you're thinking English syllables and then you're like, oh, the other day I had a sausage\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nand you're like, that's the right amount of syllables.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nNow you're going to put that in Google Translate.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:43.000\nYou're going to find out how to say the other day I had a sausage in Norwegian.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nThere's going to be a totally different amount of syllables.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nSo now are you going to adjust the melody?\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:48.000\nAre you going to rephrase?\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nAre you going to search around for words?\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:56.000\nAnd then on top of that, now you've got to look at the word that it's ending with, I guess,\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nwhich is going to be like Margar Bar.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nAnd you're going to be like, oh, I know what rhymes with that.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:01.000\nNo, you don't.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:05.000\nYou don't know a single word that rhymes because you don't know the language.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:08.000\nSo I was kind of like, wow, that was interesting.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:16.000\nI kind of thought in the day of Google Translate and I underestimated the difficulty.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nDid you get one done?\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:22.000\nNo, I got like the first line of something done and I kind of tried it out at my panel.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:25.000\nDid you try finding like a Norwegian rhyme dictionary?\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nI don't know.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\nWhat would it be called?\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nI don't know the word for rhyme.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:33.000\nWell, if you typed in Norwegian rhyme dictionary.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:34.000\nYou know what?\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:35.000\nThis guy.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nI didn't try that.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:38.000\nYeah.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:41.000\nYou figured out how I could have done it.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nDid you pick up?\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nI think it's always a good thing when you travel.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nI don't know if you're being serious or not.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:49.000\nWell, I just sort of like, what are you, my mom?\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nLike, what is your problem?\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:54.000\nYou've been shitty to me since I sat down here.\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nI haven't seen you in weeks.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:57.000\nI come in.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:58.000\nHey, how you doing?\n\n31:58.000 --> 31:59.000\nYou look at the floor.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nYou don't say anything.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:04.000\nAnd you're just shitting on everything I do.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:11.000\nAnd I came out here because there's only six episodes left.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nFive and a half.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:13.000\nI didn't have to.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nI could have stayed home with Kate and Lolly.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:19.000\nAnd now you're shitting on everything I say.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nWhat did I ever do, man?\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:22.000\nYou know, God damn well.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:23.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:24.000\nThat's why I'm asking.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nThat you come here whenever you want.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.000\nAnd it's always when your dog and your wife kick you out.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:30.000\nNo, it's not true.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:33.000\nThere's nobody waiting for you that you could have been with.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.000\nNo, that's not true.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nIt was this or being under a bridge.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nHow would you know?\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:38.000\nHow would you know?\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nWhat is your fucking problem?\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nBecause I've known you for 20 years.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:43.000\nMore than that.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:44.000\nYeah.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nSo it's like...\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.000\nSo what?\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:48.000\nWhat?\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:49.000\n30 years.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:53.000\nSo I know what it's like to be your dog and Kate.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:54.000\nI do.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nI can only imagine.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:59.000\nI know that every once in a while, they're going to be like,\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:00.000\nwhy don't you go do the heart attack show?\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nNo, don't even.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nDon't even put words in, Kate.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nAnd you have to pull like straws out of your lips\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:09.000\nand like fucking cotton squabs off your eyebrows\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:10.000\nthat you glued with toothpaste.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:13.000\nBecause you thought it would be funny in the middle of Kate\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nprobably like trying to confide with you about something\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:16.000\nthat was troubling her at work.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:19.000\nAnd you're like, she said a word that rhymed with claws,\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nyour Santa Claus.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:24.000\nAnd you're like, oh, oh, oh.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:25.000\nLike...\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nAnd she's like...\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:30.000\nThis is not based on any true events at all.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nThis is completely made up.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:36.000\nThat is not true.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:45.000\nI've been doing toothpaste Santa Claus for 20 plus years.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:49.000\nI need a new bit.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:52.000\nDoes toothpaste work on cotton balls?\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:55.000\nFor glue, yeah.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nIf you're strapped.\n\n33:57.000 --> 34:00.000\nSo that wasn't a riff that Dan actually knows that you do that.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:03.000\nI've done it a couple of times.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:10.000\nI did it last Christmas.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:16.000\nI woke Kate up Christmas morning\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:22.000\nwith a red shirt and white tape down my cotton all over my face\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:26.000\nand two oven mitts.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nOh, Mary.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:40.000\nWhat is this minty, fresh elf doing in here?\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nI thought that gave you joy.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nI didn't realize it pissed you off.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nLet's go down memory lane.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nDo you guys remember the very first time you met\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:49.000\nand what the interaction was?\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nYou and Schrab?\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nI remember...\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:54.000\nSomeone says I know it.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nSomeone knows.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:57.000\nYou do?\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nOkay.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:02.000\nWhat do you fucking know?\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:05.000\nI remember the very first time I saw you two.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:11.000\nI noticed Schrab after a comedy sports workshop\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:15.000\nand he was wearing his fucking leather baseball cap\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:23.000\nand his gray sweatshirt.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:28.000\nWe were having vice beers with Bo Johnson\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:35.000\nafter the workshop and then Schrab was talking about...\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:38.000\nHe's eating Fritos and drinking beer\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nand he said something like,\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:46.000\nyou know, they put riboflavin in these chips.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:49.000\nYou guys hear this?\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nThey put riboflavin.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:54.000\nThey put meat tenderizer\n\n35:54.000 --> 36:00.000\nand it makes you thirsty for some chemical in Coke.\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:06.000\nSo if you eat Fritos, you get tenderized\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nand then you want Coke\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:13.000\nand then the Coke makes you want Fritos.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nThis is the first interaction?\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:20.000\nThat's the first time I was like, who the fuck is this?\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:25.000\nBut were you both on Milwaukee Comedy Sports this time?\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nNo, we were students.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:28.000\nWe were in high school.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nWe were aspiring.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:33.000\nWe were aspirants to that throne.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nAnd you were not in high school?\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nWere you already on the squad, Rob?\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:40.000\nNo, no, I was in workshops.\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nBut I was in my last year of college.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nHad you both just moved to Milwaukee?\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nWere you still in Red Deer or Brown River?\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:49.000\nThat was like my fourth year in Milwaukee.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:54.000\nI was probably in between living with my parents in Brown Deer\n\n36:54.000 --> 37:00.000\nand living with McKenna on the east side of Milwaukee.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:03.000\nWell, that's not true because I wouldn't be living with McKenna.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nSo I was probably just pretty much living with my parents\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nand crashing on people's couches in Milwaukee.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:10.000\nDid you and Rob connect that first day or did it take a while?\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nI think it took a while.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:17.000\nI think we're still trying to connect.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nNo, I think we connected.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:20.000\nWe did all right.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nWho cares?\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nThere's a question for the ages.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nWho cares?\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:27.000\nRob does.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:28.000\nI do.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:29.000\nYou do too.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nHe pretends like he doesn't.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nThat's his shield.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nHow important is your friendship to Rob's job?\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:38.000\nYeah, it's worth like a billion dollars.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nIt's worth its weight in gold.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:42.000\nWait, so you put it into financial terms?\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:48.000\nWell, when you see Rob, you see just a giant bag of cash.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:51.000\nNo, no, I said what's worth to him.\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:57.000\nNo, to you, like emotionally.\n\n37:57.000 --> 38:01.000\nOh, it's worth a thousand hugs.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nNot a billion dollars, just a thousand hugs.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:04.000\nI don't measure.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nI don't see things through that lens.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:09.000\nWhat is the hug to dollar conversion?\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nNine.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:14.000\nThat's not bad.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:17.000\nHe made Rob leave the stage.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:23.000\nIt looks like he's floating ahead of floating head.\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:26.000\nHe's like a green screen guy.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:27.000\nWhy that expression?\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:28.000\nWhat's the expression?\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:31.000\nHe's shocked that his head is floating.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:37.000\nYou're shocked to be a floating head.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:40.000\nJeff's helping.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nQuote unquote.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:45.000\nBut handing him something to hold with his hands\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nthat aren't supposed to be there.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:51.000\nWhy did that help the illusion?\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nPut a sweater on him.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:59.000\nYeah, we can crop those out though.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nI don't have anything to talk about anyway, so.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:07.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:11.000\nJust doing something behind the curtain.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:15.000\nThat's why you had to be behind the curtain.\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:19.000\nThey shuffle back to their seats.\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nSomeone really enjoyed that.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nWas this big news here, too?\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:28.000\nThe 38 bodies found on that truck?\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:31.000\nI read the headline, but it was not big news.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:34.000\nIt was just all over the TVs.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:39.000\nI usually don't see TVs unless I'm in airports.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nWe kept debating.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nCody's like, what's a lorry?\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nIt's a bus.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nMaybe it's a truck, too.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:51.000\nBut it was like 38 bodies found on a lorry.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:56.000\nThis is a great time for Rob to be making light of things.\n\n39:56.000 --> 40:03.000\nJust a truck full of dead people.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:07.000\nObviously, a human trafficking thing.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:12.000\nOf course, human trafficking being a really horrible...\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:15.000\nOne of the worst atrocities in modern times.\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:20.000\nMany lives claim, say, every hour, two women are...\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nIt's probably...\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:27.000\nWhy are you applauding this?\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:31.000\nUsually dealing with some of the most vulnerable segments of our population.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:34.000\nYeah, there's probably more slaves living today,\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:38.000\nactive slaves than there have been at any point in history.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:41.000\nOh, so now it's not funny.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:46.000\nNow that there's not a candle, no one cares.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:49.000\nHere's something I think you'll find interesting.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nOkay, lay it on me.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:56.000\nWe're driving from the Oslo Airport to Frederikstad.\n\n40:56.000 --> 41:02.000\nAnd our driver, Odvar,\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:06.000\nwe said to him, you know, because it's Halloween at the time,\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:09.000\nwe were like, do you guys celebrate Halloween in Norway?\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:17.000\nAnd he said, we actually just started recently, about two years ago.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:20.000\nHow does that happen?\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nWhat kind of fucking...\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nWho was that?\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nHalloween just moved in?\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:30.000\nAre there any foreign holidays that we could start doing?\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:31.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:34.000\nYou guys ever heard of Sweetest Day?\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:35.000\nYeah.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:40.000\nThe guy who knows how tan bench, Rob knows about it.\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nSweetest Day.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:43.000\nSweetest Day.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:46.000\nSweetest Day is a holiday that's celebrated in the Midwest.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nI remember hearing about it.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:49.000\nIt's just made up.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nIt's one of these made up holidays.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:58.000\nOh, no, most of the holidays are natural laws passed down by the gods.\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:01.000\nNo, but it was just, it's called Sweetest Day to sell candy.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:04.000\nIt was conceived of by confectioners.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nThe first day is the sweetest.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:07.000\nWhoa.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nThank you.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nI wrote down this note.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:12.000\nI don't care if you don't laugh.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:15.000\nThat was funny for me.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nI wrote down, why am I always losing everything?\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:22.000\nBecause I thought I left my, because I did leave, I left my boarding pass from the, on\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:24.000\nthe connecting flight on the plane.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:25.000\nNo big deal.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:26.000\nI was able to just get another one.\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:29.000\nIt's just a boarding pass, like you're in the airport anyway, but like, I was like,\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:33.000\nI was like, God damn, it's like obviously something that I wouldn't choose to leave.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:34.000\nAnd I'm always doing that.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:37.000\nI'm always like leaving shit, you know, no matter how important it is.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:42.000\nAnd then on the next flight, on the one to Oslo, I was convinced I couldn't find my\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:44.000\nAirPods earbuds.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:46.000\nWhat the fuck are they called?\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:47.000\nAirPods?\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:50.000\nJesus Christ, Apple, get your shit together.\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nThey're coming out with the AirPod Pro.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:53.000\nOh, cool.\n\n42:53.000 --> 43:01.000\nI hope I can use those with my iPad 7th generation non-pro with second type of Apple pencil mini\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:02.000\nair.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:03.000\nFucking idiot.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:04.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\nSteve Jobs body isn't even cold.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nThey turned him to fucking Microsoft.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:09.000\nFucking idiots.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nThat Tim Apple's fucking everything up.\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:12.000\nYou'd think.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:15.000\nTim Apple.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:22.000\nYou'd think with a name like that, he'd like be ready for the job.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nBut I wrote this down.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:25.000\nYeah.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:26.000\nThis very lugubrious.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nWhy am I always losing everything?\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:31.000\nAnd when I look at it, I remember how I felt.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:36.000\nFuck man.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:37.000\nKeep going.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:38.000\nKeep going.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:41.000\nDo you want to talk about slavery real quick?\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:42.000\nSex trafficking.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:48.000\nI don't even like using the word pimp anymore because the proper term is sex trafficker.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:51.000\nIs that right?\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:52.000\nYeah.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nThat's what pimp stands for.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:55.000\nNo.\n\n43:55.000 --> 44:01.000\nBut it's like a sanitized version of what's actually happening.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:04.000\nBut I wrote down why am I always losing everything?\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:09.000\nBecause the reason I wrote it down is because I was really genuinely in the throes of this\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:13.000\nsort of tailspin, just because I lost this stupid Apple product.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nAnd then I was like, it wasn't like that was valuable to me.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:18.000\nIt was this idea of like, it's the ego hit.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:23.000\nIt was the fact that I could lose my boarding pass and then have that be such a center of attention.\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:27.000\nI'm so absent minded that I could leave my boarding pass on a plane and then got on another plane\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:32.000\nand then left something even more valuable in spite of having every incentive.\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:36.000\nIt sent me into such a depression because I was like, what is my fucking problem?\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:39.000\nWell, you also had a load of shit in your pants.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:40.000\nNo, I didn't.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:41.000\nThis was the trip out there.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nThat might have been a distracting factor.\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nNo, this was the trip out there.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:51.000\nBut then I found them in some pocket and it was like, oh, okay, I didn't lose my AirPods.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:52.000\nDid you look in the pocket?\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nShut up just for a second.\n\n44:54.000 --> 45:00.000\nAnd I was like, I don't know, there's something seemed profound about that because my mood was instantly lightened.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:03.000\nI was like so depressed and so self-loathing.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:06.000\nI was like, so you're such a piece of shit.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:07.000\nThere's something so wrong with you.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:11.000\nAnd then I was like, I'm fine.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nI don't even know what to call that.\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:14.000\nDo you have any pockets?\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nMaybe you have too many pockets.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:17.000\nThat's not the issue.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:21.000\nObviously, there's something more we could be achieving here.\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nLet's audit your pockets, though.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:24.000\nWhat?\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:25.000\nLet's audit his pockets.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nSee how many we're working with.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:31.000\nThe closest thing to me that you're talking about is like when I break my phone,\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nwhen I drop my phone and chatter the screen,\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:36.000\nI feel so existentially destroyed.\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nIt's like, what are you?\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:39.000\nYou can't have nice things.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:42.000\nWho the fuck do you think you are?\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:43.000\nYou know what?\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:48.000\nI think when I drop my phone and broke the screen,\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:51.000\nI think, oh, shit, I'm one of those people now.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:52.000\nYeah.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:53.000\nRight.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:54.000\nYeah.\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:57.000\nBefore, every time I saw somebody with a broken screen,\n\n45:57.000 --> 46:02.000\nI'd be like, come on, take care of your shit.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nAnd then crack.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:13.000\nYou got me again, God.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nHubris of man.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:20.000\nI was really appreciating all the iPhone 11 launch day memes.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:26.000\nPeople were exchanging a lot of animated gifts of like Apple about to press that button\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:29.000\nthat makes your iPhone 10 turn to shit or whatever.\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:33.000\nAnd then there's like a guy like putting on lipstick in the mirror and going,\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:34.000\nmm-hmm.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nIt was a lot of fun.\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:40.000\nIt's good when we can all get on the same page after a decade of servitude to a corporation.\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:41.000\nWe're like, you know what?\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:45.000\nI really do think they just push a button that makes like three generations of iPhone back.\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:46.000\nEverything just goes to shit.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nThey've got to be doing something, right?\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nI don't understand the meme.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:51.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:55.000\nI'd like to understand the meme.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:58.000\nWell, it's just it's just it doesn't matter what the meme is.\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:01.000\nThe meme could be like a scene from fucking office space or something.\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:02.000\nWho cares?\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:03.000\nWe got to be.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:04.000\nWe got to be.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:05.000\nWhat?\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nWhat's with the button?\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nIt breaks all the phones.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:10.000\nWe got to be.\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:13.000\nWe got to be brainstorming in this Memoji space.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:18.000\nThere's a lot of there's a lot of untapped like creative space on these Memoji's that\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:22.000\nwe haven't figured out, but you know, we could be the first ones to get there.\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:23.000\nWhat's a Memoji?\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:28.000\nThe Memoji is the animoji of your face that's built with your your facial features.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:33.000\nIt's a combination of a bit Moji and I don't have that that new a phone.\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:36.000\nIt's a very new space that we're very excited about.\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nYeah, I saw.\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:42.000\nI've seen you in like in my group text Spencer doing your cute little Spencer.\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:43.000\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:48.000\nThere's that's that's a whole new breed of content that someone's going to do like oh\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:52.000\nI could put my baby up to this thing and she goes poopy diaper and it's an elephant saying\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:53.000\nit and oh boy.\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:58.000\nBut if we figure out what that is and tap that market people will be fucking will be\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:02.000\nenshrined in the halls of Internet history will be the the new Viners.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:05.000\nTikTok will pay deference to us.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:06.000\nI don't know.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:09.000\nI don't know what the fuck you're talking about.\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:10.000\nThat's the point.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:11.000\nWe got to stay current.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:12.000\nI don't.\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:13.000\nWell, first you have to understand.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:16.000\nIt was three days ago that someone told me what baby shark was and I was like, what\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nthe fuck is going on?\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:22.000\nAnd now like I'm like, well, let me catch you up.\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:25.000\nTikTok is a platform famous for paying deference.\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:26.000\nRight.\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:27.000\nOh yeah.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nThere's so reverent those teens.\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:32.000\nIt's the differential treatment you get from TikTok is what you said.\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:33.000\nFor you.\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nYou you text Jeff a lot.\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nOh, I'm texting Jeff.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nI'm texting Dan.\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nI'm texting Steve.\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:44.000\nI'm texting Laura.\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:47.000\nI'm texting Zach.\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:53.000\nI'm texting Lolly, your dog.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:56.000\nSo I bought I bought this phone.\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:59.000\nI wrote one more emoji.\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:04.000\nI only got one more note in here, which is it was it was because Dina was making me think\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:08.000\nbecause I was talking about how scared I am that like, I don't know, like I listen to\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:15.000\nso much true crime and then I like, I just feel like, you know, like the Mark David Chapman,\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:22.000\nlike, like, like, like, like, we're getting crazier and crazier.\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nAnd then our crazier people are going to get crazier and stuff.\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:27.000\nBut then Dino always the contrarian.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nBut sometimes that's helpful when you're in a tailspin.\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:36.000\nIt was like, I don't know, maybe, maybe the internet's like, like a release for them.\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:39.000\nLike they don't have to like track you down and shoot you.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:43.000\nThey can fucking go on your Instagram and call you a fucking idiot.\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:47.000\nAnd, you know, like, feel like they did something.\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:51.000\nThat's an uplifting thought.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:55.000\nThese are all people that could shoot me.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:58.000\nI should stop blocking them.\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nYeah.\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nI'm cutting them off from.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:03.000\nYeah.\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:05.000\nI mean, I should delete my Instagram.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:06.000\nOr should I?\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:07.000\nOr will that get me shot?\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:08.000\nNo, don't do that.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nWhat will you broadcast your workouts on?\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:14.000\nWhen you meet somebody on Instagram, when you meet somebody, do they know that they've\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:15.000\nbeen muted?\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:16.000\nCan they tell anybody?\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:17.000\nI hope not.\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nWhen you meet someone on what?\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:20.000\nInstagram.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:21.000\nAn Instagram.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:22.000\nI don't know if there is.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:25.000\nThey don't post something and know that you don't give a fuck.\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:34.000\nAnd if you screenshot someone's story, do they know?\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nThat's an old Snapchat question.\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nBut I knew the answer to Snapchat.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nIt's a fun question.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:46.000\nSpencer, of those three books to your right, which is your favorite book of those three\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:47.000\nbooks?\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:48.000\nOkay.\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:55.000\nSo for the folks at home, the three books are Burt's Italian English and English Italian\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:56.000\nDictionary.\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:57.000\nAll right.\n\n50:57.000 --> 51:00.000\nSpencer, pick a title that speaks out to you, the one that you like the most.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:03.000\nWell, A Princess of Thule, or Tool, maybe?\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:04.000\nOkay.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:05.000\nTool.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:06.000\nAll right.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:07.000\nSo take that one.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:08.000\nOkay, man.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:09.000\nIs this a magic trick?\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:10.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:12.000\nCan I interject with something kind of fascinating here?\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:15.720\nBecause there were three books, and he picked A Princess of Thule, which means that one\n\n51:15.720 --> 51:19.880\nof those books, which is way thinner than the other, is either an Italian to English\n\n51:19.880 --> 51:23.000\nor a English to Italian, and one's way thicker.\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:24.000\nRight.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:28.000\nI'm just wondering which language is pitching and which is catching here.\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:33.000\nNo, the other book is Gallery Buffet Soup Cookbook.\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:34.000\nOkay.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:35.000\nOh.\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:36.000\nAll right.\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:37.000\nIs that a tool?\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:38.000\nYeah.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nHow many titles do these three books have?\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:41.000\nOkay.\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nI'm realizing that one of these books is just both.\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nThe dictionary is both ways.\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:46.000\nOh, okay.\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:50.000\nHere's something my friend Jenny Mack from Texas taught me.\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:51.000\nOh, I know.\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:52.000\nI met her.\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:53.000\nOh, yeah, you met Jenny.\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:54.000\nI met her there.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:55.000\nYou met her in Austin.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:56.000\nI know something.\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:57.000\nAll right.\n\n51:57.000 --> 52:00.000\nNow, you have this book.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:04.000\nAsk yourself kind of a philosophical question about yourself, like not like...\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:05.000\nOh, boy.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:09.000\nAsk yourself something about you, your future, your life, what you want, what you don't want,\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:10.000\nwhat you want to know about yourself.\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nAsk yourself that question, but don't tell anybody.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:13.000\nYeah, I did.\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:16.000\nHow many pages are in this book, Spencer?\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nOh, boy.\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:19.000\n462.\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:20.000\nOkay.\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:26.000\nPick a number between 10 and 460, and you pick that number first.\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:27.000\nMe personally?\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:28.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:29.000\nYou pick the number.\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:30.000\nOkay.\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:31.000\nYou got it?\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:32.000\nNo.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:33.000\nI got it.\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:34.000\nOkay.\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:35.000\n69.\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:36.000\n69.\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:37.000\nYou know, it's funny.\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:38.000\nIt's that one.\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:42.000\nBecause that's when people are looking at something.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:43.000\nOr doing things.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:44.000\nYeah, okay.\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nAt the same time, though, that's why it's funny.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:47.000\nIdeally...\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:52.000\nIf one person's doing it at the other person, that's serious shit.\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:53.000\nNobody wins.\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:54.000\nThis guy's eating my pussy.\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nOkay, so you've chosen...\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nOr I'm sucking this guy's dick.\n\n52:58.000 --> 52:59.000\nNo, I think it's different.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:00.000\nAt the same time.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:01.000\nWoo-hoo!\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:06.000\nSo you've chosen page 69 out of the princess of Phil.\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\nNo, I'd pick the different number.\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:09.000\nOkay, what is it?\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:10.000\n130.\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:11.000\n130.\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:12.000\nNow, let's say...\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:15.000\nHow many lines of, like, of print or any page?\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:16.000\nDiologue.\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:19.000\nLet's pick it up between 1 and 30.\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:20.000\nGay.\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:24.000\nI said gay, which is politically correct.\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nI thought you said gay.\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nI think a lot of people might have.\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:31.000\nPeople learned it out after five years of being woke.\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nIt's just erupting.\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:36.000\nLike, women shouldn't vote.\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:40.000\nUnless, to be honest, maybe I said that.\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nBut that wasn't the intent.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:45.000\nWell, A, B, C, D, E, F, J, K.\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:46.000\nSo, eight?\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:47.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:48.000\nThe number I picked was 15.\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:49.000\n15, okay.\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nNow, go to page 130, you said?\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:52.000\nYep.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:53.000\nWe're almost...\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nYou have the question in your mind, right?\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:56.000\nYou asked yourself.\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:57.000\nYes.\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nNow, go to that page.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:02.000\nThat line on that page is going to be the answer to that question.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nI don't know if it's the one I want, though.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:07.000\nWell, it's not up to you anymore, baby.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:08.000\nIt's up to...\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:09.000\nYeah, I mean...\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nWilliam, you lady.\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:14.000\nOkay, so page 130, line what?\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:15.000\n15 is what I said.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:16.000\nLine 15.\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:17.000\nOkay.\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nRead the line out and then...\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:20.000\nFill.\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:21.000\nFill.\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:22.000\nTime.\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nWhile I count the numbers.\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:25.000\nOh, oh, oh, okay.\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:28.000\nSorry, I could have done a lot better job communicating.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nI thought you were reading the square.\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:31.000\nNo, no, sorry.\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:32.000\nI'm so sorry.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nEverybody, this is the house.\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nCount the lines.\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:40.000\nThis is a song for that segment.\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:41.000\nYeah.\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:42.000\n14, 15.\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:43.000\nShush.\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:44.000\nNo, that's what I wanted.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nWait, what was the line?\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:49.000\nIs it a sentence or is it just a line of the page?\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nBecause, you know, a sentence can go multiple lines.\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:54.000\nYeah, but read like a part of that sentence or whatever.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:55.000\nIt jumps out of you.\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:56.000\nOkay.\n\n54:56.000 --> 55:00.000\nAnd in the evening too, when they had climbed to the top of the hills in the south of the\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:04.000\nstormaway harbor, did not the little town look sufficiently picturesque with its white\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:09.000\nhouses, its shipping, its castle and plantation lying in shadow under the green of the eastern\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:10.000\nsky.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:11.000\nThen away to the west.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nWhat a strange picture presented itself.\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:16.000\nThick bands of gray cloud lay across the sky.\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:23.000\nSo you kind of get the idea.\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:26.000\nBut now what was the now?\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:27.000\nWhat was your?\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:28.000\nWhat was your question?\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:31.000\nI don't want to say.\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:34.000\nBut should I move to Portland?\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:39.000\nYeah, it definitely wasn't a clear answer.\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:43.000\nMaybe it means Dan pick a book pick a book down.\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:47.000\nYeah, well now I got six for you now that it's a tried and true parlor game.\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nI mean do you want this one or several rounds?\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:50.000\nWhat book?\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:54.000\nThere are six books.\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:55.000\nIs that the Italian?\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:57.000\nNo, these ones we didn't even name off.\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:58.000\nOkay.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nWhere's that book called then?\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:04.000\nWell, this is what this might be fucked up.\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:08.000\nThis looks like a bunch of French or Latin or okay.\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:15.000\nIt says Le Morte fight fight book that appeals to you by Sir Thomas Mallory.\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:16.000\nHell yeah.\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:17.000\nI know that guy.\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:18.000\nOkay.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:19.000\nMallory never lets you down.\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nWhat's the what's the first instruction?\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:27.000\nYou ask yourself a philosophical question that you want to have the answer to.\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nBut don't reveal it to us yet.\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:30.000\nRight.\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:31.000\nWell, let me think about this first.\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:32.000\nPick a good.\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:33.000\nIt's kind of like Karnak.\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:37.000\nCan someone fill time?\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:42.000\nI'm the scat man.\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:50.000\nDole might is my name weekend.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:51.000\nIt's really fucking good.\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:52.000\nIt's great.\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:56.000\nSee people wrote Edward wrote the Dolomite bio pic.\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:58.000\nDo you think they did better?\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:02.000\nBut kind of like his up and coming what they do was that better than I think\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\nEdward is like a perfect movie.\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\nThis one's quite good though.\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:08.000\nI thought Eddie Murphy did a great job.\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:11.000\nBut Wesley Snipes was the fucking shit.\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:12.000\nOkay.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:13.000\nI got my.\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:14.000\nThat's part of the movie.\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:15.000\nOkay.\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:16.000\nOkay.\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:17.000\nGood job, Rob.\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:18.000\nFilling time.\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:20.000\nDan has his philosophical question and the book is titled.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:21.000\nWhat then?\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:26.000\nA little more on the inside cover because it's very hard to read.\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:27.000\nFuck.\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nHold on.\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:33.000\nEvery man's library edited by Ernest rise.\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:34.000\nNo, no.\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:35.000\nThat might be the collection.\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:36.000\nOkay.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:41.000\nLamort D'Arthur, the death of Arthur, I assume.\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:42.000\nArthur's death.\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:46.000\nWith an introduction by Professor rise in two volumes, volume one.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:47.000\nThis sounds good.\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:48.000\nOkay.\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:51.000\nI really knew what they were doing back then.\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:52.000\nCome on.\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:54.000\nJust call it Skyfall.\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:58.000\nSo pick a page in between like any page number.\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:00.000\nI don't know how long that book is.\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:01.000\nOkay.\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:02.000\nWait.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:03.000\nSorry.\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:07.000\nIt's a page number that falls within the beginning and the end of that book.\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:10.000\nShould I flip to the page or just stick a finger in it?\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:11.000\nNo, no.\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:12.000\nThink of a number.\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:13.000\nOkay.\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:14.000\nThink of a number.\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:15.000\nLet me look at how many pages.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:16.000\nIt looks like four hundred and one.\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:21.000\nSo I pick a number between ten and ten in the intro or whatever.\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:22.000\nOkay.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:23.000\nSo I'll go with...\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:24.000\nOkay.\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:25.000\nI got it.\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:26.000\nYou got it.\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:27.000\nWhat number?\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:28.000\n69.\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:29.000\n69.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:30.000\nIt's funny.\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:31.000\nIt's fucking funny.\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:32.000\nNow pick a number between...\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\nBetween one and let's say 24.\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nBecause I think that's how many...\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:39.000\nLet's ish the number of lines on the page.\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:40.000\nIt's on it.\n\n58:40.000 --> 58:41.000\nOkay.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:42.000\nPick a number between one and 24.\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:43.000\nTen.\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:44.000\nOkay.\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:45.000\nTen.\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:46.000\nSo what page number?\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:47.000\n69.\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:48.000\n69.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:49.000\nLine ten.\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:50.000\nOkay.\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:51.000\nNow I want you to read us.\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:52.000\nGo to that page.\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:53.000\nRead us that line.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nAnd you have the question still in your head, correct?\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:56.000\nYup, yup, yup.\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:57.000\nOkay.\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nThis is going to blow everybody's mind.\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nSpencer's was not so good.\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:04.000\nI think if we went with 69, it would have been a lot better.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:05.000\nLet's go back to that after that.\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:06.000\nOkay.\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:07.000\nWait, but did you ever tell us what your question was?\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:08.000\nNo, I didn't.\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:09.000\nI was embarrassed.\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:10.000\nOh, okay.\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:17.000\nI mean, yeah, in your defense, I knew from watching you that I needed to pick...\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:20.000\nI have philosophical questions that I don't want to share.\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:21.000\nRight.\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nAnd so I picked one that was worth sharing.\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:26.000\nWell, I'm glad to be, you know, take that bullet for you.\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:27.000\nYeah.\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:28.000\nThat's cool.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:29.000\nOkay.\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:36.000\nSo 69, line 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:37.000\nLet's get it out.\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nRead that line all the way through.\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:40.000\nOkay.\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:42.000\nWell, it's kind of, it's in the middle of a...\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:43.000\nYeah, that's what I had.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nThen use the whole sentence then.\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:46.000\nOkay.\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:57.000\nSo, Balan prayed the lady of her gentleness for his true service that she would bury\n\n59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nthem both in that same place where the battle was done.\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nI think that was my answer.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nSo now, can you say the question?\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nMy question was, should I give death weight in my life?\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nWhoa.\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nNow, read the question again.\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nNo, no, read the line again.\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nI did get a death-related sentence.\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nSo Balan, this is some proper name.\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nI'm sure.\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nIt sounds like a dwarf, I think.\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nSounds like it, yeah.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nPrayed, and not, it's prayed like hands together, like talking to God.\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nSo Balan prayed the lady of her gentleness, comma, which means, so he prayed the lady\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nof her gentleness.\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nMaybe that's a type of standardized prayer, maybe?\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nSay what?\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nHe saw it from her.\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nHe saw a prayer?\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nHe saw it from her.\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nDo you sound like you have an accent that means that you actually are credible in that?\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nOr are you just a foreign guy that's like, oh, no praying, you could pray on someone?\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nNo.\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nWe actually have Mallory right here.\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nPrayed the lady of her gentleness.\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nIs that a way to, I'm looking at.\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nOh, he begged her for gentleness, maybe?\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nCan you pray someone of, would that be like beseeching them of their, beseeching their\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000\ngentleness?\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nLike asking, was soliciting it?\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:34.500\nSo Balan prayed the lady of her gentleness, comma, for his true service, comma, that she\n\n01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:40.000\nwould bury them both in that same place where the battle was done.\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nSo, 9-11.\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000\n9-11.\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000\nAh.\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nThessalonians 9-11.\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nOh, fuck it, it's 9-11.\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nYou actually is 9-11.\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nBut I could interpret that to mean like.\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nWay to go Mallory.\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nYou know the phrase, don't shit where you eat?\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.500\nLike, you know, this is a character that is asking someone to bury him and someone else\n\n01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.600\nthat's important to him in the same place where they battled.\n\n01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.700\nSo the answer to my philosophical question would be, well fuck yeah, give death weight\n\n01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:14.200\nin your life.\n\n01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.200\nThat's what life is.\n\n01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:24.200\nLike pick out your cemetery plot while you're alive, put your estate in order, write your\n\n01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:27.400\nwill, pick your funeral plot.\n\n01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.000\nThat's not living outside the moment.\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.640\nThat's praying to the goddess to bury you where the battle was fought.\n\n01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.240\nPut me right here when I drop unexpectedly.\n\n01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.700\nSo the answer is yes, give it the amount of weight that it deserves, which is like, hey,\n\n01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:49.360\nwe were all here fighting it together and bury me on the battlefield.\n\n01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.800\nDon't bury me on the golf course.\n\n01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:58.560\nIs anybody here have a novel on them?\n\n01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.400\nIs anybody here carrying a book that's like fiction?\n\n01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.400\nI got five.\n\n01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.400\nYou raising your hand?\n\n01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.400\nYeah.\n\n01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400\nCould we grab it?\n\n01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400\nThis is for you, Rob.\n\n01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400\nI don't want to play.\n\n01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400\nYou got a...\n\n01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.800\nI want to be buried on this stage.\n\n01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.800\nI don't want to play.\n\n01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.560\nRob, you don't have to be afraid.\n\n01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:18.000\nThe president can't read.\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nIt's fine now.\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.520\nRob, I'll do all the work for you.\n\n01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.520\nThis is a book.\n\n01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.520\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.520\nZach Butcher.\n\n01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.520\nZach Butcher.\n\n01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:33.920\nThat is a guy, and I agree with him, that loves his name.\n\n01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:39.400\nBecause I always say Jeff when someone asks me my name, but if my full name was Zach Butcher,\n\n01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.600\nI would never just say Zach.\n\n01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600\nYeah.\n\n01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600\nThat's for sure.\n\n01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600\nYeah.\n\n01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600\nOkay.\n\n01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.600\nBecause it would be like being named Chad Huge Dick.\n\n01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.600\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.600\nChad Huge Dick is right.\n\n01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.600\nChad Scientist.\n\n01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.600\nYes, sir.\n\n01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.600\nBecause you'd be like, Chad, wait for it.\n\n01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.880\nOkay, Rob, I'll do all the heavy lifting, Rob.\n\n01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.600\nAll you have to do is ask yourself a philosophical question.\n\n01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.600\nDon't have any.\n\n01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.000\nIt could be about you or Dan or me or anybody else.\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nI don't have any.\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nYeah, you do.\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nI don't have any.\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nI don't even have any.\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nI don't have any.\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nI don't have any.\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nYou fucking do.\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nYeah, you do.\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nIt's about directing.\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nI don't, I don't really.\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nRob, ask.\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nI don't want to be forced to play this.\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nOh, come on.\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nI've been thinking just a minute.\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nOh, brother.\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nYou love games.\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nThis guy loves his games.\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nHe's playing games right now.\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nI would never ask to be a part of this, and now I'm ruining the show.\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nIt's not a game if you can't lose.\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nLike, wait, wait.\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nOh, he can lose.\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nI just want to watch.\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nI don't want to be.\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.520\nWhy do I have to do it?\n\n01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.320\nWe'll just do a question.\n\n01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.320\nYou don't have to do it, Rob.\n\n01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.320\nSo if I say you pick a color, you won't pick a color\n\n01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.200\nbecause someone's making you do something.\n\n01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.120\nIt's like a game.\n\n01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:51.820\nRight?\n\n01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:55.320\nYou won't pick a color.\n\n01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.720\nBecause there's always men on stage, who's a woman here\n\n01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.920\nthat wants a question answered in her life?\n\n01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.600\nThat's better.\n\n01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.320\nThere's people.\n\n01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:02.920\nThat's so much better.\n\n01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.720\nYou can matter right here.\n\n01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.240\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.240\nReally?\n\n01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:05.720\nAlicia.\n\n01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.960\nWelcome, Alicia, to the stage.\n\n01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960\nAlicia, come on up

are you ready to play this game?\n\n01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:19.720\nI'm ready.\n\n01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.800\nOK, here's the deal.\n\n01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.080\nHello.\n\n01:05:21.080 -->

pretty respectful.\n\n01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.200\nNo.\n\n01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.440\nPretty respectful.\n\n01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.760\nLike, for the being forced on spotlight.\n\n01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.840\nThe fucking prime minister of respect.\n\n01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.200\nAnd did you see this guy?\n\n01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.480\nGot the robe.\n\n01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.920\nDid you see the movie, Alicia?\n\n01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.800\nOh, with Matt Damon?\n\n01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.600\nYeah.\n\n01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.120\nNo.\n\n01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.600\nOK, it was bad.\n\n01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.840\nWas it Alicia?\n\n01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.560\nNo.\n\n01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.240\nYeah.\n\n01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.040\nOh,

01:05:57.520\nSee?\n\n01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.680\nYou raised your hand because you want some sort\n\n01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.960\nof philosophical question answered in your life.\n\n01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.920\nI'm seeking wisdom.\n\n01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.160\nThat's within that book.\n\n01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.600\nAre we sure that microphone might not be on?\n\n01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.280\nLet's turn this mic on with some applause.\n\n01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.280\nIs there a switch on?\n\n01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:12.780\nTry it.\n\n01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:13.280\nSo.\n\n01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.080\nIs there a switch on?\n\n01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:15.600\nHello.\n\n01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.680\nThere you go.\n\n01:06:16.680 -->

01:06:21.160\nThere you are.\n\n01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.840\nWell, she was eating it plenty, but it wasn't on.\n\n01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.160\nNot eating it.\n\n01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.640\nOK, Alicia.\n\n01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.240\nThis could be like a game show.\n\n01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.440\nDo you have the question ready in your mind?\n\n01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.640\nDo you want to think about it for a moment?\n\n01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.560\nI'm ready.\n\n01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.440\nYou got it.\n\n01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:32.720\nReady.\n\n01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.440\nAll right, keep it to yourself for a second.\n\n01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:38.880\nThis is a book that Zach Butcher gave us.\n\n01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.120\nAnd it is by the author Dan Simmons.\n\n01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.400\nAnd it's called The Rise of Endymion,\n\n01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.080\nif I'm saying that correctly.\n\n01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.960\nSure.\n\n01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.640\nI'm almost certain that Wootch was by one Zach Butcher.\n\n01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.080\nSomeone fucking loves Endymion.\n\n01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:52.920\nI don't know if it was.\n\n01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.720\nI really don't know.\n\n01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.960\nIt wasn't.\n\n01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.840\nWas it Zach Butcher or not?\n\n01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.560\nNo.\n\n01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.280\nOK.\n\n01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.840\nThis book goes all the way to, let's call it, seven 108 pages\n\n01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.920\nand starts around page five.\n\n01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:09.480\nSo between five and seven 108, pick a number.\n\n01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:09.920\nYou got it?\n\n01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.680\nGot

funny too.\n\n01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.080\nThat's like the 69 of the occult.\n\n01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.280\nHell yeah.\n\n01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:23.880\nAccurate, Dan.\n\n01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:29.600\nThat's like if the devil was eating leprechaun's pussy\n\n01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:33.040\nwell, the leprechaun fucking ate his ass.\n\n01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.120\nA goblin.\n\n01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:35.320\nThat's what it means.\n\n01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:35.920\nIt's fun.\n\n01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.240\nAnd if they did it on 420.\n\n01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.520\nYep.\n\n01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.280\nThe hijink.\n\n01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.760\nSo from The Rise of Endymion, am I saying that correctly?\n\n01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.240\nZach Butcher?\n\n01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.960\nEndymion.\n\n01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.760\nThere's got to be at least 30 lines or more.\n\n01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.880\nPick a line on the page.\n\n01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.640\n27.\n\n01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.680\nOh.\n\n01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.080\nThat's going to take a while to get there.\n\n01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.680\nEverybody says that the Scatman stutters,\n\n01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:04.400\nbut doesn't ever stutter when he sings.\n\n01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.520\nWatch it out.\n\n01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.640\nI'm going to tell you, the stutter and the scat\n\n01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.800\nis the same for you.\n\n01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.880\nI'm the Scatman.\n\n01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.200\nI'm the Scatman.\n\n01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.160\nI used to love the Scatman.\n\n01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.320\nOK, so Alicia.\n\n01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:22.960\nYes,

movie.\n\n01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:28.800\nLike the Lyceum.\n\n01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.480\nThat is correct.\n\n01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.320\nOh, Lyceum.\n\n01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.640\nWell, from Endymion.\n\n01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.280\nHere we go.\n\n01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.800\nSo you have a question in your mind.\n\n01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.360\nShow me that text.\n\n01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.200\nI have my question.\n\n01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.600\nYou chose in line 27, page 666 from Dan Simmons,\n\n01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:40.800\nThe Rise of Endymions.\n\n01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.200\nAnd then it goes like this, Rob.\n\n01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.400\nAnd then I remembered that the one reason to be free,\n\n01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.760\nthe one person who would make such freedom worthwhile,\n\n01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.520\nwas gone.\n\n01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.320\nShit.\n\n01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.080\nHoly shit.\n\n01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.000\nHoly shit.\n\n01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.120\nAnd the question was?\n\n01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.880\nShould we relocate our life from California\n\n01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.640\nto another part of the country?\n\n01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.680\nAnd you would because it was gone, right?\n\n01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.200\nIt was gone to the other side of the country.\n\n01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.480\nIt kind of sounds like I'm alone if I do this.\n\n01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.440\nYeah, right.\n\n01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:19.960\nThat's true.\n\n01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.200\nBut the one reason to be free,\n\n01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.040\nthe one person who would make such freedom worthwhile.\n\n01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.080\nMy husband.\n\n01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.200\nOh, shit.\n\n01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:26.880\nOh, no.\n\n01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.160\nWe just killed your husband.\n\n01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.120\nThat's the albino, you know.\n\n01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.800\nIs your husband the famous albino?\n\n01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.280\nI guess.\n\n01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:33.840\nYeah.\n\n01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.160\nThat's not how it works.\n\n01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.920\nBut we're not leaving her going home,\n\n01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:37.600\nempty-handed.\n\n01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.800\nWell, you could interpret it as a.\n\n01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.640\nAlicia.\n\n01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640\nYou get this novel.\n\n01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.520\nStation Plague.\n\n01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:48.120\nYou get Zach Butcher's copy of Dan Simmons, The Rise of Endymions.\n\n01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.480\nThank you, Zach Butcher.\n\n01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.000\nAlong with two ice cubes.\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.440\nSorry, Zach.\n\n01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.360\nShe's got your fucking book now.\n\n01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.160\nNo, they're not.\n\n01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.720\nThey're actually quite comfortable.\n\n01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.760\nThank you, Alicia.\n\n01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.880\nLet's give it up for Alicia.\n\n01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.920\nThank you so much, madam.\n\n01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.880\nIf I was thinking about whether to change locations\n\n01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.400\nwith my partner, and then that was the answer,\n\n01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.760\nas cloudy as it is, I would focus on the idea\n\n01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.800\nthat what that passage is saying is,\n\n01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:20.160\nas unsatisfying as the answer might be,\n\n01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:27.080\nyou relocate or don't just stick with this person.\n\n01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:30.040\nJust make sure it's what you both want to do.\n\n01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.600\nBecause as long as you're with him,\n\n01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.760\nyou can't pick a wrong place.\n\n01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.760\nRight.\n\n01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.240\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:44.120\nUnless it's a very sunny place, because he'll get skin cancer.\n\n01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:53.280\nHell, yeah.\n\n01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.680\nMore like the walk of fame, you know what I'm saying?\n\n01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.400\nHell, yeah.\n\n01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.120\nI had a dream the other night where\n\n01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.480\nI kept pulling pine needles and pine branches out of my mouth.\n\n01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.600\nLike, I ate a fucking Christmas tree.\n\n01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.920\nAnd then last night, I had a dream\n\n01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.200\nwhere I kept pulling glass shards out of my mouth.\n\n01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.760\nLike, my teeth were punched crystals.\n\n01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.400\nI had a dream last night.\n\n01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.240\nI was going to the bathroom.\n\n01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.640\nI was peeing, standing up.\n\n01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.880\nThat was no dream.\n\n01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:23.720\nAnd there were like bullet holes in the toilet.\n\n01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.120\nAnd I was like, where are all these bullet holes doing\n\n01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:26.840\nin the toilet?\n\n01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.480\nAnd a guy came in and shot me.\n\n01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.760\nAnd as I was dying in the dream, I said,\n\n01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.680\nwhy don't I just jump out the window?\n\n01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:40.520\nI woke up.\n\n01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.320\nI just remembered a crazy dream\n\n01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:47.720\nI had on one of the flights, which was, yeah,\n\n01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.960\nit was a fucking insane, like super vivid, weird.\n\n01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:57.040\nThere were these dolls.\n\n01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.600\nI was trying to construct.\n\n01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:04.000\nAnd when they were completed, they\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.480\nhad the ability to generate these portals out of their face\n\n01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.800\nthat were like these hula hoops in space\n\n01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.720\nthat would like come out of their mouths\n\n01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.040\nand then be in space in front of them.\n\n01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.880\nAnd if you put your head through the hula hoop,\n\n01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.560\nyou were like in a different world.\n\n01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.720\nAnd it was really freaky.\n\n01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.440\nAnd I started to realize all too late\n\n01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:35.960\nthat the dolls were part of some race of things\n\n01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.200\nthat wanted me to finish the dolls\n\n01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.800\nso that they could take over.\n\n01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:44.120\nAnd some kind of thing of a gateway to break up\n\n01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.120\nMorty season five.\n\n01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.520\nI just remember running from them with Cody.\n\n01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.440\nAnd then there was these guys that\n\n01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.720\nwere agents of these dolls or something.\n\n01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.480\nThat's so fucking cool.\n\n01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.000\nWhen you dream a lot, is Cody usually there?\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.240\nCody's in my dreams a lot.\n\n01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.200\nBut I really typically do not.\n\n01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.240\nI mean, when people say you dream for sure every night,\n\n01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.520\nbut then there's a question of what you remember.\n\n01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.680\nBut let's just say, if remembering your dreams\n\n01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.680\nis what we call dreaming, I really don't have,\n\n01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.760\nI don't really don't dream a lot.\n\n01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.720\nBut when I do, I have these super vivid dreams.\n\n01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.520\nI shared on this podcast this crazy dream\n\n01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.880\nI had that was where it was literally dreaming\n\n01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.360\nwithin dreaming and in the dream waking up.\n\n01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.840\nAnd I talked about that here.\n\n01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.880\nAnd it was in a different house.\n\n01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.160\nBut it was also a new house that I was sharing with Cody\n\n01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.520\nthat was also unfurnished.\n\n01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.840\nAnd then in the dream, the scary shit happened\n\n01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.240\nas I heard a noise and walked out of there,\n\n01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.400\nsome scary shit happened.\n\n01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:48.400\nAnd then in the dream, which I did not know was a dream,\n\n01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.600\nI fucking woke up in bed with Cody in a new house.\n\n01:13:53.600 --> 01:14:00.240\nAnd just in the movies when they do these mislead dreams,\n\n01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.400\nit was like, Cody was like, are you all right?\n\n01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.560\nAnd I was like, yeah, I just had this crazy nightmare.\n\n01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.920\nTalked to her about it, started laying back down.\n\n01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.960\nHeard a noise and walked and explored it.\n\n01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:17.320\nAnd then I fucking woke up in what I assume is real life.\n\n01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.080\nBut now can never really know.\n\n01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.680\nIt may as well not be.\n\n01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.080\nBecause what are the rules here?\n\n01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.960\nThis could be a fucking dream.\n\n01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.600\nDo your dogs ever dream?\n\n01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.560\nDo you ever catch your dogs dreaming?\n\n01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.120\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.640\nNigel is like, Nigel does not sleep without it at some point.\n\n01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.960\nAnd I go, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.\n\n01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.520\nI always like, butoring between.\n\n01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.160\nYou look at a dog, they sound distressed when they're\n\n01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.400\nmaking noises in their sleep.\n\n01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.320\nBut then again, you're kind of like,\n\n01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.200\nhow would you know if a dog was having the time of their life\n\n01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.360\nin a dream?\n\n01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.120\nBecause my instinct is like, let them know it's OK.\n\n01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:55.960\nWake them up.\n\n01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.200\nLike, hey, it's all right.\n\n01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.600\nBecause you assume that they're running from something\n\n01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.120\nin their dream.\n\n01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.160\nBut what if they're chasing something?\n\n01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.760\nThose are the two modes of dog, right?\n\n01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.760\nYeah.\n\n01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.760\nLike, you don't want to take that away from them\n\n01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:12.160\nif they're about to catch an ostrich with a fire hydrant\n\n01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.080\nfor a head or whatever.\n\n01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:13.840\nGary Larson.\n\n01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.360\nYeah, what do they dream about?\n\n01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.200\nDo they dream about taking a nap?\n\n01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.280\nI mean, what do they do all day?\n\n01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.920\nRemember that Gary Larson cartoon where the dog is dreaming\n\n01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.800\nand the dog is on top of an overturned car?\n\n01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.800\nAnd he's like howling in victory.\n\n01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.800\nHe caught a car.\n\n01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:38.680\nAnd in that Gary Larson book, the Farside Natural History\n\n01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.560\nbook, he goes into all this detail\n\n01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.800\nabout how it's just a whole section about times\n\n01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.840\nhis cartoons that caused an uproar.\n\n01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.200\nAnd that was one of them.\n\n01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.440\nBecause the way he drew it, there's\n\n01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:53.200\njust a certain percentage of people saw that cartoon\n\n01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.800\nand thought the dog was fucking the car.\n\n01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.480\nAnd he's just like, I mean, there's\n\n01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.360\na part of the car that, I guess, is\n\n01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.440\nlike tangential to the dog's pelvis.\n\n01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.000\nBut it's like, why would the car have a vagina?\n\n01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.440\nWhy would they think that the dog, that the reason dogs chase\n\n01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.200\ncars?\n\n01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.360\nAnd why would they think those people woke up in a world\n\n01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:23.960\nwhere, lest they're vigilant enough,\n\n01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.640\nthe guy who created the Farside might just every once\n\n01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.200\nin a while on Sunday morning treat your family\n\n01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.840\nto an image of a dog fucking a car.\n\n01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:39.280\nUnless you, Joe Q. Citizen, are on your shit\n\n01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.760\nwith your pen ready to go and your stamps ready to lick\n\n01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.320\nto the local paper, that's what.\n\n01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.800\nDo you remember the beef that he got?\n\n01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.000\nRemember cow tools?\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.720\nThere was a cow with like a blacksmith's apron on.\n\n01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.120\nAnd a cow standing upright on two legs.\n\n01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.080\nAnd it was standing in front of like a table.\n\n01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:02.240\nAnd there was this really weird kind of oblong,\n\n01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.680\nmisshapen, like, you don't know what they are.\n\n01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.200\nAnd it's just like four or three things.\n\n01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.360\nAnd I said, cow tools.\n\n01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.840\nAnd people were all fucked off about that.\n\n01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.000\nBecause they didn't get it.\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:13.800\nThey didn't like it.\n\n01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:14.760\nThey were mad about it.\n\n01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.200\nAnd he had to write it or try it.\n\n01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.160\nHe goes, cows don't make good tools.\n\n01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.360\nBut they thought, didn't they think like they were like dildos\n\n01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.640\nand stuff or something?\n\n01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.000\nPeople, it was inflammatory.\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:25.960\nIt was really good.\n\n01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.160\nIt's funny, I said like dumb people.\n\n01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.240\nThey live in this world, like this beautiful world,\n\n01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:35.360\nwhere like they're the only smart ones.\n\n01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.360\nAnd they're the only ones that care.\n\n01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.480\nBut it's the opposite.\n\n01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.880\nThey're the only ones that don't care.\n\n01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.120\nAnd they don't know anything.\n\n01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.120\nSo they really get on the freeway.\n\n01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.440\nThey're just like, bleh, bleh.\n\n01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.560\nAnd everyone's like, bleh, bleh.\n\n01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.880\nAnd they're like, you idiots.\n\n01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.320\nAnd then they just see something that offends them\n\n01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.320\nif they don't get the joke.\n\n01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.520\nAnd they're like, instead of saying, I don't get it,\n\n01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.320\nthey're just like, that's a terrible joke.\n\n01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.120\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.760\nYou're going to fuck that guy.\n\n01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.040\nI really feel like the hate mail that Gary Larson got\n\n01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.880\nfor Couchells was like people thought they took personal\n\n01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.520\noffense to it.\n\n01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.520\nAnd I don't know what that's based on.\n\n01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.960\nBecause it's just a drawing or something\n\n01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.800\nthat looks like kind of like a baby's rattle\n\n01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.560\nwith a little thing on it.\n\n01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.040\nYeah.\n\n01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.920\nIt just like, it's really.\n\n01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:14.720\nI just looked at it.\n\n01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.400\nIt was really good.\n\n01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.840\nThere's like a saw that looks like it's made out of brand\n\n01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:21.600\nor something.\n\n01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.880\nIt's the funniest joke about that.\n\n01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.840\nIt's really funny.\n\n01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.680\nI love bad jokes, but there's certain jokes\n\n01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:31.080\nthat you can only tell people that like anti-humor.\n\n01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:34.440\nAnd that's a really anti-joke joke.\n\n01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.720\nLike the guy who's half his head's a pumpkin.\n\n01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.240\nThat's a joke that people only laugh at if you like comedy.\n\n01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.800\nAnd also know that the rules can be broken\n\n01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.800\nfor the sake of comedy.\n\n01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.080\nYeah.\n\n01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.640\nI think we talked about that book before on this podcast.\n\n01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.680\nBut what are you going to do to cancel me?\n\n01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.560\nThere's five episodes left.\n\n01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.760\nBut the other section of that book that's great\n\n01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.760\nis the handful of times that for some reason,\n\n01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.200\nwhenever there was a mistake, it would\n\n01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.920\nbe the Far Side's captions getting\n\n01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.680\nswapped with the family circus.\n\n01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.160\nYeah.\n\n01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.400\nIt's so like Billy's walking up to his mom\n\n01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.000\nand saying what a caveman fortune teller is\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.920\nsupposed to be saying to a caveman, which is Billy looking up\n\n01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.360\nat his mom and saying, I see your skull on a shelf\n\n01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.600\nin an anthropologist's office.\n\n01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.880\nThat really happened?\n\n01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.400\nYeah.\n\n01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.960\nOh, awesome.\n\n01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.840\nFamily circus is a fucking freak out.\n\n01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.840\nWhen I used to work at Disneyland doing a sketch show,\n\n01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.280\nor I used to play a drag character in Frontierland,\n\n01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.440\nwe would take Family Circus every day\n\n01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.440\nand then tear off the caption and then write our own caption.\n\n01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.760\nAnd it was the funniest thing in the world.\n\n01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.280\nIt's always funnier because nothing\n\n01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:50.160\nhappens in Family Circus except just oblique sadness.\n\n01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.240\nThat was my first time taking acid\n\n01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.800\nwhen the acid chip was winding down, which is also\n\n01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.240\nthose sometimes when you get really punchy.\n\n01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.160\nAcid could be more like, oh my god, whoa, yeah.\n\n01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.200\nAnd not totally like giggles and stuff,\n\n01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.680\nbut then as the acid tapers off.\n\n01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:09.040\nAs I remember in my youth, I haven't done a ton of acid\n\n01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.920\nexcept in my youth, but it tapers off\n\n01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:15.520\ninto a kind of almost mushroomy kind of giggly thing.\n\n01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.440\nAnd I just remember the sun coming through the windows\n\n01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.840\nand listening to music.\n\n01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.120\nAnd for some reason, I had this giant stack\n\n01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.920\nof Milwaukee journals.\n\n01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.240\nAnd we were just going through every Family Circus on acid\n\n01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.480\nlooking at every single one.\n\n01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.680\nI'd be like, wait, it was insane.\n\n01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.640\nThat cartoon is really insane if you're on acid.\n\n01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.960\nWhat's this dolled line doing, man?\n\n01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.280\nWhy do we care where this kid has been?\n\n01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:47.680\nHow many goddamn times are they going to take this big Family\n\n01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.080\nCircus and they show you where the kid was all day?\n\n01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.680\nOh, man, he went over the fence twice.\n\n01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.920\nThe little kid was named Jeffrey.\n\n01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.320\nSo people would always send me things saying like,\n\n01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.280\nJeffrey totaled.\n\n01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:00.520\nThere's one, it's so fucking abstract and like, it's not funny.\n\n01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:05.000\nI don't know the point of view, like what the fuck is going on.\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.800\nAnd mommy, Jeffrey totaled his tricycle.\n\n01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.600\nAnd it was Jeffrey crying with a tricycle on its side.\n\n01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.760\nBecause apparently, like, totaling your car\n\n01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.760\nwas a new phrase back in 1978.\n\n01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:20.000\nSo it was kind of like, yeah.\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.840\nYeah, and it's like, oh, that's, I don't get it.\n\n01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:28.640\nBut I thought Garfield was good and funny, but guess what?\n\n01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.480\nNope.\n\n01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.560\nYou were wrong.\n\n01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.520\nYeah, I'm in that boat, yeah.\n\n01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.080\nI mean, I had Garfield notebooks, backpacks.\n\n01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.040\nI was like, Garfield's the best.\n\n01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.960\nAnd then you look back and you're like, what happened there?\n\n01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.120\nIt was like the war on drugs.\n\n01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.920\nWe just all bought it.\n\n01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:47.400\nThis cat's so fat.\n\n01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.200\nAt the age of seven years old, I never considered\n\n01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:54.000\nwhether or not I would or would not do Mondays.\n\n01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.480\nI guess it was just like we hadn't seen a cat portrayed\n\n01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:07.560\nas so selfishly like no cats could be so solipsistic.\n\n01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.760\nGo back to the annals of Garfield and watch his feet grow.\n\n01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.840\nBecause by the end of the current Garfield,\n\n01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:19.680\nhis feet are like 42 inches long.\n\n01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.600\nAnd he has parts of a cat that cats don't have.\n\n01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.640\nIt's all fucked up.\n\n01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.480\nParts that a cat doesn't have?\n\n01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:31.440\nYeah, but he has like a flimbus.\n\n01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.720\nI don't know, eyebrows?\n\n01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.040\nIt's a shitty drawing of a cat.\n\n01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.880\nSnoopy doesn't look much like a dog,\n\n01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.080\nbut he's still recognizable as a dog.\n\n01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.720\nSnoopy looks like an abomination.\n\n01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.720\nCharlie Brown doesn't look like a human being.\n\n01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.360\nCharlie Brown looks like a member of Congress.\n\n01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:52.040\nLike he is a...\n\n01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:53.920\nGod damn it, I bought a spider house.\n\n01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.720\nI suppose we were fucking spiders in my house.\n\n01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.280\nWhat is going on?\n\n01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.880\nIt got away, Cody, send me a picture of this giant spider.\n\n01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:02.800\nWhy are we away?\n\n01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.440\nI hope we dropped the ad in there.\n\n01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.880\nYeah, we got to put the ad there.\n\n01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.200\nDettelbell Kitchen.\n\n01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.400\nI said, did you kill it?\n\n01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.880\nShe said, it got away.\n\n01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:13.840\nIt ran.\n\n01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.600\nNow it knows.\n\n01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:18.120\nNow it knows what you look like and your intentions.\n\n01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.880\nIt's teaching itself how to learn, Dan.\n\n01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.400\nI smashed it a little so it's possible injured,\n\n01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.680\nbut it's gone.\n\n01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:31.280\nIf you can smash a spider and it runs away...\n\n01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:31.960\nThat happened.\n\n01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.720\nI told you about the spider that pulled out of my ear\n\n01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.840\nand I stepped on it as hard as I could.\n\n01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:38.960\nAnd the spider went, whew, and ran boned out.\n\n01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.840\nStepping on spiders is not a good plan.\n\n01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.280\nLike spiders don't give a shit about your foot,\n\n01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:45.600\nbut they don't care about mass and energy.\n\n01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.920\nI tried to smoke it out from under the nightstand\n\n01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.800\nwith Palo Santo.\n\n01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.240\nHell yeah.\n\n01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.080\nThey like that.\n\n01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.920\nWhat a valley girl.\n\n01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.080\nShe tried to smoke it out from under the nightstand.\n\n01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.600\nI...\n\n01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.680\nThere's all these mosquitoes.\n\n01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:04.920\nSo you know there's this new breed of mosquito in LA\n\n01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.760\nthat only needs a teacup of water to have a million babies\n\n01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.440\nand they're smart and they only bite your ankles\n\n01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.880\nbecause they understand.\n\n01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.440\nThese things are all over my house.\n\n01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.760\nYou know about these new mosquitoes?\n\n01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.360\nNo, what about the new mosquitoes?\n\n01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.360\nYou still fucked off when we tried to make you look\n\n01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.560\nat a book or something like that.\n\n01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.800\nBut so quiet you've just been fuming over there.\n\n01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:26.280\nWhat?\n\n01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:30.160\nThe last thing you said was red.\n\n01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.160\nI think it's just like sitting there like, I'm gonna fucking\n\n01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:35.360\nkill you and you're asleep.\n\n01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.280\nYou know the thing with those new mosquitoes?\n\n01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.840\nI was listening to the Garfield story.\n\n01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.520\nEvery time the new mosquitoes come out,\n\n01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.520\nthe old ones stop working.\n\n01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.120\nThe old ones stop working.\n\n01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:52.280\nWe'll be right back.\n\n01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.920\nWelcome back to Harmontown.\n\n01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.520\nDid they really turn off old phones?\n\n01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.360\nThey stopped working.\n\n01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.680\nObviously, they won't admit it.\n\n01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.480\nBut it just seems uncanny when the new phones are coming out.\n\n01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:06.160\nDoesn't your old shit start getting all glitchy?\n\n01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.680\nThey did find some sort of thing.\n\n01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:09.520\nLike, it's not.\n\n01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.600\nI don't think it was pronounced.\n\n01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.640\nThey said they did.\n\n01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.880\nBecause every time there's a new iPhone, my speaker,\n\n01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.720\nI can't hear.\n\n01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.880\nLike, it instantly goes out.\n\n01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.840\nThat's just age.\n\n01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:19.840\nThat's just age.\n\n01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:32.320\nI've got more Garfield stories.\n\n01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.640\nThat guy used to look different than he does now.\n\n01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:39.240\nHe used to be like a big, fat, weird thing.\n\n01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:44.600\nWhen they started leasing phones, I was like, come on, man.\n\n01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.960\nThat's my hot take.\n\n01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.720\nThe thing I'm going to miss most about Harmontown\n\n01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:55.880\nis the trenchant commentary on social life like that.\n\n01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:59.640\nI like the hand gesture that the listeners at home won't see.\n\n01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:00.600\nSo many fucking spiders.\n\n01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.480\nThey should have called it spider house.\n\n01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.480\nBecause there's one spider house?\n\n01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:11.960\nDo you have $3 million and no spiders?\n\n01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.120\nLet us solve both of your problems.\n\n01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:17.240\nHave $0 and 3 million spiders.\n\n01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.920\nHi, I'm Bob Spider.\n\n01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:19.920\nRealtor.\n\n01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:28.280\nDo you want the convenience of living in a spider's nest\n\n01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:31.400\nwithout having to be a spider?\n\n01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:36.680\nCome on down to this fucking hacienda.\n\n01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.760\nHow many spiders have you seen?\n\n01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.720\nAt least six.\n\n01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.320\nHow many rooms do you have?\n\n01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.760\nAt least seven.\n\n01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.080\nYou know, I've seen a bunch of seven rooms.\n\n01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.520\nI've been cruising around that house since before Furniture One\n\n01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.040\nshowed up.\n\n01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.320\nAnd there's just been, I clocked at least 20, 30 spiders\n\n01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.600\nin the back of those times.\n\n01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:58.960\nAnd these are probably new spiders.\n\n01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.000\nThis is probably generation six or seven.\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.240\nAnd while we're complaining about stuff,\n\n01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:10.320\nmy old house in Los Feliz, I went over there recently.\n\n01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.160\nThere's rat turds all over the basement.\n\n01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:13.960\nOh, shit.\n\n01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:14.480\nYeah.\n\n01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.200\nLiterally.\n\n01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.800\nBecause I went over there to throw out my sex doll.\n\n01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.600\nAnd they were fucking like, that basement\n\n01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.320\nhas been a party for so many years.\n\n01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.320\nYou still have the real doll from way back.\n\n01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.720\nNo, he threw it out.\n\n01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:28.960\nNot anymore, brother.\n\n01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.840\nBut you bought that a long, long time ago.\n\n01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.640\nYeah.\n\n01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.520\nHow did you dispose of that, just in a dumpster or what?\n\n01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.280\nCalled Levy.\n\n01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.840\nYou want to ask Levy what he did?\n\n01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.560\nDo you want to ask him?\n\n01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.680\nLet's bring out Steve Levy to find out the answer to that\n\n01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.180\nquestion.\n\n01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.000\nHello.\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.640\nThanks, everybody.\n\n01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.240\nOh, remember last episode, we were talking about your quote,\n\n01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.480\nunquote, Jewfro.\n\n01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.680\nYeah, that's a way.\n\n01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.240\nSelf-applied.\n\n01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.040\nI wouldn't be so anti-Semitic.\n\n01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.480\nYeah, no, no, yeah.\n\n01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.840\nI said that a regular fro.\n\n01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.400\nYou applied your Jewfro?\n\n01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.640\nI applied for a Jewfro.\n\n01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:23.000\nLet me know how I go.\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.200\nThose are on backwards.\n\n01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.480\nYou look a little bit like A-Rod now.\n\n01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.280\nYeah, that's true.\n\n01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.760\nHe's roiding, too.\n\n01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.720\nAre you roiding?\n\n01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.360\nI didn't ask for this.\n\n01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:36.280\nI kind of just go to a guy, and he just goes, you know?\n\n01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:38.560\nBut it's just like, all right.\n\n01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.240\nI'm just like, yeah, just make it shorter.\n\n01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.480\nAnd then it's like, every time it's\n\n01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.200\na different work of art for him, he's a hair artist.\n\n01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:45.760\nI don't know.\n\n01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.400\nThat's what he considers himself, right?\n\n01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.480\nSure.\n\n01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:51.360\nBut I saw Waldron this morning, and he was like,\n\n01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.720\nnice Richard Spencer.\n\n01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:56.560\nAnd I was like, fuck, fuck Richard Spencer.\n\n01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:57.760\nI mean, what does he look like?\n\n01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.720\nHe just looks like something like me.\n\n01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.920\nApparently, he's got a haircut like this.\n\n01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.160\nWell, I mean, you know.\n\n01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.400\nLook.\n\n01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.960\nAnyway, well, all right, so I leave\n\n01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:13.760\nhe's no longer my assistant, he's now an executive, my executive.\n\n01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.840\nYeah.\n\n01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:22.400\nBut my new assistant, I'm not going to ask her to throw away\n\n01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.440\na box the size of a child's coffin.\n\n01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.400\nShe couldn't lift it.\n\n01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.480\nWith Chinese lettering and Dan Harmon written on it\n\n01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:31.560\nand magic marker.\n\n01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.560\nShe wouldn't be able to lift it.\n\n01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.440\nWell, yeah, she'd have to hire some people that I was like,\n\n01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.280\nshe'd have to hire Steve.\n\n01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:37.840\nThis is crazy.\n\n01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.720\nLike, how do you get rid of one of these fucking things?\n\n01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:40.640\nI've never thought.\n\n01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.200\nI called a morgue.\n\n01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.320\nWas this the original doll that you bought a long time ago?\n\n01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:48.040\nHe'll figure it out eventually.\n\n01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.600\nWas this doll number one?\n\n01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.160\nOr did you die from having a metal skeleton inside of her?\n\n01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:56.960\nIt was a second doll.\n\n01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:58.040\nThere was a second doll.\n\n01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.080\nOn the grassy knoll.\n\n01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:09.000\nSo I texted Levy.\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.360\nWell, we made a deal.\n\n01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.240\nRight, because you were like, oh, they\n\n01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.320\nneed you to come back for a record\n\n01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.840\nbefore the screening of this.\n\n01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:18.360\nAnd I'm like, I'm over here up to my knees.\n\n01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.160\nFor those of you who don't know, we've\n\n01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.480\nbeen talking a lot about all of our celebrities that\n\n01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:24.000\nare voicing characters on Rick and Morty.\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.480\nBut really, you're the new Ryan Ridley\n\n01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.440\nin terms of voice.\n\n01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:32.520\nYou're a lot of really funny characters.\n\n01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:36.360\nYou guys will see Dan Harmon, great voice actors.\n\n01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.240\nSome of the funny characters that you'll\n\n01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.800\nbe seeing on Rick and Morty, but mostly hearing are.\n\n01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.800\nHave you heard Mr. Egg?\n\n01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.360\nDan, I heard that you do Captain Yeast.\n\n01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.480\nYou do Harvey Fierstein.\n\n01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:52.160\nThey're all student-related.\n\n01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.960\nCan we hear your Harvey Fierstein\n\n01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:55.440\nthat you're doing on season?\n\n01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.520\nHarvey Fierstein theme.\n\n01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.440\nSorry, sorry.\n\n01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:00.240\nOK, Captain, yeah, we made this.\n\n01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:02.840\nWe need you to come in to record some of your characters.\n\n01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.960\nRight, so you needed me, and I was\n\n01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.080\nin the middle of moving stuff, and I'm like, all right,\n\n01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.160\nlook, I'll make you a deal.\n\n01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:13.360\nBecause I had just finished wrapping this greasy box up\n\n01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.920\nand was like, how am I going to fucking,\n\n01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.120\nwhat do you do with this thing?\n\n01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.800\nEveryone has one friend with a pickup,\n\n01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.160\nand maybe knows where a dump is.\n\n01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.320\nI've led a privileged life, and I just\n\n01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:28.400\nhave this body in a box.\n\n01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.400\nIt really, it's like 200 pounds.\n\n01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:36.240\nYeah, because the skeleton is titanium on these things.\n\n01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.160\nThey got a recycled machine.\n\n01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:42.280\nSo I just kind of wrapped it up in two layers of plastic bag,\n\n01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.840\nthe box, and wrapped duct tape all around it,\n\n01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.080\nand then I texted Livia a photo of it\n\n01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.320\nand stayed on my bedroom floor.\n\n01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.320\nI was like, if you come over here,\n\n01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:53.040\nand this thing is gone when I get back,\n\n01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.720\nthen I'll go to work right now.\n\n01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.440\nAnd he's like, deal, I'm on my way.\n\n01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:01.800\nAnd I was like, it's like an old political thriller.\n\n01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.600\nYou literally know where the bodies are buried.\n\n01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:06.080\nIt was quid pro quo.\n\n01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:06.720\nYeah.\n\n01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:08.760\nWhere did you take it, Livia?\n\n01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.080\nSo I.\n\n01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.360\nAnd who'd you call?\n\n01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.840\nYeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get there.\n\n01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.160\nYay.\n\n01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:20.160\nSo I went up to Dan's bedroom, assessed this giant box.\n\n01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.040\nI brought tape and a Sharpie of my own, just in case you didn't.\n\n01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.040\nYou weren't able to cover up.\n\n01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.800\nCross out the name Dan Harmon.\n\n01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:27.920\nYeah, yeah, box.\n\n01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.840\nI don't know what you have at your house or whatever.\n\n01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:34.080\nSo it is a really heavy box.\n\n01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:36.920\nI know it.\n\n01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.360\nIt was probably telling me.\n\n01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:43.480\nIt was probably between 80 and 115 pounds.\n\n01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:44.600\nNo, it's over 100.\n\n01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:45.640\nIt's got to be.\n\n01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.600\nWell, I lifted the whole thing.\n\n01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:50.800\nIt really glimpsed into the life of a serial killer,\n\n01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.960\nbecause we've joked about it in my youth with my fetishes\n\n01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.200\nand things and me getting mannequin legs and things\n\n01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:56.700\nlike that.\n\n01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:59.400\nBut these are just hollow plastic things.\n\n01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:06.280\nBut this body, and the idea of getting rid of it,\n\n01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:09.720\nand the whole thing being this needs to go away,\n\n01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.800\nas opposed to this thing is a thing\n\n01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.320\nthat you can have and just store it somewhere.\n\n01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.240\nBut it's the idea of this needs to go away,\n\n01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:19.520\nand no one needs to ever find it.\n\n01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.080\nIt was this introduction in my head.\n\n01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.880\nI was sort of like, God, can you imagine\n\n01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:28.000\nif it was also rotting and was an actual crime instead\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.880\nof just a thing that could ruin your life\n\n01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.120\nand make everyone laugh at you?\n\n01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:35.080\nBut it was sort of like minus the fact\n\n01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:38.480\nthat it's actually heavier than an equal-sized body would be.\n\n01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.640\nIt was just such a weird glimpse into that world.\n\n01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:46.920\nIsn't there like a real doll website, like an FAQ portion?\n\n01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:49.560\nOr was like, how do I dispose of this when I'm through?\n\n01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.560\nI don't think they want to shine a light on the fact\n\n01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.200\nthat these things are actually, you know,\n\n01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:56.160\nthat they must eventually go away.\n\n01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.400\nI think pet stores are the same way.\n\n01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.920\nDid you have any, like?\n\n01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.680\nThey don't say, hey, look at this.\n\n01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.960\nMaltese ticket is to a fucking heartbreaking tragedy\n\n01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:06.280\nseven years from now.\n\n01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.280\nSeven?\n\n01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.960\nDid you have any, like, on average?\n\n01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.440\nI'm guessing the answer is no.\n\n01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.080\nDid you have any, like, how much time\n\n01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.320\ndid you spend with this doll?\n\n01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:18.760\nAnd did you feel kind of any weird attachment to it?\n\n01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:21.120\nLike, not like in a human way, but like, like.\n\n01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:21.960\nNo.\n\n01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:24.400\nBye, Laura.\n\n01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.240\nBye.\n\n01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.480\nShe wanted you to say yes.\n\n01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:28.320\nSteve.\n\n01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.160\nYeah.\n\n01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.120\nDid you look inside?\n\n01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.160\nNo.\n\n01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.480\nGod, no.\n\n01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.520\nThat's not part of the job.\n\n01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:34.840\nSteve, did you fuck it?\n\n01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.920\nI was curious, like, what the head looked like.\n\n01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.040\nOh, I'm not.\n\n01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.520\nI'm not, like, just like, I don't know what these things\n\n01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:43.360\nactually look like.\n\n01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.480\nI've never looked at a picture, but.\n\n01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:45.320\nThey're online.\n\n01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:46.160\nYou could see that online.\n\n01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:47.840\nI guess I could have.\n\n01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.680\nBut whatever.\n\n01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:49.520\nYou showed up.\n\n01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.000\nI thought that maybe there was some, like, sentimental value\n\n01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.960\nbecause a dummy, because, you know,\n\n01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.600\nit's like it inspired a show.\n\n01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:58.040\nWell, yeah, I sent a photo of the box all taped up to Cody,\n\n01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.280\nwho I don't think ever saw it.\n\n01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.880\nShe was always asking me, can I please see it?\n\n01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:04.040\nI'm like, no, because I'm ashamed of it.\n\n01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.800\nYou know, like, I don't, it's like,\n\n01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.680\none thing to be honest about having it,\n\n01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.560\nit's another thing.\n\n01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.240\nI don't want you looking at it.\n\n01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.640\nLike, it's like, me sitting up here saying,\n\n01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.200\nlike, I have a small dick, and I was like,\n\n01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.200\nI don't know, like, show you it.\n\n01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.040\nLike, because.\n\n01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.360\nCody's never seen your dick.\n\n01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.200\nOf course not.\n\n01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.040\nLevy had to put it in a box and dispose of it.\n\n01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:38.280\nI will say one thing that, like, for people,\n\n01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:41.520\nI don't know, just like, because these graphic details.\n\n01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:46.040\nNow that I imagine I am a previous sex doll owner\n\n01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.160\nthat will never probably own another one,\n\n01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:54.600\nthe one weird detail about it is.\n\n01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.680\nProbably.\n\n01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:59.600\nThe arm, the shoulder joints,\n\n01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:03.200\nlike, you imagine like, you're dealing with this thing\n\n01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.160\nthat has like this skeleton, and it's like,\n\n01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:08.560\nit has ball and socket joints where the shoulders are.\n\n01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.200\nIt has, I think, ball and socket joints\n\n01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.440\nwhere the hips are.\n\n01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.440\nBecause you want to be able to GI Joe the thighs,\n\n01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.520\nwherever you want, but then the knees and the elbows\n\n01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:24.840\nare simple 90 degree, like, whatever you call it.\n\n01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:28.880\nLike, they rotate on one axis, not 360.\n\n01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.880\nBut the shoulders and the hips are ball and socket.\n\n01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:35.320\nSo, while for the legs, that's not really a problem\n\n01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.280\nbecause you're not gonna like, move the legs in a way\n\n01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.520\nthat you're gonna then forget.\n\n01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:43.880\nLike, it's like, the legs are just a bigger deal.\n\n01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:46.960\nThe arms, however, should you be deciding to,\n\n01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:51.480\nI don't know, put a special outfit on this thing.\n\n01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:53.200\nA cute top you picked out.\n\n01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.680\nLike, you're gonna be like,\n\n01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:01.680\nyou're gonna be moving the arms, like, up.\n\n01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:08.840\nAnd then, you might move the arms down,\n\n01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.200\nand then you might move the arms this way,\n\n01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.080\nand then you might move the arms this way,\n\n01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:17.120\nand then in the, there's like, what we would call\n\n01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:20.080\nin the 3D animation business, kind of like a gimbal lock,\n\n01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.440\nkind of an effect that could happen\n\n01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.880\nwhere the root rotation is kind of lost,\n\n01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:28.440\nand you can notice over time,\n\n01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.080\nlike, this thing was in the box,\n\n01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.080\nand the biceps had just become, like, twizzlers.\n\n01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:38.000\nLike, they were just twisted\n\n01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.760\nbecause the arms at some point had been rotated 360 degrees.\n\n01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:44.000\nBut Dan, some people find that pretty sexy.\n\n01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.480\nYeah.\n\n01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.960\nWell, also the fact that the silicone skin,\n\n01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:52.600\nwhich, you know, health experts will tell you\n\n01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.160\nit's constantly off-gassing.\n\n01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:57.200\nLike, so it's probably like, what the fuck is that?\n\n01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.040\nIt's a spider.\n\n01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.560\nLong web.\n\n01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.280\nMan, if they ever make flying spiders,\n\n01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.440\nI'm gonna kill myself.\n\n01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.960\nWell, they say spiders actually do fly.\n\n01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:09.800\nYeah.\n\n01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:10.640\nBecause of the,\n\n01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.560\nDidn't you see,\n\n01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.240\nThat's how they were able to spin their web so large.\n\n01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:14.080\nFive from home.\n\n01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:14.920\nWhat, they said, what?\n\n01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.280\nOkay, so Dan, listen up.\n\n01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:18.240\nYou just, like, no one can look this up.\n\n01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.600\nLike, spiders, spiders shoot out a silk\n\n01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:21.720\nthat goes in the air,\n\n01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.120\nand then it catches, like, electron particles,\n\n01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.200\nor something in the air,\n\n01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.600\nand then it magnetically propels them,\n\n01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.720\nlike, they're surfing or flying a kite.\n\n01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:31.680\nAll right, well, then I'm already dead.\n\n01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:32.560\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.600\nSo is Jeff.\n\n01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.240\nSo is the audience.\n\n01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:38.000\nYeah, I think that thing's like a bat.\n\n01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.640\nAll right, so,\n\n01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:41.480\nSex doll.\n\n01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:42.800\nWait, what was the, oh, there's one other thing.\n\n01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.120\nI was holding this.\n\n01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.600\nSo, there's one other thing for,\n\n01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.600\nYou're fucking a twizzler.\n\n01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:47.840\nAnd you mean fucking it.\n\n01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.440\nFor future sex doll owners,\n\n01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:52.000\nI do wanna tell you one more thing.\n\n01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.480\nLike, watch those fingers,\n\n01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:55.040\nbecause the fingers are wires.\n\n01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.160\nThey're just, like, gumby.\n\n01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.520\nLike, so, if you care, I mean, I didn't.\n\n01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.960\nI'm, like, I'm not, like, a finger guy.\n\n01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.640\nSo, but, like,\n\n01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:04.480\nI'm a big finger guy.\n\n01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.440\nThey're just gonna eventually just always be,\n\n01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.640\nlike, in this permanent state of, like,\n\n01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.920\na witch about to cast a spell.\n\n01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.360\nSchrab's doing a funny.\n\n01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:16.360\nLet's Steve take a picture.\n\n01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:19.600\nThat's a pretty good,\n\n01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.120\nUh,\n\n01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:23.960\nHubba, hubba.\n\n01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.800\nAnd then,\n\n01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:31.280\nAnd don't lay it down on anything with ink in it.\n\n01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.160\nLike, if you were to lay,\n\n01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.280\nBecause, because the silicone is, like,\n\n01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.120\nIt's sort of like,\n\n01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.600\nLike, silicone putty.\n\n01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.440\nSo, it's like,\n\n01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.120\nThe silicone is sort of like a,\n\n01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.280\nYou know, it's like,\n\n01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:46.640\nThey can't, like, store old Star Trek, like, prosthetics,\n\n01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.840\nBecause that silicone is, like, constantly enough.\n\n01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.520\nIt's, like, it's, like,\n\n01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:52.720\nIt's, like, slowly turning to goo.\n\n01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.120\nJust very slowly.\n\n01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.360\nWhich is what you want.\n\n01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.360\nAnd in the short term, though,\n\n01:39:58.360 --> 01:39:59.360\nYou could, if you were, like,\n\n01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.640\nTo take a silicone, like,\n\n01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.080\nLike, form and, like, lay it on something\n\n01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:06.000\nThat had, like, a cardboard box\n\n01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.120\nThat had, like, writing on it,\n\n01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:12.320\nThen that writing could be on its tattoo,\n\n01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.040\nOn its arm forever.\n\n01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:14.880\nSo.\n\n01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.080\nWhat was on hers?\n\n01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.400\nThis side up.\n\n01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.240\nYeah, well.\n\n01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:20.920\nWell, what does it say?\n\n01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.920\nWhat did it say, Pettix?\n\n01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.240\nWell.\n\n01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.880\nIt was, I mean, I wanted to be something fun,\n\n01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.600\nBut it was just, no, it was just green.\n\n01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:34.280\nIt was just fucking, whatever it was laid

privacy, but she's like,\n\n01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:51.320\nI don't need products anymore.\n\n01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:56.320\nBut if I, if, if, if in an alternate universe,\n\n01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:00.360\nknowing what I now know as a consumer, just to,\n\n01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:03.400\nto shed light on my experience with these products,\n\n01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:05.760\nI would, I would just get on Amazon.\n\n01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.240\nNow you can just get, there's like, you can pick the,\n\n01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.920\nyou can get just a foot.\n\n01:43:12.920 -->
