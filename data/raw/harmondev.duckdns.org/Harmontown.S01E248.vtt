{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:13.000\nFrom beautiful Uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:19.000\nSpencer Crittenden.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:30.000\nWhat's in that bag? Special stuff in that bag. I don't know, man.\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:38.000\nLet's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:40.000\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:43.000\nWow, I think it's a new lighting setup, right?\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:46.000\nI'm assuming the microphone's further back because it's part of a new lighting setup?\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:47.000\nI don't know.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:50.000\nWhy do I always start the show in the worst fucking way?\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:58.000\nNot just the worst way, but just specifically in, like, really wondering about whether the microphone's position is important in some way.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:05.000\nLike, whether it's intentional or haphazard is, like, that's been a topic of discussion at the top of the show many times.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:09.000\nYeah, I guess it's the first thing that I, uh, see.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:11.000\nYeah, no, I'm sure that's why.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:18.000\nIt's not a scripted show. I don't have a plan to talk about anything. I mean, I have a couple notes.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:27.000\nI passed a very important romantic threshold on my trip to New Orleans to celebrate Cody's mom's 70th birthday.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:35.000\nWe went to this city. New Orleans is great.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:42.000\nSo you like music and food? Who doesn't? I don't understand that part of it. I'm not yelling at them.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:47.000\nThey've been through enough, but I just don't understand. Who doesn't like music and food?\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:51.000\nAnd what if I go to your city that's famous for its food?\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:57.000\nSo you got your Portland, you know, let's say your Asheville, North Carolina, we've been to, Austin, New Orleans.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.000\nThe big food cities.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:01.000\nThe food cities where it's like, oh, well, all the food's good.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:03.000\nAnd it is. We always go there.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:10.000\nIf you go to these cities and open a bad restaurant, is it just that it's the momentum of the capitalistic biosphere there?\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:16.000\nLike, just people wouldn't go. They go, this food's terrible. I'm a Portlandier. I know the difference.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:23.000\nI'm not going to. And then you would. So like, these are just cities that have created an ecosystem of foodie-ism?\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:27.000\nSo you're mad at New Orleans for liking food and for liking music?\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:32.000\nI'm just wondering if it's all a scam. You know, you just say your city is the home of good food.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:34.000\nAnd then people would just go, mmm, this is delicious.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:40.000\nLike, I'm kind of suspicious of it because I ate a lot of things called, like, Creole omelettes and they really tasted like omelettes.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:47.000\nYou're not supposed to get a Creole omelette. You're supposed to get a bag of crawdads or some, like, you know, a beignet and shit.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:53.000\nAnd what is this obsession with the Saints marching in? Like, that's a really horrible song.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:58.000\nIt's about the apocalypse. It's like, it's an apocalyptic, biblical song.\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.000\nRight.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:00.000\nIt's zealotry.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:01.000\nIt's about picking the right team.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nAnyways, that's not what I wanted to talk about.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:16.000\nI was in a hotel room and we were going to go out to breakfast and I didn't at any time, and I certainly noticed, I never, as we were leaving the hotel room,\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:21.000\nI never asked, I never made sure that both Cody and I had a key.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:33.000\nAnd I always did that. I was married and I always, I've never stayed in a hotel room with somebody and didn't make sure that we both had keys when we left the room.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:34.000\nRight.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:40.000\nSo, symbolically, this means that something has, I've let go of something in the back of my head as I leave a hotel room with Cody.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:43.000\nLike, I imagine we'll be coming back together.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:51.000\nAww. Or that's assuming we're coming back together, no matter what.\n\n03:51.000 --> 04:02.000\nWell, I mean, you could look at it as clingy, but I think it's more unhealthy than I was always, like, prepared for the event of coming home separately.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nRight.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:11.000\nLike, well into my marriage, I was still like, well, you know, stitch in time.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:16.000\nIt's a weird thing to be prepared for, you know, like, oh, well, you never know.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:19.000\nNow you feel healthy because you, likeâ€¦\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:24.000\nYeah, it never even occurred to me. Like, there's like the third time we went out, I was like, oh, shit, I haven't had a hotel key this whole time.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:30.000\nI'm like, totally comfortable being completely dependent on this woman.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:34.000\nSee, it sounds pretty co-dependent.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:40.000\nYeah. I mean, I think it's a good, I think it's a good move in the right direction for me.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nYesterday was a good day. You all know what this is.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nDid you have to use your AK?\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:49.000\nYes. No, no, I didn't. It was a good day.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nThat was a good day.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:57.000\nBut, you know, well, I picked up my gun.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nYay.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:02.000\nDid you use your AK or did you not use your AK?\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:07.000\nI learned to field strip my Glock 19 in my bed and oil it.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:10.000\nSo you finally got your gun? Yeah.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nDanny got his gun? Yeah.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:18.000\nAnd it's amazing, like, guns are amazing.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:22.000\nIt's one of the greatest ways to shoot bullets.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:35.000\nThat's the thing, so that's the thing that was great, because part of the safety manual or the owner's manual, period, is that first of all, let me explain how a gun works and what's happening when you pull the trigger so that you don't blow yourself up or someone else that you're not meaning to,\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nbecause it's a lethal weapon that you bought to put holes in people.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:41.000\nBut let's make sure you don't put in the wrong person.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nAnd so they explained how everything works.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:48.000\nAnd it kind of really sinks home, because the ammunition, you buy by the bucket.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:52.000\nLike, I said, oh, I guess I need some bullets for this.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nAnd the lady said, how many buckets of ammunition do you have?\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nYeah. And I was like, buckets.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:03.000\nAnd she's like, yeah, behind you, there's the target range bullets, and then there's the home defense bullets.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nThose are more expensive. Why?\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:09.000\nBecause the target range bullets will just go through walls and stuff.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:14.000\nSo even though they're kind of more dangerous, they're cheaper.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:19.000\nThe more expensive bullets are the ones that are just for shooting someone in your bedroom.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:22.000\nBut the ones that just explode inside of human bodies.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:23.000\nThat's what I was thinking.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:26.000\nI was like, do they lob out and land on the burglar?\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:31.000\nBut no, it probably is that they're just made of different stuff and they're not going through.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:35.000\nThe gun range bullets are more deadly than the non?\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nAnd cheaper.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.000\nI bought a paint bucket full of bullets.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:44.000\nAnd that's just an interesting sideline in this world of mass shootings and stuff.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:50.000\nWhen they go and they look in the trunk of the person and they say, look how much ammunition they had.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nBut you buy this stuff in bulk.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:58.000\nAnd the odd thing to me is that these guns, they're basically staplers that have a little,\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:03.000\nyou put a little rocket in them and it's got a bunch of explosives in it.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nLike a stapler.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nWell the gun part is like a stapler.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:13.000\nUp until the point where instead of a stapler there's a fucking tiny rocket.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:14.000\nSo that's my point.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nChris Rock has that joke about we don't need gun control, we need bullet control.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:21.000\nThat would be the solution to make bullets really expensive.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nBut I'm not making that same joke.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:28.000\nBut I am saying like, isn't it fucking weird that we don't regulate bullet?\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nLike you could walk into that store.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:31.000\nI don't need a license.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:32.000\nJust buy these things.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nLike ostensibly I can go home and make a gun.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nPeople make guns in prisons out of like bunk bed legs.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nLike I saw Hill Street Blues once there was a guy.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nHe was like, I got a, he was like a zip gun or something.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:46.000\nHe's holding like a little toothbrush thing he made.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:53.000\nAs long as it hits the firing pin receiver thing on the back, the primer cap.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nAnd you can talk the talk.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nI was just like, that's the thing that kills you.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nThere's a bucket of little rockets in my bedroom.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:05.000\nAnd it was like eight bucks for a thousand of them or something.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nAnd it's like, those things kill babies.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nThis gun is just like, you take it apart.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nLike John Wick, you learn how to do that to clean it.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nAnd it's like, and that's when you realize all those movies, you know,\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.000\nlike you see the movies where the guy like grabs the gun and field strips it with one hand,\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nlike the slider fly, you can't, come on.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:30.000\nIf I did that, if I was a thug and I was like patrolling a drug layer\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:35.000\nand a guy in a trench coat that was like the hero came around the corner\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:39.000\nand he grabbed the gun, I'd be like, oh fuck, God, you're good.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:44.000\nAnd then, but then if he like stripped it, like took it apart really fast,\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nI'd be like, okay, who, what are you, a magician?\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:51.000\nLike, what are you spending your time on learning how to do that?\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:55.000\nThen you, maybe I should try to grab the gun back because I, like, that's all.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:59.000\nThat's like if you grabbed your gun and then like did a card trick or something.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:04.000\nLike, the best time to take a gun away from somebody is when it's taken apart.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nIt's the safest time.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nWell, you could be easier.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nYeah, anyways, I'm just saying, it's hard to.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nAlso, I like that you think that bullets are rockets.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nThey are, they have a little combustible thing.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nThey have a little cartridge that there's good gunpowder.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nI mean, it's like, that's the part that kills you.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nWhat size gun do you have?\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nWhat's the ammunition you have?\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nIt's a 9mm, right?\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nAnd I'm sorry, I know I stimulated the market.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nI'm part of the problem.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:34.000\nWe've had gun violence just this last week and here I am like stimulating that market.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.000\nIt's like, for instance, if I was going to have someone up to talk about this amazing movie\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:44.000\nthat has a very pro-vegetarian kind of vibe and I've been eating fucking sausage like crazy after.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nLike, yeah, we're part of the problem when we vote with our dollars.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:50.000\nI bought a gun, but that, I have no excuse.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nI'm just scared.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:55.000\nI'm like, I'm doomsday crepping.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\nWe got ham radio instruction manuals.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:02.000\nMan, yeah, I'm learning how to read, do ham radios.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nThis shit's hard, man.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nThere's a ham radio store.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nIt was so much easier for you to just get the gun.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nYeah.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nIt was so easy to get the gun.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:15.000\nAnd then we went to the ham radio store and the guy's like, all right, what's going on here?\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:19.000\nTell me what you want and I'll tell you how you can get out a month from now.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nAnd it was like crazy.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nLike we bought for $30.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:29.000\nYeah, his position was like trying to, it was like a secret club where he was trying to not tip his hand\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:33.000\nbut gauge where we were on the totem pole of ham radio.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nRight.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:38.000\nBecause there is a totem pole of ham radio and there is like three or four tears.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nBut you can be mentally ill and buy a gun.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:42.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nYeah, and they're lifting those regulations like crazy.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nThose people have lost their minds.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\nYou don't even need to pass background checks half the time\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:55.000\nbecause like background checks can get expedited and if they go, I mean, this is certain states,\n\n10:55.000 --> 11:00.000\nbut if a certain time period lapse, they'll just go, oh, it's been too long.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nLet's not do a background check anymore.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:05.000\nAnd then so people just get guns without background checks.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nIt's great.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:15.000\nSo yesterday was a good day because I was like, I'm just on this crazy roller coaster where I swear it's,\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:20.000\nI have to be totally honest and just say if President Trump is upset, I'm happy.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:23.000\nAnd if he's happy, I'm just depressed.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nI can't do anything.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:30.000\nSo if he's tweeting like, hey, I don't know.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:35.000\nIf he's just like spiking his little toddler football, like I'll just have a bad day all day.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:40.000\nBut then two days ago, it was like this great morning because he had that tweet\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:44.000\nabout how he was under investigation and he's like throwing his fire truck around the room.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:50.000\nAnd it just felt good and all of the articles were about like it's closing in on him\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:51.000\nand he's under investigation.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:52.000\nI can't believe you admitted it.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:57.000\nWhat a dummy and all this stuff and just all the, you know, I refreshed on all the threads\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nof how we're going to prove that he colluded with the Russians.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nThis isn't conspiracy theory.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nThis is a real thing.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.000\nAnd now we're going to get his financials and blah, blah, blah and all this stuff.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nIt just felt really good.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.000\nAnd then this morning it was like, his lawyer says he's not under investigation.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nI was just like, what the fuck?\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nThat's why I got the gun.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:18.000\nI got the gun because the only thing I understand is that I'm out of control.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:25.000\nAnd I don't know if you know how hard it is to be white and male and fragile.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:29.000\nAnd you've said before that if you had to kill yourself, you'd do it with a gun, right?\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nYeah, I did say.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nYeah.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nI don't know.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:41.000\nPeople don't realize how much the real heroes of Handmaid's Tale are the commanders.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:48.000\nI have a question about Handmaid's Tale.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:54.000\nIs it part of the point of that dystopia that even the men are miserable?\n\n12:54.000 --> 13:04.000\nBecause isn't it a dystopic thing where the patriarchy is out of control and the women are just objects of fertility and servants and things.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nAnd they don't have rights anymore.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:16.000\nBut there's no men lighting cigars with women's hair and going like, I love having balls.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:22.000\nThey're all bummed out because they have to fuck their babysitter when they're looking at their wife.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nAnd everyone's sad.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:28.000\nAnd I'm like, what kind of patriarchy is this?\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:33.000\nShouldn't it look at least like a little bit like 60s playboy club?\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:42.000\nLike they're luring little tales and the conception sessions are like private and involve music.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:48.000\nI wish we could just find a dystopia where we could have fun.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:55.000\nBut that makes me wonder, is that part of the commentary that it's not just about if men had their way, it would be awful.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nIt's more about look what we do to ourselves.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:04.000\nThe patriarchy is the patriarchy because it's not self-aware enough to understand what it wants and doesn't want.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:08.000\nWe'll all land ourselves if we continue to follow this path.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:17.000\nIf we use the excuses of religion and gender identity to construct a society where everyone gets to do what they want, nobody's going to get to do what they want.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nEveryone's going to be all bummed out and under pressure.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:25.000\nAnd it would be better if we just relaxed, even if we were a little infertile.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nI agree.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:43.000\nMy other question is, in the book, after she plays Scrabble with him, does it have like the 80s needle drop?\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:51.000\nWell, she walks in slow-mo like in Mean Girls. I felt like it was mixed messaging, but I'm not a guy, but I'm enjoying the show.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:58.000\nI am a guy, and I am a guy, and I'm enjoying the show.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:03.000\nDan, it's okay to not be a guy.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:09.000\nBut we are kind of behind. We haven't watched Handmaid's Tale for a while, so maybe we didn't enjoy it.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:13.000\nMaybe we got turned off by the Mean Girls' slow-mo walks. Maybe we bailed on it.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:18.000\nMaybe we were like, what is this? What's going on? Let's watch Wizard of Lies. Why is it called Wizard of Lies?\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:22.000\nIs this supposed to sound like Wizard of Lies? What are they going for?\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:30.000\nWhy is this a nonlinear story if the whole thing takes place in an apartment?\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:33.000\nHow's your book coming along?\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:38.000\nI'm working very hard on it. It's almost done. It's almost done.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:45.000\nJust shut up. They're going to sue the fuck out of me.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:50.000\nI'm working hard on it. I had to go back and rewrite part of the introduction where I was like,\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:54.000\nI'm introducing a book. Okay, hold on. The election's on. What the fuck?\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:59.000\nThere's no such thing as a book that you've started before the fucking election.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nA lot of creatives are going through this.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:06.000\nThere's also positive effects of the election where I'm finding as I work with writers\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:09.000\ndifferent stuff where we're breaking stories about a snowman that comes alive\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:15.000\nor a robot that fucks a shoe. Whatever it is, even though it has nothing to do with politics,\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:22.000\nthere's been a 10% decrease in the need for suspension of disbelief. Does that make sense?\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:26.000\nIt's just across the board. All writers, I'm not kidding. It sounds like a joke,\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:29.000\nbut it's like an every single project that I started before the election\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:33.000\nand now I'm working on after the election where I'm having trouble with stories and stuff.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:37.000\nWe just go like, wait, so can't he just be a time traveler? And then they go,\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:44.000\nyeah, why did we rule that out? Oh, because, yeah, that was before the singularity started glitching out.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:51.000\nAnd like, wait, why don't we just have her say, snowman, snowman, come alive, man.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:58.000\nAnd she could just walk up the walls like Lionel Richie and...\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:03.000\nShe'd put the ceiling fan in her head and fly out the skylight like Inspector Gadget.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:10.000\nWhy didn't we think of that before? I don't know. What was blocking us before?\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:15.000\nAnything can happen. I got a gun. Yeah, I'm going to fucking kill myself with it.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:16.000\nDon't do that.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.000\nEventually.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nDon't.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nYou want me to die of a stomach ulcer?\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:21.000\nYeah.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:27.000\nOh, man, I hope you die of a stomach ulcer.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:32.000\nCan they kill you? A stomach ulcer? Can you die of an ulcer?\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nI know. Well, you get stomach...\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:38.000\nAn unintended stomach ulcer could create stomach cancer, I guess.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nDo you have ulcers?\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:43.000\nI assume I have ul... No, I don't feel anything in my tum-tum.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:48.000\nI have horrible heartburn. Chronic, horrible heartburn.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:53.000\nIt's got to be just 40 years of just soaking my esophageal flap in vodka.\n\n17:53.000 --> 18:01.000\nI can tell because if I eat popcorn, I now have to consciously breathe then eat the popcorn\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nand not breathe while I'm eating the popcorn.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:09.000\nIf I'm watching a movie where a Voorhees or something comes around the corner and I go,\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:16.000\nthe popcorn's going straight into every alveoli balloon.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:20.000\nI just have lungs full of popcorn that are just disintegrating.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:25.000\nThere's like dormant tuberculosis in there like eating the popcorn.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:31.000\nI didn't know what did I do right.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:34.000\nSo you got to be careful.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:37.000\nYou seem a little down. You said yesterday was a good day or today was a good day.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nYeah, today's a bad day because it's just like, I'm not under investigation.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nYou can't control this guy.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:46.000\nHe's just a big... There's a baby.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:58.000\nThere's a baby on a motorcycle like driving in a bullet store with these swinging firing pins around in a bag.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nJust throwing them everywhere.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:05.000\nI mean, a baby in a motorcycle in a bullet store is not going to set the bullets off.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:09.000\nI know. And maybe that's why the bullets aren't dangerous because nothing can.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:13.000\nIt just seems to me like if you look at the mechanism of a gun, the firing pin goes...\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:19.000\nIt's just like a thing. It just seems like you could fire a bullet by hitting it real hard with a hairpin.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:25.000\nYeah, yeah. Like if you had pliers and a small hammer, you could go bang.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:29.000\nShoot so much.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nYou never hear about those shootings.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nHave you shot your gun yet? Have you taken it to the range?\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:39.000\nNo, no. I want to learn to use it.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:47.000\nThere's a firing range nearby here and they have a weekend gun safety class, but I don't know, man.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:56.000\nThe last place I want to be is like a group of weekend intro gun safety class humans.\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:02.000\nAlso, people keep going into gun ranges and killing themselves because you get a gun and it's free.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.000\nWhen it's free, it's cheap. People just keep blowing their heads off.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:11.000\nGun ranges. That's just part of the territory. That's just a price of admission.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:17.000\nSometimes you get like a chicken and your egg McMuffin.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:21.000\nThat probably doesn't happen.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:26.000\nAlright, anyways.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:34.000\nWe're bringing up our friend now, our new friend that I met at Netflix screening for this movie that's coming out, Okja.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:40.000\nGod damn it, it's Bong John Ho, June Ho.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:44.000\nBong June Ho? Did I get that name right?\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nBong is the first name.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:52.000\nThere's like a thing where the people that refer to working with him on set is like a part of Korean culture.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nYou call him Director Bong.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:57.000\nThat is like kind of fun. I don't know.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nThat is fun.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:05.000\nI wish we had that. If you're a director or you should be called writer Harmon or writer Dan.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:09.000\nYeah, I don't know. I'd like it.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:15.000\nAnd then all the fertile women, we can round them up dressed like nuns.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:19.000\nPut in a sizzling red color.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:23.000\nSizzling.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.000\nRed nuns is hot.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:30.000\nThey're the handmaids. They're like red nuns.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:33.000\nBut only when they go to buy oranges? Like they also have to buy oranges for everybody?\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nOkay, alright.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:38.000\nI'll work up my dystopia. It's got third act problems.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:43.000\nBut anyways, this is a friend of Cody's who was there.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:44.000\nThat's why we were at the screening.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nBecause I was at the screening, I didn't know anything about the movie.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nI never saw a trailer.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:56.000\nSo my mind was blown by this movie, so I was like, come talk about it even though you guys haven't had a chance to see it yet.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nIt's coming to Netflix next week.\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:00.000\nBut let's welcome our new friend, Christina Oh.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:18.000\nOh, thank you. Christina brought a foam oakja.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nShe fell.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nA foam what? What is it?\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nIt's a super pig.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:35.000\nOh, it's a super pig. Oakja in the movie is a super pig created by a corporation to genetically modified in order to solve world hunger.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:39.000\nThese aren't spoilers, right? It's the first five minutes of the movie they explained it all.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:54.000\nAnd so there's giant pigs that are being tested and the story follows the ownership of one giant pig, Oakja, and her owner.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nWhat's her name?\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:56.000\nMija.\n\n22:56.000 --> 23:02.000\nAnyways, I saw you after the movie and I was like, I think that was a perfect movie.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nI think it was a 10% Gillin Hall reduction.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:07.000\nPeople are going to say he's over the top.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nBut I didn't care.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:14.000\nBut I don't know why I qualified it with that, but it's because truly I wanted to.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nI really thought it was a perfect movie.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:23.000\nAnd then you were shocked to hear that and it seemed like so was Bong. Can I call him Bong?\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nYou have to call him Director Bong.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nDirector Bong?\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:30.000\nRight. So the last name comes first is the formality, right?\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nYeah, it's a very honorific culture.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:37.000\nYou got to eat that mic.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nOh, because my mic's hot.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:42.000\nNo, it's just picking you up for a really far away.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:45.000\nYeah, your mic's not as hot because we're in an honorific culture too.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nSo the male gets the better mic.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nThere's a glass ceiling on your mic decibels.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nOkay, I will put it in.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:54.000\nI got to check through mine too.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:55.000\nSee, I'm like right here.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nBut don't cover it with your hand. Yeah, there you go.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nOkay.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:01.000\nUnless you're going to beat box, then I find that helps because it helps the peas not pop.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nThat looks cool too.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:11.000\nOh, John.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nSo this movie was co-written by Director Bong and...\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:14.000\nJohn Ronson?\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:15.000\nNo, tell us about him.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.000\nJohn?\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nYeah. Was he there at the screening?\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:21.000\nHe was not. He was not.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:22.000\nHe's cool though.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:27.000\nHe's an author, well, he's a well reviewed author and he has worked...\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:30.000\nHe's known Bong forever, Director Bong forever.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.680\nAnd then he came up with this site or director Bond came up with a site crazy idea\n\n24:33.680 --> 24:37.640\nI think driving down a countryside and he saw this billboard\n\n24:38.400 --> 24:43.680\nOr he saw this animal and was just like, oh, you know, what's it doing out in the middle of nowhere and\n\n24:44.360 --> 24:48.640\nWhat was that animal? He mentioned that but he didn't mention the species of animal. I don't know\n\n24:49.920 --> 24:52.840\nCute animal thing in Korea. Yeah\n\n24:53.920 --> 24:56.280\nThe the so the movie\n\n24:56.280 --> 25:03.120\nUh, it's not gonna be theatrically released. Well, we're gonna so Netflix will do a day-in-date\n\n25:04.360 --> 25:08.480\nJune 28th, and it will play in I pick theaters in LA for like a week or so\n\n25:08.480 --> 25:12.280\nbut no, we want you to go watch it on Netflix and\n\n25:14.400 --> 25:20.920\nHe talked about that a little bit and he was answering questions through a translator, but he speaks fine enough English\n\n25:20.920 --> 25:25.720\nTo do conversative stuff, but he what I what I was gleaning was that\n\n25:26.120 --> 25:31.200\nHe every every director probably wants their movie to be on every theater screen in the world on Friday night\n\n25:31.200 --> 25:37.160\nAnd everyone go out and eat popcorn and watch it like we're gonna so it'll be a while before people get used to that not being the case\n\n25:37.160 --> 25:38.280\nbut\n\n25:38.280 --> 25:43.920\nIt was worth it any the lack of that to work with Netflix. This is an unpaid plug\n\n25:44.800 --> 25:46.800\nbecause they're really like\n\n25:46.800 --> 25:50.680\nThey're there they they I don't want to make them sound irresponsible\n\n25:50.680 --> 25:56.160\nBut they give you money and they kind of what let you do your thing. Well, that's kind of the reason why okay?\n\n25:56.160 --> 25:59.760\nSo once you see this film you'll realize like holy shit\n\n25:59.760 --> 26:03.720\nWho would have given these people like this amount of money to go make this movie?\n\n26:03.720 --> 26:06.680\nIt's a craze. It was a crazy thing like imagine going to pitch me like alright\n\n26:07.280 --> 26:08.240\nso\n\n26:08.240 --> 26:13.680\nThere's this girl and her best friends this genetically modified pig and gets taken from her and\n\n26:13.680 --> 26:15.240\nAnd\n\n26:15.240 --> 26:17.240\nShe's a she's a visual effect\n\n26:18.960 --> 26:24.000\nGive us like several million dollars to make this but also it's rated R and it's\n\n26:25.280 --> 26:31.880\nThat's the big thing it's like yeah, it's a big giant CG pig that you fall in love with the first moment you see it\n\n26:31.880 --> 26:38.400\nIt's a horrible rated R movie. I mean, I can't even imagine any other studio being like yes\n\n26:38.400 --> 26:45.000\nDirector bong here's a check, but that's why I really think it's a masterpiece and I also like something like what I was watching\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.120\nI was like oh, so this is a snowpiercer guy. I\n\n26:48.120 --> 26:51.160\nStarted watching snowpiercer and then I was like there's tonal\n\n26:52.360 --> 26:56.680\nIncompatibilities with me here. I it's hard enough to write a comedy or an action movie\n\n26:56.680 --> 27:00.600\nI don't want this goofiness happening in my action movies and I kind of like drifted away from it\n\n27:00.600 --> 27:03.920\nI was like I bet that's just the thing when East meets West, you know like filmically and\n\n27:03.920 --> 27:08.800\nThen I when I watched this movie. I was like wait no is this guy like the Coen brothers or\n\n27:09.240 --> 27:16.360\nAnybody else that we put in that category where he's like fucking with us. He deliberately you can he's evolving now\n\n27:16.360 --> 27:23.920\nOr maybe this movie just like makes it clearer that he really deliberately plays with tone in order to take you from laughter to\n\n27:24.600 --> 27:26.600\nHorrible like facing the abyss\n\n27:27.360 --> 27:30.120\nHe's master at that if you've watched any of his other films\n\n27:30.120 --> 27:35.120\nHe did this film called mother and earlier did memories of murder and then he did this Korean film called The Host\n\n27:36.800 --> 27:38.120\nWhich\n\n27:38.120 --> 27:43.160\nThe first time I saw I was like what is this and it's like this horror movie wrapped up in comedic bits and\n\n27:43.840 --> 27:48.440\nOne scene that I feel like wraps for me that wrapped him up was in that particular movie\n\n27:48.440 --> 27:53.540\nHe there's a scene where the father figure is explaining to his kids why\n\n27:54.360 --> 27:59.280\nThe third particular youngest son is like kind of seemingly messed up and doesn't have his life together\n\n27:59.280 --> 28:00.600\nAnd he's like, you know\n\n28:00.600 --> 28:05.280\nWe were so poor when we went when he was little and I couldn't feed him proper protein\n\n28:05.280 --> 28:07.920\nSo that's why your brother's like a little slower than you guys\n\n28:07.920 --> 28:14.260\nAnd he's like really bearing his soul and then the camera pans to the other brother and sister and they're sleeping\n\n28:14.480 --> 28:19.160\nLike it's just like those tonal shifts where he's like trying to open up and be emotional about something\n\n28:19.160 --> 28:24.840\nBut the world is like not hearing it and it kind of reminds me of Alma DeVar\n\n28:24.840 --> 28:31.280\nYou know in that sense that there's like you're living and I don't know how much of that is the effect of watching a foreign film\n\n28:31.280 --> 28:36.160\nThat blends a little comedy with like thought-provoking weird shaky shit\n\n28:37.520 --> 28:43.280\nThat's what I'm trying to figure out as a Western viewer is how much of this is one person's genius\n\n28:43.280 --> 28:48.440\nAnd how much of it is just the weird effect of like a movie\n\n28:48.440 --> 28:55.320\nTranslating across international and if you know anything about director Bong he is like\n\n28:55.320 --> 29:03.760\nI think growing up in Korea which had a very military kind of like regime for a long time when he was growing up like he\n\n29:03.760 --> 29:09.200\nI don't know if he wants me to say this, but he was like arrested for protesting in the 90s and stuff like that\n\n29:09.200 --> 29:13.480\nlike he is intrinsically I think a person who has something to say about\n\n29:13.480 --> 29:18.320\nThe way the system works and kind of fighting against him. This is kind of his way of doing it\n\n29:18.320 --> 29:22.640\nI don't want to put words in his mouth, but that's kind of how I read it this film\n\n29:22.640 --> 29:26.960\nI think the underlying message of course, it's about friendship and\n\n29:27.560 --> 29:30.920\nYou know this little girl and her bringing her family back and like this\n\n29:31.800 --> 29:37.680\nHaving to come to terms with adults and like grow up really quickly in the span of like a week or however long this film takes place\n\n29:37.680 --> 29:40.280\nBut it also has this kind of like\n\n29:40.280 --> 29:43.960\nNot to like the greed and\n\n29:45.040 --> 29:52.000\nHorrible nature of capitalism and right, but you're never preached to that's what I'm trying to figure out how to tell people\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:55.040\nBecause the truth is if I look if I read the description of this on paper\n\n29:55.040 --> 29:57.360\nI wouldn't know I don't think I would I'd be like well\n\n29:57.360 --> 30:02.640\nWhen am I gonna be in the mood to to to be told that every time I eat bacon and something horrible is happening?\n\n30:03.680 --> 30:05.680\nI'll put I'll put that on my list\n\n30:05.680 --> 30:11.080\nYou know and but because I just wandered into this movie inside\n\n30:11.080 --> 30:15.080\nI just like I'm so into I want to tell people you don't have to worry about that it\n\n30:15.680 --> 30:17.680\nIt is heart-wrenching\n\n30:18.280 --> 30:26.760\nBut only in the same way that kind of ET is and it's I guess it's sort of like what if ET was delicious is\n\n30:28.240 --> 30:34.080\nIs the it would just make ET kind of extra you'd be rooting for Elliot to fly a little more\n\n30:34.080 --> 30:38.880\nSpoilers Elliot flies. It's an ET's kind of a piece of shit. This movie is really good\n\n30:39.560 --> 30:43.920\nNow I mean there's there's definitely a lot of like there's it you can sense the there's it\n\n30:44.280 --> 30:50.280\nThere's like a half dozen movies that you could feel a real genuine like influence from without being derivative\n\n30:50.280 --> 30:53.000\nLike you feel this whole ET thing, but you also feel this\n\n30:54.840 --> 30:58.280\nKing Kong like Pete's dragon if you yeah, I\n\n30:58.280 --> 31:05.400\nWould say that a big props though goes to our visual effects supervisor Eric de Boer\n\n31:05.400 --> 31:08.400\nI'm just putting it out there, but he helped create this\n\n31:08.920 --> 31:16.000\nMagnificent creature like I've never I've never worked on a film where we've had this amount of CG where I mean World Wars\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.280\nHe was a different thing\n\n31:17.280 --> 31:23.320\nBut this was like the main character the star of the film is a visual effect\n\n31:23.320 --> 31:29.280\nYeah, so how do you create that bond between this little girl and this made-up creature?\n\n31:30.160 --> 31:37.080\nAnd make it believable and touching and I've seen the movie probably like 20 times now and every single time at the end\n\n31:37.080 --> 31:39.080\nI'm like crying and\n\n31:39.240 --> 31:45.000\nI was kind of remarkable in terms of like I found myself crying because the movie was so good sometimes\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:49.960\nI was like like not because it was sad narratively there there were those times then too we're like you know\n\n31:49.960 --> 31:54.120\nI could hear Cody sniffling and I was like if I look at her that she'll see that I'm crying but\n\n31:55.840 --> 32:03.360\nBut I don't want to oversell it but you know hey everybody go everybody watch this and tell me I'm insane like if I like\n\n32:03.360 --> 32:09.720\nLike if it's not actually like this big a deal of this movie, but like I I found myself near tears\n\n32:10.080 --> 32:11.680\nBecause of the action\n\n32:11.680 --> 32:16.000\nSometimes because I was like yes, this is this is how you do it\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:22.680\nIt's like it's a little it's a little girl and she's like trying to save her pig, but like it's not\n\n32:23.680 --> 32:27.240\nCloyingly like oh, she's a little girl, but she's a power puff girl\n\n32:27.240 --> 32:31.760\nShe's got big strong powers and you love like she's a little girl\n\n32:31.760 --> 32:40.000\nAnd she's really at odds with the physical world and but she just is flinging herself literally and figuratively at this giant machine\n\n32:40.840 --> 32:42.840\ncalled humanity and and\n\n32:42.840 --> 32:48.240\nLike like what I was most impressed by it was like there's these action scenes where\n\n32:49.200 --> 32:55.440\nIf she's chasing it, you know you can see her making decisions about physically what she should try to do next and\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.800\nYou're so you feel like you're playing like an 80s laser\n\n32:58.800 --> 33:04.320\nJust video game or something because you actually are with her and that she's like you know am I gonna try to jump on this\n\n33:04.320 --> 33:08.640\nTrack yeah, I think I should but I didn't it's typically in action movies\n\n33:08.640 --> 33:14.120\nThere's a little bit of suspension of like oh, well how did you know that you were gonna you just you're just\n\n33:14.560 --> 33:17.960\nImprovising and so you decided to jump and now you're gonna land on that truck\n\n33:17.960 --> 33:23.120\nBut it's like there's a slight difference between that and why am I I do this all the time by the way it's called dance-planing I\n\n33:25.080 --> 33:29.400\nI'm a terrible interviewer. I just bring people up and I just talk I coined that yeah\n\n33:30.280 --> 33:36.960\nBut but but do you know from working with him is that a conscious thing when he's doing action that he wants people to track the choices?\n\n33:36.960 --> 33:38.960\nOkay, well\n\n33:39.120 --> 33:44.600\nAnother thing about director bong is he's like a director who've never worked with him before this guy's like remarkably\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nmeticulous in the way he shoots\n\n33:47.280 --> 33:53.360\nSo every sequence or every whatever the entire script is basically storyboarded\n\n33:53.600 --> 33:57.640\nSo I land in Korea and you're basically handed this book of the entire movie\n\n33:57.640 --> 34:00.520\nThat's storyboard and shot for shot like it's it was insane\n\n34:00.520 --> 34:06.200\nAnd then the night before we get our call sheets and with them are the boards for the next day with exactly\n\n34:06.200 --> 34:08.200\nWhat's gonna happen? So\n\n34:08.200 --> 34:13.320\nIt was it was kind of crazy because you already knew and you already knew what it would look like and then you just you know\n\n34:13.320 --> 34:19.840\nYou direct a scene and it was exactly like those boards what what was drawn and a lot of people were like\n\n34:19.840 --> 34:22.080\nOh, you know that does that give you creative freedom or whatever?\n\n34:22.080 --> 34:25.320\nBut it does I think if you hear some of the actors talk about it\n\n34:25.320 --> 34:27.960\nThey're like we knew exactly what we needed to do\n\n34:27.960 --> 34:33.680\nso then we could kind of have freedom within those parameters and then the little girl\n\n34:33.680 --> 34:40.300\nMija who's played by An Tso Hyun was just remarkable. She was this she's like this incredible kid and\n\n34:42.080 --> 34:45.120\nDid everything so beautifully and then like would just go and do it\n\n34:45.120 --> 34:49.640\nShe'd like be playing in the corner and then they'd be like action and then she'd go run run down the street\n\n34:49.640 --> 34:52.000\nYeah, and then he'd be like cut and then she'd be like\n\n34:52.800 --> 34:54.800\nWhere's the snack truck?\n\n34:56.080 --> 35:00.960\nI think people are gonna freak out most about her because people are freaking out about the you know the little girl in Logan\n\n35:00.960 --> 35:05.760\nWho's like so amazing and so striking and she's she's doing so much with so little like dialogue and stuff\n\n35:05.760 --> 35:08.080\nShe's just like glaring at Hugh Jackman and like holding her own\n\n35:08.640 --> 35:15.320\nBut like this little girl is like doing these scenes with Paul Dano who is I've never I was never like hey\n\n35:15.320 --> 35:18.000\nHe signed me up for the Paul Dano fan club. No one or was I a hater?\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:21.560\nI just I would see him and I go who's that guy his face is kind of weird the\n\n35:22.880 --> 35:28.320\nThe but he is fucking amazing. I wanted to marry him like I saw his character\n\n35:28.320 --> 35:32.040\nThat's the other and then the other thing again. I'm doing it again. I'm not asking you anything\n\n35:32.040 --> 35:37.040\nBut but like oh keep going like that character is deeply flawed, but he's so righteous\n\n35:37.160 --> 35:40.440\nAnd it's just it's in his relationship with the girl and I\n\n35:41.880 --> 35:43.200\nI\n\n35:43.200 --> 35:46.480\nLoved the internationality of the story\n\n35:46.480 --> 35:49.960\nI love that it's part of the story that some people speak\n\n35:50.440 --> 35:54.640\nKorean and English some people only speak Korean some people only speak English\n\n35:54.640 --> 35:58.480\nThat was kind of another aspect of the film that we wanted to touch upon\n\n35:58.480 --> 36:05.000\nI think director Bong likes to have these characters that are conflicting like there's this animal liberation front and\n\n36:05.440 --> 36:08.120\nThey're a group with well-intentioned meanings\n\n36:08.840 --> 36:15.880\nYou know wanting to save this pig and expose this evil corporation and how they like had created all these thick\n\n36:15.960 --> 36:19.440\nLike super pigs that are just fucked up and they're having a terrible time\n\n36:19.440 --> 36:25.560\nBut there's there's there's a group of terrorists in the movie and they're the good guys\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.400\nThere really is an ALF like that's not an actual\n\n36:30.760 --> 36:39.040\nActual I think it's it's not like a direct it just happened to be like I think it came from his cousin is like an activist or something\n\n36:39.920 --> 36:41.920\nbut anyway, so\n\n36:41.920 --> 36:49.040\nThey're they themselves are very conflicting characters, especially Steven Young's character who is Korean-American and he speaks\n\n36:49.520 --> 36:52.000\nKorean in the film, but he's like terrible at translating\n\n36:53.120 --> 36:57.040\nHis character is I mean in real life. I'm just kidding\n\n36:57.480 --> 37:02.080\nHe's Korean's really good. His Korean's really good. So like they have these conflicting characters where\n\n37:02.760 --> 37:08.360\nYou know, they have well-intended. Well, you know, they really mean well, but they're kind of like a group of just like\n\n37:08.360 --> 37:12.400\nBumbling idiots at times. Yeah, I mean they're pure of heart\n\n37:12.400 --> 37:17.320\nIt's it's hard to say it's like they're it's that archetype where the people show up and they're kind of like they're goofy\n\n37:17.320 --> 37:23.240\nBut they're heroes in Jake's character. Mm-hmm is like a deeply deeply. I don't know if I don't know if you got that\n\n37:23.240 --> 37:25.240\nBut he's like a deeply flawed\n\n37:25.520 --> 37:30.640\nPerson who started out as like this, you know, Steve Irwin asked kind of like\n\n37:31.200 --> 37:35.480\nAnimal lover and then it has just been beaten down by this woman for the past like\n\n37:35.480 --> 37:42.000\nTilda's character for the past like ten years. He's like the shell of a man who he was and he's just kind of taking it out on\n\n37:42.120 --> 37:47.240\nYeah, let's let's talk about Gyllenhaal for a second bit in this movie who I\n\n37:47.960 --> 37:52.360\nJust because I I want to protect him because I feel like he's making choices in this movie\n\n37:52.360 --> 37:58.120\nThey're so fucking over the top that everyone that I'm afraid maybe I'm wrong about this, but I'm afraid people are gonna go\n\n37:58.120 --> 38:00.120\nWhy is he acting like the Riddler?\n\n38:00.920 --> 38:02.920\nWhen other people aren't doing that\n\n38:02.920 --> 38:08.040\nIt but like what what what kind of conversations does director Bong have with?\n\n38:08.560 --> 38:12.920\nActors do they show up to set and go like I thought I'd try something like this and he's like whatever\n\n38:13.920 --> 38:15.920\nOr or is he like\n\n38:15.920 --> 38:21.640\nLike how hands-on is he so Jake came in like I think we were halfway through our shoot in Korea or so and\n\n38:22.920 --> 38:27.000\nWe were literally on this mountain side at her house\n\n38:27.760 --> 38:31.960\nwhen he comes up the Mountain is like that was like the first day and\n\n38:31.960 --> 38:37.800\nThis it's this beautiful set. It's in the middle of nowhere. You have to like hike down for like 10 minutes\n\n38:38.720 --> 38:40.720\nit's super secluded and\n\n38:42.440 --> 38:44.440\nDirector Bong was just like yeah, so\n\n38:44.840 --> 38:48.000\nYou know he's coming up the thing and maybe he's just really out of breath. So he's like\n\n38:49.640 --> 38:56.400\nAnd you know so he kind of ran with it and then that happened and it kind of just stuck and we you know\n\n38:56.400 --> 39:02.200\nOf course like us being on the other end. We you know, we see those dailies and we're just like um\n\n39:02.720 --> 39:04.720\nDoes anybody want to say anything?\n\n39:05.760 --> 39:08.320\nAnd what does so what does Bong say?\n\n39:09.160 --> 39:12.280\nLike hey, so and you say no, I kind of like it. So then we're like all right\n\n39:12.440 --> 39:17.360\nDo you and we had like this weird trust that it would work out and it did but I'm crazy\n\n39:17.360 --> 39:19.840\nHe stuck with being out of breath as a character choice\n\n39:19.840 --> 39:26.280\nSo when you see the film, I think he is very high-pitched\n\n39:27.240 --> 39:33.760\nDid you see snow piercer? Did you I hate it's not there's there's there's it's a bad movie\n\n39:33.760 --> 39:35.760\nMeet me after the show. I'll explain it to you\n\n39:36.960 --> 39:38.960\nThere's like everybody's like\n\n39:40.720 --> 39:47.000\nTill the Swinton what she's doing in this movie along with John Carlo Esposito who was on community\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nI that's not important, but\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nBut it was kind of also kind of exciting\n\n39:52.800 --> 39:56.520\nThe just the two of them and along with what\n\n39:57.360 --> 39:59.360\ndirector Bong does with\n\n39:59.640 --> 40:05.840\nFoley like in scenes that have no score where they're talking and like till the Swinton is\n\n40:06.680 --> 40:09.360\nLike like doing just the character is like\n\n40:10.480 --> 40:16.920\nSir a totally car a total cartoon and absolutely like rich somehow like like captivating\n\n40:16.920 --> 40:23.480\nMaybe that's just oh you you're pulling out the Ferrari of actors and you're just like like so just cruising around the block feels like\n\n40:23.600 --> 40:30.200\nAn Olympic sport or maybe it there's like but it feels like this incredibly amazing character this performance\n\n40:30.200 --> 40:35.320\nAnd then the John Carlo being like her like attendee and then he like he'll be goes and makes a cup of coffee\n\n40:35.320 --> 40:39.440\nAnd you're just like the the choice of the camera to be everywhere\n\n40:39.440 --> 40:42.680\nIt is at every moment where you watch John Carlo Esposito\n\n40:42.680 --> 40:49.840\nMake a cup of coffee for a second before doing his next line of dialogue and everything is just fully step step step\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nClick pour steams\n\n40:53.320 --> 40:55.320\nYou're thinking you're bringing her to New York\n\n40:55.560 --> 40:59.960\nAnd then that's my favorite. That's one of my favorite part. She goes. I was just about to say that\n\n40:59.960 --> 41:05.200\nAnd I think it's in that scene because like then Gillen Hall is also in that CD comes into it and goes like hey\n\n41:05.200 --> 41:07.200\nthere's what I think and and\n\n41:07.600 --> 41:11.440\nAnd I'm kind of like oh man, I don't want anybody to be punished for enthusiasm\n\n41:11.440 --> 41:17.440\nNo, I think for the way that I like reconciled that in my head was that hit heat his character\n\n41:18.640 --> 41:23.680\nBasically, he like ten years ago was this normal guy and then for ten years\n\n41:23.680 --> 41:25.680\nHe's been playing the role of this\n\n41:25.840 --> 41:31.000\nSpokesperson and having to do all this stuff and he's become a puppet for this corporation that he's almost\n\n41:31.560 --> 41:34.760\nBecome the role that he was just playing and he does say that stuff\n\n41:34.760 --> 41:38.800\nYeah, and then you know and then she even says like quit your whining, right?\n\n41:38.800 --> 41:44.160\nI if I if I was in the edit bay, no one needs my help on this movie. It's a masterpiece\n\n41:44.320 --> 41:47.880\nBut I did say I was like well put your money where your mouth is Harmon\n\n41:47.880 --> 41:51.640\nIf I was in the edit bay and I had all that footage and I had one pickup shot\n\n41:51.640 --> 41:57.600\nI would just have one shot where we were just where Gillen Hall's character does a little anal nitrate\n\n41:58.920 --> 42:00.920\nLike he just does one popper\n\n42:00.920 --> 42:07.880\nUm, like like like like or there's something weird some weird thing like like like huffs something or well, you know\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nThat would have been helpful like three months ago\n\n42:11.680 --> 42:14.360\nBut it's not yeah, I mean it's yeah, so\n\n42:14.960 --> 42:17.920\nBut so the movie like this is the thing like I\n\n42:18.560 --> 42:25.320\nIt's okay to say he's not a vegetarian, right? No, he he helped write he conceived of this movie and\n\n42:25.920 --> 42:28.120\nThen shot the entire thing\n\n42:28.120 --> 42:35.960\nI everyone that watches this movie for at least 48 hours is is not you know, you're gonna just not have\n\n42:36.440 --> 42:44.880\nSausage. Yeah, I remember being in a in a meeting earlier on after we were doing some scouting and we were watching some research footage of\n\n42:45.720 --> 42:49.280\nThere's a there's a scene where they're I don't want to like give it away\n\n42:49.280 --> 42:54.000\nBut they're dealing with animals in a certain way and so it's based that that scene\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:58.400\nIs based off of a real how they actually\n\n42:59.600 --> 43:05.240\nTreat cattle. Well, of course. Yeah, we figure. Yeah, and and I was sitting in this meeting and he was like, oh\n\n43:05.240 --> 43:09.680\nI want to show you this research clip and we were like I was like, oh god\n\n43:09.680 --> 43:13.400\nAnd I was sitting there trying to hide that I was crying\n\n43:14.120 --> 43:16.120\nlike in a room\n\n43:16.800 --> 43:18.500\nProducers and other\n\n43:18.500 --> 43:20.160\nActual like actual footage of yeah\n\n43:20.160 --> 43:24.520\nI was actual footage of cattle being led to their slaughter essentially and they like\n\n43:25.040 --> 43:28.080\nRecoiling kind of knowing like they were headed into something dangerous\n\n43:28.720 --> 43:33.760\nAnd it was like the worst thing I'd ever seen and I was like I don't want to eat anything after I had a couple friends\n\n43:33.760 --> 43:39.520\nAnd I can't say their names because they might still be like the ALF animal liberation front was on FBI's\n\n43:39.520 --> 43:41.520\nLike most wanted list and it might still be\n\n43:42.240 --> 43:44.240\nand they would go into\n\n43:44.240 --> 43:49.760\na meat processing plants and animal testing labs and take the footage and\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:54.080\nAnd I would tell people like I'm vegetarian\n\n43:54.080 --> 43:55.680\nI don't preach it people should eat what they want to eat\n\n43:55.680 --> 43:59.240\nBut there's a couple things if you don't want to eat meat don't watch this tape\n\n43:59.240 --> 44:06.640\nYeah, and there's footage that's so absolutely compelling and so horrifying and that's the thing that I want to make clear only because\n\n44:07.080 --> 44:09.940\ncreatively this movie deserves so much\n\n44:09.940 --> 44:17.660\nRecognition for what it's somehow pulling off and I have no idea how it's doing it. How is it that part of the movie?\n\n44:18.460 --> 44:23.940\nEverything that I've said, you know, you're you're imagining like oh, I understand the idea is like like Lisa Simpson\n\n44:23.940 --> 44:27.900\nShe sees the movie and it's like gross and it's like you don't want to eat meat anymore\n\n44:27.900 --> 44:29.660\nBut it's like it's not\n\n44:29.660 --> 44:31.660\nsomehow it doesn't\n\n44:31.660 --> 44:34.660\ngross you out it doesn't make you\n\n44:34.660 --> 44:43.420\nIt doesn't spank you as a meat eater for 40 years, but it just somehow invites you up\n\n44:43.420 --> 44:45.820\nI think that's the point and we didn't want to\n\n44:46.860 --> 44:51.260\nfor us at least our intention is to never be like\n\n44:51.940 --> 44:55.020\nPreachy about anything. We just want to show you a different\n\n44:55.980 --> 45:01.180\nView of something and be like kind of like hey, this is how it is make your own decisions\n\n45:01.180 --> 45:08.140\nBut we would like to to show you a different side of the truth that maybe you don't you aren't familiar with and that's kind of\n\n45:08.140 --> 45:10.940\nThat's a really extraordinary mind at work on his part\n\n45:10.940 --> 45:17.980\nIt's like it would he be a better person if he didn't eat meat sure so would I but since he does enjoy bacon at breakfast\n\n45:18.220 --> 45:20.220\nhim making that decision\n\n45:20.560 --> 45:23.060\nartistically what I'm gonna do is I'm going to\n\n45:24.740 --> 45:29.420\nPut my camera on this side of this of that story that issue that that\n\n45:29.420 --> 45:31.900\nProbably and and I'm gonna do that faithfully\n\n45:31.900 --> 45:37.940\nHe just wanted to do that creatively and it no and then he just finished the movie and he ordered some sausage and\n\n45:39.340 --> 45:42.460\nThat to me it may it may not make any of us good people\n\n45:42.460 --> 45:43.960\nBut it certainly makes him a genius\n\n45:43.960 --> 45:50.180\nYeah, you know actually I think when he went on his research trips to he actually like visited some slaughterhouses\n\n45:50.180 --> 45:55.140\nI think he couldn't think the whole crew that went on that trip couldn't touch meat for a while because it was like\n\n45:55.260 --> 45:57.260\nthere's something about\n\n45:57.260 --> 45:59.260\nthe smell and\n\n45:59.300 --> 46:05.900\nThere's also different levels of we're talking about like you know there you I imagine there's people that have different levels of issue with different\n\n46:05.900 --> 46:08.620\nIt's like there's probably people in the audience that\n\n46:09.580 --> 46:15.140\npersonally eat meat, but also recognize that there's perhaps like an industrial problem where we\n\n46:16.140 --> 46:21.100\nWe we were doing it wrong the system is built wrong. We're over addicted to me\n\n46:21.100 --> 46:25.180\nWe we we should make it more expensive and it should be always\n\n46:25.180 --> 46:27.180\na\n\n46:27.220 --> 46:29.780\nProcessed in a in a in a way that a more\n\n46:30.580 --> 46:35.460\nShooting with a bow and arrow and praying over its carcass in the forest. Yes. That's exactly what\n\n46:38.220 --> 46:42.260\nBut what about you by the way, I never asked you like are you a vegetarian? I\n\n46:43.620 --> 46:44.900\nHave\n\n46:44.900 --> 46:50.700\nMade a kind of decision to try and do the pescatarian thing for a while because after actually after having work on this\n\n46:50.700 --> 46:52.620\nI need pork for the entire thing\n\n46:52.620 --> 46:58.380\nIt's just there's something about piggies and what about crustaceans. I actually don't like\n\n46:59.460 --> 47:03.340\nChelfish or Christy that that's not yeah, I'm off of them since New Orleans\n\n47:04.420 --> 47:10.620\nJust ate too much. This is brought a brown bowl of it looked like HR Giger like made of\n\n47:12.020 --> 47:17.700\nIt was just like everything is just like the eyes of the face and it had an expression on its face\n\n47:17.700 --> 47:23.100\nAnd I wasn't a human and it wasn't I wasn't like oh this poor this poor this poor jumbo shrimp like\n\n47:23.500 --> 47:27.580\nThat's the exact face. They make right before they died. It just freezes. It's what they know\n\n47:27.580 --> 47:31.980\nThey're like you're gonna I'm gonna be served to the guy that's not even gonna appreciate me. I'm a hearty\n\n47:33.100 --> 47:37.660\nBut what a terrible death. Oh you killed me and the guy didn't fucking dig it\n\n47:37.660 --> 47:42.180\nYeah, yeah, but but it was never like because they put a bib on you and\n\n47:43.260 --> 47:46.500\nBut it's like I look over at Cody and she's like yeah\n\n47:46.500 --> 47:53.580\nYou can't you know, but I don't know but I'm like what did you do I looked it out of the bowl just and I just it's curled up\n\n47:54.420 --> 47:57.940\nAnd then you uncur as you uncurl it the legs go\n\n47:58.620 --> 48:03.060\nlike that and then juice goes everywhere and then\n\n48:03.540 --> 48:07.140\nYou just like well, do I eat the face off and then squeeze?\n\n48:07.140 --> 48:13.500\nI think you're supposed to like my mouth like rip the head off and then suck the head suck the head she says sorry\n\n48:13.500 --> 48:20.500\nYeah, I think but at the end of the day, I just peeled it like a hard-boiled egg down to a big jumbo shrimp\n\n48:20.500 --> 48:22.820\nAnd then ate it was like yeah, it's fucking shrimp, bro\n\n48:23.940 --> 48:25.940\nDon't make it shaped like an insect\n\n48:25.940 --> 48:29.940\nBut you but you we're talking about you don't like when you get meat on the bone\n\n48:29.940 --> 48:32.660\nYou don't like to have to do the work. Yeah, you want it to be done for you\n\n48:32.660 --> 48:39.260\nAnd I would definitely if we were living in a proper kind of caveman tribe you die\n\n48:39.260 --> 48:41.260\nI would know I would be a vegetarian\n\n48:41.260 --> 48:45.300\nI would I would be like, okay, I'll you know, I wrote a play for you guys\n\n48:45.300 --> 48:52.340\nCan I have a piece of brisket and and if the alpha was like no you got a you got to kill what you eat\n\n48:52.340 --> 48:54.820\nWhat you kill a big then I'll have a salad they like\n\n48:55.700 --> 49:01.820\nI don't like your attitude like and good good luck with your the obvious analogy for your care\n\n49:01.820 --> 49:07.540\nYou're your character in my play. What do you think would be what do you think would be in your kick in your caveman salad?\n\n49:07.540 --> 49:10.900\nWhat would that consist of arugula and parmesan?\n\n49:13.340 --> 49:16.820\nJust because I like that at little Dom's that's one thing about the caveman\n\n49:16.820 --> 49:19.860\nI don't really appreciate is how good they were at making aged cheese\n\n49:23.620 --> 49:27.660\nBut Christina like so, how did you get that you your producer you work for plan B?\n\n49:27.660 --> 49:34.780\nI how long you've been there a little over six years.

I was like shipped away on a scout location scout\n\n50:08.540 --> 50:14.460\nFor like days. I forgot the connection was plan B, which is Brad Pitt's company, which is hilarious\n\n50:14.460 --> 50:16.900\nHe's the CEO of isn't he like\n\n50:17.900 --> 50:26.380\nYeah, is he is he always eating when he comes into meetings or is that only for as an acting choice like it's like, you know\n\n50:26.380 --> 50:34.340\nNo, he likes to eat because he started like as soon as it appears as soon as he got a say in what he gets to do on camera\n\n50:34.340 --> 50:36.660\nHe was he obviously started saying it's an actor\n\n50:36.660 --> 50:40.020\nCould I be eating something watch watch any Brad Pitt movie with the sound off?\n\n50:40.020 --> 50:43.940\nHe moves his head a lot and he points a lot a lot of pointing a lot of\n\n50:43.940 --> 50:45.940\nI\n\n50:52.700 --> 50:56.580\nGeorge Clooney has like a weird like George Clooney's head always like I got a swivel\n\n50:56.580 --> 51:01.220\nIt's like he's bobbing.

Will you be my Peabody later on? Yeah, is\n\n54:35.540 --> 54:37.900\nProduction your ambition or are you\n\n54:38.940 --> 54:46.420\nTransitioning like is this is helping out in a production capacity like is it the end all be all or is it a means to know?\n\n54:46.420 --> 54:48.420\nOf course like I would be a producer\n\n54:49.340 --> 54:53.180\nWithout the executive in front of it, but that's why it's not you know\n\n54:53.180 --> 54:58.660\nIt's not and then I'll be a director or then I'll leave that to people that are far more talented than I'm glad you said that\n\n54:58.660 --> 55:02.580\nBecause we have directors and writers appear all the time that we go like what's your advice?\n\n55:02.580 --> 55:05.380\nBut it's like we have so few like Steve Levy my assistant\n\n55:05.380 --> 55:09.620\nHe he wants to be a producer and like ten years ago. I'd be like no way\n\n55:09.620 --> 55:12.460\nThat's not an ambition. Fuck you suits are evil\n\n55:12.700 --> 55:17.900\nWhatever and I would have and then I would have gone on to get fired by everybody and no one likes me\n\n55:17.900 --> 55:25.500\nAnd I they're like why do you keep calling us suits? I think people I think people don't really know what a producer does right like producers are fucking important as\n\n55:26.740 --> 55:28.020\nAF\n\n55:28.020 --> 55:30.020\nTo put it in your language\n\n55:34.620 --> 55:40.260\nThey are as they're important a AF yeah, yeah, I well I switched over I switched it was like\n\n55:40.820 --> 55:44.580\nGen X to millennial like it's like Spanglish. I was like as AF\n\n55:45.300 --> 55:52.300\nAll right, but no, but it's like saying like like like pin number you can you can choose how much gender mustard\n\n55:52.300 --> 55:54.300\nYou want to put on this you can either answer this\n\n55:54.300 --> 56:00.820\nFor the young ladies in the audience as a woman the interest in a production or you can just answer it as a human being\n\n56:01.820 --> 56:04.220\nThat also you can do both at the same time\n\n56:04.220 --> 56:20.780\nYou you guys are gonna go home tonight and realize that meant nothing. I\n\n56:21.980 --> 56:23.980\nAm not a villain\n\n56:24.620 --> 56:26.620\nAnd that was not a hero\n\n56:27.660 --> 56:29.660\nYou'll figure it out later\n\n56:29.660 --> 56:34.820\nWhatever I forgive you for you know not what you do\n\n56:36.260 --> 56:38.260\nBut yeah, I mean if it's\n\n56:38.620 --> 56:42.860\nLike like people out there that are going I want to work in production like what are they?\n\n56:43.140 --> 56:46.980\nHow and what are the obstacles any pieces of advice whatever take it?\n\n56:49.660 --> 56:51.660\nWhy thank you\n\n56:53.500 --> 56:55.500\nThere is no like\n\n56:55.500 --> 57:01.100\nDo this and then do this and then do this and then you're a producer if anyone ever tells you that they're lying to you\n\n57:01.620 --> 57:03.620\nI did an internship\n\n57:04.500 --> 57:06.500\nworked my ass off and\n\n57:06.820 --> 57:11.300\nVery serendipitously landed at this company people hear that maybe some people are going okay\n\n57:11.300 --> 57:16.460\nSo what how do you what do you open the yellow pages you Google yellow pages? Yeah, you find out what yellow pages mean?\n\n57:17.460 --> 57:23.180\nLike like what you like really get granular about like what do you do from Massachusetts?\n\n57:23.180 --> 57:28.100\nLike what the first step where you go like I'm gonna like start you have to have kind of\n\n57:29.420 --> 57:31.420\nslightly\n\n57:31.940 --> 57:36.380\nImpressive Asian parents that want you to be a doctor or a teacher\n\n57:36.380 --> 57:42.300\nMm-hmm, and then but you secretly have to want to do something a little bit. I mean I oh happy father's day dad\n\n57:42.300 --> 57:44.300\nI love you\n\n57:44.660 --> 57:48.660\nActually my dad wanted to be a film director, but then gave everything up and\n\n57:48.660 --> 57:52.740\nDon't you have to call him father dad in your car? Yes, father? Oh\n\n57:53.860 --> 58:00.220\nThe father wanted to be a film director, and he actually went to film school in Korea in I don't know\n\n58:01.300 --> 58:06.020\n70s, and then he immigrated to America to give us a better opportunity\n\n58:06.380 --> 58:09.100\nSo to speak but then how do you get to be an intern on it?\n\n58:09.100 --> 58:15.340\nYeah, so then so then I like moved to Arizona went to school and Scott stupor was an alumni at that stupor\n\n58:15.340 --> 58:17.340\nI know he doesn't do anything\n\n58:17.340 --> 58:24.220\nHe's like he just he's at Netflix now. He sounds like an Archie comic character. That's great\n\n58:24.220 --> 58:27.340\nHe's he's he's super lovely, and I interned at his company out of\n\n58:28.260 --> 58:32.700\nCollege in my last semester. Is there a bulletin board?\n\n58:33.940 --> 58:39.300\nUniversity of Phoenix is there what what was the University of Arizona? Okay? Yeah\n\n58:39.300 --> 58:44.460\nYeah, no, he was an alum there\n\n58:44.460 --> 58:50.660\nSo he had this like premiere internship program that you had to apply for and and then I got it and I\n\n58:50.820 --> 58:54.580\nWent and you work for free for four months, and then\n\n58:55.580 --> 58:57.860\nIt opens doors for you, I suppose\n\n58:58.420 --> 59:04.140\nBut if anybody okay if anybody actually is interested or wants to know I guess come find me afterwards because I\n\n59:04.140 --> 59:10.100\nDon't do that to yourself, okay, but but but no, but I feel like it'll be like because sometimes people are like\n\n59:10.100 --> 59:13.580\nWhat do I do? What do I do? Can I be an intern on on your show?\n\n59:13.580 --> 59:17.900\nCan I be a PA and all the stuff and I'm like I don't I'm not I never did that\n\n59:17.900 --> 59:22.460\nYeah, and so I would say interning interning is a great thing be a PA\n\n59:22.460 --> 59:29.420\nbut it's just like kind of like my thing is be nice to everyone and introduce yourself and like be a cool person and\n\n59:29.820 --> 59:33.260\nThings will happen if you're an asshole like I immediately I'm like\n\n59:33.260 --> 59:39.380\nI don't want to talk to this how do you sustain yourself like when you were like people like that have internships like you you're\n\n59:39.380 --> 59:42.900\nYou're not being paid for your work like were you broke back then or did you have a yeah?\n\n59:42.900 --> 59:51.140\nI lived I my parents helped me of course. Thank you, but I like lived with this old Korean couple\n\n59:51.140 --> 59:57.580\nThey were super nice. I like had a I stayed in a bedroom at their place that they like kind of randomly knew my parents\n\n59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.740\nand I just stayed in a lot and I didn't\n\n01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:06.300\nEat a lot of rice and kimchi. You're so racist right now\n\n01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:14.780\nBut that's the thing like like you hear about like like a lot of people that get to become like you know like you turn on the news\n\n01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:18.940\nAnd everyone's a journalist that they're all rich people they because they could afford to be yeah\n\n01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:23.900\nI think if they could afford to spend three years unpaid labor as as interns and doing the stuff\n\n01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.140\nBut you like you actually just like\n\n01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:32.620\nLived you squatted with an old couple and didn't eat much except you know like basic food. Well, I did I did I mean like I\n\n01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:36.280\nDid eat because otherwise I'd be a lot skinnier, but\n\n01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:43.420\nNo, I do think like I I knew when I needed help and I was like listen like I want to do this like how do I\n\n01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:50.640\nDo this in my school was really cool and helpful and I did I did thankfully find this couple which was kind of odd like\n\n01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:57.760\nIt was in a weird bedroom in Koreatown and there was a fridge in my room. I didn't really understand like a full-size fridge\n\n01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.760\nDid you ever look inside of it? It was empty?\n\n01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.760\nYeah, I lived in Koreatown when I first moved to LA\n\n01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:10.920\nThere was a murderer in the alley behind my house, and I'll tell you that bad\n\n01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.280\nBut yeah, we should talk later. It doesn't sound like\n\n01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:19.760\nI mean, I guess I guess it helped that I am Korean so it was it made a little bit of sense\n\n01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.320\nI don't I'm sure the guy that got murdered was Korean. I don't know\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.680\nI'm just assuming\n\n01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:30.320\nBut but but you know it is it is it is difficult and I think like the difference now\n\n01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:37.880\nI think is a lot of internships actually do pay you. Oh, yeah. Yeah, what's next for producer? Oh, what's next for plan B?\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.840\nIf they're the same thing you can answer as a woman or a Korean\n\n01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.840\nI\n\n01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.080\nActually, I actually became a\n\n01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:55.560\nActually through this whole experience. I I became friends with Steven young this\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.560\nHe's an awesome awesome dude\n\n01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:03.880\nAnd so I think we are gonna try and cook something up and then we're working on a film\n\n01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.680\nJames Gray's next film right now. We just wrapped a film called beautiful boy\n\n01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.400\ndirected by Felix von Groningen, which is gonna be a\n\n01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.520\nIt's kind of it's gonna be like a little sad, but\n\n01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.480\nWell, it's 9-11 everybody. Let's hear it for Christina. Oh\n\n01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.040\nBut not those things aren't related\n\n01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.960\nThank you, Christina. Oh, we're talking about\n\n01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:37.680\nOh, yeah, what's it Winston on June 28 next Wednesday\n\n01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.320\nSo right now you're saying Dean is a there's been a shift in the show you're wearing a foam\n\n01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:53.280\nSuper pig on your head. It seems like a harbinger of some sort of new aspect to our to our program\n\n01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.120\nAnd also you dismissed your guest like some kind of weird handmade\n\n01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.160\npatriarch\n\n01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.760\nYou sent her off. Why would that be?\n\n01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:07.000\nWell, because as promised like this is finally it after much fucking to do\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.760\nWe're we're gonna we're gonna play our new Pathfinder campaign\n\n01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:22.160\nThank you, I think you might have jumped a gun on the music I just wanted to give it a sting\n\n01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.160\nOh, okay, cuz I think well\n\n01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:30.040\nLet's let's let's let's see if this experiment can work or we we take a break for the for the mid-roll ad that the people\n\n01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.360\nThat pay five dollars a month don't have to listen to and instead\n\n01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:39.640\nThe people listening to the ad on the free version of the podcast don't get to hear the following. I\n\n01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.120\nYou know, we don't actually have to do anything cuz no one will know I\n\n01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:57.640\nThink they'll know and they'll get on reddit and they're not gonna say nothing. These guys are too cool to be on reddit\n\n01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:08.160\nLet's just talk shit about reddit during the night. Yeah, they hate reddit is like the Arizona of Sites\n\n01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:23.440\nIt's a great Arizona is a great state to go to if you hate women Mexicans and gay people and front lawns\n\n01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.720\nBut you love gravel\n\n01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:33.280\nTheir front lawns are gravel look you hear your statements bear no fucking gravitas right now. You got a phone\n\n01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:38.400\nI know what to I know what to do during art. This is still during art. This is still our special break\n\n01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.560\nLet me show because this will just be for people that are\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nCaptain we're going warp factor seven\n\n01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.280\nThe actor his eyes\n\n01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:02.400\nDo you guys think LeVar Burton like did you even listen to that episode it did something happen during that show that would explain\n\n01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:08.420\nLeVar Burton not only not showing up to my wedding, but also just kind of generally. I don't know. I feel like I\n\n01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.080\nThink he's on ear wolf now. Maybe it's an ear wolf beef\n\n01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:23.120\nOkay, can I think he is can you pull up the I got my iPhone plugged into the feed\n\n01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:31.160\nAnd because I just wanted to show these you might have seen these I retweeted this picture. These are those meat torture videos. These are the\n\n01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:37.320\nThis is the this is the photo of the there are the protesters that were outside Shakespeare in the park\n\n01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.920\nThis guy's got a little sign that says boo the cast and\n\n01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:48.800\nThis guy and don't be don't don't be fooled into thinking this is a crowd. These are just two pictures. We're just\n\n01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:54.480\nThis this guy is behind this lady in the first so\n\n01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.880\nIt's just Spielberg here with his pro-trump far left. It's America\n\n01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.840\nSo the weird thing is I retweeted that and then somebody like that had tweeted it\n\n01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:10.240\nThey're like hey respect my investigative journalism because what I found out is that this person was saying this\n\n01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.680\nI followed this like kind of sub thread and they were like\n\n01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:21.000\nThis guy was outside the fucking Hamilton show in New York. It's the same guy\n\n01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.760\nwith the same sign\n\n01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:30.880\nSame font same as a do you do you think that he\n\n01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:36.400\nLike Cody Cody said oh man if his son breaks his arm he can stand up at the hospital again triple\n\n01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:43.880\nBut I don't know why you wouldn't want to cheer that cast or because it's an Obamacare cast\n\n01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.760\nOr if he becomes a ghost\n\n01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:55.640\nBut this guy said now it's like a question of is he so he definitely went from a boring villain to an interesting villain\n\n01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.960\nBut kid if he goes to it. Well, what could he do with the sign to make him the world shittiest hero?\n\n01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:07.000\nBut what's his angle? He hates the cast because they're being lefties or what well\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.360\nYou know the Shakespeare in the park thing, you know, they did Julius Caesar and they they it's like look you when you do Julius Caesar\n\n01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:16.680\nYou you you pick a fucking wardrobe you pick an angle they go\n\n01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:22.920\nOh, let's make them 1920s gangsters other thing and they did an Obama thing where they Julius Caesar was an African-American man and they\n\n01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:28.920\nThey they and this this time they they give him a big long red tie and like blonde hair\n\n01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:34.400\nAnd so then it was like we all know that these people aren't\n\n01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:41.320\nActually offended and don't they're just playing this fucking a weird game of hungry hungry hippos with us like where it's like\n\n01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.920\nThey just like they're just like I don't know that was a game from 1849\n\n01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:50.140\nIt's just so fucking weird, but I don't want to get sidetracked by that because we were we all spend our days\n\n01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.920\nWhere was this taken? This is also in New York\n\n01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:58.160\nThis is no well wait. Where's Shakespeare in the park?

Yeah, I'm really just trying to set the table\n\n01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.280\nShould we start yeah, yeah hit it\n\n01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.400\nAll right\n\n01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.600\nThe town of Rowan has been in peril a letter from the local priory\n\n01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:20.160\nDetails of village under siege by evil the prior says heresy and evil have taken root in the town and demons and evil spirits have\n\n01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:27.520\nBeen inflicting the town's folk they've begged for aid in the past and they've lost contact with both of the clergyman\n\n01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:35.560\nWho are sent to investigate the prior fears for the lives of his congregation and seeks the aid of the church militants in\n\n01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:40.160\nRooting out the source of the evil and saving the village from its sin\n\n01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:46.680\nAll right, yeah, I didn't get a lot of that because I couldn't I realized oh shit. There's gonna be notes\n\n01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.680\nIt's a classic trend of yours\n\n01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:54.120\nIt's good. So let's start by asking questions. Do you have any questions?\n\n01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.160\nQuestions may be generating from the fact that you didn't hear some of this\n\n01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.040\nI got a I got a letter yes from my\n\n01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:13.280\nSuperior or some you know some bureaucrat within my church said go to this town right this town is\n\n01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:20.200\nLanguishing from evil right there's evil taking root in this town and it's affecting our towns folk\n\n01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.840\nWhat's the town's name row and or Roan roan? I think that's just Roan right sure\n\n01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.360\nI mean I invented the I mean, that's a word. Yeah, let's move past I\n\n01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.520\nWrote her down to W. So let's just call it Rowan. I mean whatever I\n\n01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.800\nActually, yeah, no, I don't think you writing it down wrong should change the name. Yeah, you can't do that\n\n01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:48.360\nYou were you were waffling on your own decision pull the pronunciation to be sure\n\n01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:53.600\nYes, that doesn't open you up. This is what I'm talking about. Dungeon Dungeon topping from the bottom of the dungeon\n\n01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:01.760\nNo, it's great. Everyone's great. Alright, so you guys you're in like a horse-drawn wagon together\n\n01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.840\nBecause you've been you're you've been dispatched on this mission.

Yeah, you know, but I'm I'm I'm I think I'm pretty grown up now\n\n01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.800\nI got it's I I feel weird that we're equals like we're basically the same kind of\n\n01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:55.040\nStatus like in the church like I think of you as kind of a hero. You're my mentor\n\n01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.040\nBut now we're working side-by-side as a team\n\n01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.440\nHi, don't don't I mean it's good to just say that stuff don't\n\n01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.520\nDon't carry shame around with you\n\n01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.400\nYou know, just keep yourself pure\n\n01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:13.320\nI admit to my jealousy like I teach young kids how to be\n\n01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:19.040\nAdept at the arts of the silver flame and I you know when I see them\n\n01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.680\nRise and stature faster than I've ever been able to I\n\n01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:28.080\nGet I get jealous now that I've got us that you kind of get in your own way a lot\n\n01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:34.120\nLike, you know, you could have been top dog. You just you you you kind of self sabotage yourself a lot\n\n01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.840\nYeah, I mean and now you're being a dick and\n\n01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:44.320\nBut if I know and the key is which of us is more self\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\ninspecting and which of us is saying\n\n01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.640\nAnd the answer that person\n\n01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.080\nOkay, let's look. Let's let's let's just drop it. Yeah, I clearly\n\n01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.760\nClearly it's a lot of baggage there. I know this church is fucked up\n\n01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.760\nYou know when it's fucked up church is the reason why we're here like what we're trying to purify ourselves and purify the world of evil\n\n01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.240\nThe religion is the reason we're here the church is fucked\n\n01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.760\nFrom the head down by people that believe more in politics than religion. Okay. Well, let's not talk\n\n01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.760\nCan we have one wagon ride where we're not doing this?\n\n01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:23.520\nI'm just concerned for the people of Roan\n\n01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.360\nIt's pronounced Rowan, but that's cool\n\n01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.680\nHow far out do you think we are?\n\n01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.320\nDriver\n\n01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.320\nYou're the driver\n\n01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.560\nHello, what? Oh\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.400\nI'm driving. Yeah, it's just like a horse\n\n01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.440\nJesus\n\n01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.840\nCarlos, are you drunk?\n\n01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.800\nVoice in my head. I thought maybe was the silver flame said you're the driver and I\n\n01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:01.400\nThought it meant I if you've been drinking you just you're supposed to put the reins to the wagon in the bowl by the door\n\n01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:06.960\nAnd like somebody else drives the wagon. It's okay. It looks like Rowan's I\n\n01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.040\nLook ahead on the road. What do I see?\n\n01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:16.360\nAll right, the road is rough and bumpy out in the countryside and the rolling hills look endless and foreboding in the dreary\n\n01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.040\nGray of the darkening clouded sky\n\n01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:26.120\nFollowing an even smaller winding road to your left takes you off off the main path and into the\n\n01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:33.200\nAnd into the gentler yellow planes that give way to fenced plots of fallowed farmlands\n\n01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.400\nThat's like farmlands without crops in them the edge of town\n\n01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:44.840\nThis must be the edge of town aside from a single small house and barn near one of these farm plots and to darkened\n\n01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:51.640\nRuined kind of burnt-looking structures. No real buildings or civilization are found this far out\n\n01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.040\nIt seems like way down the way\n\n01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.400\nThere's there's a bit more of a town\n\n01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:02.440\nBut you really only see in these kind of three buildings on this on this path and it's kind of getting towards evening\n\n01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.440\nmaybe we should stop here and\n\n01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:09.160\nAnd let's look the horses rest and maybe give them some something to eat some water\n\n01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:15.280\nLet's see if there's any people around that can give us information the kind we won't get once we're in the confines of the city\n\n01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.840\nThe three buildings are a barn a farmhouse. What else? Well, you see a farm in a barn house or\n\n01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.400\nBarn in a farmhouse. There we go\n\n01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:28.680\nThat are right next to each other and then across like you're on a road\n\n01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.880\nAnd then that's on to say the left side of the road and then on the right side of the road\n\n01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.320\nYou just see two kind of burnt-out husks of buildings. Whoa\n\n01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.120\nEasy\n\n01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:47.080\nWe leave the wagon into the barn, okay, so\n\n01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.400\nAll right, yeah\n\n01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:56.240\nNo, you go you roll up towards the barn and you can see there's light coming from inside the farmhouse\n\n01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.760\nAnd the barns closed for the night. Oh, it's nighttime already in sundown\n\n01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:03.920\nWell, it's it's like getting dark, but the barns magic hour\n\n01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.360\nYeah, that if that's established and sure\n\n01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:13.000\nIt might be magic. I I kind of quietly walk up and\n\n01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:20.240\nTo a window at the farmhouse. Okay. Wait. Oh, sorry. So we just established. What do you guys look like? I?\n\n01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:25.920\nMean we can establish that later, but I don't know. I'm a gnome druid\n\n01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:32.120\nYeah, I'm a short little fellow. I carry a walking magical quarter staff\n\n01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:38.720\nThat has secret powers and my name is Chad the fire liker. I'm a gnome druid, right?\n\n01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.920\nAnd I you know I'm dressed druidic\n\n01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:47.000\nI've kind of brightly colored hair and a brightly colored outfit. I'm a little eccentric your colorful gnome man\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nYeah, sure\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nI'm a human\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.200\nI'm a human size medium. I\n\n01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.400\nAm I'm wearing a\n\n01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.840\nDirty robe\n\n01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:06.400\nRight, so that's like church clothes kind of but your clothes are probably not like church clothes\n\n01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.120\nThey're like colorful.

I mean I I I you know, I\n\n01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:34.120\nWell, whatever happened a good old turning of the undead, you know, I'm a cleric like that's that's a feet. You'll get next level\n\n01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.960\nHe's a yeah, and I I a ghost is traditionally undead\n\n01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:42.200\nOh, well, but but if when he's in the dude, he wasn't like\n\n01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.200\nUh, I mean\n\n01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.400\nUm, I said you may be making assumptions that aren't based in reality\n\n01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000\nThat's a catch all right\n\n01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:57.320\nI can't answer that question without giving you a hint Carlos\n\n01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:01.160\nHe just walked through a ghost before you hit that child. Well, he didn't hit the yeah\n\n01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:04.280\nYou almost hit a child, but thank god that ghost came out\n\n01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:10.040\nAll right, well, I don't want to do too much metagaming, but I think it might be an illusion\n\n01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:14.440\nThis is what it may be like like this isn't I don't think everything is what it seems\n\n01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.600\nI I I'm gonna punch the kid anyway\n\n01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:30.280\nSo you step through the ghost and you deck the kid the ghost or the kid is still laughing like\n\n01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:35.400\nAnd you deck the kid and he and he he you hit him pretty hard\n\n01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.120\nHe um\n\n01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:40.120\nI'm not proud of it right\n\n01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:46.040\nWell, you can be um, he takes four damage and you can see his face start to swell and he goes\n\n01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:54.040\nAnd the ghost uh the ghost that came out starts like grabbing on you and you can feel its coldness\n\n01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.680\nBut it can't hurt you for whatever reason\n\n01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.800\nThe ghost might be good\n\n01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:05.320\nThe ghost might be good I gotta yell something out at you\n\n01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.320\nUh\n\n01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:10.040\nI I go over and I I hit the kid too\n\n01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:15.800\nThe ghost the ghost is protecting the kid\n\n01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:22.600\nThe ghost is protecting the kid the kids possessed by a demon right the ghost is undead and is but\n\n01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:29.400\nIt is out in front of the kid and and not and the kid is like still has a demon in him or something\n\n01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:35.880\nRight, so I I think it seemed like we're making progress by hitting this kid\n\n01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:45.640\nYou're always making some sort of progress. I wait I wait for my turn. Okay. Well, that will be after I I I pass\n\n01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:50.440\nI I go to the kid I raise my fist like I'm gonna hit him\n\n01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:52.280\nAll right\n\n01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:56.280\nSo then the the ghost boy jumps off at dan and starts grappling onto you\n\n01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.400\nBut again, it can't really do much. You can just feel like cold ghost fingers touching you and it's real creepy\n\n01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:04.200\num, and then the demon boy is like\n\n01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.760\nAnd he starts vomiting all over the place. Um\n\n01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:13.320\nSo you guys got to make reflex saves.
