00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
From beautiful Uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Spencer Crittenden.

00:19.000 --> 00:30.000
What's in that bag? Special stuff in that bag. I don't know, man.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Wow, I think it's a new lighting setup, right?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
I'm assuming the microphone's further back because it's part of a new lighting setup?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I don't know.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Why do I always start the show in the worst fucking way?

00:50.000 --> 00:58.000
Not just the worst way, but just specifically in, like, really wondering about whether the microphone's position is important in some way.

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
Like, whether it's intentional or haphazard is, like, that's been a topic of discussion at the top of the show many times.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, I guess it's the first thing that I, uh, see.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah, no, I'm sure that's why.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
It's not a scripted show. I don't have a plan to talk about anything. I mean, I have a couple notes.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
I passed a very important romantic threshold on my trip to New Orleans to celebrate Cody's mom's 70th birthday.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
We went to this city. New Orleans is great.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
So you like music and food? Who doesn't? I don't understand that part of it. I'm not yelling at them.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
They've been through enough, but I just don't understand. Who doesn't like music and food?

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
And what if I go to your city that's famous for its food?

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
So you got your Portland, you know, let's say your Asheville, North Carolina, we've been to, Austin, New Orleans.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
The big food cities.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
The food cities where it's like, oh, well, all the food's good.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
And it is. We always go there.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
If you go to these cities and open a bad restaurant, is it just that it's the momentum of the capitalistic biosphere there?

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Like, just people wouldn't go. They go, this food's terrible. I'm a Portlandier. I know the difference.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
I'm not going to. And then you would. So like, these are just cities that have created an ecosystem of foodie-ism?

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
So you're mad at New Orleans for liking food and for liking music?

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm just wondering if it's all a scam. You know, you just say your city is the home of good food.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And then people would just go, mmm, this is delicious.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Like, I'm kind of suspicious of it because I ate a lot of things called, like, Creole omelettes and they really tasted like omelettes.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
You're not supposed to get a Creole omelette. You're supposed to get a bag of crawdads or some, like, you know, a beignet and shit.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
And what is this obsession with the Saints marching in? Like, that's a really horrible song.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
It's about the apocalypse. It's like, it's an apocalyptic, biblical song.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Right.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
It's zealotry.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
It's about picking the right team.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Anyways, that's not what I wanted to talk about.

03:03.000 --> 03:16.000
I was in a hotel room and we were going to go out to breakfast and I didn't at any time, and I certainly noticed, I never, as we were leaving the hotel room,

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
I never asked, I never made sure that both Cody and I had a key.

03:21.000 --> 03:33.000
And I always did that. I was married and I always, I've never stayed in a hotel room with somebody and didn't make sure that we both had keys when we left the room.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Right.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
So, symbolically, this means that something has, I've let go of something in the back of my head as I leave a hotel room with Cody.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Like, I imagine we'll be coming back together.

03:43.000 --> 03:51.000
Aww. Or that's assuming we're coming back together, no matter what.

03:51.000 --> 04:02.000
Well, I mean, you could look at it as clingy, but I think it's more unhealthy than I was always, like, prepared for the event of coming home separately.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Right.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
Like, well into my marriage, I was still like, well, you know, stitch in time.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
It's a weird thing to be prepared for, you know, like, oh, well, you never know.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Now you feel healthy because you, likeâ€¦

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah, it never even occurred to me. Like, there's like the third time we went out, I was like, oh, shit, I haven't had a hotel key this whole time.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
I'm like, totally comfortable being completely dependent on this woman.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
See, it sounds pretty co-dependent.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah. I mean, I think it's a good, I think it's a good move in the right direction for me.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Yesterday was a good day. You all know what this is.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Did you have to use your AK?

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Yes. No, no, I didn't. It was a good day.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
That was a good day.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
But, you know, well, I picked up my gun.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Yay.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Did you use your AK or did you not use your AK?

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
I learned to field strip my Glock 19 in my bed and oil it.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
So you finally got your gun? Yeah.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Danny got his gun? Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
And it's amazing, like, guns are amazing.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
It's one of the greatest ways to shoot bullets.

05:22.000 --> 05:35.000
That's the thing, so that's the thing that was great, because part of the safety manual or the owner's manual, period, is that first of all, let me explain how a gun works and what's happening when you pull the trigger so that you don't blow yourself up or someone else that you're not meaning to,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
because it's a lethal weapon that you bought to put holes in people.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
But let's make sure you don't put in the wrong person.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
And so they explained how everything works.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
And it kind of really sinks home, because the ammunition, you buy by the bucket.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Like, I said, oh, I guess I need some bullets for this.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
And the lady said, how many buckets of ammunition do you have?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah. And I was like, buckets.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
And she's like, yeah, behind you, there's the target range bullets, and then there's the home defense bullets.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Those are more expensive. Why?

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Because the target range bullets will just go through walls and stuff.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
So even though they're kind of more dangerous, they're cheaper.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
The more expensive bullets are the ones that are just for shooting someone in your bedroom.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
But the ones that just explode inside of human bodies.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
That's what I was thinking.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I was like, do they lob out and land on the burglar?

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
But no, it probably is that they're just made of different stuff and they're not going through.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
The gun range bullets are more deadly than the non?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
And cheaper.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
I bought a paint bucket full of bullets.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
And that's just an interesting sideline in this world of mass shootings and stuff.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
When they go and they look in the trunk of the person and they say, look how much ammunition they had.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
But you buy this stuff in bulk.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
And the odd thing to me is that these guns, they're basically staplers that have a little,

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
you put a little rocket in them and it's got a bunch of explosives in it.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Like a stapler.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Well the gun part is like a stapler.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
Up until the point where instead of a stapler there's a fucking tiny rocket.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
So that's my point.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Chris Rock has that joke about we don't need gun control, we need bullet control.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
That would be the solution to make bullets really expensive.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
But I'm not making that same joke.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
But I am saying like, isn't it fucking weird that we don't regulate bullet?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Like you could walk into that store.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
I don't need a license.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Just buy these things.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Like ostensibly I can go home and make a gun.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
People make guns in prisons out of like bunk bed legs.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Like I saw Hill Street Blues once there was a guy.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
He was like, I got a, he was like a zip gun or something.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
He's holding like a little toothbrush thing he made.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
As long as it hits the firing pin receiver thing on the back, the primer cap.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And you can talk the talk.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
I was just like, that's the thing that kills you.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
There's a bucket of little rockets in my bedroom.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
And it was like eight bucks for a thousand of them or something.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
And it's like, those things kill babies.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
This gun is just like, you take it apart.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Like John Wick, you learn how to do that to clean it.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
And it's like, and that's when you realize all those movies, you know,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
like you see the movies where the guy like grabs the gun and field strips it with one hand,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
like the slider fly, you can't, come on.

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
If I did that, if I was a thug and I was like patrolling a drug layer

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
and a guy in a trench coat that was like the hero came around the corner

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
and he grabbed the gun, I'd be like, oh fuck, God, you're good.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
And then, but then if he like stripped it, like took it apart really fast,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I'd be like, okay, who, what are you, a magician?

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
Like, what are you spending your time on learning how to do that?

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Then you, maybe I should try to grab the gun back because I, like, that's all.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
That's like if you grabbed your gun and then like did a card trick or something.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
Like, the best time to take a gun away from somebody is when it's taken apart.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
It's the safest time.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Well, you could be easier.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah, anyways, I'm just saying, it's hard to.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Also, I like that you think that bullets are rockets.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
They are, they have a little combustible thing.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
They have a little cartridge that there's good gunpowder.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I mean, it's like, that's the part that kills you.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
What size gun do you have?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
What's the ammunition you have?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
It's a 9mm, right?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And I'm sorry, I know I stimulated the market.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I'm part of the problem.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
We've had gun violence just this last week and here I am like stimulating that market.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
It's like, for instance, if I was going to have someone up to talk about this amazing movie

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
that has a very pro-vegetarian kind of vibe and I've been eating fucking sausage like crazy after.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Like, yeah, we're part of the problem when we vote with our dollars.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I bought a gun, but that, I have no excuse.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I'm just scared.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
I'm like, I'm doomsday crepping.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
We got ham radio instruction manuals.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Man, yeah, I'm learning how to read, do ham radios.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
This shit's hard, man.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
There's a ham radio store.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
It was so much easier for you to just get the gun.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
It was so easy to get the gun.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
And then we went to the ham radio store and the guy's like, all right, what's going on here?

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Tell me what you want and I'll tell you how you can get out a month from now.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
And it was like crazy.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Like we bought for $30.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, his position was like trying to, it was like a secret club where he was trying to not tip his hand

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
but gauge where we were on the totem pole of ham radio.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Right.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Because there is a totem pole of ham radio and there is like three or four tears.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
But you can be mentally ill and buy a gun.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Oh, yeah.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah, and they're lifting those regulations like crazy.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Those people have lost their minds.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
You don't even need to pass background checks half the time

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
because like background checks can get expedited and if they go, I mean, this is certain states,

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
but if a certain time period lapse, they'll just go, oh, it's been too long.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Let's not do a background check anymore.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
And then so people just get guns without background checks.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
It's great.

11:07.000 --> 11:15.000
So yesterday was a good day because I was like, I'm just on this crazy roller coaster where I swear it's,

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
I have to be totally honest and just say if President Trump is upset, I'm happy.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
And if he's happy, I'm just depressed.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I can't do anything.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
So if he's tweeting like, hey, I don't know.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
If he's just like spiking his little toddler football, like I'll just have a bad day all day.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
But then two days ago, it was like this great morning because he had that tweet

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
about how he was under investigation and he's like throwing his fire truck around the room.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
And it just felt good and all of the articles were about like it's closing in on him

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
and he's under investigation.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I can't believe you admitted it.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
What a dummy and all this stuff and just all the, you know, I refreshed on all the threads

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
of how we're going to prove that he colluded with the Russians.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
This isn't conspiracy theory.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
This is a real thing.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
And now we're going to get his financials and blah, blah, blah and all this stuff.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
It just felt really good.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
And then this morning it was like, his lawyer says he's not under investigation.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I was just like, what the fuck?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
That's why I got the gun.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
I got the gun because the only thing I understand is that I'm out of control.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
And I don't know if you know how hard it is to be white and male and fragile.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
And you've said before that if you had to kill yourself, you'd do it with a gun, right?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah, I did say.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
I don't know.

12:33.000 --> 12:41.000
People don't realize how much the real heroes of Handmaid's Tale are the commanders.

12:41.000 --> 12:48.000
I have a question about Handmaid's Tale.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
Is it part of the point of that dystopia that even the men are miserable?

12:54.000 --> 13:04.000
Because isn't it a dystopic thing where the patriarchy is out of control and the women are just objects of fertility and servants and things.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
And they don't have rights anymore.

13:06.000 --> 13:16.000
But there's no men lighting cigars with women's hair and going like, I love having balls.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
They're all bummed out because they have to fuck their babysitter when they're looking at their wife.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
And everyone's sad.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
And I'm like, what kind of patriarchy is this?

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
Shouldn't it look at least like a little bit like 60s playboy club?

13:33.000 --> 13:42.000
Like they're luring little tales and the conception sessions are like private and involve music.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
I wish we could just find a dystopia where we could have fun.

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
But that makes me wonder, is that part of the commentary that it's not just about if men had their way, it would be awful.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
It's more about look what we do to ourselves.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
The patriarchy is the patriarchy because it's not self-aware enough to understand what it wants and doesn't want.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
We'll all land ourselves if we continue to follow this path.

14:08.000 --> 14:17.000
If we use the excuses of religion and gender identity to construct a society where everyone gets to do what they want, nobody's going to get to do what they want.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Everyone's going to be all bummed out and under pressure.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
And it would be better if we just relaxed, even if we were a little infertile.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I agree.

14:35.000 --> 14:43.000
My other question is, in the book, after she plays Scrabble with him, does it have like the 80s needle drop?

14:43.000 --> 14:51.000
Well, she walks in slow-mo like in Mean Girls. I felt like it was mixed messaging, but I'm not a guy, but I'm enjoying the show.

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
I am a guy, and I am a guy, and I'm enjoying the show.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
Dan, it's okay to not be a guy.

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
But we are kind of behind. We haven't watched Handmaid's Tale for a while, so maybe we didn't enjoy it.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Maybe we got turned off by the Mean Girls' slow-mo walks. Maybe we bailed on it.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
Maybe we were like, what is this? What's going on? Let's watch Wizard of Lies. Why is it called Wizard of Lies?

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
Is this supposed to sound like Wizard of Lies? What are they going for?

15:22.000 --> 15:30.000
Why is this a nonlinear story if the whole thing takes place in an apartment?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
How's your book coming along?

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
I'm working very hard on it. It's almost done. It's almost done.

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
Just shut up. They're going to sue the fuck out of me.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
I'm working hard on it. I had to go back and rewrite part of the introduction where I was like,

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
I'm introducing a book. Okay, hold on. The election's on. What the fuck?

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
There's no such thing as a book that you've started before the fucking election.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
A lot of creatives are going through this.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
There's also positive effects of the election where I'm finding as I work with writers

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
different stuff where we're breaking stories about a snowman that comes alive

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
or a robot that fucks a shoe. Whatever it is, even though it has nothing to do with politics,

16:15.000 --> 16:22.000
there's been a 10% decrease in the need for suspension of disbelief. Does that make sense?

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
It's just across the board. All writers, I'm not kidding. It sounds like a joke,

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
but it's like an every single project that I started before the election

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
and now I'm working on after the election where I'm having trouble with stories and stuff.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
We just go like, wait, so can't he just be a time traveler? And then they go,

16:37.000 --> 16:44.000
yeah, why did we rule that out? Oh, because, yeah, that was before the singularity started glitching out.

16:44.000 --> 16:51.000
And like, wait, why don't we just have her say, snowman, snowman, come alive, man.

16:51.000 --> 16:58.000
And she could just walk up the walls like Lionel Richie and...

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
She'd put the ceiling fan in her head and fly out the skylight like Inspector Gadget.

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
Why didn't we think of that before? I don't know. What was blocking us before?

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
Anything can happen. I got a gun. Yeah, I'm going to fucking kill myself with it.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Don't do that.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Eventually.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Don't.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
You want me to die of a stomach ulcer?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
Oh, man, I hope you die of a stomach ulcer.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
Can they kill you? A stomach ulcer? Can you die of an ulcer?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I know. Well, you get stomach...

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
An unintended stomach ulcer could create stomach cancer, I guess.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Do you have ulcers?

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I assume I have ul... No, I don't feel anything in my tum-tum.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
I have horrible heartburn. Chronic, horrible heartburn.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
It's got to be just 40 years of just soaking my esophageal flap in vodka.

17:53.000 --> 18:01.000
I can tell because if I eat popcorn, I now have to consciously breathe then eat the popcorn

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
and not breathe while I'm eating the popcorn.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
If I'm watching a movie where a Voorhees or something comes around the corner and I go,

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
the popcorn's going straight into every alveoli balloon.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
I just have lungs full of popcorn that are just disintegrating.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
There's like dormant tuberculosis in there like eating the popcorn.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
I didn't know what did I do right.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
So you got to be careful.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
You seem a little down. You said yesterday was a good day or today was a good day.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Yeah, today's a bad day because it's just like, I'm not under investigation.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
You can't control this guy.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
He's just a big... There's a baby.

18:46.000 --> 18:58.000
There's a baby on a motorcycle like driving in a bullet store with these swinging firing pins around in a bag.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Just throwing them everywhere.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
I mean, a baby in a motorcycle in a bullet store is not going to set the bullets off.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
I know. And maybe that's why the bullets aren't dangerous because nothing can.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
It just seems to me like if you look at the mechanism of a gun, the firing pin goes...

19:13.000 --> 19:19.000
It's just like a thing. It just seems like you could fire a bullet by hitting it real hard with a hairpin.

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
Yeah, yeah. Like if you had pliers and a small hammer, you could go bang.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
Shoot so much.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
You never hear about those shootings.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Have you shot your gun yet? Have you taken it to the range?

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
No, no. I want to learn to use it.

19:39.000 --> 19:47.000
There's a firing range nearby here and they have a weekend gun safety class, but I don't know, man.

19:47.000 --> 19:56.000
The last place I want to be is like a group of weekend intro gun safety class humans.

19:56.000 --> 20:02.000
Also, people keep going into gun ranges and killing themselves because you get a gun and it's free.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
When it's free, it's cheap. People just keep blowing their heads off.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
Gun ranges. That's just part of the territory. That's just a price of admission.

20:11.000 --> 20:17.000
Sometimes you get like a chicken and your egg McMuffin.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
That probably doesn't happen.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Alright, anyways.

20:26.000 --> 20:34.000
We're bringing up our friend now, our new friend that I met at Netflix screening for this movie that's coming out, Okja.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
God damn it, it's Bong John Ho, June Ho.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Bong June Ho? Did I get that name right?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Bong is the first name.

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
There's like a thing where the people that refer to working with him on set is like a part of Korean culture.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
You call him Director Bong.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
That is like kind of fun. I don't know.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
That is fun.

20:58.000 --> 21:05.000
I wish we had that. If you're a director or you should be called writer Harmon or writer Dan.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
Yeah, I don't know. I'd like it.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
And then all the fertile women, we can round them up dressed like nuns.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
Put in a sizzling red color.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
Sizzling.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Red nuns is hot.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
They're the handmaids. They're like red nuns.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
But only when they go to buy oranges? Like they also have to buy oranges for everybody?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Okay, alright.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
I'll work up my dystopia. It's got third act problems.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
But anyways, this is a friend of Cody's who was there.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
That's why we were at the screening.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Because I was at the screening, I didn't know anything about the movie.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I never saw a trailer.

21:48.000 --> 21:56.000
So my mind was blown by this movie, so I was like, come talk about it even though you guys haven't had a chance to see it yet.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
It's coming to Netflix next week.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
But let's welcome our new friend, Christina Oh.

22:00.000 --> 22:18.000
Oh, thank you. Christina brought a foam oakja.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
She fell.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
A foam what? What is it?

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
It's a super pig.

22:24.000 --> 22:35.000
Oh, it's a super pig. Oakja in the movie is a super pig created by a corporation to genetically modified in order to solve world hunger.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
These aren't spoilers, right? It's the first five minutes of the movie they explained it all.

22:39.000 --> 22:54.000
And so there's giant pigs that are being tested and the story follows the ownership of one giant pig, Oakja, and her owner.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
What's her name?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Mija.

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
Anyways, I saw you after the movie and I was like, I think that was a perfect movie.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I think it was a 10% Gillin Hall reduction.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
People are going to say he's over the top.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
But I didn't care.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
But I don't know why I qualified it with that, but it's because truly I wanted to.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I really thought it was a perfect movie.

23:16.000 --> 23:23.000
And then you were shocked to hear that and it seemed like so was Bong. Can I call him Bong?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
You have to call him Director Bong.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Director Bong?

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
Right. So the last name comes first is the formality, right?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah, it's a very honorific culture.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
You got to eat that mic.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I'm sorry.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Oh, because my mic's hot.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
No, it's just picking you up for a really far away.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Yeah, your mic's not as hot because we're in an honorific culture too.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
So the male gets the better mic.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
There's a glass ceiling on your mic decibels.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Okay, I will put it in.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
I got to check through mine too.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
See, I'm like right here.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
But don't cover it with your hand. Yeah, there you go.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Okay.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
Unless you're going to beat box, then I find that helps because it helps the peas not pop.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
That looks cool too.

24:03.000 --> 24:11.000
Oh, John.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
So this movie was co-written by Director Bong and...

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
John Ronson?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
No, tell us about him.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
John?

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah. Was he there at the screening?

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
He was not. He was not.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
He's cool though.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
He's an author, well, he's a well reviewed author and he has worked...

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
He's known Bong forever, Director Bong forever.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.680
And then he came up with this site or director Bond came up with a site crazy idea

24:33.680 --> 24:37.640
I think driving down a countryside and he saw this billboard

24:38.400 --> 24:43.680
Or he saw this animal and was just like, oh, you know, what's it doing out in the middle of nowhere and

24:44.360 --> 24:48.640
What was that animal? He mentioned that but he didn't mention the species of animal. I don't know

24:49.920 --> 24:52.840
Cute animal thing in Korea. Yeah

24:53.920 --> 24:56.280
The the so the movie

24:56.280 --> 25:03.120
Uh, it's not gonna be theatrically released. Well, we're gonna so Netflix will do a day-in-date

25:04.360 --> 25:08.480
June 28th, and it will play in I pick theaters in LA for like a week or so

25:08.480 --> 25:12.280
but no, we want you to go watch it on Netflix and

25:14.400 --> 25:20.920
He talked about that a little bit and he was answering questions through a translator, but he speaks fine enough English

25:20.920 --> 25:25.720
To do conversative stuff, but he what I what I was gleaning was that

25:26.120 --> 25:31.200
He every every director probably wants their movie to be on every theater screen in the world on Friday night

25:31.200 --> 25:37.160
And everyone go out and eat popcorn and watch it like we're gonna so it'll be a while before people get used to that not being the case

25:37.160 --> 25:38.280
but

25:38.280 --> 25:43.920
It was worth it any the lack of that to work with Netflix. This is an unpaid plug

25:44.800 --> 25:46.800
because they're really like

25:46.800 --> 25:50.680
They're there they they I don't want to make them sound irresponsible

25:50.680 --> 25:56.160
But they give you money and they kind of what let you do your thing. Well, that's kind of the reason why okay?

25:56.160 --> 25:59.760
So once you see this film you'll realize like holy shit

25:59.760 --> 26:03.720
Who would have given these people like this amount of money to go make this movie?

26:03.720 --> 26:06.680
It's a craze. It was a crazy thing like imagine going to pitch me like alright

26:07.280 --> 26:08.240
so

26:08.240 --> 26:13.680
There's this girl and her best friends this genetically modified pig and gets taken from her and

26:13.680 --> 26:15.240
And

26:15.240 --> 26:17.240
She's a she's a visual effect

26:18.960 --> 26:24.000
Give us like several million dollars to make this but also it's rated R and it's

26:25.280 --> 26:31.880
That's the big thing it's like yeah, it's a big giant CG pig that you fall in love with the first moment you see it

26:31.880 --> 26:38.400
It's a horrible rated R movie. I mean, I can't even imagine any other studio being like yes

26:38.400 --> 26:45.000
Director bong here's a check, but that's why I really think it's a masterpiece and I also like something like what I was watching

26:45.000 --> 26:47.120
I was like oh, so this is a snowpiercer guy. I

26:48.120 --> 26:51.160
Started watching snowpiercer and then I was like there's tonal

26:52.360 --> 26:56.680
Incompatibilities with me here. I it's hard enough to write a comedy or an action movie

26:56.680 --> 27:00.600
I don't want this goofiness happening in my action movies and I kind of like drifted away from it

27:00.600 --> 27:03.920
I was like I bet that's just the thing when East meets West, you know like filmically and

27:03.920 --> 27:08.800
Then I when I watched this movie. I was like wait no is this guy like the Coen brothers or

27:09.240 --> 27:16.360
Anybody else that we put in that category where he's like fucking with us. He deliberately you can he's evolving now

27:16.360 --> 27:23.920
Or maybe this movie just like makes it clearer that he really deliberately plays with tone in order to take you from laughter to

27:24.600 --> 27:26.600
Horrible like facing the abyss

27:27.360 --> 27:30.120
He's master at that if you've watched any of his other films

27:30.120 --> 27:35.120
He did this film called mother and earlier did memories of murder and then he did this Korean film called The Host

27:36.800 --> 27:38.120
Which

27:38.120 --> 27:43.160
The first time I saw I was like what is this and it's like this horror movie wrapped up in comedic bits and

27:43.840 --> 27:48.440
One scene that I feel like wraps for me that wrapped him up was in that particular movie

27:48.440 --> 27:53.540
He there's a scene where the father figure is explaining to his kids why

27:54.360 --> 27:59.280
The third particular youngest son is like kind of seemingly messed up and doesn't have his life together

27:59.280 --> 28:00.600
And he's like, you know

28:00.600 --> 28:05.280
We were so poor when we went when he was little and I couldn't feed him proper protein

28:05.280 --> 28:07.920
So that's why your brother's like a little slower than you guys

28:07.920 --> 28:14.260
And he's like really bearing his soul and then the camera pans to the other brother and sister and they're sleeping

28:14.480 --> 28:19.160
Like it's just like those tonal shifts where he's like trying to open up and be emotional about something

28:19.160 --> 28:24.840
But the world is like not hearing it and it kind of reminds me of Alma DeVar

28:24.840 --> 28:31.280
You know in that sense that there's like you're living and I don't know how much of that is the effect of watching a foreign film

28:31.280 --> 28:36.160
That blends a little comedy with like thought-provoking weird shaky shit

28:37.520 --> 28:43.280
That's what I'm trying to figure out as a Western viewer is how much of this is one person's genius

28:43.280 --> 28:48.440
And how much of it is just the weird effect of like a movie

28:48.440 --> 28:55.320
Translating across international and if you know anything about director Bong he is like

28:55.320 --> 29:03.760
I think growing up in Korea which had a very military kind of like regime for a long time when he was growing up like he

29:03.760 --> 29:09.200
I don't know if he wants me to say this, but he was like arrested for protesting in the 90s and stuff like that

29:09.200 --> 29:13.480
like he is intrinsically I think a person who has something to say about

29:13.480 --> 29:18.320
The way the system works and kind of fighting against him. This is kind of his way of doing it

29:18.320 --> 29:22.640
I don't want to put words in his mouth, but that's kind of how I read it this film

29:22.640 --> 29:26.960
I think the underlying message of course, it's about friendship and

29:27.560 --> 29:30.920
You know this little girl and her bringing her family back and like this

29:31.800 --> 29:37.680
Having to come to terms with adults and like grow up really quickly in the span of like a week or however long this film takes place

29:37.680 --> 29:40.280
But it also has this kind of like

29:40.280 --> 29:43.960
Not to like the greed and

29:45.040 --> 29:52.000
Horrible nature of capitalism and right, but you're never preached to that's what I'm trying to figure out how to tell people

29:52.000 --> 29:55.040
Because the truth is if I look if I read the description of this on paper

29:55.040 --> 29:57.360
I wouldn't know I don't think I would I'd be like well

29:57.360 --> 30:02.640
When am I gonna be in the mood to to to be told that every time I eat bacon and something horrible is happening?

30:03.680 --> 30:05.680
I'll put I'll put that on my list

30:05.680 --> 30:11.080
You know and but because I just wandered into this movie inside

30:11.080 --> 30:15.080
I just like I'm so into I want to tell people you don't have to worry about that it

30:15.680 --> 30:17.680
It is heart-wrenching

30:18.280 --> 30:26.760
But only in the same way that kind of ET is and it's I guess it's sort of like what if ET was delicious is

30:28.240 --> 30:34.080
Is the it would just make ET kind of extra you'd be rooting for Elliot to fly a little more

30:34.080 --> 30:38.880
Spoilers Elliot flies. It's an ET's kind of a piece of shit. This movie is really good

30:39.560 --> 30:43.920
Now I mean there's there's definitely a lot of like there's it you can sense the there's it

30:44.280 --> 30:50.280
There's like a half dozen movies that you could feel a real genuine like influence from without being derivative

30:50.280 --> 30:53.000
Like you feel this whole ET thing, but you also feel this

30:54.840 --> 30:58.280
King Kong like Pete's dragon if you yeah, I

30:58.280 --> 31:05.400
Would say that a big props though goes to our visual effects supervisor Eric de Boer

31:05.400 --> 31:08.400
I'm just putting it out there, but he helped create this

31:08.920 --> 31:16.000
Magnificent creature like I've never I've never worked on a film where we've had this amount of CG where I mean World Wars

31:16.000 --> 31:17.280
He was a different thing

31:17.280 --> 31:23.320
But this was like the main character the star of the film is a visual effect

31:23.320 --> 31:29.280
Yeah, so how do you create that bond between this little girl and this made-up creature?

31:30.160 --> 31:37.080
And make it believable and touching and I've seen the movie probably like 20 times now and every single time at the end

31:37.080 --> 31:39.080
I'm like crying and

31:39.240 --> 31:45.000
I was kind of remarkable in terms of like I found myself crying because the movie was so good sometimes

31:45.000 --> 31:49.960
I was like like not because it was sad narratively there there were those times then too we're like you know

31:49.960 --> 31:54.120
I could hear Cody sniffling and I was like if I look at her that she'll see that I'm crying but

31:55.840 --> 32:03.360
But I don't want to oversell it but you know hey everybody go everybody watch this and tell me I'm insane like if I like

32:03.360 --> 32:09.720
Like if it's not actually like this big a deal of this movie, but like I I found myself near tears

32:10.080 --> 32:11.680
Because of the action

32:11.680 --> 32:16.000
Sometimes because I was like yes, this is this is how you do it

32:16.000 --> 32:22.680
It's like it's a little it's a little girl and she's like trying to save her pig, but like it's not

32:23.680 --> 32:27.240
Cloyingly like oh, she's a little girl, but she's a power puff girl

32:27.240 --> 32:31.760
She's got big strong powers and you love like she's a little girl

32:31.760 --> 32:40.000
And she's really at odds with the physical world and but she just is flinging herself literally and figuratively at this giant machine

32:40.840 --> 32:42.840
called humanity and and

32:42.840 --> 32:48.240
Like like what I was most impressed by it was like there's these action scenes where

32:49.200 --> 32:55.440
If she's chasing it, you know you can see her making decisions about physically what she should try to do next and

32:56.000 --> 32:58.800
You're so you feel like you're playing like an 80s laser

32:58.800 --> 33:04.320
Just video game or something because you actually are with her and that she's like you know am I gonna try to jump on this

33:04.320 --> 33:08.640
Track yeah, I think I should but I didn't it's typically in action movies

33:08.640 --> 33:14.120
There's a little bit of suspension of like oh, well how did you know that you were gonna you just you're just

33:14.560 --> 33:17.960
Improvising and so you decided to jump and now you're gonna land on that truck

33:17.960 --> 33:23.120
But it's like there's a slight difference between that and why am I I do this all the time by the way it's called dance-planing I

33:25.080 --> 33:29.400
I'm a terrible interviewer. I just bring people up and I just talk I coined that yeah

33:30.280 --> 33:36.960
But but but do you know from working with him is that a conscious thing when he's doing action that he wants people to track the choices?

33:36.960 --> 33:38.960
Okay, well

33:39.120 --> 33:44.600
Another thing about director bong is he's like a director who've never worked with him before this guy's like remarkably

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
meticulous in the way he shoots

33:47.280 --> 33:53.360
So every sequence or every whatever the entire script is basically storyboarded

33:53.600 --> 33:57.640
So I land in Korea and you're basically handed this book of the entire movie

33:57.640 --> 34:00.520
That's storyboard and shot for shot like it's it was insane

34:00.520 --> 34:06.200
And then the night before we get our call sheets and with them are the boards for the next day with exactly

34:06.200 --> 34:08.200
What's gonna happen? So

34:08.200 --> 34:13.320
It was it was kind of crazy because you already knew and you already knew what it would look like and then you just you know

34:13.320 --> 34:19.840
You direct a scene and it was exactly like those boards what what was drawn and a lot of people were like

34:19.840 --> 34:22.080
Oh, you know that does that give you creative freedom or whatever?

34:22.080 --> 34:25.320
But it does I think if you hear some of the actors talk about it

34:25.320 --> 34:27.960
They're like we knew exactly what we needed to do

34:27.960 --> 34:33.680
so then we could kind of have freedom within those parameters and then the little girl

34:33.680 --> 34:40.300
Mija who's played by An Tso Hyun was just remarkable. She was this she's like this incredible kid and

34:42.080 --> 34:45.120
Did everything so beautifully and then like would just go and do it

34:45.120 --> 34:49.640
She'd like be playing in the corner and then they'd be like action and then she'd go run run down the street

34:49.640 --> 34:52.000
Yeah, and then he'd be like cut and then she'd be like

34:52.800 --> 34:54.800
Where's the snack truck?

34:56.080 --> 35:00.960
I think people are gonna freak out most about her because people are freaking out about the you know the little girl in Logan

35:00.960 --> 35:05.760
Who's like so amazing and so striking and she's she's doing so much with so little like dialogue and stuff

35:05.760 --> 35:08.080
She's just like glaring at Hugh Jackman and like holding her own

35:08.640 --> 35:15.320
But like this little girl is like doing these scenes with Paul Dano who is I've never I was never like hey

35:15.320 --> 35:18.000
He signed me up for the Paul Dano fan club. No one or was I a hater?

35:18.000 --> 35:21.560
I just I would see him and I go who's that guy his face is kind of weird the

35:22.880 --> 35:28.320
The but he is fucking amazing. I wanted to marry him like I saw his character

35:28.320 --> 35:32.040
That's the other and then the other thing again. I'm doing it again. I'm not asking you anything

35:32.040 --> 35:37.040
But but like oh keep going like that character is deeply flawed, but he's so righteous

35:37.160 --> 35:40.440
And it's just it's in his relationship with the girl and I

35:41.880 --> 35:43.200
I

35:43.200 --> 35:46.480
Loved the internationality of the story

35:46.480 --> 35:49.960
I love that it's part of the story that some people speak

35:50.440 --> 35:54.640
Korean and English some people only speak Korean some people only speak English

35:54.640 --> 35:58.480
That was kind of another aspect of the film that we wanted to touch upon

35:58.480 --> 36:05.000
I think director Bong likes to have these characters that are conflicting like there's this animal liberation front and

36:05.440 --> 36:08.120
They're a group with well-intentioned meanings

36:08.840 --> 36:15.880
You know wanting to save this pig and expose this evil corporation and how they like had created all these thick

36:15.960 --> 36:19.440
Like super pigs that are just fucked up and they're having a terrible time

36:19.440 --> 36:25.560
But there's there's there's a group of terrorists in the movie and they're the good guys

36:27.000 --> 36:29.400
There really is an ALF like that's not an actual

36:30.760 --> 36:39.040
Actual I think it's it's not like a direct it just happened to be like I think it came from his cousin is like an activist or something

36:39.920 --> 36:41.920
but anyway, so

36:41.920 --> 36:49.040
They're they themselves are very conflicting characters, especially Steven Young's character who is Korean-American and he speaks

36:49.520 --> 36:52.000
Korean in the film, but he's like terrible at translating

36:53.120 --> 36:57.040
His character is I mean in real life. I'm just kidding

36:57.480 --> 37:02.080
He's Korean's really good. His Korean's really good. So like they have these conflicting characters where

37:02.760 --> 37:08.360
You know, they have well-intended. Well, you know, they really mean well, but they're kind of like a group of just like

37:08.360 --> 37:12.400
Bumbling idiots at times. Yeah, I mean they're pure of heart

37:12.400 --> 37:17.320
It's it's hard to say it's like they're it's that archetype where the people show up and they're kind of like they're goofy

37:17.320 --> 37:23.240
But they're heroes in Jake's character. Mm-hmm is like a deeply deeply. I don't know if I don't know if you got that

37:23.240 --> 37:25.240
But he's like a deeply flawed

37:25.520 --> 37:30.640
Person who started out as like this, you know, Steve Irwin asked kind of like

37:31.200 --> 37:35.480
Animal lover and then it has just been beaten down by this woman for the past like

37:35.480 --> 37:42.000
Tilda's character for the past like ten years. He's like the shell of a man who he was and he's just kind of taking it out on

37:42.120 --> 37:47.240
Yeah, let's let's talk about Gyllenhaal for a second bit in this movie who I

37:47.960 --> 37:52.360
Just because I I want to protect him because I feel like he's making choices in this movie

37:52.360 --> 37:58.120
They're so fucking over the top that everyone that I'm afraid maybe I'm wrong about this, but I'm afraid people are gonna go

37:58.120 --> 38:00.120
Why is he acting like the Riddler?

38:00.920 --> 38:02.920
When other people aren't doing that

38:02.920 --> 38:08.040
It but like what what what kind of conversations does director Bong have with?

38:08.560 --> 38:12.920
Actors do they show up to set and go like I thought I'd try something like this and he's like whatever

38:13.920 --> 38:15.920
Or or is he like

38:15.920 --> 38:21.640
Like how hands-on is he so Jake came in like I think we were halfway through our shoot in Korea or so and

38:22.920 --> 38:27.000
We were literally on this mountain side at her house

38:27.760 --> 38:31.960
when he comes up the Mountain is like that was like the first day and

38:31.960 --> 38:37.800
This it's this beautiful set. It's in the middle of nowhere. You have to like hike down for like 10 minutes

38:38.720 --> 38:40.720
it's super secluded and

38:42.440 --> 38:44.440
Director Bong was just like yeah, so

38:44.840 --> 38:48.000
You know he's coming up the thing and maybe he's just really out of breath. So he's like

38:49.640 --> 38:56.400
And you know so he kind of ran with it and then that happened and it kind of just stuck and we you know

38:56.400 --> 39:02.200
Of course like us being on the other end. We you know, we see those dailies and we're just like um

39:02.720 --> 39:04.720
Does anybody want to say anything?

39:05.760 --> 39:08.320
And what does so what does Bong say?

39:09.160 --> 39:12.280
Like hey, so and you say no, I kind of like it. So then we're like all right

39:12.440 --> 39:17.360
Do you and we had like this weird trust that it would work out and it did but I'm crazy

39:17.360 --> 39:19.840
He stuck with being out of breath as a character choice

39:19.840 --> 39:26.280
So when you see the film, I think he is very high-pitched

39:27.240 --> 39:33.760
Did you see snow piercer? Did you I hate it's not there's there's there's it's a bad movie

39:33.760 --> 39:35.760
Meet me after the show. I'll explain it to you

39:36.960 --> 39:38.960
There's like everybody's like

39:40.720 --> 39:47.000
Till the Swinton what she's doing in this movie along with John Carlo Esposito who was on community

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I that's not important, but

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
But it was kind of also kind of exciting

39:52.800 --> 39:56.520
The just the two of them and along with what

39:57.360 --> 39:59.360
director Bong does with

39:59.640 --> 40:05.840
Foley like in scenes that have no score where they're talking and like till the Swinton is

40:06.680 --> 40:09.360
Like like doing just the character is like

40:10.480 --> 40:16.920
Sir a totally car a total cartoon and absolutely like rich somehow like like captivating

40:16.920 --> 40:23.480
Maybe that's just oh you you're pulling out the Ferrari of actors and you're just like like so just cruising around the block feels like

40:23.600 --> 40:30.200
An Olympic sport or maybe it there's like but it feels like this incredibly amazing character this performance

40:30.200 --> 40:35.320
And then the John Carlo being like her like attendee and then he like he'll be goes and makes a cup of coffee

40:35.320 --> 40:39.440
And you're just like the the choice of the camera to be everywhere

40:39.440 --> 40:42.680
It is at every moment where you watch John Carlo Esposito

40:42.680 --> 40:49.840
Make a cup of coffee for a second before doing his next line of dialogue and everything is just fully step step step

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Click pour steams

40:53.320 --> 40:55.320
You're thinking you're bringing her to New York

40:55.560 --> 40:59.960
And then that's my favorite. That's one of my favorite part. She goes. I was just about to say that

40:59.960 --> 41:05.200
And I think it's in that scene because like then Gillen Hall is also in that CD comes into it and goes like hey

41:05.200 --> 41:07.200
there's what I think and and

41:07.600 --> 41:11.440
And I'm kind of like oh man, I don't want anybody to be punished for enthusiasm

41:11.440 --> 41:17.440
No, I think for the way that I like reconciled that in my head was that hit heat his character

41:18.640 --> 41:23.680
Basically, he like ten years ago was this normal guy and then for ten years

41:23.680 --> 41:25.680
He's been playing the role of this

41:25.840 --> 41:31.000
Spokesperson and having to do all this stuff and he's become a puppet for this corporation that he's almost

41:31.560 --> 41:34.760
Become the role that he was just playing and he does say that stuff

41:34.760 --> 41:38.800
Yeah, and then you know and then she even says like quit your whining, right?

41:38.800 --> 41:44.160
I if I if I was in the edit bay, no one needs my help on this movie. It's a masterpiece

41:44.320 --> 41:47.880
But I did say I was like well put your money where your mouth is Harmon

41:47.880 --> 41:51.640
If I was in the edit bay and I had all that footage and I had one pickup shot

41:51.640 --> 41:57.600
I would just have one shot where we were just where Gillen Hall's character does a little anal nitrate

41:58.920 --> 42:00.920
Like he just does one popper

42:00.920 --> 42:07.880
Um, like like like like or there's something weird some weird thing like like like huffs something or well, you know

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
That would have been helpful like three months ago

42:11.680 --> 42:14.360
But it's not yeah, I mean it's yeah, so

42:14.960 --> 42:17.920
But so the movie like this is the thing like I

42:18.560 --> 42:25.320
It's okay to say he's not a vegetarian, right? No, he he helped write he conceived of this movie and

42:25.920 --> 42:28.120
Then shot the entire thing

42:28.120 --> 42:35.960
I everyone that watches this movie for at least 48 hours is is not you know, you're gonna just not have

42:36.440 --> 42:44.880
Sausage. Yeah, I remember being in a in a meeting earlier on after we were doing some scouting and we were watching some research footage of

42:45.720 --> 42:49.280
There's a there's a scene where they're I don't want to like give it away

42:49.280 --> 42:54.000
But they're dealing with animals in a certain way and so it's based that that scene

42:54.000 --> 42:58.400
Is based off of a real how they actually

42:59.600 --> 43:05.240
Treat cattle. Well, of course. Yeah, we figure. Yeah, and and I was sitting in this meeting and he was like, oh

43:05.240 --> 43:09.680
I want to show you this research clip and we were like I was like, oh god

43:09.680 --> 43:13.400
And I was sitting there trying to hide that I was crying

43:14.120 --> 43:16.120
like in a room

43:16.800 --> 43:18.500
Producers and other

43:18.500 --> 43:20.160
Actual like actual footage of yeah

43:20.160 --> 43:24.520
I was actual footage of cattle being led to their slaughter essentially and they like

43:25.040 --> 43:28.080
Recoiling kind of knowing like they were headed into something dangerous

43:28.720 --> 43:33.760
And it was like the worst thing I'd ever seen and I was like I don't want to eat anything after I had a couple friends

43:33.760 --> 43:39.520
And I can't say their names because they might still be like the ALF animal liberation front was on FBI's

43:39.520 --> 43:41.520
Like most wanted list and it might still be

43:42.240 --> 43:44.240
and they would go into

43:44.240 --> 43:49.760
a meat processing plants and animal testing labs and take the footage and

43:51.000 --> 43:54.080
And I would tell people like I'm vegetarian

43:54.080 --> 43:55.680
I don't preach it people should eat what they want to eat

43:55.680 --> 43:59.240
But there's a couple things if you don't want to eat meat don't watch this tape

43:59.240 --> 44:06.640
Yeah, and there's footage that's so absolutely compelling and so horrifying and that's the thing that I want to make clear only because

44:07.080 --> 44:09.940
creatively this movie deserves so much

44:09.940 --> 44:17.660
Recognition for what it's somehow pulling off and I have no idea how it's doing it. How is it that part of the movie?

44:18.460 --> 44:23.940
Everything that I've said, you know, you're you're imagining like oh, I understand the idea is like like Lisa Simpson

44:23.940 --> 44:27.900
She sees the movie and it's like gross and it's like you don't want to eat meat anymore

44:27.900 --> 44:29.660
But it's like it's not

44:29.660 --> 44:31.660
somehow it doesn't

44:31.660 --> 44:34.660
gross you out it doesn't make you

44:34.660 --> 44:43.420
It doesn't spank you as a meat eater for 40 years, but it just somehow invites you up

44:43.420 --> 44:45.820
I think that's the point and we didn't want to

44:46.860 --> 44:51.260
for us at least our intention is to never be like

44:51.940 --> 44:55.020
Preachy about anything. We just want to show you a different

44:55.980 --> 45:01.180
View of something and be like kind of like hey, this is how it is make your own decisions

45:01.180 --> 45:08.140
But we would like to to show you a different side of the truth that maybe you don't you aren't familiar with and that's kind of

45:08.140 --> 45:10.940
That's a really extraordinary mind at work on his part

45:10.940 --> 45:17.980
It's like it would he be a better person if he didn't eat meat sure so would I but since he does enjoy bacon at breakfast

45:18.220 --> 45:20.220
him making that decision

45:20.560 --> 45:23.060
artistically what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

45:24.740 --> 45:29.420
Put my camera on this side of this of that story that issue that that

45:29.420 --> 45:31.900
Probably and and I'm gonna do that faithfully

45:31.900 --> 45:37.940
He just wanted to do that creatively and it no and then he just finished the movie and he ordered some sausage and

45:39.340 --> 45:42.460
That to me it may it may not make any of us good people

45:42.460 --> 45:43.960
But it certainly makes him a genius

45:43.960 --> 45:50.180
Yeah, you know actually I think when he went on his research trips to he actually like visited some slaughterhouses

45:50.180 --> 45:55.140
I think he couldn't think the whole crew that went on that trip couldn't touch meat for a while because it was like

45:55.260 --> 45:57.260
there's something about

45:57.260 --> 45:59.260
the smell and

45:59.300 --> 46:05.900
There's also different levels of we're talking about like you know there you I imagine there's people that have different levels of issue with different

46:05.900 --> 46:08.620
It's like there's probably people in the audience that

46:09.580 --> 46:15.140
personally eat meat, but also recognize that there's perhaps like an industrial problem where we

46:16.140 --> 46:21.100
We we were doing it wrong the system is built wrong. We're over addicted to me

46:21.100 --> 46:25.180
We we we should make it more expensive and it should be always

46:25.180 --> 46:27.180
a

46:27.220 --> 46:29.780
Processed in a in a in a way that a more

46:30.580 --> 46:35.460
Shooting with a bow and arrow and praying over its carcass in the forest. Yes. That's exactly what

46:38.220 --> 46:42.260
But what about you by the way, I never asked you like are you a vegetarian? I

46:43.620 --> 46:44.900
Have

46:44.900 --> 46:50.700
Made a kind of decision to try and do the pescatarian thing for a while because after actually after having work on this

46:50.700 --> 46:52.620
I need pork for the entire thing

46:52.620 --> 46:58.380
It's just there's something about piggies and what about crustaceans. I actually don't like

46:59.460 --> 47:03.340
Chelfish or Christy that that's not yeah, I'm off of them since New Orleans

47:04.420 --> 47:10.620
Just ate too much. This is brought a brown bowl of it looked like HR Giger like made of

47:12.020 --> 47:17.700
It was just like everything is just like the eyes of the face and it had an expression on its face

47:17.700 --> 47:23.100
And I wasn't a human and it wasn't I wasn't like oh this poor this poor this poor jumbo shrimp like

47:23.500 --> 47:27.580
That's the exact face. They make right before they died. It just freezes. It's what they know

47:27.580 --> 47:31.980
They're like you're gonna I'm gonna be served to the guy that's not even gonna appreciate me. I'm a hearty

47:33.100 --> 47:37.660
But what a terrible death. Oh you killed me and the guy didn't fucking dig it

47:37.660 --> 47:42.180
Yeah, yeah, but but it was never like because they put a bib on you and

47:43.260 --> 47:46.500
But it's like I look over at Cody and she's like yeah

47:46.500 --> 47:53.580
You can't you know, but I don't know but I'm like what did you do I looked it out of the bowl just and I just it's curled up

47:54.420 --> 47:57.940
And then you uncur as you uncurl it the legs go

47:58.620 --> 48:03.060
like that and then juice goes everywhere and then

48:03.540 --> 48:07.140
You just like well, do I eat the face off and then squeeze?

48:07.140 --> 48:13.500
I think you're supposed to like my mouth like rip the head off and then suck the head suck the head she says sorry

48:13.500 --> 48:20.500
Yeah, I think but at the end of the day, I just peeled it like a hard-boiled egg down to a big jumbo shrimp

48:20.500 --> 48:22.820
And then ate it was like yeah, it's fucking shrimp, bro

48:23.940 --> 48:25.940
Don't make it shaped like an insect

48:25.940 --> 48:29.940
But you but you we're talking about you don't like when you get meat on the bone

48:29.940 --> 48:32.660
You don't like to have to do the work. Yeah, you want it to be done for you

48:32.660 --> 48:39.260
And I would definitely if we were living in a proper kind of caveman tribe you die

48:39.260 --> 48:41.260
I would know I would be a vegetarian

48:41.260 --> 48:45.300
I would I would be like, okay, I'll you know, I wrote a play for you guys

48:45.300 --> 48:52.340
Can I have a piece of brisket and and if the alpha was like no you got a you got to kill what you eat

48:52.340 --> 48:54.820
What you kill a big then I'll have a salad they like

48:55.700 --> 49:01.820
I don't like your attitude like and good good luck with your the obvious analogy for your care

49:01.820 --> 49:07.540
You're your character in my play. What do you think would be what do you think would be in your kick in your caveman salad?

49:07.540 --> 49:10.900
What would that consist of arugula and parmesan?

49:13.340 --> 49:16.820
Just because I like that at little Dom's that's one thing about the caveman

49:16.820 --> 49:19.860
I don't really appreciate is how good they were at making aged cheese

49:23.620 --> 49:27.660
But Christina like so, how did you get that you your producer you work for plan B?

49:27.660 --> 49:34.780
I how long you've been there a little over six years. I'm an executive producer executive producer a step

49:34.780 --> 49:40.500
Well, no, it's a step. Yeah, settle down. I fell for the same thing. I'm an executive producer on a novel. He said it's like

49:41.260 --> 49:44.980
You know, I didn't do anything but you did lots of stuff on this movie

49:45.820 --> 49:50.500
When the words are handed out, you're not gonna be up on the stage for that. No, I'm okay with that

49:51.380 --> 49:54.860
But what stage did you get involved in the film? I like how early?

49:56.020 --> 49:57.580
so I

49:57.580 --> 49:59.580
got involved in

49:59.580 --> 50:07.780
The towards the end of 2015. I think October or November of 2015. I was like shipped away on a scout location scout

50:08.540 --> 50:14.460
For like days. I forgot the connection was plan B, which is Brad Pitt's company, which is hilarious

50:14.460 --> 50:16.900
He's the CEO of isn't he like

50:17.900 --> 50:26.380
Yeah, is he is he always eating when he comes into meetings or is that only for as an acting choice like it's like, you know

50:26.380 --> 50:34.340
No, he likes to eat because he started like as soon as it appears as soon as he got a say in what he gets to do on camera

50:34.340 --> 50:36.660
He was he obviously started saying it's an actor

50:36.660 --> 50:40.020
Could I be eating something watch watch any Brad Pitt movie with the sound off?

50:40.020 --> 50:43.940
He moves his head a lot and he points a lot a lot of pointing a lot of

50:43.940 --> 50:45.940
I

50:52.700 --> 50:56.580
George Clooney has like a weird like George Clooney's head always like I got a swivel

50:56.580 --> 51:01.220
It's like he's bobbing. I like it's funny to watch like actors without the sound on

51:05.900 --> 51:12.580
Give us some dirt and Brad Pitt talk to talk to Brad Pitt shit. I really he's a lovely human being. It's just the best

51:12.580 --> 51:18.180
What is it? How often I mean, well, they're just like what is he like in person?

51:18.180 --> 51:21.100
I'm just honestly just asking like I'm a high schooler. I

51:21.940 --> 51:26.100
Don't I mean, it's I feel like I'm just gonna whatever he's literally just like he's normal

51:26.100 --> 51:28.180
He's comes in and he doesn't go

51:32.860 --> 51:35.860
But it's cool, I mean he's got his company is doing cool shit like I

51:36.540 --> 51:40.940
World where Z, you know, what what I I understand why it wasn't

51:40.940 --> 51:48.540
Well, it didn't break records and whatever but I it was a great idea to try to make that book into a movie

51:49.420 --> 51:51.420
political zombie yeah, I

51:52.340 --> 51:57.940
Like I like I like his usage of what he's been dealt like like he you know, he's Brad Pitt and like he's

51:58.460 --> 52:01.780
Like lots and lots of actors are like, okay, then I'll have a production company

52:01.780 --> 52:05.420
And but he's like clearly some some somewhere in that pipeline

52:05.420 --> 52:10.460
There's somebody going and it might be CEO Brad Pitt going like I want to make good choices

52:10.460 --> 52:13.100
Yes, of course, he's he's great, but

52:14.100 --> 52:16.820
DD Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner my colleagues are like

52:17.540 --> 52:24.740
Really just crushing it. I remember DD Gardner worked at Paramount, right? Yeah a long time ago before plan B

52:25.820 --> 52:27.660
Is it okay?

52:27.660 --> 52:30.340
Brad Pitt we got we got we got that's great

52:32.180 --> 52:36.940
12 monkeys, what is Brad Pitt does Brad Pitt that was my that's where I'm getting my fresh

52:36.940 --> 52:38.940
Oh

52:39.660 --> 52:41.180
Like I wear two outfits

52:41.180 --> 52:45.420
I wear either a suit or I wear like a v-next like sweater and jeans like does he have an outfit?

52:47.580 --> 52:52.620
Rapid have a uniform that he wears or does he wear a different shirt every day like give me some quotidian bread

52:53.060 --> 52:55.060
You know, I'm I'm like

52:56.020 --> 52:58.020
The most unfun person to ask

52:58.020 --> 53:04.580
You so you don't want to be part of our regular weekly segment the pit stop

53:06.700 --> 53:08.700
But we just check it

53:08.700 --> 53:26.140
Well, we'll find five seconds, but talk about oh god

53:28.380 --> 53:30.380
He doesn't have a uniform

53:30.900 --> 53:34.180
It's the update. It's a whole different thing. Where were you born and raised?

53:35.380 --> 53:37.380
mass juices and

53:37.380 --> 53:41.260
And so you moved you moved out to LA first or no, you know, okay

53:41.260 --> 53:46.740
So if you a brief I was born and raised in Massachusetts until I was 13 and they moved to Arizona

53:49.340 --> 53:51.900
Four people cheered for Massachusetts one night boo

53:53.100 --> 53:58.220
I bet that guy's from Arizona, right? Like are you from Arizona? You're from Boston

54:00.220 --> 54:02.220
Massachusetts, okay

54:02.220 --> 54:04.020
Where in Massachusetts?

54:04.020 --> 54:13.420
Boston, okay, I grew up in Peabody Super Super tiny is that is that a town that's spelled differently than its name would suggest I

54:15.620 --> 54:18.700
Suppose it's spelled P E E

54:19.340 --> 54:21.340
B U D D Y

54:21.380 --> 54:23.220
Yes, Peabody

54:23.220 --> 54:25.220
That's the one Peabody

54:26.980 --> 54:28.980
Got a lot of Massachusetts

54:28.980 --> 54:33.980
Yeah, and then I moved to LA Spencer. Will you be my Peabody later on? Yeah, is

54:35.540 --> 54:37.900
Production your ambition or are you

54:38.940 --> 54:46.420
Transitioning like is this is helping out in a production capacity like is it the end all be all or is it a means to know?

54:46.420 --> 54:48.420
Of course like I would be a producer

54:49.340 --> 54:53.180
Without the executive in front of it, but that's why it's not you know

54:53.180 --> 54:58.660
It's not and then I'll be a director or then I'll leave that to people that are far more talented than I'm glad you said that

54:58.660 --> 55:02.580
Because we have directors and writers appear all the time that we go like what's your advice?

55:02.580 --> 55:05.380
But it's like we have so few like Steve Levy my assistant

55:05.380 --> 55:09.620
He he wants to be a producer and like ten years ago. I'd be like no way

55:09.620 --> 55:12.460
That's not an ambition. Fuck you suits are evil

55:12.700 --> 55:17.900
Whatever and I would have and then I would have gone on to get fired by everybody and no one likes me

55:17.900 --> 55:25.500
And I they're like why do you keep calling us suits? I think people I think people don't really know what a producer does right like producers are fucking important as

55:26.740 --> 55:28.020
AF

55:28.020 --> 55:30.020
To put it in your language

55:34.620 --> 55:40.260
They are as they're important a AF yeah, yeah, I well I switched over I switched it was like

55:40.820 --> 55:44.580
Gen X to millennial like it's like Spanglish. I was like as AF

55:45.300 --> 55:52.300
All right, but no, but it's like saying like like like pin number you can you can choose how much gender mustard

55:52.300 --> 55:54.300
You want to put on this you can either answer this

55:54.300 --> 56:00.820
For the young ladies in the audience as a woman the interest in a production or you can just answer it as a human being

56:01.820 --> 56:04.220
That also you can do both at the same time

56:04.220 --> 56:20.780
You you guys are gonna go home tonight and realize that meant nothing. I

56:21.980 --> 56:23.980
Am not a villain

56:24.620 --> 56:26.620
And that was not a hero

56:27.660 --> 56:29.660
You'll figure it out later

56:29.660 --> 56:34.820
Whatever I forgive you for you know not what you do

56:36.260 --> 56:38.260
But yeah, I mean if it's

56:38.620 --> 56:42.860
Like like people out there that are going I want to work in production like what are they?

56:43.140 --> 56:46.980
How and what are the obstacles any pieces of advice whatever take it?

56:49.660 --> 56:51.660
Why thank you

56:53.500 --> 56:55.500
There is no like

56:55.500 --> 57:01.100
Do this and then do this and then do this and then you're a producer if anyone ever tells you that they're lying to you

57:01.620 --> 57:03.620
I did an internship

57:04.500 --> 57:06.500
worked my ass off and

57:06.820 --> 57:11.300
Very serendipitously landed at this company people hear that maybe some people are going okay

57:11.300 --> 57:16.460
So what how do you what do you open the yellow pages you Google yellow pages? Yeah, you find out what yellow pages mean?

57:17.460 --> 57:23.180
Like like what you like really get granular about like what do you do from Massachusetts?

57:23.180 --> 57:28.100
Like what the first step where you go like I'm gonna like start you have to have kind of

57:29.420 --> 57:31.420
slightly

57:31.940 --> 57:36.380
Impressive Asian parents that want you to be a doctor or a teacher

57:36.380 --> 57:42.300
Mm-hmm, and then but you secretly have to want to do something a little bit. I mean I oh happy father's day dad

57:42.300 --> 57:44.300
I love you

57:44.660 --> 57:48.660
Actually my dad wanted to be a film director, but then gave everything up and

57:48.660 --> 57:52.740
Don't you have to call him father dad in your car? Yes, father? Oh

57:53.860 --> 58:00.220
The father wanted to be a film director, and he actually went to film school in Korea in I don't know

58:01.300 --> 58:06.020
70s, and then he immigrated to America to give us a better opportunity

58:06.380 --> 58:09.100
So to speak but then how do you get to be an intern on it?

58:09.100 --> 58:15.340
Yeah, so then so then I like moved to Arizona went to school and Scott stupor was an alumni at that stupor

58:15.340 --> 58:17.340
I know he doesn't do anything

58:17.340 --> 58:24.220
He's like he just he's at Netflix now. He sounds like an Archie comic character. That's great

58:24.220 --> 58:27.340
He's he's he's super lovely, and I interned at his company out of

58:28.260 --> 58:32.700
College in my last semester. Is there a bulletin board?

58:33.940 --> 58:39.300
University of Phoenix is there what what was the University of Arizona? Okay? Yeah

58:39.300 --> 58:44.460
Yeah, no, he was an alum there

58:44.460 --> 58:50.660
So he had this like premiere internship program that you had to apply for and and then I got it and I

58:50.820 --> 58:54.580
Went and you work for free for four months, and then

58:55.580 --> 58:57.860
It opens doors for you, I suppose

58:58.420 --> 59:04.140
But if anybody okay if anybody actually is interested or wants to know I guess come find me afterwards because I

59:04.140 --> 59:10.100
Don't do that to yourself, okay, but but but no, but I feel like it'll be like because sometimes people are like

59:10.100 --> 59:13.580
What do I do? What do I do? Can I be an intern on on your show?

59:13.580 --> 59:17.900
Can I be a PA and all the stuff and I'm like I don't I'm not I never did that

59:17.900 --> 59:22.460
Yeah, and so I would say interning interning is a great thing be a PA

59:22.460 --> 59:29.420
but it's just like kind of like my thing is be nice to everyone and introduce yourself and like be a cool person and

59:29.820 --> 59:33.260
Things will happen if you're an asshole like I immediately I'm like

59:33.260 --> 59:39.380
I don't want to talk to this how do you sustain yourself like when you were like people like that have internships like you you're

59:39.380 --> 59:42.900
You're not being paid for your work like were you broke back then or did you have a yeah?

59:42.900 --> 59:51.140
I lived I my parents helped me of course. Thank you, but I like lived with this old Korean couple

59:51.140 --> 59:57.580
They were super nice. I like had a I stayed in a bedroom at their place that they like kind of randomly knew my parents

59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.740
and I just stayed in a lot and I didn't

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:06.300
Eat a lot of rice and kimchi. You're so racist right now

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:14.780
But that's the thing like like you hear about like like a lot of people that get to become like you know like you turn on the news

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:18.940
And everyone's a journalist that they're all rich people they because they could afford to be yeah

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:23.900
I think if they could afford to spend three years unpaid labor as as interns and doing the stuff

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.140
But you like you actually just like

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:32.620
Lived you squatted with an old couple and didn't eat much except you know like basic food. Well, I did I did I mean like I

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:36.280
Did eat because otherwise I'd be a lot skinnier, but

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:43.420
No, I do think like I I knew when I needed help and I was like listen like I want to do this like how do I

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:50.640
Do this in my school was really cool and helpful and I did I did thankfully find this couple which was kind of odd like

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:57.760
It was in a weird bedroom in Koreatown and there was a fridge in my room. I didn't really understand like a full-size fridge

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.760
Did you ever look inside of it? It was empty?

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.760
Yeah, I lived in Koreatown when I first moved to LA

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:10.920
There was a murderer in the alley behind my house, and I'll tell you that bad

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.280
But yeah, we should talk later. It doesn't sound like

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:19.760
I mean, I guess I guess it helped that I am Korean so it was it made a little bit of sense

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.320
I don't I'm sure the guy that got murdered was Korean. I don't know

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.680
I'm just assuming

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:30.320
But but but you know it is it is it is difficult and I think like the difference now

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:37.880
I think is a lot of internships actually do pay you. Oh, yeah. Yeah, what's next for producer? Oh, what's next for plan B?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.840
If they're the same thing you can answer as a woman or a Korean

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.840
I

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.080
Actually, I actually became a

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:55.560
Actually through this whole experience. I I became friends with Steven young this

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.560
He's an awesome awesome dude

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:03.880
And so I think we are gonna try and cook something up and then we're working on a film

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.680
James Gray's next film right now. We just wrapped a film called beautiful boy

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.400
directed by Felix von Groningen, which is gonna be a

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.520
It's kind of it's gonna be like a little sad, but

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.480
Well, it's 9-11 everybody. Let's hear it for Christina. Oh

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.040
But not those things aren't related

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.960
Thank you, Christina. Oh, we're talking about

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:37.680
Oh, yeah, what's it Winston on June 28 next Wednesday

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.320
So right now you're saying Dean is a there's been a shift in the show you're wearing a foam

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:53.280
Super pig on your head. It seems like a harbinger of some sort of new aspect to our to our program

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.120
And also you dismissed your guest like some kind of weird handmade

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.160
patriarch

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.760
You sent her off. Why would that be?

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:07.000
Well, because as promised like this is finally it after much fucking to do

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.760
We're we're gonna we're gonna play our new Pathfinder campaign

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:22.160
Thank you, I think you might have jumped a gun on the music I just wanted to give it a sting

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.160
Oh, okay, cuz I think well

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:30.040
Let's let's let's let's see if this experiment can work or we we take a break for the for the mid-roll ad that the people

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.360
That pay five dollars a month don't have to listen to and instead

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:39.640
The people listening to the ad on the free version of the podcast don't get to hear the following. I

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.120
You know, we don't actually have to do anything cuz no one will know I

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:57.640
Think they'll know and they'll get on reddit and they're not gonna say nothing. These guys are too cool to be on reddit

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:08.160
Let's just talk shit about reddit during the night. Yeah, they hate reddit is like the Arizona of Sites

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:23.440
It's a great Arizona is a great state to go to if you hate women Mexicans and gay people and front lawns

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.720
But you love gravel

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:33.280
Their front lawns are gravel look you hear your statements bear no fucking gravitas right now. You got a phone

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:38.400
I know what to I know what to do during art. This is still during art. This is still our special break

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.560
Let me show because this will just be for people that are

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Captain we're going warp factor seven

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.280
The actor his eyes

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:02.400
Do you guys think LeVar Burton like did you even listen to that episode it did something happen during that show that would explain

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:08.420
LeVar Burton not only not showing up to my wedding, but also just kind of generally. I don't know. I feel like I

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.080
Think he's on ear wolf now. Maybe it's an ear wolf beef

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:23.120
Okay, can I think he is can you pull up the I got my iPhone plugged into the feed

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:31.160
And because I just wanted to show these you might have seen these I retweeted this picture. These are those meat torture videos. These are the

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:37.320
This is the this is the photo of the there are the protesters that were outside Shakespeare in the park

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.920
This guy's got a little sign that says boo the cast and

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:48.800
This guy and don't be don't don't be fooled into thinking this is a crowd. These are just two pictures. We're just

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:54.480
This this guy is behind this lady in the first so

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.880
It's just Spielberg here with his pro-trump far left. It's America

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.840
So the weird thing is I retweeted that and then somebody like that had tweeted it

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:10.240
They're like hey respect my investigative journalism because what I found out is that this person was saying this

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.680
I followed this like kind of sub thread and they were like

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:21.000
This guy was outside the fucking Hamilton show in New York. It's the same guy

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.760
with the same sign

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:30.880
Same font same as a do you do you think that he

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:36.400
Like Cody Cody said oh man if his son breaks his arm he can stand up at the hospital again triple

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:43.880
But I don't know why you wouldn't want to cheer that cast or because it's an Obamacare cast

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.760
Or if he becomes a ghost

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:55.640
But this guy said now it's like a question of is he so he definitely went from a boring villain to an interesting villain

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.960
But kid if he goes to it. Well, what could he do with the sign to make him the world shittiest hero?

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:07.000
But what's his angle? He hates the cast because they're being lefties or what well

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.360
You know the Shakespeare in the park thing, you know, they did Julius Caesar and they they it's like look you when you do Julius Caesar

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:16.680
You you you pick a fucking wardrobe you pick an angle they go

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:22.920
Oh, let's make them 1920s gangsters other thing and they did an Obama thing where they Julius Caesar was an African-American man and they

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:28.920
They they and this this time they they give him a big long red tie and like blonde hair

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:34.400
And so then it was like we all know that these people aren't

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:41.320
Actually offended and don't they're just playing this fucking a weird game of hungry hungry hippos with us like where it's like

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.920
They just like they're just like I don't know that was a game from 1849

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:50.140
It's just so fucking weird, but I don't want to get sidetracked by that because we were we all spend our days

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.920
Where was this taken? This is also in New York

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:58.160
This is no well wait. Where's Shakespeare in the park? Where's that's Central Park?

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.680
Yeah, so but here this guy has that much free time when he just goes from theater to theater

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.040
I like the idea that he made the sign for Hamilton and then he brought it home

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.920
And he's a hoarder and he just put it on the side of the he didn't he's like he's like I don't know

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:17.760
I'm gonna hang on to that because the the arts typically, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't the last time that a play

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:24.160
He gets intertwined with my politics and then he went to sleep and he ate some spam and he

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.520
But if he likes the play he has another sign that says don't boo the cast boo the player

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.240
All right, we're back from the secret segment

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:43.840
If you're working at Feral audio, you shouldn't have left any of that in the show. No one's working there, okay?

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.800
And he's leaving and she can't even walk

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.120
It's bad when Annie walks out. It's like, yeah

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.840
Please stay we just got into our ablest jokes

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.160
She's just going to the bar

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:07.480
There's 45 people online. That is where you will always find Annie. All right, so Spencer. Hey guys

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:13.480
Are you rock-and-roll some D&D right now some pathfinder rather? I gotta say though. I think it'll be bad

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.120
So I'll just put that out there

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:21.360
What why are you dwell my my student? Yeah, it's a great way to make it good

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.760
Why are you so pessimistic? Are you just lowering expectations? No, well, I mean

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.200
Technically, yeah, I am lowering your back. I'll give you an excuse

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:37.320
Levy's not here and we just last show we agreed. Oh, it's gonna. We're you know, we're gonna make it consistent

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:39.320
It's gonna be the three characters now. Levy is

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:46.840
You know, yeah, right this is his family for Father's Day like he does every year because his dad died

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.960
What a fucking asshole

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:56.080
Me me me more like Steve me me yeah

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.720
Steve me me

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.720
More like Steve Levyus

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.680
He did

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.640
Yeah

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:12.080
But that could be your excuse because you could that caught you off guard now you you gotta confine the adventure to the two of us

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.200
I'm just I'm excited about it. I'm barely drunk like I'm like not as drunk

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:23.280
Yeah, me too, and and I just we're gonna do real like I know my spells. I

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.920
Yeah, it'll be bad

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:32.760
It's fine. I know my character. Yeah, like I know who I am kind of

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.840
You said earlier you might change your name from Carlos. Oh, yeah

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.120
I thought about it for a second because I was like, oh Carlos people are gonna. Oh, that's like a freaks and geeks reference

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:49.040
Like wasn't that James Franco's character? Was it Carlos the dwarf? Yeah, but then I thought well, he's Carlos the unimaginative. So I

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.160
Don't know I say leave it

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:56.160
I say leave it because if it's all of a sudden I'm named Duracell the fuckbucket, you know, like

01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:05.920
Wait Duracell the fuck like Duracell the fuckbucket. Oh fuckbucket. I heard fuck like I want like if you don't become Duracell

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.800
The fuckbucket. I hope we meet that character somewhere along the road

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.640
Just made me happy

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:22.560
I also feel like if once you once you once you riff the name Carlos if you change it to anything else

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.960
I do feel like the Latino community

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.480
Feels we're gonna have a very valid complaint because I'm like famous for the lack of fucking Latino presence in my

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Yeah, and remember that that

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:40.520
What's gonna have to soccer joke remember the Latino community joke? Oh, man

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.200
You are not coming back after that. You are way behind with that population

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.720
population

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:52.600
We can't take another risk by changing a name away from Carlos, so you'll be just out of the

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.200
game

01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:00.640
All right, well, I'll stay no, there's that the thing it is like there is a press conference at community college

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:07.160
And then there's like a mister. It's a studiante press. What how will this affect soccer? Oh, oh that yeah

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.720
Well, you think people were so there are there's protests. All right

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.160
Okay, all right, so Spencer, how do you how do you want to kick this off? It was a great joke

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:26.080
Great do you you let me know when you want theme music you can you can cast us off into a mystical realm of madness and mayhem

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:34.120
All right, we're gonna do real combat turn-based no more. I build a boat and row it to the weapons store

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:40.680
You can say that but he's like oh you say okay. You start building a boat Spencer

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:44.120
You're gonna keep us honest on our on our if we do things that are not

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:51.680
Proper you're gonna you're gonna give us notes, right? Yeah time as far as I feel like doing that, right?

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:58.560
Spencer your enthusiasm your enthusiasm is exhilarating. Yeah, I'm really just trying to set the table

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.280
Should we start yeah, yeah hit it

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.400
All right

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.600
The town of Rowan has been in peril a letter from the local priory

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:20.160
Details of village under siege by evil the prior says heresy and evil have taken root in the town and demons and evil spirits have

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:27.520
Been inflicting the town's folk they've begged for aid in the past and they've lost contact with both of the clergyman

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:35.560
Who are sent to investigate the prior fears for the lives of his congregation and seeks the aid of the church militants in

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:40.160
Rooting out the source of the evil and saving the village from its sin

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:46.680
All right, yeah, I didn't get a lot of that because I couldn't I realized oh shit. There's gonna be notes

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.680
It's a classic trend of yours

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:54.120
It's good. So let's start by asking questions. Do you have any questions?

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.160
Questions may be generating from the fact that you didn't hear some of this

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.040
I got a I got a letter yes from my

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:13.280
Superior or some you know some bureaucrat within my church said go to this town right this town is

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:20.200
Languishing from evil right there's evil taking root in this town and it's affecting our towns folk

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.840
What's the town's name row and or Roan roan? I think that's just Roan right sure

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.360
I mean I invented the I mean, that's a word. Yeah, let's move past I

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.520
Wrote her down to W. So let's just call it Rowan. I mean whatever I

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.800
Actually, yeah, no, I don't think you writing it down wrong should change the name. Yeah, you can't do that

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:48.360
You were you were waffling on your own decision pull the pronunciation to be sure

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:53.600
Yes, that doesn't open you up. This is what I'm talking about. Dungeon Dungeon topping from the bottom of the dungeon

01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:01.760
No, it's great. Everyone's great. Alright, so you guys you're in like a horse-drawn wagon together

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.840
Because you've been you're you've been dispatched on this mission. Um, yeah

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.480
Hey, Carlos

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.720
Chad

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.360
Good to see you back

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:19.600
You were you're away for a while. It's nice to be back on a case with you. Yeah

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.160
I'm really proud of you

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.360
Really?

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.920
I remember I I taught you things

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.320
As my in my role as a cleric at the Church of the Silver Frank flame sure

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:45.120
And you were a great acolyte you were a great initiate. Yeah, you know, but I'm I'm I'm I think I'm pretty grown up now

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.800
I got it's I I feel weird that we're equals like we're basically the same kind of

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:55.040
Status like in the church like I think of you as kind of a hero. You're my mentor

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.040
But now we're working side-by-side as a team

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.440
Hi, don't don't I mean it's good to just say that stuff don't

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.520
Don't carry shame around with you

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.400
You know, just keep yourself pure

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:13.320
I admit to my jealousy like I teach young kids how to be

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:19.040
Adept at the arts of the silver flame and I you know when I see them

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.680
Rise and stature faster than I've ever been able to I

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:28.080
Get I get jealous now that I've got us that you kind of get in your own way a lot

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:34.120
Like, you know, you could have been top dog. You just you you you kind of self sabotage yourself a lot

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.840
Yeah, I mean and now you're being a dick and

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:44.320
But if I know and the key is which of us is more self

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
inspecting and which of us is saying

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.640
And the answer that person

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.080
Okay, let's look. Let's let's let's just drop it. Yeah, I clearly

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.760
Clearly it's a lot of baggage there. I know this church is fucked up

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.760
You know when it's fucked up church is the reason why we're here like what we're trying to purify ourselves and purify the world of evil

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.240
The religion is the reason we're here the church is fucked

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.760
From the head down by people that believe more in politics than religion. Okay. Well, let's not talk

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.760
Can we have one wagon ride where we're not doing this?

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:23.520
I'm just concerned for the people of Roan

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.360
It's pronounced Rowan, but that's cool

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.680
How far out do you think we are?

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.320
Driver

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.320
You're the driver

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.560
Hello, what? Oh

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.400
I'm driving. Yeah, it's just like a horse

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.440
Jesus

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.840
Carlos, are you drunk?

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.800
Voice in my head. I thought maybe was the silver flame said you're the driver and I

01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:01.400
Thought it meant I if you've been drinking you just you're supposed to put the reins to the wagon in the bowl by the door

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:06.960
And like somebody else drives the wagon. It's okay. It looks like Rowan's I

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.040
Look ahead on the road. What do I see?

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:16.360
All right, the road is rough and bumpy out in the countryside and the rolling hills look endless and foreboding in the dreary

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.040
Gray of the darkening clouded sky

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:26.120
Following an even smaller winding road to your left takes you off off the main path and into the

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:33.200
And into the gentler yellow planes that give way to fenced plots of fallowed farmlands

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.400
That's like farmlands without crops in them the edge of town

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:44.840
This must be the edge of town aside from a single small house and barn near one of these farm plots and to darkened

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:51.640
Ruined kind of burnt-looking structures. No real buildings or civilization are found this far out

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.040
It seems like way down the way

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.400
There's there's a bit more of a town

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:02.440
But you really only see in these kind of three buildings on this on this path and it's kind of getting towards evening

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.440
maybe we should stop here and

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:09.160
And let's look the horses rest and maybe give them some something to eat some water

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:15.280
Let's see if there's any people around that can give us information the kind we won't get once we're in the confines of the city

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.840
The three buildings are a barn a farmhouse. What else? Well, you see a farm in a barn house or

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.400
Barn in a farmhouse. There we go

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:28.680
That are right next to each other and then across like you're on a road

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.880
And then that's on to say the left side of the road and then on the right side of the road

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.320
You just see two kind of burnt-out husks of buildings. Whoa

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.120
Easy

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:47.080
We leave the wagon into the barn, okay, so

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.400
All right, yeah

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:56.240
No, you go you roll up towards the barn and you can see there's light coming from inside the farmhouse

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.760
And the barns closed for the night. Oh, it's nighttime already in sundown

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:03.920
Well, it's it's like getting dark, but the barns magic hour

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.360
Yeah, that if that's established and sure

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:13.000
It might be magic. I I kind of quietly walk up and

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:20.240
To a window at the farmhouse. Okay. Wait. Oh, sorry. So we just established. What do you guys look like? I?

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:25.920
Mean we can establish that later, but I don't know. I'm a gnome druid

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:32.120
Yeah, I'm a short little fellow. I carry a walking magical quarter staff

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:38.720
That has secret powers and my name is Chad the fire liker. I'm a gnome druid, right?

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.920
And I you know I'm dressed druidic

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:47.000
I've kind of brightly colored hair and a brightly colored outfit. I'm a little eccentric your colorful gnome man

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Yeah, sure

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I'm a human

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.200
I'm a human size medium. I

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.400
Am I'm wearing a

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.840
Dirty robe

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:06.400
Right, so that's like church clothes kind of but your clothes are probably not like church clothes

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.120
They're like colorful. Well, I mean I I

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.800
Accent my church garb with you know, like I got like it. Oh, okay

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.360
I got like my pouch that I carry my stuff and it's kind of like a fanny pack

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:23.880
Was it switch it's very brightly colored. I think I kind of look like an older Antonio Banderas great

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.240
This is perfect. Maybe with a little punch like I'm not athletic

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.680
But that might be part of I don't know what Antonio Banderas looks like these days

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.440
But I think I think I kind of look like a like a like a

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.360
More ragged Seth Green

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:45.840
Well, this will be perfect

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:52.920
Thank you, sorry for the diversion so we are parking our carriage

01:21:54.600 --> 01:22:00.440
This is one that we own did we rent this it's it's I mean, it's the church is maybe but yeah, okay

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.440
It's like a company car. It's a church wagon

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.280
It's a church wagon

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:10.360
So we park it. I don't know, you know what I'm assuming my character knows more than I do about how to park a horse-drawn

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.200
Cart you kind of just stop it really, okay

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.720
And how far is this?

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:25.320
Light from this farmhouse the farmhouse is like maybe there's a six like a five foot gap between the farm or the farmhouse of the barn

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.600
So it's really close. They're right next to each other

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:33.200
So that the glow is really close from the window and you said you're going to the window, right? Yes, okay

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:36.560
So you look in the window and you see you see a woman who's tending to

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.840
Tended to a cauldron over a fire, but it looks like a cooking cauldron not like a witch cauldron

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Hey, yeah, well, you're a goblin you shouldn't be hanging. I was like dude. I'm a gnome so fucking this

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.640
I'm going to the front door

01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:00.000
Goblin, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't I'm sorry. I

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.280
I actually misheard that I wouldn't say that my character wouldn't say that you know it

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:09.320
Because I actually just me if I if I if I didn't have I see you being a dumb one

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.560
So if I didn't have so much respect for you

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:17.000
I I would tell you that I see why the church doesn't keep you in their good graces while you're at the same level

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.400
Like you should be like like ten times higher ranking than you are. We're the same like I'm like the third your age

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:30.040
You can't you walk around calling people goblins. It's like I fucking fuck fuck you

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:38.400
So why don't we just finish this let's let's rid Rowan of evil and get to get the fuck out here

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:41.320
And then you you can go hang out with other racist people. I

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:50.320
Go to the front door, okay? I

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.640
Don't need you to be a perfect person I

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:02.400
Look at you as an opportunity to learn I

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:09.200
I channel the silver flame it purifies the earth of evil knock knock

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:24.560
Hear that coming from inside someone I only speak common. Yeah, so is that really what they're saying or yeah

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:33.280
It's like an old person. Ah, ah, ah

Sorry, he's just grumbling. He's grumbling. He's coming to you you hear a guy coming to the door and then from the other side

The door you say who's who's out there?

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:49.080
In inquisitors from the church of the silver flame, sir

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:56.720
You hear him lock and are not lock and unlock and multiple locks and he swings open the door

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.560
He's holding he's holding like a kitchen knife, but he's not like menacing

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.280
It's just kind of like he was holding a kitchen knife before this

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.720
Put put the knife down sir. Might if we come inside

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:17.280
Sure, yeah, well, who are you we're from the church of the silver flame we hear that your town's been ravaged by evil

Suspector

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.320
My name is Tom

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.320
the farmer

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.960
He puts down the knife

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.360
Thanks

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.360
He he kind of turns away from you and just motions you to follow him in

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:49.160
He's going more church. God damn it more church half this damn chant town is church. This whole place is fucking church

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:52.120
Ain't done any good. My name is Tom Tom

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.480
I walk in do that thing where I just kind of drag my finger around along

01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.760
It was like a surface and like check and see how dusty it is like it doesn't mean anything

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.760
But it looks like I know what I'm doing. Oh

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:07.480
Yeah, it looks like you know what you're doing the church folk that you're

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:11.320
Used to dealing with maybe from the ministry. We're militants

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.400
We get the job done or your lack of money back

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.320
Sir Tom, I'm sorry to come at you at this late hour

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:24.200
But did you or anyone you know come in contact with the evil that just went through the town he?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.520
He wait do a two cents motive check. It'll be great

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.640
Do you have a sense motive score and your skills?

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:35.480
I do

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.480
All right, you can do one too. Okay

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.000
And mine should be high because I have a wisdom of 16

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:47.320
I think both of you guys have reasonable wisdoms, but yeah, no, I don't have any like extra score on sense motive. All right

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.840
Well, what's your wisdom then and what's your sense motive?

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.440
My sense motive is checked but blank

01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:01.240
But my wisdom is 16 and my ability modifiers therefore plus three my wisdom is 16 plus three

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:08.760
What are the odds both of you have the same score? Okay, it's great. You he he he hears your question

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.680
What was the question?

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:14.200
Did you or anyone that you know come in contact with the evil that ravaged your town?

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:21.400
No, I don't I don't know what you're talking about man. There's the only evil here is just church corruption

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:26.280
Um, but dan you can tell he's he's he's hiding something

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.800
Okay, you have any family sir?

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:52.440
Yeah, let me describe it. It's just like a house. There's a staircase that goes up into presumably like maybe bedrooms or stuff

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:57.720
But the main area is just kind of a wonder room. It's like a family room dining room kitchen

01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.960

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:11.080
You feel a sense of dread creep through your entire vault body as you hear an unearthly voice bellowing

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.400
Get out of my home

I am a purifying vessel

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:49.000

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:15.400
Kid belted down to the bed and there's a strange light

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:23.000
There's a strange light kind of flashing around the room and you see darkness kind of emanating and leaking from the kid's eyes

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.520
And his mouth

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:27.080
Is like you have no power over me

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:30.200

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.280
Channel energy

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:52.680

Uh, you you see the wave wash over him and he goes

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:12.840
But he doesn't seem damaged or hurt in any way as if he's not a member of the undead and that's called

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.800
Elimination

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:19.640
I'm always one step ahead. He's not undead

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.640
I'd call this a case of possession

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:28.040
And that really gets my giblets

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.800

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:21.160
We thought you'd like do something

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.880
I pound pound. I I say out loud. I I the damn church

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:33.880
Oh, yeah, well, we'll show you the power of the church. I I dare I tell the ghost of the ghost inside cliff

01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:37.400
Come out and fight like a ghost and not be a shit

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:43.480
Well it's Dan's turn, but you do say that okay

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.400
I I I check for more dust

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:53.080
Wait, what I didn't hear that we're really out of our league here like we know

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.080
You

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.080
What

01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.800
That would be nice if they had that. Yeah

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:06.520
That would be nice if we abolished that

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:15.000
Uh, I I you know, I mean I want to it's hard to hit a kid like with a weapon

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:21.960
Because it's yeah, you really went in guns of blazing. I know we did we did we're bad. We're level two

01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:26.120
I I I just I just punched the kid in the face

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:34.760
It's a non-lethal attack like I'm not using a weapon. I'm just like I just want to make it clear

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:37.720
That

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:42.680
We don't care like like you can't use a human shield. We don't negotiate with ghosts

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.600
All right. All right. Well, um, so you you you

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.440
you

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:53.400
Raise your fist and stomp over to the little boy

01:41:53.880 --> 01:42:00.840
And um out out in front of the little boy a ghost kind of bursts out of his his body and kind of stands like

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:06.440
Like guarding the little boy, but you know, he's a ghost so you just walk through him and you deck the little

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:13.640
Oh, unless you want to stop does the ghost make you change your because it like yeah, yeah, okay

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:21.320
Sorry. Well, then what do you want to do in response to the ghost? Uh, because that would be funny though

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:26.920
Well, I mean if I if I see the ghost can I do more than stop? I mean I I I you know, I

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:34.120
Well, whatever happened a good old turning of the undead, you know, I'm a cleric like that's that's a feet. You'll get next level

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.960
He's a yeah, and I I a ghost is traditionally undead

01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:42.200
Oh, well, but but if when he's in the dude, he wasn't like

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.200
Uh, I mean

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.400
Um, I said you may be making assumptions that aren't based in reality

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
That's a catch all right

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:57.320
I can't answer that question without giving you a hint Carlos

01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:01.160
He just walked through a ghost before you hit that child. Well, he didn't hit the yeah

01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:04.280
You almost hit a child, but thank god that ghost came out

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:10.040
All right, well, I don't want to do too much metagaming, but I think it might be an illusion

01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:14.440
This is what it may be like like this isn't I don't think everything is what it seems

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.600
I I I'm gonna punch the kid anyway

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:30.280
So you step through the ghost and you deck the kid the ghost or the kid is still laughing like

01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:35.400
And you deck the kid and he and he he you hit him pretty hard

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.120
He um

01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:40.120
I'm not proud of it right

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:46.040
Well, you can be um, he takes four damage and you can see his face start to swell and he goes

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:54.040
And the ghost uh the ghost that came out starts like grabbing on you and you can feel its coldness

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.680
But it can't hurt you for whatever reason

01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.800
The ghost might be good

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:05.320
The ghost might be good I gotta yell something out at you

01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.320
Uh

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:10.040
I I go over and I I hit the kid too

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:15.800
The ghost the ghost is protecting the kid

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:22.600
The ghost is protecting the kid the kids possessed by a demon right the ghost is undead and is but

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:29.400
It is out in front of the kid and and not and the kid is like still has a demon in him or something

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:35.880
Right, so I I think it seemed like we're making progress by hitting this kid

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:45.640
You're always making some sort of progress. I wait I wait for my turn. Okay. Well, that will be after I I I pass

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:50.440
I I go to the kid I raise my fist like I'm gonna hit him

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:52.280
All right

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:56.280
So then the the ghost boy jumps off at dan and starts grappling onto you

01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.400
But again, it can't really do much. You can just feel like cold ghost fingers touching you and it's real creepy

01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:04.200
um, and then the demon boy is like

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.760
And he starts vomiting all over the place. Um

01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:13.320
So you guys got to make reflex saves. What are your reflex saves?

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:22.520
Two two plus two two two plus two or two well two an ability modifier two that's four, baby

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:24.200
um

01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:26.600
Cool. Okay, so both of you. Yeah

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:33.880
I keep not hitting you guys you both dodge, but uh, the ground is all slippery and slick with vomit

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:35.880
It's gross

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:36.600
um

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:42.040
Then just then the the mom and the dad burst in through the door and the dad's got a knife in the though

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.320
The mom has a flower pot that's sexist, but whatever

01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:48.760
It's a classic female weapon

01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.800
I mean

01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:55.960
No, she has a rolling pin. She's a rolling pin shaped like a vagina. Yeah

01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:58.840
Uh

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:04.200
And they're like leave our kids alone. You guys are the worst kids

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:08.120
Uh, yeah

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:15.320
Kids is one of them a ghost. Yeah one of them died about two months ago. We're still kind of

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:21.320
Dealing with it. What's his name? Uh, what's his name?

01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:24.920
Uh

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:26.920
Archer

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:30.920
Archer if you want to protect cliff you must work with us not again

01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.520
Well, you can't punch it kid to death

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:37.880
And kill the demon in sight

01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:41.000
Wait, I can't talk. I didn't say that

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:43.880
The ghost doesn't talk

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.880
I said that me the dm

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.680
Archer

01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:50.680
Help us

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.240
It looks at you with weird glowing eyes

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:59.880
And then it dives back into the to the boy and the boy starts thrashing around some more and laughing

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.760
Get out of my house

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.960
I'm going in

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:11.400
You're going into a little boy

01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:27.480
All right full disclosure I say to the parents like we're not really we know where this is our first time fighting a ghost

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:35.160
Demon and yeah, I asked uh tom and uh

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:40.920
Bonnie as a is is is the ghost that's possessing your child the dead other child

01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:49.160
Nah, I don't know man. This is confusing. We're just trying to follow the facts that ghost looked like you know the dead kid

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:55.480
Archer sidebar. Yeah, you know the only thing we haven't tried getting out of the house

01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:03.400
I mean it's like we were we're assuming we're so yeah, we thought you were gonna heal him. We didn't want you to kill him

01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:08.280
Sorry, you're sidebarring. I'll heal the damage. I caused by punching his face

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.160
But then I think our work is done here

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:16.360
thorough

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:19.080
Channel energy

01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:28.920
He gets healed them you like that. Yeah, it's funny to me. What else do you like?

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:32.920
Evil

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:39.080
You want some real cold soup you want some gross soup. Does that taste good to you? Are you like the Adams family?

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.960
Look where everything bad is good

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:44.920
Yeah, I'm like the Adams family

01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.680
Bonnie go make a bowl of horrible tasting soup

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:55.880
What the hell what are you guys doing? I have a plan don't question the church

01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.880
I

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:00.200
Don't know

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:06.520
I don't know what we're gonna get. We have to just get healing as a kid. We can just leave

01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:12.840
We don't we don't know what we're doing. Okay. Uh, I turn to them

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:20.680
And I do another dust check on the thing and I go look, uh, we're gonna be back. Yeah, we have we have a couple other

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:25.320
Uh leads to check out and uh, we'll make sure that we help your kid

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:30.760
And we're gonna redeem the church in your eyes or our name isn't

01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:34.040
Chad and Carlos

01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:36.280
In the meantime ask yourself

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:38.600
How is this your fault?

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.440
My pot is boiling over

01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:47.880
Dinner is ruined in addition to this terrible evening. Good the demon will like that

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:52.360
And then his mind will be blown that you're on his side. He might leave

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.560
He might be defined by opposition

01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:00.920
A lot of demons like to fight if you just give them bad soup, which they think is good soup

01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.560
They get confused and bored and they leave

01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:06.200
Try that we'll be back

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:14.600
I we walked down the hallway and I go Carlos like like you're supposed to be the healer guy

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:19.480
I'm a fire user. I healed him. I can't just burn everything and like you're supposed to like you threw

01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:23.160
Like we tried the holy water thing. We got the ghost out like what the fuck

01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:27.720
I don't we didn't get the ghost out the ghost came out like I it doesn't I'm look

01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:32.200
I don't know. I've never fought that kind of thing before. I don't I only can do so much. I can heal

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.520
I can cause wounds

01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:36.760
I can heal the wounds I cause

01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:42.920
Why don't we why don't we take it down the street and let's let's gather some information

01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:48.200
Let's let's let's grow as a team here. Yeah, I mean we might learn something. Yeah. I mean that kid's been

01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:53.400
possessed for what months. He seems fine. He'll keep

01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:59.320
A week a week. Yeah, what's another 10 minutes a day gonna do it seems like also

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.960
Lot of laughing seems like it's pretty fun

01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.760
Seems like everyone's a winner

01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:09.480
I didn't get a letter saying go to a farmhouse and help Bonnie, you know their kid

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:13.640
You know we should do we didn't bend the town these people probably aren't even why don't we go

01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:19.160
Why don't we go across the street and check out these burned out the houses that that the guy the neighbor james

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:24.680
And James yeah, we're gonna go check out some to the area

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:31.560
Well, we walk over to the james burned out buildings. Should we should we call it lose that a good stopping point?

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:35.720
No, we didn't do shit. Well, it's 10. I mean we've been to dad this for an hour, right?

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:38.360
I mean we've been doing this

01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:42.360
Yeah, like a half hour. Oh, we can keep going. I'm sorry. No, I just thought it was

01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:48.760
It's 10 o'clock. Maybe we just wouldn't be ending on any applause as you guys are dooming me to have to do some kind of rapper

01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:50.840
Yeah, yeah, that's what I would love you to crap

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:59.240
All right, put put that phone pick back on your head and uh, let's do some rapping

01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:04.280
We didn't do anything. We went into a room and I was like, I think you guys did a lot

01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:08.600
But that's like the cold open of our movie. Like it's like we're bad at what we're doing like

01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:13.480
And that makes the audience resonate with us. They're like, yeah, I don't know what I would have done either

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:17.160
Like that guy's like protection from evil like fuck you. You don't know what you're talking about

01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:25.240
Like like and not that we're saying if you yeah, I'm just saying like I got a bunch of spells that are like, yeah, I tried

01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:31.160
We're out of our league. Yeah, I took out some spells that relate to evil

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:39.160
Because they're overpowered. Okay, like detect evil would be kind of an anti-climax. Yeah, I wouldn't use that right away

01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:41.640
All right, Zach you got a beat back there?

01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:45.160
