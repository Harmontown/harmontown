don't really have a Pringles Dick, I just keep my dick inside.\n\n00:42.880 --> 00:49.280\nI keep my dick inside a Pringles can, because it keeps my penis safe and dry.\n\n00:49.280 --> 00:53.600\nSome people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out.\n\n00:53.600 --> 00:55.280\nNo, I never found out.\n\n00:55.280 --> 00:58.920\nI never really found out why, if you know, sing along.\n\n00:58.920 --> 01:05.280\nSome people call me Pringles Dick, but I never found out why.\n\n01:05.280 --> 01:11.760\nI don't really have a Pringles Dick, I just keep my dick

01:41.800\nFrom beautiful uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n01:41.800 --> 01:43.800\nSpencer Crittenden.\n\n01:43.800 --> 02:03.480\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown, I missed you so much, Mr. Dan Harmons.\n\n02:03.480 --> 02:17.400\nThank you.\n\n02:17.400 --> 02:22.320\nYou left your shit everywhere.\n\n02:22.320 --> 02:30.000\nHow does the video, should I put this back further out, or should I, okay, you're good.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:34.840\nAll right, when I watch the feed, I like the shot where you get a clear shot of Spencer\n\n02:34.840 --> 02:37.360\nand then the mannequins back there, it looks beautiful.\n\n02:37.360 --> 02:41.040\nFive dollars a month, and you'd know what I was talking about.\n\n02:41.040 --> 02:45.280\nThank you guys for coming out, thanks for coming to Burbank, thanks for living in Burbank,\n\n02:45.280 --> 02:46.280\nif you live here.\n\n02:46.280 --> 02:53.200\nSomebody have a pen I can borrow for the show, anybody pen, pencil?\n\n02:53.200 --> 02:59.000\nThere's a little bit of official business, you know, we, I mean, we've been getting\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:07.200\nthis venue up and running, and we can't be an official, we can't sell you booze, so great,\n\n03:07.200 --> 03:15.240\nwe have to give it to you for, that's, I love that about society, that it has, legally\n\n03:15.240 --> 03:22.920\nit has to be free, okay, that's the kind of Pringles professor you like, you know, like\n\n03:22.920 --> 03:26.880\nhe stops the party in the library and says like, you need to read books about Pringles\n\n03:26.880 --> 03:37.080\nthen, and it had no sense, but it's like free flowing hard liquor, but I don't think that's\n\n03:37.080 --> 03:42.920\nthe problem, as you know, if you're here live, we had to start checking your bags tonight,\n\n03:42.920 --> 03:49.120\nnow here's why, you're coming here to listen to me complain about our dissent into fascism\n\n03:49.120 --> 03:54.640\nand now you have to, pretty soon there's going to be metal detectors out there, what can\n\n03:54.640 --> 04:03.120\nI say about Burbank, it's a tougher hood, man, what it is, we've got a nice big room\n\n04:03.120 --> 04:08.200\nnow, we can fit a lot of you in here, there's a free spirit, we're anarchists, we love,\n\n04:08.200 --> 04:15.000\nwe love no rules, somebody's got something to say, they say it, et cetera, but you know,\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:20.480\nso now it's like, okay, how do we coexist as a civilization, people have been bringing\n\n04:20.480 --> 04:25.640\nshit and getting shit faced, like if you just brought stuff, maybe it's illegal for me to\n\n04:25.640 --> 04:29.480\nsay this, but if you just brought stuff and you could see, there you go, you heard somebody\n\n04:29.480 --> 04:35.920\nright there falling over, but like, I mean, just anecdotally, there were a couple of guys\n\n04:35.920 --> 04:41.560\napparently last episode, or maybe one before that, I can't remember, but you know, we just\n\n04:41.560 --> 04:52.920\nhave your standard security people, they didn't sign up to do any heart surgery or, you know,\n\n04:52.920 --> 04:56.400\nthey had to like, bounce a couple guys and I guess one guy immediately as soon as he\n\n04:56.400 --> 05:01.520\ngot, because they were just shit faced, like walking into walls, and then they went out\n\n05:01.520 --> 05:08.960\nas a pair and one of them, the official report on our side was that he turned to Jell-O,\n\n05:08.960 --> 05:14.840\nhe fell to the floor and started pissing and shitting himself, and couldn't get up, his\n\n05:14.840 --> 05:22.960\nfriend took off running because he had a $50,000 warrant, so thank you for letting us check\n\n05:22.960 --> 05:30.200\nyour purse, it's not you, it's those two guys, but also it's like, I'm sorry if I caught\n\n05:30.200 --> 05:32.920\nyou off guard, because it's like, well maybe you have weed in your purse and you're like,\n\n05:32.920 --> 05:38.920\nwhat is this, the fucking thing, there's also been people like smoking in there, you know,\n\n05:38.920 --> 05:45.280\nin the inside here, and it's like, it's all, if you just run it through the flowchart of\n\n05:45.280 --> 05:51.440\nlike, am I hurting anyone around me, am I interfering with anyone else's good time,\n\n05:51.440 --> 05:57.680\nwhich also doubles as when a cop comes in here, is this place going to get shut down,\n\n05:57.680 --> 06:01.840\nbecause that cheats everybody, so in order to keep honest people honest, we're just kind\n\n06:01.840 --> 06:05.480\nof going, okay, so you can't be, you know, we're going to check your bags and stuff,\n\n06:05.480 --> 06:11.560\nbut this is, I'm not looking at this as a, this is our chance to explore how societies\n\n06:11.560 --> 06:16.840\nbegin, I'm sure, minus the electronics, this is basically equivalent to the first Thanksgiving,\n\n06:16.840 --> 06:17.840\nright?\n\n06:17.840 --> 06:26.120\nSo like, listen, some of you, I understand you make houses out of buffalo, look, we love\n\n06:26.120 --> 06:34.520\nit, but, I don't know, but you've got to accept these smallpox, it's called a social\n\n06:34.520 --> 06:41.600\ncontract, but anyways, that's that, so if any of you are miffed by that, you can continue\n\n06:41.600 --> 06:44.760\nto be miffed by that, I'm not telling you to not be miffed by any invasion of your\n\n06:44.760 --> 06:51.080\nstuff, but it's like, we're just doing what we can to bottleneck the inhumanity, so that\n\n06:51.080 --> 07:00.600\neverybody can have a good time, and the other official business is Jeff's back, hello.\n\n07:00.600 --> 07:03.680\nI missed you guys, it's been a long time.\n\n07:03.680 --> 07:06.560\nI've been enjoying listening to the show, though, I thought Brandon did a bang up job.\n\n07:06.560 --> 07:09.640\nBrandon is amazing.\n\n07:09.640 --> 07:15.480\nI kind of felt like, not nervous to come back, but I felt like maybe like he had stolen\n\n07:15.480 --> 07:18.880\neverybody's hearts away, and like, I, like, I, I like what it's brought out of you.\n\n07:18.880 --> 07:21.680\nYou come back with a ukulele, there's this thing, it's good to see you on your toes.\n\n07:21.680 --> 07:26.840\nI felt like I had to, I had to put some hee-haw showbiz into this shit, like I, the, the,\n\n07:26.840 --> 07:32.760\nthe downside was it also brought out of a lash of racism, like you were, I mean, it just,\n\n07:32.760 --> 07:36.720\nit brought it, but I'd rather just have, yeah, just have all of you, you know, I think.\n\n07:36.720 --> 07:39.280\nYeah, yeah, he was, he was black the entire time.\n\n07:39.280 --> 07:40.280\nHe was black.\n\n07:40.280 --> 07:44.400\nAlso, I mean, I feel so nervous about coming back, and Spencer and I, and the halfway mark\n\n07:44.400 --> 07:46.840\nof the show, we're going to do love letters.\n\n07:46.840 --> 07:47.840\nYeah.\n\n07:47.840 --> 07:51.360\nYeah, it's a nice stage set up now, and we're going to continue.\n\n07:51.360 --> 07:54.120\nThat's a play that two people do.\n\n07:54.120 --> 07:57.720\nWe're moving toward, there's, there's going to be a wireless environment up here, it's\n\n07:57.720 --> 08:01.800\ngoing to be like going to an Apple Keynote pretty soon one day, it's going to be, I'm\n\n08:01.800 --> 08:05.240\ngoing to come, I'm going to come out in a turtleneck, or maybe, maybe a turtle in a\n\n08:05.240 --> 08:06.240\nhalf-neck.\n\n08:06.240 --> 08:08.320\nI just, I just wrote that.\n\n08:08.320 --> 08:10.360\nA turtle in a half-neck.\n\n08:10.360 --> 08:11.360\nThat's pretty awesome.\n\n08:11.360 --> 08:15.800\nIt's like, it comes up to your lower lip, like, I don't know, the new, I just, I just\n\n08:15.800 --> 08:19.040\nfigured I'm two turtle, one and a half turtles, I don't know, it's pretty good, I don't know,\n\n08:19.040 --> 08:20.040\nI'm kind of good.\n\n08:20.040 --> 08:23.800\nI mean, you know, this venue's like awakening the entertainer in it, a turtle in a half-neck.\n\n08:23.800 --> 08:28.800\nSee, I, I, my ukulele inspired the vaudeville showbiz guy inside you.\n\n08:28.800 --> 08:29.800\nYeah.\n\n08:29.800 --> 08:34.320\nYeah, let's, let's, do you want to try, let's try something real quick, speaking of, because\n\n08:34.320 --> 08:39.920\nwe were testing the equipment and, you know, so, you know, oh, Harmon, try to strike a\n\n08:39.920 --> 08:43.120\nbalance between the, you know, you don't want to turn it into a TV show, because the people\n\n08:43.120 --> 08:49.980\nlistening, but that doesn't preclude, like, the music stuff, so I got my, I got my garage\n\n08:49.980 --> 08:55.800\nband and you got your ukulele and then, oh, awesome, why should I get my ukulele in it?\n\n08:55.800 --> 09:05.600\nWell, yeah, yeah, well, I mean, if you want, yeah, I'm, yeah, I've been enjoying, if you\n\n09:05.600 --> 09:10.280\nguys have not treated yourself to Dan's garage band, like little Instagram videos are pretty,\n\n09:10.280 --> 09:11.280\npretty tasty.\n\n09:11.280 --> 09:12.280\nYeah.\n\n09:12.280 --> 09:15.680\nYou can really find out what it's like to hear Dan sing about pooping.\n\n09:15.680 --> 09:18.120\nOh, oh, what are you, what are you talking about?\n\n09:18.120 --> 09:22.280\nYou're saying, oh, well, I guess since I opened GarageBand, I might as well play one of my\n\n09:22.280 --> 09:23.280\nsongs.\n\n09:23.280 --> 09:24.280\nI think you should.\n\n09:24.280 --> 09:25.280\nHave you got to do it?\n\n09:25.280 --> 09:26.280\nYeah, this is a lesson.\n\n09:26.280 --> 09:27.280\nNo, let's go to Classics.\n\n09:27.280 --> 09:30.280\nSing and, so, from outer space\n\n09:30.280 --> 09:32.280\nFor those of you who are fine following Dan you should sing\n\n09:32.280 --> 09:33.280\nCena's\n\n09:33.280 --> 09:35.280\nACLLEY\n\n09:35.280 --> 09:38.280\nSuperman's place\n\n09:38.280 --> 09:41.280\nFrom your great friend\n\n09:41.280 --> 09:42.340\nWe're criminal\n\n09:42.340 --> 09:45.060\nIt's where you come from where other beings grow\n\n09:45.060 --> 09:47.260\nI'm just a lonely potato\n\n09:47.260 --> 09:49.160\nI only know what I know\n\n09:49.160 --> 09:50.320\nAnd I know\n\n09:50.320 --> 09:52.640\nI was born in the dirt\n\n09:52.640 --> 09:54.640\nand the Earth is the nausea\n\n09:54.640 --> 10:04.640\nBut now I can't look, I'm probably at my beam from outer space\n\n10:07.640 --> 10:09.640\nSee\n\n10:10.640 --> 10:11.640\nWow\n\n10:15.640 --> 10:17.640\nThat one I did for my beam, Cody\n\n10:17.640 --> 10:22.640\nThat was somewhere right in the middle, like equidistant between Lenny Kravitz and Abba\n\n10:22.640 --> 10:27.640\nWith a lengthy stop at George Michael's filling station\n\n10:27.640 --> 10:28.640\nOh yeah, yeah\n\n10:28.640 --> 10:31.640\nIt's where you come from where other beans grow\n\n10:31.640 --> 10:35.640\nI'm just a lonely potato, I only know what I know\n\n10:35.640 --> 10:38.640\nAnd I know I was born in the dirt\n\n10:41.640 --> 10:44.640\nYou should have a fucking record, you could have a record, Dan\n\n10:44.640 --> 10:47.640\nI'm gonna see if logical maybe produced my album\n\n10:47.640 --> 10:48.640\nYeah\n\n10:48.640 --> 10:54.640\nNow that he's number one, boy is he gonna regret becoming friends with me before he became a number one hip-hop artist\n\n10:55.640 --> 10:58.640\nI'm like texting him every day, I'm like, what do you think of this?\n\n10:58.640 --> 11:00.640\nHe's like, it's hip-hop delicious\n\n11:00.640 --> 11:03.640\nI have to say that from the time I was away listening to the show\n\n11:03.640 --> 11:06.640\nYou grew a lot because you started fucking dads now, that's great\n\n11:06.640 --> 11:09.640\nI tried, I tried everything, you know\n\n11:10.640 --> 11:14.640\nAlright, well yeah, but okay, so my new thing is garagemen\n\n11:14.640 --> 11:18.640\nBecause you don't have to be good at it, it's a hobby for me now\n\n11:18.640 --> 11:20.640\nSo I can really lose myself in it\n\n11:20.640 --> 11:25.640\nSo you were telling me a good chord progression is\n\n11:25.640 --> 11:27.640\nOh shit, this doesn't have the, where is the...\n\n11:27.640 --> 11:29.640\nYeah, you made a new song\n\n11:29.640 --> 11:31.640\nWhere's the D?\n\n11:31.640 --> 11:33.640\nGo back to the old song that you did\n\n11:33.640 --> 11:35.640\nIt's okay, we can do CGFs, gotcha\n\n11:35.640 --> 11:41.640\nOkay, so I'm learning as people are paying to watch\n\n11:41.640 --> 11:44.640\nThat's fine, that's fine\n\n11:45.640 --> 11:47.640\nThe good thing for people listening and not watching\n\n11:47.640 --> 11:49.640\nIs there's nothing happening on the screen, really, worth watching\n\n11:49.640 --> 11:51.640\nNo, no, we're not, yeah\n\n11:51.640 --> 11:54.640\nBut yeah, my favorite thing about garagemen is the strings\n\n11:54.640 --> 11:57.640\nBecause if you rub them hard, it gets...\n\n11:59.640 --> 12:01.640\nBut if you rub them really soft\n\n12:01.640 --> 12:09.640\nIt's been seven hours and fifteen days\n\n12:14.640 --> 12:15.640\nWait, you said it\n\n12:15.640 --> 12:16.640\nWe almost had it\n\n12:16.640 --> 12:23.640\nD, G, A, C, D\n\n12:23.640 --> 12:26.640\nIs that, can we hop this mic back up, the other guy?\n\n12:28.640 --> 12:29.640\nOh man\n\n12:29.640 --> 12:31.640\nSo D, G, A, 7, D\n\n12:31.640 --> 12:34.640\nYeah, that's a nice three chord kind of thing\n\n12:36.640 --> 12:38.640\nOh, I guess we probably need a metronome, right?\n\n12:38.640 --> 12:40.640\nYeah, give me a beat\n\n12:43.640 --> 12:46.640\nCan you put an actual, can you lay a beat in there?\n\n12:46.640 --> 12:47.640\nYeah, I could\n\n12:47.640 --> 12:48.640\nGive us a beat\n\n12:48.640 --> 12:50.640\nWhat would you like the drummer's name to be?\n\n12:53.640 --> 12:55.640\nI'm a fucking Tommy Lee\n\n12:55.640 --> 12:59.640\nUh, SoCal?\n\n13:01.640 --> 13:02.640\nSoCal\n\n13:02.640 --> 13:03.640\nWait, I thought...\n\n13:03.640 --> 13:05.640\nOkay, wait, well, no, wait, how come...\n\n13:06.640 --> 13:09.640\nOkay, now that people aren't watching or missing something\n\n13:09.640 --> 13:11.640\nBecause now there's drums on the thing\n\n13:11.640 --> 13:12.640\nWait, this is very exciting\n\n13:12.640 --> 13:14.640\nI think it's different if you get a drummer\n\n13:14.640 --> 13:16.640\nOkay, drummer, that's what I need\n\n13:17.640 --> 13:18.640\nOkay, you want Lea here?\n\n13:18.640 --> 13:20.640\nThis is like the scene in the movie Iceman\n\n13:20.640 --> 13:25.640\nThe Iceman finds out that he's an Iceman\n\n13:26.640 --> 13:29.640\nIs that to Silver Lake for you?\n\n13:29.640 --> 13:32.640\nWould you like me to change Lea?\n\n13:32.640 --> 13:36.640\nI could change Lea to Jay Fister\n\n13:41.640 --> 13:43.640\nHe's too complicated\n\n13:43.640 --> 13:47.640\nI don't need your parents' divorce involved in my song\n\n13:47.640 --> 13:51.640\nMaurice looks like

--> 18:00.240\nBetter than men\n\n18:00.240 --> 18:05.240\nHow come women are so much better than men?\n\n18:05.240 --> 18:09.240\nHow come all women are better than men?\n\n18:09.240 --> 18:11.240\nDoes it matter what note you sing?\n\n18:11.240 --> 18:12.240\nDo you do the chords?\n\n18:12.240 --> 18:13.240\nAre they on their day?\n\n18:13.240 --> 18:15.240\nDo you have to sing along with the chords?\n\n18:15.240 --> 18:16.240\nDo you know it?\n\n18:16.240 --> 18:18.240\nDo you just sing it to the throat?\n\n18:21.240 --> 18:22.240\nYes or no?\n\n18:22.240 --> 18:23.240\nYes or no?\n\n18:26.240 --> 18:32.240\nWell, it's nice to be back in the heart of the town\n\n18:36.240 --> 18:38.240\nIt's nice to be back\n\n18:38.240 --> 18:40.240\nOh shit, I fucked up\n\n18:41.240 --> 18:42.240\nAlright, one more time\n\n18:42.240 --> 18:44.240\nJust wanna get those strings right and then we'll move on\n\n18:45.240 --> 18:47.240\nBecause I feel like the velocity's not...\n\n18:47.240 --> 18:48.240\nI'm not...\n\n18:48.240 --> 18:52.240\nThe velocity's fucked\n\n19:02.240 --> 19:04.240\nIt's the double D, that's what gets you\n\n19:04.240 --> 19:05.240\nYeah\n\n19:05.240 --> 19:06.240\nEvery time\n\n19:06.240 --> 19:19.240\nAlright, one more time then we'll get to the show\n\n19:27.240 --> 19:29.240\nThat's the one\n\n19:29.240 --> 19:39.240\nI fucking miss Ryan Stiles so much right now\n\n19:39.240 --> 19:40.240\nNo, I miss Brandon\n\n19:40.240 --> 19:41.240\nLet's get Brandon up here\n\n19:41.240 --> 19:43.240\nBrandon Johnson!\n\n19:51.240 --> 19:52.240\nHi\n\n19:53.240 --> 19:56.240\nGod damn it, that was hilarious\n\n19:56.240 --> 19:58.240\nI love that last bit where you were\n\n19:58.240 --> 20:00.240\nI give a fuck\n\n20:01.240 --> 20:03.240\nJeff James is back everybody\n\n20:05.240 --> 20:06.240\nYes\n\n20:07.240 --> 20:12.240\nAnd I can go back to being the disgraced alderman of Harmontown\n\n20:12.240 --> 20:14.240\nYeah, you did such a good job\n\n20:14.240 --> 20:15.240\nI was afraid to come back\n\n20:15.240 --> 20:17.240\nI thought that you...\n\n20:17.240 --> 20:20.240\nI liked your version of the show better than me on the show\n\n20:20.240 --> 20:23.240\nI can only tell you big shoes to fill\n\n20:23.240 --> 20:25.240\nFucking, I had no idea what goes on\n\n20:25.240 --> 20:27.240\nThere's an entire gold panel behind that thing\n\n20:27.240 --> 20:28.240\nIt took you two hours of this shit\n\n20:28.240 --> 20:30.240\nThat's the fucking hard part\n\n20:30.240 --> 20:35.240\nBig, big fancy shoes that only you two know how to talk about\n\n20:35.240 --> 20:37.240\nI like those loafers by the way, those are swinging\n\n20:37.240 --> 20:39.240\nThanks so much, you look amazing\n\n20:39.240 --> 20:41.240\nThe chain with the jacket\n\n20:41.240 --> 20:42.240\nYeah, please\n\n20:42.240 --> 20:44.240\nI can't wear brown shoes, I look like I've heard it\n\n20:49.240 --> 20:52.240\nSo much has changed since you left\n\n20:52.240 --> 20:54.240\nHe hates it so much\n\n20:54.240 --> 20:58.240\nThere was one episode when you had the journalists that had been overseas\n\n20:58.240 --> 21:00.240\nLike in Iraq and stuff like that\n\n21:00.240 --> 21:02.240\nAnd you kept asking them questions\n\n21:02.240 --> 21:04.240\nWell, you started the show by saying that you were really drunk\n\n21:04.240 --> 21:06.240\nAnd you interviewed them\n\n21:06.240 --> 21:10.240\nYou kept asking questions and then answering their question for them\n\n21:10.240 --> 21:12.240\nAnd I came up with a new term\n\n21:12.240 --> 21:14.240\nIt's called dance planning\n\n21:18.240 --> 21:20.240\nI told, I'm not a good interviewer\n\n21:20.240 --> 21:23.240\nI thought it was a good show, I don't care\n\n21:24.240 --> 21:26.240\nIt was, they were fascinating\n\n21:26.240 --> 21:28.240\nTheoretically\n\n21:28.240 --> 21:32.240\nI heard a psychology, there was a podcast about emotions\n\n21:32.240 --> 21:39.240\nThat I saw that said that there's this woman who's like the leading rock star\n\n21:39.240 --> 21:41.240\nOf emotional psychology right now\n\n21:41.240 --> 21:44.240\nBut it's really weird because she's kind of counterintuitive\n\n21:44.240 --> 21:51.240\nShe realizes herself that her theories and findings actually fly in the face\n\n21:51.240 --> 21:59.240\nOf any support for the kind of the safe space, trickery thing\n\n21:59.240 --> 22:02.240\nIn that feelings don't happen to you\n\n22:02.240 --> 22:04.240\nThey're not uncontrollable things\n\n22:06.240 --> 22:09.240\nI was kind of half asleep while I was listening to the podcast\n\n22:09.240 --> 22:16.240\nThe weird thing is, I don't know who figures this shit out\n\n22:16.240 --> 22:19.240\nHow do you measure this and who do you know is talking out of their ass\n\n22:19.240 --> 22:24.240\nThat's why you have to look at certification and stuff and credentials\n\n22:24.240 --> 22:31.240\nBut according to her, there's only really four actual honest emotional states\n\n22:31.240 --> 22:33.240\nFor a human that you start with\n\n22:33.240 --> 22:40.240\nI think it's pleasant, unpleasant, aroused, and I can't remember\n\n22:40.240 --> 22:44.240\nGroupon, I don't know, I can't remember what the fourth one is even\n\n22:44.240 --> 22:45.240\nShifty\n\n22:45.240 --> 22:48.240\nBut it's not angry and it's not jealous and it's not sad\n\n22:48.240 --> 22:53.240\nI can't remember what it is, but it's basically the way that there's only really eight notes\n\n22:53.240 --> 23:00.240\nThere's only four feelings, but then we, depending culturally\n\n23:00.240 --> 23:03.240\nIf you're in ancient Sparta, then you have to have a certain attitude\n\n23:03.240 --> 23:07.240\nTowards murder, death, manhood, womanhood, etc\n\n23:07.240 --> 23:13.240\nThen if you go down the street to ancient Athens, they're working on the streets\n\n23:13.240 --> 23:22.240\nBut all of that stuff, all the stuff that we call outrage or jealousy or sadness or rage\n\n23:22.240 --> 23:31.240\nThose are all social constructs that we're creating, that we're told, we're indoctrinated into them\n\n23:31.240 --> 23:36.240\nSo when you're a kid on the playground and someone steals your fire truck toy\n\n23:36.240 --> 23:40.240\nYou feel probably, I would guess, unpleasant about that\n\n23:40.240 --> 23:44.240\nAnd then your parents tell you, or the kid that's taking your fire truck tells you\n\n23:44.240 --> 23:48.240\nOr somehow you get the signal, you're told, I know you're angry right now\n\n23:48.240 --> 23:53.240\nWhat you're feeling is called anger and it has to do with fire trucks being taken away from you\n\n23:53.240 --> 23:57.240\nAnd so you learn that the same way you learn language\n\n23:57.240 --> 24:01.240\nBut there's very few uncontrollable emotions, like you just kind of\n\n24:01.240 --> 24:12.240\nYou have a pretty mellow four-part quartet of pretty almost indistinguishable kind of states of emotion\n\n24:12.240 --> 24:19.240\nThat you then, I didn't really listen to it that much\n\n24:19.240 --> 24:23.240\nBut she herself was saying, I know this is awful because she's a liberal and a progressive person\n\n24:23.240 --> 24:28.240\nBut she's saying, this is honest data that I'm getting about, this is the way we really need to look at this\n\n24:28.240 --> 24:37.240\nEven though it actually suggests, it's kind of like the scientific way of saying suck it up buttercup in certain contexts\n\n24:37.240 --> 24:42.240\nDoes that allow for nuances in between? You can be angry and different, okay\n\n24:42.240 --> 24:45.240\nNo, no, our next guest\n\n24:45.240 --> 24:52.240\nAt the top of the podcast episode, they say, because they're doing, and if I'm drawing at them, I should cite them\n\n24:52.240 --> 24:56.240\nIt's called invisibilia, that's the name of the podcast\n\n24:56.240 --> 25:05.240\nAt the top of the podcast they say, by the way, we've discovered a fifth emotional state\n\n25:05.240 --> 25:09.240\nSo it's called ugut or something like that, and we'll get to that later\n\n25:09.240 --> 25:17.240\nThey've found a tribe of people that can feel a fifth thing, I know it sounds absurd, but they have to agree\n\n25:17.240 --> 25:22.240\nThe Jackson family\n\n25:22.240 --> 25:29.240\nBut that fifth one is called germane\n\n25:29.240 --> 25:36.240\nBring up my fancy mind map\n\n25:36.240 --> 25:41.240\nSee, we just talked about that\n\n25:41.240 --> 25:43.240\nLet's go to Twitter, shall we?\n\n25:43.240 --> 25:48.240\nYeah, with a quick stop\n\n25:48.240 --> 26:03.240\nWhen we were doing a...\n\n26:03.240 --> 26:09.240\nLoop, I got a perfect loop\n\n26:09.240 --> 26:14.240\nI got a perfect loop, I nailed this loop this time\n\n26:14.240 --> 26:18.240\nWe'll get back to that later\n\n26:18.240 --> 26:22.240\nI just wanted to nail it, it was like a bike that stole me\n\n26:22.240 --> 26:27.240\nWhen we were doing soundcheck earlier, Dan plugged this thing in to make sure the audio and video was working\n\n26:27.240 --> 26:32.240\nEverybody, a quick porn check, he had to make sure he wasn't going to turn his computer on\n\n26:32.240 --> 26:36.240\nYou would all get bombarded with mannequin porn or whatever\n\n26:36.240 --> 26:39.240\nAlright, who's this guy? Blind melanade\n\n26:39.240 --> 26:44.240\nCan you fix Dan's mic, it's super low, and then the music blows my speakers up\n\n26:44.240 --> 26:47.240\nI assume that person's...\n\n26:47.240 --> 26:53.240\nEvery week we get people that say that the sound's way too low, and I wonder if they just have broken sound\n\n26:53.240 --> 26:57.240\nI'll be back later\n\n26:57.240 --> 27:03.240\nI have a show to do\n\n27:03.240 --> 27:07.240\nAlright\n\n27:07.240 --> 27:12.240\nCould you please just say fuck Patrick O'Leary, I guess I accidentally just did\n\n27:12.240 --> 27:16.240\nIs that a senator? I hope it's a senator\n\n27:16.240 --> 27:24.240\nA survivalism question I like to ask folks says Johnny Collins, whose Twitter name is Silver Tin Tine Music\n\n27:24.240 --> 27:29.240\nI feel Spencer may have some good ideas, sorry for the mini manifesto\n\n27:29.240 --> 27:32.240\nWhat's this guy's name?\n\n27:32.240 --> 27:34.240\nOh good\n\n27:34.240 --> 27:39.240\nI feel like I'm in a porn country, we're going to see my porn any minute now\n\n27:39.240 --> 27:42.240\nJohnny Collins\n\n27:42.240 --> 27:45.240\nA survivalism question I like to ask folks\n\n27:45.240 --> 27:47.240\nJust cut to the bottom\n\n27:47.240 --> 27:51.240\nI click on those images, oh Jesus, and then it starts to go haywire\n\n27:51.240 --> 27:54.240\nI really need you to just tweet, just tweet, will you people?\n\n27:54.240 --> 28:01.240\nYou can't just don't tweet a link to a thing, you're going to find out what I jerk off to you so fast\n\n28:01.240 --> 28:06.240\nWhat if you had a guess right now, it would be in the chamber in your porn windows right now\n\n28:06.240 --> 28:10.240\nWe see if we came across it by accident\n\n28:10.240 --> 28:16.240\nDo you want me to tell people the thing I'm worried they'll know?\n\n28:16.240 --> 28:19.240\nYeah, describe it for us\n\n28:19.240 --> 28:22.240\nYou have to take the power away from them, man\n\n28:22.240 --> 28:26.240\nIt's probably just hoverboard cut ventures or whatever\n\n28:26.240 --> 28:29.240\nBy the way, worry is not a feeling\n\n28:29.240 --> 28:40.240\nIt would be unpleasant for one split second of my bookmarks to haunt me for 40 years of potential political career\n\n28:40.240 --> 28:44.240\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, how offensive do you think it would be?\n\n28:44.240 --> 28:50.240\nI think there's some hot buttons, I think that we're not a sexually progressive community\n\n28:50.240 --> 28:54.240\nI think that we all have little places that we go\n\n28:54.240 --> 28:57.240\nIt's incest, it must be\n\n28:57.240 --> 29:01.240\nIt doesn't make sense if this were like clown porn or something, that would be a weird speech\n\n29:01.240 --> 29:05.240\nBut remember Riley Reed said incest is best\n\n29:05.240 --> 29:09.240\nShe said incest is like way up on the porn hub searches\n\n29:09.240 --> 29:14.240\nBecause anything that you could think of that's taboo, it's like\n\n29:14.240 --> 29:20.240\nBut I see these arguments online where people go like, oh, it's like, and you can't, there's no heroes or villains in these stories\n\n29:20.240 --> 29:27.240\nThis is what the internet is doing to all of us, it's like creating lack of context that is incredibly damaging to us\n\n29:27.240 --> 29:36.240\nI've asked it before and I wish we could, I wish we had a love connection, like private kind of polling ability\n\n29:36.240 --> 29:40.240\nWhich I've said years ago so that we could actually ask the folks that come to these shows\n\n29:40.240 --> 29:48.240\nThings that they can answer honestly without any fear that they're having to clap when we say who here wants to fuck a dog\n\n29:48.240 --> 29:51.240\nThat they can just\n\n29:55.240 --> 30:01.240\nBut I do want to know kind of from millennials and then compare that like a kind of Kenzie investigation\n\n30:01.240 --> 30:07.240\nLike Kenzie, like I want to know like our millennial cousins\n\n30:07.240 --> 30:15.240\nLike are they more or less like taboo in the bedroom\n\n30:15.240 --> 30:21.240\nLike are they, I mean one person can yell out more, it's Annie in the front\n\n30:21.240 --> 30:30.240\nBut I know that there's no answer for one generation, but you want to aggregate that data and compare it to people 20 years older\n\n30:30.240 --> 30:34.240\nAnd go like, I don't know how you'd measure it, but I'm just really curious about that sometimes\n\n30:34.240 --> 30:39.240\nBecause my relationship with Cody, I don't think she'd mind me saying\n\n30:39.240 --> 30:49.240\nWe go to dark places and we do a lot of characters and there's a lot of narrative work that goes into, and it happens\n\n30:49.240 --> 30:53.240\nDo you guys ever do accents, like different dialects and things like that?\n\n30:53.240 --> 30:55.240\nDo you know?\n\n30:55.240 --> 30:58.240\nLike are you ever like Count Dracula or some shit?\n\n30:58.240 --> 30:59.240\nNo, but I was\n\n30:59.240 --> 31:01.240\nI want to suck your teeth\n\n31:01.240 --> 31:04.240\nDo you guys ever do table reads?\n\n31:04.240 --> 31:05.240\nWhat's that?\n\n31:05.240 --> 31:07.240\nDo you ever do table reads, some of your best stuff?\n\n31:07.240 --> 31:12.240\nTable reads, sorry I meant you repeat your joke 9 times\n\n31:12.240 --> 31:15.240\nNo, it wasn't worth repeating any of those times, I would say\n\n31:15.240 --> 31:19.240\nCan you return Rob Schrab's text?\n\n31:19.240 --> 31:21.240\nAnswer the question, have you ever done an accent?\n\n31:21.240 --> 31:23.240\nHave you ever played like a foreign character?\n\n31:23.240 --> 31:27.240\nNo, I mean I guess the closest would be I was recently pretty high-ranking Catholic\n\n31:27.240 --> 31:32.240\nSo I probably have a lot of Italian friends\n\n31:32.240 --> 31:37.240\nOn that popo shit or that big old\n\n31:37.240 --> 31:39.240\nDid you do like an Italian accent?\n\n31:39.240 --> 31:41.240\nNo, I was just making a joke\n\n31:41.240 --> 31:44.240\nYour Fred Stoller impression was pretty good last week, I thought that was pretty good\n\n31:44.240 --> 31:47.240\nYou should role play as Fred Stoller, that would be amazing\n\n31:47.240 --> 31:50.240\nThis person says the stream keeps cutting out and they said that 22 minutes ago\n\n31:50.240 --> 31:55.240\nBut I think it's possible they might be experiencing, we're not starting the show yet, I don't know\n\n31:55.240 --> 31:57.240\nNot to be a dick, but the stream keeps cutting out\n\n31:57.240 --> 31:59.240\nThey might have slow internet\n\n31:59.240 --> 32:04.240\nWho's alive tonight? America, why aren't you up on stage yet?\n\n32:04.240 --> 32:07.240\nThat's Rob Schrab's voice\n\n32:07.240 --> 32:09.240\nHe's eating carrots\n\n32:09.240 --> 32:13.240\nWhen will you fuck it, I'm eating some carrots, it wouldn't have killed you to return my text\n\n32:19.240 --> 32:23.240\nRob is trolling us from outer space right now?\n\n32:23.240 --> 32:28.240\nPlease say there's a million from Rob Schrab\n\n32:28.240 --> 32:33.240\nI'll look at it, his text is just, here's the thing, Rob's a fucking asshole\n\n32:33.240 --> 32:38.240\nEvery Thursday we're supposed to hang out, we have it on our schedules\n\n32:38.240 --> 32:43.240\nWe're old men, we know we're busy, so we only hang out if we schedule it\n\n32:43.240 --> 32:47.240\nSo we schedule it every Thursday, Harmon and Schrab hang out\n\n32:47.240 --> 32:58.240\nSo then he goes, I go, you know, we were going to try to catch up on Twin Peaks because I have showtime and he's cheap\n\n32:58.240 --> 33:04.240\nAnd I was like, hey, what about Twin Peaks?\n\n33:04.240 --> 33:08.240\nHe goes, I thought you cancelled tonight, I said when did you think that?\n\n33:08.240 --> 33:11.240\nHe says, I got an email saying tonight is cancelled, I'm like what?\n\n33:11.240 --> 33:15.240\nAnd he sends me a screen grab, that's clearly he's just confused\n\n33:15.240 --> 33:19.240\nIt's like one of those auto emails that gets sent because Levy's schedules are hangouts\n\n33:19.240 --> 33:23.240\nAnd it says updated invitation, weekly Schrab hang\n\n33:23.240 --> 33:28.240\nAnd it's for the following week because I'm going out of town for Cody's mom's birthday\n\n33:28.240 --> 33:33.240\nSo he sends it, and this is the biggest dick move, even for Schrab\n\n33:33.240 --> 33:37.240\nHe sends that and you can tell he just saw it as he sends it\n\n33:37.240 --> 33:41.240\nSo he sees the dates for next week\n\n33:41.240 --> 33:46.240\nAnd then he says, I got this too\n\n33:46.240 --> 33:49.240\nBut I couldn't decipher it, you see what I'm saying?\n\n33:49.240 --> 33:52.240\nHe said, I thought you cancelled tonight, I'm like what?\n\n33:52.240 --> 33:54.240\nAnd he's like, how about this?\n\n33:54.240 --> 33:58.240\nAnd he looks at it, that too\n\n33:58.240 --> 34:01.240\nBut there's no first thing, like he's just a fucking idiot\n\n34:01.240 --> 34:04.240\nAnd I said, all right, whatever, I'll play video games\n\n34:04.240 --> 34:07.240\nAnd he said, AG's coming over if you want to come here\n\n34:07.240 --> 34:11.240\nAnd I said, that email is about next week and when you noticed that you said, I also got this\n\n34:11.240 --> 34:13.240\nBut I never saw an email canceling tonight\n\n34:13.240 --> 34:17.240\nAnd Schrab said, I deleted it already\n\n34:17.240 --> 34:20.240\nThen another text just come over\n\n34:20.240 --> 34:26.240\nThen finally a third text, I made a mistake, too late\n\n34:26.240 --> 34:31.240\nThen a fourth text, where are you with four question marks?\n\n34:31.240 --> 34:34.240\nI won, is what that means\n\n34:34.240 --> 34:38.240\nAnd then AG and I have our pants off, like whatever, you know?\n\n34:38.240 --> 34:46.240\nYeah, well he's just trying to make me miss him by being fun\n\n34:46.240 --> 34:48.240\nAG, you want to come up here?\n\n34:48.240 --> 34:50.240\nIt's TV AG!\n\n35:00.240 --> 35:03.240\nWe had our shirts off, not our pants\n\n35:03.240 --> 35:06.240\nDid you have fun? Because I felt like...\n\n35:06.240 --> 35:08.240\nI just started playing video games, I never looked like that\n\n35:08.240 --> 35:11.240\nWe watched the Mulholland Drive\n\n35:11.240 --> 35:16.240\nI said, we're supposed to watch Firewalk with me\n\n35:16.240 --> 35:19.240\nBecause, you know, that's what David Lynch recommends\n\n35:19.240 --> 35:22.240\nIf you're going to watch anything to catch up before you start watching Twin Peaks\n\n35:22.240 --> 35:24.240\nWatch Firewalk with me\n\n35:24.240 --> 35:28.240\nAnd I said to Schrab, should we watch Firewalk with me first?\n\n35:28.240 --> 35:32.240\nAnd he was like, maybe he wouldn't want me saying that\n\n35:32.240 --> 35:34.240\nHe's like, Firewalk with me sucks ass\n\n35:34.240 --> 35:37.240\nAnd I was like, so what does that have to do with anything?\n\n35:37.240 --> 35:42.240\nSo every week should we get together and watch Citizen Kane and then Cheers?\n\n35:42.240 --> 35:46.240\nI thought the point was to watch Twin Peaks\n\n35:46.240 --> 35:50.240\nDavid Lynch said, watch Firewalk with me, fucking do it right, you dick\n\n35:50.240 --> 35:52.240\nI'm just sick of his bullshit right now\n\n35:52.240 --> 35:54.240\nAnd he fucked up\n\n35:54.240 --> 35:57.240\nYou gotta read what he's writing to you\n\n35:57.240 --> 35:59.240\nWhat's he writing?\n\n35:59.240 --> 36:02.240\nDan, read a couple of those\n\n36:02.240 --> 36:04.240\nI really want you to watch Firewalk with me\n\n36:04.240 --> 36:07.240\nIt would be a very good thing to do if you're going to watch\n\n36:07.240 --> 36:13.240\nI mean, Schrab's saying, Schrab tweeted, will you get me tickets to write said Fred?\n\n36:13.240 --> 36:15.240\nHe's rhyming, he's rhyming\n\n36:15.240 --> 36:17.240\nWill you put toast on my bread?\n\n36:17.240 --> 36:19.240\nWill you come visit me on my deathbed?\n\n36:19.240 --> 36:21.240\nThat was probably the first one\n\n36:21.240 --> 36:23.240\nAnd how do you like them apples?\n\n36:23.240 --> 36:30.240\nHe hashtagged how?\n\n36:30.240 --> 36:34.240\nAre you and Rob Schrab friends in real life?\n\n36:34.240 --> 36:38.240\nHe's funny when he's not here, it's amazing\n\n36:38.240 --> 36:42.240\nAt least you know you're getting $5 of Rob's money every month\n\n36:42.240 --> 36:46.240\nWho is Dark Man, he's asking now\n\n36:46.240 --> 36:50.240\nWhy can't you start on time, says Derek, Tuesday sandwich\n\n36:50.240 --> 36:52.240\nWho is Dark Man?\n\n36:52.240 --> 36:55.240\nIt's Liam Neeson, isn't it?\n\n36:55.240 --> 36:59.240\nIt doesn't matter if your face is bandages on it\n\n36:59.240 --> 37:01.240\nRemember that impression?\n\n37:01.240 --> 37:03.240\nOh yeah\n\n37:03.240 --> 37:07.240\nTweetdeck, I'm having a little problem\n\n37:07.240 --> 37:10.240\nIf anybody can recommend an app that functions like Tweetdeck\n\n37:10.240 --> 37:12.240\nWhat's in my pocket, Schrab is asking\n\n37:12.240 --> 37:14.240\nDan, do you think that in role playing with Cody\n\n37:14.240 --> 37:16.240\nYou could get away and it would still be sexy\n\n37:16.240 --> 37:18.240\nIf you were Liam Neeson during the role play?\n\n37:18.240 --> 37:22.240\nYeah, everything's sexy, everything's sexy when you trust someone\n\n37:22.240 --> 37:24.240\nAnd you can go anywhere you want\n\n37:24.240 --> 37:26.240\nCan I give you guys assignments like homework\n\n37:26.240 --> 37:29.240\nWe suggest characters for you guys\n\n37:29.240 --> 37:31.240\nYou come back next week and see if you guys came\n\n37:31.240 --> 37:33.240\nScene studies\n\n37:33.240 --> 37:35.240\nYeah\n\n37:35.240 --> 37:37.240\nI saw somebody had a question about Legs Lavish\n\n37:37.240 --> 37:39.240\nMy YouTube channel that I watch\n\n37:39.240 --> 37:43.240\nWhich is about women for women reviewing hosiery\n\n37:43.240 --> 37:46.240\nWhen I lost it\n\n37:46.240 --> 37:48.240\nFor women you say?\n\n37:48.240 --> 37:50.240\nYeah, you can tell, definitely\n\n37:50.240 --> 37:52.240\nIt's just women doing hosiery reviews\n\n37:52.240 --> 37:55.240\nIt's not pornography\n\n37:55.240 --> 37:57.240\nAlright, I mean\n\n37:57.240 --> 38:00.240\nAre you excited for the mummy remake?\n\n38:00.240 --> 38:05.240\nI know they're trying to start up the dark universe\n\n38:05.240 --> 38:07.240\nOh, is that like universal monsters\n\n38:07.240 --> 38:09.240\nLike they want to be like Marvel\n\n38:09.240 --> 38:11.240\nLike Dracula and the werewolf team\n\n38:11.240 --> 38:14.240\nOh, that reminds me, I gotta check my Mhotep\n\n38:14.240 --> 38:16.240\nCheck my Marvel Academy\n\n38:20.240 --> 38:22.240\nWhat the fuck?\n\n38:22.240 --> 38:27.240\nI go away for five weeks and the show turns to shit\n\n38:27.240 --> 38:29.240\nBrandon, what did you let happen up here?\n\n38:29.240 --> 38:33.240\nI said we should do whatever you were going to do in your basement\n\n38:33.240 --> 38:36.240\nAnd now this is the running order of the show\n\n38:36.240 --> 38:39.240\nWe make loops, we play video games\n\n38:39.240 --> 38:41.240\nDan's doing what he would normally do\n\n38:41.240 --> 38:44.240\nHe's reading tweets, he's playing video games\n\n38:44.240 --> 38:46.240\nI never read the dialogue\n\n38:46.240 --> 38:50.240\nWe're like a month away from you actually just jerking off on stage\n\n38:53.240 --> 38:55.240\nWait, what'd you say?\n\n38:57.240 --> 38:58.240\nI'm sorry\n\n38:58.240 --> 39:01.240\nI've never seen somebody give a look of why wait a month\n\n39:01.240 --> 39:04.240\nOne look, why wait a month?\n\n39:08.240 --> 39:10.240\nAre you sort of a cookie collector?\n\n39:10.240 --> 39:12.240\nWhat do you guys want to do later?\n\n39:14.240 --> 39:16.240\nI guess we lost audio at some point\n\n39:16.240 --> 39:18.240\nWe also lost the show\n\n39:19.240 --> 39:25.240\nNothing happening, it's just a rich 45 year old just playing video games on stage\n\n39:25.240 --> 39:27.240\nOh, I'm so glad you're back\n\n39:27.240 --> 39:30.240\nAnd he doesn't care, he doesn't know that we're here anymore\n\n39:30.240 --> 39:32.240\nHe can either see or hear us\n\n39:32.240 --> 39:35.240\nDon't you think people tweeting questions is part of a show?\n\n39:35.240 --> 39:39.240\nI'm sorry I took a two minute break to check on my Marvel Avengers\n\n39:39.240 --> 39:45.240\ncharacters, like what, I mean it's like a, it's a game, it's like, you know\n\n39:45.240 --> 39:47.240\nWhat about A.G.'s new movie?\n\n39:48.240 --> 39:50.240\nYeah, my movie\n\n39:51.240 --> 39:52.240\nMy movie\n\n39:53.240 --> 39:56.240\nThe star of Guardians of the Galaxy 2\n\n39:56.240 --> 39:57.240\nYeah, my movie\n\n39:58.240 --> 39:59.240\nA.G.\n\n40:00.240 --> 40:01.240\nThank you\n\n40:01.240 --> 40:03.240\nWhat is, what's Finn Dom?\n\n40:04.240 --> 40:07.240\nFinn Dom's where you hire a woman to have all your money\n\n40:07.240 --> 40:14.240\nOh, so is this, is it possible this person is a, well his, his Twitter name is Steven in debt\n\n40:14.240 --> 40:16.240\nYeah, that's his fetish\n\n40:16.240 --> 40:18.240\nDan, I'm worried my fetish is going to ruin my life\n\n40:18.240 --> 40:22.240\nAny thoughts, advice for beating an addiction to Finn Dom and similar fets?\n\n40:22.240 --> 40:25.240\nFinn Dom seems like a stupid fetish\n\n40:25.240 --> 40:28.240\nI mean, but you know that that's a\n\n40:28.240 --> 40:31.240\nThere's a lot of stupid fetishes\n\n40:31.240 --> 40:34.240\nYeah, but what if that made you come?\n\n40:34.240 --> 40:37.240\nWhat if, what if giving someone all your money made you come? That's what he's saying\n\n40:37.240 --> 40:38.240\nI'd be like that's dumb\n\n40:38.240 --> 40:39.240\nHe's saying\n\n40:40.240 --> 40:43.240\nHe obviously knows that and so he's crying out for help\n\n40:43.240 --> 40:46.240\nEven if he's doing a bit, like this, this person exists hypothetically\n\n40:46.240 --> 40:48.240\nRight, no, I think I'd be a lot more\n\n40:48.240 --> 40:50.240\nIf that were my fetish I'd be a lot more productive\n\n40:50.240 --> 40:52.240\nCause you know, you give all your money away\n\n40:52.240 --> 40:53.240\nI gotta get back to work\n\n40:53.240 --> 40:55.240\nYeah, you eventually run out\n\n40:55.240 --> 40:57.240\nI wanna come again, I gotta go out there and make that money\n\n40:57.240 --> 40:58.240\nYeah\n\n40:58.240 --> 41:01.240\nI would suggest to the person with absolutely no judgment at all\n\n41:01.240 --> 41:05.240\nI would say, like, you know, do what you would do\n\n41:05.240 --> 41:08.240\nIf you were locked in a room\n\n41:08.240 --> 41:12.240\nYou know, and you couldn't, you couldn't live\n\n41:12.240 --> 41:15.240\nLike if, you know, like, like quitting smoking, you know\n\n41:15.240 --> 41:18.240\nLike, if you were locked in a room without your cigarettes you wouldn't die\n\n41:18.240 --> 41:20.240\nSo I guess you just gotta figure out a way\n\n41:20.240 --> 41:21.240\nYou have to take an action\n\n41:21.240 --> 41:24.240\nYou're gonna really handcuff yourself to a radiator werewolf style\n\n41:24.240 --> 41:28.240\nAnd you gotta, it's never gonna be the right time to do it\n\n41:28.240 --> 41:31.240\nLike, I got off the elliptical and I'm never gonna get back on\n\n41:31.240 --> 41:33.240\nUntil I just do it at the wrong time\n\n41:33.240 --> 41:39.240\nYou gotta tell those young ladies on your chat window\n\n41:39.240 --> 41:43.240\nNo, you cannot have my money and I refuse to talk about it\n\n41:43.240 --> 41:45.240\nAnd even give it back\n\n41:45.240 --> 41:47.240\nHere's a pitch, we bring your elliptical to the show\n\n41:47.240 --> 41:49.240\nYou do 20 minutes of the show on the elliptical\n\n41:49.240 --> 41:51.240\nOh my god, that's a great idea\n\n41:51.240 --> 41:53.240\nThat's not a great idea\n\n41:53.240 --> 41:54.240\nSpencer doesn't\n\n41:54.240 --> 41:57.240\nYou guys don't understand what it involves to move that elliptical places\n\n41:57.240 --> 41:59.240\nYeah, Spencer's gonna be the one moving that\n\n41:59.240 --> 42:00.240\nYeah\n\n42:00.240 --> 42:02.240\nAlright, well, so anyways\n\n42:02.240 --> 42:05.240\nI'll buy a new elliptical to have here so we can watch it work out\n\n42:05.240 --> 42:07.240\nThere's an idea\n\n42:07.240 --> 42:11.240\nLet's see, I mean, look, I mean, I'm not the one that...\n\n42:11.240 --> 42:13.240\nI'm happy to talk about lots of stuff\n\n42:13.240 --> 42:14.240\nI got some movie recommends\n\n42:14.240 --> 42:16.240\nI don't feel at home in this world anymore\n\n42:16.240 --> 42:18.240\nCheck it out on Netflix\n\n42:18.240 --> 42:22.240\nWhat is this thing, these branches going off of...\n\n42:22.240 --> 42:23.240\nIt's a mind map\n\n42:23.240 --> 42:24.240\nThis app's called iThoughts\n\n42:24.240 --> 42:26.240\nI'm not sold on it right away\n\n42:26.240 --> 42:29.240\nBut also watch sneakers, it's a 90s movie\n\n42:29.240 --> 42:32.240\nIt'll make you feel better\n\n42:32.240 --> 42:34.240\nNo, it won't, it'll make you feel sad\n\n42:34.240 --> 42:36.240\nWell, because it's like, there's no internet yet\n\n42:36.240 --> 42:38.240\nBut it's like about hacking and it's fun\n\n42:38.240 --> 42:40.240\nAnd there's a Russian guy in it that's like\n\n42:40.240 --> 42:42.240\nOh, it's crazy that the Cold War is over\n\n42:42.240 --> 42:44.240\nAnd you just want to kill yourself\n\n42:44.240 --> 42:46.240\nAnd River Phoenix is in it\n\n42:46.240 --> 42:48.240\nSo here's the thing, I was watching it\n\n42:48.240 --> 42:51.240\nI was like, god damn, you know all due respect\n\n42:51.240 --> 42:53.240\nTo everyone in Tinseltown\n\n42:53.240 --> 42:55.240\nI hope this isn't ghoulish\n\n42:55.240 --> 42:59.240\nBut for real, after River Phoenix died\n\n42:59.240 --> 43:02.240\nYou know DiCaprio's agent called DiCaprio\n\n43:02.240 --> 43:04.240\nAnd it was like, River Phoenix died\n\n43:04.240 --> 43:07.240\nAnd DiCaprio was like, ah, bummer\n\n43:07.240 --> 43:09.240\nWhat do you got for me?\n\n43:09.240 --> 43:11.240\nYou know, like...\n\n43:11.240 --> 43:14.240\nSo what do you think, Gilbert Grape?\n\n43:14.240 --> 43:17.240\nIt's like, you know, come on man\n\n43:17.240 --> 43:20.240\nRiver Phoenix dying was good for DiCaprio\n\n43:20.240 --> 43:22.240\nIs my thesis\n\n43:22.240 --> 43:26.240\nDo you think DiCaprio murdered him?\n\n43:26.240 --> 43:28.240\nNo, I wouldn't go that far, I just think\n\n43:28.240 --> 43:31.240\nYou know, it's weird when life puts you sometimes\n\n43:31.240 --> 43:33.240\nIn the position of cheering someone's death\n\n43:33.240 --> 43:35.240\nDid you see the keepers?\n\n43:35.240 --> 43:38.240\nYes, I've been watching the keepers\n\n43:38.240 --> 43:40.240\nIt's a bummer\n\n43:40.240 --> 43:42.240\nNo, I mean, it's insane\n\n43:42.240 --> 43:44.240\nIt's crazy\n\n43:44.240 --> 43:46.240\nSo we've stood up here numerous times\n\n43:46.240 --> 43:48.240\nWe all hate the kids\n\n43:48.240 --> 43:50.240\nWe particularly hate the teenagers\n\n43:50.240 --> 43:52.240\nWe think they're entitled\n\n43:52.240 --> 43:54.240\nWe were...\n\n43:54.240 --> 43:57.240\nDino and I were in the back of a lift\n\n43:57.240 --> 44:00.240\nAnd there was a crossing guard\n\n44:00.240 --> 44:02.240\nThere were kids going across the crosswalk\n\n44:02.240 --> 44:04.240\nAnd then somehow the lift driver\n\n44:04.240 --> 44:06.240\nEnded up...\n\n44:06.240 --> 44:08.240\nBy mistake, like, he ended up\n\n44:08.240 --> 44:10.240\nHis car was blocking the crosswalk\n\n44:10.240 --> 44:12.240\nIt wasn't because he wasn't looking\n\n44:12.240 --> 44:14.240\nAnd plowed into kids\n\n44:14.240 --> 44:16.240\nIt was because of the ebb and flow\n\n44:16.240 --> 44:18.240\nOf crosswalkingness\n\n44:18.240 --> 44:20.240\nHe's stuck at a stop sign\n\n44:20.240 --> 44:22.240\nAnd he's in the middle of the crosswalk\n\n44:22.240 --> 44:24.240\nAnd this 10-year-old kid\n\n44:24.240 --> 44:26.240\nComes up to the backseat window of the lift\n\n44:26.240 --> 44:29.240\nAnd knocks on the window that Dino's at\n\n44:29.240 --> 44:32.240\nAnd just has this adorable smile on his face\n\n44:32.240 --> 44:34.240\nBut he's being a cock\n\n44:34.240 --> 44:36.240\nLike, Dino rolls down\n\n44:36.240 --> 44:38.240\nAnd goes, can I help you?\n\n44:38.240 --> 44:40.240\nHe's like, can I help you?\n\n44:40.240 --> 44:42.240\nWhoa!\n\n44:42.240 --> 44:44.240\nAnd luckily he got Dino and not me\n\n44:44.240 --> 44:46.240\nBecause I'd be in jail right now\n\n44:46.240 --> 44:48.240\nBecause I don't know what I would have said\n\n44:48.240 --> 44:50.240\nI probably would have escalated\n\n44:50.240 --> 44:52.240\nBut Dino was like, it's like\n\n44:52.240 --> 44:54.240\nYou can walk around the car\n\n44:54.240 --> 44:56.240\nI believe in you\n\n44:56.240 --> 44:58.240\nAnd he's like, I shouldn't have to\n\n44:58.240 --> 45:00.240\nAnd he's like, you can do it\n\n45:00.240 --> 45:02.240\nGood boy, good boy\n\n45:02.240 --> 45:04.240\nAnd you hear him in the distance go, don't call me boy\n\n45:04.240 --> 45:06.240\nHe was Indian, by the way\n\n45:06.240 --> 45:08.240\nLike...\n\n45:08.240 --> 45:10.240\nWell, don't bury the lead then\n\n45:10.240 --> 45:12.240\nJust to make sure you know\n\n45:12.240 --> 45:14.240\nFuckin' Indian children, wow\n\n45:14.240 --> 45:16.240\nI'm including that at the end\n\n45:16.240 --> 45:18.240\nBecause Dino said boy\n\n45:18.240 --> 45:20.240\nAnd he said, don't call me boy\n\n45:20.240 --> 45:22.240\nWhich is like\n\n45:22.240 --> 45:24.240\nHis race became important at that point\n\n45:24.240 --> 45:26.240\nIn my opinion\n\n45:26.240 --> 45:28.240\nBecause it's like, wait a minute, what the fuck\n\n45:28.240 --> 45:30.240\nShit head, fucking shit head\n\n45:30.240 --> 45:32.240\nAnyways, so that's how we feel about kids\n\n45:32.240 --> 45:34.240\nWe don't like them, we all agree, bad batch\n\n45:34.240 --> 45:36.240\nNo way, but we like\n\n45:36.240 --> 45:38.240\nWe like those kids though\n\n45:38.240 --> 45:40.240\nBecause we grow up to be those kids\n\n45:40.240 --> 45:42.240\nLike, that little smart mouth motherfucker\n\n45:42.240 --> 45:44.240\nWas great\n\n45:44.240 --> 45:46.240\nLike he had a running bit already on the street\n\n45:46.240 --> 45:48.240\nThat he was willing to fuck with adults on\n\n45:48.240 --> 45:50.240\nLike he's a future Dan Harmon\n\n45:50.240 --> 45:52.240\nWell, I\n\n45:52.240 --> 45:54.240\nI hope so\n\n45:54.240 --> 45:56.240\nBut I have a feeling that he's a future Donald Trump\n\n45:56.240 --> 45:58.240\nBecause he's like, oh\n\n45:58.240 --> 46:00.240\nA system exists by which I can just yell at people\n\n46:00.240 --> 46:02.240\nIt's illegal to hit me\n\n46:02.240 --> 46:04.240\nI think I'll just wag my dick around\n\n46:04.240 --> 46:06.240\nBling, bling, bling\n\n46:06.240 --> 46:08.240\nLike, but here's the thing\n\n46:08.240 --> 46:10.240\nThis was all a downbeat to my\n\n46:10.240 --> 46:12.240\nLifting about this, we all shake our canes\n\n46:12.240 --> 46:14.240\nThese kids, they suck, oh, they're so fucking shitty\n\n46:14.240 --> 46:16.240\nAnd they're, you know, they know it's illegal\n\n46:16.240 --> 46:18.240\nTo hit them now, and they're just taking advantage of it\n\n46:18.240 --> 46:20.240\nIf you watch\n\n46:20.240 --> 46:22.240\nThe Keepers on Netflix, which takes, you know\n\n46:22.240 --> 46:24.240\nIt's like, this nun\n\n46:24.240 --> 46:26.240\nDisappears, they find her body, and then it all\n\n46:26.240 --> 46:28.240\nLike straights down in court, this horribleness\n\n46:28.240 --> 46:30.240\nIs happening within the Catholic high school\n\n46:30.240 --> 46:32.240\nAnd it's just\n\n46:32.240 --> 46:34.240\nLike episode after episode\n\n46:34.240 --> 46:36.240\nStory after story of you can't\n\n46:36.240 --> 46:38.240\nBelieve, it sounds like a parallel dimension\n\n46:38.240 --> 46:40.240\nThe shit that people were getting away\n\n46:40.240 --> 46:42.240\nWith abusing these kids\n\n46:42.240 --> 46:44.240\nThese kids are pubescent girls\n\n46:44.240 --> 46:46.240\nIn an all girls Catholic school\n\n46:46.240 --> 46:48.240\nAnd I was uplifted\n\n46:48.240 --> 46:50.240\nAnd I was talking to somebody about this\n\n46:50.240 --> 46:52.240\nThe other day, because they were griping about today's kids\n\n46:52.240 --> 46:54.240\nYou know, like, oh\n\n46:54.240 --> 46:56.240\nAnd I was like, yeah, but\n\n46:56.240 --> 46:58.240\nIf these kids, like\n\n46:58.240 --> 47:00.240\nThat Keepers shit, it's impossible\n\n47:00.240 --> 47:02.240\nNow, like you can't\n\n47:04.240 --> 47:06.240\nToday's 13-year-old\n\n47:06.240 --> 47:08.240\nIs gonna go into a priest's office\n\n47:08.240 --> 47:10.240\nAnd\n\n47:10.240 --> 47:12.240\nBelieve they should just drink a soda\n\n47:12.240 --> 47:14.240\nAnd talk about what a slut they are\n\n47:14.240 --> 47:16.240\nAnd not think it's gonna\n\n47:16.240 --> 47:18.240\nYou know, they're gonna, that entitlement\n\n47:18.240 --> 47:20.240\nThat we're complaining about and stuff\n\n47:20.240 --> 47:22.240\nIt's like, there's a, like\n\n47:22.240 --> 47:24.240\nWhere did the obedience get us?\n\n47:24.240 --> 47:26.240\nWhere did the respect for elders\n\n47:26.240 --> 47:28.240\nLike, it's always\n\n47:28.240 --> 47:30.240\nSix to one-and-a-half a dozen\n\n47:30.240 --> 47:32.240\nLike, when you watch The Keepers\n\n47:32.240 --> 47:34.240\nYou just wish Ariana Grande fans\n\n47:34.240 --> 47:36.240\nThe office and go like, I'm entitled\n\n47:36.240 --> 47:38.240\nBecause it would be the end of everything\n\n47:38.240 --> 47:40.240\nAnd instead, this thing goes on and on\n\n47:40.240 --> 47:42.240\nFor so long that you're just watching\n\n47:42.240 --> 47:44.240\nOld people watch\n\n47:44.240 --> 47:46.240\nThe snow fall over the footprints of their abuse\n\n47:46.240 --> 47:48.240\nThat took, that was so severe\n\n47:48.240 --> 47:50.240\nIt took them their entire life\n\n47:50.240 --> 47:52.240\nBefore they could even remember it\n\n47:52.240 --> 47:54.240\nThen talk about it, then\n\n47:54.240 --> 47:56.240\nFind each other on Facebook\n\n47:56.240 --> 47:58.240\nThen be told by everyone\n\n47:58.240 --> 48:00.240\nGo fuck yourself, you took too long to remember it\n\n48:00.240 --> 48:02.240\nAnyways, so the good old days\n\n48:02.240 --> 48:04.240\nWeren't that good\n\n48:04.240 --> 48:06.240\nIt is, by the way, a tenet of fascism\n\n48:06.240 --> 48:08.240\nFrom everybody that studies it\n\n48:08.240 --> 48:10.240\nThese illusions to a mysterious\n\n48:10.240 --> 48:12.240\nAmorphous, unsighted\n\n48:12.240 --> 48:14.240\nGolden age\n\n48:14.240 --> 48:16.240\nMake America great again\n\n48:16.240 --> 48:18.240\nEverything was great at some point\n\n48:18.240 --> 48:20.240\nYou'll never be able to get out of a fascist\n\n48:20.240 --> 48:22.240\nThe actual documentation\n\n48:22.240 --> 48:24.240\nOf when it was so fucking great\n\n48:24.240 --> 48:26.240\nThey love to talk about\n\n48:26.240 --> 48:28.240\nLike, it's like comic book golden age\n\n48:28.240 --> 48:30.240\nOr something, like, oh, remember when things\n\n48:30.240 --> 48:32.240\nRemember when you were six\n\n48:32.240 --> 48:34.240\nAnd you thought fucking Santa was real\n\n48:34.240 --> 48:36.240\nThat's what you're talking about\n\n48:36.240 --> 48:38.240\nYou want to get back to when you were six\n\n48:38.240 --> 48:40.240\nFucking bloated windbag\n\n48:40.240 --> 48:42.240\nYou shitty murderous, horrible\n\n48:42.240 --> 48:44.240\nI didn't\n\n48:44.240 --> 48:46.240\nYeah\n\n48:46.240 --> 48:48.240\nAnd by the way, politically\n\n48:48.240 --> 48:50.240\nLet's check in on my politics\n\n48:50.240 -->

49:52.240\nYou dropped that premise like after episode 3\n\n49:52.240 --> 49:54.240\nI think\n\n49:54.240 --> 49:56.240\nChurch and I went to the March for Truth\n\n49:56.240 --> 49:58.240\nIn LA yesterday\n\n49:58.240 --> 50:00.240\nAnd we were leaving the march\n\n50:00.240 --> 50:02.240\nAnd there's always like 6 or 8\n\n50:02.240 --> 50:04.240\nPro-Trump people on a corner\n\n50:04.240 --> 50:06.240\nUsually completely surrounded by police\n\n50:06.240 --> 50:08.240\nWhere you're not even allowed to get close to them\n\n50:08.240 --> 50:10.240\nBecause they're afraid of what might happen\n\n50:10.240 --> 50:12.240\nBut yesterday, for some reason\n\n50:12.240 --> 50:14.240\nYou could walk up to them\n\n50:14.240 --> 50:16.240\nThey had like a microphone and a speaker\n\n50:16.240 --> 50:18.240\nAnd it was a guy dressed like\n\n50:18.240 --> 50:20.240\nHe had like\n\n50:20.240 --> 50:22.240\nThe old nickerbagger plus 4\n\n50:22.240 --> 50:24.240\nWait, so he wanted you to connect\n\n50:24.240 --> 50:26.240\nThose dots like the American dream\n\n50:26.240 --> 50:28.240\nHe had a whole beat up tricorn hat\n\n50:28.240 --> 50:30.240\nAnd he looked like homeless\n\n50:30.240 --> 50:32.240\nBen Franklin\n\n50:32.240 --> 50:34.240\nAnd he was like, everyone wants to talk\n\n50:34.240 --> 50:36.240\nYou can come over and talk to us\n\n50:36.240 --> 50:38.240\nA penny stolen is a penny stolen\n\n50:42.240 --> 50:44.240\nHomeless Ben Franklin jokes\n\n50:44.240 --> 50:46.240\nIs that what he was going?\n\n50:46.240 --> 50:48.240\nBut there was Make America Great Again banners\n\n50:48.240 --> 50:50.240\nAnd there was a lot of, you know\n\n50:50.240 --> 50:52.240\nWhy would I have a key? I don't have a house\n\n50:52.240 --> 50:54.240\nIf I tried to discover\n\n51:00.240 --> 51:02.240\nBut I know we're derailing you\n\n51:02.240 --> 51:04.240\nAre you sure this guy was conservative?\n\n51:04.240 --> 51:06.240\nOh yeah, he was\n\n51:06.240 --> 51:08.240\nBut he was being pretty cool because he was engaging\n\n51:08.240 --> 51:10.240\nPeople were like, if you want to come up here\n\n51:10.240 --> 51:12.240\nI'll give you the microphone, we can have a discussion\n\n51:12.240 --> 51:14.240\nIt turns out mostly\n\n51:14.240 --> 51:16.240\nThey shout you down about what you think\n\n51:16.240 --> 51:18.240\nBecause they're surrounded by\n\n51:18.240 --> 51:20.240\nLocker up and\n\n51:20.240 --> 51:22.240\nHillary is evil\n\n51:22.240 --> 51:24.240\nKind of posters, they're still on that thing\n\n51:24.240 --> 51:26.240\nBut Church at the center\n\n51:26.240 --> 51:28.240\nThis is amazing, I should probably talk about it\n\n51:28.240 --> 51:30.240\nLike she wants to, but she had this conversation\n\n51:30.240 --> 51:32.240\nWith this woman who had an American Indian\n\n51:32.240 --> 51:34.240\nDrum\n\n51:34.240 --> 51:36.240\nAnd she had a Trump-Pence 2020\n\n51:36.240 --> 51:38.240\nShirt and hat on\n\n51:38.240 --> 51:40.240\nBut she didn't vote for Trump\n\n51:40.240 --> 51:42.240\nBut she thinks that it was better\n\n51:42.240 --> 51:44.240\nHaving this hour-long conversation\n\n51:44.240 --> 51:46.240\nWith her, she came away with\n\n51:46.240 --> 51:48.240\nIt was really uplifting\n\n51:48.240 --> 51:50.240\nBut surrounded by people that can actually talk\n\n51:50.240 --> 51:52.240\nAnd one of the upshots of it\n\n51:52.240 --> 51:54.240\nWas the woman said, you know what, this conversation\n\n51:54.240 --> 51:56.240\nMakes me feel like I should call up some of my friends\n\n51:56.240 --> 51:58.240\nThat I don't talk to anymore\n\n51:58.240 --> 52:00.240\nBecause I don't feel like I can\n\n52:00.240 --> 52:02.240\nBecause we're so different, the gulf between what I believe\n\n52:02.240 --> 52:04.240\nAnd what you believe is so unbridgeable\n\n52:04.240 --> 52:06.240\nBut there was another guy pacing around\n\n52:06.240 --> 52:08.240\nAnd he had goggles on\n\n52:08.240 --> 52:10.240\nAnd an American flag bandana\n\n52:10.240 --> 52:12.240\nAnd a helmet\n\n52:12.240 --> 52:14.240\nAnd like military, like\n\n52:14.240 --> 52:16.240\nFlak jacket kind of stuff on and carrying a flag\n\n52:16.240 --> 52:18.240\nAnd just pacing around mad-dogging everybody\n\n52:18.240 --> 52:20.240\nClearly looking for a fight\n\n52:20.240 --> 52:22.240\nSo like you have people that really do want to have a discussion\n\n52:22.240 --> 52:24.240\nSurrounded by people that are clearly cruising\n\n52:24.240 --> 52:26.240\nFor a bruising\n\n52:26.240 --> 52:28.240\nWith a guy in Portland, like it's just\n\n52:28.240 --> 52:30.240\nHe was just this, I mean\n\n52:30.240 --> 52:32.240\nAnd there was this one kid, like college-age looking dude\n\n52:32.240 --> 52:34.240\nAnd he had a big sign that said\n\n52:34.240 --> 52:36.240\nStop the hate, let's debate\n\n52:36.240 --> 52:38.240\nAnd I walked by him and said, hey, you want to just talk?\n\n52:38.240 --> 52:40.240\nI'm like, not really, I mean\n\n52:40.240 --> 52:42.240\nIt's hot out, so I want to go have lunch\n\n52:42.240 --> 52:44.240\nYou know?\n\n52:44.240 --> 52:46.240\nAnd I'm pretty sure\n\n52:46.240 --> 52:48.240\nWe're not going to convince each other of anything\n\n52:48.240 --> 52:50.240\nAnd he was like, no, I just feel like\n\n52:50.240 --> 52:52.240\nIt shouldn't be about shouting, it should be a conversation\n\n52:52.240 --> 52:54.240\nWe should be able to talk about the difference\n\n52:54.240 --> 52:56.240\nI totally agree with that\n\n52:56.240 --> 52:58.240\nI appreciate you guys being out here\n\n52:58.240 --> 53:00.240\nAnd doing that, like hooray for you\n\n53:00.240 --> 53:02.240\nThen I saw him a little later on\n\n53:02.240 --> 53:04.240\nAnd he held his sign up\n\n53:04.240 --> 53:06.240\nAnd underneath his stop the hate, let's debate sign\n\n53:06.240 --> 53:08.240\nI will post this photo because he's a douchebag\n\n53:10.240 --> 53:12.240\nWhen he lifted his thing up\n\n53:12.240 --> 53:14.240\nHis shirt said, Hillary sucks\n\n53:14.240 --> 53:16.240\nNot like Monica though, or something like that\n\n53:16.240 --> 53:18.240\nI'm like, oh really?\n\n53:18.240 --> 53:20.240\nSo I went up and said, hey, can I get a picture of you?\n\n53:20.240 --> 53:22.240\nAnd he goes, yeah, and he holds his sign up\n\n53:22.240 --> 53:24.240\nI wanted to get a picture of your awesome misogyny shirt\n\n53:24.240 --> 53:26.240\nAnd he goes, what?

53:42.240\nIs so sensitive to my needs\n\n53:42.240 --> 53:44.240\nOh, good to show you true colors\n\n53:44.240 --> 53:46.240\nI'm so fucking sick of that\n\n53:46.240 --> 53:48.240\nThese people are not going to reward\n\n53:48.240 --> 53:50.240\nOur fucking, like, we're the trolls\n\n53:50.240 --> 53:52.240\nNow we should be angry\n\n53:52.240 --> 53:54.240\nAnd they should go fuck themselves\n\n53:54.240 --> 53:56.240\nI hate that they switch gears\n\n53:56.240 --> 53:58.240\nTo this, like, they're trolling us\n\n53:58.240 --> 54:00.240\nThey don't really want to\n\n54:00.240 --> 54:02.240\nI like that there was a gang\n\n54:02.240 --> 54:04.240\nOf people out there going, hey, let's debate\n\n54:04.240 --> 54:06.240\nBecause what I think\n\n54:06.240 --> 54:08.240\nThat means is that they're on the fucking ropes\n\n54:08.240 --> 54:10.240\nPsychologically, just them\n\n54:10.240 --> 54:12.240\nThat they've run out of ways\n\n54:12.240 --> 54:14.240\nTo feel like they're part of a group\n\n54:14.240 --> 54:16.240\nAnd now they're so lonely\n\n54:16.240 --> 54:18.240\nAnd people have gotten so good\n\n54:18.240 --> 54:20.240\nAt walking by them that they're like\n\n54:20.240 --> 54:22.240\nWhat about discourse?\n\n54:22.240 --> 54:24.240\nHa, ha, ha, ha\n\n54:24.240 --> 54:26.240\nOkay\n\n54:26.240 --> 54:28.240\nYou guys always want to talk, right?\n\n54:28.240 --> 54:30.240\nIntellectual, let's have a conversation\n\n54:30.240 --> 54:32.240\nUm, okay\n\n54:32.240 --> 54:34.240\nWhat are you saying?\n\n54:34.240 --> 54:36.240\nRETURN\n\n54:36.240 --> 54:38.240\nThese people are dumb\n\n54:38.240 --> 54:40.240\nThey're dumb\n\n54:40.240 --> 54:42.240\nAnd you know they're dumb when they speak\n\n54:42.240 --> 54:44.240\nBecause they don't know how to put thoughts together\n\n54:44.240 --> 54:46.240\nAnd when you say things to them\n\n54:46.240 --> 54:48.240\nLike, that sounds like\n\n54:48.240 --> 54:50.240\nYou don't know that America\n\n54:50.240 --> 54:52.240\nIsn't two million years old\n\n54:52.240 --> 54:54.240\nUm, they say\n\n54:54.240 --> 54:56.240\nSee, it's that kind of attitude\n\n54:56.240 --> 54:58.240\nThat's seen its day\n\n54:58.240 --> 55:00.240\nYou know, like it's always\n\n55:00.240 --> 55:02.240\nIt's an anti-intellectual revolution\n\n55:02.240 --> 55:04.240\nAnd so there is no conversation\n\n55:04.240 --> 55:06.240\nThey're\n\n55:06.240 --> 55:08.240\nUgly, mean, nasty,\n\n55:08.240 --> 55:10.240\nBrutish, thuggish, selfish\n\n55:10.240 --> 55:12.240\nI got a boo-boo\n\n55:12.240 --> 55:14.240\nIt's everyone else's problem people\n\n55:14.240 --> 55:16.240\nI got a fucking boo-boo, motherfucker\n\n55:16.240 --> 55:18.240\nI pay taxes\n\n55:18.240 --> 55:20.240\nI pay everyone's taxes\n\n55:20.240 --> 55:22.240\nI'm a one percenter\n\n55:22.240 --> 55:24.240\nIt's hard for me\n\n55:24.240 --> 55:26.240\nGet out the world's biggest\n\n55:26.240 --> 55:28.240\nViolin for me\n\n55:28.240 --> 55:30.240\nYou're paying for it\n\n55:30.240 --> 55:32.240\nYour tax dollars go to tiny\n\n55:32.240 --> 55:34.240\nViolins all over the world\n\n55:34.240 --> 55:36.240\nIt's just like, Louis C.K. had this thing\n\n55:36.240 --> 55:38.240\nWhere he was like, by the way, voting\n\n55:38.240 --> 55:40.240\nVoting is like, it's not, you're not supposed to wait\n\n55:40.240 --> 55:42.240\nFor the candidate that's like\n\n55:42.240 --> 55:44.240\nYou know, like, oh\n\n55:44.240 --> 55:46.240\nThat's what we're suffering from\n\n55:46.240 --> 55:48.240\nI was reading this thing by Noam Chomsky\n\n55:48.240 --> 55:50.240\nBut most things by Chomsky I probably didn't understand it\n\n55:50.240 --> 55:52.240\nI have to read it five more times\n\n55:52.240 --> 55:54.240\nBut we're talking about this thing\n\n55:54.240 --> 55:56.240\nIt's this bag of potatoes principle\n\n55:56.240 --> 55:58.240\nWhere\n\n55:58.240 --> 56:00.240\nIndividualism\n\n56:00.240 --> 56:02.240\nHyperbole where it's like\n\n56:02.240 --> 56:04.240\nYou kind of count on the impoverished\n\n56:04.240 --> 56:06.240\nYou play up to everything that divides them\n\n56:06.240 --> 56:08.240\nEven down to the individual\n\n56:08.240 --> 56:10.240\nNot just racially, not just religiously\n\n56:10.240 --> 56:12.240\nAnd gender and all that stuff\n\n56:12.240 --> 56:14.240\nBut also, you kind of encourage this sort of like\n\n56:14.240 --> 56:16.240\nOh, democracy means that you as an individual\n\n56:16.240 --> 56:18.240\nShould be able to put your feet up\n\n56:18.240 --> 56:20.240\nAnd eat potato chips, and if anything gets in your way\n\n56:20.240 --> 56:22.240\nYou should be able to complain about it\n\n56:22.240 --> 56:24.240\nAnd that's a weapon that conservatives\n\n56:24.240 --> 56:26.240\nUse\n\n56:26.240 --> 56:28.240\nTo make stupid people go\n\n56:28.240 --> 56:30.240\nWait, oh, the air conditioning\n\n56:30.240 --> 56:32.240\nChanged a little bit\n\n56:32.240 --> 56:34.240\nIt's 9-11\n\n56:34.240 --> 56:36.240\nIt's 9-11\n\n56:40.240 --> 56:42.240\nYeah, it was good not to cut off there\n\n56:42.240 --> 56:44.240\nIt's 9-11, which is where\n\n56:44.240 --> 56:46.240\nWe've decided to take an act break in our show\n\n56:46.240 --> 56:48.240\nYeah, we're going to use that now as an organic time\n\n56:48.240 --> 56:50.240\nTo stop and take an act break\n\n56:50.240 --> 56:52.240\nAnd announce the fact\n\n56:52.240 --> 56:54.240\nWe are now officially going to start\n\n56:54.240 --> 56:56.240\nOur D&D campaign\n\n56:56.240 --> 56:58.240\nOur Pathfinder campaign\n\n57:02.240 --> 57:04.240\nBut\n\n57:04.240 --> 57:06.240\nYou kind of did that in the wrong order\n\n57:06.240 --> 57:08.240\nThe 9-11 is a reminder\n\n57:08.240 --> 57:10.240\nThat we go to a word from our sponsor\n\n57:10.240 --> 57:12.240\nFor people who listen to the podcast for free\n\n57:12.240 --> 57:14.240\nDo you guys know what Fulton and Rourke is?\n\n57:14.240 --> 57:16.240\nA full mitt Rourke?\n\n57:16.240 --> 57:18.240\nFulton and Rourke is a premier\n\n57:18.240 --> 57:20.240\nMen's\n\n57:20.240 --> 57:22.240\nToiletry service\n\n57:22.240 --> 57:24.240\nThat's specialized in wax based cologne\n\n57:24.240 --> 57:26.240\nAnd\n\n57:26.240 --> 57:28.240\nBody wash for men\n\n57:28.240 --> 57:30.240\nWell, now you're confusing people, because what we're going to do is take an act break\n\n57:30.240 --> 57:32.240\nAnd\n\n57:34.240 --> 57:36.240\nWhat we're going to do is take an act break\n\n57:36.240 --> 57:38.240\nThat the feral audio people could identify\n\n57:38.240 --> 57:40.240\nWhere they would put the volume down and play one of those mid-roll ads\n\n57:40.240 --> 57:42.240\nOh, I thought you were telling the audience the ads\n\n57:44.240 --> 57:46.240\nThat was a special treat\n\n57:46.240 --> 57:48.240\nIt's 9-12 now\n\n57:48.240 --> 57:50.240\nDid that ship sail?\n\n57:50.240 --> 57:52.240\nSo here's what we're going to do\n\n57:52.240 --> 57:54.240\nIt's 9-11\n\n57:54.240 --> 57:56.240\nSo we're going to take a break here\n\n57:56.240 --> 57:58.240\nDuring which the people who listen to the podcast\n\n57:58.240 --> 58:00.240\nFor free are going to listen\n\n58:00.240 --> 58:02.240\nTo a pre-rolled ad\n\n58:02.240 --> 58:04.240\nDuring that ad\n\n58:04.240 --> 58:06.240\nThat you're listening to at home for free\n\n58:06.240 --> 58:08.240\nOr on your subway or where you're cutting your carrots\n\n58:08.240 --> 58:10.240\nIn the front lawn\n\n58:10.240 --> 58:12.240\nThe people that are here live\n\n58:12.240 --> 58:14.240\nAnd the people that pay $5 a month\n\n58:14.240 --> 58:16.240\nAre going to experience an exclusive\n\n58:16.240 --> 58:18.240\nHarmontown experience\n\n58:18.240 --> 58:20.240\nIt's called a solid gold blow job machine\n\n58:26.240 --> 58:28.240\nSo right now\n\n58:28.240 --> 58:30.240\nAlready\n\n58:30.240 --> 58:32.240\nThe people that can hear the sound of my voice right now\n\n58:32.240 --> 58:34.240\nIf you didn't pay for this\n\n58:34.240 --> 58:36.240\nThere's been a mistake\n\n58:38.240 --> 58:40.240\nBecause you're now in the ad free zone\n\n58:40.240 --> 58:42.240\nThe exclusive\n\n58:42.240 --> 58:44.240\nExclusive\n\n58:44.240 --> 58:46.240\nSo roomy\n\n58:46.240 --> 58:48.240\nLuxurious\n\n58:48.240 --> 58:50.240\nIt's so comfortable\n\n58:50.240 --> 58:52.240\nIt's like wearing me undies\n\n58:52.240 --> 58:54.240\nWe should monetize the ad free zone\n\n58:54.240 --> 58:56.240\nIf it becomes\n\n58:56.240 --> 58:58.240\nBut also it's a great time to show pictures\n\n58:58.240 --> 59:00.240\nOr play some songs\n\n59:00.240 --> 59:10.240\nYeah, write a song for us, Dan.\n\n59:10.240 --> 59:12.240\nRight?\n\n59:12.240 --> 59:14.240\nSee this one still needs to go\n\n59:22.240 --> 59:26.240\nWhat if you slow it down?\n\n59:26.240 --> 59:28.240\nLike\n\n59:28.240 --> 59:30.240\nConsiderably\n\n59:36.240 --> 59:38.240\nI'm just talking about the whole music making process\n\n59:38.240 --> 59:40.240\nAre you about to do a slow jam for us?\n\n59:42.240 --> 59:44.240\nJust imagine those podcast fuckers\n\n59:44.240 --> 59:46.240\nMissing out on this\n\n59:46.240 --> 59:48.240\nAre we in the ad free zone or are we back?\n\n59:48.240 --> 59:50.240\nI hope so\n\n59:50.240 --> 59:52.240\nIt's nice, right?\n\n59:52.240 --> 59:54.240\nIt's a little more manageable\n\n59:54.240 --> 59:56.240\nYeah\n\n59:56.240 --> 59:58.240\nI don't know\n\n59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.240\nDan doesn't like it\n\n01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.240\nSounds like graduation music\n\n01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.240\nYeah\n\n01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.240\nThat vitamin C song\n\n01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.240\nJeff Bryan Davis\n\n01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.240\nDid you guys\n\n01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.240\nI don't want to sound\n\n01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.240\nDefensive or tyrannical\n\n01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.240\nBut did you guys\n\n01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.240\nHave been complaining the whole time\n\n01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.240\nAbout how the show's going\n\n01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.240\nAnd what's happening in the show\n\n01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.240\nHave anything for the people that could be special?\n\n01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.240\nLike did you want to share anything\n\n01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.240\nWith anybody?\n\n01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.240\nLike what did you do\n\n01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.240\nWhere were you, Jeff?\n\n01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.240\nI was doing\n\n01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.240\nI traveled all over the country\n\n01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.240\nWith Ryan Stiles, Greg Proops, Jill Murray, and Bob Durkatch\n\n01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.240\nWe did comedy for people\n\n01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.240\nIt was very fun, whose life anyways\n\n01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.240\nIt's a good show\n\n01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.240\nI mean, sarcastically, good thing\n\n01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.240\nNobody's missing that\n\n01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.240\nYeah, you know, I didn't go anywhere last week at all\n\n01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.240\nYes, you did, you went to some sort of Pathfinder\n\n01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.240\nAffair\n\n01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.240\nNo, no, I was hunting whales\n\n01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.240\nDid you catch any?\n\n01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.240\nYeah, I murdered three\n\n01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.240\nAnd as the life\n\n01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.240\nWas being squeezed out of their\n\n01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.240\nSupple necks, I was just imagining\n\n01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.240\nThem as all the fans\n\n01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.240\nShe just listened to the podcast\n\n01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.240\nJust murdering the fans\n\n01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.240\nI didn't even know whales had necks\n\n01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.240\nYeah, oh, they do\n\n01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.240\nThey're hard to strangle but\n\n01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.240\nIt's the hardest way to kill a whale\n\n01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.240\nLike you have to hate whales so much\n\n01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.240\nWell, we were doing it for sport, of course\n\n01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.240\nYeah, and it's easy to hate whales\n\n01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.240\nWhen you think of them as your fans\n\n01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.240\nYou could kill a whale with a harpoon\n\n01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.240\nOr with a bomb, but you have to\n\n01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.240\nFucking hate whales to get in the water\n\n01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.240\nWith them and just try to strangle them\n\n01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.240\nThen we got raided by Interpol\n\n01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.240\nBecause of all this\n\n01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.240\nConflict ivory that we had on board\n\n01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.240\nIt was a real situation\n\n01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.240\nYeah, you're giving poachers a bad name\n\n01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.240\nYou're one of those bad poachers\n\n01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.240\nYeah, I talked our way out of it\n\n01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.240\nI floated the head Interpol guy\n\n01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.240\nA dress made of puppies\n\n01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.240\nYes!\n\n01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.240\nAnd he led me off with a warning\n\n01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.240\nYes, that deserves\n\n01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.240\nThat's all the things we referenced\n\n01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.240\nAnd we're back\n\n01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.240\nCome on\n\n01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.240\nThat is some insane recall\n\n01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.240\nRight there, well done\n\n01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.240\nThat was amazing\n\n01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.240\nI wish people could hear\n\n01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.240\nYou guys missed something\n\n01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.240\nIf you don't pay five bucks a month\n\n01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.240\nThere's callbacks to other shows that happen\n\n01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.240\nLet's all put our pants back on\n\n01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.240\nAnd get back to the show\n\n01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.240\nThat was so chilling\n\n01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.240\nThis has been a long delay\n\n01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.240\nUnless getting into the\n\n01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.240\nD&D thing\n\n01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.240\nSo we're not going to\n\n01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.240\nDo actual gameplay this episode\n\n01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.240\nThat's going to be the next episode\n\n01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.240\nHold on\n\n01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.240\nOne thing we're going to establish\n\n01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.240\nAbout the D&D thing is\n\n01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.240\nWe're going to do it earlier in the show\n\n01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.240\nAbout halfway through\n\n01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.240\nSo we're hopefully a little more sober\n\n01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.240\nWe're going to keep it consistent\n\n01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.240\nWe're looking at how to\n\n01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.240\nSpiral out of control\n\n01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.240\nWe're just going to have\n\n01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.240\nPeople that are always\n\n01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.240\nAble to do the show\n\n01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.240\nDoing the characters\n\n01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.240\nWe're not going to start doing the rotating guests\n\n01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.240\nAnd Spencer's going to\n\n01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.240\nAlways call the shots\n\n01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.240\nWe have to respect his authority\n\n01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.240\nAs Dungeon Master\n\n01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.240\nBoth in terms of\n\n01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.240\nOut of game\n\n01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.240\nAnd in game\n\n01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.240\nSo that's why\n\n01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.240\nI now hand it over to you\n\n01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.240\nTo explain what we're doing\n\n01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.240\nThis week\n\n01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.240\nYou should have played that graduation music\n\n01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.240\nWe're gathered here today\n\n01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.240\nSo we have your characters\n\n01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.240\nI have your character's sheets\n\n01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.240\nI thought we should talk about your backgrounds\n\n01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.240\nAnd come up with your shared backstory\n\n01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.240\nAs kind of a fun exercise\n\n01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.240\nSo that when we start\n\n01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.240\nYou kind of have some sense\n\n01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.240\nOf your history together\n\n01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.240\nDoes that make sense?\n\n01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.240\nWhat is your character's racing class?\n\n01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.240\nIt's a great question\n\n01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.240\nIt's like a quiz\n\n01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.240\nI have to know it now\n\n01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.240\nYou haven't thought about your character?\n\n01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.240\nI haven't thought about this in a while\n\n01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.240\nWe kept pushing it off\n\n01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.240\nMy character together\n\n01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.240\nI know what my spells are\n\n01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.240\nYou're very proactive\n\n01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.240\nI'm a human cleric, you dick\n\n01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.240\nI did forget\n\n01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.240\nWhat's your character's name?\n\n01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.240\nIs that blank so far?\n\n01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.240\nNo, that's part of what we gotta come up with\n\n01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.240\nOkay\n\n01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.240\nI'm gonna let that sit\n\n01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.240\nCan I see my sheet\n\n01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.240\nOr is there anything I should...\n\n01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.240\nNo, there's nothing\n\n01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.240\nThis is what we're trying to figure out\n\n01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.240\nI showed you guys these earlier\n\n01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.240\nWhen we weren't on stage\n\n01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.240\nBut you seemed busy\n\n01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.240\nShould we get Steve?\n\n01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.240\nOh yeah, because we're gonna do...\n\n01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.240\nNot Steve A.G.\n\n01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.240\nWe gotta bring Levy up\n\n01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.240\nLevy's sitting down there on the floor\n\n01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.240\nSteve Levy\n\n01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.240\nYou're gonna love it at Levy\n\n01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.240\nMore like a rivey\n\n01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.240\nMan\n\n01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.240\nFinally, more dudes on the stage\n\n01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.240\nSo here's the thing about that\n\n01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.240\nThat is just...\n\n01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.240\nWe're gonna have to just take...\n\n01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.240\nYeah, we're gonna have to just take that bullet\n\n01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.240\nAnd I'm not gonna be one of these guys that says\n\n01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.240\nHey, you got a hundred million dollar movie\n\n01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.240\nTake it easy, equality achieved\n\n01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.240\nHowever, I will say\n\n01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.240\nThat because\n\n01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.240\nWe wanna be able to have consistency\n\n01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.240\nWe...\n\n01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.240\nIt's like...\n\n01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.240\nFor the D&D it is gonna be...\n\n01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.240\nI had a wife\n\n01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.240\nAnd I lost her\n\n01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.240\nBecause of the D&D\n\n01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.240\nYeah\n\n01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.240\nLike\n\n01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.240\nWe'll continue to...\n\n01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.240\nAnd plus, I looked into it\n\n01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.240\nIt turns out girls are actually bad at D&D\n\n01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.240\nOh no\n\n01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.240\nI just...\n\n01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.240\nI looked it up, I saw it online\n\n01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.240\nYou got to send your angry letters\n\n01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.240\nTo the show\n\n01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.240\nThe show\n\n01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.240\nWe're not gonna like circulate\n\n01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.240\nThrough special guests\n\n01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.240\nWe're brought to you by Gold Bond Powder\n\n01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.240\nWe're not gonna circulate through special guests\n\n01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.240\nWhich means that if we're starting\n\n01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.240\nWith a sausage party\n\n01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.240\nIt's gonna be a consistent sausage party\n\n01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.240\nEvery time we play D&D\n\n01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.240\nThe show is largely sausage party\n\n01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.240\nBut can women not join the game\n\n01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.240\nIf they've already played it?\n\n01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.240\nDo the cast stay together from birth?\n\n01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.240\nI...\n\n01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.240\nI...\n\n01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.240\nNo\n\n01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.240\nWe're gonna...\n\n01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.240\nBroke Dan Harmon\n\n01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.240\nThe game that we're gonna play\n\n01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.240\nWelcome back, Jeff\n\n01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.240\nOur D&D campaign started to fall apart\n\n01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.240\nBecause it started to become...\n\n01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.240\nYeah, we would have Curtis Armstrong\n\n01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.240\nTwo out of ten times\n\n01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.240\nCamel, it was all...\n\n01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.240\nCamel, Camel\n\n01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.240\nSo we have to force ourselves\n\n01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.240\nTo have like a rib cage\n\n01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.240\nWhere we're like...\n\n01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.240\nThere's people who are more likely to be here\n\n01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.240\nEvery single episode\n\n01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.240\nAnd if one of them's gone\n\n01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.240\nWe'll make a judgment call on whether\n\n01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.240\nThey vanish\n\n01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.240\nFor that episode or go into another room\n\n01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.240\nOr Spencer plays them, but largely\n\n01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.240\nOr if we just take that episode off\n\n01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.240\nBut so that there can be consistency\n\n01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.240\nOf character, and that's the other reason\n\n01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.240\nWe're moving it up earlier in the show\n\n01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.240\nSo that we'll be a little...\n\n01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.240\nA little hair more towards sober\n\n01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.240\nAnd that's one of the things\n\n01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.240\nIt's like...\n\n01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.240\nWhat was the question?\n\n01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.240\nThe question was\n\n01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.240\nHow do you integrate\n\n01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.240\nA woman\n\n01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.240\nNo, no, no, that's not the question\n\n01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.240\nThat's not the question\n\n01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.240\nStarting with the same players\n\n01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.240\nBecause the answer is\n\n01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.240\nYou start bringing strangers up on stage every week\n\n01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.240\nAnd that's what I'm trying to explain\n\n01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.240\nIs that we have to take a hit on gender equality\n\n01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.240\nAnd all that stuff in the interest\n\n01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.240\nOf a solid D&D campaign\n\n01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.240\nBecause we don't...\n\n01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.240\nThat's what they said about baseball\n\n01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:20.240\nHahaha\n\n01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.240\nAnd now we have our own postage stamps\n\n01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.240\nHahaha\n\n01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.240\nIt looks like we made it\n\n01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.240\nYou guys got a hundred million dollar movie\n\n01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.240\nWhat is that?\n\n01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.240\nWhat are you talking about? It's Wonder Woman\n\n01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.240\nIt's like a record breaking thing\n\n01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.240\nIs a hundred million dollars good?\n\n01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.240\nYeah\n\n01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.240\nYes\n\n01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.240\nYeah, that's good for a movie\n\n01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.240\nTo make it its first weekend\n\n01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.240\nWhat's your fucking character's name?\n\n01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.240\nThat was the question\n\n01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.240\nI'm not telling you yet\n\n01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.240\nNo, that's my character's name\n\n01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.240\nYou're a human cleric, you said?\n\n01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.240\nYou're a human cleric\n\n01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.240\nAnd you guys are in service\n\n01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.240\nOf the Church of the Silver Flame\n\n01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.240\nYeah\n\n01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.240\nWhat's your character's name?\n\n01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.240\nI had the Fire Liker\n\n01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.240\nDo you know your character's name?\n\n01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.240\nI haven't really thought about it\n\n01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.240\nWell, this is the time\n\n01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.240\nI announced I was going to come back\n\n01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.240\nAnd we were going to play D&D\n\n01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.240\nYou guys don't even have names for your characters\n\n01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.240\nWe've been hurt by you before\n\n01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.240\nYou announced\n\n01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.240\nWe were going to play D&D\n\n01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.240\nYou left us\n\n01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.240\nThis show doesn't pay\n\n01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.240\nWe were leaving the meltdown\n\n01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.240\nWe had to just find the castle\n\n01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.240\nYou changed the box at the comic book store\n\n01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.240\nWe couldn't even find it\n\n01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.240\nI missed you guys\n\n01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.240\nI got excited about our new campaign\n\n01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.240\nI picked my spells\n\n01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.240\nI picked your spells\n\n01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.240\nNo, it's not true\n\n01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.240\nWe consulted about that\n\n01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.240\nIs there a middle gear\n\n01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.240\nbetween\n\n01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.240\npassionate\n\n01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.240\nzealously\n\n01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.240\nI'm so dedicated to us\n\n01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.240\ndoing this particular thing right now\n\n01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.240\nAnd you totally fucking leaving the show\n\n01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.240\nLike just you coming back\n\n01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.240\nand just being like, oh, I'm back\n\n01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.240\nIt's good to be back\n\n01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.240\nIt's okay, Dan Forgotty was a human cleric\n\n01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.240\nDan is right, Jeff\n\n01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.240\nFuck you, Brandon\n\n01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.240\nYou're like Ulysses\n\n01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.240\nHe comes back\n\n01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.240\nHe's like, who's trying to fuck my wife?\n\n01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.240\nAnd then he kills everybody\n\n01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.240\nYou know, one of those guys\n\n01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.240\nI was like, I was told you were dead\n\n01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.240\nI came to propose to your wife\n\n01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.240\nI didn't touch her\n\n01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.240\nI was just participating in an arrow shooting contest\n\n01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.240\nNow I'm dead\n\n01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.240\nI've been away, maybe I'm overcompensating\n\n01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.240\nby my absence and I felt remiss\n\n01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.240\nand so I thought\n\n01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.240\na little bit about what spells I have\n\n01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.240\nThey're mostly fire because I'm Chad the Fire Liker\n\n01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.240\nAlright, I'm a gnome druid, by the way\n\n01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.240\nWhy do I always play small characters?\n\n01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.240\nIs that because I'm tall?\n\n01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.240\nI can't remember in this instance\n\n01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.240\nOh, because you liked the drawing I did\n\n01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.240\nOh, that's right\n\n01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.240\nWas the idea of this segment\n\n01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.240\nthat you just want us to tell\n\n01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.240\nyou stuff about our characters?\n\n01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.240\nWell, I mean, I really thought it would be\n\n01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.240\nquick to come up with the names\n\n01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.240\nand we'd move on\n\n01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.240\nYou're a cleric\n\n01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.240\nSo what kind of stuff are you into?\n\n01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.240\nLike, what's your alignment?\n\n01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.240\nOr even just what's your name?\n\n01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.240\nNo need to complicate it\n\n01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.240\nI think your name should be Chad also\n\n01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.240\nI was just going to say\n\n01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.240\nChad the Fire Hater\n\n01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.240\nChadrick, my name is Chadrick\n\n01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.240\nThat's not a good idea\n\n01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.240\nAnd then Steve will be the Fire Lover\n\n01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.240\nYeah, I mean, Carlos\n\n01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.240\nCarlos\n\n01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.240\nCarlos\n\n01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.240\nI like it\n\n01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.240\nCarlos\n\n01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.240\nJohnson\n\n01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.240\nCarlos Johnson\n\n01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.240\nWhat a funny name, Johnson\n\n01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.240\nYeah, where'd you get that?\n\n01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.240\nCarlos Johnson the Unimaginative\n\n01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.240\nPerfect\n\n01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.240\nSo you're like a healer, magic user kind of guy?\n\n01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.240\nI'm a cleric\n\n01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.240\nYeah\n\n01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.240\nSo what's your relationship to the...\n\n01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.240\nWell, what's Steve?\n\n01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.240\nI've been thinking about it while on stage\n\n01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.240\nand I was in Dan's office\n\n01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.240\nfor a phone call the other day\n\n01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.240\nAnd on his window\n\n01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.240\nboard\n\n01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.240\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:48.240\nI might\n\n01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.240\nThey're the words Diarrhea Junior\n\n01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.240\nAnd\n\n01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.240\nI was really\n\n01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.240\nGets my curiosity\n\n01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.240\nAnd\n\n01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.240\nI think that should be my name\n\n01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.240\nMaybe DJ for short\n\n01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.240\nOh, that's great\n\n01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.240\nDJ, that's great\n\n01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.240\nOkay, that's good\n\n01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.240\nThis role-playing game is playing itself\n\n01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.240\nYeah, so now we got to come up\n\n01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.240\nwith your characters, high concepts\n\n01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.240\nand your great weaknesses\n\n01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.240\nSo, I mean, concepts\n\n01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.240\nare already kind of come up\n\n01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.240\nYou're a pyromaniac gnome\n\n01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.240\nUsually come up with your concept\n\n01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.240\nbecause yours is generic\n\n01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.240\nAnd Steve, you're kind of like a\n\n01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.240\nperson who can give people Diarrhea\n\n01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.240\nIs that his special power?\n\n01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240\nOh, I mean, I think his power is he has it\n\n01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.240\nHe has to stay out of pools for 14 days\n\n01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.240\n14 days\n\n01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.240\nHe has to drink a lot\n\n01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.240\nDJ the no pool swimmer\n\n01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.240\nHis weaknesses, he has to\n\n01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.240\ndrink a lot of Pedialyte all the time\n\n01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.240\nWell, he can't resist it\n\n01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.240\nAnd your flaws, if you came up\n\n01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.240\nwith a concept, come up with a flaw\n\n01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.240\nSo the concept is that\n\n01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.240\ndoes that translate into game terms\n\n01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.240\nNo, it's just like\n\n01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.240\nI mean, if you're pitching Jeff Winger\n\n01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.240\nyou're all like, you know, out of work\n\n01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.240\nWell, I don't know, you know, but like that\n\n01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.240\nBut for your character\n\n01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.240\nYou didn't have anything in mind for that one\n\n01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.240\nNo, because I don't know, I only know what Jeff's going to be\n\n01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:22.240\nAnd Steve said he was kind of basing\n\n01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.240\nhis off link from Zelda, so that's kind\n\n01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.240\nof his concept, but you don't really have one\n\n01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.240\nWell, I think I'd like to be\n\n01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.240\nan overzealous\n\n01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.240\nI mean, that's judging the character\n\n01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.240\nbut he's\n\n01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.240\na zealous like\n\n01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.240\nHe's a zealot\n\n01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.240\nI think you'd call him\n\n01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.240\nLike one of those Westboro Baptists\n\n01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.240\nYeah, like somebody that\n\n01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.240\nbut not somebody that's\n\n01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.240\nlike a cult leader in the making\n\n01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.240\nlike somebody that has\n\n01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.240\nthat's so zealous\n\n01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.240\nthat it's really more about their ego\n\n01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.240\nlike a genuine zealot who actually has\n\n01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.240\na fucking\n\n01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.240\nproblem, like they found\n\n01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.240\nmeaning in this religion\n\n01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.240\nand if it weren't for this religion\n\n01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.240\nthey'd be so fucked up, it's unspeakable\n\n01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.240\nso they're hooked on it\n\n01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.240\nand can't like\n\n01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.240\nso maybe this person is like\n\n01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.240\nYou're like Christopher Eccleston\n\n01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:22.240\nin The Leftovers\n\n01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.240\nI haven't seen it, but\n\n01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.240\nI would say\n\n01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.240\nI would assume maybe like my character has\n\n01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.240\na problem, like they're a sociopath\n\n01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:32.240\nYou know, like Richard Spencer\n\n01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.240\nDid you ever see that? Yeah\n\n01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.240\nshitty people with Spencer in their name\n\n01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.240\nit sucks\n\n01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.240\nDid you ever see that\n\n01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.240\n1992 YouTube video, it's 28 minutes long\n\n01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.240\ncalled Child of Rage\n\n01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.240\nit's this little girl, she keeps going\n\n01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.240\nand there's an off-screen therapist that keeps going\n\n01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.240\nlike, what would you like to do to your little brother\n\n01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.240\npick him with pans\n\n01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.240\nlike she's like, because she was adopted\n\n01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.240\nand she was found like in a crib\n\n01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.240\nin her own piss and stuff and she like\n\n01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.240\nso she didn't know love and didn't\n\n01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.240\ndoesn't know how to process it\n\n01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.240\nlike there's something wrong with this guy\n\n01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.240\nthat then he found\n\n01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.240\nlike his religion\n\n01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.240\nright, he's not\n\n01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.240\nand it really has like given him meaning\n\n01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.240\nand direction, but he doesn't\n\n01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.240\nit hasn't helped him grow to the extent that\n\n01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.240\nif he were to ever say he needs\n\n01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.240\nthis religion to really keep him together\n\n01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.240\nright, I like that\n\n01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.240\nso much\n\n01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.240\nreligious\n\n01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.240\nfanatic, it's like when you meet somebody\n\n01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.240\nthat you're like, oh man, you're super\n\n01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.240\nsuper dedicated to being a nerd\n\n01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.240\nbecause if you weren't a nerd\n\n01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.240\nsomeone would actually give you Iron Man Armor\n\n01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.240\nthe first thing you do is step on innocent people's heads\n\n01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.240\nbecause you're so angry\n\n01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.240\nbut not like, I don't think this guy has rage issues\n\n01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.240\nas much as I think he actually\n\n01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:46.240\ndoesn't know right from wrong\n\n01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.240\nand so he's relieved to feel that\n\n01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.240\nyeah\n\n01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.240\nI like it, so\n\n01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.240\nalright, come up with, Steve do you have anything yet\n\n01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:56.240\ncome up with weaknesses if you haven't yet\n\n01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.240\nthink about that, Steve do you have anything\n\n01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.240\nfor concept weakness\n\n01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.240\nwhat's Diarrhea Jr's race and class again\n\n01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.240\nhe's an elf or half elf\n\n01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.240\nhe's a elf fighter\n\n01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.240\nI think that my guys\n\n01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.240\nmy guys weakness would be susceptibility\n\n01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.240\nto like kind of charm\n\n01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.240\nlike kind of things because if he's like\n\n01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.240\nhe doesn't have like a follower\n\n01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.240\nwell yeah he doesn't\n\n01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.240\nif you can break through his force\n\n01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.240\nfield of\n\n01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.240\nof\n\n01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.240\nsocial programming that he\n\n01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.240\nanybody that had\n\n01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.240\nthat was in the business\n\n01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.240\nof making people think things\n\n01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.240\nor illusion magic or stuff like that\n\n01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.240\nthat he'd be a little more susceptible\n\n01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.240\nmaybe he'd have a penalty against that because he's like\n\n01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.240\nkind of\n\n01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.240\nis that a good weakness\n\n01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.240\nit's okay\n\n01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.240\nmaybe he's a guy who\n\n01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.240\nhopes his weaknesses are up to stuff\n\n01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.240\nhe's really insecure about it\n\n01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.240\nthen you have extreme nut allergies\n\n01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.240\ncan you\n\n01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.240\ncan you help me\n\n01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.240\nI'm not jazzed about that\n\n01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.240\nit's hard to say because the only thing is\n\n01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.240\nI think this is kind of what I told Jeff a little bit\n\n01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.240\nit would be better if they weren't part of your character\n\n01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.240\nconcept so it's like\n\n01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.240\nthat's kind of a natural consequence of your\n\n01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.240\nconcept so this would be a more lateral\n\n01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.240\nweakness\n\n01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.240\nhe also\n\n01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.240\nhe never turns right\n\n01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.240\noh okay\n\n01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.240\npolio\n\n01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.240\nsure\n\n01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.240\npolio\n\n01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.240\ndo you get wheeled around\n\n01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.240\npolio\n\n01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.240\nmy dad survived\n\n01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.240\nthe polio epidemic in the 50s\n\n01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.240\nso he has like a withered leg\n\n01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.240\nmy dad\n\n01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.240\nso I grew up with a very masculine dad who\n\n01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.240\nwalked with a masculine limp\n\n01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.240\nbut when he wears shorts he says like this little\n\n01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.240\ntoothpick leg\n\n01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.240\nthis is real life\n\n01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.240\nI'm Carlos the unimaginative\n\n01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.240\nI\n\n01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.240\nI write what I know\n\n01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.240\nso I was\n\n01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.240\nmaybe I\n\n01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.240\nI literally have a physical\n\n01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.240\nlimitation\n\n01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.240\nlike I had\n\n01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.240\nI survived a disease\n\n01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.240\nthat left me permanently\n\n01:19:12.240

weekend\n\n01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.240\nthe choices you're making right now will stick\n\n01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.240\nwith you for a long time\n\n01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.240\nno I'm trying to yeah I mean go big\n\n01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.240\nor go home right\n\n01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.240\nI mean he's a cleric so I figured you know like he's\n\n01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.240\nyeah like

01:27:46.240\nwere murdered\n\n01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.240\nbut the church\n\n01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:50.240\ntook me in\n\n01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.240\nbut the thing that I don't know is that\n\n01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.240\nit was the church that murdered my entire\n\n01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.240\nvillage including my parents\n\n01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.240\nokay I don't

--> 01:28:06.240\ngreat Jeff\n\n01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:08.240\nyeah I think that\n\n01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:10.240\nlike I said I feel like\n\n01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.240\nI was kind of born in captivity\n\n01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:14.240\nright and you're in darkness by demons\n\n01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:16.240\nin darkness surrounded by demons and all there\n\n01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.240\nwas was like the only light was like flaming\n\n01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:20.240\ntorches and the rest of my family\n\n01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.240\nwere just these like super religious\n\n01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.240\nvery docile\n\n01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.240\nDruids who didn't believe in violence\n\n01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.240\nthey were so pure\n\n01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.240\nand I didn't want to\n\n01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.240\njust die in there like I watched all my family\n\n01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.240\ndie inside this like these wooden cages\n\n01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.240\ninside this like darkness\n\n01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.240\nand I thought the only way to get out\n\n01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.240\nis I like I heard your family\n\n01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.240\ndying yeah I heard them die right\n\n01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:44.240\nwell you can there's a little flickering\n\n01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.240\nof flame you can kind of you see them fall over\n\n01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.240\nshadows there could be a twist to season\n\n01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.240\nthree where we reveal in flashback oh no\n\n01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:52.240\nit was yeah that was a sock\n\n01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.240\nbut\n\n01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.240\nbut then like I like\n\n01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.240\nbecause they were so docile they didn't\n\n01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.240\nlike ever used like their\n\n01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.240\ndruidic powers like\n\n01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.240\nthere was no nature in there to really\n\n01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.240\nsummon because we're just like we're so\n\n01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.240\nunderground and hidden that\n\n01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.240\nI like I think I like communed\n\n01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.240\nwith like the silver flame\n\n01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.240\nyou know who's the spirit that\n\n01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.240\nyou call to the spirit of the silver flame\n\n01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.240\nright I called to that\n\n01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.240\nand I was given this kind of\n\n01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.240\nextra violent power of fire\n\n01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.240\nand I ended up just burning my way out\n\n01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.240\nand kind of like so I'm like I like I'm\n\n01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.240\nusing like it seems like an anti-nature\n\n01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.240\nthing to like to want to set things on fire\n\n01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.240\nbut that was how I got out\n\n01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.240\nand so I'm just kind of\n\n01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.240\nI think I'm a little guilt-ridden about the fact that I have\n\n01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.240\nmore of a violent tendency than I wish I did\n\n01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.240\nso I try to use it like my flames\n\n01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.240\nto purify things and purify myself\n\n01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.240\nI like it\n\n01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:46.240\nI almost started crying\n\n01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.240\nI like that there's a theme of darkness\n\n01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.240\nlike we don't just have

outskirts\n\n01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:48.240\nfor a while because it's like the pachinko\n\n01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.240\nmachine of society like brought me to\n\n01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.240\nlike

not saying this is our first\n\n01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.240\nadventure because like I said we're starting\n\n01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.240\nepisode 7 but maybe the origin was that\n\n01:35:18.240
