WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.320
Well, I was gone for far too long, but now I'm back.

00:10.320 --> 00:17.800
I was gone for too long, your Comptroller was black.

00:17.800 --> 00:29.960
But now I'm back and here to stay, and all I want to say is

00:29.960 --> 00:36.400
Some people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out why.

00:36.400 --> 00:42.880
I don't really have a Pringles Dick, I just keep my dick inside.

00:42.880 --> 00:49.280
I keep my dick inside a Pringles can, because it keeps my penis safe and dry.

00:49.280 --> 00:53.600
Some people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.280
No, I never found out.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.920
I never really found out why, if you know, sing along.

00:58.920 --> 01:05.280
Some people call me Pringles Dick, but I never found out why.

01:05.280 --> 01:11.760
I don't really have a Pringles Dick, I just keep my dick inside.

01:11.760 --> 01:18.280
I keep my dick inside a Pringles can, because it keeps my penis safe and dry.

01:18.280 --> 01:22.680
Some people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.360
No, I never found out.

01:24.360 --> 01:27.640
I never really found out why.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.800
Ladies and gentlemen, hit it.

01:30.800 --> 01:41.800
From beautiful uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.800
Spencer Crittenden.

01:43.800 --> 02:03.480
And the mayor of Harmontown, I missed you so much, Mr. Dan Harmons.

02:03.480 --> 02:17.400
Thank you.

02:17.400 --> 02:22.320
You left your shit everywhere.

02:22.320 --> 02:30.000
How does the video, should I put this back further out, or should I, okay, you're good.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.840
All right, when I watch the feed, I like the shot where you get a clear shot of Spencer

02:34.840 --> 02:37.360
and then the mannequins back there, it looks beautiful.

02:37.360 --> 02:41.040
Five dollars a month, and you'd know what I was talking about.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.280
Thank you guys for coming out, thanks for coming to Burbank, thanks for living in Burbank,

02:45.280 --> 02:46.280
if you live here.

02:46.280 --> 02:53.200
Somebody have a pen I can borrow for the show, anybody pen, pencil?

02:53.200 --> 02:59.000
There's a little bit of official business, you know, we, I mean, we've been getting

02:59.000 --> 03:07.200
this venue up and running, and we can't be an official, we can't sell you booze, so great,

03:07.200 --> 03:15.240
we have to give it to you for, that's, I love that about society, that it has, legally

03:15.240 --> 03:22.920
it has to be free, okay, that's the kind of Pringles professor you like, you know, like

03:22.920 --> 03:26.880
he stops the party in the library and says like, you need to read books about Pringles

03:26.880 --> 03:37.080
then, and it had no sense, but it's like free flowing hard liquor, but I don't think that's

03:37.080 --> 03:42.920
the problem, as you know, if you're here live, we had to start checking your bags tonight,

03:42.920 --> 03:49.120
now here's why, you're coming here to listen to me complain about our dissent into fascism

03:49.120 --> 03:54.640
and now you have to, pretty soon there's going to be metal detectors out there, what can

03:54.640 --> 04:03.120
I say about Burbank, it's a tougher hood, man, what it is, we've got a nice big room

04:03.120 --> 04:08.200
now, we can fit a lot of you in here, there's a free spirit, we're anarchists, we love,

04:08.200 --> 04:15.000
we love no rules, somebody's got something to say, they say it, et cetera, but you know,

04:15.000 --> 04:20.480
so now it's like, okay, how do we coexist as a civilization, people have been bringing

04:20.480 --> 04:25.640
shit and getting shit faced, like if you just brought stuff, maybe it's illegal for me to

04:25.640 --> 04:29.480
say this, but if you just brought stuff and you could see, there you go, you heard somebody

04:29.480 --> 04:35.920
right there falling over, but like, I mean, just anecdotally, there were a couple of guys

04:35.920 --> 04:41.560
apparently last episode, or maybe one before that, I can't remember, but you know, we just

04:41.560 --> 04:52.920
have your standard security people, they didn't sign up to do any heart surgery or, you know,

04:52.920 --> 04:56.400
they had to like, bounce a couple guys and I guess one guy immediately as soon as he

04:56.400 --> 05:01.520
got, because they were just shit faced, like walking into walls, and then they went out

05:01.520 --> 05:08.960
as a pair and one of them, the official report on our side was that he turned to Jell-O,

05:08.960 --> 05:14.840
he fell to the floor and started pissing and shitting himself, and couldn't get up, his

05:14.840 --> 05:22.960
friend took off running because he had a $50,000 warrant, so thank you for letting us check

05:22.960 --> 05:30.200
your purse, it's not you, it's those two guys, but also it's like, I'm sorry if I caught

05:30.200 --> 05:32.920
you off guard, because it's like, well maybe you have weed in your purse and you're like,

05:32.920 --> 05:38.920
what is this, the fucking thing, there's also been people like smoking in there, you know,

05:38.920 --> 05:45.280
in the inside here, and it's like, it's all, if you just run it through the flowchart of

05:45.280 --> 05:51.440
like, am I hurting anyone around me, am I interfering with anyone else's good time,

05:51.440 --> 05:57.680
which also doubles as when a cop comes in here, is this place going to get shut down,

05:57.680 --> 06:01.840
because that cheats everybody, so in order to keep honest people honest, we're just kind

06:01.840 --> 06:05.480
of going, okay, so you can't be, you know, we're going to check your bags and stuff,

06:05.480 --> 06:11.560
but this is, I'm not looking at this as a, this is our chance to explore how societies

06:11.560 --> 06:16.840
begin, I'm sure, minus the electronics, this is basically equivalent to the first Thanksgiving,

06:16.840 --> 06:17.840
right?

06:17.840 --> 06:26.120
So like, listen, some of you, I understand you make houses out of buffalo, look, we love

06:26.120 --> 06:34.520
it, but, I don't know, but you've got to accept these smallpox, it's called a social

06:34.520 --> 06:41.600
contract, but anyways, that's that, so if any of you are miffed by that, you can continue

06:41.600 --> 06:44.760
to be miffed by that, I'm not telling you to not be miffed by any invasion of your

06:44.760 --> 06:51.080
stuff, but it's like, we're just doing what we can to bottleneck the inhumanity, so that

06:51.080 --> 07:00.600
everybody can have a good time, and the other official business is Jeff's back, hello.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.680
I missed you guys, it's been a long time.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.560
I've been enjoying listening to the show, though, I thought Brandon did a bang up job.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.640
Brandon is amazing.

07:09.640 --> 07:15.480
I kind of felt like, not nervous to come back, but I felt like maybe like he had stolen

07:15.480 --> 07:18.880
everybody's hearts away, and like, I, like, I, I like what it's brought out of you.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.680
You come back with a ukulele, there's this thing, it's good to see you on your toes.

07:21.680 --> 07:26.840
I felt like I had to, I had to put some hee-haw showbiz into this shit, like I, the, the,

07:26.840 --> 07:32.760
the downside was it also brought out of a lash of racism, like you were, I mean, it just,

07:32.760 --> 07:36.720
it brought it, but I'd rather just have, yeah, just have all of you, you know, I think.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.280
Yeah, yeah, he was, he was black the entire time.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.280
He was black.

07:40.280 --> 07:44.400
Also, I mean, I feel so nervous about coming back, and Spencer and I, and the halfway mark

07:44.400 --> 07:46.840
of the show, we're going to do love letters.

07:46.840 --> 07:47.840
Yeah.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.360
Yeah, it's a nice stage set up now, and we're going to continue.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.120
That's a play that two people do.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.720
We're moving toward, there's, there's going to be a wireless environment up here, it's

07:57.720 --> 08:01.800
going to be like going to an Apple Keynote pretty soon one day, it's going to be, I'm

08:01.800 --> 08:05.240
going to come, I'm going to come out in a turtleneck, or maybe, maybe a turtle in a

08:05.240 --> 08:06.240
half-neck.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.320
I just, I just wrote that.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.360
A turtle in a half-neck.

08:10.360 --> 08:11.360
That's pretty awesome.

08:11.360 --> 08:15.800
It's like, it comes up to your lower lip, like, I don't know, the new, I just, I just

08:15.800 --> 08:19.040
figured I'm two turtle, one and a half turtles, I don't know, it's pretty good, I don't know,

08:19.040 --> 08:20.040
I'm kind of good.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.800
I mean, you know, this venue's like awakening the entertainer in it, a turtle in a half-neck.

08:23.800 --> 08:28.800
See, I, I, my ukulele inspired the vaudeville showbiz guy inside you.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.800
Yeah.

08:29.800 --> 08:34.320
Yeah, let's, let's, do you want to try, let's try something real quick, speaking of, because

08:34.320 --> 08:39.920
we were testing the equipment and, you know, so, you know, oh, Harmon, try to strike a

08:39.920 --> 08:43.120
balance between the, you know, you don't want to turn it into a TV show, because the people

08:43.120 --> 08:49.980
listening, but that doesn't preclude, like, the music stuff, so I got my, I got my garage

08:49.980 --> 08:55.800
band and you got your ukulele and then, oh, awesome, why should I get my ukulele in it?

08:55.800 --> 09:05.600
Well, yeah, yeah, well, I mean, if you want, yeah, I'm, yeah, I've been enjoying, if you

09:05.600 --> 09:10.280
guys have not treated yourself to Dan's garage band, like little Instagram videos are pretty,

09:10.280 --> 09:11.280
pretty tasty.

09:11.280 --> 09:12.280
Yeah.

09:12.280 --> 09:15.680
You can really find out what it's like to hear Dan sing about pooping.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.120
Oh, oh, what are you, what are you talking about?

09:18.120 --> 09:22.280
You're saying, oh, well, I guess since I opened GarageBand, I might as well play one of my

09:22.280 --> 09:23.280
songs.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.280
I think you should.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.280
Have you got to do it?

09:25.280 --> 09:26.280
Yeah, this is a lesson.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.280
No, let's go to Classics.

09:27.280 --> 09:30.280
Sing and, so, from outer space

09:30.280 --> 09:32.280
For those of you who are fine following Dan you should sing

09:32.280 --> 09:33.280
Cena's

09:33.280 --> 09:35.280
ACLLEY

09:35.280 --> 09:38.280
Superman's place

09:38.280 --> 09:41.280
From your great friend

09:41.280 --> 09:42.340
We're criminal

09:42.340 --> 09:45.060
It's where you come from where other beings grow

09:45.060 --> 09:47.260
I'm just a lonely potato

09:47.260 --> 09:49.160
I only know what I know

09:49.160 --> 09:50.320
And I know

09:50.320 --> 09:52.640
I was born in the dirt

09:52.640 --> 09:54.640
and the Earth is the nausea

09:54.640 --> 10:04.640
But now I can't look, I'm probably at my beam from outer space

10:07.640 --> 10:09.640
See

10:10.640 --> 10:11.640
Wow

10:15.640 --> 10:17.640
That one I did for my beam, Cody

10:17.640 --> 10:22.640
That was somewhere right in the middle, like equidistant between Lenny Kravitz and Abba

10:22.640 --> 10:27.640
With a lengthy stop at George Michael's filling station

10:27.640 --> 10:28.640
Oh yeah, yeah

10:28.640 --> 10:31.640
It's where you come from where other beans grow

10:31.640 --> 10:35.640
I'm just a lonely potato, I only know what I know

10:35.640 --> 10:38.640
And I know I was born in the dirt

10:41.640 --> 10:44.640
You should have a fucking record, you could have a record, Dan

10:44.640 --> 10:47.640
I'm gonna see if logical maybe produced my album

10:47.640 --> 10:48.640
Yeah

10:48.640 --> 10:54.640
Now that he's number one, boy is he gonna regret becoming friends with me before he became a number one hip-hop artist

10:55.640 --> 10:58.640
I'm like texting him every day, I'm like, what do you think of this?

10:58.640 --> 11:00.640
He's like, it's hip-hop delicious

11:00.640 --> 11:03.640
I have to say that from the time I was away listening to the show

11:03.640 --> 11:06.640
You grew a lot because you started fucking dads now, that's great

11:06.640 --> 11:09.640
I tried, I tried everything, you know

11:10.640 --> 11:14.640
Alright, well yeah, but okay, so my new thing is garagemen

11:14.640 --> 11:18.640
Because you don't have to be good at it, it's a hobby for me now

11:18.640 --> 11:20.640
So I can really lose myself in it

11:20.640 --> 11:25.640
So you were telling me a good chord progression is

11:25.640 --> 11:27.640
Oh shit, this doesn't have the, where is the...

11:27.640 --> 11:29.640
Yeah, you made a new song

11:29.640 --> 11:31.640
Where's the D?

11:31.640 --> 11:33.640
Go back to the old song that you did

11:33.640 --> 11:35.640
It's okay, we can do CGFs, gotcha

11:35.640 --> 11:41.640
Okay, so I'm learning as people are paying to watch

11:41.640 --> 11:44.640
That's fine, that's fine

11:45.640 --> 11:47.640
The good thing for people listening and not watching

11:47.640 --> 11:49.640
Is there's nothing happening on the screen, really, worth watching

11:49.640 --> 11:51.640
No, no, we're not, yeah

11:51.640 --> 11:54.640
But yeah, my favorite thing about garagemen is the strings

11:54.640 --> 11:57.640
Because if you rub them hard, it gets...

11:59.640 --> 12:01.640
But if you rub them really soft

12:01.640 --> 12:09.640
It's been seven hours and fifteen days

12:14.640 --> 12:15.640
Wait, you said it

12:15.640 --> 12:16.640
We almost had it

12:16.640 --> 12:23.640
D, G, A, C, D

12:23.640 --> 12:26.640
Is that, can we hop this mic back up, the other guy?

12:28.640 --> 12:29.640
Oh man

12:29.640 --> 12:31.640
So D, G, A, 7, D

12:31.640 --> 12:34.640
Yeah, that's a nice three chord kind of thing

12:36.640 --> 12:38.640
Oh, I guess we probably need a metronome, right?

12:38.640 --> 12:40.640
Yeah, give me a beat

12:43.640 --> 12:46.640
Can you put an actual, can you lay a beat in there?

12:46.640 --> 12:47.640
Yeah, I could

12:47.640 --> 12:48.640
Give us a beat

12:48.640 --> 12:50.640
What would you like the drummer's name to be?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.640
I'm a fucking Tommy Lee

12:55.640 --> 12:59.640
Uh, SoCal?

13:01.640 --> 13:02.640
SoCal

13:02.640 --> 13:03.640
Wait, I thought...

13:03.640 --> 13:05.640
Okay, wait, well, no, wait, how come...

13:06.640 --> 13:09.640
Okay, now that people aren't watching or missing something

13:09.640 --> 13:11.640
Because now there's drums on the thing

13:11.640 --> 13:12.640
Wait, this is very exciting

13:12.640 --> 13:14.640
I think it's different if you get a drummer

13:14.640 --> 13:16.640
Okay, drummer, that's what I need

13:17.640 --> 13:18.640
Okay, you want Lea here?

13:18.640 --> 13:20.640
This is like the scene in the movie Iceman

13:20.640 --> 13:25.640
The Iceman finds out that he's an Iceman

13:26.640 --> 13:29.640
Is that to Silver Lake for you?

13:29.640 --> 13:32.640
Would you like me to change Lea?

13:32.640 --> 13:36.640
I could change Lea to Jay Fister

13:41.640 --> 13:43.640
He's too complicated

13:43.640 --> 13:47.640
I don't need your parents' divorce involved in my song

13:47.640 --> 13:51.640
Maurice looks like he's wearing glasses

13:53.640 --> 13:55.640
I don't know, all these people are too...

13:56.640 --> 13:58.640
That beat really screams ukulele

13:59.640 --> 14:01.640
You know what? You know who I missed? Lea

14:03.640 --> 14:06.640
Sorry, Lea, I didn't mean to ever stray

14:06.640 --> 14:08.640
Okay, alright, so there's our beat

14:08.640 --> 14:14.640
And that's one, two, three, four

14:14.640 --> 14:15.640
Okay, alright

14:15.640 --> 14:19.640
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

14:19.640 --> 14:22.640
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

14:22.640 --> 14:26.640
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

14:26.640 --> 14:27.640
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

14:27.640 --> 14:28.640
Here comes Lea

14:28.640 --> 14:29.640
Okay, here we go

14:29.640 --> 14:37.640
D, G, A7, D

14:37.640 --> 14:39.640
Let's record it

14:42.640 --> 14:44.640
It'll give us a count-in and then we'll record it

14:44.640 --> 14:47.640
We made one-hundredth of a song

14:48.640 --> 14:51.640
No, this is about half the time I spend on my Instagram stocks

14:51.640 --> 14:53.640
Alright, so here we go

14:53.640 --> 14:56.640
Can you make a loop and then improvise a song?

14:56.640 --> 14:57.640
We can record right now

14:57.640 --> 14:59.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so here comes the count-in

14:59.640 --> 15:11.640
D, G, A7, D, G

15:11.640 --> 15:12.640
Let's see it

15:12.640 --> 15:17.640
G, A7, D

15:17.640 --> 15:18.640
I'm gonna do it better now

15:18.640 --> 15:23.640
D, G, A7, D

15:23.640 --> 15:31.640
That's the fuck up right there, okay

15:31.640 --> 15:34.640
One more loop, one more there

15:34.640 --> 15:43.640
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight

15:43.640 --> 15:53.640
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight

15:53.640 --> 15:59.640
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight

15:59.640 --> 16:01.640
I like this kind of a little vibrato

16:06.640 --> 16:07.640
I didn't know it was still in there

16:07.640 --> 16:08.640
Alright, well, hold on

16:08.640 --> 16:09.640
We gotta re-record it

16:09.640 --> 16:10.640
We gotta fix that, we gotta fix that

16:10.640 --> 16:11.640
You hadn't re-recorded it

16:11.640 --> 16:12.640
Oh, oh, okay, sorry

16:12.640 --> 16:13.640
You just recorded the first one

16:13.640 --> 16:14.640
Okay, here we go, one, two, three

16:14.640 --> 16:15.640
One, two, three

16:15.640 --> 16:29.640
D, G, A7, D, A7, A7, A7, A7, A7, A7, A7

16:29.640 --> 16:34.640
D, G, A7, D, A7, A7, A7, A7, A7

16:34.640 --> 16:36.640
What? How come it's...?

16:36.640 --> 16:38.640
Yeah, you can look at that.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.640
Yeah, can you hear that?

16:40.640 --> 16:42.640
Can you hear that sound?

16:42.640 --> 16:44.640
Yeah.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.640
I saw you.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.640
I saw you.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.640
I heard you.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.640
I saw you.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.640
I heard you.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.640
Yeah, you can look at that.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.640
I'm going every time.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.640
I've never seen you come around.

17:02.640 --> 17:08.640
I've never seen you come around.

17:08.640 --> 17:20.640
Hey now, get your game on.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.640
I'll let you shine.

17:22.640 --> 17:28.640
You gotta smash your mouth.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.240
I was not gonna walk on the sun and I'm gonna smash your mouth

17:31.240 --> 17:32.440
I'm gonna put it in your mouth

17:32.440 --> 17:33.440
I was gonna put it in your mouth

17:33.440 --> 17:34.940
I'm gonna make you the same

17:34.940 --> 17:37.540
All the good things that's going on in the fucking momma

17:37.540 --> 17:39.540
So I'm gonna take this course

17:39.540 --> 17:41.240
I'm gonna do it so you see it

17:41.240 --> 17:42.240
I'm gonna do it so hard

17:42.240 --> 17:43.240
I'm gonna put it in your mouth

17:43.240 --> 17:44.240
I'm gonna put it in your mouth

17:44.240 --> 17:45.240
I'm gonna put it in your mouth

17:45.240 --> 17:48.040
How they even the Wonder Woman box office

17:48.040 --> 17:48.440
So

17:52.840 --> 17:53.740
Women

17:54.940 --> 17:56.240
Better than men

17:56.240 --> 17:58.240
Better than men

17:58.240 --> 18:00.240
Better than men

18:00.240 --> 18:05.240
How come women are so much better than men?

18:05.240 --> 18:09.240
How come all women are better than men?

18:09.240 --> 18:11.240
Does it matter what note you sing?

18:11.240 --> 18:12.240
Do you do the chords?

18:12.240 --> 18:13.240
Are they on their day?

18:13.240 --> 18:15.240
Do you have to sing along with the chords?

18:15.240 --> 18:16.240
Do you know it?

18:16.240 --> 18:18.240
Do you just sing it to the throat?

18:21.240 --> 18:22.240
Yes or no?

18:22.240 --> 18:23.240
Yes or no?

18:26.240 --> 18:32.240
Well, it's nice to be back in the heart of the town

18:36.240 --> 18:38.240
It's nice to be back

18:38.240 --> 18:40.240
Oh shit, I fucked up

18:41.240 --> 18:42.240
Alright, one more time

18:42.240 --> 18:44.240
Just wanna get those strings right and then we'll move on

18:45.240 --> 18:47.240
Because I feel like the velocity's not...

18:47.240 --> 18:48.240
I'm not...

18:48.240 --> 18:52.240
The velocity's fucked

19:02.240 --> 19:04.240
It's the double D, that's what gets you

19:04.240 --> 19:05.240
Yeah

19:05.240 --> 19:06.240
Every time

19:06.240 --> 19:19.240
Alright, one more time then we'll get to the show

19:27.240 --> 19:29.240
That's the one

19:29.240 --> 19:39.240
I fucking miss Ryan Stiles so much right now

19:39.240 --> 19:40.240
No, I miss Brandon

19:40.240 --> 19:41.240
Let's get Brandon up here

19:41.240 --> 19:43.240
Brandon Johnson!

19:51.240 --> 19:52.240
Hi

19:53.240 --> 19:56.240
God damn it, that was hilarious

19:56.240 --> 19:58.240
I love that last bit where you were

19:58.240 --> 20:00.240
I give a fuck

20:01.240 --> 20:03.240
Jeff James is back everybody

20:05.240 --> 20:06.240
Yes

20:07.240 --> 20:12.240
And I can go back to being the disgraced alderman of Harmontown

20:12.240 --> 20:14.240
Yeah, you did such a good job

20:14.240 --> 20:15.240
I was afraid to come back

20:15.240 --> 20:17.240
I thought that you...

20:17.240 --> 20:20.240
I liked your version of the show better than me on the show

20:20.240 --> 20:23.240
I can only tell you big shoes to fill

20:23.240 --> 20:25.240
Fucking, I had no idea what goes on

20:25.240 --> 20:27.240
There's an entire gold panel behind that thing

20:27.240 --> 20:28.240
It took you two hours of this shit

20:28.240 --> 20:30.240
That's the fucking hard part

20:30.240 --> 20:35.240
Big, big fancy shoes that only you two know how to talk about

20:35.240 --> 20:37.240
I like those loafers by the way, those are swinging

20:37.240 --> 20:39.240
Thanks so much, you look amazing

20:39.240 --> 20:41.240
The chain with the jacket

20:41.240 --> 20:42.240
Yeah, please

20:42.240 --> 20:44.240
I can't wear brown shoes, I look like I've heard it

20:49.240 --> 20:52.240
So much has changed since you left

20:52.240 --> 20:54.240
He hates it so much

20:54.240 --> 20:58.240
There was one episode when you had the journalists that had been overseas

20:58.240 --> 21:00.240
Like in Iraq and stuff like that

21:00.240 --> 21:02.240
And you kept asking them questions

21:02.240 --> 21:04.240
Well, you started the show by saying that you were really drunk

21:04.240 --> 21:06.240
And you interviewed them

21:06.240 --> 21:10.240
You kept asking questions and then answering their question for them

21:10.240 --> 21:12.240
And I came up with a new term

21:12.240 --> 21:14.240
It's called dance planning

21:18.240 --> 21:20.240
I told, I'm not a good interviewer

21:20.240 --> 21:23.240
I thought it was a good show, I don't care

21:24.240 --> 21:26.240
It was, they were fascinating

21:26.240 --> 21:28.240
Theoretically

21:28.240 --> 21:32.240
I heard a psychology, there was a podcast about emotions

21:32.240 --> 21:39.240
That I saw that said that there's this woman who's like the leading rock star

21:39.240 --> 21:41.240
Of emotional psychology right now

21:41.240 --> 21:44.240
But it's really weird because she's kind of counterintuitive

21:44.240 --> 21:51.240
She realizes herself that her theories and findings actually fly in the face

21:51.240 --> 21:59.240
Of any support for the kind of the safe space, trickery thing

21:59.240 --> 22:02.240
In that feelings don't happen to you

22:02.240 --> 22:04.240
They're not uncontrollable things

22:06.240 --> 22:09.240
I was kind of half asleep while I was listening to the podcast

22:09.240 --> 22:16.240
The weird thing is, I don't know who figures this shit out

22:16.240 --> 22:19.240
How do you measure this and who do you know is talking out of their ass

22:19.240 --> 22:24.240
That's why you have to look at certification and stuff and credentials

22:24.240 --> 22:31.240
But according to her, there's only really four actual honest emotional states

22:31.240 --> 22:33.240
For a human that you start with

22:33.240 --> 22:40.240
I think it's pleasant, unpleasant, aroused, and I can't remember

22:40.240 --> 22:44.240
Groupon, I don't know, I can't remember what the fourth one is even

22:44.240 --> 22:45.240
Shifty

22:45.240 --> 22:48.240
But it's not angry and it's not jealous and it's not sad

22:48.240 --> 22:53.240
I can't remember what it is, but it's basically the way that there's only really eight notes

22:53.240 --> 23:00.240
There's only four feelings, but then we, depending culturally

23:00.240 --> 23:03.240
If you're in ancient Sparta, then you have to have a certain attitude

23:03.240 --> 23:07.240
Towards murder, death, manhood, womanhood, etc

23:07.240 --> 23:13.240
Then if you go down the street to ancient Athens, they're working on the streets

23:13.240 --> 23:22.240
But all of that stuff, all the stuff that we call outrage or jealousy or sadness or rage

23:22.240 --> 23:31.240
Those are all social constructs that we're creating, that we're told, we're indoctrinated into them

23:31.240 --> 23:36.240
So when you're a kid on the playground and someone steals your fire truck toy

23:36.240 --> 23:40.240
You feel probably, I would guess, unpleasant about that

23:40.240 --> 23:44.240
And then your parents tell you, or the kid that's taking your fire truck tells you

23:44.240 --> 23:48.240
Or somehow you get the signal, you're told, I know you're angry right now

23:48.240 --> 23:53.240
What you're feeling is called anger and it has to do with fire trucks being taken away from you

23:53.240 --> 23:57.240
And so you learn that the same way you learn language

23:57.240 --> 24:01.240
But there's very few uncontrollable emotions, like you just kind of

24:01.240 --> 24:12.240
You have a pretty mellow four-part quartet of pretty almost indistinguishable kind of states of emotion

24:12.240 --> 24:19.240
That you then, I didn't really listen to it that much

24:19.240 --> 24:23.240
But she herself was saying, I know this is awful because she's a liberal and a progressive person

24:23.240 --> 24:28.240
But she's saying, this is honest data that I'm getting about, this is the way we really need to look at this

24:28.240 --> 24:37.240
Even though it actually suggests, it's kind of like the scientific way of saying suck it up buttercup in certain contexts

24:37.240 --> 24:42.240
Does that allow for nuances in between? You can be angry and different, okay

24:42.240 --> 24:45.240
No, no, our next guest

24:45.240 --> 24:52.240
At the top of the podcast episode, they say, because they're doing, and if I'm drawing at them, I should cite them

24:52.240 --> 24:56.240
It's called invisibilia, that's the name of the podcast

24:56.240 --> 25:05.240
At the top of the podcast they say, by the way, we've discovered a fifth emotional state

25:05.240 --> 25:09.240
So it's called ugut or something like that, and we'll get to that later

25:09.240 --> 25:17.240
They've found a tribe of people that can feel a fifth thing, I know it sounds absurd, but they have to agree

25:17.240 --> 25:22.240
The Jackson family

25:22.240 --> 25:29.240
But that fifth one is called germane

25:29.240 --> 25:36.240
Bring up my fancy mind map

25:36.240 --> 25:41.240
See, we just talked about that

25:41.240 --> 25:43.240
Let's go to Twitter, shall we?

25:43.240 --> 25:48.240
Yeah, with a quick stop

25:48.240 --> 26:03.240
When we were doing a...

26:03.240 --> 26:09.240
Loop, I got a perfect loop

26:09.240 --> 26:14.240
I got a perfect loop, I nailed this loop this time

26:14.240 --> 26:18.240
We'll get back to that later

26:18.240 --> 26:22.240
I just wanted to nail it, it was like a bike that stole me

26:22.240 --> 26:27.240
When we were doing soundcheck earlier, Dan plugged this thing in to make sure the audio and video was working

26:27.240 --> 26:32.240
Everybody, a quick porn check, he had to make sure he wasn't going to turn his computer on

26:32.240 --> 26:36.240
You would all get bombarded with mannequin porn or whatever

26:36.240 --> 26:39.240
Alright, who's this guy? Blind melanade

26:39.240 --> 26:44.240
Can you fix Dan's mic, it's super low, and then the music blows my speakers up

26:44.240 --> 26:47.240
I assume that person's...

26:47.240 --> 26:53.240
Every week we get people that say that the sound's way too low, and I wonder if they just have broken sound

26:53.240 --> 26:57.240
I'll be back later

26:57.240 --> 27:03.240
I have a show to do

27:03.240 --> 27:07.240
Alright

27:07.240 --> 27:12.240
Could you please just say fuck Patrick O'Leary, I guess I accidentally just did

27:12.240 --> 27:16.240
Is that a senator? I hope it's a senator

27:16.240 --> 27:24.240
A survivalism question I like to ask folks says Johnny Collins, whose Twitter name is Silver Tin Tine Music

27:24.240 --> 27:29.240
I feel Spencer may have some good ideas, sorry for the mini manifesto

27:29.240 --> 27:32.240
What's this guy's name?

27:32.240 --> 27:34.240
Oh good

27:34.240 --> 27:39.240
I feel like I'm in a porn country, we're going to see my porn any minute now

27:39.240 --> 27:42.240
Johnny Collins

27:42.240 --> 27:45.240
A survivalism question I like to ask folks

27:45.240 --> 27:47.240
Just cut to the bottom

27:47.240 --> 27:51.240
I click on those images, oh Jesus, and then it starts to go haywire

27:51.240 --> 27:54.240
I really need you to just tweet, just tweet, will you people?

27:54.240 --> 28:01.240
You can't just don't tweet a link to a thing, you're going to find out what I jerk off to you so fast

28:01.240 --> 28:06.240
What if you had a guess right now, it would be in the chamber in your porn windows right now

28:06.240 --> 28:10.240
We see if we came across it by accident

28:10.240 --> 28:16.240
Do you want me to tell people the thing I'm worried they'll know?

28:16.240 --> 28:19.240
Yeah, describe it for us

28:19.240 --> 28:22.240
You have to take the power away from them, man

28:22.240 --> 28:26.240
It's probably just hoverboard cut ventures or whatever

28:26.240 --> 28:29.240
By the way, worry is not a feeling

28:29.240 --> 28:40.240
It would be unpleasant for one split second of my bookmarks to haunt me for 40 years of potential political career

28:40.240 --> 28:44.240
On a scale of 1 to 10, how offensive do you think it would be?

28:44.240 --> 28:50.240
I think there's some hot buttons, I think that we're not a sexually progressive community

28:50.240 --> 28:54.240
I think that we all have little places that we go

28:54.240 --> 28:57.240
It's incest, it must be

28:57.240 --> 29:01.240
It doesn't make sense if this were like clown porn or something, that would be a weird speech

29:01.240 --> 29:05.240
But remember Riley Reed said incest is best

29:05.240 --> 29:09.240
She said incest is like way up on the porn hub searches

29:09.240 --> 29:14.240
Because anything that you could think of that's taboo, it's like

29:14.240 --> 29:20.240
But I see these arguments online where people go like, oh, it's like, and you can't, there's no heroes or villains in these stories

29:20.240 --> 29:27.240
This is what the internet is doing to all of us, it's like creating lack of context that is incredibly damaging to us

29:27.240 --> 29:36.240
I've asked it before and I wish we could, I wish we had a love connection, like private kind of polling ability

29:36.240 --> 29:40.240
Which I've said years ago so that we could actually ask the folks that come to these shows

29:40.240 --> 29:48.240
Things that they can answer honestly without any fear that they're having to clap when we say who here wants to fuck a dog

29:48.240 --> 29:51.240
That they can just

29:55.240 --> 30:01.240
But I do want to know kind of from millennials and then compare that like a kind of Kenzie investigation

30:01.240 --> 30:07.240
Like Kenzie, like I want to know like our millennial cousins

30:07.240 --> 30:15.240
Like are they more or less like taboo in the bedroom

30:15.240 --> 30:21.240
Like are they, I mean one person can yell out more, it's Annie in the front

30:21.240 --> 30:30.240
But I know that there's no answer for one generation, but you want to aggregate that data and compare it to people 20 years older

30:30.240 --> 30:34.240
And go like, I don't know how you'd measure it, but I'm just really curious about that sometimes

30:34.240 --> 30:39.240
Because my relationship with Cody, I don't think she'd mind me saying

30:39.240 --> 30:49.240
We go to dark places and we do a lot of characters and there's a lot of narrative work that goes into, and it happens

30:49.240 --> 30:53.240
Do you guys ever do accents, like different dialects and things like that?

30:53.240 --> 30:55.240
Do you know?

30:55.240 --> 30:58.240
Like are you ever like Count Dracula or some shit?

30:58.240 --> 30:59.240
No, but I was

30:59.240 --> 31:01.240
I want to suck your teeth

31:01.240 --> 31:04.240
Do you guys ever do table reads?

31:04.240 --> 31:05.240
What's that?

31:05.240 --> 31:07.240
Do you ever do table reads, some of your best stuff?

31:07.240 --> 31:12.240
Table reads, sorry I meant you repeat your joke 9 times

31:12.240 --> 31:15.240
No, it wasn't worth repeating any of those times, I would say

31:15.240 --> 31:19.240
Can you return Rob Schrab's text?

31:19.240 --> 31:21.240
Answer the question, have you ever done an accent?

31:21.240 --> 31:23.240
Have you ever played like a foreign character?

31:23.240 --> 31:27.240
No, I mean I guess the closest would be I was recently pretty high-ranking Catholic

31:27.240 --> 31:32.240
So I probably have a lot of Italian friends

31:32.240 --> 31:37.240
On that popo shit or that big old

31:37.240 --> 31:39.240
Did you do like an Italian accent?

31:39.240 --> 31:41.240
No, I was just making a joke

31:41.240 --> 31:44.240
Your Fred Stoller impression was pretty good last week, I thought that was pretty good

31:44.240 --> 31:47.240
You should role play as Fred Stoller, that would be amazing

31:47.240 --> 31:50.240
This person says the stream keeps cutting out and they said that 22 minutes ago

31:50.240 --> 31:55.240
But I think it's possible they might be experiencing, we're not starting the show yet, I don't know

31:55.240 --> 31:57.240
Not to be a dick, but the stream keeps cutting out

31:57.240 --> 31:59.240
They might have slow internet

31:59.240 --> 32:04.240
Who's alive tonight? America, why aren't you up on stage yet?

32:04.240 --> 32:07.240
That's Rob Schrab's voice

32:07.240 --> 32:09.240
He's eating carrots

32:09.240 --> 32:13.240
When will you fuck it, I'm eating some carrots, it wouldn't have killed you to return my text

32:19.240 --> 32:23.240
Rob is trolling us from outer space right now?

32:23.240 --> 32:28.240
Please say there's a million from Rob Schrab

32:28.240 --> 32:33.240
I'll look at it, his text is just, here's the thing, Rob's a fucking asshole

32:33.240 --> 32:38.240
Every Thursday we're supposed to hang out, we have it on our schedules

32:38.240 --> 32:43.240
We're old men, we know we're busy, so we only hang out if we schedule it

32:43.240 --> 32:47.240
So we schedule it every Thursday, Harmon and Schrab hang out

32:47.240 --> 32:58.240
So then he goes, I go, you know, we were going to try to catch up on Twin Peaks because I have showtime and he's cheap

32:58.240 --> 33:04.240
And I was like, hey, what about Twin Peaks?

33:04.240 --> 33:08.240
He goes, I thought you cancelled tonight, I said when did you think that?

33:08.240 --> 33:11.240
He says, I got an email saying tonight is cancelled, I'm like what?

33:11.240 --> 33:15.240
And he sends me a screen grab, that's clearly he's just confused

33:15.240 --> 33:19.240
It's like one of those auto emails that gets sent because Levy's schedules are hangouts

33:19.240 --> 33:23.240
And it says updated invitation, weekly Schrab hang

33:23.240 --> 33:28.240
And it's for the following week because I'm going out of town for Cody's mom's birthday

33:28.240 --> 33:33.240
So he sends it, and this is the biggest dick move, even for Schrab

33:33.240 --> 33:37.240
He sends that and you can tell he just saw it as he sends it

33:37.240 --> 33:41.240
So he sees the dates for next week

33:41.240 --> 33:46.240
And then he says, I got this too

33:46.240 --> 33:49.240
But I couldn't decipher it, you see what I'm saying?

33:49.240 --> 33:52.240
He said, I thought you cancelled tonight, I'm like what?

33:52.240 --> 33:54.240
And he's like, how about this?

33:54.240 --> 33:58.240
And he looks at it, that too

33:58.240 --> 34:01.240
But there's no first thing, like he's just a fucking idiot

34:01.240 --> 34:04.240
And I said, all right, whatever, I'll play video games

34:04.240 --> 34:07.240
And he said, AG's coming over if you want to come here

34:07.240 --> 34:11.240
And I said, that email is about next week and when you noticed that you said, I also got this

34:11.240 --> 34:13.240
But I never saw an email canceling tonight

34:13.240 --> 34:17.240
And Schrab said, I deleted it already

34:17.240 --> 34:20.240
Then another text just come over

34:20.240 --> 34:26.240
Then finally a third text, I made a mistake, too late

34:26.240 --> 34:31.240
Then a fourth text, where are you with four question marks?

34:31.240 --> 34:34.240
I won, is what that means

34:34.240 --> 34:38.240
And then AG and I have our pants off, like whatever, you know?

34:38.240 --> 34:46.240
Yeah, well he's just trying to make me miss him by being fun

34:46.240 --> 34:48.240
AG, you want to come up here?

34:48.240 --> 34:50.240
It's TV AG!

35:00.240 --> 35:03.240
We had our shirts off, not our pants

35:03.240 --> 35:06.240
Did you have fun? Because I felt like...

35:06.240 --> 35:08.240
I just started playing video games, I never looked like that

35:08.240 --> 35:11.240
We watched the Mulholland Drive

35:11.240 --> 35:16.240
I said, we're supposed to watch Firewalk with me

35:16.240 --> 35:19.240
Because, you know, that's what David Lynch recommends

35:19.240 --> 35:22.240
If you're going to watch anything to catch up before you start watching Twin Peaks

35:22.240 --> 35:24.240
Watch Firewalk with me

35:24.240 --> 35:28.240
And I said to Schrab, should we watch Firewalk with me first?

35:28.240 --> 35:32.240
And he was like, maybe he wouldn't want me saying that

35:32.240 --> 35:34.240
He's like, Firewalk with me sucks ass

35:34.240 --> 35:37.240
And I was like, so what does that have to do with anything?

35:37.240 --> 35:42.240
So every week should we get together and watch Citizen Kane and then Cheers?

35:42.240 --> 35:46.240
I thought the point was to watch Twin Peaks

35:46.240 --> 35:50.240
David Lynch said, watch Firewalk with me, fucking do it right, you dick

35:50.240 --> 35:52.240
I'm just sick of his bullshit right now

35:52.240 --> 35:54.240
And he fucked up

35:54.240 --> 35:57.240
You gotta read what he's writing to you

35:57.240 --> 35:59.240
What's he writing?

35:59.240 --> 36:02.240
Dan, read a couple of those

36:02.240 --> 36:04.240
I really want you to watch Firewalk with me

36:04.240 --> 36:07.240
It would be a very good thing to do if you're going to watch

36:07.240 --> 36:13.240
I mean, Schrab's saying, Schrab tweeted, will you get me tickets to write said Fred?

36:13.240 --> 36:15.240
He's rhyming, he's rhyming

36:15.240 --> 36:17.240
Will you put toast on my bread?

36:17.240 --> 36:19.240
Will you come visit me on my deathbed?

36:19.240 --> 36:21.240
That was probably the first one

36:21.240 --> 36:23.240
And how do you like them apples?

36:23.240 --> 36:30.240
He hashtagged how?

36:30.240 --> 36:34.240
Are you and Rob Schrab friends in real life?

36:34.240 --> 36:38.240
He's funny when he's not here, it's amazing

36:38.240 --> 36:42.240
At least you know you're getting $5 of Rob's money every month

36:42.240 --> 36:46.240
Who is Dark Man, he's asking now

36:46.240 --> 36:50.240
Why can't you start on time, says Derek, Tuesday sandwich

36:50.240 --> 36:52.240
Who is Dark Man?

36:52.240 --> 36:55.240
It's Liam Neeson, isn't it?

36:55.240 --> 36:59.240
It doesn't matter if your face is bandages on it

36:59.240 --> 37:01.240
Remember that impression?

37:01.240 --> 37:03.240
Oh yeah

37:03.240 --> 37:07.240
Tweetdeck, I'm having a little problem

37:07.240 --> 37:10.240
If anybody can recommend an app that functions like Tweetdeck

37:10.240 --> 37:12.240
What's in my pocket, Schrab is asking

37:12.240 --> 37:14.240
Dan, do you think that in role playing with Cody

37:14.240 --> 37:16.240
You could get away and it would still be sexy

37:16.240 --> 37:18.240
If you were Liam Neeson during the role play?

37:18.240 --> 37:22.240
Yeah, everything's sexy, everything's sexy when you trust someone

37:22.240 --> 37:24.240
And you can go anywhere you want

37:24.240 --> 37:26.240
Can I give you guys assignments like homework

37:26.240 --> 37:29.240
We suggest characters for you guys

37:29.240 --> 37:31.240
You come back next week and see if you guys came

37:31.240 --> 37:33.240
Scene studies

37:33.240 --> 37:35.240
Yeah

37:35.240 --> 37:37.240
I saw somebody had a question about Legs Lavish

37:37.240 --> 37:39.240
My YouTube channel that I watch

37:39.240 --> 37:43.240
Which is about women for women reviewing hosiery

37:43.240 --> 37:46.240
When I lost it

37:46.240 --> 37:48.240
For women you say?

37:48.240 --> 37:50.240
Yeah, you can tell, definitely

37:50.240 --> 37:52.240
It's just women doing hosiery reviews

37:52.240 --> 37:55.240
It's not pornography

37:55.240 --> 37:57.240
Alright, I mean

37:57.240 --> 38:00.240
Are you excited for the mummy remake?

38:00.240 --> 38:05.240
I know they're trying to start up the dark universe

38:05.240 --> 38:07.240
Oh, is that like universal monsters

38:07.240 --> 38:09.240
Like they want to be like Marvel

38:09.240 --> 38:11.240
Like Dracula and the werewolf team

38:11.240 --> 38:14.240
Oh, that reminds me, I gotta check my Mhotep

38:14.240 --> 38:16.240
Check my Marvel Academy

38:20.240 --> 38:22.240
What the fuck?

38:22.240 --> 38:27.240
I go away for five weeks and the show turns to shit

38:27.240 --> 38:29.240
Brandon, what did you let happen up here?

38:29.240 --> 38:33.240
I said we should do whatever you were going to do in your basement

38:33.240 --> 38:36.240
And now this is the running order of the show

38:36.240 --> 38:39.240
We make loops, we play video games

38:39.240 --> 38:41.240
Dan's doing what he would normally do

38:41.240 --> 38:44.240
He's reading tweets, he's playing video games

38:44.240 --> 38:46.240
I never read the dialogue

38:46.240 --> 38:50.240
We're like a month away from you actually just jerking off on stage

38:53.240 --> 38:55.240
Wait, what'd you say?

38:57.240 --> 38:58.240
I'm sorry

38:58.240 --> 39:01.240
I've never seen somebody give a look of why wait a month

39:01.240 --> 39:04.240
One look, why wait a month?

39:08.240 --> 39:10.240
Are you sort of a cookie collector?

39:10.240 --> 39:12.240
What do you guys want to do later?

39:14.240 --> 39:16.240
I guess we lost audio at some point

39:16.240 --> 39:18.240
We also lost the show

39:19.240 --> 39:25.240
Nothing happening, it's just a rich 45 year old just playing video games on stage

39:25.240 --> 39:27.240
Oh, I'm so glad you're back

39:27.240 --> 39:30.240
And he doesn't care, he doesn't know that we're here anymore

39:30.240 --> 39:32.240
He can either see or hear us

39:32.240 --> 39:35.240
Don't you think people tweeting questions is part of a show?

39:35.240 --> 39:39.240
I'm sorry I took a two minute break to check on my Marvel Avengers

39:39.240 --> 39:45.240
characters, like what, I mean it's like a, it's a game, it's like, you know

39:45.240 --> 39:47.240
What about A.G.'s new movie?

39:48.240 --> 39:50.240
Yeah, my movie

39:51.240 --> 39:52.240
My movie

39:53.240 --> 39:56.240
The star of Guardians of the Galaxy 2

39:56.240 --> 39:57.240
Yeah, my movie

39:58.240 --> 39:59.240
A.G.

40:00.240 --> 40:01.240
Thank you

40:01.240 --> 40:03.240
What is, what's Finn Dom?

40:04.240 --> 40:07.240
Finn Dom's where you hire a woman to have all your money

40:07.240 --> 40:14.240
Oh, so is this, is it possible this person is a, well his, his Twitter name is Steven in debt

40:14.240 --> 40:16.240
Yeah, that's his fetish

40:16.240 --> 40:18.240
Dan, I'm worried my fetish is going to ruin my life

40:18.240 --> 40:22.240
Any thoughts, advice for beating an addiction to Finn Dom and similar fets?

40:22.240 --> 40:25.240
Finn Dom seems like a stupid fetish

40:25.240 --> 40:28.240
I mean, but you know that that's a

40:28.240 --> 40:31.240
There's a lot of stupid fetishes

40:31.240 --> 40:34.240
Yeah, but what if that made you come?

40:34.240 --> 40:37.240
What if, what if giving someone all your money made you come? That's what he's saying

40:37.240 --> 40:38.240
I'd be like that's dumb

40:38.240 --> 40:39.240
He's saying

40:40.240 --> 40:43.240
He obviously knows that and so he's crying out for help

40:43.240 --> 40:46.240
Even if he's doing a bit, like this, this person exists hypothetically

40:46.240 --> 40:48.240
Right, no, I think I'd be a lot more

40:48.240 --> 40:50.240
If that were my fetish I'd be a lot more productive

40:50.240 --> 40:52.240
Cause you know, you give all your money away

40:52.240 --> 40:53.240
I gotta get back to work

40:53.240 --> 40:55.240
Yeah, you eventually run out

40:55.240 --> 40:57.240
I wanna come again, I gotta go out there and make that money

40:57.240 --> 40:58.240
Yeah

40:58.240 --> 41:01.240
I would suggest to the person with absolutely no judgment at all

41:01.240 --> 41:05.240
I would say, like, you know, do what you would do

41:05.240 --> 41:08.240
If you were locked in a room

41:08.240 --> 41:12.240
You know, and you couldn't, you couldn't live

41:12.240 --> 41:15.240
Like if, you know, like, like quitting smoking, you know

41:15.240 --> 41:18.240
Like, if you were locked in a room without your cigarettes you wouldn't die

41:18.240 --> 41:20.240
So I guess you just gotta figure out a way

41:20.240 --> 41:21.240
You have to take an action

41:21.240 --> 41:24.240
You're gonna really handcuff yourself to a radiator werewolf style

41:24.240 --> 41:28.240
And you gotta, it's never gonna be the right time to do it

41:28.240 --> 41:31.240
Like, I got off the elliptical and I'm never gonna get back on

41:31.240 --> 41:33.240
Until I just do it at the wrong time

41:33.240 --> 41:39.240
You gotta tell those young ladies on your chat window

41:39.240 --> 41:43.240
No, you cannot have my money and I refuse to talk about it

41:43.240 --> 41:45.240
And even give it back

41:45.240 --> 41:47.240
Here's a pitch, we bring your elliptical to the show

41:47.240 --> 41:49.240
You do 20 minutes of the show on the elliptical

41:49.240 --> 41:51.240
Oh my god, that's a great idea

41:51.240 --> 41:53.240
That's not a great idea

41:53.240 --> 41:54.240
Spencer doesn't

41:54.240 --> 41:57.240
You guys don't understand what it involves to move that elliptical places

41:57.240 --> 41:59.240
Yeah, Spencer's gonna be the one moving that

41:59.240 --> 42:00.240
Yeah

42:00.240 --> 42:02.240
Alright, well, so anyways

42:02.240 --> 42:05.240
I'll buy a new elliptical to have here so we can watch it work out

42:05.240 --> 42:07.240
There's an idea

42:07.240 --> 42:11.240
Let's see, I mean, look, I mean, I'm not the one that...

42:11.240 --> 42:13.240
I'm happy to talk about lots of stuff

42:13.240 --> 42:14.240
I got some movie recommends

42:14.240 --> 42:16.240
I don't feel at home in this world anymore

42:16.240 --> 42:18.240
Check it out on Netflix

42:18.240 --> 42:22.240
What is this thing, these branches going off of...

42:22.240 --> 42:23.240
It's a mind map

42:23.240 --> 42:24.240
This app's called iThoughts

42:24.240 --> 42:26.240
I'm not sold on it right away

42:26.240 --> 42:29.240
But also watch sneakers, it's a 90s movie

42:29.240 --> 42:32.240
It'll make you feel better

42:32.240 --> 42:34.240
No, it won't, it'll make you feel sad

42:34.240 --> 42:36.240
Well, because it's like, there's no internet yet

42:36.240 --> 42:38.240
But it's like about hacking and it's fun

42:38.240 --> 42:40.240
And there's a Russian guy in it that's like

42:40.240 --> 42:42.240
Oh, it's crazy that the Cold War is over

42:42.240 --> 42:44.240
And you just want to kill yourself

42:44.240 --> 42:46.240
And River Phoenix is in it

42:46.240 --> 42:48.240
So here's the thing, I was watching it

42:48.240 --> 42:51.240
I was like, god damn, you know all due respect

42:51.240 --> 42:53.240
To everyone in Tinseltown

42:53.240 --> 42:55.240
I hope this isn't ghoulish

42:55.240 --> 42:59.240
But for real, after River Phoenix died

42:59.240 --> 43:02.240
You know DiCaprio's agent called DiCaprio

43:02.240 --> 43:04.240
And it was like, River Phoenix died

43:04.240 --> 43:07.240
And DiCaprio was like, ah, bummer

43:07.240 --> 43:09.240
What do you got for me?

43:09.240 --> 43:11.240
You know, like...

43:11.240 --> 43:14.240
So what do you think, Gilbert Grape?

43:14.240 --> 43:17.240
It's like, you know, come on man

43:17.240 --> 43:20.240
River Phoenix dying was good for DiCaprio

43:20.240 --> 43:22.240
Is my thesis

43:22.240 --> 43:26.240
Do you think DiCaprio murdered him?

43:26.240 --> 43:28.240
No, I wouldn't go that far, I just think

43:28.240 --> 43:31.240
You know, it's weird when life puts you sometimes

43:31.240 --> 43:33.240
In the position of cheering someone's death

43:33.240 --> 43:35.240
Did you see the keepers?

43:35.240 --> 43:38.240
Yes, I've been watching the keepers

43:38.240 --> 43:40.240
It's a bummer

43:40.240 --> 43:42.240
No, I mean, it's insane

43:42.240 --> 43:44.240
It's crazy

43:44.240 --> 43:46.240
So we've stood up here numerous times

43:46.240 --> 43:48.240
We all hate the kids

43:48.240 --> 43:50.240
We particularly hate the teenagers

43:50.240 --> 43:52.240
We think they're entitled

43:52.240 --> 43:54.240
We were...

43:54.240 --> 43:57.240
Dino and I were in the back of a lift

43:57.240 --> 44:00.240
And there was a crossing guard

44:00.240 --> 44:02.240
There were kids going across the crosswalk

44:02.240 --> 44:04.240
And then somehow the lift driver

44:04.240 --> 44:06.240
Ended up...

44:06.240 --> 44:08.240
By mistake, like, he ended up

44:08.240 --> 44:10.240
His car was blocking the crosswalk

44:10.240 --> 44:12.240
It wasn't because he wasn't looking

44:12.240 --> 44:14.240
And plowed into kids

44:14.240 --> 44:16.240
It was because of the ebb and flow

44:16.240 --> 44:18.240
Of crosswalkingness

44:18.240 --> 44:20.240
He's stuck at a stop sign

44:20.240 --> 44:22.240
And he's in the middle of the crosswalk

44:22.240 --> 44:24.240
And this 10-year-old kid

44:24.240 --> 44:26.240
Comes up to the backseat window of the lift

44:26.240 --> 44:29.240
And knocks on the window that Dino's at

44:29.240 --> 44:32.240
And just has this adorable smile on his face

44:32.240 --> 44:34.240
But he's being a cock

44:34.240 --> 44:36.240
Like, Dino rolls down

44:36.240 --> 44:38.240
And goes, can I help you?

44:38.240 --> 44:40.240
He's like, can I help you?

44:40.240 --> 44:42.240
Whoa!

44:42.240 --> 44:44.240
And luckily he got Dino and not me

44:44.240 --> 44:46.240
Because I'd be in jail right now

44:46.240 --> 44:48.240
Because I don't know what I would have said

44:48.240 --> 44:50.240
I probably would have escalated

44:50.240 --> 44:52.240
But Dino was like, it's like

44:52.240 --> 44:54.240
You can walk around the car

44:54.240 --> 44:56.240
I believe in you

44:56.240 --> 44:58.240
And he's like, I shouldn't have to

44:58.240 --> 45:00.240
And he's like, you can do it

45:00.240 --> 45:02.240
Good boy, good boy

45:02.240 --> 45:04.240
And you hear him in the distance go, don't call me boy

45:04.240 --> 45:06.240
He was Indian, by the way

45:06.240 --> 45:08.240
Like...

45:08.240 --> 45:10.240
Well, don't bury the lead then

45:10.240 --> 45:12.240
Just to make sure you know

45:12.240 --> 45:14.240
Fuckin' Indian children, wow

45:14.240 --> 45:16.240
I'm including that at the end

45:16.240 --> 45:18.240
Because Dino said boy

45:18.240 --> 45:20.240
And he said, don't call me boy

45:20.240 --> 45:22.240
Which is like

45:22.240 --> 45:24.240
His race became important at that point

45:24.240 --> 45:26.240
In my opinion

45:26.240 --> 45:28.240
Because it's like, wait a minute, what the fuck

45:28.240 --> 45:30.240
Shit head, fucking shit head

45:30.240 --> 45:32.240
Anyways, so that's how we feel about kids

45:32.240 --> 45:34.240
We don't like them, we all agree, bad batch

45:34.240 --> 45:36.240
No way, but we like

45:36.240 --> 45:38.240
We like those kids though

45:38.240 --> 45:40.240
Because we grow up to be those kids

45:40.240 --> 45:42.240
Like, that little smart mouth motherfucker

45:42.240 --> 45:44.240
Was great

45:44.240 --> 45:46.240
Like he had a running bit already on the street

45:46.240 --> 45:48.240
That he was willing to fuck with adults on

45:48.240 --> 45:50.240
Like he's a future Dan Harmon

45:50.240 --> 45:52.240
Well, I

45:52.240 --> 45:54.240
I hope so

45:54.240 --> 45:56.240
But I have a feeling that he's a future Donald Trump

45:56.240 --> 45:58.240
Because he's like, oh

45:58.240 --> 46:00.240
A system exists by which I can just yell at people

46:00.240 --> 46:02.240
It's illegal to hit me

46:02.240 --> 46:04.240
I think I'll just wag my dick around

46:04.240 --> 46:06.240
Bling, bling, bling

46:06.240 --> 46:08.240
Like, but here's the thing

46:08.240 --> 46:10.240
This was all a downbeat to my

46:10.240 --> 46:12.240
Lifting about this, we all shake our canes

46:12.240 --> 46:14.240
These kids, they suck, oh, they're so fucking shitty

46:14.240 --> 46:16.240
And they're, you know, they know it's illegal

46:16.240 --> 46:18.240
To hit them now, and they're just taking advantage of it

46:18.240 --> 46:20.240
If you watch

46:20.240 --> 46:22.240
The Keepers on Netflix, which takes, you know

46:22.240 --> 46:24.240
It's like, this nun

46:24.240 --> 46:26.240
Disappears, they find her body, and then it all

46:26.240 --> 46:28.240
Like straights down in court, this horribleness

46:28.240 --> 46:30.240
Is happening within the Catholic high school

46:30.240 --> 46:32.240
And it's just

46:32.240 --> 46:34.240
Like episode after episode

46:34.240 --> 46:36.240
Story after story of you can't

46:36.240 --> 46:38.240
Believe, it sounds like a parallel dimension

46:38.240 --> 46:40.240
The shit that people were getting away

46:40.240 --> 46:42.240
With abusing these kids

46:42.240 --> 46:44.240
These kids are pubescent girls

46:44.240 --> 46:46.240
In an all girls Catholic school

46:46.240 --> 46:48.240
And I was uplifted

46:48.240 --> 46:50.240
And I was talking to somebody about this

46:50.240 --> 46:52.240
The other day, because they were griping about today's kids

46:52.240 --> 46:54.240
You know, like, oh

46:54.240 --> 46:56.240
And I was like, yeah, but

46:56.240 --> 46:58.240
If these kids, like

46:58.240 --> 47:00.240
That Keepers shit, it's impossible

47:00.240 --> 47:02.240
Now, like you can't

47:04.240 --> 47:06.240
Today's 13-year-old

47:06.240 --> 47:08.240
Is gonna go into a priest's office

47:08.240 --> 47:10.240
And

47:10.240 --> 47:12.240
Believe they should just drink a soda

47:12.240 --> 47:14.240
And talk about what a slut they are

47:14.240 --> 47:16.240
And not think it's gonna

47:16.240 --> 47:18.240
You know, they're gonna, that entitlement

47:18.240 --> 47:20.240
That we're complaining about and stuff

47:20.240 --> 47:22.240
It's like, there's a, like

47:22.240 --> 47:24.240
Where did the obedience get us?

47:24.240 --> 47:26.240
Where did the respect for elders

47:26.240 --> 47:28.240
Like, it's always

47:28.240 --> 47:30.240
Six to one-and-a-half a dozen

47:30.240 --> 47:32.240
Like, when you watch The Keepers

47:32.240 --> 47:34.240
You just wish Ariana Grande fans

47:34.240 --> 47:36.240
The office and go like, I'm entitled

47:36.240 --> 47:38.240
Because it would be the end of everything

47:38.240 --> 47:40.240
And instead, this thing goes on and on

47:40.240 --> 47:42.240
For so long that you're just watching

47:42.240 --> 47:44.240
Old people watch

47:44.240 --> 47:46.240
The snow fall over the footprints of their abuse

47:46.240 --> 47:48.240
That took, that was so severe

47:48.240 --> 47:50.240
It took them their entire life

47:50.240 --> 47:52.240
Before they could even remember it

47:52.240 --> 47:54.240
Then talk about it, then

47:54.240 --> 47:56.240
Find each other on Facebook

47:56.240 --> 47:58.240
Then be told by everyone

47:58.240 --> 48:00.240
Go fuck yourself, you took too long to remember it

48:00.240 --> 48:02.240
Anyways, so the good old days

48:02.240 --> 48:04.240
Weren't that good

48:04.240 --> 48:06.240
It is, by the way, a tenet of fascism

48:06.240 --> 48:08.240
From everybody that studies it

48:08.240 --> 48:10.240
These illusions to a mysterious

48:10.240 --> 48:12.240
Amorphous, unsighted

48:12.240 --> 48:14.240
Golden age

48:14.240 --> 48:16.240
Make America great again

48:16.240 --> 48:18.240
Everything was great at some point

48:18.240 --> 48:20.240
You'll never be able to get out of a fascist

48:20.240 --> 48:22.240
The actual documentation

48:22.240 --> 48:24.240
Of when it was so fucking great

48:24.240 --> 48:26.240
They love to talk about

48:26.240 --> 48:28.240
Like, it's like comic book golden age

48:28.240 --> 48:30.240
Or something, like, oh, remember when things

48:30.240 --> 48:32.240
Remember when you were six

48:32.240 --> 48:34.240
And you thought fucking Santa was real

48:34.240 --> 48:36.240
That's what you're talking about

48:36.240 --> 48:38.240
You want to get back to when you were six

48:38.240 --> 48:40.240
Fucking bloated windbag

48:40.240 --> 48:42.240
You shitty murderous, horrible

48:42.240 --> 48:44.240
I didn't

48:44.240 --> 48:46.240
Yeah

48:46.240 --> 48:48.240
And by the way, politically

48:48.240 --> 48:50.240
Let's check in on my politics

48:50.240 --> 48:52.240
Ask me where I'm at politically

48:52.240 --> 48:54.240
Dan, politics corner

48:54.240 --> 48:56.240
I'm back

48:56.240 --> 48:58.240
To every man for himself

48:58.240 --> 49:00.240
I hate everybody, sorry if that's demoralizing

49:00.240 --> 49:02.240
That's been Politics Corner

49:02.240 --> 49:04.240
Brought to you by Gold Bond Footpowder

49:04.240 --> 49:06.240
Gold Bond

49:06.240 --> 49:08.240
Powder for your feet

49:08.240 --> 49:10.240
I'll swing back

49:10.240 --> 49:12.240
But don't, I'm

49:12.240 --> 49:14.240
Curly, I'm just in this mood, Curly

49:14.240 --> 49:16.240
I don't believe in liberalism

49:16.240 --> 49:18.240
I don't believe in Democrats

49:18.240 --> 49:20.240
I'm back to one of those douchebags

49:20.240 --> 49:22.240
That's stating on the sidelines going, fuck you

49:22.240 --> 49:24.240
I'm just thinking, I'm like

49:24.240 --> 49:26.240
I just can't, I just feel like

49:26.240 --> 49:28.240
It just, come on

49:28.240 --> 49:30.240
Everyone's fucking dumb, everyone's dumb

49:30.240 --> 49:32.240
We know everyone's dumb, the average IQ is

49:32.240 --> 49:34.240
185% of every group of anyone

49:34.240 --> 49:36.240
Is a fucking moron that can't

49:36.240 --> 49:38.240
Make a decision for themselves, they say the dumbest

49:38.240 --> 49:40.240
Shit, like, we're just

49:40.240 --> 49:42.240
It's just the species that's run its course

49:42.240 --> 49:44.240
And we gotta get to the moon

49:44.240 --> 49:46.240
Or I gotta get out of here, I gotta dig a hole in the desert

49:46.240 --> 49:48.240
Just go down like mine

49:48.240 --> 49:50.240
What happened to the moon?

49:50.240 --> 49:52.240
You dropped that premise like after episode 3

49:52.240 --> 49:54.240
I think

49:54.240 --> 49:56.240
Church and I went to the March for Truth

49:56.240 --> 49:58.240
In LA yesterday

49:58.240 --> 50:00.240
And we were leaving the march

50:00.240 --> 50:02.240
And there's always like 6 or 8

50:02.240 --> 50:04.240
Pro-Trump people on a corner

50:04.240 --> 50:06.240
Usually completely surrounded by police

50:06.240 --> 50:08.240
Where you're not even allowed to get close to them

50:08.240 --> 50:10.240
Because they're afraid of what might happen

50:10.240 --> 50:12.240
But yesterday, for some reason

50:12.240 --> 50:14.240
You could walk up to them

50:14.240 --> 50:16.240
They had like a microphone and a speaker

50:16.240 --> 50:18.240
And it was a guy dressed like

50:18.240 --> 50:20.240
He had like

50:20.240 --> 50:22.240
The old nickerbagger plus 4

50:22.240 --> 50:24.240
Wait, so he wanted you to connect

50:24.240 --> 50:26.240
Those dots like the American dream

50:26.240 --> 50:28.240
He had a whole beat up tricorn hat

50:28.240 --> 50:30.240
And he looked like homeless

50:30.240 --> 50:32.240
Ben Franklin

50:32.240 --> 50:34.240
And he was like, everyone wants to talk

50:34.240 --> 50:36.240
You can come over and talk to us

50:36.240 --> 50:38.240
A penny stolen is a penny stolen

50:42.240 --> 50:44.240
Homeless Ben Franklin jokes

50:44.240 --> 50:46.240
Is that what he was going?

50:46.240 --> 50:48.240
But there was Make America Great Again banners

50:48.240 --> 50:50.240
And there was a lot of, you know

50:50.240 --> 50:52.240
Why would I have a key? I don't have a house

50:52.240 --> 50:54.240
If I tried to discover

51:00.240 --> 51:02.240
But I know we're derailing you

51:02.240 --> 51:04.240
Are you sure this guy was conservative?

51:04.240 --> 51:06.240
Oh yeah, he was

51:06.240 --> 51:08.240
But he was being pretty cool because he was engaging

51:08.240 --> 51:10.240
People were like, if you want to come up here

51:10.240 --> 51:12.240
I'll give you the microphone, we can have a discussion

51:12.240 --> 51:14.240
It turns out mostly

51:14.240 --> 51:16.240
They shout you down about what you think

51:16.240 --> 51:18.240
Because they're surrounded by

51:18.240 --> 51:20.240
Locker up and

51:20.240 --> 51:22.240
Hillary is evil

51:22.240 --> 51:24.240
Kind of posters, they're still on that thing

51:24.240 --> 51:26.240
But Church at the center

51:26.240 --> 51:28.240
This is amazing, I should probably talk about it

51:28.240 --> 51:30.240
Like she wants to, but she had this conversation

51:30.240 --> 51:32.240
With this woman who had an American Indian

51:32.240 --> 51:34.240
Drum

51:34.240 --> 51:36.240
And she had a Trump-Pence 2020

51:36.240 --> 51:38.240
Shirt and hat on

51:38.240 --> 51:40.240
But she didn't vote for Trump

51:40.240 --> 51:42.240
But she thinks that it was better

51:42.240 --> 51:44.240
Having this hour-long conversation

51:44.240 --> 51:46.240
With her, she came away with

51:46.240 --> 51:48.240
It was really uplifting

51:48.240 --> 51:50.240
But surrounded by people that can actually talk

51:50.240 --> 51:52.240
And one of the upshots of it

51:52.240 --> 51:54.240
Was the woman said, you know what, this conversation

51:54.240 --> 51:56.240
Makes me feel like I should call up some of my friends

51:56.240 --> 51:58.240
That I don't talk to anymore

51:58.240 --> 52:00.240
Because I don't feel like I can

52:00.240 --> 52:02.240
Because we're so different, the gulf between what I believe

52:02.240 --> 52:04.240
And what you believe is so unbridgeable

52:04.240 --> 52:06.240
But there was another guy pacing around

52:06.240 --> 52:08.240
And he had goggles on

52:08.240 --> 52:10.240
And an American flag bandana

52:10.240 --> 52:12.240
And a helmet

52:12.240 --> 52:14.240
And like military, like

52:14.240 --> 52:16.240
Flak jacket kind of stuff on and carrying a flag

52:16.240 --> 52:18.240
And just pacing around mad-dogging everybody

52:18.240 --> 52:20.240
Clearly looking for a fight

52:20.240 --> 52:22.240
So like you have people that really do want to have a discussion

52:22.240 --> 52:24.240
Surrounded by people that are clearly cruising

52:24.240 --> 52:26.240
For a bruising

52:26.240 --> 52:28.240
With a guy in Portland, like it's just

52:28.240 --> 52:30.240
He was just this, I mean

52:30.240 --> 52:32.240
And there was this one kid, like college-age looking dude

52:32.240 --> 52:34.240
And he had a big sign that said

52:34.240 --> 52:36.240
Stop the hate, let's debate

52:36.240 --> 52:38.240
And I walked by him and said, hey, you want to just talk?

52:38.240 --> 52:40.240
I'm like, not really, I mean

52:40.240 --> 52:42.240
It's hot out, so I want to go have lunch

52:42.240 --> 52:44.240
You know?

52:44.240 --> 52:46.240
And I'm pretty sure

52:46.240 --> 52:48.240
We're not going to convince each other of anything

52:48.240 --> 52:50.240
And he was like, no, I just feel like

52:50.240 --> 52:52.240
It shouldn't be about shouting, it should be a conversation

52:52.240 --> 52:54.240
We should be able to talk about the difference

52:54.240 --> 52:56.240
I totally agree with that

52:56.240 --> 52:58.240
I appreciate you guys being out here

52:58.240 --> 53:00.240
And doing that, like hooray for you

53:00.240 --> 53:02.240
Then I saw him a little later on

53:02.240 --> 53:04.240
And he held his sign up

53:04.240 --> 53:06.240
And underneath his stop the hate, let's debate sign

53:06.240 --> 53:08.240
I will post this photo because he's a douchebag

53:10.240 --> 53:12.240
When he lifted his thing up

53:12.240 --> 53:14.240
His shirt said, Hillary sucks

53:14.240 --> 53:16.240
Not like Monica though, or something like that

53:16.240 --> 53:18.240
I'm like, oh really?

53:18.240 --> 53:20.240
So I went up and said, hey, can I get a picture of you?

53:20.240 --> 53:22.240
And he goes, yeah, and he holds his sign up

53:22.240 --> 53:24.240
I wanted to get a picture of your awesome misogyny shirt

53:24.240 --> 53:26.240
And he goes, what? I love that

53:26.240 --> 53:28.240
Underneath your stop the hate sign

53:28.240 --> 53:30.240
You proudly admit you hate women

53:30.240 --> 53:32.240
He goes, oh, oh, oh, oh

53:32.240 --> 53:34.240
I'm like Charlie Callas

53:34.240 --> 53:36.240
Oh, good to see

53:36.240 --> 53:38.240
The high-roaded party

53:38.240 --> 53:40.240
Of the emotional left

53:40.240 --> 53:42.240
Is so sensitive to my needs

53:42.240 --> 53:44.240
Oh, good to show you true colors

53:44.240 --> 53:46.240
I'm so fucking sick of that

53:46.240 --> 53:48.240
These people are not going to reward

53:48.240 --> 53:50.240
Our fucking, like, we're the trolls

53:50.240 --> 53:52.240
Now we should be angry

53:52.240 --> 53:54.240
And they should go fuck themselves

53:54.240 --> 53:56.240
I hate that they switch gears

53:56.240 --> 53:58.240
To this, like, they're trolling us

53:58.240 --> 54:00.240
They don't really want to

54:00.240 --> 54:02.240
I like that there was a gang

54:02.240 --> 54:04.240
Of people out there going, hey, let's debate

54:04.240 --> 54:06.240
Because what I think

54:06.240 --> 54:08.240
That means is that they're on the fucking ropes

54:08.240 --> 54:10.240
Psychologically, just them

54:10.240 --> 54:12.240
That they've run out of ways

54:12.240 --> 54:14.240
To feel like they're part of a group

54:14.240 --> 54:16.240
And now they're so lonely

54:16.240 --> 54:18.240
And people have gotten so good

54:18.240 --> 54:20.240
At walking by them that they're like

54:20.240 --> 54:22.240
What about discourse?

54:22.240 --> 54:24.240
Ha, ha, ha, ha

54:24.240 --> 54:26.240
Okay

54:26.240 --> 54:28.240
You guys always want to talk, right?

54:28.240 --> 54:30.240
Intellectual, let's have a conversation

54:30.240 --> 54:32.240
Um, okay

54:32.240 --> 54:34.240
What are you saying?

54:34.240 --> 54:36.240
RETURN

54:36.240 --> 54:38.240
These people are dumb

54:38.240 --> 54:40.240
They're dumb

54:40.240 --> 54:42.240
And you know they're dumb when they speak

54:42.240 --> 54:44.240
Because they don't know how to put thoughts together

54:44.240 --> 54:46.240
And when you say things to them

54:46.240 --> 54:48.240
Like, that sounds like

54:48.240 --> 54:50.240
You don't know that America

54:50.240 --> 54:52.240
Isn't two million years old

54:52.240 --> 54:54.240
Um, they say

54:54.240 --> 54:56.240
See, it's that kind of attitude

54:56.240 --> 54:58.240
That's seen its day

54:58.240 --> 55:00.240
You know, like it's always

55:00.240 --> 55:02.240
It's an anti-intellectual revolution

55:02.240 --> 55:04.240
And so there is no conversation

55:04.240 --> 55:06.240
They're

55:06.240 --> 55:08.240
Ugly, mean, nasty,

55:08.240 --> 55:10.240
Brutish, thuggish, selfish

55:10.240 --> 55:12.240
I got a boo-boo

55:12.240 --> 55:14.240
It's everyone else's problem people

55:14.240 --> 55:16.240
I got a fucking boo-boo, motherfucker

55:16.240 --> 55:18.240
I pay taxes

55:18.240 --> 55:20.240
I pay everyone's taxes

55:20.240 --> 55:22.240
I'm a one percenter

55:22.240 --> 55:24.240
It's hard for me

55:24.240 --> 55:26.240
Get out the world's biggest

55:26.240 --> 55:28.240
Violin for me

55:28.240 --> 55:30.240
You're paying for it

55:30.240 --> 55:32.240
Your tax dollars go to tiny

55:32.240 --> 55:34.240
Violins all over the world

55:34.240 --> 55:36.240
It's just like, Louis C.K. had this thing

55:36.240 --> 55:38.240
Where he was like, by the way, voting

55:38.240 --> 55:40.240
Voting is like, it's not, you're not supposed to wait

55:40.240 --> 55:42.240
For the candidate that's like

55:42.240 --> 55:44.240
You know, like, oh

55:44.240 --> 55:46.240
That's what we're suffering from

55:46.240 --> 55:48.240
I was reading this thing by Noam Chomsky

55:48.240 --> 55:50.240
But most things by Chomsky I probably didn't understand it

55:50.240 --> 55:52.240
I have to read it five more times

55:52.240 --> 55:54.240
But we're talking about this thing

55:54.240 --> 55:56.240
It's this bag of potatoes principle

55:56.240 --> 55:58.240
Where

55:58.240 --> 56:00.240
Individualism

56:00.240 --> 56:02.240
Hyperbole where it's like

56:02.240 --> 56:04.240
You kind of count on the impoverished

56:04.240 --> 56:06.240
You play up to everything that divides them

56:06.240 --> 56:08.240
Even down to the individual

56:08.240 --> 56:10.240
Not just racially, not just religiously

56:10.240 --> 56:12.240
And gender and all that stuff

56:12.240 --> 56:14.240
But also, you kind of encourage this sort of like

56:14.240 --> 56:16.240
Oh, democracy means that you as an individual

56:16.240 --> 56:18.240
Should be able to put your feet up

56:18.240 --> 56:20.240
And eat potato chips, and if anything gets in your way

56:20.240 --> 56:22.240
You should be able to complain about it

56:22.240 --> 56:24.240
And that's a weapon that conservatives

56:24.240 --> 56:26.240
Use

56:26.240 --> 56:28.240
To make stupid people go

56:28.240 --> 56:30.240
Wait, oh, the air conditioning

56:30.240 --> 56:32.240
Changed a little bit

56:32.240 --> 56:34.240
It's 9-11

56:34.240 --> 56:36.240
It's 9-11

56:40.240 --> 56:42.240
Yeah, it was good not to cut off there

56:42.240 --> 56:44.240
It's 9-11, which is where

56:44.240 --> 56:46.240
We've decided to take an act break in our show

56:46.240 --> 56:48.240
Yeah, we're going to use that now as an organic time

56:48.240 --> 56:50.240
To stop and take an act break

56:50.240 --> 56:52.240
And announce the fact

56:52.240 --> 56:54.240
We are now officially going to start

56:54.240 --> 56:56.240
Our D&D campaign

56:56.240 --> 56:58.240
Our Pathfinder campaign

57:02.240 --> 57:04.240
But

57:04.240 --> 57:06.240
You kind of did that in the wrong order

57:06.240 --> 57:08.240
The 9-11 is a reminder

57:08.240 --> 57:10.240
That we go to a word from our sponsor

57:10.240 --> 57:12.240
For people who listen to the podcast for free

57:12.240 --> 57:14.240
Do you guys know what Fulton and Rourke is?

57:14.240 --> 57:16.240
A full mitt Rourke?

57:16.240 --> 57:18.240
Fulton and Rourke is a premier

57:18.240 --> 57:20.240
Men's

57:20.240 --> 57:22.240
Toiletry service

57:22.240 --> 57:24.240
That's specialized in wax based cologne

57:24.240 --> 57:26.240
And

57:26.240 --> 57:28.240
Body wash for men

57:28.240 --> 57:30.240
Well, now you're confusing people, because what we're going to do is take an act break

57:30.240 --> 57:32.240
And

57:34.240 --> 57:36.240
What we're going to do is take an act break

57:36.240 --> 57:38.240
That the feral audio people could identify

57:38.240 --> 57:40.240
Where they would put the volume down and play one of those mid-roll ads

57:40.240 --> 57:42.240
Oh, I thought you were telling the audience the ads

57:44.240 --> 57:46.240
That was a special treat

57:46.240 --> 57:48.240
It's 9-12 now

57:48.240 --> 57:50.240
Did that ship sail?

57:50.240 --> 57:52.240
So here's what we're going to do

57:52.240 --> 57:54.240
It's 9-11

57:54.240 --> 57:56.240
So we're going to take a break here

57:56.240 --> 57:58.240
During which the people who listen to the podcast

57:58.240 --> 58:00.240
For free are going to listen

58:00.240 --> 58:02.240
To a pre-rolled ad

58:02.240 --> 58:04.240
During that ad

58:04.240 --> 58:06.240
That you're listening to at home for free

58:06.240 --> 58:08.240
Or on your subway or where you're cutting your carrots

58:08.240 --> 58:10.240
In the front lawn

58:10.240 --> 58:12.240
The people that are here live

58:12.240 --> 58:14.240
And the people that pay $5 a month

58:14.240 --> 58:16.240
Are going to experience an exclusive

58:16.240 --> 58:18.240
Harmontown experience

58:18.240 --> 58:20.240
It's called a solid gold blow job machine

58:26.240 --> 58:28.240
So right now

58:28.240 --> 58:30.240
Already

58:30.240 --> 58:32.240
The people that can hear the sound of my voice right now

58:32.240 --> 58:34.240
If you didn't pay for this

58:34.240 --> 58:36.240
There's been a mistake

58:38.240 --> 58:40.240
Because you're now in the ad free zone

58:40.240 --> 58:42.240
The exclusive

58:42.240 --> 58:44.240
Exclusive

58:44.240 --> 58:46.240
So roomy

58:46.240 --> 58:48.240
Luxurious

58:48.240 --> 58:50.240
It's so comfortable

58:50.240 --> 58:52.240
It's like wearing me undies

58:52.240 --> 58:54.240
We should monetize the ad free zone

58:54.240 --> 58:56.240
If it becomes

58:56.240 --> 58:58.240
But also it's a great time to show pictures

58:58.240 --> 59:00.240
Or play some songs

59:00.240 --> 59:10.240
Yeah, write a song for us, Dan.

59:10.240 --> 59:12.240
Right?

59:12.240 --> 59:14.240
See this one still needs to go

59:22.240 --> 59:26.240
What if you slow it down?

59:26.240 --> 59:28.240
Like

59:28.240 --> 59:30.240
Considerably

59:36.240 --> 59:38.240
I'm just talking about the whole music making process

59:38.240 --> 59:40.240
Are you about to do a slow jam for us?

59:42.240 --> 59:44.240
Just imagine those podcast fuckers

59:44.240 --> 59:46.240
Missing out on this

59:46.240 --> 59:48.240
Are we in the ad free zone or are we back?

59:48.240 --> 59:50.240
I hope so

59:50.240 --> 59:52.240
It's nice, right?

59:52.240 --> 59:54.240
It's a little more manageable

59:54.240 --> 59:56.240
Yeah

59:56.240 --> 59:58.240
I don't know

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.240
Dan doesn't like it

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.240
Sounds like graduation music

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.240
Yeah

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.240
That vitamin C song

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.240
Jeff Bryan Davis

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.240
Did you guys

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.240
I don't want to sound

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.240
Defensive or tyrannical

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.240
But did you guys

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.240
Have been complaining the whole time

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.240
About how the show's going

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.240
And what's happening in the show

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.240
Have anything for the people that could be special?

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.240
Like did you want to share anything

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.240
With anybody?

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.240
Like what did you do

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.240
Where were you, Jeff?

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.240
I was doing

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.240
I traveled all over the country

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.240
With Ryan Stiles, Greg Proops, Jill Murray, and Bob Durkatch

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.240
We did comedy for people

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.240
It was very fun, whose life anyways

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.240
It's a good show

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.240
I mean, sarcastically, good thing

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.240
Nobody's missing that

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.240
Yeah, you know, I didn't go anywhere last week at all

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.240
Yes, you did, you went to some sort of Pathfinder

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.240
Affair

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.240
No, no, I was hunting whales

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.240
Did you catch any?

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.240
Yeah, I murdered three

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.240
And as the life

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.240
Was being squeezed out of their

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.240
Supple necks, I was just imagining

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.240
Them as all the fans

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.240
She just listened to the podcast

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.240
Just murdering the fans

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.240
I didn't even know whales had necks

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.240
Yeah, oh, they do

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.240
They're hard to strangle but

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.240
It's the hardest way to kill a whale

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.240
Like you have to hate whales so much

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.240
Well, we were doing it for sport, of course

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.240
Yeah, and it's easy to hate whales

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.240
When you think of them as your fans

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.240
You could kill a whale with a harpoon

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.240
Or with a bomb, but you have to

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.240
Fucking hate whales to get in the water

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.240
With them and just try to strangle them

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.240
Then we got raided by Interpol

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.240
Because of all this

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.240
Conflict ivory that we had on board

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.240
It was a real situation

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.240
Yeah, you're giving poachers a bad name

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.240
You're one of those bad poachers

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.240
Yeah, I talked our way out of it

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.240
I floated the head Interpol guy

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.240
A dress made of puppies

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.240
Yes!

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.240
And he led me off with a warning

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.240
Yes, that deserves

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.240
That's all the things we referenced

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.240
And we're back

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.240
Come on

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.240
That is some insane recall

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.240
Right there, well done

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.240
That was amazing

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.240
I wish people could hear

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.240
You guys missed something

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.240
If you don't pay five bucks a month

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.240
There's callbacks to other shows that happen

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.240
Let's all put our pants back on

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.240
And get back to the show

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.240
That was so chilling

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.240
This has been a long delay

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.240
Unless getting into the

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.240
D&D thing

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.240
So we're not going to

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.240
Do actual gameplay this episode

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.240
That's going to be the next episode

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.240
Hold on

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.240
One thing we're going to establish

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.240
About the D&D thing is

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.240
We're going to do it earlier in the show

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.240
About halfway through

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.240
So we're hopefully a little more sober

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.240
We're going to keep it consistent

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.240
We're looking at how to

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.240
Spiral out of control

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.240
We're just going to have

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.240
People that are always

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.240
Able to do the show

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.240
Doing the characters

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.240
We're not going to start doing the rotating guests

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.240
And Spencer's going to

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.240
Always call the shots

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.240
We have to respect his authority

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.240
As Dungeon Master

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.240
Both in terms of

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.240
Out of game

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.240
And in game

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.240
So that's why

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.240
I now hand it over to you

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.240
To explain what we're doing

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.240
This week

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.240
You should have played that graduation music

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.240
We're gathered here today

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.240
So we have your characters

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.240
I have your character's sheets

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.240
I thought we should talk about your backgrounds

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.240
And come up with your shared backstory

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.240
As kind of a fun exercise

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.240
So that when we start

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.240
You kind of have some sense

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.240
Of your history together

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.240
Does that make sense?

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.240
What is your character's racing class?

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.240
It's a great question

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.240
It's like a quiz

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.240
I have to know it now

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.240
You haven't thought about your character?

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.240
I haven't thought about this in a while

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.240
We kept pushing it off

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.240
My character together

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.240
I know what my spells are

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.240
You're very proactive

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.240
I'm a human cleric, you dick

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.240
I did forget

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.240
What's your character's name?

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.240
Is that blank so far?

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.240
No, that's part of what we gotta come up with

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.240
Okay

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.240
I'm gonna let that sit

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.240
Can I see my sheet

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.240
Or is there anything I should...

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.240
No, there's nothing

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.240
This is what we're trying to figure out

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.240
I showed you guys these earlier

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.240
When we weren't on stage

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.240
But you seemed busy

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.240
Should we get Steve?

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.240
Oh yeah, because we're gonna do...

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.240
Not Steve A.G.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.240
We gotta bring Levy up

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.240
Levy's sitting down there on the floor

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.240
Steve Levy

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.240
You're gonna love it at Levy

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.240
More like a rivey

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.240
Man

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.240
Finally, more dudes on the stage

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.240
So here's the thing about that

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.240
That is just...

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.240
We're gonna have to just take...

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.240
Yeah, we're gonna have to just take that bullet

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.240
And I'm not gonna be one of these guys that says

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.240
Hey, you got a hundred million dollar movie

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.240
Take it easy, equality achieved

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.240
However, I will say

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.240
That because

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.240
We wanna be able to have consistency

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.240
We...

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.240
It's like...

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.240
For the D&D it is gonna be...

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.240
I had a wife

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.240
And I lost her

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.240
Because of the D&D

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.240
Yeah

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.240
Like

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.240
We'll continue to...

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.240
And plus, I looked into it

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.240
It turns out girls are actually bad at D&D

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.240
Oh no

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.240
I just...

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.240
I looked it up, I saw it online

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.240
You got to send your angry letters

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.240
To the show

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.240
The show

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.240
We're not gonna like circulate

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.240
Through special guests

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.240
We're brought to you by Gold Bond Powder

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.240
We're not gonna circulate through special guests

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.240
Which means that if we're starting

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.240
With a sausage party

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.240
It's gonna be a consistent sausage party

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.240
Every time we play D&D

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.240
The show is largely sausage party

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.240
But can women not join the game

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.240
If they've already played it?

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.240
Do the cast stay together from birth?

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.240
I...

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.240
I...

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.240
No

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.240
We're gonna...

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.240
Broke Dan Harmon

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.240
The game that we're gonna play

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.240
Welcome back, Jeff

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.240
Our D&D campaign started to fall apart

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.240
Because it started to become...

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.240
Yeah, we would have Curtis Armstrong

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.240
Two out of ten times

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.240
Camel, it was all...

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.240
Camel, Camel

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.240
So we have to force ourselves

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.240
To have like a rib cage

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.240
Where we're like...

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.240
There's people who are more likely to be here

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.240
Every single episode

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.240
And if one of them's gone

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.240
We'll make a judgment call on whether

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.240
They vanish

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.240
For that episode or go into another room

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.240
Or Spencer plays them, but largely

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.240
Or if we just take that episode off

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.240
But so that there can be consistency

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.240
Of character, and that's the other reason

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.240
We're moving it up earlier in the show

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.240
So that we'll be a little...

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.240
A little hair more towards sober

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.240
And that's one of the things

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.240
It's like...

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.240
What was the question?

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.240
The question was

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.240
How do you integrate

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.240
A woman

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.240
No, no, no, that's not the question

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.240
That's not the question

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.240
Starting with the same players

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.240
Because the answer is

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.240
You start bringing strangers up on stage every week

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.240
And that's what I'm trying to explain

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.240
Is that we have to take a hit on gender equality

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.240
And all that stuff in the interest

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.240
Of a solid D&D campaign

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.240
Because we don't...

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.240
That's what they said about baseball

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:20.240
Hahaha

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.240
And now we have our own postage stamps

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.240
Hahaha

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.240
It looks like we made it

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.240
You guys got a hundred million dollar movie

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.240
What is that?

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.240
What are you talking about? It's Wonder Woman

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.240
It's like a record breaking thing

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.240
Is a hundred million dollars good?

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.240
Yeah

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.240
Yes

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.240
Yeah, that's good for a movie

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.240
To make it its first weekend

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.240
What's your fucking character's name?

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.240
That was the question

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.240
I'm not telling you yet

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.240
No, that's my character's name

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.240
You're a human cleric, you said?

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.240
You're a human cleric

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.240
And you guys are in service

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.240
Of the Church of the Silver Flame

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.240
Yeah

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.240
What's your character's name?

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.240
I had the Fire Liker

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.240
Do you know your character's name?

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.240
I haven't really thought about it

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.240
Well, this is the time

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.240
I announced I was going to come back

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.240
And we were going to play D&D

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.240
You guys don't even have names for your characters

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.240
We've been hurt by you before

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.240
You announced

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.240
We were going to play D&D

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.240
You left us

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.240
This show doesn't pay

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.240
We were leaving the meltdown

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.240
We had to just find the castle

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.240
You changed the box at the comic book store

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.240
We couldn't even find it

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.240
I missed you guys

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.240
I got excited about our new campaign

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.240
I picked my spells

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.240
I picked your spells

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.240
No, it's not true

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.240
We consulted about that

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.240
Is there a middle gear

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.240
between

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.240
passionate

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.240
zealously

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.240
I'm so dedicated to us

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.240
doing this particular thing right now

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.240
And you totally fucking leaving the show

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.240
Like just you coming back

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.240
and just being like, oh, I'm back

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.240
It's good to be back

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.240
It's okay, Dan Forgotty was a human cleric

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.240
Dan is right, Jeff

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.240
Fuck you, Brandon

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.240
You're like Ulysses

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.240
He comes back

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.240
He's like, who's trying to fuck my wife?

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.240
And then he kills everybody

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.240
You know, one of those guys

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.240
I was like, I was told you were dead

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.240
I came to propose to your wife

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.240
I didn't touch her

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.240
I was just participating in an arrow shooting contest

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.240
Now I'm dead

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.240
I've been away, maybe I'm overcompensating

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.240
by my absence and I felt remiss

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.240
and so I thought

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.240
a little bit about what spells I have

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.240
They're mostly fire because I'm Chad the Fire Liker

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.240
Alright, I'm a gnome druid, by the way

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.240
Why do I always play small characters?

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.240
Is that because I'm tall?

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.240
I can't remember in this instance

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.240
Oh, because you liked the drawing I did

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.240
Oh, that's right

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.240
Was the idea of this segment

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.240
that you just want us to tell

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.240
you stuff about our characters?

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.240
Well, I mean, I really thought it would be

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.240
quick to come up with the names

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.240
and we'd move on

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.240
You're a cleric

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.240
So what kind of stuff are you into?

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.240
Like, what's your alignment?

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.240
Or even just what's your name?

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.240
No need to complicate it

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.240
I think your name should be Chad also

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.240
I was just going to say

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.240
Chad the Fire Hater

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.240
Chadrick, my name is Chadrick

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.240
That's not a good idea

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.240
And then Steve will be the Fire Lover

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.240
Yeah, I mean, Carlos

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.240
Carlos

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.240
Carlos

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.240
I like it

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.240
Carlos

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.240
Johnson

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.240
Carlos Johnson

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.240
What a funny name, Johnson

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.240
Yeah, where'd you get that?

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.240
Carlos Johnson the Unimaginative

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.240
Perfect

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.240
So you're like a healer, magic user kind of guy?

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.240
I'm a cleric

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.240
Yeah

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.240
So what's your relationship to the...

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.240
Well, what's Steve?

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.240
I've been thinking about it while on stage

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.240
and I was in Dan's office

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.240
for a phone call the other day

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.240
And on his window

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.240
board

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.240
You know what I'm talking about?

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:48.240
I might

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.240
They're the words Diarrhea Junior

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.240
And

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.240
I was really

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.240
Gets my curiosity

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.240
And

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.240
I think that should be my name

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.240
Maybe DJ for short

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.240
Oh, that's great

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.240
DJ, that's great

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.240
Okay, that's good

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.240
This role-playing game is playing itself

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.240
Yeah, so now we got to come up

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.240
with your characters, high concepts

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.240
and your great weaknesses

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.240
So, I mean, concepts

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.240
are already kind of come up

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.240
You're a pyromaniac gnome

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.240
Usually come up with your concept

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.240
because yours is generic

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.240
And Steve, you're kind of like a

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.240
person who can give people Diarrhea

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.240
Is that his special power?

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240
Oh, I mean, I think his power is he has it

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.240
He has to stay out of pools for 14 days

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.240
14 days

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.240
He has to drink a lot

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.240
DJ the no pool swimmer

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.240
His weaknesses, he has to

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.240
drink a lot of Pedialyte all the time

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.240
Well, he can't resist it

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.240
And your flaws, if you came up

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.240
with a concept, come up with a flaw

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.240
So the concept is that

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.240
does that translate into game terms

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.240
No, it's just like

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.240
I mean, if you're pitching Jeff Winger

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.240
you're all like, you know, out of work

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.240
Well, I don't know, you know, but like that

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.240
But for your character

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.240
You didn't have anything in mind for that one

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.240
No, because I don't know, I only know what Jeff's going to be

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:22.240
And Steve said he was kind of basing

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.240
his off link from Zelda, so that's kind

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.240
of his concept, but you don't really have one

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.240
Well, I think I'd like to be

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.240
an overzealous

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.240
I mean, that's judging the character

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.240
but he's

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.240
a zealous like

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.240
He's a zealot

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.240
I think you'd call him

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.240
Like one of those Westboro Baptists

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.240
Yeah, like somebody that

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.240
but not somebody that's

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.240
like a cult leader in the making

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.240
like somebody that has

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.240
that's so zealous

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.240
that it's really more about their ego

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.240
like a genuine zealot who actually has

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.240
a fucking

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.240
problem, like they found

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.240
meaning in this religion

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.240
and if it weren't for this religion

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.240
they'd be so fucked up, it's unspeakable

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.240
so they're hooked on it

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.240
and can't like

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.240
so maybe this person is like

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.240
You're like Christopher Eccleston

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:22.240
in The Leftovers

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.240
I haven't seen it, but

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.240
I would say

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.240
I would assume maybe like my character has

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.240
a problem, like they're a sociopath

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:32.240
You know, like Richard Spencer

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.240
Did you ever see that? Yeah

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.240
shitty people with Spencer in their name

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.240
it sucks

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.240
Did you ever see that

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.240
1992 YouTube video, it's 28 minutes long

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.240
called Child of Rage

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.240
it's this little girl, she keeps going

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.240
and there's an off-screen therapist that keeps going

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.240
like, what would you like to do to your little brother

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.240
pick him with pans

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.240
like she's like, because she was adopted

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.240
and she was found like in a crib

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.240
in her own piss and stuff and she like

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.240
so she didn't know love and didn't

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.240
doesn't know how to process it

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.240
like there's something wrong with this guy

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.240
that then he found

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.240
like his religion

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.240
right, he's not

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.240
and it really has like given him meaning

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.240
and direction, but he doesn't

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.240
it hasn't helped him grow to the extent that

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.240
if he were to ever say he needs

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.240
this religion to really keep him together

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.240
right, I like that

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.240
so much

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.240
religious

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.240
fanatic, it's like when you meet somebody

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.240
that you're like, oh man, you're super

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.240
super dedicated to being a nerd

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.240
because if you weren't a nerd

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.240
someone would actually give you Iron Man Armor

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.240
the first thing you do is step on innocent people's heads

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.240
because you're so angry

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.240
but not like, I don't think this guy has rage issues

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.240
as much as I think he actually

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:46.240
doesn't know right from wrong

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.240
and so he's relieved to feel that

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.240
yeah

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.240
I like it, so

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.240
alright, come up with, Steve do you have anything yet

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:56.240
come up with weaknesses if you haven't yet

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.240
think about that, Steve do you have anything

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.240
for concept weakness

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.240
what's Diarrhea Jr's race and class again

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.240
he's an elf or half elf

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.240
he's a elf fighter

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.240
I think that my guys

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.240
my guys weakness would be susceptibility

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.240
to like kind of charm

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.240
like kind of things because if he's like

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.240
he doesn't have like a follower

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.240
well yeah he doesn't

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.240
if you can break through his force

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.240
field of

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.240
of

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.240
social programming that he

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.240
anybody that had

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.240
that was in the business

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.240
of making people think things

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.240
or illusion magic or stuff like that

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.240
that he'd be a little more susceptible

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.240
maybe he'd have a penalty against that because he's like

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.240
kind of

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.240
is that a good weakness

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.240
it's okay

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.240
maybe he's a guy who

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.240
hopes his weaknesses are up to stuff

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.240
he's really insecure about it

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.240
then you have extreme nut allergies

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.240
can you

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.240
can you help me

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.240
I'm not jazzed about that

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.240
it's hard to say because the only thing is

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.240
I think this is kind of what I told Jeff a little bit

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.240
it would be better if they weren't part of your character

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.240
concept so it's like

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.240
that's kind of a natural consequence of your

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.240
concept so this would be a more lateral

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.240
weakness

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.240
he also

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.240
he never turns right

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.240
oh okay

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.240
polio

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.240
sure

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.240
polio

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.240
do you get wheeled around

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.240
polio

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.240
my dad survived

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.240
the polio epidemic in the 50s

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.240
so he has like a withered leg

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.240
my dad

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.240
so I grew up with a very masculine dad who

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.240
walked with a masculine limp

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.240
but when he wears shorts he says like this little

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.240
toothpick leg

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.240
this is real life

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.240
I'm Carlos the unimaginative

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.240
I

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.240
I write what I know

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.240
so I was

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.240
maybe I

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.240
I literally have a physical

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.240
limitation

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.240
like I had

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.240
I survived a disease

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.240
that left me permanently

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.240
capable

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.240
I

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.240
I

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.240
I

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.240
father's day is next weekend

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.240
the choices you're making right now will stick

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.240
with you for a long time

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.240
no I'm trying to yeah I mean go big

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.240
or go home right

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.240
I mean he's a cleric so I figured you know like he's

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.240
yeah like I don't know is that

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.240
is that I can keep

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.240
that's fine but I mean I will say that

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.240
we do live in a world I mean we don't

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.240
but you will know where magic

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.240
can heal death

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.240
even so like a leg

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.240
boy howdy can that be healed

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.240
well what

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.240
well what about like you know like

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.240
a

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.240
that doesn't mean he can't be you know

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.240
Dr. Strange the guy that's like he he's playing

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.240
basketball and it's like oh actually

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.240
I'm supposed to be totally fucking

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.240
immobile but I went to

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.240
like what if what if he

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.240
what if he did he is healed with magic

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:10.240
but he has like there's magic keeping

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.240
him kind of go without it

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.240
oh so he's like we're in a magic

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:16.240
brace yeah okay

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.240
or I like that a lot or he has to constantly

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.240
drink some kind of potion or something that he's

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.240
basically addicted to all right yeah

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.240
yeah well that'll slot into

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:26.240
great okay laugh for me and he's

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.240
it

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.240
Steve you have anything

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:32.240
no Steve A. J.

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.240
man

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.240
I'm still thinking about homeless men

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.240
frankly

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.240
all right no I'm not leaving

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.240
though oh sorry

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.240
uh

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.240
can you help me out what it would what's

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.240
a normal kind of weakness

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.240
well what's your character concept

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.240
uh

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.240
the mute swordsman from far away

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.240
that's your character

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.240
concept okay not completely

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.240
mute but you don't talk much

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.240
hmm look if you're open to pitches

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.240
I think you know you're nervous right now

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.240
because the reason you're nervous and lethargic

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.240
is because you don't want to fuck this up

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:10.240
the reason you don't want to fuck it up is because

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.240
you want to be really good when we play D&D

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.240
in the podcast I do want to be good

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.240
you're gonna be you're you should

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.240
you should really like

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.240
I think you should be

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.240
you should be yourself

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:24.240
I think you should be like like really enthusiastic

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.240
all right

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.240
that's his weakness

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.240
that's a terrible weakness like

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.240
what is this what is your character

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.240
what is your path elf

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.240
just elf but yeah I'm an elf

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.240
swordsman right yep fighter

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.240
so is it so is it fire sword

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:42.240
and we're writing his history we don't know his history

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.240
fire like uh huh

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.240
are we writing his history like a little

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.240
bit I mean we're about to now

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.240
once we get his weakness but we can move on

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.240
could he be kind of a kind of big can the

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.240
cold be weak my weakness

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.240
it colds everyone's weakness in a way that cold

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.240
this is like one week then we're gonna be playing

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.240
and you're gonna we're gonna want your leaving is happening

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.240
I think he should be can't your problems

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:04.240
just be there you're like leaving

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.240
that he's like

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.240
that he's like erstwhile he's like a squire

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.240
you know he was like assigned to

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.240
this church because it's like

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.240
you're like you're this guy like

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.240
they're always telling me that you love me

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.240
and stuff and they should eat better and I'm like

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.240
yeah go fuck yourself yeah

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.240
it's a huge weakness

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.240
his weakness he's like

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.240
like he's a caretaker to the

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.240
point of extremism like he worries

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.240
more about other people than he should probably care more

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.240
about himself he's crippled by his naivete

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.240
he's an anxious warrior that might be true

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.240
you have an ideology that you actually

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.240
think that that a happy ending is possible

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.240
for this species and it's sad

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.240
sometimes okay

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.240
that's true

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.240
and Jeff you're afraid of the dark

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.240
right

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.240
why couldn't you go first

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.240
what are you doing

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.240
terrifying the dark

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.240
because my character

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.240
it's not unrelated maybe it's partially related

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.240
because I was raised

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.240
I got captured when I was like a little

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.240
druid gnome

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.240
and held by demons

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.240
like underground and I

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.240
prayed to like the silver flame gods

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.240
and like actually

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.240
conjured fire and so like I use

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.240
like fire is kind of a crutch because I'm afraid

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.240
I'm terrified of the dark

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.240
does that okay so I'm

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.240
like also kind of a germaphobe

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.240
did you

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.240
because I want to make sure my character balances

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.240
with yours but I'm thinking more about my

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.240
like like like could I be like this

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.240
like whatever my thing is that

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.240
has me like I'm I'm sort of a

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.240
self-flagellating kind of character

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.240
figuratively or literally where I'm like oh

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.240
pain is important

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.240
and and you have to

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.240
you know it's like like I'm actually

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.240
suspicious you know like like

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.240
like like like

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.240
like 20%

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.240
dinklage in game of thrones

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.240
10% rocket raccoon

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.240
and then like 40%

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.240
I

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.240
guess me but then like

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.240
I can't remember the percentages

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:10.240
and how they added up I think you're at 70

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.240
okay but

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.240
but like somebody that's like kind of like like

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:16.240
like oh they figure like

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.240
you're supposed to like

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.240
they can't they can't accept a good fortune

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.240
they can't they can't accept

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.240
joy like me they want

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.240
to they want it's

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.240
those people that like whip themselves literally

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.240
yeah you you you flash

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.240

you you you you like

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:38.240
earthly pleasures and things like that yeah

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.240
cool

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.240
all right I'm afraid of the dark

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:44.240
all right

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.240
so let's let's let's come up with your

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.240
with your with your character stories so

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.240
everyone gets to come up with their own

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.240
character background like where they started

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.240
their adventures like where would you guys

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.240
get you do you know where you get your start

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.240
you might not know

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.240
wait me all of you

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.240
these are you know we're thinking about these in waves

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.240
you mean backstory or where we're back

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.240
story so where'd you get your start like

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:08.240
so for you your religious guy so it might be

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:10.240
where you found religion and like joined the church

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.240
or something yeah I'm I'm just riffing

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.240
here but I right yeah we're all just yeah

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.240
right we're making it up I'm just gonna go from

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:18.240
birth forward I

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.240
I think I was

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.240
like one of those kids whose parents like

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.240
like prostituted them you know like

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.240
like had them like

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:28.240
like

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.240
toddlers and tiara's kind of thing or

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.240
but

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.240
less first world more

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.240
low hand brass tacks kind of

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.240
prostitution like like like genuine genuine

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.240
genuine horrible abuse at the hands of

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:42.240
like I just to just left to

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.240
drift in a horrible society

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.240
like like born in filth

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.240
and and then subject

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.240
to the horrible inhumanities

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.240
and then developed a horrible

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.240
like I like this pain yeah

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.240
and then and then because of

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.240
that maybe in my adolescent years will put a pin

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.240
in it but what whatever that

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.240
was it led to

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.240
injury or disease

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.240
so severe that I was finally

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.240
broken down and then found

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.240
this maybe somebody from this religion

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.240
like like converted me and

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.240
then I started to become a cleric

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.240
like nineteen or something and

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.240
then so so then and then but then within

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.240
this church of the silver flame

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.240
I I I'm like

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.240
a zealot that because

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.240
I'm not politically facile I'm always

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.240
you know I'm not a threat

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:30.240
to any of the higher ups

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.240
I'm like always good for being

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.240
sent on a mission but it's like my

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.240
only problem is that I'm kind of like

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.240
like I will like like

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:40.240
like I need I'm not gonna make a good

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.240
cardinal because I'll always

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.240
question hypocrisy of the church

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.240
itself so like I kind of been like

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.240
bounced around

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.240
and like they'll still make

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.240
me do weird shit if you can justify

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.240
it yeah so I

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.240
so I wound up at this place because

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.240
I maybe this is like

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.240
I kind of in the outskirts this place

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.240
this this church

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.240
yeah well I mean it's a big church

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.240
it's like it covers the whole country

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.240
but I mean are we geographically gonna start

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.240
a place that's like yeah outskirts

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:12.240
okay sorry so maybe I've been transferred

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:14.240
to that place recently

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.240
because of a

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:18.240
recent like dust up I had

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.240
with a superior where I called them

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.240
out on their religious hypocrisy

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.240
sent to the outskirts yeah great

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.240
that's how you got your start

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.240
either of you guys have anything Steve looks like

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.240
he's going for something I guess I'm

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.240
in

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.240
so

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.240
my

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.240
my village

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.240
when I was a kid was burned to the ground

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.240
I love it

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.240
and my parents

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.240
were murdered

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.240
but the church

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:50.240
took me in

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.240
but the thing that I don't know is that

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.240
it was the church that murdered my entire

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.240
village including my parents

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.240
okay I don't think

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.240
the crowd likes that you should change your story

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:02.240
no that's great

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.240
alright

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.240
great Jeff

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:08.240
yeah I think that

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:10.240
like I said I feel like

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.240
I was kind of born in captivity

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:14.240
right and you're in darkness by demons

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:16.240
in darkness surrounded by demons and all there

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.240
was was like the only light was like flaming

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:20.240
torches and the rest of my family

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.240
were just these like super religious

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.240
very docile

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.240
Druids who didn't believe in violence

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.240
they were so pure

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.240
and I didn't want to

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.240
just die in there like I watched all my family

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.240
die inside this like these wooden cages

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.240
inside this like darkness

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.240
and I thought the only way to get out

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.240
is I like I heard your family

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.240
dying yeah I heard them die right

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:44.240
well you can there's a little flickering

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.240
of flame you can kind of you see them fall over

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.240
shadows there could be a twist to season

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.240
three where we reveal in flashback oh no

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:52.240
it was yeah that was a sock

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.240
but

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.240
but then like I like

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.240
because they were so docile they didn't

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.240
like ever used like their

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.240
druidic powers like

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.240
there was no nature in there to really

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.240
summon because we're just like we're so

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.240
underground and hidden that

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.240
I like I think I like communed

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.240
with like the silver flame

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.240
you know who's the spirit that

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.240
you call to the spirit of the silver flame

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.240
right I called to that

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.240
and I was given this kind of

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.240
extra violent power of fire

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.240
and I ended up just burning my way out

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.240
and kind of like so I'm like I like I'm

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.240
using like it seems like an anti-nature

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.240
thing to like to want to set things on fire

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.240
but that was how I got out

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.240
and so I'm just kind of

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.240
I think I'm a little guilt-ridden about the fact that I have

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.240
more of a violent tendency than I wish I did

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.240
so I try to use it like my flames

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.240
to purify things and purify myself

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.240
I like it

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:46.240
I almost started crying

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.240
I like that there's a theme of darkness

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.240
like we don't just have like

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.240
a

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.240
person that

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.240
eats marshmallows for breakfast and doesn't

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:58.240
know pain because they whatever

01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:00.240
they like we're all

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.240
a little damaged there's a very cultish

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.240
dark like we fit into

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.240
a theme that's good I like that

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.240
yeah I think it's very genre

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.240
yeah so

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.240
now we're gonna come up with how you guys

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.240
met so Jeff is gonna

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.240
come up with how he met Steve Steve's gonna come

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.240
up with how I met Dan and Dan's gonna come up

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.240
with how I met Jeff and then we'll do a second

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.240
round of that so

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.240
it's and if you forget it's

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.240
the person to the right and then Dan you wrap around

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.240
Jeff and Steve briefly you're an elf

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.240
fighter and what briefly was your family

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:32.240
died family died it was the church

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:34.240
but he doesn't know okay um

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:36.240
wait can I just

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.240
so

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.240
the

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.240
the first adventure isn't gonna be like how we

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:44.240
met no well I mean this could be

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:46.240
well

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.240
what's the first adventure in the future I just mean no

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.240
no when we're about to play when we play it yeah

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.240
no you'll have met each other at the very

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:54.240
least like you'll you'll you know if we're doing

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.240
like modern TV we're not writing an origin

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.240
pilot we're starting an episode seven

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:00.240
yeah well this would be the origin pilot

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:02.240
that we're currently writing right now right

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:04.240
right and so we're not gonna start like hey

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.240
how are you my name is

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:08.240
Donald exactly it might be like oh we're

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.240
back in the same wagon

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.240
but it's not like right who are you fucks

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.240
yeah I like that that's that's smart from a

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.240
from a from a from a peak TV

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.240
Steve how old are you when you're

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.240
when your family got killed probably

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.240
probably

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.240
elves are old too

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.240
so whatever

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.240
106

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.240
five or five

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.240
five

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.240
all right so my well I met Steve

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.240
when I when I when I burst out of

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.240
this cave do you think elves live so

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.240
long that when they're 70 they're like

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.240
sucking on a pacifier

01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.240
what's the point of living long

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.240
of it

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.240
when I came

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:50.240
out of the darkness I was also like five

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:52.240
and I stumbled

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.240
into him and he because

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.240
he's an elf a little more worldly and a little more

01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.240
like you're a fighter right

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.240
yeah I feel like he took pity on me and kind

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.240
of took me under his wing because I was this little

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.240
blinded mole person I've been living in darkness

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:06.240
and I'm terrified of the dark you guys

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.240
and he kind of took me under

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.240
his wing and kind of looked after me and

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.240
kind of got me on my feet

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.240
he was like my kid brother yeah

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.240
you guys were temporary brothers

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.240
yeah is that good enough

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.240
sure

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.240
I guess well I mean yeah

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.240
whoever has an idea

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.240
so after my village

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.240
was burned down

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:30.240
I don't remember any of it but that's

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:32.240
you know the church

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.240
adopted me and they raised me

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.240
and that was my family they're the best

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.240
and

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:40.240
Dan's character

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.240
was my mentor and he took me under his wing

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.240
and he was like look see a lot of

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.240
myself in you and

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.240
I'm gonna make sure that you

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.240
you know can run this

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:52.240
church

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.240
later on

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.240
right so I killed

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.240
his parents no I'm kidding

01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.240
oh yeah

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:02.240
are you suggesting you guys are the same age

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.240
well no

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:06.240
when we met

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.240
well I think no we're both five

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.240
well let's see like no I thought that was when we met

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:12.240
yeah but let's say like we've known

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:14.240
each other for let's say 20 years

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.240
who me and you know me and Steve

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:18.240
like we were children when we met

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.240
but we kind of grew up together

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:22.240
so like I could we just make it simple

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.240
and I'm kind of like a whip like I've

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.240
fucked up like Dumbledore is that like

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.240
like I'm the

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.240
collecting we met at the tavern and

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.240
you're the priest from the keepers

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.240
you did unspeakable

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.240
things to these kids

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:40.240
I'm a teacher I'm a professor

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.240
what about I mean not to be hacky like X many

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.240
about it or you know like

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:46.240
like you recognize kind of nascent

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:48.240
greatness in our in our spirituality

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:50.240
and you kind of mentor doesn't

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:52.240
kind of raises and like focus our powers

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.240
well I think it's like almost like now and this is

01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:56.240
where we get into like don't you know whatever

01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.240
you whatever you have in store for us is fine

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.240
but like the thing that would be interesting was that

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.240
it's like it's kind of a suicide mission

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.240
but I'm taking my favorite students with

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.240
me and I don't mean like I'm superior to you guys

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.240
but I'm older than you

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:10.240
were like like I'm a cleric

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.240
at the church of the silver flame

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.240
the path

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:16.240
that brought you guys together then joined

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.240
and led you to where I have been

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.240
for a while yeah and I was

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.240
like trying to teach you guys to like

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.240
meditate or whatever but then

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:26.240
like I got I got like a mission

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.240
or something right in the timeline

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.240
did you get sent to the outskirts before

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:32.240
you met let you get like you know

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.240
edged out by the the church before

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.240
you met them or after before

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.240
well I well I'll go

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.240
either but you want me to pick no yeah

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:42.240
yeah before

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.240
because because because I've been

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.240
I've been actually in the outskirts

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:48.240
for a while because it's like the pachinko

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.240
machine of society like brought me to

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.240
like where I am where I'm like

01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.240
I just hang out I make a paycheck I teach

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.240
people to pray and like that pain

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:58.240
is important so that sounds like

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.240
you connected and then you got sent away

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:02.240
and kind of you're not in contact

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.240
with them to I got like like I like

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.240
these guys like they I got a telegram

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:08.240
that said you need to go get the orb of

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:10.240
the thing not to tell you your job but

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:12.240
should probably be an orb

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.240
and I'm not saying this is our first

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.240
adventure because like I said we're starting

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.240
episode 7 but maybe the origin was that

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.240
this is what yeah they said hey

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.240
shithead like I'm in the outskirts

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.240
because I was already a piece

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:26.240
of shit and then they like

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:28.240
just wanted to kill me

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:30.240
and then I was allowed to take

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:32.240
like like people and they came with

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:34.240
me and we

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.240
maybe had success and so

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.240
now we're kind of like out there and we get like

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.240
communicates and they go okay now go do this

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.240
yeah I got because now we've become like

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.240
black water for this church we're kind of working

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.240
together to kind of regain favor maybe back

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.240
you'll be together at the beginning

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:50.240
like you'll be on a mission

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.240
like together I'll come up with it so

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.240
we're kind of like like a little band of

01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:56.240
misfits that kind of not is in good

01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.240
graces with the church maybe because we're not

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.240
pure enough and we're trying to like we're trying

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:02.240
to like prove ourselves yeah it probably

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.240
helped to have a goal like how do we see

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:06.240
the future like I kind of like

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:08.240
like like what do we think what do we hope

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.240
the outcome of the church of the silver flame

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.240
exists to exercise and purify

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.240
the world of evil so I don't know that

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:16.240
doesn't necessarily have to be your goal but

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:18.240
that's kind of what the church exists for like

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:20.240
you know Christianity is like save all

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.240
sinners like this is just kill all

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.240
evil yeah I think like it would be cool

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:26.240
like if we're all kind of zealots in our own

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.240
way but we're not very orthodox about

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.240
like we're like we're regulars we're

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:32.240
rough around the edges but we're trying to

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:34.240
my religion my part of the silver flame

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:36.240
I'm attracted to the idea of like people

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.240
keep saying oh our job is to purify

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.240
by burning and like

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.240
they don't focus on the filth that is

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.240
the wood you have to fucking be

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.240
you have to have the pain and

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.240
and like and you are setting

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:50.240
it on fire like I like these guys because

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.240
they're nuts and bolts people that get results

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:54.240
done and I don't I think that

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.240
I've been fired let's say

01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:58.240
from three

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.240
shows I created I mean campaigns

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.240
and like I'm

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.240
out there and I'm going like like my

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.240
overall goal is I don't

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:08.240
care if I die

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.240
trying I mean I don't want to die

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:12.240
but I want to actually prove

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.240
that politics

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.240
and kissing

01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:18.240
ass and stuff is like

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:20.240
that this this church the religion

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:22.240
is right right the

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:24.240
the church is wrong

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:26.240
I know

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:28.240
that they they've got us out here

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:30.240
wandering doing missions because they can't

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:32.240
wait for us to die I love it that we

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:34.240
keep not dying

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.240
so I'm a little I'm like the dark version

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.240
of Tom Hanks and saving Private Ryan where I'm

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.240
like like just fucking

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:42.240
don't let the German go but

01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.240
but the

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:46.240
where I'm like that like like we're out

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:48.240
there it's like I I do believe

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:50.240
in my zealous heart that one day

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:52.240
we're gonna we're gonna

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:54.240
make headlines like like or we're gonna

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.240
do their job for them yeah

01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.240
we're a little renegade we're going a look like

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:00.240
we're we're we don't go

01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:02.240
through normal channels maybe but we all are

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:04.240
zealots in our own way but we do really believe

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.240
like in some sort of

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.240
like that we can rid the world

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:10.240
of evil awesome last

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:12.240
last part okay so now

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.240
you'd come over color

01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:16.240
yeah

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:18.240
no you come up with that one

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.240
special thing about your character so

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:22.240
I mean

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:24.240
you're already someone who's like

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.240
magically healthy

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:28.240
that might be your thing but you could have a different thing

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.240
but this is like this is like a special

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.240
special thing like

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:34.240
a unique Mary Sue trait

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:36.240
Mary Sue

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:38.240
let's move past it

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.240
what

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:42.240
did you say wisdom basket or let's get past it

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:44.240
let's move past it okay

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:46.240
yeah yeah that's a good idea

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.240
what if you had a wisdom basket

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:50.240
that

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:52.240
that should be the secret

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.240
I thought he said Elizabeth the wisdom basket

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.240
I have a

01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:58.240
I have a wisdom basket

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.240
that if I ever

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:02.240
lose like because it's like

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:04.240
it's like a self

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.240
self torturing thing where every all the pain

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.240
I feel I collect it

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.240
that's I don't want to I don't want to connect

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.240
all these dots so this needs to be like

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:14.240
lateral like like like this

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.240
is like a just a thing like a glass

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:18.240
yeah like I said it is pretty

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:20.240
reasonably unique that like you

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:22.240
have some sort of ailment that you're

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:24.240
constantly fighting against that again

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.240
doesn't have to be give me

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.240
for instance about how specific you want this to be

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.240
you're secretly a fairy

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.240
you

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.240
you

01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:36.240
Spencer could we get back to the game

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:38.240
please and stop

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.240
attacking each other

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.240
he's just

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:44.240
he just asked a question

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:46.240
you don't have to get angry at everyone

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:48.240
you're

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.240
the fastest gun slinger

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.240
in the west or something you know

01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:54.240
special thing

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:56.240
photographic memory

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:58.240
premature ejaculator

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:00.240
yeah there you go

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:02.240
just an example

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:04.240
that's

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.240
a good one

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.240
you guys go first let me think

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:10.240
yeah I should

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.240
say what

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.240
say what

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.240
burns cover

01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.240
my body

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:20.240
oh yeah so I'm just totally burned

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.240
I don't think that's unique enough

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:24.240
huh that's not unique enough yeah

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.240
I think a lot of people are burned

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.240
you're asshole

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:30.240
I'm so glad you heard it

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.240
my asshole is one giant third degree

01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:34.240
burn oh no

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:36.240
that's horrifying

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:38.240
it's like that piece of like that part of the pizza

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:40.240
that you try to eat around because it's burnt

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:42.240
what's happening

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.240
are you imagining it

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.240
what's that pain

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.240
yeah I'm thinking

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:50.240
I think you're imagining it

01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:52.240
I had night terrors

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:54.240
that's a good one

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.240
this isn't a weakness

01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:58.240
I can't sleep around other people

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:00.240
I might stab them

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:02.240
that's not unique

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:04.240
this is helpful

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.240
the most so unique

01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:08.240
this is the one guy in all of midi

01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:10.240
and it might not be a talent

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:12.240
but it's definitely something unique

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:14.240
okay

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:16.240
what'd you say

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.240
you got three balls is that what you said

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.240
you once stole the robe off the king's back

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.240
and he thanked you for it

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:24.240
like that's unique

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.240
we refuse this to employ any women

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.240
that's all

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.240
not unique

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:36.240
and he's just here to fucking hate on you the entire time

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:40.240
it's fine I accept it

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:42.240
what if my dick was fireproof

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.240
since the gentleman in the front row

01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:46.240
alright

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.240
I thought this was supposed to be imaginary

01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:56.240
unique

01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:00.240
can you produce ice cream at will from your hands

01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:02.240
the question was

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:04.240
what if you could produce ice cream at will

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:06.240
from your hands

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:08.240
the answer is not unique enough

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:10.240
that would be badass

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:12.240
you'd have diabetes

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:14.240
you have a you have a

01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:16.240
I have a pair of 3D glasses

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.240
it's unique

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.240
because 3D has not been invented yet

01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:22.240
right

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.240
they're just useless

01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:26.240
a glass eye

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.240
is more unique than your body being covered with burns

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:30.240
you're the only person with a glass eye

01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.240
up to the uniquity of this world

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.240
what'd you say sir

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:38.240
zeppelins

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.240
I again only heard the word zeppelins

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:42.240
because I talked over the repeat of your question

01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:44.240
well now you're

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:46.240
he needs to repeat a zeppelins question

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:48.240
and I'll get to you in a second

01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.240
the zeppelins guy on the count of three

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:52.240
asked your question so that I'm not talking over the beginning of your zeppelins question

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:54.240
I know it ends with the word zeppelins

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.240
one two three

01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:58.240
and the thing is remember to

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.240
PENOPOLY

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.240
PENOPOLY of zeppelins

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.240
oh monopoly

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.240
I have a monopoly over zeppelins

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.240
okay

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:10.240
young lady what did you

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.240
no wrong answers

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:14.240
no wrong answers

01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:16.240
she said a glass eye that sees

01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.240
five minutes into the future

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:20.240
sorry I wasn't trying to

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:22.240
see his five minutes future

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:24.240
I think that's too powerful

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:26.240
I think we're looking for

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.240
what if like I

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:30.240
someone just said

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:32.240
all your fingers are thumbs

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:38.240
but your thumb is five fingers

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:40.240
oh man that's gross

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.240
maybe on one hand

01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:44.240
like all the fingers are thumbs

01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:46.240
would that make you more agile

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.240
yeah probably a bit

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:50.240
and if so why doesn't

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:52.240
some species have

01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:54.240
I can what

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:56.240
I can understand

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:58.240
cats

01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:00.240
oh cats

01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:02.240
I was like I'm with you lady

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:04.240
I don't get it

01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:06.240
I cannot understand that

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:08.240
you can understand

01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:10.240
cats but only the musical

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:12.240
like you

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:14.240
you understand what that midnight song is about

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:16.240
but you're saying like it shouldn't translate into like

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:18.240
playable kind of

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:20.240
it shouldn't be like I'm the most rich person in the world

01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:22.240
or I have superman powers

01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:24.240
if anytime there's a cat in the game

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.240
I can talk to it I mean that is not

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.240
unique enough I would say you're blind

01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:30.240
and deaf every full moon

01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:32.240
if nothing else

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:36.240
this is a good exercise

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.240
are you raising your hand over here

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.240
your magic leg brace is a weapon

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.240
my magic leg brace is a weapon

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.240
that is unique

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:48.240
how unique is that possible

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.240
no one has ever used their leg brace as a weapon

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.240
it blows

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:58.240
that's the other thing that blows people's minds

01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.240
holy shit a leg brace being used as a weapon

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.240
that's never been done before

01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:06.240
well yeah I think he's feeling

01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.240
I think he loves it

01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:10.240
I think we got our

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:12.240
I would have loved it before I was told that all this other stuff wasn't unique enough

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:14.240
your leg brace can be used as a weapon

01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:16.240
no no it's fine

01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:18.240
that's like a summer movie from the 90s

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.240
how about this

01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:22.240
this might be a shitty pitch

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.240
I have a tattoo of an eyeball on my forehead

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:26.240
and occasionally if I really focus

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.240
I can see

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:30.240
45 seconds into the future

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:32.240
that's still too powerful

01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.240
that's too powerful? yeah man

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.240
you're making a big playable thing

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:38.240
I just have a tattoo of an eyeball on my forehead

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.240
but this is a really interesting thing

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:42.240
like if people ask you something

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.240
is there something that makes you different

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.240
from everyone on the planet

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:48.240
shoot fire from it

01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:50.240
but okay

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.240
what

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:54.240
45 seconds into the future

01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:56.240
yes

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:58.240
how about this

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.240
I have a tattoo of an eyeball on my forehead

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:02.240
and I can see when my eyes are closed

01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:04.240
yeah yeah that's fine

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.240
there we go

01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:08.240
I can pretend like I'm sleeping

01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:10.240
but I'm watching every mother fucker

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.240
you can see when your eyes are closed

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:14.240
that's fair enough

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.240
that's not too super powerful

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:18.240
it's a bit of an advantage but I think it's cool enough

01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:20.240
like it's not overpowered

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.240
people are like hey you go to sleep

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:24.240
I am sleeping

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:26.240
but you answered the question

01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.240
brushing my teeth and fixing my hair

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:34.240
leavey you go

01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:36.240
also we can move off this if you don't think it's cool

01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:38.240
no are you fucking kidding me

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:40.240
this is the reason why we play

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:44.240
vodka

01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:46.240
oh but hang on

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:48.240
I can amend mine a little bit

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.240
to make it better

01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:52.240
the tattoo of the eyeball on my forehead

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.240
it's a closed eye

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.240
I don't know I think it's got to be an open eye

01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:58.240
it's got to be an open eye

01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:00.240
yeah it's got to be like a hint

01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:02.240
it's kind of poorly drawn

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:04.240
it doesn't even look like an eyeball really

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:06.240
it's poorly crafted

01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:08.240
it's like a shitty jail tattoo of an eyeball

01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:12.240
I got it done in the dark

01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:16.240
I'm trying to think of what's unique

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.240
about

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.240
any of us

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.240
which is interesting

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.240
I think we don't really want to have

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:26.240
just a thing that makes us totally different

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:28.240
as much as we want to be really really really good at one thing

01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:30.240
you know that's what we fantasize about

01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:32.240
none of us really actually wants

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:34.240
like a thing that makes us

01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:36.240
absolutely different from everyone else

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:38.240
as much as our stories pretend

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.240
you're really good at dividing up the tab

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:42.240
when multiple people are like paying for dinner

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:44.240
like you know exactly who

01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:46.240
and there's those things like I remember

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:48.240
I remember we had that

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:50.240
I was in Milwaukee and we talked

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:52.240
and like one of the four people

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:54.240
because someone asked at the table what do you think you're better at

01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.240
than anybody else

01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:58.240
and I had some pretentious answer

01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:00.240
about being able to write dialogue forever

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.240
but there was a guy

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:04.240
who said I can count the number of words

01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:06.240
in your sentence no matter how long it is

01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:08.240
it was

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:10.240
Joe

01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:12.240
I can't remember his name from Madison Comedy

01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:14.240
Sports Joe OCD

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:16.240
what? Joe CD

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:18.240
Joe CD

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.240
No

01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:24.240
Joe

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.240
Joe Thompson

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:28.240
Madison Comedy Sports Joe Thompson

01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:30.240
I don't know if I know Joe

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:32.240
he all of a sudden he just goes yeah I can do that

01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:34.240
and I was like fuck you you can't do that

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:36.240
tell me how many words in this sentence he's like 17

01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:38.240
and it was like fuck you

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:40.240
and then for the rest of the night and he was like

01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:42.240
you know like you could tell that

01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:44.240
he's been living with it his whole life

01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:46.240
right you could do that

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:48.240
but it's like

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.240
what if you have complete amnesia

01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:52.240
for five minutes every day

01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:54.240
but to the point where you don't even know

01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:56.240
what a human is

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:58.240
you don't know what your hand is

01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:00.240
the sun

01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:02.240
but for just five minutes every day

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:04.240
oh yeah every five minutes you go on a salvia trip

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:08.240
that's what happens man

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.240
you make a seven layer dip

01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:12.240
that's to die for

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:14.240
right

01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.240
it's almost magically delicious

01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:18.240
how good your seven layer dip is

01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:24.240
right that's a good one

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.240
haunted by the voices of the people

01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:28.240
I can hear them

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:30.240
I can hear the voices of the people I've killed

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.240
yeah you're haunted or maybe even

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:34.240
maybe even informed by them

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:36.240
but you've never killed anybody

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.240
you're gonna find this out later

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:44.240
what if I'm

01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:46.240
I like that a lot

01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:48.240
what if I'm haunted by the voices

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.240
of people I'm libel

01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:52.240
I'm destined to kill

01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.240
no that's stupid it's like a fucking

01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:56.240
dumb like what am I

01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:58.240
that would be a reveal I think

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.240
cause then I'm like oh I'm gonna make sure I don't kill that person

01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:02.240
okay well I mean

01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:04.240
what do you think we need to do now

01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:06.240
there's another cleric in your church

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:08.240
that makes eight layer dip

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:12.240
what that eight layer is

01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:14.240
I hear the voices

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.240
of every single person

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:18.240
that I've ever killed

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:20.240
great I love it

01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:22.240
does Steve have any

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.240
oh sorry you look like you're about to say something

01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:26.240
no it's just like therefore that's a reason

01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:28.240
why I'd rather not kill people

01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:30.240
and it keeps getting louder and louder

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.240
I like it

01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:34.240
what if

01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:36.240
also the longer you go

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:38.240
without killing

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.240
that you've gone their voices start to fade

01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:42.240
but as soon as you kill someone

01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:44.240
all those voices come back

01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:46.240
including the persons that you killed

01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:48.240
I like that too yeah that will fuse us

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:50.240
I like that because then I'm like

01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:52.240
then I have a very disingenuous

01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:54.240
reason to be the guy

01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:56.240
that just doesn't want to fight

01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.240
you know what

01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:00.240
number one

01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:02.240
okay one more is not gonna

01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:04.240
make a big difference I'll get back on my

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:06.240
diet tomorrow

01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:08.240
yeah yeah

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:10.240
I really like that

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:12.240
I'm eating souls or something

01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:14.240
but also every time you kill another person

01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.240
you lose one layer out of your dip

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:22.240
it's almost just sour cream at the end

01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:24.240
and then you die

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:26.240
alright I fucking nailed it

01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:28.240
you guys go

01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:32.240
so complicated and it was a woman

01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:34.240
that's the only idea from

01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:40.240
I don't know Spencer

01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:42.240
ask a woman

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:44.240
you have

01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:46.240
cry every time you masturbate

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:48.240
I think is what she said

01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:52.240
not unique at all

01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:58.240
in general or to me

01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.240
I stopped ordering lubricant

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:02.240
oh my tears gonna do it

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:12.240
I have incredible

01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:14.240
sniper like accuracy

01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:16.240
when throwing any object

01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:18.240
too powerful

01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:20.240
your gambit

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:22.240
bullseye

01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:24.240
really good at bar games

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:26.240
oh like cheese acid

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:28.240
also too powerful

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:30.240
Spanish Tourette

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:34.240
even you don't understand

01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:36.240
what you're saying

01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:38.240
that better be the episode title

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:44.240
I wish I couldn't see

01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:46.240
that through I wish I could

01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:50.240
yeah fendom

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.240
fendom

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:54.240
that's actually really

01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:56.240
you

01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:58.240
you get

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.240
turned on by

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:02.240
being financially exploited

01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:06.240
is that what that means

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:08.240
that's what I heard

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.240
they get these ladies and they give them

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:12.240
all their bank account information

01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:14.240
and all their financial information

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:16.240
so the women apparently have control

01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:18.240
over the finances of the men

01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:20.240
and then they get off by

01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:22.240
the women paying their bills

01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:24.240
and not spending too much for themselves

01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:26.240
well that's like an extreme

01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:28.240
I've seen some of that

01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:30.240
you see the women

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:32.240
send me your money

01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:34.240
I saw documentaries about

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:36.240
it's like

01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:38.240
it could just be expensive gifts

01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:40.240
you're constantly sending them expensive gifts

01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:42.240
and stuff

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.240
and they're telling you you dumb shit

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:46.240
giving me all your money and then the guys are like

01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:48.240
oh I know

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:50.240
interesting

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:52.240
so that's your thing Steve

01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:54.240
the

01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:56.240
the delicious

01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:58.240
frosting that grows on the bottom

01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:00.240
of the glass ceiling

01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:02.240
it's got to be some

01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:04.240
advantage

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:06.240
what about this like what if you had like a locket

01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:08.240
around your like you were given this like necklace

01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:10.240
with a key in it and you don't know what it is

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:12.240
but you know it's an important thing

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:14.240
that was like a destiny

01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:16.240
a destiny key

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:18.240
that's cool

01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:20.240
also

01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:22.240
that's it

01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:26.240
like somebody just gave you a key

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:28.240
at one point and said here's the deal

01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:30.240
giving you a key

01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:32.240
every time you think this is full of shit

01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:34.240
it's a test and you'll fucking die

01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:36.240
the minute you

01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:38.240
are you saying like he's walking over the key that's like just a mind fuck

01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:40.240
it was like given to him like when he was

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.240
too young to remember

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.240
it's like you know you give a locket

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.240
like with half of an inscription in it

01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:48.240
like one thing you'll find on the other side

01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:50.240
it's a secret or something

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.240
the village was killed and then he was left with a key

01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:56.240
see what?

01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:58.240
a keyhole

01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:00.240
somebody gave him a keyhole

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:02.240
there's a keyhole on my chest

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.240
oh yeah

01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:06.240
there's a hole in you that shaped like a keyhole

01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:08.240
that's good

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:10.240
so there's a keyhole in my chest

01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:12.240
it's like a wound

01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:14.240
but your dick is shaped exactly like that key

01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:16.240
and I won't tell him

01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:18.240
I keep looking at it

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:20.240
I catch the light

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:22.240
and then I check that

01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:24.240
that's three prongs

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:26.240
I don't know how many times I have to look at it before I realize

01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:28.240
that's my dick's

01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:30.240
hole

01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:32.240
how many people have a key dick?

01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.240
you have to like take a lot of yoga

01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:36.240
to like be flexible enough to fuck your own chest

01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.240
he's always bowing

01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:44.240
I mean

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:46.240
he really has a hole in his chest

01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:48.240
like is it infected?

01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:50.240
no it's a keyhole, it's magic

01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:52.240
it's a magic keyhole in his chest

01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:54.240
like Iron Man

01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:56.240
oh

01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:58.240
sounds unique

01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:00.240
was that being derivative? I didn't know that was a thing

01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:02.240
no

01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:04.240
he's got an arc reactor

01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:06.240
he has a magic keyhole in his chest

01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:08.240
was it there when you woke up

01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:10.240
from your village being burnt?

01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:12.240
I don't remember

01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:14.240
it was an eight layer dip

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:18.240
that's the secret

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:20.240
yeah

01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:22.240
you've been told if you ever unlock that

01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:24.240
inside there's a recipe for the perfect eight layer dip

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:28.240
he's probably been told a lot of stuff

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.240
you go to

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.240
a flea market

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:34.240
and there's a fortune teller

01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:36.240
and you're like by the way I should probably show you this

01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:38.240
and they're like oh I know all about that

01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:40.240
and you're like yeah you and everyone else

01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:42.240
you know so he's probably heard a lot of shit

01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:44.240
but you have a hole in your chest

01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:46.240
it's shaped like a key

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:48.240
and I'm ever searching for

01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:50.240
the key that'll fit

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:52.240
into my heart hole

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:54.240
keyhole

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:56.240
no

01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.240
that's adorable

01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:04.240
I love that

01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:10.240
campaign

01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:12.240
wrap

01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:14.240
it's 10-11

01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:16.240
that's what I'm saying

01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:18.240
oh jeez it's late

01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:20.240
it's a long time

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:22.240
Zach you gotta beat

01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:24.240
he's gotta beat

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:26.240
fast rap

01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:32.240
yo

01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:34.240
oh shit

01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:36.240
it's about that time

01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:38.240
you know

01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:40.240
sometimes you come at me

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:42.240
I start thinking about the old days

01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:44.240
thinking about what you did to me

01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:46.240
in the old days

01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:48.240
when my heart felt

01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:50.240
when we used to feel

01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:52.240
when you used to come around

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:54.240
to the break of dawn

01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:56.240
when these used to be

01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:58.240
I thought I could just start rapping

01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:00.240
I thought

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.240
I was doing better at the

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:04.240
I was doing better at the

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:06.240
if I start doing that again

01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:08.240
this time and I know

01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:10.240
you can't unring that bell

01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.240
when you start trying

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:14.240
but

01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:16.240
no

01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:18.240
I think about

01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:20.240
how you used to feel

01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:22.240
how we used to be like family

01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:24.240
you know what I'm saying

01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:26.240
seems like things are

01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:28.240
changing so fast

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:30.240
we don't know who we are anymore

01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:32.240
until the break of dawn

01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:34.240
yeah

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:36.240
okay that one was fake

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:38.240
and I would try to make it seem like the first time

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:40.240
was a part of a bit

01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:42.240
seems like I'm always trying

01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:44.240
to rap good but

01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:46.240
trying to rise above it, trying to come outside of it

01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.240
never gonna rap good if you try

01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:50.240
to be outside of it

01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:52.240
give it up to your DJ Diarrhea Jr everybody

01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:54.240
DJ Diarrhea Jr

01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:56.240
it seems like

01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.240
hop down to the

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:00.240
side to the inside

01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:02.240
outside

01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:04.240
two feet wide, two feet tall

01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:06.240
that makes a cube

01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.240
my dick is covered in pubes

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:10.240
I wanna go outside the cube

01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:12.240
make another geometric shape

01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:14.240
I'm an ape that came onto this planet

01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:16.240
fight too late to make it a planet

01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:18.240
makes me so sad when I look at your mama's pussy

01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:20.240
it looks bad

01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:22.240
but it's beautiful

01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:26.240
those clinical drawings that you see in sex ed

01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:28.240
no one has a pussy like that

01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:30.240
what is that

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:32.240
a line

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.240
that's not a pussy

01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:36.240
your pussy should look like chewing gum

01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:38.240
it's okay

01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:40.240
roast beef

01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:42.240
roast beef, chewing gum

01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:44.240
scrambled eggs to your knees

01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:46.240
your labia

01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:48.240
could be shaped like Arabia

01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:52.240
doesn't matter

01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:54.240

everybody's shaped in different ways

02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:08.240
I fucked your mama so hard, no I didn't

02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:12.240

02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:14.240
to the break of dawn

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:16.240
to the break of dawn

02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:20.240

02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:22.240
