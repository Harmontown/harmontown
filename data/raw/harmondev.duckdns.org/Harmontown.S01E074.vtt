00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
BOOM BOOM GOW! BABY GOT THE POW!

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
BOOM BOOM GOW! BABY GOT THE POW!

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
BOOM BOOM GOW! BABY GOT THE POW!

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Welcome to Harmontown!

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
From Meltdown Comics, Hollywood, California, Harmontown is once again in session.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
Please welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Jen Harmon!

00:32.000 --> 00:45.000
BOOM BOOM BOOM!

00:45.000 --> 00:55.000
BOOM BOOM!

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
Alright, that is my response to record low attendance.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
A small but an alert crowd.

01:10.000 --> 01:21.000
I have performed for four people once, and it was one of the greatest shows I've ever done.

01:21.000 --> 01:30.000
When I was doing a professional improv in Milwaukee, one of my gigs was I was summoned to the living room

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
of a woman who my agent told me, I had an agent, an improv agent.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
She told me in Monday Carter that we would be performing for, I'm sorry, I said for six people,

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
because she said it's three couples, and the reason they're getting together,

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
and they want to have a quiet evening at home, and the reason is because one of the wives

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
and one of the three couples has just been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
So will you please go to their home and will you please do some improv for them in their living room?

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
And can I get 10% of that action?

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
And it was a great show, it was great.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
There's no stories to tell there, I'm just saying.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
This show is irregularly light because of one reason.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Possibly because of Breaking Bad Finale, maybe.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Definitely.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
Or maybe just because of slow entropy, maybe because, maybe it's for the same reason

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
that there's not as much gasoline when you pull oil out of the earth.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Maybe we've condensed, maybe these are the real harmonians.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah, I'd like to think that the people here tonight are the real Harmontown fans.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
This is the night, this is the night where it all comes together.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Or it's people who have Monday off, or it's people who...

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah, this is the night where we actually go to the moon.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
And the fucking other 60 people that didn't come are going to miss the boat.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
That's it.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
We're taking a moon boat.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Moon boat?

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
We're going to row through a Milky Wave stream of starlight.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Flavored dreams.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
With a paddle of love.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
No, we're going to get deep, we're going to get intimate.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
We're going to make it the best show ever.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
And people who didn't come here tonight are going to, they don't deserve to be punished,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
but they should know that they never know.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
They'll be old and they'll be on a rocking chair at a veranda somewhere,

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
and they'll think, I chose Breaking Bad over that Harmontown.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
And I went there 70 times and didn't come to that one.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And that is why I failed.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
They'll be on the porch next to another person on a rocking chair and that person will go,

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
the premiere of Breaking Bad's finale was on iTunes two days before that night.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
And they'll go, really?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
They'll go, yep, sure as this lemonade's sweet.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Are we really on a porch?

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
No, we're in an alien holographic four-dimensional storage unit.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Our species has long been enslaved by lizards.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
It won't matter.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
But we need not worry about crowd volume.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
We have to worry about morality.

04:22.000 --> 04:29.000
We have to worry about the pudding inside, in which lay the proof.

04:29.000 --> 04:37.000
The pudding inside your skulls, where this weird pudding network that we don't understand yet

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
creates the perceived difference between good and bad.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I was just listening to a radio lab on the way here,

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
which is where I get all of my information that doesn't have anything to do with me or community.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
And they were telling this story about this guy.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I'm 20 minutes into it and I'm already riveted.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
He had seizures and so he had part of his brain removed.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Then he had another part of his brain removed and then all of a sudden the cop started his door

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
because he's got kitty porn on his hard drive because his personality shifted and changed.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
What was fascinating to me is whether or not his personality shifted and changed.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
What's most fascinating to me is that I'm listening to a podcast that's produced by people

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
that are saying, let's figure this out.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Let's figure out whether or not this person is a good or bad person

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
or when he became a good or bad person or what defines good or bad behavior.

05:32.000 --> 05:40.000
Are we living in a world where we all constantly can't wait to jump on the Internet

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
and look at naked pictures of three-year-olds or are we living in a world where that is not the case

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
and therefore there needs to be an understanding.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
That's something weird is going on in your head if that's going on.

05:54.000 --> 06:03.000
Do we regard every single thing that you do that is not compatible with the Borg cube

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
as being a malady on your part?

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
Do we then forgive you and having forgiven you, do we try to cure you?

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
All of these are rhetorical questions.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
None of them have answers.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
This is the root of what we're doing.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
This is what society is.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
All of us have this pudding in our brain.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
All of us think at one time or another, oh, I'm going to go up to that guy.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
I'm going to say good morning.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Okay, well, that's been approved.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
That's fine.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
That's on a ticker tape.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
You're going to be the 500 millionth person to say good morning to another person.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
You have zero chance of going wrong there.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
The other person says good morning back.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Zero chance again of going wrong there.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Now at some point, if you want to climb up the ladder,

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
if you want to get closer to the papaya than the chimp above you,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
you have to start risking things.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
You have to start doing things differently.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
You have to start expressing yourself.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Good morning.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Too cloudy though yesterday.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
There's a risk there that the guy in front of you will go,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
what the fuck are you talking about?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Everything will go crazy.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Men with kevlar vests will come in and grab you and say,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
why did you think it was too cloudy yesterday?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Why did you think that?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
What is wrong with you?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
You need to go to prison.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
You need to go to a hospital disguised as a prison.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
You need to go to a prison disguised as a hospital.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
You need to be crucified.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
You need to be apologetic.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
You need to be fixed.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
What is our goal?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
What is our end game?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
What do we expect of each other?

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
When we see another human being on the street,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
do we want them to be like us?

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Or do we want them to be different?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I think the answer is probably,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Goldberg, will you fucking cool it with the package?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
It's a bag of Cheetos.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I'm recording the value.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Is that you, Adam Goldberg?

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
99 cents for a bag of sunships that expenses the whole show.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
He's crinkling and crinkling.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
The whole time you're talking,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
there's a sound of one person eating chips louder

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
than chips need to be eaten.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
So do we want to fix him?

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
I think, and Adam, if you come on stage,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm going to put you at a full Nelson.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
He was eating chips loud on purpose, right?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
No, no.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I opened them after you said that.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Willfully loud chip eating.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Willfully loud chip eating.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Because you're in the fourth row for the first time ever.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
You came here late and didn't get in the second row.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
So you're eating chips at a fourth row level right now.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
You yell at me, and it's worth it.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Keep it fucking down, man.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Good advice.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
So anyways, I've driven in here.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
I have to write something down you said.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Much the same as the riboflavin and salt

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
in that bag of chips has made Adam uncontrollably...

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Go on, I'm just starting a page with my thing.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
My search for truth has made me...

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
You don't have to put your hand that far in the bag

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
to get a chip out of it.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
The bag is bigger than your wrist.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
You can delicately insert your hand into a bag of chips.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Now I feel bad that I outed him.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
No, it's too much.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
No, not that loud, though. You haven't.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
You haven't ever been that loud.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Because you would feel terrible if you saw other people

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
heard you eating the chip.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
He wants you to know he ate the chip.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
You think he wants you to know he ate the chip?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Yes, he does.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Adam Goldberg demands that you know that he has chips.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
And now we're talking about it,

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
and now he's ascending into heaven right now.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
He's sitting at the left hand of God.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Alright, well, I want to keep talking about

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
the weird tapioca in our brains

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
and what our end game is.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
What are we supposed to do?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I want to talk about morality.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Because there's something different...

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Notice how quiet it is right now?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
It's fine, which is good.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Are all the chips gone?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, Jeff, you did great.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Adam, are you done with your chips?

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Do you want to pour them into a bowl?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Now he's nodding in silence.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
We've martyred him. He's behind the rock.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
He's Joan of Arc.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
We'll roll it aside in three days and he'll take over.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
I want to talk about...

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
You know, so often the big thing that it comes down to

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
is we've got these big giant brains

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
and we figure out the things we can do.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
You can put a human ear on the back of a mouse.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
You can wear glasses.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Now you can read a book. There's a light bulb.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Now, nighttime isn't nighttime anymore.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Honestly, science wins.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
It's the better religion.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Particularly because of the way it pursues its endeavors.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
You lock hands and you say, what don't we know?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Let's figure out how to know it.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Let's not trust any crackpot who happens to be charismatic.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Just because he has weird hair and his tongue can hang out

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
and the posters and Spencer's gifts

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
doesn't mean that he's a better scientist.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Everything is peer-reviewed.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Everything is hypothesis and testing and proof.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
And it's always up for debate, always up for act checking.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
And slowly but surely, like an amber alert,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
we will close in on God and we will find him

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
and we will grab him and hug him for a second

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
and then slap his face and go,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
do you know how much you worried me?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
That's science and that's the religion I approve of

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
when it comes to a relationship with the unknown.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
However, what it lacks, what it constantly lacks,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
what it conveniently lacks is this thing

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
that for lack of a better word

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
and there is a sincere, severe lack of a better word, morality.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
That other thing, that feely thing,

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
the umbilical thing, the thing that connects you

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
to the unknown thing, the thing that makes you go,

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
yeah, but neither of these things

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
can be given control over us.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
We're so smart, we keep figuring out how to do stuff,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
we keep learning new things about why we are the way we are

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
and every time we do, we go, okay,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
that means that nothing means anything anymore

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
and then the other people are always going,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
yeah, but everything's always meant to everything

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
and that means that you shouldn't even be learning these things

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
and they're all assholes, we're all fucking idiots.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
So we're not going to get to the bottom of it tonight

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
but before we go to the moon, we've got to get our shit straight.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
We've got to understand what constitutes,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
because I've said a million times before,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
a dollar is a dollar, a dollar is worth 100 pennies

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
and a penny is worth a penny and that is fine, capitalism works fine

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
but we have to say that the human life is worth more than all of that.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
It has to be a separate tier, it cannot be,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
that's the flaw of capitalism, it's the flaw of humanity

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
to the extent that it embraces capitalism.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
So the big question has to be before we get to the moon,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
we better know if somebody hits their head on a rock

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
and they start going, I used to like purple, now I like yellow,

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
yeah, but commander, all the controls are set for purple

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
and yeah, but yellow's the best.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
Oh shit, we have to know what we define as human.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Is it efficacy? Is it utility?

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
Beef steak bill, who's been reborn from beef fungus pills,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
raising his hand slightly.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
It's our ability to choose.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
You better come up if you, this is heavy stuff.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Beef steak bill.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
It's heavier than Breaking Bad, I think.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
So far, yeah.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
I mean, what's he going to do?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
He's going to use the machine gun in his trunk.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
He's going to use it on one of three characters that are left.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
You've been playing GTA.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah, I have, but also listening to Radio Labs

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
about people having seizures that turn into pedophiles

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
because certain sections of their brain are cut.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
What were you saying about free will, Bill?

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Okay, I was watching a YouTube video from a Harvard professor

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
who said, who seemed to think that the thing that we value the most

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
is our ability to choose and to take away somebody else's ability

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
to choose is, by far, the biggest crime you could ever make.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Because our entire religion, no matter,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
and I think this spans the entire globe,

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
every single origin myth has to do with humanity diverting from

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
a sort of, what would you call it, a nothingness

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
by virtue of our desire to choose or our curse to choose.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
And at that point, God, I mean, the easiest example is Genesis.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
God says, you chose.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Now, for the rest of your life, you choose.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Fuck you.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Giraffes don't choose.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Wolves don't choose.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Moss doesn't choose.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Have fun choosing in pieces of shit.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
And they don't have labor pains.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Your women now will.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah, and now you're going to take a hoe to the earth

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
and it's going to, you're going to break your back for nothing.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
You're going to, everything you're going to experience.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You're a piece of shit because,

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
but in the warning to God before we ate that apple,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
somebody said, you know, in that smoky room,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
in one of the versions of Genesis said,

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
oh, they're going to be like us.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
If they eat that fruit.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
That's a bit out there for me to follow.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Like, I don't know how to follow that.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
That's the same, theologically, just like supporting that,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
like for thousands of years, but continue, please.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
There are some examples in the animal kingdom of cooperation

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and there's, strangely enough,

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
there's also examples of animals fucking each other over.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
One example is where they had two elephants

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
who were given a rope to pull

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
and they had a pulley on it so that

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
if both of the elephants pulled at the same time,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
they would bring the food to them.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
And if only one of them pulled it,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
the rope would just go through the pulley.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
So, you know, the elephants didn't take too long

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
to figure out that they could cooperate and bring it over,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
but it wasn't too long after that

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
that one of the elephants figured out

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
that if he just put his foot on the rope,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
the other elephant would do all the work.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
You know the same test they did with chimpanzees?

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
The exact same test.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
But it wasn't a foot on the rope,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
it was simply not cooperation.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
It was the alpha chimp would go over

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
and unlock the beta chimp and say,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
okay, same deal, let's bring the food to me.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
And the beta chimp, having been through

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
one iteration of the test,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
oh, you mean the test where you get all the food?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Fuck off.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
And there's also been tests with monkeys

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
where they give cucumber and grapes,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
and then if you underpay

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
or give one set of monkeys the cucumber,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
they get angry that you didn't give them grapes.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
So that's sort of the long and the same line.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
But while you were talking about all that,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
it reminded me of something

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I'd been thinking about for a while.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
That is the pillars of morality.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
And there's a lot of people who talk about it

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
in different ways,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
and a lot of people say like,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
there's seven pillars of morality.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
There's like the seven deadly sins

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
and things like that they used to illustrate.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
But the two pillars of morality for me

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
are reciprocity and empathy.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
And you can't have just one of those two things.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
You need both of them.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
The empathy allows you to know how to behave,

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
and the reciprocity is you actually doing it.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Like you have to know that person needs a hug.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
The reason that person is doing that

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
is because they want to hug,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
and then you have to hug them.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Empathy is broken into two separate,

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
or yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
I'm sorry if I haven't thought about this for a while now.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
There's...

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Oh, brain freeze.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Talk, talk.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Choice.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
You were holding a 40 ounce beer in your lap earlier.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
Was that a 40 in a brown paper bag you were holding?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Yes.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I love you for that, by the way.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Everybody should have a 40 ounce in a brown paper bag.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
You know, the government has beaten you to that idea.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
It's not turning out so good.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
What exactly does reciprocity mean?

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Reciprocity, I mean, linguistically,

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
it just means paying back whatever's been paid to you.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Kind of a quid pro quo.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
If I get something, I give something in return for that.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
It could mean, it's not a moral attachment,

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
if you punch me in the face,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I'm reciprocating by punching you back in the face.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
If you kiss me, I reciprocate by pitching you.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
And from a societal level,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
reciprocity doesn't necessarily mean

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
that you pay the person who gave you something back,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
but you can pay it forward as it were.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
So reciprocity isn't necessarily isolated

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
to the two people involved in the transaction.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Oh, well, now you're beyond me.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
It's a future tense, reciprocity?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Yeah, yeah, that's how I think about it.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Maybe I'm wrong and it may be goofy,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
but the way that I think about it,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
you know, I think as illustrated by my giving people stuff,

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
is like, I feel like reciprocity is more represented by Gandhi

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
and the idea that you sort of move things into the world

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
and then the world becomes like that.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh, so acting as if everything is the way that it should be.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Then the world reciprocates.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Yeah, you're going like, okay,

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
well, I'm not going to fall for the devil temptation

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
of saying, well, what if this and what if that?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I'm going to do the thing that I would do

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
if everybody did what everyone was supposed to do,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
which is what someone does when they pick up an aluminum can

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
and drops it in a recycling bin in spite of knowing

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
that that single action will absolutely not stop anything

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
that's going to make the earth die.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Like, that person, what they're doing is they're,

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
you're saying that that can be called reciprocation.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I didn't know that.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
So the other thing I was talking about,

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
an empathy is broken into two different components.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
There is affective, I think it is, and perceptive.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
And one type of empathy is your ability to perceive

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
how another person feels,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
and the other one is your ability to know what to do

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
to make the person feel better.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
And so without one of those two components,

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
you end up with either sociopaths who actually know what to do,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
but don't feel that they should,

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
or you end up with autistic people who know what to do,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
but have no idea when to do it.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
The latter is if you know everything that everyone wants

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
all the time and you hate them for it,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
is that that you're probably autistic, right?

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
Like, you're not a sociopath, for sure.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
You're definitely more towards autistic.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Can you do a Jeff Fox with the comedy routine?

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
You might be autistic.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
It wouldn't be as funny as Jeff Fox with his movies.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
What was yours?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Can't make eye contact.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Yes, if you can't make eye contact,

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
but you know that you should, you might be autistic.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
If someone tells you that they need a hug from you

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
to make themselves feel better,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
and your thought is that you should respect me more,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
you might be autistic.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah, it's not funny.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
It's a diagnosis.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
Diagnoses aren't funny.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
If you know the diagnosis, isn't funny.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
All right, thank you, Beef Steak Bill.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Beef Steak Bill!

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
Beef Steak Bill used to be Beef Fungus Bill,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
and then he was lowered to the Lava,

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
and he emerged as the Galvatron.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
It's possible to reinvent yourself here.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Erin did a very...

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
I mean, we spent 45 minutes talking about him.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Yeah, I listened to that. It was fantastic.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
How many levels will he have to go through

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
to get Beef out of his nickname?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Who knows?

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
He may one day end up being just like...

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Dr. Beef.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
Maybe the next level is he just issues Bill.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
He already has only one L in the word Bill.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
That's vestigial. That can go.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Let's bring our good friends to the stage

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
faster than normal tonight, as I got Nathan,

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
but I want to talk to them about brain-putting

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
and morality and choices,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
and how you know the difference between good and bad,

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
because we have a quiet, intimate, awesome audience,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
and we're going to get to the fucking...

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
We're going to make everyone jealous next episode.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
We're embarking to the moon tonight.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Well, psychologically.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Yes.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I want everybody who comes next week,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
everyone who listens to go,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
shit, fuck, are you kidding me?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
For breaking bad, I missed this?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Yeah.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
What the people listening don't know

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
is that you've had your shirt off the entire time.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
All right, Kumail Nanjiani, can you come out here?

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Can you come out here?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Hello, hello.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Nice. I like that.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Kumail's wearing a t-shirt that has a very...

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Is this a new thing, the kind of watermark logo?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Oh, does it look watermark?

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
It's just a free t-shirt I got at this place.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
It says the conjuring on it.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Do you think that's typical to that film,

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
that it's sort of faded into the thread of the shirt,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
or is that a new thing?

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I think the movie... Have you seen the movie?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
No.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
It sort of captures the vibe of the movie.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Schrab talked about it last week.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Did you like it?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I don't think so. I can't remember.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
You liked it?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I have a theory on morality.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I don't know, it's not a novel.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
But I think what makes us human

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
is complexity of language and society,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
and I think morality is just what you need

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
to live in a society.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
And how I think it ties into science

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
is that the brains that are made

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
to sort of be able to differentiate right and wrong,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
i.e. what works in a society and what doesn't,

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
are the ones evolutionarily that will stick around.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
So for instance, if you have a brain that makes you fuck kids,

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
you're not going to have any more kids,

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
because kids can't have kids, so you'll go away.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
So I think that's...

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Wait, wait, wait.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Kids can't have kids?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Like, you know, like a three-year-old,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I don't think they can have a kid.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
And I don't think pedophiles, I think,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
draw the line at like 14, because then

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
I think that's when we kind of take over, you know?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Not that we're excited about this.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Listen, come on, bro.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Everybody!

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Don't bro me. Don't bro me on 14.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
You've seen some 16-year-olds where you're like,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
all right.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
You said 14 first, by the way.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I was trying to make a point.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Well, you know with the hormones in milk these days,

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
and I don't know.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
See, but look how fun it is to frolic in that surf.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
And we all go, ah, you, ah, da, da, da, da, da.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
And then there's the six-foot drop-off

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
that we all go, don't go out there.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Well, but I really don't think it's that

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
if all of us want to do it, and we know not to,

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
I think it's a messed up broken brain that wants to do it.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Because evolutionarily and scientifically,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
it doesn't make sense to be attracted to a child.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
It's not what leads to the survival of our species.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
So when he got that thinker out of his brain,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
it fucked him up.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
By the way, we should all be lucky that we hit the lottery

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
of not being attracted to kids.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
Like, that could have been something that could have happened to us.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
But this is what I'm talking about.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
Why do we act like they are, like,

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
and first I'm gonna say, this is a daisy chain of weird logic

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
that I want to lead probably to nowhere

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
because greater men than me have tried to think about this.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
But the first link in the daisy chain is to go,

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
why do we act like a guy who wants to fuck a three-year-old

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
is the same as a Nazi war criminal

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
that we're trying to hunt down and go,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
no, you fucked up.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
You thought you were back in the right horse.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
You made a choice.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Because they did make a choice to fuck a kid.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
You can want to fuck a kid.

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
No, no, no. Okay, well, let's wipe that off the magnet board.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
Yeah, like actually hurting a kid, affecting their future,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
which then vampirically turns them probably

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
as we've seen into another abuser of children.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
That's the problem. That's 90% of the problem.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
But the impulse itself, the hard drive,

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
the guy who wants to look at a calendar

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
where January is a three-year-old kid

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
laying on a rug in front of a fireplace.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
All right.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Okay, so...

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
I feel like the printer would have a couple questions,

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
but I don't know if you can mass-produce that.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Is the money calendar ready?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
That's kind of a DIY kind of thing.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
Yeah, collage scissors.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
The impulse, the predilection, like why...

27:49.000 --> 27:55.000
I know the answer, I think, is because it's easy.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
Because we all, as Americans, we lack...

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
And humans.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
We lack outlets for outrage.

28:03.000 --> 28:11.000
We think we're encouraged to be fucking loud.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
We're encouraged to...

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
Emily Post did not write the rules to American society.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
It's sort of very ethnocentric,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
it's just knowing what's happening here.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Yeah, and what's happening here

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
has been happening here for the last eight years.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
If you go back further than eight years now,

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
this is like Alexis de Tocqueville on Overdrive,

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
what came before us, we have no respect for it.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
We spit on it.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
We don't care.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
If you, like John Ritter, you thought he was funny,

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
go fuck yourself.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
We've burrowed into ourselves,

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
and have originally, us doing that,

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
took over the planet.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
We said fuck culture, fuck bloodlines,

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
fuck heredity, fuck everything,

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
but what's going on right here, right now,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
and it was a glorious...

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Thomas Edison took that ball and ran with it.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
This is sort of a weird thing,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
but right after September 11th, 2001,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I can't believe I have to specify that,

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
but I was here and I had some...

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
I sort of podcast listeners, I'm a brown-skinned man.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I had people yell stuff at me,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
and a lot of times, and this is just what happened,

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
I'm not putting any judgment on any sort of higher point,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
except that there were a lot of black people

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
who said really bad stuff to me,

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
and I'm like, you should understand what discrimination feels like,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
because you go through it every day.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Why can you not put yourself in my shoes

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
and understand that it's the same thing that's happening?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
It's because we just want to...

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I don't know what it is.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It's like there's the kick-the-dog theory,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
that any pain that's put on you,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
if you get yelled at by your boss,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
you yell the person beneath him, and he yells at his wife,

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
and she yells at the son, the son kicks the dog,

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
and the dog can't...

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Right now, we're the dog.

30:10.000 --> 30:18.000
Do you think that if a black person exalts in doing that to you,

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
is that just kind of like the joy of having someone to do that to you?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
It's reciprocation.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Without empathy.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
It's patriotic reciprocation.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Paying it forward.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Paying it forward.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
I think that is the history of...

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
White racists are fond of evoking turn of the century,

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
kind of like,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
remember what the Irish did and the Jewish had to do?

30:45.000 --> 30:52.000
When they hear the reverse-reverse racism often is...

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
The idea is,

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
oh, all kinds of people had it bad over here in this melting pot.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
What they're sort of lifting up

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
and celebrating is actually part of the problem,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
which is that shit rolls down ill,

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
that you don't end up,

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
when you've been at the end of a stick,

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
you typically do not end up grabbing the stick out of the hand

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
that's holding it and beating the face of the person that held it.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
You typically end up kind of coming into your own,

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
like, oh, I got a little star in my chest now.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Remember, when I was just getting hit,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
now I'm hitting people,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
but it's not typically the guy that was hitting you.

31:34.000 --> 31:40.000
But I think it's interesting to sort of think of morality as...

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
You know, if you think of it,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
you said something,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
oh, why do we judge people, not judge,

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
but why do we demonize people who are attracted to kids?

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
Because it's against what makes a society work,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
because it gets fucked up kids

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
and these kids are not going to go to war.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
But why don't we look at them the same way we look at someone who has a cold?

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
When someone has snot dripping down their face,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
which makes them disgusting,

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
because it's easier, but if someone walks in...

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Wait, you can't say it's easier to judge pedophiles and walk on stage.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
Like, it's a big victory lap.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
No, but here's what it...

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Adam, it must be said to the listener,

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
is standing one-third the way toward the stage right now.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
He can only be described as an ominous pose.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I really...

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
I think he's being sated himself on chips.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
Because I think being attracted to kids is not a crime.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Acting on it is.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
No, no, wait, yeah, that's... Yes.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Yeah, and so I think those people,

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
our brains are made, oh, hey, Adam.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Hello, Adam.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
For a different perspective.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I agree with Kamel's point,

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
but I want to say the reason that it's so easy to kick shit down...

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
By the way, I just want to say one thing.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
There's not a lot of people here,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
but don't say anything you'll regret.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
Don't reveal too much while you're defending.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
No, it's because the reason that it's so fun to be like,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
well, I was being kicked around school,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I used to be bullied, now I'm the bully,

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
is because you see the part of yourself that's ready to be bullied again.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
You have to fill yourself up with the confidence that says,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
well, I'm not going to be victimized,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
because I'm victimizing someone else that hard.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
It's the same reason we have a lot of closeted religious people,

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
and they're the ones who are most going after homosexuals.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
And I also... Yeah, sorry.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Yeah, you use your rage.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
It feels good to turn someone else into the scapegoat,

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
because you're not the scapegoat.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Because everyone has the same fiber in their being.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
We all have the same biological organism.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
We all have the same teeth in our mouth,

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
and we all have the same weird fucking aggressive bullshit.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
But the weird thing is, all of us have to take shits.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I've said this a million times before,

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
I say certain things, and as people say,

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
yeah, but people want to do this,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
especially about my thoughts about hierarchy.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
And I'm very, very like...

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
I don't want to say resentful of this,

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
but when I talk about hierarchy,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
when I talk about anarchy versus hierarchy,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
and anarchy is simply, it's not lawlessness,

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
it's not lack of order, it's simply the lack of hierarchy.

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
And then I'll get the Reddit sub thread thing,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
like people will chime in from Alaska,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
from their little dungeons.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Well, Dan Harmon, if you don't like hierarchy,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
why do you have a Harmontown?

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
How about that?

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Yeah, exactly.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Why are you standing and talking in a stage?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Is that the opposite of blah, blah, blah, blah?

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
Isn't hierarchy inherent to human beings?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Isn't it instinctive?

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
Shit-taking is inherent to human beings.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
Poop comes out of your butt so many times a day.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
We are not walking around in an average way.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
How many times on average?

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
That should be average of one.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Six to seven.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Whoa, okay.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
We should talk about that first.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
If we're going to be in a spaceship to the moon together.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
We were going to make it to the moon,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
but then Dan shit into our toilet.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Believe me, Harmontown won the castle that goes first.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
That is just your shit.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
It's 90% bathroom.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Well, here's the thing, I think the ultimate sort of...

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Because there's going to be a tub in there.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
It's not going to shower while we're going to the moon.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
I think human nature, which is what you're talking about,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Goldberg and you guys are talking about,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
which is sort of the urge to be better than someone,

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
is so at odds with what a just sustainable society is.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
That's the problem, I think.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
If you think of the Nazi society, that's not a sustainable society.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Taliban, that's not a sustainable society.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Sustainable society has no hierarchy like what you're saying.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
I think there are people that would say that compassion,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
there was a community that was compassionate

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
and they cared for the elderly and they looked after the sick

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
and they dealt as a group with criminal elements

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
or maybe psychotic or psychopathic elements or antisocial elements.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
That would be great.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
That would be awesome, but nothing would get invented,

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
nothing would get done.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I think people say that it's that drive,

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
that competition, that capitalist competitiveness

36:08.000 --> 36:13.000
creates our ability to grow and to drive to succeed.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
I think may or may not be true,

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
but I think what societies lack,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
especially when capitalism is involved,

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
is simple compassion because it's not sexy,

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
it doesn't get anybody anywhere.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
There's no reciprocity in that.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
There's no barter system in compassion.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
That should be the paying forward of if I do something right

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
and the golden rule.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
I think all major religions say in some way or other,

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
do unto others what you'd have them do unto you.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
Some say don't do unto others what you wouldn't want them to do to you,

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
but I think the better way to say it is to actually go out of your way

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
and do something that you're doing for no profit at all

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
because it profits many.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
Society, that's the most basic candidate that society is built on.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Do unto others what you would have them do.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
You watch people, especially in big cities,

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
and let's say you're a creative person, you're an artist,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
you're a writer, you're a painter,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
and you're driven to do something creative,

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
and you're watching people that have this other thing called ambition,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
and they're not as talented as you,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
but they're really fucking good in a room,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
and they're really driven.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
They're at a party.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You should be talking to that person.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
No, I don't like talking to people.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
I like painting. I'll go home and paint for fucking free.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
You sit home and watch the Emmys, and you watch a bunch of people

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
that some got lucky and were artists and happened, and it all happened,

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
and you're surrounded in a room full of people that I think are absolute con artists

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
and bullies and dickheads.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
I'm going to go the other direction on this one for you, Jeff,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
because it's not a binary.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
It's not a binary between capitalist and anarchist

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
because a lot of the things that we give credit for for capitalism

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
happen under protectionist governments.

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
Happened because you couldn't buy grain from England for a lot of the 19th century

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
for the 20th century.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
You couldn't buy cars from Japan until suddenly you could,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
and then the 80s were filled with the idea,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
oh, Japan's going to take over.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
But the part that really, it's not a duality between being ambitious

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
and being creative.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
It's not a knob that you turn one way or the other.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
There's nothing wrong with getting paid what you're worth,

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
and there's nothing wrong with learning to be the person who talks a little,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
you know, kisses a little ass.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
The motivation is blind ambition.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
There's people that are motivated simply by the need to rise up a ladder.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
And that's society.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
That's, you know, that's Parisian culture and the restoration.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
I'm just simply using people to get your ends out of things.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
It's why Rome fell.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
But we've slid into, I mean, all these are choices.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
We're all choosing the words that we're going to say.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
We're all forming policy.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
We're going to talk politics.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
We're going to talk philosophy.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
We're going to talk about the people that came before us, the mistakes that they've

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
made, the problem with the way things are, the true motivation of the people around us

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
and all these things.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
But at the core, at the deeper core of that, we don't even have our shit together

39:07.000 --> 39:13.000
enough to look at a guy who hid his head so hard that he wants to fuck a three-year-old

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
and go, are you all right?

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
We want to arrest that person.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
That's the problem.

39:21.000 --> 39:27.000
Like, we can't endure the equivalent of a head cold in terms of personality.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
We can't allow anyone to have a bad day.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
Well then, okay, what do you propose we do with that person?

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
I don't know.

39:33.000 --> 39:40.000
I propose that we stop proposing because we are more jellyfish.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
We are 90% jellyfish.

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
We share more DNA with a watermelon than we do with whatever we haven't discovered yet.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
We are aqueous characters.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
We are things that flow.

39:53.000 --> 40:00.000
We just finished eating each other's faces and genitals off under a tree, fighting for

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
shade.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
We have risen so much.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
It was a great tree.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
It was a great tree.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
I'm talking about the 50s.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
That was the last Harmontown at the...

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
That's Sullivan Theatre.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
The 1950s were a rough time for all of us down.

40:14.000 --> 40:24.000
The idea that there's a threshold that we have to cross, the idea of being reminded of

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
our frailty, when you see somebody who's been bonked on the head, when you see somebody

40:27.000 --> 40:31.600
who's homeless, when you see somebody who's having a bad week or having a bad time, being

40:31.600 --> 40:33.000
reminded of our frailty is terrifying.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.240
How about being reminded of the fact that the conscious personality, the person that

40:37.240 --> 40:45.480
you interact with in line at a football stadium, when you engage in the wonderful, beautiful

40:45.480 --> 40:51.000
act of not ripping another primate's face off while you're waiting in line for a beer.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.600
When we drive to and from work every day, the entire planet, all these lights that you

40:56.600 --> 41:02.760
see as you fly in these aircraft that don't go down over these cities where there aren't

41:02.760 --> 41:09.560
explosions happening because it's not World War Z yet, be reminded of the fact that this

41:09.560 --> 41:15.000
outward face that creates all that compatibility, clearly by the fact that America's prison

41:15.000 --> 41:24.640
population is rising and rising and rising, we obviously are capable of functioning in

41:24.640 --> 41:31.480
society with repressing a certain amount of the animal within.

41:31.480 --> 41:38.080
We are now at a point where we need to grow up enough to accept the animal within.

41:38.080 --> 41:47.880
The internet is creating glory holes in the wall between everything that you're allowed

41:47.880 --> 41:54.560
to say in line at the bank and everything that you actually think and feel, and they're

41:54.560 --> 42:04.120
spurting out, like creating these little seismic, these yellow stones, and our reaction is

42:04.120 --> 42:08.760
we're flocking to those and we're going, look at this unfortunate, no, we're hitting

42:08.760 --> 42:12.000
them with hammers and then creating ones a little down the line that we can stick our

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
dicks in.

42:13.000 --> 42:20.240
We are obviously a gigantic eye, this is eyes wide shut, we are fucked up people.

42:20.240 --> 42:23.560
We are, but okay, here's going back to when I said, what do you propose we do?

42:23.560 --> 42:28.880
When you said, I propose to not propose, but how does society deal with someone who's fucking

42:28.880 --> 42:29.880
kids?

42:29.880 --> 42:32.600
Like, at the core of it, like what do you say we do?

42:32.600 --> 42:34.800
We have to demonize that person.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.800
Lauren take the stage.

42:35.800 --> 42:36.800
Sorry, I've been late.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.800
Finally, let's get a woman up on the stage of douchebag men, can we please?

42:39.800 --> 42:41.800
Yeah, I get your chair.

42:41.800 --> 42:49.800
Adam, you can, oh, she just, shit rolls downhill Lauren.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.080
Spencer to the stage to take Adam's mic away from him.

42:53.080 --> 42:54.080
Spencer.

42:54.080 --> 42:57.600
I think you, I think you know who you were in that metaphor.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.600
Yeah, get up there.

42:59.600 --> 43:00.600
Yeah.

43:00.600 --> 43:04.920
Adam tried to use Spencer's throne and I will not have that.

43:04.920 --> 43:05.920
I'm sorry.

43:05.920 --> 43:10.520
I've been really wanting to engage in this discussion because I lived in Amsterdam studying

43:10.520 --> 43:17.120
gender and sexuality for a while and we actually interviewed pedophiles, pedophiles.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.400
There was like the day that pedophiles.

43:18.400 --> 43:21.480
Did you lower them with like kids?

43:21.480 --> 43:25.200
Oh, hey, you're one, couple questions.

43:25.200 --> 43:29.720
Yeah, no, there was like, it was really weird.

43:29.720 --> 43:33.880
It was like on the syllabus, like the day that pedophiles are coming to class.

43:33.880 --> 43:37.360
And how did they, can I ask you one very basic question?

43:37.360 --> 43:41.400
When I think of pedophile in my head, I think I have a specific, what did they look like?

43:41.400 --> 43:42.400
Like that?

43:42.400 --> 43:43.400
Yes.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.400
Okay.

43:44.400 --> 43:47.400
Wait, they showed up saying, hello, I'm a, I'm a pedophile.

43:47.400 --> 43:49.840
They're out of the closet about it?

43:49.840 --> 43:50.840
Yeah.

43:50.840 --> 43:55.680
Some people don't like fucking kids and there's me, hi, James Robinson's the name, pedophilia

43:55.680 --> 43:56.680
is the game.

43:56.680 --> 43:57.680
Yeah.

43:57.680 --> 44:00.720
They were, this was the Netherlands.

44:00.720 --> 44:04.680
So you have to keep that in mind there, you know, well, they're, they're, they're, they're

44:04.680 --> 44:07.680
the Dutch have been fucking kids for centuries.

44:07.680 --> 44:12.520
You can just go into coffee shops where you find, there's whole, there's whole restaurants

44:12.520 --> 44:19.720
where it's just kids on platters and then it says, anyway, but they don't like pedophilia,

44:19.720 --> 44:20.720
right?

44:20.720 --> 44:21.720
Yeah.

44:21.720 --> 44:22.720
Like both of these guys had been to jail.

44:22.720 --> 44:23.720
Yeah.

44:23.720 --> 44:26.720
So there's a hard line between what they're open about and pedophilia, but go ahead.

44:26.720 --> 44:27.720
Sorry.

44:27.720 --> 44:31.480
No, what they're open about is talking about it and researching it and that sort of thing.

44:31.480 --> 44:36.200
Anyway, so, uh, yeah, they came to class and it was these two guys and one of them was

44:36.200 --> 44:40.960
like, yeah, I, you know, I, I really like five year old girls.

44:40.960 --> 44:41.960
It was creepy.

44:41.960 --> 44:45.480
Like, no, like I like had a big problem with it, but, but you're studying it.

44:45.480 --> 44:46.480
You're creepy about it.

44:46.480 --> 44:47.480
Yeah.

44:47.480 --> 44:48.480
Yeah.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.480
Okay.

44:49.480 --> 44:55.160
But what they talked about was their, you know, like their mission is to not fuck children.

44:55.160 --> 44:56.160
Yeah.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.160
So that's their struggle.

44:57.160 --> 44:58.800
I have to not run red lights.

44:58.800 --> 44:59.800
They have to not.

44:59.800 --> 45:05.040
I mean, I'm just saying we all have these struggles and the moral choice is to not do the immoral

45:05.040 --> 45:06.040
thing.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.040
Okay.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.040
Go ahead.

45:08.040 --> 45:09.320
And it didn't, like it didn't make them any less creepy.

45:09.320 --> 45:14.560
Like, like they, they talked openly about how like they had to work to avoid going to

45:14.560 --> 45:18.720
playgrounds and inviting little boys to sit on their lap and like, yeah.

45:18.720 --> 45:24.040
So, so their, their AA is saying like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm six months sober off of fucking

45:24.040 --> 45:25.040
children.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.040
Yeah.

45:26.040 --> 45:27.040
Yeah.

45:27.040 --> 45:28.040
Totally.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.560
And not just, not just fucking them, but like looking at them, you know, like they like

45:29.560 --> 45:32.320
have to like avoid situations where they're around children.

45:32.320 --> 45:33.320
Sure.

45:33.320 --> 45:34.320
Yeah.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.320
What were you going to say, Camille?

45:35.320 --> 45:36.320
Nothing.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.520
I, you know, like a little chip, like you get a little chip, like it's been six months

45:39.520 --> 45:44.040
and then everyone claps like, great, good for you.

45:44.040 --> 45:47.920
I had a relapse last night.

45:47.920 --> 45:48.920
But here's the thing.

45:48.920 --> 45:50.120
That's what I'm saying, Dan.

45:50.120 --> 45:54.360
I don't understand what you're saying when you say, like, well, how are you proposing

45:54.360 --> 45:55.360
we are?

45:55.360 --> 45:57.440
Why is our attitude towards pedophilia wrong?

45:57.440 --> 46:01.680
We've sat on the stage and talked about the, the topic of people who get turned down by

46:01.680 --> 46:06.080
eating shit or having being shit on or shitting on other people came up and immediately we

46:06.080 --> 46:10.880
defaulted to as hilarious as it is, like, like letting those people know, should one

46:10.880 --> 46:14.520
of them be in the audience, letting those people know that what they need to do is continue

46:14.520 --> 46:16.160
to be ashamed of themselves.

46:16.160 --> 46:21.360
I, at the same time, anytime we say something even slightly wrong politically, we get immediately

46:21.360 --> 46:26.120
fucking, you know, some poor girl came up here whose only crime was what?

46:26.120 --> 46:30.680
Being part of a fucking bell curve mentality, like saying something that eight years ago

46:30.680 --> 46:35.520
would have functioned as something that progressively to say about gay people are, and immediately

46:35.520 --> 46:40.680
got jumped on by this LA fucking, like, well, I wasn't here for that, but I think you can

46:40.680 --> 46:42.720
hold people accountable for their opinions.

46:42.720 --> 46:46.360
I think, I think people can be wrong, and it's okay to say that they're wrong.

46:46.360 --> 46:48.240
Again, I didn't listen to that episode, but...

46:48.240 --> 46:51.320
I said that people that want to be pooped on, people that want to be peed on, people

46:51.320 --> 46:54.320
that want to dress as a lizard, people that want to fuck a dog, people that want to suck

46:54.320 --> 46:55.320
a dog's dick.

46:55.320 --> 46:56.320
Okay.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.320
Okay.

46:57.320 --> 46:58.320
Now my dog's involved.

46:58.320 --> 46:59.320
Now your dog's involved.

46:59.320 --> 47:00.320
It's a fuzzy line.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.320
It's a fuzzy line.

47:01.320 --> 47:02.320
Is the dog into it?

47:02.320 --> 47:06.320
But we're not, we're not, I think the, I think the fundamental, like, plexiglass between

47:06.320 --> 47:10.680
my Indiana Jones and your Cobra right now is that...

47:10.680 --> 47:11.680
Why am I the Cobra?

47:11.680 --> 47:13.680
I'm the one against pedophiles.

47:13.680 --> 47:15.680
How am I the Cobra?

47:15.680 --> 47:16.680
You're right.

47:16.680 --> 47:17.680
Sorry.

47:17.680 --> 47:18.680
I'll flip them.

47:18.680 --> 47:19.680
I'll flip them.

47:19.680 --> 47:20.680
Sorry.

47:20.680 --> 47:21.680
I'm the Cobra.

47:21.680 --> 47:22.680
No, no, no.

47:22.680 --> 47:23.680
Go ahead.

47:23.680 --> 47:24.680
Go ahead.

47:24.680 --> 47:26.680
Is that, like, anyone who's doing anything that's hurting another person, blah, blah,

47:26.680 --> 47:33.720
blah, blah, like, it seems like there's a clean line there where it's like you're...

47:33.720 --> 47:40.000
The problem that I'm talking about is that what we do is we're, because that's a reprehensible

47:40.000 --> 47:45.280
concept, we, the internet has created this idea.

47:45.280 --> 47:53.240
It's like, come on, I've been on 4chan, like, you, like, there's, you can computer generate

47:53.240 --> 47:54.240
images now.

47:54.240 --> 48:03.800
So you can make a 8-foot blue woman with a giant cock, fucking a 3-foot Ewok, like,

48:03.800 --> 48:09.160
and the dick is like coming up out of her mouth because the blue woman's dick is fucking

48:09.160 --> 48:10.160
it so hard.

48:10.160 --> 48:13.240
So the blue woman's dick is over 3 feet long.

48:13.240 --> 48:14.240
Yeah.

48:14.240 --> 48:15.240
Someone's jerking off to this.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.240
Okay.

48:16.240 --> 48:17.240
Well, that's fine.

48:17.240 --> 48:18.240
Someone's jerking off.

48:18.240 --> 48:19.240
I'm fine with that.

48:19.240 --> 48:23.080
I'm also fine with, if you're attracted to kids, drawing a picture of a kid and masturbating

48:23.080 --> 48:24.080
to it.

48:24.080 --> 48:25.080
I'm fine with that.

48:25.080 --> 48:27.080
But when there's a victim, when there's a crime...

48:27.080 --> 48:28.080
Well, then there's nobody...

48:28.080 --> 48:29.080
Okay.

48:29.080 --> 48:30.080
Yeah.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.080
I want that on TMZ tomorrow.

48:31.080 --> 48:32.080
Kamehameha Nagyani.

48:32.080 --> 48:39.720
I'm going to have to report it last night and say I'm fine with jerking off to a picture

48:39.720 --> 48:40.720
of...

48:40.720 --> 48:41.720
Okay.

48:41.720 --> 48:42.720
So way out of context.

48:42.720 --> 48:43.720
No, it's not.

48:43.720 --> 48:44.720
That was in context.

48:44.720 --> 48:47.520
No, but I'm saying when there's a victim, everything changes.

48:47.520 --> 48:50.520
If the victim is a dog or a child, everything changes.

48:50.520 --> 48:51.520
But we're not talking...

48:51.520 --> 48:55.560
I was talking about perception, morality, pornography.

48:55.560 --> 48:58.120
Wait, you're standing up and have your hand up.

48:58.120 --> 49:00.440
No, I just wanted to change it.

49:00.440 --> 49:01.440
Come on up here.

49:01.440 --> 49:02.440
Show my mic.

49:02.440 --> 49:08.760
We're basically talking about is consent.

49:08.760 --> 49:09.760
If somebody says...

49:09.760 --> 49:17.200
Because in our country, particularly, each state even has this ability to say at what

49:17.200 --> 49:23.880
age you are allowed to say yes, and your mind has developed enough to say yes to activities.

49:23.880 --> 49:29.320
We demonize pedophilia because in our country...

49:29.320 --> 49:34.280
Because we're worried about people looking at stuff, the same way we worry about Dungeons

49:34.280 --> 49:37.320
and Dragons when I was 12, by the way.

49:37.320 --> 49:38.320
I'm increasing...

49:38.320 --> 49:39.320
Are you saying...

49:39.320 --> 49:42.640
I'm wading into the tarpets of being a pedophilia advocate.

49:42.640 --> 49:48.200
You really are, because are you suggesting that in 20 years, people are like, hey, those

49:48.200 --> 49:52.360
people were okay, but that's part of the problem.

49:52.360 --> 49:56.160
I want to be a reciprocist.

49:56.160 --> 50:02.440
I want to actually make the fucking headway of going, you know what, even though it's not...

50:02.440 --> 50:07.880
The easiest thing in the world for everyone collectively is to go, well, looking at a

50:07.880 --> 50:13.280
picture of this or reading a story about this, we can all agree that's disgusting, and the

50:13.280 --> 50:20.240
reason is because it's directly linked to behavior that is the definition of criminal.

50:20.240 --> 50:21.240
Sure.

50:21.240 --> 50:22.240
And immoral.

50:22.240 --> 50:23.240
Yes.

50:23.240 --> 50:27.800
And then we scale that one back, it's like we're in the surf, the internet is creating

50:27.800 --> 50:33.480
a surf between the unconscious and conscious minds.

50:33.480 --> 50:38.080
And it's like people are...

50:38.080 --> 50:40.200
What I propose, I don't know.

50:40.200 --> 50:47.640
I would propose that we propose less because we're being very, very clear as the internet

50:47.640 --> 50:48.640
is...

50:48.640 --> 50:52.480
And believe me, like 30 years from now...

50:52.480 --> 50:56.480
I'll be six feet in the ground, and I think I'm pretty sure...

50:56.480 --> 51:00.120
Give yourself 40 years or so.

51:00.120 --> 51:01.120
Maybe if I cut down...

51:01.120 --> 51:03.120
You wanted a doctor and your doctor...

51:03.120 --> 51:07.280
I'll be watching this from my porch on the rocking chair, but people are going to be

51:07.280 --> 51:12.320
flicking a switch, you know, on the back of their head or whatever the equivalent is,

51:12.320 --> 51:18.840
and you're going to be able to simulate you're an octopus and your neighbor's dog is coming

51:18.840 --> 51:20.440
over for tea.

51:20.440 --> 51:23.520
And you've got eight dicks to fuck it with.

51:23.520 --> 51:28.560
That's the thing, though, is that if you're doing it by yourself and there's nobody else

51:28.560 --> 51:33.720
involved, and it's a simulation, that's one thing, but as soon as you involve an unwilling

51:33.720 --> 51:38.280
participant and that's why children, it's so difficult because we consider it after

51:38.280 --> 51:43.280
younger than a certain age that they don't have the ability to comprehend the decision.

51:43.280 --> 51:45.720
I think it's a very easy line to draw.

51:45.720 --> 51:50.520
No, no, no, she's saying it's difficult to allow for freedom of expression, freedom of

51:50.520 --> 51:51.520
choice.

51:51.520 --> 51:52.520
When it comes to that.

51:52.520 --> 51:53.520
On that surf.

51:53.520 --> 51:54.520
Because the action...

51:54.520 --> 51:58.960
Right, because the action is suddenly inhibiting somebody else's freedom.

51:58.960 --> 52:00.720
And because the connection is between...

52:00.720 --> 52:08.440
You're dealing with people who are easily victimizable, like you're talking about a person who is...

52:08.440 --> 52:11.080
We're protecting this person for precisely the same reason.

52:11.080 --> 52:15.920
Before there was an internet, you could prey on a saber-toothed tiger, could eat them more

52:15.920 --> 52:16.920
readily.

52:16.920 --> 52:19.840
So you're talking about, like, okay, when I...

52:19.840 --> 52:21.560
Everyone say your favorite ice cream flavor.

52:21.560 --> 52:24.440
I love to go to fuckafouryearold.com.

52:24.440 --> 52:29.040
We can't just readily go, hey, have at it.

52:29.040 --> 52:33.000
That's a terrible ice cream flavor.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.840
We can't do that because we go, well, I cannot allow...

52:37.840 --> 52:42.360
Like Megan's Law was adopted because, like, there was a time...

52:42.360 --> 52:43.360
What is Megan's Law?

52:43.360 --> 52:44.360
Megan's Law is because...

52:44.360 --> 52:50.360
In California is because there was a girl, like, she was, I don't know, something horrible

52:50.360 --> 52:52.240
happened to her.

52:52.240 --> 52:58.320
And she basically lived across the street from a guy who was a sex offender who was registered,

52:58.320 --> 53:00.320
but the registration was not...

53:00.320 --> 53:01.320
Public.

53:01.320 --> 53:02.320
Yeah.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.320
Public.

53:03.320 --> 53:08.320
So now that's why they have to go door to door and be like, listen, I have this weird

53:08.320 --> 53:09.320
calendar.

53:09.320 --> 53:10.320
Right.

53:10.320 --> 53:15.520
I have the octopus in my neighbor's dog calendar.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.520
Yeah.

53:16.520 --> 53:17.520
Yeah.

53:17.520 --> 53:18.520
May is my fave.

53:18.520 --> 53:21.280
So stay away during that, Mike.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.280
And by the way...

53:22.280 --> 53:23.280
Picture really gets me going.

53:23.280 --> 53:25.960
Along with everything else, there's another surf you've created now.

53:25.960 --> 53:27.640
There's another beach.

53:27.640 --> 53:34.760
Because there are people who water skied by there, you know, they got a little drunk

53:34.760 --> 53:40.520
and they water skied naked past a family at a beach picnic, you know, and they're registered.

53:40.520 --> 53:41.520
Well, that's...

53:41.520 --> 53:42.520
Okay, but that's...

53:42.520 --> 53:43.520
Well, that's different.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.520
But what I'm saying...

53:44.520 --> 53:45.520
I'm not...

53:45.520 --> 53:46.520
If you're giving them the credit...

53:46.520 --> 53:47.520
But I'm not talking about creating policy.

53:47.520 --> 53:53.320
All I'm saying is, like, every time you scout out like these, like, every time we pretend

53:53.320 --> 53:57.120
that we know the difference between right and wrong, all we really create is more sand

53:57.120 --> 54:00.040
and more water, like another beach.

54:00.040 --> 54:02.000
I don't know the answers.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
Yeah.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
Well, I'm...

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Sorry.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Go ahead.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Sorry.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
Go ahead.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
Go ahead.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
What I think a lot of what you're talking about is the difference between fantasy and having

54:10.000 --> 54:11.760
fantasies and acting on them.

54:11.760 --> 54:14.520
And I know, like, yeah, like, for myself...

54:14.520 --> 54:15.520
You don't need...

54:15.520 --> 54:16.520
I mean, no one needs to applaud anything.

54:16.520 --> 54:17.520
No.

54:17.520 --> 54:18.520
It's just a thing.

54:18.520 --> 54:21.880
This is the fucking hardest conversation I've ever had.

54:21.880 --> 54:22.880
This is great.

54:22.880 --> 54:23.880
Good.

54:23.880 --> 54:24.880
No, I know.

54:24.880 --> 54:25.880
I love it.

54:25.880 --> 54:26.880
I love it.

54:26.880 --> 54:27.880
Can I say one thing?

54:27.880 --> 54:32.640
I saw Breaking Bad tonight, and you guys all fucked up, probably, though.

54:32.640 --> 54:33.640
It's great.

54:33.640 --> 54:34.640
Go ahead.

54:34.640 --> 54:40.240
When a lot of people know about the Kinsey Scale, obviously, but there's also...

54:40.240 --> 54:43.840
I forget what it's called, but there's also another scale of sexuality.

54:43.840 --> 54:44.840
The Kinsey Scale?

54:44.840 --> 54:45.840
Thank you very much.

54:45.840 --> 54:46.840
Good night.

54:46.840 --> 54:47.840
Thank you.

54:47.840 --> 54:48.840
Professional comedian.

54:48.840 --> 54:49.840
Thank you very much.

54:49.840 --> 54:50.840
He'll be here all week.

54:50.840 --> 54:56.840
But it takes into account, there's like seven or eight, or 16, there's a whole bunch of categories,

54:56.840 --> 55:04.120
but one of the main ones is fantasy, and you're allowed to have fantasies that you don't actually

55:04.120 --> 55:12.360
want to act on, and I think that's where a lot of not only homophobia, but discrimination

55:12.360 --> 55:16.520
about sex comes from is the shame from having a fantasy.

55:16.520 --> 55:21.800
And if I can get really real right now, and open up a little bit, but I personally, like

55:21.800 --> 55:29.280
I'm like a queer feminist, but I am like really, like I look at like hardcore, like violent

55:29.280 --> 55:34.320
porn on the internet, and like it's not something that I would ever want to do myself.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.320
Violent how?

55:35.320 --> 55:41.720
You know, like describe it real slow.

55:41.720 --> 55:43.960
While I jerk off behind the control of podium.

55:43.960 --> 55:45.960
Well, listen, but in that...

55:45.960 --> 55:49.000
This is why, by the way, that's why I have the podium, you guys.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.880
And I can get almost always got my dick in my hand up there.

55:53.880 --> 55:56.720
And it's also wearing a suit, go ahead.

55:56.720 --> 56:04.560
No, I mean, just, you know, like S&M stuff that I don't have any interest in, but that

56:04.560 --> 56:05.560
is...

56:05.560 --> 56:07.560
You have some interest in, you don't have interest in...

56:07.560 --> 56:12.080
Interest in doing it physically with my body, but my brain obviously is stimulated.

56:12.080 --> 56:15.080
Well, there's a huge factor there too.

56:15.080 --> 56:16.880
We walk around with clothes on.

56:16.880 --> 56:26.000
We, like I said, we have to, like 90% of our conscious lives, like we are in disguise.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.120
We are...

56:28.120 --> 56:33.880
Our sexuality is, and we're happy about it, otherwise it wouldn't exist.

56:33.880 --> 56:34.880
Oh, sure.

56:34.880 --> 56:38.760
We've certainly, we've revolted for less.

56:38.760 --> 56:45.040
If the plebeians didn't want cardigans and underwear and shoes and things, like they

56:45.040 --> 56:46.040
wouldn't exist.

56:46.040 --> 56:52.400
We're all pretty stoked about a certain fundamental wall between who we are as animals with our

56:52.400 --> 56:57.920
engorged privates and who we are, like walking around between orgasms.

56:57.920 --> 57:00.520
Well, the hardest thing has been...

57:00.520 --> 57:07.000
But so because there's that fundamental wall, like there is that other factor where, you

57:07.000 --> 57:15.080
know, people like things that are wrong, like that is a huge turn on.

57:15.080 --> 57:18.680
It's like a battery, like there is what's right and there is what's wrong.

57:18.680 --> 57:22.600
Yeah, like talking in an alley is awesome because of that.

57:22.600 --> 57:23.600
Public sex.

57:23.600 --> 57:24.600
Yeah.

57:24.600 --> 57:25.600
You get on it.

57:25.600 --> 57:26.600
Yeah.

57:26.600 --> 57:29.560
The abuse in the bedroom between two consensual adults.

57:29.560 --> 57:33.600
Like, I mean, like you said that, you know, like people shitting on each other was wrong,

57:33.600 --> 57:34.600
but the thing is, is like...

57:34.600 --> 57:35.600
But he didn't.

57:35.600 --> 57:36.600
He didn't say it's wrong.

57:36.600 --> 57:37.600
He's saying we think it's weird.

57:37.600 --> 57:42.200
I'm still mad about the night that we started talking about pooping on each other and people

57:42.200 --> 57:43.360
were too quick to...

57:43.360 --> 57:44.360
I think it's great.

57:44.360 --> 57:45.360
But I mean...

57:45.360 --> 57:48.320
No, if it's your thing, poop on each other.

57:48.320 --> 57:50.480
And if you both agree to it, like what's...

57:50.480 --> 57:51.480
There's nothing wrong with that.

57:51.480 --> 57:52.480
Yeah.

57:52.480 --> 57:53.480
If you found someone who did that...

57:53.480 --> 57:54.480
I mean, I don't want to wash the sheets when you're done.

57:54.480 --> 57:56.480
Let's not poop on each other, everybody.

57:56.480 --> 57:57.480
No, no, no.

57:57.480 --> 57:58.480
But if you want to...

57:58.480 --> 57:59.480
No.

57:59.480 --> 58:04.800
I mean, like if you like poop, then fine, but let's seriously, fucking back to the drawing

58:04.800 --> 58:05.800
board.

58:05.800 --> 58:06.800
At least...

58:06.800 --> 58:07.800
No, come on.

58:07.800 --> 58:08.800
I mean, I'm sticking to this.

58:08.800 --> 58:09.800
That's terrible.

58:09.800 --> 58:10.800
Why would you say that?

58:10.800 --> 58:11.800
I'm saying because I don't like the smell of poopies.

58:11.800 --> 58:12.800
But you're not there.

58:12.800 --> 58:14.800
It's not for you.

58:14.800 --> 58:16.520
It's just you're trying to sell a couple in Santa Monica.

58:16.520 --> 58:20.040
But if someone's listening right now going, I was on the fence about pooping on people,

58:20.040 --> 58:22.360
then they're gonna push me on the poopy side.

58:22.360 --> 58:23.360
I'm not pushing you.

58:23.360 --> 58:27.800
If you was on the fence about pooping, poopy sex, they're not on the fence about poopy

58:27.800 --> 58:28.800
sex.

58:28.800 --> 58:29.800
Exactly.

58:29.800 --> 58:30.800
And they need to be pushed.

58:30.800 --> 58:32.320
Some people like you, Jeff.

58:32.320 --> 58:37.480
If you're listening to me out there tonight, if you're listening to me, if you're listening

58:37.480 --> 58:42.760
as a couple and both of you look at each other right now, because I said there's such

58:42.760 --> 58:46.600
a thing as being on the fence about poopy sex, Dan Harmon will come to your house and shit

58:46.600 --> 58:47.600
on you right now.

58:47.600 --> 58:48.600
That's the Dan Harmon character.

58:48.600 --> 58:53.600
Go into your bathroom right now and start involving poop in your sex and see what happens.

58:53.600 --> 58:56.640
Eat the fucking kale and have the night of your lives.

58:56.640 --> 58:59.640
I'm really sorry I brought it up.

58:59.640 --> 59:03.640
But I mean, what Lauren was saying is like, you know, with the wind and stuff like that.

59:03.640 --> 59:04.640
Are you Lauren?

59:04.640 --> 59:05.640
Hi.

59:05.640 --> 59:06.640
Nice to meet you.

59:06.640 --> 59:11.240
But I mean, like there, but like, you know, when she's talking about like fantasy and

59:11.240 --> 59:15.840
making it real, it's like, you know, it's, you know, some people have, you know, they

59:15.840 --> 59:16.840
have rape fantasies.

59:16.840 --> 59:18.920
They have fantasies of being raped.

59:18.920 --> 59:22.200
But the thing is, is that there's a difference between having a rape fantasy and having somebody

59:22.200 --> 59:25.560
that can enact that with you that says yes.

59:25.560 --> 59:26.560
Yeah.

59:26.560 --> 59:27.560
Yeah.

59:27.560 --> 59:28.560
And safe for consent.

59:28.560 --> 59:29.560
Yeah.

59:29.560 --> 59:33.200
It's all about safe, sane, consensual that everybody is on the same page and everybody

59:33.200 --> 59:34.720
knows what's going on.

59:34.720 --> 59:40.280
And, and, you know, you look at like, like Jeffrey Dahmer, like he got off on dead men.

59:40.280 --> 59:43.280
And you know, we drew the line because he was killing people.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.280
Yeah.

59:44.280 --> 59:46.080
Maybe just broken into a cemetery.

59:46.080 --> 59:47.080
You'd be like, all right.

59:47.080 --> 59:48.080
I kind of see your point.

59:48.080 --> 59:54.680
What he was trying to do was actually he was trying to reanimate like dead bodies at a

59:54.680 --> 59:57.520
certain point to the point where they were had slight function.

59:57.520 --> 59:58.520
Really?

59:58.520 --> 59:59.520
Yes.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.520
Yeah.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.040
No, not with this, but he was actually like drilling holes in their heads and doing all

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040
sorts of crazy shit.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.440
That's why he was doing that as a Milwaukeean who was living a couple doors down from that

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.440
going on.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.440
Yeah.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.440
Yeah.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.440
Wait.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.440
All the laws in the world didn't stop it from happening.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.400
It's like as soon as, as soon as it was, you know, he would actually like kidnap these

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.200
men and then murder them to have sex with them.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.200
That's the line.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.400
That's the line is because these men aren't signing up to be murdered like that's the

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.400
line.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400
That's the line.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400
We've defined it.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.400
We figured it out.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400
Thank you, Kelly.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400
Kelly, everyone.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400
Isn't that a show you're on?

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400
That's the line.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.400
Is it anyway?

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400
Oh yeah.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:45.640
There is no line, there is a beach, it is a surf, like, like we, that is the thing that

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.520
we have to get comfortable with.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:54.200
There's no, there's no, there's no, there's no wall you can build.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:59.400
I thought like, like what, what legislation would you have adopted to prevent Jeffrey

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.440
Dahmer from eating 17?

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.280
Don't kidnap people and murder them.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.640
Those laws have already been in existence.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.040
Yeah, but he's outside the law just because he was able to get through it doesn't mean

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.040
we fucked up.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:15.720
So we, we keep trying to make sure that there's this wall ideologically where anybody that

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.840
does anything that's reprehensible to us so, so socially exists outside the wall.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:27.320
We keep trying to make sure that our laws say that if you're doing something questionable,

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.760
you're on the other side of the wall.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.160
And I mean, that's, that's a ridiculous attempt.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.920
Then what do you propose?

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.760
Oh, shit.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.600
I propose we stop proposing.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.840
Well, that's not solving any problem.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.680
I didn't come here to solve any problem.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.680
You're just shitting on people.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.960
You're just shitting on them without them.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.200
I love shitting on people.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.200
It makes me come.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.200
I knew it.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.200
I knew it.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.800
I want permission to shit on everybody.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:59.800
No, I didn't, I didn't, see, that's the fucking God damn it, Spencer.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.240
I don't propose anything.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.800
That doesn't mean I can't say something.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.640
Like you are, the walls are there, kicking them as healthy, pushing them down as healthy,

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.640
punching holes in them as healthy.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.800
Well, depends on the walls that you're punching and kicking, the walls that imprison people

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800
for raping kids.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800
Yeah.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.800
The wall that's leaving out pedophiles is a good wall.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:21.800
Okay.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.800
Don't kick that shit.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.800
That's not the wall.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:24.800
Don't kick, don't kick those walls.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.800
But you know, there was a time where homosexuality, there was a wall between that.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.480
That was a good wall to kick down.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.480
Kick down that wall.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.520
Black people, white people, marrying, that's a good wall to kick down.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.600
Pedophilia, that's not a good wall to kick down.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600
All right.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.800
We've figured it out, then.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.120
Everybody here is existing comfortably within walls where we get to run everywhere we want

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120
to run.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.120
What?

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.280
Nobody feels inappropriately limited in any way.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.720
I think it goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning with humanism and maybe

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.240
we should just like pay more attention to each other and like.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.560
Maybe this wall building system, maybe this idea that walls are a thing, like maybe that's

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.560
the problem.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.560
Maybe, maybe.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.760
What about the murder wall?

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.520
I just, if you think it's such a bad idea, I'll kill you all right now.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.080
Are you, are you going to kill us?

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080
I'm saying, if.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.600
Are you going to kill me if I lower that wall?

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600
If.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.600
You're not going to kill us.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.600
There's no police here.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600
There's nothing to prevent you from killing me.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.600
Yeah, but he won't, but somebody else will.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.600
You know, no one will.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600
Yeah, they will.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600
No one will kill me.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600
Yeah, they won't.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.920
Anyone that wants to kill me, come up and kill me.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.920
No, that's the wall.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.680
Anyone come up and kill me.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.960
I give you permission to come kill me.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.960
There's no wall.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.040
There's no wall preventing you from killing me.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.040
There is.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.200
If you say come kill me and he comes kills you, that guy is fucked forever.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.840
You think that's why he's not killing me?

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.760
No, no, but there is someone that would kill you.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.080
That's why you're not killing me because you don't want to go to jail.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.360
No, no, but there is someone who's not killing you for that reason.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.360
It's not this guy.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.040
There's someone who's not fucking kids for that reason, like otherwise they would, and

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.040
it's not anyone here.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:01.640
We are building walls too closely to where we live to keep people that we think are out

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.640
there.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.640
What about the wall and Game of Thrones?

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.640
We need that one, right?

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.640
Yeah, get some crows.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.880
That one is absolutely necessary.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.880
We need that one.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880
No, actually, no.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.880
God damn it.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.880
No.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:12.880
See, I got you.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.080
The whole point of Game of Thrones is you find out that that wall shouldn't be there.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.080
No, it means the wall should be taller.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.080
The wildlings aren't helping everybody.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.680
Yeah, the taller wall.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.200
The wall keeps out the dead ice zombies, man.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.200
The ice zombies, yeah.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.680
The ice zombies are fucking kids, dudes.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.720
The ice zombies are...

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.640
Can we talk about the morality of having me come up on stage to eject someone else from

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.800
the stage?

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.800
That was just defense.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.800
That felt really...

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.800
I felt really used at that time.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.880
I felt violated.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.200
I felt that there's a line between...

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.080
We thought that he was being ejected from the stage and he went over and took your seat,

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.360
which I thought is a seat of honor.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.160
I think of that seat as being your throne over there.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.160
Yeah, that's not some...

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.000
I just felt used.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.520
I wouldn't sit in your seat because I would feel like I was usurping a throne.

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.520
I'd sit in your seat.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.400
I'll shit all over you, man.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.480
Let's all thank Lauren for coming up and saying...

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.480
Thank you, Lauren.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.400
Thank you, Lauren.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:20.080
I mean, look, somebody walks into the middle of a field and starts asking the question,

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.360
why do we hate pedophiles?

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:27.840
And 48 minutes later, we're yelling at each other.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:33.760
I'm saying, it's a great episode.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.440
I'm saying, I think that our whole...

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.880
We need to evolve as people beyond a certain point.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.760
That system of thinking, when someone challenges you, when someone comes up to you and says,

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.640
hey, are you...

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:55.560
You brought up the fact that black people who had this culture going on, all of a sudden,

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.840
this shit started rolling downhill.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.240
This system of walls was a big part of that.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.680
There was a huge Muslim rap movement going on before 9-11.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.680
Sure.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:11.880
It just went into the drawers really fast, like 9-11 happened, and then it was like,

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.880
zip, mums the word.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880
Sure.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:21.280
But I mean, I think for society to exist and to have people who are, who have bad brains

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.320
from ruining society, we have to have these walls.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.920
I mean, what are you saying that we just have no laws and we just walk around, do whatever

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.720
we want and hope that everyone makes the right decisions?

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:37.560
But we don't have any walls between us and the kinds of people that build walls.

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:38.560
We have a new entry.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.560
What's your name?

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:40.560
Hello, Laura.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:41.560
Grab the mic over there.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.560
Fuck it.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.560
Let's do it.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.560
This is the Lawrence seat.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.560
It's the Laura Lawrence seat, yeah.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.560
No, I was just going to talk about this.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.560
We were talking about pedophiles and undesirables, but we didn't really talk about better living

01:06:47.560 --> 01:07:01.080
through chemistry with chemical castration because it's like people agree that pedophiles

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.080
should be put in prison.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.080
And some of them beg to be castrated.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:08.920
Some of them do, or chemically castrate or castrate, do we believe in better living through

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.760
chemistry with taking these people and making them unable to do all of this?

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.360
We do it to our pets.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.800
My girlfriend started crying the other night because Harvey's coming up on his day.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:20.960
Yeah, it's tough.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.560
I've had a million pets castrated, Spade.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.640
Your pets, they're just like pedophiles.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.440
I mean, they are.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.440
That's where the word comes from.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.440
They are.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.080
In the sense that they are.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.840
If you read any book about pet care, it says like, in case you're feeling bad about neutering

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:42.400
your dog, it puts you at ease and says, you know what, like, I know that to human beings,

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:48.000
this is a very valuable asset, but to the animals that we've domesticated, it's a source

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.400
of frustration and, you know, it presents them with urges that they cannot say shit.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.720
And it causes them pain.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.640
There's a reason for them.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.640
It's better for them.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.160
If they were to speak, they would thank you.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.160
And I believe it kind of.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.880
But do you agree that that's a way to deal with pets?

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.440
Is that more humane to deal with pedophiles than just put them in jail?

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.760
Do we agree that as a society, as an adult in America, that if you have certain desirable

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.800
urges that we don't like, then we can just mangle your junk or we can like cut it out?

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.000
I don't know, but I do think it's weird that we have more, we consider it more sacred what

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.480
goes on up in this bowl of pudding at the top of your neck than we do with the, this

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.600
mess between your legs.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.320
If you, and I don't know what the research is scientifically.

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.720
Can we call it a chocolate mousse in our legs?

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.920
If you castrate a, if you castrate a pedophile, do they just, they just, you call your dick

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.120
your chocolate mousse?

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:44.120
Well, weirdly, this is so much TMI.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.120
My dick is maybe five shades darker than the rest of me.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.720
So I do call it my chocolate mousse.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.520
Where's that clapping coming from?

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.520
That's my wife clapping back there.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.120
No, it's not Dustin.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120
No, it's my wife.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.120
Oh, it's not Dustin.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120
She knows.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.120
Dustin doesn't know.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.120
I don't know.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.680
But a lot of states in the south, during the fifties and sixties, they find records

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:13.920
that they sterilize people, that they thought, you know, we're poor, people go to prison

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.920
and they get sterilized.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:15.920
Well, that's bad.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.920
There's been movements about that too.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.200
If you're, if you're poor and you're having a kid, like, oh, this is just going to be

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.200
a welfare baby.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.120
There's been, there's been, there's been Joan of Arc's in that movement who have been

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.120
alternatively celebrated.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:30.720
I predict there's going to be no Joan of Arc in the pedophilia movement.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.680
I don't think there's going to be someone who are like, oh, it turns out they were

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.680
right.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.680
Okay.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.680
So let's move forward from that.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.600
So let's say, let's castrate them.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:45.400
So when you are, I'm not saying that that for me is a weird line, but you want to solve

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:46.400
a problem.

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400
Don't you?

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.400
Yeah.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.400
Put them away.

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:50.400
Or put them away.

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.400
How is that better?

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.400
Is it better to have them getting hard and jail thinking about kids or to just be out in

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.040
the world not thinking about kids?

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.680
Well, if they want it, but for me, it's me, something doing, doing something to their

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:05.880
body specifically, uh, against their will, they're putting their body in a cell against

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.880
their will.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.880
Yeah.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880
Cause they're fucking kids, dude.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880
Yeah.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880
For me, that's, that's the problem.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.960
Uh, you know what the rules are, how long are you going to put them away for the criminal

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.760
justice that we, we, uh, that we punish people, but we don't give any money or any, any energy

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.760
to actual rehabilitation.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.760
Like, yeah.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:24.120
Why not kill them, why not give you the gun, let you, let you put a bullet in the back

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.120
of your head.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.720
We throw people and lock them up for all these different crimes for drug possession and for,

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.680
for, uh, for rape and for all these disparate crimes and stuff like that, but we don't,

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.240
we don't have the time or the, or the will because again, like it's, it's not the reciprocity

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.240
thing.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.480
There's no, there's no profit in making a bad person into a good person.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:42.280
And the thing is, uh, in a lot of cases, there's no profit in the reasons to do it.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.280
There is no profit in the reasons to do it.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.280
Well, there is.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.120
In some cases, in some cases you're going to deal and I think that's, I think in minimal

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.960
cases you're going to deal with people that are unfixable because of the, the, the, the,

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:56.800
the glob of toothpaste inside their cranium, uh, there's just, just, just wiring that goes

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.320
wrong and it's bad things that happen to the human brain and it's complex as shit.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:05.560
Um, we should deal with every problem, the pothole on the street in front of our house

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.760
to, to, to, uh, to somebody being sick and having a runny nose to everything.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.680
We should deal with it as communities with compassion as opposed to throwing it away

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:20.040
to these, like just giving it to, uh, to, uh, the government and to things and say,

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:24.320
draw lines, draw big, hard lines in the sand and so we can just push things over these

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.160
walls and, and forget about them.

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.000
Uh, the hardest thing in the world to do was, it would be to actually care for each other,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.640
to actually be responsible for ourselves, for our parents, for our kids and not just

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.160
throw them into the street and, and, and like, you know, we, we, we don't have any responsibility

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.160
for our lives.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.080
And if your neighbor is a pedophile, you should be going down to their house and actually

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.440
you should castrate them.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.640
You should be the one to castrate them.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:47.640
One on one.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.240
Bring, bring up a nice pie.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.240
It's like filling a pothole.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:58.400
With broken dicks, uh, we should fill potholes with broken dicks.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:03.080
I'm not saying that we should go cut their penises off, but I am saying we should separate

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.480
them from situations where they can fuck children.

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.080
I feel like that's a very same thing for me.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:14.720
I am saying, I'm saying if the, if, if the proposal is that there be proposals, if the

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:21.360
idea is that there needs to be solutions, then the problem is that there is, I don't,

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:26.720
I don't think that putting someone in a, in a four foot cell, uh, because it stops them

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.040
from fucking children.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.400
They don't stay in there though.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.560
No, but when they come, do you want to keep someone in there until they die and then just

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:40.160
kill them or acknowledge that you are determining that sex, their sexuality is, and castrate

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160
them.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.160
A lot of them.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.320
Community is, community is like, if they ask for it, great, what do you want?

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:49.760
So we wait for them to ask for it and until they do, we put them in a cell and we wait,

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:55.200
we keep asking them, we hold up a picture of a child and we go, do you have a boner?

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.520
And if they say yes, then we leave them in there.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.600
Or if they say, if you have a picture of a, uh, if you have a boner promise you won't

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.160
do anything when you get out and if you can believe that, then let them out.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:12.560
But if, if there's someone, I, this is, if, if someone you think is going to rape children

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.600
when you put them out there, walls are a very good thing to have, putting them away from

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.800
situations where they will go fuck children.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.400
I just don't know if the walls are built.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.560
I mean, I, I think walls are fantastic.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:28.280
I, I, I have four of them of my own cheap out people that I don't like, but a lot of

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.960
those people are people that build walls.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.520
You're never going to build a wall that keeps murder from happening or keeps rape from happening.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.360
But we can keep trying, right?

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:40.000
Isn't it, isn't it the point to not have murders or rapes happen, that's what we're trying

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
to do.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.600
I think though that like there's, there's a way to deal with like problems like this

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:50.920
with criminality and, and, and with, uh, antisocial behavior is to look at the actual, like look

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.960
at the humanity behind what's going on.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.960
Sure.

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:57.960
Just cause I understand, just cause I see that a pedophile wants to fuck kids doesn't

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.400
mean he's any less of a criminal.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.320
I think it should be dealt with within, I mean, I think everything should be dealt with

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.880
within the actual communities themselves.

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:11.240
There was a story of a rapist that got paroled and let out and that the community took it

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.240
upon themselves.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.480
This is before the laws that you had to go and form the town.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:20.040
They said, if they put pictures of this guy everywhere and they said, if you see him,

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.600
do not lend him any services or any goods or anything.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.600
Yeah, but that's one.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.800
And the guy basically was just outcast and he actually came back and like, I'm sorry,

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.160
I, I, I can't survive like this.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160
Yeah.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.400
But that's one society in Pakistan where I'm from, all these villages have their own

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.400
rules.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.040
And if a woman marries the wrong person, they're like, all right, let's just kill this guy.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.040
In practice, those things don't work.

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.960
They just kill people.

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:47.360
Like you have to have these sort of rules that we've all agreed on, right?

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:50.920
Like that one situation that works, but it doesn't work in Pakistan.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.320
I think societies go through enlightenment and they go through dark ages.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.640
And I don't know if we're heading towards one or the other right now, but there's times

01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.480
when like, I think we go through thresholds of enlightenment where people actually like

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.320
step up and go, okay, compassion is the new rule now.

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.520
Then we head towards really dark ages and things like that.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.520
Yeah.

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.080
I mean, are we going to like, let's call a spade a spade.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:18.960
Are we are, is, is America, despite our self deprecation, self loathing, our, our, this

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.880
acknowledgement of the fact that we're on the economic downslide and that the empire

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.240
has fallen, are we top of the line or not?

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.360
Is it our responsibility to be the most socially progressive or not?

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.360
Okay.

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.840
Well, then let's, let's let it all back down into what works.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.920
No, it is, but we aren't.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.400
We aren't the most socially progressive.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.400
Okay.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.400
Yeah.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.400
It's great.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.400
It's very fashionable to say that.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400
But are we really aren't?

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.400
Okay.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.400
We really are not.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.240
Then let's not, then let's not make it our business to be so let's, let's, let's pull

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.480
back into what's functional.

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.480
What?

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.480
That's what America does best.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.480
What?

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.480
Let's be isolationist.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.480
What?

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.200
Are you, that's like saying, I'm not the skinniest guy.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.760
So I've never going to go on a diet.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.760
Like that's crazy.

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.320
Sweden's like super progressive, but that doesn't mean we can't try to like have better

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.320
wifi.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320
That's right.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.120
But if you, if you're spending money on a gym membership that you never use, can you

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:13.120
instead say, I'll cancel that gym membership and I'll just try to eat more fruits and vegetables.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:18.400
I don't subscribe to that example, but I'll do something.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.760
You look at the more economically advantageous route that you don't just keep throwing money

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.560
at a thing that clearly is not working.

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.240
For us, we could say economically to keep putting money into therapy for pedophiles

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.240
that doesn't work.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.840
It doesn't keep anyone from fucking kids.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:35.080
We could instead say, let's try to get kids off drugs or whatever and say, like, that's

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.080
not working.

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.440
Let's just castrate them all or put them all in prison.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.120
And what does Sweden do with their pedophiles?

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.240
Do they give them free wifi?

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.720
And what does, what does Sweden do?

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.920
What does Sweden do with non-Swedish people?

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.920
You know, there's Europe.

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.080
Do they do anything with them?

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.200
There's European prisons that are like actually designed for rehabilitation and they give people

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.200
a lot of freedom.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.640
They, like, put them on an island and say, oh, here you could grow your own food.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.640
Here's a little farm.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.520
That's what, yeah, that's what I want.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:07.760
Our prison system needs to be an island where capitalism is an option, but not required.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.160
Australia.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:19.120
We need to, we need to, the big problem with prison is that the big joke is like, you're

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.120
not, that's just punishment.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.160
Well, the joke is the profit because in America, you make money by having prison.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.160
Yeah.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.440
Like you have prisoners and you get, Pete, the government gives you the person money.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.440
Yeah.

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.440
You have this free labor force and it's insane.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.440
And you're like incentivized.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.440
No one's getting rehabilitated.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.440
You're only getting to be a better criminal now.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.640
I'm for rehab prison.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.640
I'm totally for that.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640
I think, you know, I'm not saying that.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.640
But nobody else is.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:39.640
Okay.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.640
So let's rehab a pedophile.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.640
What?

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640
In prison.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.640
Can you?

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.640
If you can.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.640
No, you can't.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.640
You can rehab self pedophiles.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.640
What do you, what do you want us to do with them?

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.640
We're not proposing things that have anything to do with the system we have.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.640
You just want a whole lot of progress.

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:56.640
By the way, the reason why I brought this subject up is not because I love pedophilia.

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.040
No, I understand.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.320
I understand that.

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:04.180
It's because I think that our system is like, like there, you can go to the dark corners

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:09.480
and realize that we are not equipped for the fucking hellfire that's to come.

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.640
Like we are, we are every fucking day.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:17.280
We are moving further and further into this surf where the walls aren't going to work

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.280
anymore.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.280
They're not going to work.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:23.800
The, the Canadians are able to argue that my show is a bad show.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.000
They don't, they don't matter on the Nielsen's.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.240
That's the first sign of the apocalypse that I have to talk to a Canadian on Reddit and

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:36.960
go, well, if you think about it, maybe community was funny last night.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.360
It's only going to get worse.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.760
It's only going to get worse.

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.480
I can't tell sometimes, Dan, I'm not trying to be provocative.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.440
I can't tell like right now, like honestly, like whether you're on the side of walls or

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.440
not.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.440
Like-

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.440
He's, he's against walls.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.280
I know that you're against walls, but you, you do live within a certain sort of-

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.440
I'm on the side of an audit into the masonry division.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:03.880
I would like to know what goes into the construction of walls and who's walling in the wall makers.

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.400
We necessitate walls because we don't want any personal responsibility for anything we

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.400
do.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.900
We, we give it to other people to build walls around our cities, around our ideas.

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.560
You don't want some of these people out there deciding their own morality.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.440
You don't want these people out there deciding what's right or wrong, right?

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:22.280
You don't want like a crazy person being like, in my head, it makes sense to fuck kids and

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.640
then kill this guy.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.760
It doesn't make sense for that to be, you have to have these walls.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.760
I agree.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:33.480
I would like to know for instance why I can't have this conversation without all of us trying

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:37.720
to build walls around each other and figure out where the right and wrong place to put

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.720
bricks is.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:44.400
I would like to know why this conversation can't happen without everyone starting to

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.000
assert the right and wrong of it.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.280
You and I both agree because we talk about this a lot, that the ideal society would be

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:57.120
one where there was a fluid conversation between communities and between people and no hierarchy

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:02.480
just based on an exchange of ideas and that would be women and men and queers and everybody

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:07.040
like doing cool shit and that would be great but the problem is the education isn't there.

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:11.480
You have to go through decades and generations of education to get people to have a fucking

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:16.160
– kids in a sand lot aren't racist, they're not fucking – they're not gross, they're

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:22.680
not – problems get dealt with really kind of quickly and very organically.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.720
For adults to do that now, you'd have to go through decades of education.

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.720
Well, that's why we're leaving for sure.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:30.440
You don't make seven billion people start doing something different.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.440
You can't now.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:35.320
The bummer, as I mean, oh, she's sleeping, Laura.

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.360
We've actually just traded more.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:40.280
Let me finish my thought.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:44.840
The idea now, the bummer, as I am going to turn 40 in a week – 30 in a week.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.840
Jesus.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.840
I'm trying.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:47.840
I'm trying.

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:48.840
That's hard living, man.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.960
I'm turning 40 in a week.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.120
You lose a little bit of your idealism and the sad thing is the idea that what I thought

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.560
was possible when I was 19 and reading all this stuff and thinking the idea that it's

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:05.640
possible to live communally, it's possible to have liberty and actually live for the

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:11.280
people around you, actually be the good version of socialists and the good version of libertarian

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.440
and be like a free society, you think, oh, it's happened.

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:19.800
We were close a few times throughout the last few hundred years.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:24.840
As you get older, which is a bummer, and I'm not trying to talk people into this, I hate

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.200
the fact that I don't think you can fucking do it anymore.

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.080
I don't think that we're – that we are involved in that.

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:34.040
Oh, no, I mean certainly the only one that's ever done this technology comes in as we allow

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:39.440
this technology and our funds and we sacrifice liberty so willfully because it's great.

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:43.840
It's so fucking awesome to just touch your phone and you have access to everything and

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.040
you don't have to learn or gain any knowledge.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.160
You don't have to go through anything to learn anything.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.380
You mean as you get closer to the dirt.

01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:56.040
You mean as you get closer to the grave than you are from the vagina.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:00.320
That's why 20-year-olds are co-opted into these educational labyrinths and into the

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.320
military.

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:06.640
That's why they are told to direct their passion, which is inherent to them, into

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.520
fighting for the tribe instead of fighting against it.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.840
They threaten us.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.920
We use them to kill each other when we go to war.

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.800
We use them.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.680
We fear them.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:25.200
We give birth to them and when they are teenagers, a 17-year-old person is so filled with so

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.000
much energy and so unafraid of death because they don't realize it's an inevitability that

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.760
they actually have a capacity for idealism.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:36.280
They have the capacity for change and we use them to build walls.

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:40.160
We use them to move cargo containers and we tell them, go off.

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:43.120
Hey, Iraq, you should go fight them.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.880
We tell them that they're full of shit and we live in fear of them as we creep into the

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.880
grave.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:49.880
I absolutely agree with you.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:54.200
At 40-years-old, I'm so glad I have toilet paper that's three-ply instead of two-ply.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.440
I can't believe I ever lived through two-ply.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.800
I can't believe I ever had to change my own light bulb.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.120
I can't believe I didn't know what dark chocolate was and how much better it was than milk chocolate.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.800
I can't believe breaking bad was so good this season.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:09.720
I'm so happy that I'm not going to get hurt before I die.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:14.280
I hope to God they stick a tube down my throat and they just take me out.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.640
But revolution doesn't come in a voting booth.

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:22.480
It doesn't happen within the worlds that we create for these kids.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.240
We build walls around them and we tell them the difference between left and right.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.480
We tell them that if your belly button is pierced, you're liberal and we tell them that

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:35.560
if you have a flag in your window, you're conservative and it's all horseshit because

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:41.440
there's worlds beyond those fucking walls and yes, if you break down those walls, you

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:46.520
might end up knowing a pedophile and actually forgiving them that maybe that was my point

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:51.680
the whole time, that we build these fucking walls that are so convenient for us because

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:56.640
there's people standing on them that say, if you go beyond this point, you forgive the

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.520
idea of fucking a three-year-old.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.360
There's other things back there.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.960
There's hidden packages.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.120
There's bonus levels.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:09.400
There's shit outside the rectangle that we create around ourselves.

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.640
We employ these people like you said.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.040
We wake up in the morning and we go like, oh man, I hope the cop keeps me safe.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.000
I don't want a dude crawling in my window.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.320
I got a girlfriend in here.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.720
I got a breaking bad party tonight.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:23.880
I don't want some dudes coming in and deciding to break bad.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:27.560
And those cops out there are going like, man, I'll protect that house.

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.560
Fuck an A, man.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.920
I don't want some dude crawling in there.

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.920
I got my salary.

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.920
I want to make lieutenant.

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.960
I want to do whatever the hell that motivates them.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.960
I only learned about police from Breaking Bad.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:43.840
It all goes down, but it's working.

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.440
It's working fantastic.

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:46.440
It's working great.

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.840
It works so well.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.680
Life is so safe and so easy.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:56.240
Even if you have it kind of bad, even if you're having, you're broke and you're indigent

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:00.240
and you have no direction, life is so comfortable and so safe.

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.200
It's like in certain countries, not in all of us.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.200
Just here.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.200
Yeah, just here.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.200
Or like 10 countries.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.200
But in our world.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.960
But then you watch, like every time I fucking turn the television on, there's some guy that's

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.640
shot up a fucking supermarket or a school.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.000
Or like a school of sleeping children.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Right.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
That happened today.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
There's a wall.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
That happened today.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Where was it?

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Nigeria.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.960
And there's a wall that says you shouldn't do that.

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.960
And that's a good wall.

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.960
That's a good wall.

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.960
Absolutely.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.800
But now life is so simple.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:37.160
I think people have always had neuroses and people have always been freaky and sad.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.320
Now there's more of us, first of all.

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.000
Second of all, we know everything that happens because there's cameras everywhere, so we see

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
it all happen.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
We can all watch it happen.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.280
We're also interconnected with each other that we're all more aware of it.

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.160
Now people talk about things more, rape is more talked about because people come forward

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.160
more about it now.

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.480
It's always been happening, but now it's a lot.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:58.720
NFL players have always been doing drugs and always been assholes.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.280
Now they're always on TV more because we care about it more.

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.920
That's our big fucking fetish now.

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:07.240
Life is so fucking easy that revolution now is people going, I don't like my life.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.880
I'm going to go out on TV.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.760
I'm going to go out with my name on the fucking CNN for 38 hours of a guy that did this fucking

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.520
horrible atrocity.

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.520
We can't build walls.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.360
There's no such thing as a wall that will keep that out.

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:25.640
There never has been a wall that keeps that guy out, but that doesn't mean we don't build

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:26.640
it.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.240
I think the wall is a bad metaphor.

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:29.240
There's no physical thing or separate.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.240
The wall is a bad metaphor.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.160
It's like there isn't a wall.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.920
There's simple rights and wrongs and we all have to agree on them and disagree on them

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:37.040
all the time.

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.440
And I think we do agree on them.

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.640
I think the first thing you have to do is address the fact that, like you say, there

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:46.480
is a mysterious, I've talked to a great, I think we all agree the wall is a bad metaphor.

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:51.160
Because there's no such thing as a physical wall that has ever kept any of the shit from

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:52.160
happening.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.160
And there never will be.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.160
There never will be.

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.840
But I think we think in our heads that if we build enough walls in the right places

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.640
that it will stop happening, the wall is a bad metaphor.

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:05.640
There is no such thing as a wall that will stop any of it from happening.

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:09.320
No wall stopped Jeffrey Dahmer from scooping a dead squirrel out from his crawl space and

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.320
going, run.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.320
That's interesting.

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:15.000
I think I'll make 17 people be my human zombies.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.880
There was no wall that kept him from doing that.

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.640
Yeah, but that doesn't mean he's wrong.

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.520
The wall is a bad paradigm.

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.520
Okay.

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.040
The wall is the difference between right and wrong, right?

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.600
It's the difference between right and wrong.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.600
That's what we're talking about.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.600
Boundaries.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.600
We're not talking about the wall.

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:31.600
The boundary.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.600
It's right and wrong.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:37.160
By the way, who's changing your light bulbs for you?

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:40.720
I wish Erin was here right now because she just literally got electrocuted yesterday.

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:41.720
Let's bring her up.

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.720
Oh, she's not here.

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:43.720
She's not here.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:44.720
Oh, shit.

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.720
Who wants to do your light bulb for you?

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.080
The short answer is yes.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.000
The medium answer is she got electrocuted doing it.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.120
The long answer is, I mean, okay.

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.560
Is she all right?

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:56.560
She's fine.

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.200
There was a, she was changing a light bulb.

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.200
Yeah.

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.200
It zaps through her.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.200
Well, since we bring her up, it's 9.37.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.200
Let's move on to D&D.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:12.520
No, no, no, we're not going to know what it is.

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.280
I said at the top of this, we were not going to settle anything.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.120
I only wanted to discuss Jesus Christ.

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.120
Hey, hey, we're starting D&D.

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:21.120
Yeah.

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.120
Wait a minute.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.120
I'm trying to find out by Lawrence.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.120
Hey, there's a wall right here.

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.120
I think Adam's proven there's no walls in this show.

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.440
Okay, let's play D&D.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.520
Dan, I will leave it to you to decide who plays Mulrainee.

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.520
All right, let Adam play Mulrainee.

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.520
Can we get a woman up?

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.520
Emily?

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.520
Do you want to play?

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.520
Okay.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.520
Sorry, Adam.

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.520
Oh, that's good.

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.520
I love you dearly.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.520
Emily's a therapist.

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.520
She's good.

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.520
Hey.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.520
This is a good Aaron replacement.

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.520
Hello, Emily.

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.520
Hi.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.520
How's it going, you guys?

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.520
Very well.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.520
I spent many years working with the kinds of people you're talking about.

01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:02.520
Yeah, actually, even if it clips as D&D, I want to hear Emily download about this.

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.520
We should have brought her up earlier.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.520
I would just say I spent many years working.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:10.020
I was a therapist for many years working with kids who were one step away from training

01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:12.020
at school, so they'd be gone forever.

01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:15.520
Kids who were sexual predators to other kids.

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.520
Most like...

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.520
I love you, Spencer.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.520
I'm so sorry.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.520
Can you talk about boundaries in this?

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.520
Yeah.

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.520
Okay.

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:23.520
You and I discuss this very often.

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.520
The need that you have to have when you're sitting across from a human being who has

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:33.020
tried to rape another child, who is 14 and tried to rape another child, you still have

01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:35.520
to have empathy for that kid.

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.920
The forgiveness isn't the right word, but empathy, which you said several times, that

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:40.920
is the right word.

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:44.960
You have to be able to not feel what they're going through and understand.

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:50.160
You have to be able to say, there's something going on with you that has you doing this,

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:52.960
and you're maybe never going to get them to stop wanting to fuck kids, but you can get

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:57.520
them like an alcoholic to learn to avoid situations, and that's all you work with them on.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:00.520
It's like these day-to-day skills of like, how do you avoid fucking a kid today?

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.360
I'm not saying you're not going to fuck a kid tomorrow.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.020
How do you get them to avoid doing it today?

01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:06.020
Right.

01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:07.020
And then it's just one day at a time, shit.

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.520
And you hope you're not stuck in traffic on the next day?

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:11.520
You tell them that.

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:14.520
Well, the idea is that they get it, yeah.

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.520
Okay, Thursday, there was a wreck on the highway, I fucked three kids.

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:21.520
It's a bad day for those kids.

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:29.520
But Emily, what do you think about imprisoning people who, I mean, if they offend physically?

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:33.920
I think we all agree that, well, prison is where we put people who have physically offended,

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.920
right?

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:37.920
And so it's like, what else are you going to do?

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.920
I'm trying to work on that part tremendously.

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:45.920
But it's also against the law, isn't it, to consume, to view, to think, to feel?

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:50.920
Well, but if you consume, then you're also supporting the act of someone child...

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:51.920
But those people go to prison, right?

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:52.920
Yeah.

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:53.920
So they've done nothing.

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.920
So there's a weird part of the wall there.

01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:00.920
They've supported the industry that they've made money to the people.

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:01.920
Okay.

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:02.920
Yeah.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:09.920
Okay, so if, for instance, I were to ever give perhaps 35% of my salary to something

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.920
that would ever hurt young children, like, I don't know, like a bombing raid on 20 countries

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.920
at the same time.

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:16.920
You know there's a line between that.

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:17.920
Maybe I should go to prison.

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.920
You understand that there's a difference between having to pay taxes.

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.920
The only line is the one that registers on her all, though.

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:22.920
That's the only line.

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:23.920
Here's the difference.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:24.920
That's the only line.

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:29.920
No, the difference is having to pay taxes versus knowingly giving money to something

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.920
that you know is going for a specific purpose.

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.920
Yeah, you're purchasing a service, a good or a service, and a good or a service.

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.920
You know the difference.

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:41.920
I know the difference, and so I get to keep plotting through my fucking life a little

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:45.920
and with me, you know, under a tombstone in a certain system.

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:50.920
But, like, the idea that there's not that much difference between that is, I think,

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.920
important enough to be stated.

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.920
It's important enough.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:57.920
What do you think if there is someone who has fucked one kid and you know...

01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:58.920
Just one?

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.920
Forget fucking one kid.

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.920
Fuck one kid fucking do your bid.

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:04.920
That's my motto.

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.920
What do you mean?

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:07.920
That's my new senator.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:08.920
That's your new motto?

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.920
Yeah, fuck one kid do your bid.

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:11.920
That's a terrible motto.

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.920
There's not a lot of stuff that rhymes with fuck one kid.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:14.920
You know what sucks?

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.920
It's a t-shirt.

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:18.920
Do your bid has to be on the back.

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:19.920
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:21.920
So it just says fuck one kid.

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:22.920
I walk around with it.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:23.920
I swore by it.

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:27.920
Yeah, listen, at Starbucks, it's fine if they're behind you.

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.920
You know, let's talk about the guy that, you know...

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:31.920
Yeah, who can't...

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:32.920
What do you think?

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:35.920
Yeah, the guy with the pictures on his laptop.

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:36.920
He's got a picture of a three-year-old kid.

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.920
Has he fucked one kid?

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:38.920
He's got a dick in his butt.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:39.920
Has he fucked one kid?

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:40.920
No.

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:41.920
How many kids is that?

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:42.920
No.

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:43.920
He's got zero kids.

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:44.920
He's got...

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.920
But it's a real control of a kid betting buck fuck somewhere and he has led to that kid getting

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.920
buck fucked by the fact that he supported that industry.

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.920
Yeah, that guy should definitely be in some kind of...

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:53.920
And then you gotta...

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:56.920
Oh, God, it's so complicated because you have to go with, does that guy want to stop?

01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.920
Does that guy think what he's doing is wrong?

01:32:58.920 --> 01:32:59.920
Does that guy want to stop?

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.920
Yeah.

01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:01.920
That's the thing that I...

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.920
Let's put him in prison next to a guy who had a pot plant in his flower box.

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:05.920
Yeah.

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.920
Before we decided that was legal.

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:08.920
You've talked to pedophiles.

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.920
Do they, in your experience...

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:11.920
You've talked to pedophiles?

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.920
Dated a few.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.920
Married the one.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:17.920
She traded up.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:18.920
She traded up, bro.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:19.920
I traded up.

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:21.920
Yeah, I don't fuck kids.

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:22.920
I don't know if you've gotten that one.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.920
Now you're getting that sweet chocolate mousse every night.

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:25.920
You know what?

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.920
I can't believe you keep telling people that.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:28.920
I'm sorry.

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:29.920
I don't know.

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:35.920
By the way, my bid for the title of this episode is Camel's Sweet Chocolate Mousse.

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.920
It's really my sweet chocolate mousse, I would say.

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.920
Do they know that the...

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.920
Do they know that what they're doing is wrong?

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:43.920
Yeah.

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.920
Absolutely.

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:45.920
They do.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.920
They know it's immoral that they shouldn't do it.

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:48.920
Everybody...

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:51.920
And I can't speak for everybody, but everybody I've ever talked to absolutely is like,

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:56.920
I wish I didn't like this so much, but I do, what do I do?

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.920
Yeah.

01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:58.920
See, didn't like it...

01:33:58.920 --> 01:33:59.920
Like, didn't like looking at it?

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.920
Didn't like...

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:01.920
They wish they didn't like it.

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:02.920
Yeah, but they do.

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:03.920
They hurt the kids.

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:04.920
Right.

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.920
Sometimes they do when they hurt the kids.

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:09.920
But when you have a kid who's 14 and has...

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.920
And he's acting out on 12-year-olds because he himself was raped by someone older, like,

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:15.920
how...

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:17.920
That's a tough call to blame that kid for what's happening.

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.920
Sure.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:19.920
They have...

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:20.920
D and T.

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.920
All right, yeah, what kind of monsters are we fighting on D and D?

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.920
I think that we're going to go from a conversation about walls into a dungeon, which is, if not...

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.920
It's defined by its walls.

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:32.920
Yeah.

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:33.920
Completely into that.

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:34.920
I was kind of...

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.920
World's worst segue!

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:37.920
Oh.

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.920
I can do a...

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:41.920
I can do...

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:45.920
Jeff, I can do a real quick palette cleanser story if you want.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:46.920
Do it.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:47.920
It'll be real quick.

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:48.920
It's about...

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:49.920
Okay, so...

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.920
It'll take, like, five minutes.

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:52.920
Five...

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.920
We're kind of...

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:54.920
We've got 15 to do this.

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:55.920
All right.

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.920
Okay, well, it'll be real quick.

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.920
Okay.

01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.920
All right.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.920
Okay, so I was...

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:00.920
When I was last...

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.920
At one point I talked about how, like, my relationship with my parents...

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.920
This seems like a long story, but it's not.

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:09.920
It's weird where they never, like, talk about, like, my comedy or career or anything.

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.920
So I texted them.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.920
I did a Comedy Central special, like, a couple months ago, and it was a big deal to me.

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:16.920
Thank you.

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:17.920
Thank you.

01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.920
I did my first hour, and I've been doing stand-up for 10 years.

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:21.920
It was, like, a big deal to me, you know?

01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:22.920
So I texted them, and I was like,

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:23.920
Hey, please watch it.

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.920
It means a lot to me.

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.920
So they watched it, and then I got a text from my dad, and it said,

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:32.920
Saw your special.

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:33.920
That's it.

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920
That was it.

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:35.920
That was the whole text.

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:36.920
No period at the end.

01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:37.920
No period at the end.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.920
Nothing.

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:39.920
Wow.

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:40.920
Yeah.

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.920
They put a period in your heart.

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.920
It's almost like my dad died during texting it.

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.920
Maybe there was a home invasion or something.

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.920
Yeah.

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:49.920
So I called them.

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:50.920
I was like, are you okay?

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:51.920
He's like, yeah, we're fine.

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:52.920
We saw your special.

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:53.920
That's it.

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.920
And it's thickened.

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:58.920
Story gets a couple weeks later.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:07.920
I'm on Amazon reading reviews of my special, and I see one from a certain Shabana Nanjiani.

01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:08.920
That's mom.

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:09.920
That's my mom.

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:10.920
That's my mother-in-law.

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:11.920
That's my mom.

01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:14.920
And you could tell from this that she doesn't know that her name is going to be on there.

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.920
She just logged in and reviewed it.

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:17.920
No, it's a good review.

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:18.920
It's a good review.

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.920
I hope she's just going to judge.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:21.920
She just flamed you up.

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:22.920
No.

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:23.920
Who is this cocksucker?

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.920
Back bitch.

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:27.920
That is the only way it would be better.

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:31.920
But this is like, the subject is no end to laughter.

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:32.920
That's the subject.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:33.920
Aw.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:34.920
Now we're talking about it.

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:35.920
That's the, yeah.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:36.920
It's already kind of ESL though.

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:37.920
You know what I mean?

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.920
It gets way more ESL.

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:41.920
The description is, here's the words.

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.920
I watched the DVD and could not stop laughing.

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:47.920
They were very well performed.

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:51.920
None of the jokes could be called stale.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.920
Not even one.

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:57.920
I have been watching other comedy stand-up shows, so now she's like, listen, I've been

01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.920
around a lot.

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.920
She's pretending like she's someone else.

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.920
I've seen a lot of stand-up comedy shows.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:10.920
Okay, now listen to how, this next part, listen to how it is almost a compliment.

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:11.920
Okay?

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:14.920
Pay attention to how this is almost a compliment.

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:21.920
I've been watching other stand-up comedy shows also, but this one is by far amongst

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.920
the top most.

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:26.920
Thank you for your qualifier.

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.920
Her mom gland, like, seized up as she almost...

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.920
Almost that.

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.920
Exactly, her mom gland seized up.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.920
All jokes were crisp and extremely well executed.

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.920
Very fresh, very crunchy.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.920
All I can say is...

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.920
He was adequate.

01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:47.920
He spoke English into a microphone.

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.920
All I can say is hats off to Beta Male.

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.920
Yay!

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:54.920
Good for her.

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.920
Wait, three stars.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.920
I'm joking, no, it's five, it's five stars.

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.920
If someone read it, they'd be like, it reads like a three-star review.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:09.920
Camille, the amongst thing with her trying to not just write a love letter.

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:11.920
She's trying, yeah.

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.920
I can't believe I'm defending her when my mom does the same thing.

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:18.920
So I was telling my friend about this, and my friend's like, you have to text her

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.920
and tell her you read it and that it meant a lot to you.

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.920
We have to break this barrier of you guys not talking about this big part of your life.

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:25.920
Turn on these walls.

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:27.920
So I texted your mom, exactly.

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.920
I don't know if that's the best metaphor, but...

01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:35.920
I texted my mom and I said, read your Amazon review.

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:38.920
Thank you so much, meant a lot to me that you enjoyed it.

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.920
It was amongst my favorite reviews.

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.920
Amongst the top most.

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.920
So I texted that, meant a lot to me that you enjoyed it.

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.920
No response for two days.

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.920
Here's the response.

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:51.920
Here's the response.

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.920
Two days later.

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.920
Saw Lee Daniels the butler.

01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.920
Pretty good.

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.920
They like movies.

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.920
They really like movies.

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.920
That was the response.

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.920
Am I Lee Daniels the butler?

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:05.920
Is that what she's talking about?

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:06.920
My dad.

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:08.920
My dad, I have a great relationship with my dad.

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:09.920
He's very straightforward.

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.920
He's very stoic and cool and groovy in old school.

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:14.920
I was on some new episodes of Whose Lies Is It Anyway.

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:15.920
It's improv.

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.920
It's not the funniest show in the world.

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:18.920
It's short form improv.

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.920
It's a great show.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.920
It's a fucking great show.

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.920
I don't put it up there with high art.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.920
We're doing make-a-mups.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.920
I told my dad it was airing.

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:32.920
He normally calls me right away.

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.920
He did not call me.

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.920
So a week later, I called him up.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.920
And we're talking about this and about that.

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:39.920
And he doesn't bring it up.

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:40.920
Which means I know what it means.

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:41.920
He doesn't like it.

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.920
And so I said, did you see the show?

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:43.920
He goes, yeah.

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:45.920
He goes, look, you were great on it.

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.920
But I told some friends from church to watch it.

01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:50.920
He was like, I wish I would have known

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.920
not to tell everybody to watch it.

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.920
But my dad said, I thought it was fine.

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.920
But he was like, the people I told to watch it,

01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:59.920
they're 80 and they go to church.

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:02.920
And Whose Line is one of the gayest television shows

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:03.920
in TV history?

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.920
I've made out with Colin Mockery more than most women I've dated.

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:11.920
And more than most women have made out with Colin Mockery.

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.920
Let's play a lightning round D&D.

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.920
Lightning round.

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.920
When we last met, our heroes were ascending the stairs

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.920
of a tall tower.

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:27.920
Each stair they climbed was one stair closer to Admiral Darkstar.

01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:30.920
Then the gang reached a warm door,

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:32.920
and after checking for warm traps,

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:34.920
they bounded into the room.

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.920
The chamber's high ceilings were covered in chains,

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:40.920
and three large stone lions stood watch

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:43.920
over a lone treasure chest in the room.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:46.920
Mulraine opened the chest with Christopherx acid help

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.920
and obtained arrows and craft supplies.

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.920
Then Sharpie climbed one of the lions

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.920
and began removing one of the statues' glinting eyes,

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:58.920
as the rest of the heroes also climbed the top lion statues,

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.920
for some reason.

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:03.920
Sharpie's prying was rewarded by an ominous rumbling

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.920
that shook the entire keep.

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.920
It was scary.

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.920
But what did it mean?

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:13.920
We'll find out now on an all-new episode of Harmontown.

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:15.920
Wow.

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.920
I wonder if we'll find out.

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:25.920
Seems like your mom is probably the person you learned to be funny from.

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:27.920
She's a little bummed out. What do you mean?

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.920
That's true. Your mom is funnier.

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:31.920
Sharpie, what are you talking about?

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:32.920
Nothing new!

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.920
Then I would say she's funnier than your dad.

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.920
She's like sneak attack funnier.

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:39.920
My parents are funny. They just have a weird thing with my...

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.920
My parents are getting divorced.

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.920
Oh.

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.920
So where am I right now?

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.920
Hey Spencer, we're trying to play D&D here.

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:51.920
I thought it might actually work.

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:53.920
Lightning round.

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:57.920
So you're on top of a statue, quark.

01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.920
Doing what? I wasn't here last week.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.920
You're just standing there to my knowledge.

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:04.920
Do you think you were the only reason why your parents were staying together?

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:05.920
Oh yeah, you know.

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:07.920
Now that you moved out...

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.920
I just thought if I brought it up, we'd play Dungeons & Dragons.

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.920
But really what it is, you moved out and now they're getting divorced?

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.920
Yeah, like a couple months later.

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.920
Is that right?

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:17.920
Yeah, well I told them I was the only thing holding their marriage together.

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:21.920
Kids usually, when I was 10, my parents separated.

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:24.920
Kids blame themselves for the separation.

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.920
That's the whole idea.

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:27.920
But I feel like it really is his fault.

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:28.920
He's right.

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.920
And I couldn't be happier.

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.920
You're happy they're getting divorced?

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.920
Well, I mean, I always wanted to make them get divorced.

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.920
And this counts, right?

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.920
Listen, no, he's right.

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:39.920
He knows his parents and if he thinks they're better off,

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:40.920
not with the...

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.920
No, no, I just want to tell him he's miserable.

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:48.920
I will say, if you're parents out there and you're staying together for the kids,

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:49.920
go fuck yourself.

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:53.920
On behalf of the kids of the world, separate.

01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:55.920
We're human beings.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:00.920
I have 7 billion exhibit A's.

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:05.920
And whether or not you staying together makes everything work.

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:06.920
Fuck you.

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.920
So like, split up, you fucking dicks.

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:09.920
So I'm on top of it.

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:11.920
Stop blaming me for your marriage.

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:12.920
I'm on a statue.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.920
Yeah.

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.920
Yeah, you guys are all on stone lion statues.

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:21.920
They're each about 15 feet tall and everything's rumbling.

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.920
It's all rumbly.

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:23.920
Like your parents' marriage?

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:29.920
Like, yeah, like the crumbling stones of the foundations of marriage.

01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:30.920
All the marriages.

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:32.920
Or the walls that are keeping the pedophiles out.

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:33.920
Yeah.

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.920
Same stone, same stone, argument can be made.

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:39.920
Build your walls, build your alliance.

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.920
It all falls down.

01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:42.920
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.920
Sanimal, sanimal.

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:48.920
I jump off of my statue and go toward the doorway, came in through.

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.920
Okay, you do that.

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.920
The rumbling doesn't diminish any.

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:54.920
In fact, it increases.

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.920
Do we know where the rumbling is coming from?

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:57.920
It's coming from everywhere.

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.920
It's like an earthquake.

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:02.920
Now, who plucked out the eyeballs?

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:06.920
He pulled out, or he was trying to pry out one of the eyeballs.

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.920
And you're giving it, giving a real, real workings, isn't it?

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:11.920
A real workings.

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:15.920
Yeah, real workings is the old gnome term for it.

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.920
Should we try and put the eyeballs back in?

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:18.920
It's not out yet.

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:19.920
Oh, it's not even out yet.

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.920
No shit.

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:23.920
So you trying to get the eyeball out is what made this rumble start happening?

01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:24.920
Perhaps.

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:25.920
Yeah.

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:27.920
Quit messing with those eyeballs.

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.920
I push it back in.

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.920
What about those chains that were dangling?

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:31.920
They're still dangling.

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:32.920
Do we climb them?

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:33.920
Do we know about those chains?

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:35.920
Yeah, I mean, you know they're on the ceiling.

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:37.920
You could climb them if you're on a statue,

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:39.920
but quark's not on a statue.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.920
The rest of you guys are.

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:41.920
Yeah, you just jumped down.

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.920
I get back on my statue.

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.920
It's not your turn, bro.

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:47.920
We're not in combat right now.

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:48.920
I can do whatever I want.

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:49.920
Get back up there.

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:50.920
Don't tell me what to do.

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:51.920
No, no, no.

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:52.920
If you like.

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:54.920
Don't build walls around me.

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.920
You can get up there.

01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.920
All right.

01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:57.920
I'm back on my statue.

01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:58.920
Yeah.

01:44:58.920 --> 01:44:59.920
Sounds good.

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:01.920
Does anyone else want to try anything?

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:03.920
I want to try to climb one of the chains

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:05.920
and see what happens.

01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:06.920
I like that.

01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:07.920
Oh, he's going for the dice.

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:08.920
Oh, he's getting on his dice.

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:11.920
He's like a real game in everything.

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:14.920
You climb atop the chains.

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.920
Now you're hanging from chains.

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:18.920
I passed that president's fitness test.

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.920
I could do this for a while.

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:21.920
Oh, yeah.

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.920
So you hear the rumbling.

01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:25.920
It was intensifying.

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:26.920
Now it stops completely.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.920
And as soon as it stops, you hear,

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.920
it sounds like a viscous fluid.

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:33.920
And out of the mouths of these lions,

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:35.920
pours hot, bubbling, glowing lava.

01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.920
See?

01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:39.920
And it begins filling up, filling up this floor here.

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.920
Oh, you guys better get on these chains.

01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.920
Now the floors, they're all, they're all lava-y.

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.920
Oh, but we're safe on top of our statues, right?

01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:46.920
Currently.

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:47.920
Currently.

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:48.920
Yeah.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.920
Yeah.

01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:50.920
All right.

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:51.920
Good move on my part to be on top of these things.

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:52.920
All right.

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:53.920
What do you see on top of that chain?

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:54.920
Is there anything up at the top of it?

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.920
So from your vantage point, like you can only see more chains.

01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:59.920
So it's almost like there's a huge canopy of chains

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:02.920
above your head that's blocking above,

01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.920
but you can only see blackness.

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:06.920
And you're just on one of these dangling ones.

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:07.920
So you'd have to climb up.

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:08.920
Does anybody have a light?

01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:09.920
Does anybody have a light?

01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:10.920
I don't know.

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.920
I can cast light.

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:13.920
I have low light vision.

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.920
Either one of those do things.

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:16.920
And I have a torch.

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:17.920
You want a torch?

01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:18.920
Yeah.

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:19.920
She's up there.

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.920
Well, you guys can climb up your chain.

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:21.920
Yeah, climb up your chain.

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:23.920
I jump to a chain and start climbing up a chain.

01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:24.920
My arms are so strong.

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:25.920
You don't.

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:26.920
I have a 12.

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:27.920
A 12 climb.

01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:29.920
A 12 climb.

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.920
Bonus modifier.

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:32.920
Yeah.

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:33.920
Well, what's your acrobatics?

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:36.920
I mean, you're, yeah, acrobatics.

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:38.920
It's jumping three, five.

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:39.920
I'm sorry.

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.920
11.

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:41.920
11.

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:42.920
Okay.

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.920
Well, see that counts and that you jump onto the chain

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:48.920
and you grab it with both hands.

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:49.920
All right.

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.920
It's a different chain than the one she's on.

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:52.920
Correct.

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.920
Yeah.

01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:54.920
I start climbing up it.

01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:55.920
All right.

01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:58.920
You do so with great gusto.

01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.920
Is everyone climbing chains?

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.920
Should I jump on a chain or?

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.920
You do what you want, man.

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.920
It seems pretty, pretty all right.

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:08.920
Seems like a good idea so far.

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:11.920
But can I, do I have anything that, so that she can see

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:12.920
because it's dark up there?

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:13.920
Is there anything I can do?

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:14.920
Do you have a torch?

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.920
Oh, you have the goggles of night.

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:17.920
Me do?

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.920
Yeah.

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:19.920
You do.

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:25.920
Me through goggles at night.

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.920
Me do some big workings.

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:29.920
Can I throw them to her?

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:30.920
Yeah.

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:31.920
Is there a chance she won't catch it?

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:32.920
Definitely.

01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:33.920
Yeah.

01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:34.920
All right.

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:36.920
I feel like his role playing is less cocksure

01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:40.920
because his wife is in the mix.

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:43.920
Well, I get on the chain.

01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.920
Honey, don't hurt yourself.

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:47.920
That this person unknown to me is on

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.920
and I climb all the way up and I go,

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.920
hey, honey, here's the goggles of night.

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:55.920
Leaping, leaping onto the chains

01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:56.920
who do as you described

01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:58.920
and you give her the goggles of night.

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:00.920
Okay, so I put the goggles on.

01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:01.920
I'm looking up.

01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:02.920
Oh, man.

01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.920
You see a large metal hatch in the ceiling

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.920
through all these chains.

01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:07.920
Yeah.

01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:09.920
I climb.

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:11.920
I climb to the hatch.

01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:13.920
But before you could climb to the hatch,

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.920
you hear a voice call out

01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:17.920
echoing through the chamber above.

01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:18.920
Oh, boy.

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:20.920
You've managed to live.

01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:23.920
You've managed to last.

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:29.920
But how can you handle this blast from your past?

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:31.920
And then it's Brandon Frazier.

01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:34.920
Woo!

01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:38.920
So on hearing that,

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.920
the hatch in the ceiling that only you can see

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:43.920
begins to open and you see

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.920
the large multi-legged form

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.920
coming out of this hole.

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:49.920
Tell us about it.

01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:50.920
I'm fucking freaking out, man.

01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:52.920
Oh, you're fucking freaking out.

01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:54.920
It looks like a cross

01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.920
between some sort of spider and humanoid.

01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:58.920
You see three of its legs are replaced

01:48:58.920 --> 01:48:59.920
with metal spikes.

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:00.920
Oh, no.

01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:02.920
It has several scars on its body

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:05.920
and it has a large hole in the back of its head.

01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.920
It's covered in metal placed.

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:09.920
Is this the one that I thought was when he was dead?

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:10.920
Yeah.

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:11.920
It's Preppy.

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:13.920
Preppy now.

01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.920
You hear a metallic voice ring out.

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.920
I'm Preppy.

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:20.920
Oh, Cliff Hanger!

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:26.920
Thank you, everybody, for coming to Harmontown

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:29.920
on an all pedophilia night.

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:31.920
Listen, don't build a wall

01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:34.920
between yourself and a pedophile tonight.

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:38.920
Find one pedophile and lower the wall.

01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:39.920
No, don't do that.

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.920
Let's thank Lauren, Adam, Kelly, was it?

01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:46.920
Laura, Emily Gordon, Kumail Nanjiani,

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.920
Spencer Crittenden, and I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.920
One more time for Dan Harmon, the mayor of Harmontown.

01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.920
We didn't really make it to the mood,

01:49:58.920 --> 01:49:59.920
but we got pretty close.

01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:00.920
I know what it is.

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:02.920
If it's easy to hate somebody,

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:04.920
maybe don't hate him.

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.920
If it's hard to hate somebody,

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.920
maybe hate him.

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.920
That's what I was trying to get through to.

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:12.920
Good night. See you at the drawing room.

01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:38.920
You just broke through the wall, my friend.
