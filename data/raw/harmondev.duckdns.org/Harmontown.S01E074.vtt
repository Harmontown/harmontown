BABY GOT THE POW!\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:18.000\nWelcome to Harmontown!\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:25.000\nFrom Meltdown Comics, Hollywood, California, Harmontown is once again in session.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:32.000\nPlease welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Jen Harmon!\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:45.000\nBOOM BOOM BOOM!\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:55.000\nBOOM BOOM!\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:58.000\nBOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:06.000\nAlright, that is my response to record low attendance.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:10.000\nA small but an alert crowd.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:21.000\nI have performed for four people once, and it was one of the greatest shows I've ever done.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:30.000\nWhen I was doing a professional improv in Milwaukee, one of my gigs was I was summoned to the living room\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:36.000\nof a woman who my agent told me, I had an agent, an improv agent.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:43.000\nShe told me in Monday Carter that we would be performing for, I'm sorry, I said for six people,\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:48.000\nbecause she said it's three couples, and the reason they're getting together,\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\nand they want to have a quiet evening at home, and the reason is because one of the wives\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:58.000\nand one of the three couples has just been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:03.000\nSo will you please go to their home and will you please do some improv for them in their living room?\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:06.000\nAnd can I get 10% of that action?\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:09.000\nAnd it was a great show, it was great.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:13.000\nThere's no stories to tell there, I'm just saying.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:19.000\nThis show is irregularly light because of one reason.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:23.000\nPossibly because of Breaking Bad Finale, maybe.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:24.000\nDefinitely.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:29.000\nOr maybe just because of slow entropy, maybe because, maybe it's for the same reason\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:34.000\nthat there's not as much gasoline when you pull oil out of the earth.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:40.000\nMaybe we've condensed, maybe these are the real harmonians.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:44.000\nYeah, I'd like to think that the people here tonight are the real Harmontown fans.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:45.000\nYeah.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:51.000\nThis is the night, this is the night where it all comes together.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:55.000\nOr it's people who have Monday off, or it's people who...\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:59.000\nYeah, this is the night where we actually go to the moon.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:04.000\nAnd the fucking other 60 people that didn't come are going to miss the boat.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:05.000\nThat's it.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:08.000\nWe're taking a moon boat.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:09.000\nMoon boat?\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:13.000\nWe're going to row through a Milky Wave stream of starlight.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:14.000\nFlavored dreams.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nWith a paddle of love.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:19.000\nNo, we're going to get deep, we're going to get intimate.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nWe're going to make it the best show ever.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:25.000\nAnd people who didn't come here tonight are going to, they don't deserve to be punished,\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nbut they should know that they never know.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nThey'll be old and they'll be on a rocking chair at a veranda somewhere,\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nand they'll think, I chose Breaking Bad over that Harmontown.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:40.000\nAnd I went there 70 times and didn't come to that one.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:43.000\nAnd that is why I failed.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:47.000\nThey'll be on the porch next to another person on a rocking chair and that person will go,\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:52.000\nthe premiere of Breaking Bad's finale was on iTunes two days before that night.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nAnd they'll go, really?\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nThey'll go, yep, sure as this lemonade's sweet.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nAre we really on a porch?\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:04.000\nNo, we're in an alien holographic four-dimensional storage unit.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:08.000\nOur species has long been enslaved by lizards.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:10.000\nIt won't matter.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:16.000\nBut we need not worry about crowd volume.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:22.000\nWe have to worry about morality.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:29.000\nWe have to worry about the pudding inside, in which lay the proof.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:37.000\nThe pudding inside your skulls, where this weird pudding network that we don't understand yet\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\ncreates the perceived difference between good and bad.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nI was just listening to a radio lab on the way here,\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:50.000\nwhich is where I get all of my information that doesn't have anything to do with me or community.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:54.000\nAnd they were telling this story about this guy.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:57.000\nI'm 20 minutes into it and I'm already riveted.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:01.000\nHe had seizures and so he had part of his brain removed.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:06.000\nThen he had another part of his brain removed and then all of a sudden the cop started his door\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:13.000\nbecause he's got kitty porn on his hard drive because his personality shifted and changed.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:17.000\nWhat was fascinating to me is whether or not his personality shifted and changed.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:21.000\nWhat's most fascinating to me is that I'm listening to a podcast that's produced by people\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nthat are saying, let's figure this out.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:26.000\nLet's figure out whether or not this person is a good or bad person\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:32.000\nor when he became a good or bad person or what defines good or bad behavior.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:40.000\nAre we living in a world where we all constantly can't wait to jump on the Internet\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:48.000\nand look at naked pictures of three-year-olds or are we living in a world where that is not the case\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nand therefore there needs to be an understanding.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nThat's something weird is going on in your head if that's going on.\n\n05:54.000 --> 06:03.000\nDo we regard every single thing that you do that is not compatible with the Borg cube\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:08.000\nas being a malady on your part?\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:13.000\nDo we then forgive you and having forgiven you, do we try to cure you?\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:18.000\nAll of these are rhetorical questions.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:19.000\nNone of them have answers.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:22.000\nThis is the root of what we're doing.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:23.000\nThis is what society is.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nAll of us have this pudding in our brain.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:29.000\nAll of us think at one time or another, oh, I'm going to go up to that guy.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:30.000\nI'm going to say good morning.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:31.000\nOkay, well, that's been approved.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:32.000\nThat's fine.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:33.000\nThat's on a ticker tape.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:37.000\nYou're going to be the 500 millionth person to say good morning to another person.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nYou have zero chance of going wrong there.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nThe other person says good morning back.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nZero chance again of going wrong there.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:47.000\nNow at some point, if you want to climb up the ladder,\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:50.000\nif you want to get closer to the papaya than the chimp above you,\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nyou have to start risking things.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nYou have to start doing things differently.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nYou have to start expressing yourself.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nGood morning.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:03.000\nToo cloudy though yesterday.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nThere's a risk there that the guy in front of you will go,\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:09.000\nwhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nEverything will go crazy.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nMen with kevlar vests will come in and grab you and say,\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:17.000\nwhy did you think it was too cloudy yesterday?\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nWhy did you think that?\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nYou need to go to prison.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.000\nYou need to go to a hospital disguised as a prison.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nYou need to go to a prison disguised as a hospital.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nYou need to be crucified.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nYou need to be apologetic.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nYou need to be fixed.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nWhat is our goal?\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nWhat is our end game?\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nWhat do we expect of each other?\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nWhen we see another human being on the street,\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\ndo we want them to be like us?\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:48.000\nOr do we want them to be different?\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nI think the answer is probably,\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:53.000\nGoldberg, will you fucking cool it with the package?\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nIt's a bag of Cheetos.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nI'm recording the value.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nIs that you, Adam Goldberg?\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\n99 cents for a bag of sunships that expenses the whole show.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nHe's crinkling and crinkling.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nThe whole time you're talking,\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.000\nthere's a sound of one person eating chips louder\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nthan chips need to be eaten.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nSo do we want to fix him?\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:17.000\nI think, and Adam, if you come on stage,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.000\nI'm going to put you at a full Nelson.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nHe was eating chips loud on purpose, right?\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nNo, no.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nI opened them after you said that.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nWillfully loud chip eating.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nWillfully loud chip eating.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:37.000\nBecause you're in the fourth row for the first time ever.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:40.000\nYou came here late and didn't get in the second row.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nSo you're eating chips at a fourth row level right now.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nYou yell at me, and it's worth it.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nKeep it fucking down, man.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nGood advice.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:54.000\nSo anyways, I've driven in here.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nI have to write something down you said.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nMuch the same as the riboflavin and salt\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:05.000\nin that bag of chips has made Adam uncontrollably...\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nGo on, I'm just starting a page with my thing.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nMy search for truth has made me...\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nYou don't have to put your hand that far in the bag\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nto get a chip out of it.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nThe bag is bigger than your wrist.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:22.000\nYou can delicately insert your hand into a bag of chips.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nNow I feel bad that I outed him.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nNo, it's too much.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nNo, not that loud, though. You haven't.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nYou haven't ever been that loud.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nBecause you would feel terrible if you saw other people\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nheard you eating the chip.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nHe wants you to know he ate the chip.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nYou think he wants you to know he ate the chip?\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nYes, he does.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nAdam Goldberg demands that you know that he has chips.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nAnd now we're talking about it,\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nand now he's ascending into heaven right now.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:55.000\nHe's sitting at the left hand of God.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\nAlright, well, I want to keep talking about\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nthe weird tapioca in our brains\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:03.000\nand what our end game is.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nWhat are we supposed to do?\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nI want to talk about morality.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nBecause there's something different...\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nNotice how quiet it is right now?\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nIt's fine, which is good.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nAre all the chips gone?\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nOh, I'm sorry. Yes, Jeff, you did great.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nAdam, are you done with your chips?\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nDo you want to pour them into a bowl?\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nNow he's nodding in silence.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:27.000\nWe've martyred him. He's behind the rock.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nHe's Joan of Arc.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:32.000\nWe'll roll it aside in three days and he'll take over.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:39.000\nI want to talk about...\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:43.000\nYou know, so often the big thing that it comes down to\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nis we've got these big giant brains\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nand we figure out the things we can do.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nYou can put a human ear on the back of a mouse.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nYou can wear glasses.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nNow you can read a book. There's a light bulb.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nNow, nighttime isn't nighttime anymore.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:58.000\nHonestly, science wins.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nIt's the better religion.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nParticularly because of the way it pursues its endeavors.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:06.000\nYou lock hands and you say, what don't we know?\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nLet's figure out how to know it.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:11.000\nLet's not trust any crackpot who happens to be charismatic.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nJust because he has weird hair and his tongue can hang out\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nand the posters and Spencer's gifts\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\ndoesn't mean that he's a better scientist.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nEverything is peer-reviewed.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nEverything is hypothesis and testing and proof.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:27.000\nAnd it's always up for debate, always up for act checking.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nAnd slowly but surely, like an amber alert,\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:33.000\nwe will close in on God and we will find him\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:36.000\nand we will grab him and hug him for a second\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nand then slap his face and go,\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\ndo you know how much you worried me?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nThat's science and that's the religion I approve of\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nwhen it comes to a relationship with the unknown.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:50.000\nHowever, what it lacks, what it constantly lacks,\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:54.000\nwhat it conveniently lacks is this thing\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nthat for lack of a better word\n\n11:56.000 --> 12:01.000\nand there is a sincere, severe lack of a better word, morality.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:05.000\nThat other thing, that feely thing,\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:09.000\nthe umbilical thing, the thing that connects you\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nto the unknown thing, the thing that makes you go,\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:20.000\nyeah, but neither of these things\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:23.000\ncan be given control over us.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nWe're so smart, we keep figuring out how to do stuff,\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nwe keep learning new things about why we are the way we are\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nand every time we do, we go, okay,\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:34.000\nthat means that nothing means anything anymore\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nand then the other people are always going,\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nyeah, but everything's always meant to everything\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nand that means that you shouldn't even be learning these things\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.000\nand they're all assholes, we're all fucking idiots.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:46.000\nSo we're not going to get to the bottom of it tonight\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.000\nbut before we go to the moon, we've got to get our shit straight.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:53.000\nWe've got to understand what constitutes,\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:56.000\nbecause I've said a million times before,\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\na dollar is a dollar, a dollar is worth 100 pennies\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:04.000\nand a penny is worth a penny and that is fine, capitalism works fine\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:09.000\nbut we have to say that the human life is worth more than all of that.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nIt has to be a separate tier, it cannot be,\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nthat's the flaw of capitalism, it's the flaw of humanity\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nto the extent that it embraces capitalism.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nSo the big question has to be before we get to the moon,\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nwe better know if somebody hits their head on a rock\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nand they start going, I used to like purple, now I like yellow,\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:29.000\nyeah, but commander, all the controls are set for purple\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nand yeah, but yellow's the best.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:36.000\nOh shit, we have to know what we define as human.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:40.000\nIs it efficacy? Is it utility?\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:45.000\nBeef steak bill, who's been reborn from beef fungus pills,\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nraising his hand slightly.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:51.000\nIt's our ability to choose.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:55.000\nYou better come up if you, this is heavy stuff.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nBeef steak bill.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:00.000\nIt's heavier than Breaking Bad, I think.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nSo far, yeah.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.000\nI mean, what's he going to do?\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nHe's going to use the machine gun in his trunk.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\nHe's going to use it on one of three characters that are left.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nYou've been playing GTA.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:13.000\nYeah, I have, but also listening to Radio Labs\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:16.000\nabout people having seizures that turn into pedophiles\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nbecause certain sections of their brain are cut.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nWhat were you saying about free will, Bill?\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:24.000\nOkay, I was watching a YouTube video from a Harvard professor\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:28.000\nwho said, who seemed to think that the thing that we value the most\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:33.000\nis our ability to choose and to take away somebody else's ability\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:37.000\nto choose is, by far, the biggest crime you could ever make.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nBecause our entire religion, no matter,\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nand I think this spans the entire globe,\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:46.000\nevery single origin myth has to do with humanity diverting from\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:52.000\na sort of, what would you call it, a nothingness\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:57.000\nby virtue of our desire to choose or our curse to choose.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:01.000\nAnd at that point, God, I mean, the easiest example is Genesis.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nGod says, you chose.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nNow, for the rest of your life, you choose.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:06.000\nFuck you.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:07.000\nGiraffes don't choose.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:08.000\nWolves don't choose.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:09.000\nMoss doesn't choose.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:12.000\nHave fun choosing in pieces of shit.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nAnd they don't have labor pains.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nYour women now will.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nYeah, and now you're going to take a hoe to the earth\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:22.000\nand it's going to, you're going to break your back for nothing.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nYou're going to, everything you're going to experience.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nYou're a piece of shit because,\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:31.000\nbut in the warning to God before we ate that apple,\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:34.000\nsomebody said, you know, in that smoky room,\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nin one of the versions of Genesis said,\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:40.000\noh, they're going to be like us.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nIf they eat that fruit.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nThat's a bit out there for me to follow.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nLike, I don't know how to follow that.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:50.000\nThat's the same, theologically, just like supporting that,\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:53.000\nlike for thousands of years, but continue, please.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:58.000\nThere are some examples in the animal kingdom of cooperation\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nand there's, strangely enough,\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:04.000\nthere's also examples of animals fucking each other over.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:07.000\nOne example is where they had two elephants\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:10.000\nwho were given a rope to pull\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nand they had a pulley on it so that\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nif both of the elephants pulled at the same time,\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nthey would bring the food to them.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nAnd if only one of them pulled it,\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nthe rope would just go through the pulley.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:25.000\nSo, you know, the elephants didn't take too long\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nto figure out that they could cooperate and bring it over,\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nbut it wasn't too long after that\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nthat one of the elephants figured out\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nthat if he just put his foot on the rope,\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nthe other elephant would do all the work.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nYou know the same test they did with chimpanzees?\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:41.000\nThe exact same test.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nBut it wasn't a foot on the rope,\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nit was simply not cooperation.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nIt was the alpha chimp would go over\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nand unlock the beta chimp and say,\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nokay, same deal, let's bring the food to me.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nAnd the beta chimp, having been through\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\none iteration of the test,\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\noh, you mean the test where you get all the food?\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nFuck off.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nAnd there's also been tests with monkeys\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:05.000\nwhere they give cucumber and grapes,\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nand then if you underpay\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:10.000\nor give one set of monkeys the cucumber,\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:13.000\nthey get angry that you didn't give them grapes.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nSo that's sort of the long and the same line.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nBut while you were talking about all that,\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nit reminded me of something\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nI'd been thinking about for a while.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nThat is the pillars of morality.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.000\nAnd there's a lot of people who talk about it\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nin different ways,\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nand a lot of people say like,\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nthere's seven pillars of morality.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nThere's like the seven deadly sins\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:39.000\nand things like that they used to illustrate.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nBut the two pillars of morality for me\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:45.000\nare reciprocity and empathy.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:48.000\nAnd you can't have just one of those two things.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:51.000\nYou need both of them.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:55.000\nThe empathy allows you to know how to behave,\n\n17:55.000 --> 18:01.000\nand the reciprocity is you actually doing it.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\nLike you have to know that person needs a hug.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nThe reason that person is doing that\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:07.000\nis because they want to hug,\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nand then you have to hug them.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:12.000\nEmpathy is broken into two separate,\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nor yeah.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:19.000\nI'm sorry if I haven't thought about this for a while now.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nThere's...\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nOh, brain freeze.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nTalk, talk.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nChoice.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:31.000\nYou were holding a 40 ounce beer in your lap earlier.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:34.000\nWas that a 40 in a brown paper bag you were holding?\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nYes.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nI love you for that, by the way.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:41.000\nEverybody should have a 40 ounce in a brown paper bag.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:45.000\nYou know, the government has beaten you to that idea.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nIt's not turning out so good.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nWhat exactly does reciprocity mean?\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:53.000\nReciprocity, I mean, linguistically,\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:57.000\nit just means paying back whatever's been paid to you.\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nKind of a quid pro quo.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nIf I get something, I give something in return for that.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nIt could mean, it's not a moral attachment,\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nif you punch me in the face,\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nI'm reciprocating by punching you back in the face.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nIf you kiss me, I reciprocate by pitching you.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nAnd from a societal level,\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nreciprocity doesn't necessarily mean\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nthat you pay the person who gave you something back,\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nbut you can pay it forward as it were.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:21.000\nSo reciprocity isn't necessarily isolated\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:24.000\nto the two people involved in the transaction.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nOh, well, now you're beyond me.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nIt's a future tense, reciprocity?\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nYeah, yeah, that's how I think about it.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\nMaybe I'm wrong and it may be goofy,\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nbut the way that I think about it,\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:39.000\nyou know, I think as illustrated by my giving people stuff,\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:44.000\nis like, I feel like reciprocity is more represented by Gandhi\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:49.000\nand the idea that you sort of move things into the world\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nand then the world becomes like that.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:56.000\nOh, so acting as if everything is the way that it should be.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nThen the world reciprocates.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nYeah, you're going like, okay,\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:04.000\nwell, I'm not going to fall for the devil temptation\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:08.000\nof saying, well, what if this and what if that?\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nI'm going to do the thing that I would do\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:14.000\nif everybody did what everyone was supposed to do,\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:17.000\nwhich is what someone does when they pick up an aluminum can\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:20.000\nand drops it in a recycling bin in spite of knowing\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:24.000\nthat that single action will absolutely not stop anything\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nthat's going to make the earth die.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:29.000\nLike, that person, what they're doing is they're,\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.000\nyou're saying that that can be called reciprocation.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nI didn't know that.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nSo the other thing I was talking about,\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:41.000\nan empathy is broken into two different components.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:46.000\nThere is affective, I think it is, and perceptive.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:49.000\nAnd one type of empathy is your ability to perceive\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nhow another person feels,\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nand the other one is your ability to know what to do\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nto make the person feel better.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nAnd so without one of those two components,\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:01.000\nyou end up with either sociopaths who actually know what to do,\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nbut don't feel that they should,\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:08.000\nor you end up with autistic people who know what to do,\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:11.000\nbut have no idea when to do it.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:17.000\nThe latter is if you know everything that everyone wants\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nall the time and you hate them for it,\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nis that that you're probably autistic, right?\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:25.000\nLike, you're not a sociopath, for sure.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nYou're definitely more towards autistic.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nCan you do a Jeff Fox with the comedy routine?\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:35.000\nYou might be autistic.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:38.000\nIt wouldn't be as funny as Jeff Fox with his movies.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nWhat was yours?\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nCan't make eye contact.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nYes, if you can't make eye contact,\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:47.000\nbut you know that you should, you might be autistic.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:51.000\nIf someone tells you that they need a hug from you\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nto make themselves feel better,\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:56.000\nand your thought is that you should respect me more,\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:59.000\nyou might be autistic.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:02.000\nYeah, it's not funny.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:03.000\nIt's a diagnosis.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:08.000\nDiagnoses aren't funny.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:13.000\nIf you know the diagnosis, isn't funny.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nAll right, thank you, Beef Steak Bill.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nBeef Steak Bill!\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:21.000\nBeef Steak Bill used to be Beef Fungus Bill,\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nand then he was lowered to the Lava,\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:27.000\nand he emerged as the Galvatron.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nIt's possible to reinvent yourself here.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:31.000\nErin did a very...\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:35.000\nI mean, we spent 45 minutes talking about him.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nYeah, I listened to that. It was fantastic.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nHow many levels will he have to go through\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nto get Beef out of his nickname?\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:42.000\nWho knows?\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:46.000\nHe may one day end up being just like...\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nDr. Beef.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:51.000\nMaybe the next level is he just issues Bill.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:54.000\nHe already has only one L in the word Bill.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:59.000\nThat's vestigial. That can go.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nLet's bring our good friends to the stage\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:04.000\nfaster than normal tonight, as I got Nathan,\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:08.000\nbut I want to talk to them about brain-putting\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nand morality and choices,\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nand how you know the difference between good and bad,\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:14.000\nbecause we have a quiet, intimate, awesome audience,\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nand we're going to get to the fucking...\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nWe're going to make everyone jealous next episode.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nWe're embarking to the moon tonight.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nWell, psychologically.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nYes.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nI want everybody who comes next week,\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\neveryone who listens to go,\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nshit, fuck, are you kidding me?\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nFor breaking bad, I missed this?\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.000\nYeah.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nWhat the people listening don't know\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nis that you've had your shirt off the entire time.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nAll right, Kumail Nanjiani, can you come out here?\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:45.000\nCan you come out here?\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nHello, hello.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nNice. I like that.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nKumail's wearing a t-shirt that has a very...\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.000\nIs this a new thing, the kind of watermark logo?\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nOh, does it look watermark?\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nIt's just a free t-shirt I got at this place.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nIt says the conjuring on it.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nDo you think that's typical to that film,\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:11.000\nthat it's sort of faded into the thread of the shirt,\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nor is that a new thing?\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nI think the movie... Have you seen the movie?\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.000\nNo.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nIt sort of captures the vibe of the movie.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\nSchrab talked about it last week.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:21.000\nDid you like it?\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nI don't think so. I can't remember.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nYou liked it?\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nI have a theory on morality.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nI don't know, it's not a novel.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nBut I think what makes us human\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:35.000\nis complexity of language and society,\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nand I think morality is just what you need\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nto live in a society.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nAnd how I think it ties into science\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:44.000\nis that the brains that are made\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:47.000\nto sort of be able to differentiate right and wrong,\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\ni.e. what works in a society and what doesn't,\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:52.000\nare the ones evolutionarily that will stick around.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:55.000\nSo for instance, if you have a brain that makes you fuck kids,\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nyou're not going to have any more kids,\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:00.000\nbecause kids can't have kids, so you'll go away.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nSo I think that's...\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:03.000\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nKids can't have kids?\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nLike, you know, like a three-year-old,\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nI don't think they can have a kid.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nAnd I don't think pedophiles, I think,\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\ndraw the line at like 14, because then\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nI think that's when we kind of take over, you know?\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nNot that we're excited about this.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nListen, come on, bro.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nEverybody!\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:28.000\nDon't bro me. Don't bro me on 14.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nYou've seen some 16-year-olds where you're like,\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nall right.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nYou said 14 first, by the way.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nI was trying to make a point.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:38.000\nWell, you know with the hormones in milk these days,\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nand I don't know.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:43.000\nSee, but look how fun it is to frolic in that surf.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:46.000\nAnd we all go, ah, you, ah, da, da, da, da, da.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nAnd then there's the six-foot drop-off\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:51.000\nthat we all go, don't go out there.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nWell, but I really don't think it's that\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:56.000\nif all of us want to do it, and we know not to,\n\n25:56.000 --> 26:00.000\nI think it's a messed up broken brain that wants to do it.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nBecause evolutionarily and scientifically,\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:05.000\nit doesn't make sense to be attracted to a child.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:08.000\nIt's not what leads to the survival of our species.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nSo when he got that thinker out of his brain,\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.000\nit fucked him up.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nBy the way, we should all be lucky that we hit the lottery\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nof not being attracted to kids.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:20.000\nLike, that could have been something that could have happened to us.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nBut this is what I'm talking about.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:25.000\nWhy do we act like they are, like,\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:29.000\nand first I'm gonna say, this is a daisy chain of weird logic\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:32.000\nthat I want to lead probably to nowhere\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nbecause greater men than me have tried to think about this.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:37.000\nBut the first link in the daisy chain is to go,\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:41.000\nwhy do we act like a guy who wants to fuck a three-year-old\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:44.000\nis the same as a Nazi war criminal\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nthat we're trying to hunt down and go,\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nno, you fucked up.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nYou thought you were back in the right horse.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:51.000\nYou made a choice.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:54.000\nBecause they did make a choice to fuck a kid.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nYou can want to fuck a kid.\n\n26:56.000 --> 27:01.000\nNo, no, no. Okay, well, let's wipe that off the magnet board.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:06.000\nYeah, like actually hurting a kid, affecting their future,\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nwhich then vampirically turns them probably\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:12.000\nas we've seen into another abuser of children.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:15.000\nThat's the problem. That's 90% of the problem.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:20.000\nBut the impulse itself, the hard drive,\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:24.000\nthe guy who wants to look at a calendar\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nwhere January is a three-year-old kid\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:29.000\nlaying on a rug in front of a fireplace.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:30.000\nAll right.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:31.000\nOkay, so...\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nI feel like the printer would have a couple questions,\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:38.000\nbut I don't know if you can mass-produce that.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nIs the money calendar ready?\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nThat's kind of a DIY kind of thing.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:45.000\nYeah, collage scissors.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:49.000\nThe impulse, the predilection, like why...\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:55.000\nI know the answer, I think, is because it's easy.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:59.000\nBecause we all, as Americans, we lack...\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nAnd humans.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:03.000\nWe lack outlets for outrage.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:11.000\nWe think we're encouraged to be fucking loud.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nWe're encouraged to...\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:18.000\nEmily Post did not write the rules to American society.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:21.000\nIt's sort of very ethnocentric,\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nit's just knowing what's happening here.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nYeah, and what's happening here\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nhas been happening here for the last eight years.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:31.000\nIf you go back further than eight years now,\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:34.000\nthis is like Alexis de Tocqueville on Overdrive,\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:39.000\nwhat came before us, we have no respect for it.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:40.000\nWe spit on it.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nWe don't care.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:44.000\nIf you, like John Ritter, you thought he was funny,\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:45.000\ngo fuck yourself.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:50.000\nWe've burrowed into ourselves,\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:55.000\nand have originally, us doing that,\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:56.000\ntook over the planet.\n\n28:56.000 --> 29:00.000\nWe said fuck culture, fuck bloodlines,\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:06.000\nfuck heredity, fuck everything,\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:09.000\nbut what's going on right here, right now,\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nand it was a glorious...\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:14.000\nThomas Edison took that ball and ran with it.\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:15.000\nThis is sort of a weird thing,\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:18.000\nbut right after September 11th, 2001,\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nI can't believe I have to specify that,\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:23.000\nbut I was here and I had some...\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:29.000\nI sort of podcast listeners, I'm a brown-skinned man.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nI had people yell stuff at me,\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:34.000\nand a lot of times, and this is just what happened,\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:37.000\nI'm not putting any judgment on any sort of higher point,\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nexcept that there were a lot of black people\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nwho said really bad stuff to me,\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:45.000\nand I'm like, you should understand what discrimination feels like,\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nbecause you go through it every day.\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:50.000\nWhy can you not put yourself in my shoes\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nand understand that it's the same thing that's happening?\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nIt's because we just want to...\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nI don't know what it is.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nIt's like there's the kick-the-dog theory,\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nthat any pain that's put on you,\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nif you get yelled at by your boss,\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nyou yell the person beneath him, and he yells at his wife,\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:07.000\nand she yells at the son, the son kicks the dog,\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:08.000\nand the dog can't...\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nRight now, we're the dog.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:18.000\nDo you think that if a black person exalts in doing that to you,\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:22.000\nis that just kind of like the joy of having someone to do that to you?\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nIt's reciprocation.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nWithout empathy.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nIt's patriotic reciprocation.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nPaying it forward.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nPaying it forward.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:36.000\nI think that is the history of...\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:41.000\nWhite racists are fond of evoking turn of the century,\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:42.000\nkind of like,\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:45.000\nremember what the Irish did and the Jewish had to do?\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:52.000\nWhen they hear the reverse-reverse racism often is...\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:53.000\nThe idea is,\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:57.000\noh, all kinds of people had it bad over here in this melting pot.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nWhat they're sort of lifting up\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nand celebrating is actually part of the problem,\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nwhich is that shit rolls down ill,\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nthat you don't end up,\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:12.000\nwhen you've been at the end of a stick,\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:16.000\nyou typically do not end up grabbing the stick out of the hand\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:20.000\nthat's holding it and beating the face of the person that held it.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:24.000\nYou typically end up kind of coming into your own,\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:28.000\nlike, oh, I got a little star in my chest now.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nRemember, when I was just getting hit,\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nnow I'm hitting people,\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nbut it's not typically the guy that was hitting you.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:40.000\nBut I think it's interesting to sort of think of morality as...\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nYou know, if you think of it,\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nyou said something,\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\noh, why do we judge people, not judge,\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:49.000\nbut why do we demonize people who are attracted to kids?\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:52.000\nBecause it's against what makes a society work,\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nbecause it gets fucked up kids\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nand these kids are not going to go to war.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:59.000\nBut why don't we look at them the same way we look at someone who has a cold?\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:02.000\nWhen someone has snot dripping down their face,\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nwhich makes them disgusting,\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:07.000\nbecause it's easier, but if someone walks in...\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:10.000\nWait, you can't say it's easier to judge pedophiles and walk on stage.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:13.000\nLike, it's a big victory lap.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:16.000\nNo, but here's what it...\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nAdam, it must be said to the listener,\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:21.000\nis standing one-third the way toward the stage right now.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:24.000\nHe can only be described as an ominous pose.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nI really...\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.000\nI think he's being sated himself on chips.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:33.000\nBecause I think being attracted to kids is not a crime.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nActing on it is.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nNo, no, wait, yeah, that's... Yes.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nYeah, and so I think those people,\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nour brains are made, oh, hey, Adam.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nHello, Adam.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nFor a different perspective.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nI agree with Kamel's point,\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:52.000\nbut I want to say the reason that it's so easy to kick shit down...\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nBy the way, I just want to say one thing.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nThere's not a lot of people here,\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nbut don't say anything you'll regret.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:02.000\nDon't reveal too much while you're defending.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:06.000\nNo, it's because the reason that it's so fun to be like,\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nwell, I was being kicked around school,\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nI used to be bullied, now I'm the bully,\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:14.000\nis because you see the part of yourself that's ready to be bullied again.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:18.000\nYou have to fill yourself up with the confidence that says,\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nwell, I'm not going to be victimized,\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nbecause I'm victimizing someone else that hard.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:27.000\nIt's the same reason we have a lot of closeted religious people,\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:30.000\nand they're the ones who are most going after homosexuals.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:31.000\nAnd I also... Yeah, sorry.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nYeah, you use your rage.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nIt feels good to turn someone else into the scapegoat,\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:36.000\nbecause you're not the scapegoat.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nBecause everyone has the same fiber in their being.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nWe all have the same biological organism.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nWe all have the same teeth in our mouth,\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:46.000\nand we all have the same weird fucking aggressive bullshit.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:50.000\nBut the weird thing is, all of us have to take shits.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\nI've said this a million times before,\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:55.000\nI say certain things, and as people say,\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:56.000\nyeah, but people want to do this,\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nespecially about my thoughts about hierarchy.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:01.000\nAnd I'm very, very like...\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nI don't want to say resentful of this,\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:06.000\nbut when I talk about hierarchy,\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nwhen I talk about anarchy versus hierarchy,\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nand anarchy is simply, it's not lawlessness,\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:13.000\nit's not lack of order, it's simply the lack of hierarchy.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:18.000\nAnd then I'll get the Reddit sub thread thing,\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nlike people will chime in from Alaska,\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nfrom their little dungeons.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nWell, Dan Harmon, if you don't like hierarchy,\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nwhy do you have a Harmontown?\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:27.000\nHow about that?\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:28.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nWhy are you standing and talking in a stage?\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nIs that the opposite of blah, blah, blah, blah?\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:35.000\nIsn't hierarchy inherent to human beings?\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nIsn't it instinctive?\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:42.000\nShit-taking is inherent to human beings.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:46.000\nPoop comes out of your butt so many times a day.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:49.000\nWe are not walking around in an average way.\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nHow many times on average?\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.000\nThat should be average of one.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:53.000\nSix to seven.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nWhoa, okay.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:58.000\nWe should talk about that first.\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:01.000\nIf we're going to be in a spaceship to the moon together.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:02.000\nYeah.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nWe were going to make it to the moon,\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:06.000\nbut then Dan shit into our toilet.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:09.000\nBelieve me, Harmontown won the castle that goes first.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:10.000\nThat is just your shit.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nIt's 90% bathroom.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:15.000\nWell, here's the thing, I think the ultimate sort of...\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nBecause there's going to be a tub in there.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nIt's not going to shower while we're going to the moon.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:23.000\nI think human nature, which is what you're talking about,\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nGoldberg and you guys are talking about,\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nwhich is sort of the urge to be better than someone,\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:31.000\nis so at odds with what a just sustainable society is.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nThat's the problem, I think.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:36.000\nIf you think of the Nazi society, that's not a sustainable society.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nTaliban, that's not a sustainable society.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:41.000\nSustainable society has no hierarchy like what you're saying.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:44.000\nI think there are people that would say that compassion,\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nthere was a community that was compassionate\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:49.000\nand they cared for the elderly and they looked after the sick\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:53.000\nand they dealt as a group with criminal elements\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:57.000\nor maybe psychotic or psychopathic elements or antisocial elements.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nThat would be great.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nThat would be awesome, but nothing would get invented,\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:02.000\nnothing would get done.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nI think people say that it's that drive,\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:08.000\nthat competition, that capitalist competitiveness\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:13.000\ncreates our ability to grow and to drive to succeed.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nI think may or may not be true,\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:18.000\nbut I think what societies lack,\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nespecially when capitalism is involved,\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:23.000\nis simple compassion because it's not sexy,\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:26.000\nit doesn't get anybody anywhere.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:29.000\nThere's no reciprocity in that.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:32.000\nThere's no barter system in compassion.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:36.000\nThat should be the paying forward of if I do something right\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nand the golden rule.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:41.000\nI think all major religions say in some way or other,\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:45.000\ndo unto others what you'd have them do unto you.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:49.000\nSome say don't do unto others what you wouldn't want them to do to you,\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:52.000\nbut I think the better way to say it is to actually go out of your way\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:56.000\nand do something that you're doing for no profit at all\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nbecause it profits many.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:02.000\nSociety, that's the most basic candidate that society is built on.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nDo unto others what you would have them do.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nYou watch people, especially in big cities,\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:11.000\nand let's say you're a creative person, you're an artist,\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nyou're a writer, you're a painter,\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nand you're driven to do something creative,\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.000\nand you're watching people that have this other thing called ambition,\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nand they're not as talented as you,\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nbut they're really fucking good in a room,\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nand they're really driven.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nThey're at a party.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nYou should be talking to that person.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nNo, I don't like talking to people.\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:33.000\nI like painting. I'll go home and paint for fucking free.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:36.000\nYou sit home and watch the Emmys, and you watch a bunch of people\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:40.000\nthat some got lucky and were artists and happened, and it all happened,\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:44.000\nand you're surrounded in a room full of people that I think are absolute con artists\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nand bullies and dickheads.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:49.000\nI'm going to go the other direction on this one for you, Jeff,\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nbecause it's not a binary.\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:54.000\nIt's not a binary between capitalist and anarchist\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:57.000\nbecause a lot of the things that we give credit for for capitalism\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nhappen under protectionist governments.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:04.000\nHappened because you couldn't buy grain from England for a lot of the 19th century\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nfor the 20th century.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:08.000\nYou couldn't buy cars from Japan until suddenly you could,\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nand then the 80s were filled with the idea,\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\noh, Japan's going to take over.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:16.000\nBut the part that really, it's not a duality between being ambitious\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:17.000\nand being creative.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nIt's not a knob that you turn one way or the other.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:22.000\nThere's nothing wrong with getting paid what you're worth,\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:25.000\nand there's nothing wrong with learning to be the person who talks a little,\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nyou know, kisses a little ass.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nThe motivation is blind ambition.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:33.000\nThere's people that are motivated simply by the need to rise up a ladder.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nAnd that's society.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:38.000\nThat's, you know, that's Parisian culture and the restoration.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:41.000\nI'm just simply using people to get your ends out of things.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nIt's why Rome fell.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:48.000\nBut we've slid into, I mean, all these are choices.\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nWe're all choosing the words that we're going to say.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:51.000\nWe're all forming policy.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nWe're going to talk politics.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:54.000\nWe're going to talk philosophy.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:57.000\nWe're going to talk about the people that came before us, the mistakes that they've\n\n38:57.000 --> 39:01.000\nmade, the problem with the way things are, the true motivation of the people around us\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:02.000\nand all these things.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:07.000\nBut at the core, at the deeper core of that, we don't even have our shit together\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:13.000\nenough to look at a guy who hid his head so hard that he wants to fuck a three-year-old\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:17.000\nand go, are you all right?\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:20.000\nWe want to arrest that person.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:21.000\nThat's the problem.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:27.000\nLike, we can't endure the equivalent of a head cold in terms of personality.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nWe can't allow anyone to have a bad day.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:32.000\nWell then, okay, what do you propose we do with that person?\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:33.000\nI don't know.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:40.000\nI propose that we stop proposing because we are more jellyfish.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\nWe are 90% jellyfish.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:47.000\nWe share more DNA with a watermelon than we do with whatever we haven't discovered yet.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:50.000\nWe are aqueous characters.\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:53.000\nWe are things that flow.\n\n39:53.000 --> 40:00.000\nWe just finished eating each other's faces and genitals off under a tree, fighting for\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:01.000\nshade.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nWe have risen so much.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:04.000\nIt was a great tree.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:05.000\nIt was a great tree.\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:06.000\nI'm talking about the 50s.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:09.000\nThat was the last Harmontown at the...\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:10.000\nThat's Sullivan Theatre.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:14.000\nThe 1950s were a rough time for all of us down.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:24.000\nThe idea that there's a threshold that we have to cross, the idea of being reminded of\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:27.000\nour frailty, when you see somebody who's been bonked on the head, when you see somebody\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:31.600\nwho's homeless, when you see somebody who's having a bad week or having a bad time, being\n\n40:31.600 --> 40:33.000\nreminded of our frailty is terrifying.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:37.240\nHow about being reminded of the fact that the conscious personality, the person that\n\n40:37.240 --> 40:45.480\nyou interact with in line at a football stadium, when you engage in the wonderful, beautiful\n\n40:45.480 --> 40:51.000\nact of not ripping another primate's face off while you're waiting in line for a beer.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:56.600\nWhen we drive to and from work every day, the entire planet, all these lights that you\n\n40:56.600 --> 41:02.760\nsee as you fly in these aircraft that don't go down over these cities where there aren't\n\n41:02.760 --> 41:09.560\nexplosions happening because it's not World War Z yet, be reminded of the fact that this\n\n41:09.560 --> 41:15.000\noutward face that creates all that compatibility, clearly by the fact that America's prison\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:24.640\npopulation is rising and rising and rising, we obviously are capable of functioning in\n\n41:24.640 --> 41:31.480\nsociety with repressing a certain amount of the animal within.\n\n41:31.480 --> 41:38.080\nWe are now at a point where we need to grow up enough to accept the animal within.\n\n41:38.080 --> 41:47.880\nThe internet is creating glory holes in the wall between everything that you're allowed\n\n41:47.880 --> 41:54.560\nto say in line at the bank and everything that you actually think and feel, and they're\n\n41:54.560 --> 42:04.120\nspurting out, like creating these little seismic, these yellow stones, and our reaction is\n\n42:04.120 --> 42:08.760\nwe're flocking to those and we're going, look at this unfortunate, no, we're hitting\n\n42:08.760 --> 42:12.000\nthem with hammers and then creating ones a little down the line that we can stick our\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:13.000\ndicks in.\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:20.240\nWe are obviously a gigantic eye, this is eyes wide shut, we are fucked up people.\n\n42:20.240 --> 42:23.560\nWe are, but okay, here's going back to when I said, what do you propose we do?\n\n42:23.560 --> 42:28.880\nWhen you said, I propose to not propose, but how does society deal with someone who's fucking\n\n42:28.880 --> 42:29.880\nkids?\n\n42:29.880 --> 42:32.600\nLike, at the core of it, like what do you say we do?\n\n42:32.600 --> 42:34.800\nWe have to demonize that person.\n\n42:34.800 --> 42:35.800\nLauren take the stage.\n\n42:35.800 --> 42:36.800\nSorry, I've been late.\n\n42:36.800 --> 42:39.800\nFinally, let's get a woman up on the stage of douchebag men, can we please?\n\n42:39.800 --> 42:41.800\nYeah, I get your chair.\n\n42:41.800 --> 42:49.800\nAdam, you can, oh, she just, shit rolls downhill Lauren.\n\n42:49.800 --> 42:53.080\nSpencer to the stage to take Adam's mic away from him.\n\n42:53.080 --> 42:54.080\nSpencer.\n\n42:54.080 --> 42:57.600\nI think you, I think you know who you were in that metaphor.\n\n42:57.600 --> 42:59.600\nYeah, get up there.\n\n42:59.600 --> 43:00.600\nYeah.\n\n43:00.600 --> 43:04.920\nAdam tried to use Spencer's throne and I will not have that.\n\n43:04.920 --> 43:05.920\nI'm sorry.\n\n43:05.920 --> 43:10.520\nI've been really wanting to engage in this discussion because I lived in Amsterdam studying\n\n43:10.520 --> 43:17.120\ngender and sexuality for a while and we actually interviewed pedophiles, pedophiles.\n\n43:17.120 --> 43:18.400\nThere was like the day that pedophiles.\n\n43:18.400 --> 43:21.480\nDid you lower them with like kids?\n\n43:21.480 --> 43:25.200\nOh, hey, you're one, couple questions.\n\n43:25.200 --> 43:29.720\nYeah, no, there was like, it was really weird.\n\n43:29.720 --> 43:33.880\nIt was like on the syllabus, like the day that pedophiles are coming to class.\n\n43:33.880 --> 43:37.360\nAnd how did they, can I ask you one very basic question?\n\n43:37.360 --> 43:41.400\nWhen I think of pedophile in my head, I think I have a specific, what did they look like?\n\n43:41.400 --> 43:42.400\nLike that?\n\n43:42.400 --> 43:43.400\nYes.\n\n43:43.400 --> 43:44.400\nOkay.\n\n43:44.400 --> 43:47.400\nWait, they showed up saying, hello, I'm a, I'm a pedophile.\n\n43:47.400 --> 43:49.840\nThey're out of the closet about it?\n\n43:49.840 --> 43:50.840\nYeah.\n\n43:50.840 --> 43:55.680\nSome people don't like fucking kids and there's me, hi, James Robinson's the name, pedophilia\n\n43:55.680 --> 43:56.680\nis the game.\n\n43:56.680 --> 43:57.680\nYeah.\n\n43:57.680 --> 44:00.720\nThey were, this was the Netherlands.\n\n44:00.720 --> 44:04.680\nSo you have to keep that in mind there, you know, well, they're, they're, they're, they're\n\n44:04.680 --> 44:07.680\nthe Dutch have been fucking kids for centuries.\n\n44:07.680 --> 44:12.520\nYou can just go into coffee shops where you find, there's whole, there's whole restaurants\n\n44:12.520 --> 44:19.720\nwhere it's just kids on platters and then it says, anyway, but they don't like pedophilia,\n\n44:19.720 --> 44:20.720\nright?\n\n44:20.720 --> 44:21.720\nYeah.\n\n44:21.720 --> 44:22.720\nLike both of these guys had been to jail.\n\n44:22.720 --> 44:23.720\nYeah.\n\n44:23.720 --> 44:26.720\nSo there's a hard line between what they're open about and pedophilia, but go ahead.\n\n44:26.720 --> 44:27.720\nSorry.\n\n44:27.720 --> 44:31.480\nNo, what they're open about is talking about it and researching it and that sort of thing.\n\n44:31.480 --> 44:36.200\nAnyway, so, uh, yeah, they came to class and it was these two guys and one of them was\n\n44:36.200 --> 44:40.960\nlike, yeah, I, you know, I, I really like five year old girls.\n\n44:40.960 --> 44:41.960\nIt was creepy.\n\n44:41.960 --> 44:45.480\nLike, no, like I like had a big problem with it, but, but you're studying it.\n\n44:45.480 --> 44:46.480\nYou're creepy about it.\n\n44:46.480 --> 44:47.480\nYeah.\n\n44:47.480 --> 44:48.480\nYeah.\n\n44:48.480 --> 44:49.480\nOkay.\n\n44:49.480 --> 44:55.160\nBut what they talked about was their, you know, like their mission is to not fuck children.\n\n44:55.160 --> 44:56.160\nYeah.\n\n44:56.160 --> 44:57.160\nSo that's their struggle.\n\n44:57.160 --> 44:58.800\nI have to not run red lights.\n\n44:58.800 --> 44:59.800\nThey have to not.\n\n44:59.800 --> 45:05.040\nI mean, I'm just saying we all have these struggles and the moral choice is to not do the immoral\n\n45:05.040 --> 45:06.040\nthing.\n\n45:06.040 --> 45:07.040\nOkay.\n\n45:07.040 --> 45:08.040\nGo ahead.\n\n45:08.040 --> 45:09.320\nAnd it didn't, like it didn't make them any less creepy.\n\n45:09.320 --> 45:14.560\nLike, like they, they talked openly about how like they had to work to avoid going to\n\n45:14.560 --> 45:18.720\nplaygrounds and inviting little boys to sit on their lap and like, yeah.\n\n45:18.720 --> 45:24.040\nSo, so their, their AA is saying like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm six months sober off of fucking\n\n45:24.040 --> 45:25.040\nchildren.\n\n45:25.040 --> 45:26.040\nYeah.\n\n45:26.040 --> 45:27.040\nYeah.\n\n45:27.040 --> 45:28.040\nTotally.\n\n45:28.040 --> 45:29.560\nAnd not just, not just fucking them, but like looking at them, you know, like they like\n\n45:29.560 --> 45:32.320\nhave to like avoid situations where they're around children.\n\n45:32.320 --> 45:33.320\nSure.\n\n45:33.320 --> 45:34.320\nYeah.\n\n45:34.320 --> 45:35.320\nWhat were you going to say, Camille?\n\n45:35.320 --> 45:36.320\nNothing.\n\n45:36.320 --> 45:39.520\nI, you know, like a little chip, like you get a little chip, like it's been six months\n\n45:39.520 --> 45:44.040\nand then everyone claps like, great, good for you.\n\n45:44.040 --> 45:47.920\nI had a relapse last night.\n\n45:47.920 --> 45:48.920\nBut here's the thing.\n\n45:48.920 --> 45:50.120\nThat's what I'm saying, Dan.\n\n45:50.120 --> 45:54.360\nI don't understand what you're saying when you say, like, well, how are you proposing\n\n45:54.360 --> 45:55.360\nwe are?\n\n45:55.360 --> 45:57.440\nWhy is our attitude towards pedophilia wrong?\n\n45:57.440 --> 46:01.680\nWe've sat on the stage and talked about the, the topic of people who get turned down by\n\n46:01.680 --> 46:06.080\neating shit or having being shit on or shitting on other people came up and immediately we\n\n46:06.080 --> 46:10.880\ndefaulted to as hilarious as it is, like, like letting those people know, should one\n\n46:10.880 --> 46:14.520\nof them be in the audience, letting those people know that what they need to do is continue\n\n46:14.520 --> 46:16.160\nto be ashamed of themselves.\n\n46:16.160 --> 46:21.360\nI, at the same time, anytime we say something even slightly wrong politically, we get immediately\n\n46:21.360 --> 46:26.120\nfucking, you know, some poor girl came up here whose only crime was what?\n\n46:26.120 --> 46:30.680\nBeing part of a fucking bell curve mentality, like saying something that eight years ago\n\n46:30.680 --> 46:35.520\nwould have functioned as something that progressively to say about gay people are, and immediately\n\n46:35.520 --> 46:40.680\ngot jumped on by this LA fucking, like, well, I wasn't here for that, but I think you can\n\n46:40.680 --> 46:42.720\nhold people accountable for their opinions.\n\n46:42.720 --> 46:46.360\nI think, I think people can be wrong, and it's okay to say that they're wrong.\n\n46:46.360 --> 46:48.240\nAgain, I didn't listen to that episode, but...\n\n46:48.240 --> 46:51.320\nI said that people that want to be pooped on, people that want to be peed on, people\n\n46:51.320 --> 46:54.320\nthat want to dress as a lizard, people that want to fuck a dog, people that want to suck\n\n46:54.320 --> 46:55.320\na dog's dick.\n\n46:55.320 --> 46:56.320\nOkay.\n\n46:56.320 --> 46:57.320\nOkay.\n\n46:57.320 --> 46:58.320\nNow my dog's involved.\n\n46:58.320 --> 46:59.320\nNow your dog's involved.\n\n46:59.320 --> 47:00.320\nIt's a fuzzy line.\n\n47:00.320 --> 47:01.320\nIt's a fuzzy line.\n\n47:01.320 --> 47:02.320\nIs the dog into it?\n\n47:02.320 --> 47:06.320\nBut we're not, we're not, I think the, I think the fundamental, like, plexiglass between\n\n47:06.320 --> 47:10.680\nmy Indiana Jones and your Cobra right now is that...\n\n47:10.680 --> 47:11.680\nWhy am I the Cobra?\n\n47:11.680 --> 47:13.680\nI'm the one against pedophiles.\n\n47:13.680 --> 47:15.680\nHow am I the Cobra?\n\n47:15.680 --> 47:16.680\nYou're right.\n\n47:16.680 --> 47:17.680\nSorry.\n\n47:17.680 --> 47:18.680\nI'll flip them.\n\n47:18.680 --> 47:19.680\nI'll flip them.\n\n47:19.680 --> 47:20.680\nSorry.\n\n47:20.680 --> 47:21.680\nI'm the Cobra.\n\n47:21.680 --> 47:22.680\nNo, no, no.\n\n47:22.680 --> 47:23.680\nGo ahead.\n\n47:23.680 --> 47:24.680\nGo ahead.\n\n47:24.680 --> 47:26.680\nIs that, like, anyone who's doing anything that's hurting another person, blah, blah,\n\n47:26.680 --> 47:33.720\nblah, blah, like, it seems like there's a clean line there where it's like you're...\n\n47:33.720 --> 47:40.000\nThe problem that I'm talking about is that what we do is we're, because that's a reprehensible\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:45.280\nconcept, we, the internet has created this idea.\n\n47:45.280 --> 47:53.240\nIt's like, come on, I've been on 4chan, like, you, like, there's, you can computer generate\n\n47:53.240 --> 47:54.240\nimages now.\n\n47:54.240 --> 48:03.800\nSo you can make a 8-foot blue woman with a giant cock, fucking a 3-foot Ewok, like,\n\n48:03.800 --> 48:09.160\nand the dick is like coming up out of her mouth because the blue woman's dick is fucking\n\n48:09.160 --> 48:10.160\nit so hard.\n\n48:10.160 --> 48:13.240\nSo the blue woman's dick is over 3 feet long.\n\n48:13.240 --> 48:14.240\nYeah.\n\n48:14.240 --> 48:15.240\nSomeone's jerking off to this.\n\n48:15.240 --> 48:16.240\nOkay.\n\n48:16.240 --> 48:17.240\nWell, that's fine.\n\n48:17.240 --> 48:18.240\nSomeone's jerking off.\n\n48:18.240 --> 48:19.240\nI'm fine with that.\n\n48:19.240 --> 48:23.080\nI'm also fine with, if you're attracted to kids, drawing a picture of a kid and masturbating\n\n48:23.080 --> 48:24.080\nto it.\n\n48:24.080 --> 48:25.080\nI'm fine with that.\n\n48:25.080 --> 48:27.080\nBut when there's a victim, when there's a crime...\n\n48:27.080 --> 48:28.080\nWell, then there's nobody...\n\n48:28.080 --> 48:29.080\nOkay.\n\n48:29.080 --> 48:30.080\nYeah.\n\n48:30.080 --> 48:31.080\nI want that on TMZ tomorrow.\n\n48:31.080 --> 48:32.080\nKamehameha Nagyani.\n\n48:32.080 --> 48:39.720\nI'm going to have to report it last night and say I'm fine with jerking off to a picture\n\n48:39.720 --> 48:40.720\nof...\n\n48:40.720 --> 48:41.720\nOkay.\n\n48:41.720 --> 48:42.720\nSo way out of context.\n\n48:42.720 --> 48:43.720\nNo, it's not.\n\n48:43.720 --> 48:44.720\nThat was in context.\n\n48:44.720 --> 48:47.520\nNo, but I'm saying when there's a victim, everything changes.\n\n48:47.520 --> 48:50.520\nIf the victim is a dog or a child, everything changes.\n\n48:50.520 --> 48:51.520\nBut we're not talking...\n\n48:51.520 --> 48:55.560\nI was talking about perception, morality, pornography.\n\n48:55.560 --> 48:58.120\nWait, you're standing up and have your hand up.\n\n48:58.120 --> 49:00.440\nNo, I just wanted to change it.\n\n49:00.440 --> 49:01.440\nCome on up here.\n\n49:01.440 --> 49:02.440\nShow my mic.\n\n49:02.440 --> 49:08.760\nWe're basically talking about is consent.\n\n49:08.760 --> 49:09.760\nIf somebody says...\n\n49:09.760 --> 49:17.200\nBecause in our country, particularly, each state even has this ability to say at what\n\n49:17.200 --> 49:23.880\nage you are allowed to say yes, and your mind has developed enough to say yes to activities.\n\n49:23.880 --> 49:29.320\nWe demonize pedophilia because in our country...\n\n49:29.320 --> 49:34.280\nBecause we're worried about people looking at stuff, the same way we worry about Dungeons\n\n49:34.280 --> 49:37.320\nand Dragons when I was 12, by the way.\n\n49:37.320 --> 49:38.320\nI'm increasing...\n\n49:38.320 --> 49:39.320\nAre you saying...\n\n49:39.320 --> 49:42.640\nI'm wading into the tarpets of being a pedophilia advocate.\n\n49:42.640 --> 49:48.200\nYou really are, because are you suggesting that in 20 years, people are like, hey, those\n\n49:48.200 --> 49:52.360\npeople were okay, but that's part of the problem.\n\n49:52.360 --> 49:56.160\nI want to be a reciprocist.\n\n49:56.160 --> 50:02.440\nI want to actually make the fucking headway of going, you know what, even though it's not...\n\n50:02.440 --> 50:07.880\nThe easiest thing in the world for everyone collectively is to go, well, looking at a\n\n50:07.880 --> 50:13.280\npicture of this or reading a story about this, we can all agree that's disgusting, and the\n\n50:13.280 --> 50:20.240\nreason is because it's directly linked to behavior that is the definition of criminal.\n\n50:20.240 --> 50:21.240\nSure.\n\n50:21.240 --> 50:22.240\nAnd immoral.\n\n50:22.240 --> 50:23.240\nYes.\n\n50:23.240 --> 50:27.800\nAnd then we scale that one back, it's like we're in the surf, the internet is creating\n\n50:27.800 --> 50:33.480\na surf between the unconscious and conscious minds.\n\n50:33.480 --> 50:38.080\nAnd it's like people are...\n\n50:38.080 --> 50:40.200\nWhat I propose, I don't know.\n\n50:40.200 --> 50:47.640\nI would propose that we propose less because we're being very, very clear as the internet\n\n50:47.640 --> 50:48.640\nis...\n\n50:48.640 --> 50:52.480\nAnd believe me, like 30 years from now...\n\n50:52.480 --> 50:56.480\nI'll be six feet in the ground, and I think I'm pretty sure...\n\n50:56.480 --> 51:00.120\nGive yourself 40 years or so.\n\n51:00.120 --> 51:01.120\nMaybe if I cut down...\n\n51:01.120 --> 51:03.120\nYou wanted a doctor and your doctor...\n\n51:03.120 --> 51:07.280\nI'll be watching this from my porch on the rocking chair, but people are going to be\n\n51:07.280 --> 51:12.320\nflicking a switch, you know, on the back of their head or whatever the equivalent is,\n\n51:12.320 --> 51:18.840\nand you're going to be able to simulate you're an octopus and your neighbor's dog is coming\n\n51:18.840 --> 51:20.440\nover for tea.\n\n51:20.440 --> 51:23.520\nAnd you've got eight dicks to fuck it with.\n\n51:23.520 --> 51:28.560\nThat's the thing, though, is that if you're doing it by yourself and there's nobody else\n\n51:28.560 --> 51:33.720\ninvolved, and it's a simulation, that's one thing, but as soon as you involve an unwilling\n\n51:33.720 --> 51:38.280\nparticipant and that's why children, it's so difficult because we consider it after\n\n51:38.280 --> 51:43.280\nyounger than a certain age that they don't have the ability to comprehend the decision.\n\n51:43.280 --> 51:45.720\nI think it's a very easy line to draw.\n\n51:45.720 --> 51:50.520\nNo, no, no, she's saying it's difficult to allow for freedom of expression, freedom of\n\n51:50.520 --> 51:51.520\nchoice.\n\n51:51.520 --> 51:52.520\nWhen it comes to that.\n\n51:52.520 --> 51:53.520\nOn that surf.\n\n51:53.520 --> 51:54.520\nBecause the action...\n\n51:54.520 --> 51:58.960\nRight, because the action is suddenly inhibiting somebody else's freedom.\n\n51:58.960 --> 52:00.720\nAnd because the connection is between...\n\n52:00.720 --> 52:08.440\nYou're dealing with people who are easily victimizable, like you're talking about a person who is...\n\n52:08.440 --> 52:11.080\nWe're protecting this person for precisely the same reason.\n\n52:11.080 --> 52:15.920\nBefore there was an internet, you could prey on a saber-toothed tiger, could eat them more\n\n52:15.920 --> 52:16.920\nreadily.\n\n52:16.920 --> 52:19.840\nSo you're talking about, like, okay, when I...\n\n52:19.840 --> 52:21.560\nEveryone say your favorite ice cream flavor.\n\n52:21.560 --> 52:24.440\nI love to go to fuckafouryearold.com.\n\n52:24.440 --> 52:29.040\nWe can't just readily go, hey, have at it.\n\n52:29.040 --> 52:33.000\nThat's a terrible ice cream flavor.\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:37.840\nWe can't do that because we go, well, I cannot allow...\n\n52:37.840 --> 52:42.360\nLike Megan's Law was adopted because, like, there was a time...\n\n52:42.360 --> 52:43.360\nWhat is Megan's Law?\n\n52:43.360 --> 52:44.360\nMegan's Law is because...\n\n52:44.360 --> 52:50.360\nIn California is because there was a girl, like, she was, I don't know, something horrible\n\n52:50.360 --> 52:52.240\nhappened to her.\n\n52:52.240 --> 52:58.320\nAnd she basically lived across the street from a guy who was a sex offender who was registered,\n\n52:58.320 --> 53:00.320\nbut the registration was not...\n\n53:00.320 --> 53:01.320\nPublic.\n\n53:01.320 --> 53:02.320\nYeah.\n\n53:02.320 --> 53:03.320\nPublic.\n\n53:03.320 --> 53:08.320\nSo now that's why they have to go door to door and be like, listen, I have this weird\n\n53:08.320 --> 53:09.320\ncalendar.\n\n53:09.320 --> 53:10.320\nRight.\n\n53:10.320 --> 53:15.520\nI have the octopus in my neighbor's dog calendar.\n\n53:15.520 --> 53:16.520\nYeah.\n\n53:16.520 --> 53:17.520\nYeah.\n\n53:17.520 --> 53:18.520\nMay is my fave.\n\n53:18.520 --> 53:21.280\nSo stay away during that, Mike.\n\n53:21.280 --> 53:22.280\nAnd by the way...\n\n53:22.280 --> 53:23.280\nPicture really gets me going.\n\n53:23.280 --> 53:25.960\nAlong with everything else, there's another surf you've created now.\n\n53:25.960 --> 53:27.640\nThere's another beach.\n\n53:27.640 --> 53:34.760\nBecause there are people who water skied by there, you know, they got a little drunk\n\n53:34.760 --> 53:40.520\nand they water skied naked past a family at a beach picnic, you know, and they're registered.\n\n53:40.520 --> 53:41.520\nWell, that's...\n\n53:41.520 --> 53:42.520\nOkay, but that's...\n\n53:42.520 --> 53:43.520\nWell, that's different.\n\n53:43.520 --> 53:44.520\nBut what I'm saying...\n\n53:44.520 --> 53:45.520\nI'm not...\n\n53:45.520 --> 53:46.520\nIf you're giving them the credit...\n\n53:46.520 --> 53:47.520\nBut I'm not talking about creating policy.\n\n53:47.520 --> 53:53.320\nAll I'm saying is, like, every time you scout out like these, like, every time we pretend\n\n53:53.320 --> 53:57.120\nthat we know the difference between right and wrong, all we really create is more sand\n\n53:57.120 --> 54:00.040\nand more water, like another beach.\n\n54:00.040 --> 54:02.000\nI don't know the answers.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:03.000\nYeah.\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:04.000\nWell, I'm...\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:05.000\nSorry.\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:06.000\nGo ahead.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:07.000\nSorry.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:08.000\nGo ahead.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:09.000\nGo ahead.\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:10.000\nWhat I think a lot of what you're talking about is the difference between fantasy and having\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:11.760\nfantasies and acting on them.\n\n54:11.760 --> 54:14.520\nAnd I know, like, yeah, like, for myself...\n\n54:14.520 --> 54:15.520\nYou don't need...\n\n54:15.520 --> 54:16.520\nI mean, no one needs to applaud anything.\n\n54:16.520 --> 54:17.520\nNo.\n\n54:17.520 --> 54:18.520\nIt's just a thing.\n\n54:18.520 --> 54:21.880\nThis is the fucking hardest conversation I've ever had.\n\n54:21.880 --> 54:22.880\nThis is great.\n\n54:22.880 --> 54:23.880\nGood.\n\n54:23.880 --> 54:24.880\nNo, I know.\n\n54:24.880 --> 54:25.880\nI love it.\n\n54:25.880 --> 54:26.880\nI love it.\n\n54:26.880 --> 54:27.880\nCan I say one thing?\n\n54:27.880 --> 54:32.640\nI saw Breaking Bad tonight, and you guys all fucked up, probably, though.\n\n54:32.640 --> 54:33.640\nIt's great.\n\n54:33.640 --> 54:34.640\nGo ahead.\n\n54:34.640 --> 54:40.240\nWhen a lot of people know about the Kinsey Scale, obviously, but there's also...\n\n54:40.240 --> 54:43.840\nI forget what it's called, but there's also another scale of sexuality.\n\n54:43.840 --> 54:44.840\nThe Kinsey Scale?\n\n54:44.840 --> 54:45.840\nThank you very much.\n\n54:45.840 --> 54:46.840\nGood night.\n\n54:46.840 --> 54:47.840\nThank you.\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:48.840\nProfessional comedian.\n\n54:48.840 --> 54:49.840\nThank you very much.\n\n54:49.840 --> 54:50.840\nHe'll be here all week.\n\n54:50.840 --> 54:56.840\nBut it takes into account, there's like seven or eight, or 16, there's a whole bunch of categories,\n\n54:56.840 --> 55:04.120\nbut one of the main ones is fantasy, and you're allowed to have fantasies that you don't actually\n\n55:04.120 --> 55:12.360\nwant to act on, and I think that's where a lot of not only homophobia, but discrimination\n\n55:12.360 --> 55:16.520\nabout sex comes from is the shame from having a fantasy.\n\n55:16.520 --> 55:21.800\nAnd if I can get really real right now, and open up a little bit, but I personally, like\n\n55:21.800 --> 55:29.280\nI'm like a queer feminist, but I am like really, like I look at like hardcore, like violent\n\n55:29.280 --> 55:34.320\nporn on the internet, and like it's not something that I would ever want to do myself.\n\n55:34.320 --> 55:35.320\nViolent how?\n\n55:35.320 --> 55:41.720\nYou know, like describe it real slow.\n\n55:41.720 --> 55:43.960\nWhile I jerk off behind the control of podium.\n\n55:43.960 --> 55:45.960\nWell, listen, but in that...\n\n55:45.960 --> 55:49.000\nThis is why, by the way, that's why I have the podium, you guys.\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:53.880\nAnd I can get almost always got my dick in my hand up there.\n\n55:53.880 --> 55:56.720\nAnd it's also wearing a suit, go ahead.\n\n55:56.720 --> 56:04.560\nNo, I mean, just, you know, like S&M stuff that I don't have any interest in, but that\n\n56:04.560 --> 56:05.560\nis...\n\n56:05.560 --> 56:07.560\nYou have some interest in, you don't have interest in...\n\n56:07.560 --> 56:12.080\nInterest in doing it physically with my body, but my brain obviously is stimulated.\n\n56:12.080 --> 56:15.080\nWell, there's a huge factor there too.\n\n56:15.080 --> 56:16.880\nWe walk around with clothes on.\n\n56:16.880 --> 56:26.000\nWe, like I said, we have to, like 90% of our conscious lives, like we are in disguise.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.120\nWe are...\n\n56:28.120 --> 56:33.880\nOur sexuality is, and we're happy about it, otherwise it wouldn't exist.\n\n56:33.880 --> 56:34.880\nOh, sure.\n\n56:34.880 --> 56:38.760\nWe've certainly, we've revolted for less.\n\n56:38.760 --> 56:45.040\nIf the plebeians didn't want cardigans and underwear and shoes and things, like they\n\n56:45.040 --> 56:46.040\nwouldn't exist.\n\n56:46.040 --> 56:52.400\nWe're all pretty stoked about a certain fundamental wall between who we are as animals with our\n\n56:52.400 --> 56:57.920\nengorged privates and who we are, like walking around between orgasms.\n\n56:57.920 --> 57:00.520\nWell, the hardest thing has been...\n\n57:00.520 --> 57:07.000\nBut so because there's that fundamental wall, like there is that other factor where, you\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:15.080\nknow, people like things that are wrong, like that is a huge turn on.\n\n57:15.080 --> 57:18.680\nIt's like a battery, like there is what's right and there is what's wrong.\n\n57:18.680 --> 57:22.600\nYeah, like talking in an alley is awesome because of that.\n\n57:22.600 --> 57:23.600\nPublic sex.\n\n57:23.600 --> 57:24.600\nYeah.\n\n57:24.600 --> 57:25.600\nYou get on it.\n\n57:25.600 --> 57:26.600\nYeah.\n\n57:26.600 --> 57:29.560\nThe abuse in the bedroom between two consensual adults.\n\n57:29.560 --> 57:33.600\nLike, I mean, like you said that, you know, like people shitting on each other was wrong,\n\n57:33.600 --> 57:34.600\nbut the thing is, is like...\n\n57:34.600 --> 57:35.600\nBut he didn't.\n\n57:35.600 --> 57:36.600\nHe didn't say it's wrong.\n\n57:36.600 --> 57:37.600\nHe's saying we think it's weird.\n\n57:37.600 --> 57:42.200\nI'm still mad about the night that we started talking about pooping on each other and people\n\n57:42.200 --> 57:43.360\nwere too quick to...\n\n57:43.360 --> 57:44.360\nI think it's great.\n\n57:44.360 --> 57:45.360\nBut I mean...\n\n57:45.360 --> 57:48.320\nNo, if it's your thing, poop on each other.\n\n57:48.320 --> 57:50.480\nAnd if you both agree to it, like what's...\n\n57:50.480 --> 57:51.480\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n57:51.480 --> 57:52.480\nYeah.\n\n57:52.480 --> 57:53.480\nIf you found someone who did that...\n\n57:53.480 --> 57:54.480\nI mean, I don't want to wash the sheets when you're done.\n\n57:54.480 --> 57:56.480\nLet's not poop on each other, everybody.\n\n57:56.480 --> 57:57.480\nNo, no, no.\n\n57:57.480 --> 57:58.480\nBut if you want to...\n\n57:58.480 --> 57:59.480\nNo.\n\n57:59.480 --> 58:04.800\nI mean, like if you like poop, then fine, but let's seriously, fucking back to the drawing\n\n58:04.800 --> 58:05.800\nboard.\n\n58:05.800 --> 58:06.800\nAt least...\n\n58:06.800 --> 58:07.800\nNo, come on.\n\n58:07.800 --> 58:08.800\nI mean, I'm sticking to this.\n\n58:08.800 --> 58:09.800\nThat's terrible.\n\n58:09.800 --> 58:10.800\nWhy would you say that?\n\n58:10.800 --> 58:11.800\nI'm saying because I don't like the smell of poopies.\n\n58:11.800 --> 58:12.800\nBut you're not there.\n\n58:12.800 --> 58:14.800\nIt's not for you.\n\n58:14.800 --> 58:16.520\nIt's just you're trying to sell a couple in Santa Monica.\n\n58:16.520 --> 58:20.040\nBut if someone's listening right now going, I was on the fence about pooping on people,\n\n58:20.040 --> 58:22.360\nthen they're gonna push me on the poopy side.\n\n58:22.360 --> 58:23.360\nI'm not pushing you.\n\n58:23.360 --> 58:27.800\nIf you was on the fence about pooping, poopy sex, they're not on the fence about poopy\n\n58:27.800 --> 58:28.800\nsex.\n\n58:28.800 --> 58:29.800\nExactly.\n\n58:29.800 --> 58:30.800\nAnd they need to be pushed.\n\n58:30.800 --> 58:32.320\nSome people like you, Jeff.\n\n58:32.320 --> 58:37.480\nIf you're listening to me out there tonight, if you're listening to me, if you're listening\n\n58:37.480 --> 58:42.760\nas a couple and both of you look at each other right now, because I said there's such\n\n58:42.760 --> 58:46.600\na thing as being on the fence about poopy sex, Dan Harmon will come to your house and shit\n\n58:46.600 --> 58:47.600\non you right now.\n\n58:47.600 --> 58:48.600\nThat's the Dan Harmon character.\n\n58:48.600 --> 58:53.600\nGo into your bathroom right now and start involving poop in your sex and see what happens.\n\n58:53.600 --> 58:56.640\nEat the fucking kale and have the night of your lives.\n\n58:56.640 --> 58:59.640\nI'm really sorry I brought it up.\n\n58:59.640 --> 59:03.640\nBut I mean, what Lauren was saying is like, you know, with the wind and stuff like that.\n\n59:03.640 --> 59:04.640\nAre you Lauren?\n\n59:04.640 --> 59:05.640\nHi.\n\n59:05.640 --> 59:06.640\nNice to meet you.\n\n59:06.640 --> 59:11.240\nBut I mean, like there, but like, you know, when she's talking about like fantasy and\n\n59:11.240 --> 59:15.840\nmaking it real, it's like, you know, it's, you know, some people have, you know, they\n\n59:15.840 --> 59:16.840\nhave rape fantasies.\n\n59:16.840 --> 59:18.920\nThey have fantasies of being raped.\n\n59:18.920 --> 59:22.200\nBut the thing is, is that there's a difference between having a rape fantasy and having somebody\n\n59:22.200 --> 59:25.560\nthat can enact that with you that says yes.\n\n59:25.560 --> 59:26.560\nYeah.\n\n59:26.560 --> 59:27.560\nYeah.\n\n59:27.560 --> 59:28.560\nAnd safe for consent.\n\n59:28.560 --> 59:29.560\nYeah.\n\n59:29.560 --> 59:33.200\nIt's all about safe, sane, consensual that everybody is on the same page and everybody\n\n59:33.200 --> 59:34.720\nknows what's going on.\n\n59:34.720 --> 59:40.280\nAnd, and, you know, you look at like, like Jeffrey Dahmer, like he got off on dead men.\n\n59:40.280 --> 59:43.280\nAnd you know, we drew the line because he was killing people.\n\n59:43.280 --> 59:44.280\nYeah.\n\n59:44.280 --> 59:46.080\nMaybe just broken into a cemetery.\n\n59:46.080 --> 59:47.080\nYou'd be like, all right.\n\n59:47.080 --> 59:48.080\nI kind of see your point.\n\n59:48.080 --> 59:54.680\nWhat he was trying to do was actually he was trying to reanimate like dead bodies at a\n\n59:54.680 --> 59:57.520\ncertain point to the point where they were had slight function.\n\n59:57.520 --> 59:58.520\nReally?\n\n59:58.520 --> 59:59.520\nYes.\n\n59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.520\nYeah.\n\n01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.040\nNo, not with this, but he was actually like drilling holes in their heads and doing all\n\n01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040\nsorts of crazy shit.\n\n01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.440\nThat's why he was doing that as a Milwaukeean who was living a couple doors down from that\n\n01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.440\ngoing on.\n\n01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.440\nYeah.\n\n01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.440\nYeah.\n\n01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.440\nWait.\n\n01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.440\nAll the laws in the world didn't stop it from happening.\n\n01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.400\nIt's like as soon as, as soon as it was, you know, he would actually like kidnap these\n\n01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.200\nmen and then murder them to have sex with them.\n\n01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.200\nThat's the line.\n\n01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.400\nThat's the line is because these men aren't signing up to be murdered like that's the\n\n01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.400\nline.\n\n01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400\nThat's the line.\n\n01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400\nWe've defined it.\n\n01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.400\nWe figured it out.\n\n01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400\nThank you, Kelly.\n\n01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400\nKelly, everyone.\n\n01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400\nIsn't that a show you're on?\n\n01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400\nThat's the line.\n\n01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.400\nIs it anyway?\n\n01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400\nOh yeah.\n\n01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:45.640\nThere is no line, there is a beach, it is a surf, like, like we, that is the thing that\n\n01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.520\nwe have to get comfortable with.\n\n01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:54.200\nThere's no, there's no, there's no, there's no wall you can build.\n\n01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:59.400\nI thought like, like what, what legislation would you have adopted to prevent Jeffrey\n\n01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.440\nDahmer from eating 17?\n\n01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.280\nDon't kidnap people and murder them.\n\n01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.640\nThose laws have already been in existence.\n\n01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.040\nYeah, but he's outside the law just because he was able to get through it doesn't mean\n\n01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.040\nwe fucked up.\n\n01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:15.720\nSo we, we keep trying to make sure that there's this wall ideologically where anybody that\n\n01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.840\ndoes anything that's reprehensible to us so, so socially exists outside the wall.\n\n01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:27.320\nWe keep trying to make sure that our laws say that if you're doing something questionable,\n\n01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.760\nyou're on the other side of the wall.\n\n01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.160\nAnd I mean, that's, that's a ridiculous attempt.\n\n01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.920\nThen what do you propose?\n\n01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.760\nOh, shit.\n\n01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.600\nI propose we stop proposing.\n\n01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.840\nWell, that's not solving any problem.\n\n01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.680\nI didn't come here to solve any problem.\n\n01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.680\nYou're just shitting on people.\n\n01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.960\nYou're just shitting on them without them.\n\n01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.200\nI love shitting on people.\n\n01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.200\nIt makes me come.\n\n01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.200\nI knew it.\n\n01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.200\nI knew it.\n\n01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.800\nI want permission to shit on everybody.\n\n01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:59.800\nNo, I didn't, I didn't, see, that's the fucking God damn it, Spencer.\n\n01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.240\nI don't propose anything.\n\n01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.800\nThat doesn't mean I can't say something.\n\n01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.640\nLike you are, the walls are there, kicking them as healthy, pushing them down as healthy,\n\n01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.640\npunching holes in them as healthy.\n\n01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.800\nWell, depends on the walls that you're punching and kicking, the walls that imprison people\n\n01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800\nfor raping kids.\n\n01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800\nYeah.\n\n01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.800\nThe wall that's leaving out pedophiles is a good wall.\n\n01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:21.800\nOkay.\n\n01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.800\nDon't kick that shit.\n\n01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.800\nThat's not the wall.\n\n01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:24.800\nDon't kick, don't kick those walls.\n\n01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.800\nBut you know, there was a time where homosexuality, there was a wall between that.\n\n01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.480\nThat was a good wall to kick down.\n\n01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.480\nKick down that wall.\n\n01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.520\nBlack people, white people, marrying, that's a good wall to kick down.\n\n01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.600\nPedophilia, that's not a good wall to kick down.\n\n01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600\nAll right.\n\n01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.800\nWe've figured it out, then.\n\n01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.120\nEverybody here is existing comfortably within walls where we get to run everywhere we want\n\n01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120\nto run.\n\n01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.120\nWhat?\n\n01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.280\nNobody feels inappropriately limited in any way.\n\n01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.720\nI think it goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning with humanism and maybe\n\n01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.240\nwe should just like pay more attention to each other and like.\n\n01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.560\nMaybe this wall building system, maybe this idea that walls are a thing, like maybe that's\n\n01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.560\nthe problem.\n\n01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.560\nMaybe, maybe.\n\n01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.760\nWhat about the murder wall?\n\n01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.520\nI just, if you think it's such a bad idea, I'll kill you all right now.\n\n01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.080\nAre you, are you going to kill us?\n\n01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080\nI'm saying, if.\n\n01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.600\nAre you going to kill me if I lower that wall?\n\n01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600\nIf.\n\n01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.600\nYou're not going to kill us.\n\n01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.600\nThere's no police here.\n\n01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600\nThere's nothing to prevent you from killing me.\n\n01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.600\nYeah, but he won't, but somebody else will.\n\n01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.600\nYou know, no one will.\n\n01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600\nYeah, they will.\n\n01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600\nNo one will kill me.\n\n01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600\nYeah, they won't.\n\n01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.920\nAnyone that wants to kill me, come up and kill me.\n\n01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.920\nNo, that's the wall.\n\n01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.680\nAnyone come up and kill me.\n\n01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.960\nI give you permission to come kill me.\n\n01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.960\nThere's no wall.\n\n01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.040\nThere's no wall preventing you from killing me.\n\n01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.040\nThere is.\n\n01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.200\nIf you say come kill me and he comes kills you, that guy is fucked forever.\n\n01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.840\nYou think that's why he's not killing me?\n\n01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.760\nNo, no, but there is someone that would kill you.\n\n01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.080\nThat's why you're not killing me because you don't want to go to jail.\n\n01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.360\nNo, no, but there is someone who's not killing you for that reason.\n\n01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.360\nIt's not this guy.\n\n01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.040\nThere's someone who's not fucking kids for that reason, like otherwise they would, and\n\n01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.040\nit's not anyone here.\n\n01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:01.640\nWe are building walls too closely to where we live to keep people that we think are out\n\n01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.640\nthere.\n\n01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.640\nWhat about the wall and Game of Thrones?\n\n01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.640\nWe need that one, right?\n\n01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.640\nYeah, get some crows.\n\n01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.880\nThat one is absolutely necessary.\n\n01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.880\nWe need that one.\n\n01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880\nNo, actually, no.\n\n01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.880\nGod damn it.\n\n01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.880\nNo.\n\n01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:12.880\nSee, I got you.\n\n01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.080\nThe whole point of Game of Thrones is you find out that that wall shouldn't be there.\n\n01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.080\nNo, it means the wall should be taller.\n\n01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.080\nThe wildlings aren't helping everybody.\n\n01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.680\nYeah, the taller wall.\n\n01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.200\nThe wall keeps out the dead ice zombies, man.\n\n01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.200\nThe ice zombies, yeah.\n\n01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.680\nThe ice zombies are fucking kids, dudes.\n\n01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.720\nThe ice zombies are...\n\n01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.640\nCan we talk about the morality of having me come up on stage to eject someone else from\n\n01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.800\nthe stage?\n\n01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.800\nThat was just defense.\n\n01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.800\nThat felt really...\n\n01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.800\nI felt really used at that time.\n\n01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.880\nI felt violated.\n\n01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.200\nI felt that there's a line between...\n\n01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.080\nWe thought that he was being ejected from the stage and he went over and took your seat,\n\n01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.360\nwhich I thought is a seat of honor.\n\n01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.160\nI think of that seat as being your throne over there.\n\n01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.160\nYeah, that's not some...\n\n01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.000\nI just felt used.\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.520\nI wouldn't sit in your seat because I would feel like I was usurping a throne.\n\n01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.520\nI'd sit in your seat.\n\n01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.400\nI'll shit all over you, man.\n\n01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.480\nLet's all thank Lauren for coming up and saying...\n\n01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.480\nThank you, Lauren.\n\n01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.400\nThank you, Lauren.\n\n01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:20.080\nI mean, look, somebody walks into the middle of a field and starts asking the question,\n\n01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.360\nwhy do we hate pedophiles?\n\n01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:27.840\nAnd 48 minutes later, we're yelling at each other.\n\n01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:33.760\nI'm saying, it's a great episode.\n\n01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.440\nI'm saying, I think that our whole...\n\n01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.880\nWe need to evolve as people beyond a certain point.\n\n01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.760\nThat system of thinking, when someone challenges you, when someone comes up to you and says,\n\n01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.640\nhey, are you...\n\n01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:55.560\nYou brought up the fact that black people who had this culture going on, all of a sudden,\n\n01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.840\nthis shit started rolling downhill.\n\n01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.240\nThis system of walls was a big part of that.\n\n01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.680\nThere was a huge Muslim rap movement going on before 9-11.\n\n01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.680\nSure.\n\n01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:11.880\nIt just went into the drawers really fast, like 9-11 happened, and then it was like,\n\n01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.880\nzip, mums the word.\n\n01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880\nSure.\n\n01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:21.280\nBut I mean, I think for society to exist and to have people who are, who have bad brains\n\n01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.320\nfrom ruining society, we have to have these walls.\n\n01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.920\nI mean, what are you saying that we just have no laws and we just walk around, do whatever\n\n01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.720\nwe want and hope that everyone makes the right decisions?\n\n01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:37.560\nBut we don't have any walls between us and the kinds of people that build walls.\n\n01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:38.560\nWe have a new entry.\n\n01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.560\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:40.560\nHello, Laura.\n\n01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:41.560\nGrab the mic over there.\n\n01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.560\nFuck it.\n\n01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.560\nLet's do it.\n\n01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.560\nThis is the Lawrence seat.\n\n01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.560\nIt's the Laura Lawrence seat, yeah.\n\n01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.560\nNo, I was just going to talk about this.\n\n01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.560\nWe were talking about pedophiles and undesirables, but we didn't really talk about better living\n\n01:06:47.560 --> 01:07:01.080\nthrough chemistry with chemical castration because it's like people agree that pedophiles\n\n01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.080\nshould be put in prison.\n\n01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.080\nAnd some of them beg to be castrated.\n\n01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:08.920\nSome of them do, or chemically castrate or castrate, do we believe in better living through\n\n01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.760\nchemistry with taking these people and making them unable to do all of this?\n\n01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.360\nWe do it to our pets.\n\n01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.800\nMy girlfriend started crying the other night because Harvey's coming up on his day.\n\n01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:20.960\nYeah, it's tough.\n\n01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.560\nI've had a million pets castrated, Spade.\n\n01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.640\nYour pets, they're just like pedophiles.\n\n01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.440\nI mean, they are.\n\n01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.440\nThat's where the word comes from.\n\n01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.440\nThey are.\n\n01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.080\nIn the sense that they are.\n\n01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.840\nIf you read any book about pet care, it says like, in case you're feeling bad about neutering\n\n01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:42.400\nyour dog, it puts you at ease and says, you know what, like, I know that to human beings,\n\n01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:48.000\nthis is a very valuable asset, but to the animals that we've domesticated, it's a source\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.400\nof frustration and, you know, it presents them with urges that they cannot say shit.\n\n01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.720\nAnd it causes them pain.\n\n01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.640\nThere's a reason for them.\n\n01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.640\nIt's better for them.\n\n01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.160\nIf they were to speak, they would thank you.\n\n01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.160\nAnd I believe it kind of.\n\n01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.880\nBut do you agree that that's a way to deal with pets?\n\n01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.440\nIs that more humane to deal with pedophiles than just put them in jail?\n\n01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.760\nDo we agree that as a society, as an adult in America, that if you have certain desirable\n\n01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.800\nurges that we don't like, then we can just mangle your junk or we can like cut it out?\n\n01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.000\nI don't know, but I do think it's weird that we have more, we consider it more sacred what\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.480\ngoes on up in this bowl of pudding at the top of your neck than we do with the, this\n\n01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.600\nmess between your legs.\n\n01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.320\nIf you, and I don't know what the research is scientifically.\n\n01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.720\nCan we call it a chocolate mousse in our legs?\n\n01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.920\nIf you castrate a, if you castrate a pedophile, do they just, they just, you call your dick\n\n01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.120\nyour chocolate mousse?\n\n01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:44.120\nWell, weirdly, this is so much TMI.\n\n01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.120\nMy dick is maybe five shades darker than the rest of me.\n\n01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.720\nSo I do call it my chocolate mousse.\n\n01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.520\nWhere's that clapping coming from?\n\n01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.520\nThat's my wife clapping back there.\n\n01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.120\nNo, it's not Dustin.\n\n01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120\nNo, it's my wife.\n\n01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.120\nOh, it's not Dustin.\n\n01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120\nShe knows.\n\n01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.120\nDustin doesn't know.\n\n01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.680\nBut a lot of states in the south, during the fifties and sixties, they find records\n\n01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:13.920\nthat they sterilize people, that they thought, you know, we're poor, people go to prison\n\n01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.920\nand they get sterilized.\n\n01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:15.920\nWell, that's bad.\n\n01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.920\nThere's been movements about that too.\n\n01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.200\nIf you're, if you're poor and you're having a kid, like, oh, this is just going to be\n\n01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.200\na welfare baby.\n\n01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.120\nThere's been, there's been, there's been Joan of Arc's in that movement who have been\n\n01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.120\nalternatively celebrated.\n\n01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:30.720\nI predict there's going to be no Joan of Arc in the pedophilia movement.\n\n01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.680\nI don't think there's going to be someone who are like, oh, it turns out they were\n\n01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.680\nright.\n\n01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.680\nOkay.\n\n01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.680\nSo let's move forward from that.\n\n01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.600\nSo let's say, let's castrate them.\n\n01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:45.400\nSo when you are, I'm not saying that that for me is a weird line, but you want to solve\n\n01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:46.400\na problem.\n\n01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400\nDon't you?\n\n01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.400\nYeah.\n\n01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.400\nPut them away.\n\n01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:50.400\nOr put them away.\n\n01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.400\nHow is that better?\n\n01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.400\nIs it better to have them getting hard and jail thinking about kids or to just be out in\n\n01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.040\nthe world not thinking about kids?\n\n01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.680\nWell, if they want it, but for me, it's me, something doing, doing something to their\n\n01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:05.880\nbody specifically, uh, against their will, they're putting their body in a cell against\n\n01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.880\ntheir will.\n\n01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.880\nYeah.\n\n01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880\nCause they're fucking kids, dude.\n\n01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880\nYeah.\n\n01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880\nFor me, that's, that's the problem.\n\n01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.960\nUh, you know what the rules are, how long are you going to put them away for the criminal\n\n01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.760\njustice that we, we, uh, that we punish people, but we don't give any money or any, any energy\n\n01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.760\nto actual rehabilitation.\n\n01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.760\nLike, yeah.\n\n01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:24.120\nWhy not kill them, why not give you the gun, let you, let you put a bullet in the back\n\n01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.120\nof your head.\n\n01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.720\nWe throw people and lock them up for all these different crimes for drug possession and for,\n\n01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.680\nfor, uh, for rape and for all these disparate crimes and stuff like that, but we don't,\n\n01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.240\nwe don't have the time or the, or the will because again, like it's, it's not the reciprocity\n\n01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.240\nthing.\n\n01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.480\nThere's no, there's no profit in making a bad person into a good person.\n\n01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:42.280\nAnd the thing is, uh, in a lot of cases, there's no profit in the reasons to do it.\n\n01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.280\nThere is no profit in the reasons to do it.\n\n01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.280\nWell, there is.\n\n01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.120\nIn some cases, in some cases you're going to deal and I think that's, I think in minimal\n\n01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.960\ncases you're going to deal with people that are unfixable because of the, the, the, the,\n\n01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:56.800\nthe glob of toothpaste inside their cranium, uh, there's just, just, just wiring that goes\n\n01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.320\nwrong and it's bad things that happen to the human brain and it's complex as shit.\n\n01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:05.560\nUm, we should deal with every problem, the pothole on the street in front of our house\n\n01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.760\nto, to, to, uh, to somebody being sick and having a runny nose to everything.\n\n01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.680\nWe should deal with it as communities with compassion as opposed to throwing it away\n\n01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:20.040\nto these, like just giving it to, uh, to, uh, the government and to things and say,\n\n01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:24.320\ndraw lines, draw big, hard lines in the sand and so we can just push things over these\n\n01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.160\nwalls and, and forget about them.\n\n01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.000\nUh, the hardest thing in the world to do was, it would be to actually care for each other,\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.640\nto actually be responsible for ourselves, for our parents, for our kids and not just\n\n01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.160\nthrow them into the street and, and, and like, you know, we, we, we don't have any responsibility\n\n01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.160\nfor our lives.\n\n01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.080\nAnd if your neighbor is a pedophile, you should be going down to their house and actually\n\n01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.440\nyou should castrate them.\n\n01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.640\nYou should be the one to castrate them.\n\n01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:47.640\nOne on one.\n\n01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.240\nBring, bring up a nice pie.\n\n01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.240\nIt's like filling a pothole.\n\n01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:58.400\nWith broken dicks, uh, we should fill potholes with broken dicks.\n\n01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:03.080\nI'm not saying that we should go cut their penises off, but I am saying we should separate\n\n01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.480\nthem from situations where they can fuck children.\n\n01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.080\nI feel like that's a very same thing for me.\n\n01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:14.720\nI am saying, I'm saying if the, if, if the proposal is that there be proposals, if the\n\n01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:21.360\nidea is that there needs to be solutions, then the problem is that there is, I don't,\n\n01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:26.720\nI don't think that putting someone in a, in a four foot cell, uh, because it stops them\n\n01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.040\nfrom fucking children.\n\n01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.400\nThey don't stay in there though.\n\n01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.560\nNo, but when they come, do you want to keep someone in there until they die and then just\n\n01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:40.160\nkill them or acknowledge that you are determining that sex, their sexuality is, and castrate\n\n01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160\nthem.\n\n01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.160\nA lot of them.\n\n01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.320\nCommunity is, community is like, if they ask for it, great, what do you want?\n\n01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:49.760\nSo we wait for them to ask for it and until they do, we put them in a cell and we wait,\n\n01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:55.200\nwe keep asking them, we hold up a picture of a child and we go, do you have a boner?\n\n01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.520\nAnd if they say yes, then we leave them in there.\n\n01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.600\nOr if they say, if you have a picture of a, uh, if you have a boner promise you won't\n\n01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.160\ndo anything when you get out and if you can believe that, then let them out.\n\n01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:12.560\nBut if, if there's someone, I, this is, if, if someone you think is going to rape children\n\n01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.600\nwhen you put them out there, walls are a very good thing to have, putting them away from\n\n01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.800\nsituations where they will go fuck children.\n\n01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.400\nI just don't know if the walls are built.\n\n01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.560\nI mean, I, I think walls are fantastic.\n\n01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:28.280\nI, I, I have four of them of my own cheap out people that I don't like, but a lot of\n\n01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.960\nthose people are people that build walls.\n\n01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.520\nYou're never going to build a wall that keeps murder from happening or keeps rape from happening.\n\n01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.360\nBut we can keep trying, right?\n\n01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:40.000\nIsn't it, isn't it the point to not have murders or rapes happen, that's what we're trying\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nto do.\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.600\nI think though that like there's, there's a way to deal with like problems like this\n\n01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:50.920\nwith criminality and, and, and with, uh, antisocial behavior is to look at the actual, like look\n\n01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.960\nat the humanity behind what's going on.\n\n01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.960\nSure.\n\n01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:57.960\nJust cause I understand, just cause I see that a pedophile wants to fuck kids doesn't\n\n01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.400\nmean he's any less of a criminal.\n\n01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.320\nI think it should be dealt with within, I mean, I think everything should be dealt with\n\n01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.880\nwithin the actual communities themselves.\n\n01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:11.240\nThere was a story of a rapist that got paroled and let out and that the community took it\n\n01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.240\nupon themselves.\n\n01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.480\nThis is before the laws that you had to go and form the town.\n\n01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:20.040\nThey said, if they put pictures of this guy everywhere and they said, if you see him,\n\n01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.600\ndo not lend him any services or any goods or anything.\n\n01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.600\nYeah, but that's one.\n\n01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.800\nAnd the guy basically was just outcast and he actually came back and like, I'm sorry,\n\n01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.160\nI, I, I can't survive like this.\n\n01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160\nYeah.\n\n01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.400\nBut that's one society in Pakistan where I'm from, all these villages have their own\n\n01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.400\nrules.\n\n01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.040\nAnd if a woman marries the wrong person, they're like, all right, let's just kill this guy.\n\n01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.040\nIn practice, those things don't work.\n\n01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.960\nThey just kill people.\n\n01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:47.360\nLike you have to have these sort of rules that we've all agreed on, right?\n\n01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:50.920\nLike that one situation that works, but it doesn't work in Pakistan.\n\n01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.320\nI think societies go through enlightenment and they go through dark ages.\n\n01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.640\nAnd I don't know if we're heading towards one or the other right now, but there's times\n\n01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.480\nwhen like, I think we go through thresholds of enlightenment where people actually like\n\n01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.320\nstep up and go, okay, compassion is the new rule now.\n\n01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.520\nThen we head towards really dark ages and things like that.\n\n01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.520\nYeah.\n\n01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.080\nI mean, are we going to like, let's call a spade a spade.\n\n01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:18.960\nAre we are, is, is America, despite our self deprecation, self loathing, our, our, this\n\n01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.880\nacknowledgement of the fact that we're on the economic downslide and that the empire\n\n01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.240\nhas fallen, are we top of the line or not?\n\n01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.360\nIs it our responsibility to be the most socially progressive or not?\n\n01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.360\nOkay.\n\n01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.840\nWell, then let's, let's let it all back down into what works.\n\n01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.920\nNo, it is, but we aren't.\n\n01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.400\nWe aren't the most socially progressive.\n\n01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.400\nOkay.\n\n01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.400\nYeah.\n\n01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.400\nIt's great.\n\n01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.400\nIt's very fashionable to say that.\n\n01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400\nBut are we really aren't?\n\n01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.400\nOkay.\n\n01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.400\nWe really are not.\n\n01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.240\nThen let's not, then let's not make it our business to be so let's, let's, let's pull\n\n01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.480\nback into what's functional.\n\n01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.480\nWhat?\n\n01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.480\nThat's what America does best.\n\n01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.480\nWhat?\n\n01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.480\nLet's be isolationist.\n\n01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.480\nWhat?\n\n01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.200\nAre you, that's like saying, I'm not the skinniest guy.\n\n01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.760\nSo I've never going to go on a diet.\n\n01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.760\nLike that's crazy.\n\n01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.320\nSweden's like super progressive, but that doesn't mean we can't try to like have better\n\n01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.320\nwifi.\n\n01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320\nThat's right.\n\n01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.120\nBut if you, if you're spending money on a gym membership that you never use, can you\n\n01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:13.120\ninstead say, I'll cancel that gym membership and I'll just try to eat more fruits and vegetables.\n\n01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:18.400\nI don't subscribe to that example, but I'll do something.\n\n01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.760\nYou look at the more economically advantageous route that you don't just keep throwing money\n\n01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.560\nat a thing that clearly is not working.\n\n01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.240\nFor us, we could say economically to keep putting money into therapy for pedophiles\n\n01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.240\nthat doesn't work.\n\n01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.840\nIt doesn't keep anyone from fucking kids.\n\n01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:35.080\nWe could instead say, let's try to get kids off drugs or whatever and say, like, that's\n\n01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.080\nnot working.\n\n01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.440\nLet's just castrate them all or put them all in prison.\n\n01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.120\nAnd what does Sweden do with their pedophiles?\n\n01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.240\nDo they give them free wifi?\n\n01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.720\nAnd what does, what does Sweden do?\n\n01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.920\nWhat does Sweden do with non-Swedish people?\n\n01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.920\nYou know, there's Europe.\n\n01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.080\nDo they do anything with them?\n\n01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.200\nThere's European prisons that are like actually designed for rehabilitation and they give people\n\n01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.200\na lot of freedom.\n\n01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.640\nThey, like, put them on an island and say, oh, here you could grow your own food.\n\n01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.640\nHere's a little farm.\n\n01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.520\nThat's what, yeah, that's what I want.\n\n01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:07.760\nOur prison system needs to be an island where capitalism is an option, but not required.\n\n01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.160\nAustralia.\n\n01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:19.120\nWe need to, we need to, the big problem with prison is that the big joke is like, you're\n\n01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.120\nnot, that's just punishment.\n\n01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.160\nWell, the joke is the profit because in America, you make money by having prison.\n\n01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.160\nYeah.\n\n01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.440\nLike you have prisoners and you get, Pete, the government gives you the person money.\n\n01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.440\nYeah.\n\n01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.440\nYou have this free labor force and it's insane.\n\n01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.440\nAnd you're like incentivized.\n\n01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.440\nNo one's getting rehabilitated.\n\n01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.440\nYou're only getting to be a better criminal now.\n\n01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.640\nI'm for rehab prison.\n\n01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.640\nI'm totally for that.\n\n01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640\nI think, you know, I'm not saying that.\n\n01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.640\nBut nobody else is.\n\n01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:39.640\nOkay.\n\n01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.640\nSo let's rehab a pedophile.\n\n01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.640\nWhat?\n\n01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640\nIn prison.\n\n01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.640\nCan you?\n\n01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.640\nIf you can.\n\n01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.640\nNo, you can't.\n\n01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.640\nYou can rehab self pedophiles.\n\n01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.640\nWhat do you, what do you want us to do with them?\n\n01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.640\nWe're not proposing things that have anything to do with the system we have.\n\n01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.640\nYou just want a whole lot of progress.\n\n01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:56.640\nBy the way, the reason why I brought this subject up is not because I love pedophilia.\n\n01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.040\nNo, I understand.\n\n01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.320\nI understand that.\n\n01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:04.180\nIt's because I think that our system is like, like there, you can go to the dark corners\n\n01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:09.480\nand realize that we are not equipped for the fucking hellfire that's to come.\n\n01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.640\nLike we are, we are every fucking day.\n\n01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:17.280\nWe are moving further and further into this surf where the walls aren't going to work\n\n01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.280\nanymore.\n\n01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.280\nThey're not going to work.\n\n01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:23.800\nThe, the Canadians are able to argue that my show is a bad show.\n\n01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.000\nThey don't, they don't matter on the Nielsen's.\n\n01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.240\nThat's the first sign of the apocalypse that I have to talk to a Canadian on Reddit and\n\n01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:36.960\ngo, well, if you think about it, maybe community was funny last night.\n\n01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.360\nIt's only going to get worse.\n\n01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.760\nIt's only going to get worse.\n\n01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.480\nI can't tell sometimes, Dan, I'm not trying to be provocative.\n\n01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.440\nI can't tell like right now, like honestly, like whether you're on the side of walls or\n\n01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.440\nnot.\n\n01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.440\nLike-\n\n01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.440\nHe's, he's against walls.\n\n01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.280\nI know that you're against walls, but you, you do live within a certain sort of-\n\n01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.440\nI'm on the side of an audit into the masonry division.\n\n01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:03.880\nI would like to know what goes into the construction of walls and who's walling in the wall makers.\n\n01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.400\nWe necessitate walls because we don't want any personal responsibility for anything we\n\n01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.400\ndo.\n\n01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.900\nWe, we give it to other people to build walls around our cities, around our ideas.\n\n01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.560\nYou don't want some of these people out there deciding their own morality.\n\n01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.440\nYou don't want these people out there deciding what's right or wrong, right?\n\n01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:22.280\nYou don't want like a crazy person being like, in my head, it makes sense to fuck kids and\n\n01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.640\nthen kill this guy.\n\n01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.760\nIt doesn't make sense for that to be, you have to have these walls.\n\n01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.760\nI agree.\n\n01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:33.480\nI would like to know for instance why I can't have this conversation without all of us trying\n\n01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:37.720\nto build walls around each other and figure out where the right and wrong place to put\n\n01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.720\nbricks is.\n\n01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:44.400\nI would like to know why this conversation can't happen without everyone starting to\n\n01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.000\nassert the right and wrong of it.\n\n01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.280\nYou and I both agree because we talk about this a lot, that the ideal society would be\n\n01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:57.120\none where there was a fluid conversation between communities and between people and no hierarchy\n\n01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:02.480\njust based on an exchange of ideas and that would be women and men and queers and everybody\n\n01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:07.040\nlike doing cool shit and that would be great but the problem is the education isn't there.\n\n01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:11.480\nYou have to go through decades and generations of education to get people to have a fucking\n\n01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:16.160\n– kids in a sand lot aren't racist, they're not fucking – they're not gross, they're\n\n01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:22.680\nnot – problems get dealt with really kind of quickly and very organically.\n\n01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.720\nFor adults to do that now, you'd have to go through decades of education.\n\n01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.720\nWell, that's why we're leaving for sure.\n\n01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:30.440\nYou don't make seven billion people start doing something different.\n\n01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.440\nYou can't now.\n\n01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:35.320\nThe bummer, as I mean, oh, she's sleeping, Laura.\n\n01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.360\nWe've actually just traded more.\n\n01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:40.280\nLet me finish my thought.\n\n01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:44.840\nThe idea now, the bummer, as I am going to turn 40 in a week – 30 in a week.\n\n01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.840\nJesus.\n\n01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.840\nI'm trying.\n\n01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:47.840\nI'm trying.\n\n01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:48.840\nThat's hard living, man.\n\n01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.960\nI'm turning 40 in a week.\n\n01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.120\nYou lose a little bit of your idealism and the sad thing is the idea that what I thought\n\n01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.560\nwas possible when I was 19 and reading all this stuff and thinking the idea that it's\n\n01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:05.640\npossible to live communally, it's possible to have liberty and actually live for the\n\n01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:11.280\npeople around you, actually be the good version of socialists and the good version of libertarian\n\n01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.440\nand be like a free society, you think, oh, it's happened.\n\n01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:19.800\nWe were close a few times throughout the last few hundred years.\n\n01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:24.840\nAs you get older, which is a bummer, and I'm not trying to talk people into this, I hate\n\n01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.200\nthe fact that I don't think you can fucking do it anymore.\n\n01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.080\nI don't think that we're – that we are involved in that.\n\n01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:34.040\nOh, no, I mean certainly the only one that's ever done this technology comes in as we allow\n\n01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:39.440\nthis technology and our funds and we sacrifice liberty so willfully because it's great.\n\n01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:43.840\nIt's so fucking awesome to just touch your phone and you have access to everything and\n\n01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.040\nyou don't have to learn or gain any knowledge.\n\n01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.160\nYou don't have to go through anything to learn anything.\n\n01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.380\nYou mean as you get closer to the dirt.\n\n01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:56.040\nYou mean as you get closer to the grave than you are from the vagina.\n\n01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:00.320\nThat's why 20-year-olds are co-opted into these educational labyrinths and into the\n\n01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.320\nmilitary.\n\n01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:06.640\nThat's why they are told to direct their passion, which is inherent to them, into\n\n01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.520\nfighting for the tribe instead of fighting against it.\n\n01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.840\nThey threaten us.\n\n01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.920\nWe use them to kill each other when we go to war.\n\n01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.800\nWe use them.\n\n01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.680\nWe fear them.\n\n01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:25.200\nWe give birth to them and when they are teenagers, a 17-year-old person is so filled with so\n\n01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.000\nmuch energy and so unafraid of death because they don't realize it's an inevitability that\n\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.760\nthey actually have a capacity for idealism.\n\n01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:36.280\nThey have the capacity for change and we use them to build walls.\n\n01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:40.160\nWe use them to move cargo containers and we tell them, go off.\n\n01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:43.120\nHey, Iraq, you should go fight them.\n\n01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.880\nWe tell them that they're full of shit and we live in fear of them as we creep into the\n\n01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.880\ngrave.\n\n01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:49.880\nI absolutely agree with you.\n\n01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:54.200\nAt 40-years-old, I'm so glad I have toilet paper that's three-ply instead of two-ply.\n\n01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.440\nI can't believe I ever lived through two-ply.\n\n01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.800\nI can't believe I ever had to change my own light bulb.\n\n01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.120\nI can't believe I didn't know what dark chocolate was and how much better it was than milk chocolate.\n\n01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.800\nI can't believe breaking bad was so good this season.\n\n01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:09.720\nI'm so happy that I'm not going to get hurt before I die.\n\n01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:14.280\nI hope to God they stick a tube down my throat and they just take me out.\n\n01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.640\nBut revolution doesn't come in a voting booth.\n\n01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:22.480\nIt doesn't happen within the worlds that we create for these kids.\n\n01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.240\nWe build walls around them and we tell them the difference between left and right.\n\n01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.480\nWe tell them that if your belly button is pierced, you're liberal and we tell them that\n\n01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:35.560\nif you have a flag in your window, you're conservative and it's all horseshit because\n\n01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:41.440\nthere's worlds beyond those fucking walls and yes, if you break down those walls, you\n\n01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:46.520\nmight end up knowing a pedophile and actually forgiving them that maybe that was my point\n\n01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:51.680\nthe whole time, that we build these fucking walls that are so convenient for us because\n\n01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:56.640\nthere's people standing on them that say, if you go beyond this point, you forgive the\n\n01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.520\nidea of fucking a three-year-old.\n\n01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.360\nThere's other things back there.\n\n01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.960\nThere's hidden packages.\n\n01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.120\nThere's bonus levels.\n\n01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:09.400\nThere's shit outside the rectangle that we create around ourselves.\n\n01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.640\nWe employ these people like you said.\n\n01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.040\nWe wake up in the morning and we go like, oh man, I hope the cop keeps me safe.\n\n01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.000\nI don't want a dude crawling in my window.\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.320\nI got a girlfriend in here.\n\n01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.720\nI got a breaking bad party tonight.\n\n01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:23.880\nI don't want some dudes coming in and deciding to break bad.\n\n01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:27.560\nAnd those cops out there are going like, man, I'll protect that house.\n\n01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.560\nFuck an A, man.\n\n01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.920\nI don't want some dude crawling in there.\n\n01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.920\nI got my salary.\n\n01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.920\nI want to make lieutenant.\n\n01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.960\nI want to do whatever the hell that motivates them.\n\n01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.960\nI only learned about police from Breaking Bad.\n\n01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:43.840\nIt all goes down, but it's working.\n\n01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.440\nIt's working fantastic.\n\n01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:46.440\nIt's working great.\n\n01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.840\nIt works so well.\n\n01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.680\nLife is so safe and so easy.\n\n01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:56.240\nEven if you have it kind of bad, even if you're having, you're broke and you're indigent\n\n01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:00.240\nand you have no direction, life is so comfortable and so safe.\n\n01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.200\nIt's like in certain countries, not in all of us.\n\n01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.200\nJust here.\n\n01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.200\nYeah, just here.\n\n01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.200\nOr like 10 countries.\n\n01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.200\nBut in our world.\n\n01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.960\nBut then you watch, like every time I fucking turn the television on, there's some guy that's\n\n01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.640\nshot up a fucking supermarket or a school.\n\n01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.000\nOr like a school of sleeping children.\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nRight.\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nThat happened today.\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nThere's a wall.\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nThat happened today.\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nWhere was it?\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000\nNigeria.\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.960\nAnd there's a wall that says you shouldn't do that.\n\n01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.960\nAnd that's a good wall.\n\n01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.960\nThat's a good wall.\n\n01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.960\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.800\nBut now life is so simple.\n\n01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:37.160\nI think people have always had neuroses and people have always been freaky and sad.\n\n01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.320\nNow there's more of us, first of all.\n\n01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.000\nSecond of all, we know everything that happens because there's cameras everywhere, so we see\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nit all happen.\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nWe can all watch it happen.\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.280\nWe're also interconnected with each other that we're all more aware of it.\n\n01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.160\nNow people talk about things more, rape is more talked about because people come forward\n\n01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.160\nmore about it now.\n\n01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.480\nIt's always been happening, but now it's a lot.\n\n01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:58.720\nNFL players have always been doing drugs and always been assholes.\n\n01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.280\nNow they're always on TV more because we care about it more.\n\n01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.920\nThat's our big fucking fetish now.\n\n01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:07.240\nLife is so fucking easy that revolution now is people going, I don't like my life.\n\n01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.880\nI'm going to go out on TV.\n\n01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.760\nI'm going to go out with my name on the fucking CNN for 38 hours of a guy that did this fucking\n\n01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.520\nhorrible atrocity.\n\n01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.520\nWe can't build walls.\n\n01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.360\nThere's no such thing as a wall that will keep that out.\n\n01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:25.640\nThere never has been a wall that keeps that guy out, but that doesn't mean we don't build\n\n01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:26.640\nit.\n\n01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.240\nI think the wall is a bad metaphor.\n\n01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:29.240\nThere's no physical thing or separate.\n\n01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.240\nThe wall is a bad metaphor.\n\n01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.160\nIt's like there isn't a wall.\n\n01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.920\nThere's simple rights and wrongs and we all have to agree on them and disagree on them\n\n01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:37.040\nall the time.\n\n01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.440\nAnd I think we do agree on them.\n\n01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.640\nI think the first thing you have to do is address the fact that, like you say, there\n\n01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:46.480\nis a mysterious, I've talked to a great, I think we all agree the wall is a bad metaphor.\n\n01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:51.160\nBecause there's no such thing as a physical wall that has ever kept any of the shit from\n\n01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:52.160\nhappening.\n\n01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.160\nAnd there never will be.\n\n01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.160\nThere never will be.\n\n01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.840\nBut I think we think in our heads that if we build enough walls in the right places\n\n01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.640\nthat it will stop happening, the wall is a bad metaphor.\n\n01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:05.640\nThere is no such thing as a wall that will stop any of it from happening.\n\n01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:09.320\nNo wall stopped Jeffrey Dahmer from scooping a dead squirrel out from his crawl space and\n\n01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.320\ngoing, run.\n\n01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.320\nThat's interesting.\n\n01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:15.000\nI think I'll make 17 people be my human zombies.\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.880\nThere was no wall that kept him from doing that.\n\n01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.640\nYeah, but that doesn't mean he's wrong.\n\n01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.520\nThe wall is a bad paradigm.\n\n01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.520\nOkay.\n\n01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.040\nThe wall is the difference between right and wrong, right?\n\n01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.600\nIt's the difference between right and wrong.\n\n01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.600\nThat's what we're talking about.\n\n01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.600\nBoundaries.\n\n01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.600\nWe're not talking about the wall.\n\n01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:31.600\nThe boundary.\n\n01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.600\nIt's right and wrong.\n\n01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:37.160\nBy the way, who's changing your light bulbs for you?\n\n01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:40.720\nI wish Erin was here right now because she just literally got electrocuted yesterday.\n\n01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:41.720\nLet's bring her up.\n\n01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.720\nOh, she's not here.\n\n01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:43.720\nShe's not here.\n\n01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:44.720\nOh, shit.\n\n01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.720\nWho wants to do your light bulb for you?\n\n01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.080\nThe short answer is yes.\n\n01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.000\nThe medium answer is she got electrocuted doing it.\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.120\nThe long answer is, I mean, okay.\n\n01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.560\nIs she all right?\n\n01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:56.560\nShe's fine.\n\n01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.200\nThere was a, she was changing a light bulb.\n\n01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.200\nYeah.\n\n01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.200\nIt zaps through her.\n\n01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.200\nWell, since we bring her up, it's 9.37.\n\n01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.200\nLet's move on to D&D.\n\n01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:12.520\nNo, no, no, we're not going to know what it is.\n\n01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.280\nI said at the top of this, we were not going to settle anything.\n\n01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.120\nI only wanted to discuss Jesus Christ.\n\n01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.120\nHey, hey, we're starting D&D.\n\n01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:21.120\nYeah.\n\n01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.120\nWait a minute.\n\n01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.120\nI'm trying to find out by Lawrence.\n\n01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.120\nHey, there's a wall right here.\n\n01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.120\nI think Adam's proven there's no walls in this show.\n\n01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.440\nOkay, let's play D&D.\n\n01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.520\nDan, I will leave it to you to decide who plays Mulrainee.\n\n01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.520\nAll right, let Adam play Mulrainee.\n\n01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.520\nCan we get a woman up?\n\n01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.520\nEmily?\n\n01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.520\nDo you want to play?\n\n01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.520\nOkay.\n\n01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.520\nSorry, Adam.\n\n01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.520\nOh, that's good.\n\n01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.520\nI love you dearly.\n\n01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.520\nEmily's a therapist.\n\n01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.520\nShe's good.\n\n01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.520\nHey.\n\n01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.520\nThis is a good Aaron replacement.\n\n01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.520\nHello, Emily.\n\n01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.520\nHi.\n\n01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.520\nHow's it going, you guys?\n\n01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.520\nVery well.\n\n01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.520\nI spent many years working with the kinds of people you're talking about.\n\n01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:02.520\nYeah, actually, even if it clips as D&D, I want to hear Emily download about this.\n\n01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.520\nWe should have brought her up earlier.\n\n01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.520\nI would just say I spent many years working.\n\n01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:10.020\nI was a therapist for many years working with kids who were one step away from training\n\n01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:12.020\nat school, so they'd be gone forever.\n\n01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:15.520\nKids who were sexual predators to other kids.\n\n01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.520\nMost like...\n\n01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.520\nI love you, Spencer.\n\n01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.520\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.520\nCan you talk about boundaries in this?\n\n01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.520\nYeah.\n\n01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.520\nOkay.\n\n01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:23.520\nYou and I discuss this very often.\n\n01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.520\nThe need that you have to have when you're sitting across from a human being who has\n\n01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:33.020\ntried to rape another child, who is 14 and tried to rape another child, you still have\n\n01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:35.520\nto have empathy for that kid.\n\n01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.920\nThe forgiveness isn't the right word, but empathy, which you said several times, that\n\n01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:40.920\nis the right word.\n\n01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:44.960\nYou have to be able to not feel what they're going through and understand.\n\n01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:50.160\nYou have to be able to say, there's something going on with you that has you doing this,\n\n01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:52.960\nand you're maybe never going to get them to stop wanting to fuck kids, but you can get\n\n01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:57.520\nthem like an alcoholic to learn to avoid situations, and that's all you work with them on.\n\n01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:00.520\nIt's like these day-to-day skills of like, how do you avoid fucking a kid today?\n\n01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.360\nI'm not saying you're not going to fuck a kid tomorrow.\n\n01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.020\nHow do you get them to avoid doing it today?\n\n01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:06.020\nRight.\n\n01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:07.020\nAnd then it's just one day at a time, shit.\n\n01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.520\nAnd you hope you're not stuck in traffic on the next day?\n\n01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:11.520\nYou tell them that.\n\n01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:14.520\nWell, the idea is that they get it, yeah.\n\n01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.520\nOkay, Thursday, there was a wreck on the highway, I fucked three kids.\n\n01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:21.520\nIt's a bad day for those kids.\n\n01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:29.520\nBut Emily, what do you think about imprisoning people who, I mean, if they offend physically?\n\n01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:33.920\nI think we all agree that, well, prison is where we put people who have physically offended,\n\n01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.920\nright?\n\n01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:37.920\nAnd so it's like, what else are you going to do?\n\n01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.920\nI'm trying to work on that part tremendously.\n\n01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:45.920\nBut it's also against the law, isn't it, to consume, to view, to think, to feel?\n\n01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:50.920\nWell, but if you consume, then you're also supporting the act of someone child...\n\n01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:51.920\nBut those people go to prison, right?\n\n01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:52.920\nYeah.\n\n01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:53.920\nSo they've done nothing.\n\n01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.920\nSo there's a weird part of the wall there.\n\n01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:00.920\nThey've supported the industry that they've made money to the people.\n\n01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:01.920\nOkay.\n\n01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:02.920\nYeah.\n\n01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:09.920\nOkay, so if, for instance, I were to ever give perhaps 35% of my salary to something\n\n01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.920\nthat would ever hurt young children, like, I don't know, like a bombing raid on 20 countries\n\n01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.920\nat the same time.\n\n01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:16.920\nYou know there's a line between that.\n\n01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:17.920\nMaybe I should go to prison.\n\n01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.920\nYou understand that there's a difference between having to pay taxes.\n\n01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.920\nThe only line is the one that registers on her all, though.\n\n01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:22.920\nThat's the only line.\n\n01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:23.920\nHere's the difference.\n\n01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:24.920\nThat's the only line.\n\n01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:29.920\nNo, the difference is having to pay taxes versus knowingly giving money to something\n\n01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.920\nthat you know is going for a specific purpose.\n\n01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.920\nYeah, you're purchasing a service, a good or a service, and a good or a service.\n\n01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.920\nYou know the difference.\n\n01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:41.920\nI know the difference, and so I get to keep plotting through my fucking life a little\n\n01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:45.920\nand with me, you know, under a tombstone in a certain system.\n\n01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:50.920\nBut, like, the idea that there's not that much difference between that is, I think,\n\n01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.920\nimportant enough to be stated.\n\n01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.920\nIt's important enough.\n\n01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:57.920\nWhat do you think if there is someone who has fucked one kid and you know...\n\n01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:58.920\nJust one?\n\n01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.920\nForget fucking one kid.\n\n01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.920\nFuck one kid fucking do your bid.\n\n01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:04.920\nThat's my motto.\n\n01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.920\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:07.920\nThat's my new senator.\n\n01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:08.920\nThat's your new motto?\n\n01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.920\nYeah, fuck one kid do your bid.\n\n01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:11.920\nThat's a terrible motto.\n\n01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.920\nThere's not a lot of stuff that rhymes with fuck one kid.\n\n01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:14.920\nYou know what sucks?\n\n01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.920\nIt's a t-shirt.\n\n01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:18.920\nDo your bid has to be on the back.\n\n01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:19.920\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:21.920\nSo it just says fuck one kid.\n\n01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:22.920\nI walk around with it.\n\n01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:23.920\nI swore by it.\n\n01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:27.920\nYeah, listen, at Starbucks, it's fine if they're behind you.\n\n01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.920\nYou know, let's talk about the guy that, you know...\n\n01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:31.920\nYeah, who can't...\n\n01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:32.920\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:35.920\nYeah, the guy with the pictures on his laptop.\n\n01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:36.920\nHe's got a picture of a three-year-old kid.\n\n01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.920\nHas he fucked one kid?\n\n01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:38.920\nHe's got a dick in his butt.\n\n01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:39.920\nHas he fucked one kid?\n\n01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:40.920\nNo.\n\n01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:41.920\nHow many kids is that?\n\n01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:42.920\nNo.\n\n01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:43.920\nHe's got zero kids.\n\n01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:44.920\nHe's got...\n\n01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.920\nBut it's a real control of a kid betting buck fuck somewhere and he has led to that kid getting\n\n01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.920\nbuck fucked by the fact that he supported that industry.\n\n01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.920\nYeah, that guy should definitely be in some kind of...\n\n01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:53.920\nAnd then you gotta...\n\n01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:56.920\nOh, God, it's so complicated because you have to go with, does that guy want to stop?\n\n01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.920\nDoes that guy think what he's doing is wrong?\n\n01:32:58.920 --> 01:32:59.920\nDoes that guy want to stop?\n\n01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.920\nYeah.\n\n01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:01.920\nThat's the thing that I...\n\n01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.920\nLet's put him in prison next to a guy who had a pot plant in his flower box.\n\n01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:05.920\nYeah.\n\n01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.920\nBefore we decided that was legal.\n\n01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:08.920\nYou've talked to pedophiles.\n\n01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.920\nDo they, in your experience...\n\n01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:11.920\nYou've talked to pedophiles?\n\n01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.920\nDated a few.\n\n01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.920\nMarried the one.\n\n01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:17.920\nShe traded up.\n\n01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:18.920\nShe traded up, bro.\n\n01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:19.920\nI traded up.\n\n01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:21.920\nYeah, I don't fuck kids.\n\n01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:22.920\nI don't know if you've gotten that one.\n\n01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.920\nNow you're getting that sweet chocolate mousse every night.\n\n01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:25.920\nYou know what?\n\n01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.920\nI can't believe you keep telling people that.\n\n01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:28.920\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:29.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:35.920\nBy the way, my bid for the title of this episode is Camel's Sweet Chocolate Mousse.\n\n01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.920\nIt's really my sweet chocolate mousse, I would say.\n\n01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.920\nDo they know that the...\n\n01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.920\nDo they know that what they're doing is wrong?\n\n01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:43.920\nYeah.\n\n01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.920\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:45.920\nThey do.\n\n01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.920\nThey know it's immoral that they shouldn't do it.\n\n01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:48.920\nEverybody...\n\n01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:51.920\nAnd I can't speak for everybody, but everybody I've ever talked to absolutely is like,\n\n01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:56.920\nI wish I didn't like this so much, but I do, what do I do?\n\n01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.920\nYeah.\n\n01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:58.920\nSee, didn't like it...\n\n01:33:58.920 --> 01:33:59.920\nLike, didn't like looking at it?\n\n01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.920\nDidn't like...\n\n01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:01.920\nThey wish they didn't like it.\n\n01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:02.920\nYeah, but they do.\n\n01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:03.920\nThey hurt the kids.\n\n01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:04.920\nRight.\n\n01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.920\nSometimes they do when they hurt the kids.\n\n01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:09.920\nBut when you have a kid who's 14 and has...\n\n01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.920\nAnd he's acting out on 12-year-olds because he himself was raped by someone older, like,\n\n01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:15.920\nhow...\n\n01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:17.920\nThat's a tough call to blame that kid for what's happening.\n\n01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.920\nSure.\n\n01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:19.920\nThey have...\n\n01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:20.920\nD and T.\n\n01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.920\nAll right, yeah, what kind of monsters are we fighting on D and D?\n\n01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.920\nI think that we're going to go from a conversation about walls into a dungeon, which is, if not...\n\n01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.920\nIt's defined by its walls.\n\n01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:32.920\nYeah.\n\n01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:33.920\nCompletely into that.\n\n01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:34.920\nI was kind of...\n\n01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.920\nWorld's worst segue!\n\n01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:37.920\nOh.\n\n01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.920\nI can do a...\n\n01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:41.920\nI can do...\n\n01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:45.920\nJeff, I can do a real quick palette cleanser story if you want.\n\n01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:46.920\nDo it.\n\n01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:47.920\nIt'll be real quick.\n\n01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:48.920\nIt's about...\n\n01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:49.920\nOkay, so...\n\n01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.920\nIt'll take, like, five minutes.\n\n01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:52.920\nFive...\n\n01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.920\nWe're kind of...\n\n01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:54.920\nWe've got 15 to do this.\n\n01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:55.920\nAll right.\n\n01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.920\nOkay, well, it'll be real quick.\n\n01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.920\nOkay.\n\n01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.920\nAll right.\n\n01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.920\nOkay, so I was...\n\n01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:00.920\nWhen I was last...\n\n01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.920\nAt one point I talked about how, like, my relationship with my parents...\n\n01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.920\nThis seems like a long story, but it's not.\n\n01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:09.920\nIt's weird where they never, like, talk about, like, my comedy or career or anything.\n\n01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.920\nSo I texted them.\n\n01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.920\nI did a Comedy Central special, like, a couple months ago, and it was a big deal to me.\n\n01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:16.920\nThank you.\n\n01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:17.920\nThank you.\n\n01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.920\nI did my first hour, and I've been doing stand-up for 10 years.\n\n01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:21.920\nIt was, like, a big deal to me, you know?\n\n01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:22.920\nSo I texted them, and I was like,\n\n01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:23.920\nHey, please watch it.\n\n01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.920\nIt means a lot to me.\n\n01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.920\nSo they watched it, and then I got a text from my dad, and it said,\n\n01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:32.920\nSaw your special.\n\n01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:33.920\nThat's it.\n\n01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920\nThat was it.\n\n01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:35.920\nThat was the whole text.\n\n01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:36.920\nNo period at the end.\n\n01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:37.920\nNo period at the end.\n\n01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.920\nNothing.\n\n01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:39.920\nWow.\n\n01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:40.920\nYeah.\n\n01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.920\nThey put a period in your heart.\n\n01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.920\nIt's almost like my dad died during texting it.\n\n01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.920\nMaybe there was a home invasion or something.\n\n01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.920\nYeah.\n\n01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:49.920\nSo I called them.\n\n01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:50.920\nI was like, are you okay?\n\n01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:51.920\nHe's like, yeah, we're fine.\n\n01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:52.920\nWe saw your special.\n\n01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:53.920\nThat's it.\n\n01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.920\nAnd it's thickened.\n\n01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:58.920\nStory gets a couple weeks later.\n\n01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:07.920\nI'm on Amazon reading reviews of my special, and I see one from a certain Shabana Nanjiani.\n\n01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:08.920\nThat's mom.\n\n01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:09.920\nThat's my mom.\n\n01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:10.920\nThat's my mother-in-law.\n\n01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:11.920\nThat's my mom.\n\n01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:14.920\nAnd you could tell from this that she doesn't know that her name is going to be on there.\n\n01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.920\nShe just logged in and reviewed it.\n\n01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:17.920\nNo, it's a good review.\n\n01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:18.920\nIt's a good review.\n\n01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.920\nI hope she's just going to judge.\n\n01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:21.920\nShe just flamed you up.\n\n01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:22.920\nNo.\n\n01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:23.920\nWho is this cocksucker?\n\n01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.920\nBack bitch.\n\n01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:27.920\nThat is the only way it would be better.\n\n01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:31.920\nBut this is like, the subject is no end to laughter.\n\n01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:32.920\nThat's the subject.\n\n01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:33.920\nAw.\n\n01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:34.920\nNow we're talking about it.\n\n01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:35.920\nThat's the, yeah.\n\n01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:36.920\nIt's already kind of ESL though.\n\n01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:37.920\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.920\nIt gets way more ESL.\n\n01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:41.920\nThe description is, here's the words.\n\n01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.920\nI watched the DVD and could not stop laughing.\n\n01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:47.920\nThey were very well performed.\n\n01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:51.920\nNone of the jokes could be called stale.\n\n01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.920\nNot even one.\n\n01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:57.920\nI have been watching other comedy stand-up shows, so now she's like, listen, I've been\n\n01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.920\naround a lot.\n\n01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.920\nShe's pretending like she's someone else.\n\n01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.920\nI've seen a lot of stand-up comedy shows.\n\n01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:10.920\nOkay, now listen to how, this next part, listen to how it is almost a compliment.\n\n01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:11.920\nOkay?\n\n01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:14.920\nPay attention to how this is almost a compliment.\n\n01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:21.920\nI've been watching other stand-up comedy shows also, but this one is by far amongst\n\n01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.920\nthe top most.\n\n01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:26.920\nThank you for your qualifier.\n\n01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.920\nHer mom gland, like, seized up as she almost...\n\n01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.920\nAlmost that.\n\n01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.920\nExactly, her mom gland seized up.\n\n01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.920\nAll jokes were crisp and extremely well executed.\n\n01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.920\nVery fresh, very crunchy.\n\n01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.920\nAll I can say is...\n\n01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.920\nHe was adequate.\n\n01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:47.920\nHe spoke English into a microphone.\n\n01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.920\nAll I can say is hats off to Beta Male.\n\n01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.920\nYay!\n\n01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:54.920\nGood for her.\n\n01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.920\nWait, three stars.\n\n01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.920\nI'm joking, no, it's five, it's five stars.\n\n01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.920\nIf someone read it, they'd be like, it reads like a three-star review.\n\n01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:09.920\nCamille, the amongst thing with her trying to not just write a love letter.\n\n01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:11.920\nShe's trying, yeah.\n\n01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.920\nI can't believe I'm defending her when my mom does the same thing.\n\n01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:18.920\nSo I was telling my friend about this, and my friend's like, you have to text her\n\n01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.920\nand tell her you read it and that it meant a lot to you.\n\n01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.920\nWe have to break this barrier of you guys not talking about this big part of your life.\n\n01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:25.920\nTurn on these walls.\n\n01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:27.920\nSo I texted your mom, exactly.\n\n01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.920\nI don't know if that's the best metaphor, but...\n\n01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:35.920\nI texted my mom and I said, read your Amazon review.\n\n01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:38.920\nThank you so much, meant a lot to me that you enjoyed it.\n\n01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.920\nIt was amongst my favorite reviews.\n\n01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.920\nAmongst the top most.\n\n01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.920\nSo I texted that, meant a lot to me that you enjoyed it.\n\n01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.920\nNo response for two days.\n\n01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.920\nHere's the response.\n\n01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:51.920\nHere's the response.\n\n01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.920\nTwo days later.\n\n01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.920\nSaw Lee Daniels the butler.\n\n01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.920\nPretty good.\n\n01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.920\nThey like movies.\n\n01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.920\nThey really like movies.\n\n01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.920\nThat was the response.\n\n01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.920\nAm I Lee Daniels the butler?\n\n01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:05.920\nIs that what she's talking about?\n\n01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:06.920\nMy dad.\n\n01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:08.920\nMy dad, I have a great relationship with my dad.\n\n01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:09.920\nHe's very straightforward.\n\n01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.920\nHe's very stoic and cool and groovy in old school.\n\n01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:14.920\nI was on some new episodes of Whose Lies Is It Anyway.\n\n01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:15.920\nIt's improv.\n\n01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.920\nIt's not the funniest show in the world.\n\n01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:18.920\nIt's short form improv.\n\n01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.920\nIt's a great show.\n\n01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.920\nIt's a fucking great show.\n\n01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.920\nI don't put it up there with high art.\n\n01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.920\nWe're doing make-a-mups.\n\n01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.920\nI told my dad it was airing.\n\n01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:32.920\nHe normally calls me right away.\n\n01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.920\nHe did not call me.\n\n01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.920\nSo a week later, I called him up.\n\n01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.920\nAnd we're talking about this and about that.\n\n01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:39.920\nAnd he doesn't bring it up.\n\n01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:40.920\nWhich means I know what it means.\n\n01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:41.920\nHe doesn't like it.\n\n01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.920\nAnd so I said, did you see the show?\n\n01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:43.920\nHe goes, yeah.\n\n01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:45.920\nHe goes, look, you were great on it.\n\n01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.920\nBut I told some friends from church to watch it.\n\n01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:50.920\nHe was like, I wish I would have known\n\n01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.920\nnot to tell everybody to watch it.\n\n01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.920\nBut my dad said, I thought it was fine.\n\n01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.920\nBut he was like, the people I told to watch it,\n\n01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:59.920\nthey're 80 and they go to church.\n\n01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:02.920\nAnd Whose Line is one of the gayest television shows\n\n01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:03.920\nin TV history?\n\n01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.920\nI've made out with Colin Mockery more than most women I've dated.\n\n01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:11.920\nAnd more than most women have made out with Colin Mockery.\n\n01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.920\nLet's play a lightning round D&D.\n\n01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.920\nLightning round.\n\n01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.920\nWhen we last met, our heroes were ascending the stairs\n\n01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.920\nof a tall tower.\n\n01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:27.920\nEach stair they climbed was one stair closer to Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:30.920\nThen the gang reached a warm door,\n\n01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:32.920\nand after checking for warm traps,\n\n01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:34.920\nthey bounded into the room.\n\n01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.920\nThe chamber's high ceilings were covered in chains,\n\n01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:40.920\nand three large stone lions stood watch\n\n01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:43.920\nover a lone treasure chest in the room.\n\n01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:46.920\nMulraine opened the chest with Christopherx acid help\n\n01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.920\nand obtained arrows and craft supplies.\n\n01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.920\nThen Sharpie climbed one of the lions\n\n01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.920\nand began removing one of the statues' glinting eyes,\n\n01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:58.920\nas the rest of the heroes also climbed the top lion statues,\n\n01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.920\nfor some reason.\n\n01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:03.920\nSharpie's prying was rewarded by an ominous rumbling\n\n01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.920\nthat shook the entire keep.\n\n01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.920\nIt was scary.\n\n01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.920\nBut what did it mean?\n\n01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:13.920\nWe'll find out now on an all-new episode of Harmontown.\n\n01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:15.920\nWow.\n\n01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.920\nI wonder if we'll find out.\n\n01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:25.920\nSeems like your mom is probably the person you learned to be funny from.\n\n01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:27.920\nShe's a little bummed out. What do you mean?\n\n01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.920\nThat's true. Your mom is funnier.\n\n01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:31.920\nSharpie, what are you talking about?\n\n01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:32.920\nNothing new!\n\n01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.920\nThen I would say she's funnier than your dad.\n\n01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.920\nShe's like sneak attack funnier.\n\n01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:39.920\nMy parents are funny. They just have a weird thing with my...\n\n01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.920\nMy parents are getting divorced.\n\n01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.920\nOh.\n\n01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.920\nSo where am I right now?\n\n01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.920\nHey Spencer, we're trying to play D&D here.\n\n01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:51.920\nI thought it might actually work.\n\n01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:53.920\nLightning round.\n\n01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:57.920\nSo you're on top of a statue, quark.\n\n01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.920\nDoing what? I wasn't here last week.\n\n01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.920\nYou're just standing there to my knowledge.\n\n01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:04.920\nDo you think you were the only reason why your parents were staying together?\n\n01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:05.920\nOh yeah, you know.\n\n01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:07.920\nNow that you moved out...\n\n01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.920\nI just thought if I brought it up, we'd play Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.920\nBut really what it is, you moved out and now they're getting divorced?\n\n01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.920\nYeah, like a couple months later.\n\n01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.920\nIs that right?\n\n01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:17.920\nYeah, well I told them I was the only thing holding their marriage together.\n\n01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:21.920\nKids usually, when I was 10, my parents separated.\n\n01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:24.920\nKids blame themselves for the separation.\n\n01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.920\nThat's the whole idea.\n\n01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:27.920\nBut I feel like it really is his fault.\n\n01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:28.920\nHe's right.\n\n01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.920\nAnd I couldn't be happier.\n\n01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.920\nYou're happy they're getting divorced?\n\n01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.920\nWell, I mean, I always wanted to make them get divorced.\n\n01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.920\nAnd this counts, right?\n\n01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.920\nListen, no, he's right.\n\n01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:39.920\nHe knows his parents and if he thinks they're better off,\n\n01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:40.920\nnot with the...\n\n01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.920\nNo, no, I just want to tell him he's miserable.\n\n01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:48.920\nI will say, if you're parents out there and you're staying together for the kids,\n\n01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:49.920\ngo fuck yourself.\n\n01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:53.920\nOn behalf of the kids of the world, separate.\n\n01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:55.920\nWe're human beings.\n\n01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:00.920\nI have 7 billion exhibit A's.\n\n01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:05.920\nAnd whether or not you staying together makes everything work.\n\n01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:06.920\nFuck you.\n\n01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.920\nSo like, split up, you fucking dicks.\n\n01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:09.920\nSo I'm on top of it.\n\n01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:11.920\nStop blaming me for your marriage.\n\n01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:12.920\nI'm on a statue.\n\n01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.920\nYeah.\n\n01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.920\nYeah, you guys are all on stone lion statues.\n\n01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:21.920\nThey're each about 15 feet tall and everything's rumbling.\n\n01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.920\nIt's all rumbly.\n\n01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:23.920\nLike your parents' marriage?\n\n01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:29.920\nLike, yeah, like the crumbling stones of the foundations of marriage.\n\n01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:30.920\nAll the marriages.\n\n01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:32.920\nOr the walls that are keeping the pedophiles out.\n\n01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:33.920\nYeah.\n\n01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.920\nSame stone, same stone, argument can be made.\n\n01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:39.920\nBuild your walls, build your alliance.\n\n01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.920\nIt all falls down.\n\n01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:42.920\nWink, wink, nudge, nudge.\n\n01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.920\nSanimal, sanimal.\n\n01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:48.920\nI jump off of my statue and go toward the doorway, came in through.\n\n01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.920\nOkay, you do that.\n\n01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.920\nThe rumbling doesn't diminish any.\n\n01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:54.920\nIn fact, it increases.\n\n01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.920\nDo we know where the rumbling is coming from?\n\n01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:57.920\nIt's coming from everywhere.\n\n01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.920\nIt's like an earthquake.\n\n01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:02.920\nNow, who plucked out the eyeballs?\n\n01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:06.920\nHe pulled out, or he was trying to pry out one of the eyeballs.\n\n01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.920\nAnd you're giving it, giving a real, real workings, isn't it?\n\n01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:11.920\nA real workings.\n\n01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:15.920\nYeah, real workings is the old gnome term for it.\n\n01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.920\nShould we try and put the eyeballs back in?\n\n01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:18.920\nIt's not out yet.\n\n01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:19.920\nOh, it's not even out yet.\n\n01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.920\nNo shit.\n\n01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:23.920\nSo you trying to get the eyeball out is what made this rumble start happening?\n\n01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:24.920\nPerhaps.\n\n01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:25.920\nYeah.\n\n01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:27.920\nQuit messing with those eyeballs.\n\n01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.920\nI push it back in.\n\n01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.920\nWhat about those chains that were dangling?\n\n01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:31.920\nThey're still dangling.\n\n01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:32.920\nDo we climb them?\n\n01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:33.920\nDo we know about those chains?\n\n01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:35.920\nYeah, I mean, you know they're on the ceiling.\n\n01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:37.920\nYou could climb them if you're on a statue,\n\n01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:39.920\nbut quark's not on a statue.\n\n01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.920\nThe rest of you guys are.\n\n01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:41.920\nYeah, you just jumped down.\n\n01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.920\nI get back on my statue.\n\n01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.920\nIt's not your turn, bro.\n\n01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:47.920\nWe're not in combat right now.\n\n01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:48.920\nI can do whatever I want.\n\n01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:49.920\nGet back up there.\n\n01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:50.920\nDon't tell me what to do.\n\n01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:51.920\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:52.920\nIf you like.\n\n01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:54.920\nDon't build walls around me.\n\n01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.920\nYou can get up there.\n\n01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.920\nAll right.\n\n01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:57.920\nI'm back on my statue.\n\n01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:58.920\nYeah.\n\n01:44:58.920 --> 01:44:59.920\nSounds good.\n\n01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:01.920\nDoes anyone else want to try anything?\n\n01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:03.920\nI want to try to climb one of the chains\n\n01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:05.920\nand see what happens.\n\n01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:06.920\nI like that.\n\n01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:07.920\nOh, he's going for the dice.\n\n01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:08.920\nOh, he's getting on his dice.\n\n01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:11.920\nHe's like a real game in everything.\n\n01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:14.920\nYou climb atop the chains.\n\n01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.920\nNow you're hanging from chains.\n\n01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:18.920\nI passed that president's fitness test.\n\n01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.920\nI could do this for a while.\n\n01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:21.920\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.920\nSo you hear the rumbling.\n\n01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:25.920\nIt was intensifying.\n\n01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:26.920\nNow it stops completely.\n\n01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.920\nAnd as soon as it stops, you hear,\n\n01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.920\nit sounds like a viscous fluid.\n\n01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:33.920\nAnd out of the mouths of these lions,\n\n01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:35.920\npours hot, bubbling, glowing lava.\n\n01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.920\nSee?\n\n01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:39.920\nAnd it begins filling up, filling up this floor here.\n\n01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.920\nOh, you guys better get on these chains.\n\n01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.920\nNow the floors, they're all, they're all lava-y.\n\n01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.920\nOh, but we're safe on top of our statues, right?\n\n01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:46.920\nCurrently.\n\n01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:47.920\nCurrently.\n\n01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:48.920\nYeah.\n\n01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.920\nYeah.\n\n01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:50.920\nAll right.\n\n01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:51.920\nGood move on my part to be on top of these things.\n\n01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:52.920\nAll right.\n\n01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:53.920\nWhat do you see on top of that chain?\n\n01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:54.920\nIs there anything up at the top of it?\n\n01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.920\nSo from your vantage point, like you can only see more chains.\n\n01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:59.920\nSo it's almost like there's a huge canopy of chains\n\n01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:02.920\nabove your head that's blocking above,\n\n01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.920\nbut you can only see blackness.\n\n01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:06.920\nAnd you're just on one of these dangling ones.\n\n01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:07.920\nSo you'd have to climb up.\n\n01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:08.920\nDoes anybody have a light?\n\n01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:09.920\nDoes anybody have a light?\n\n01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:10.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.920\nI can cast light.\n\n01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:13.920\nI have low light vision.\n\n01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.920\nEither one of those do things.\n\n01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:16.920\nAnd I have a torch.\n\n01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:17.920\nYou want a torch?\n\n01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:18.920\nYeah.\n\n01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:19.920\nShe's up there.\n\n01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.920\nWell, you guys can climb up your chain.\n\n01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:21.920\nYeah, climb up your chain.\n\n01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:23.920\nI jump to a chain and start climbing up a chain.\n\n01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:24.920\nMy arms are so strong.\n\n01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:25.920\nYou don't.\n\n01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:26.920\nI have a 12.\n\n01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:27.920\nA 12 climb.\n\n01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:29.920\nA 12 climb.\n\n01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.920\nBonus modifier.\n\n01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:32.920\nYeah.\n\n01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:33.920\nWell, what's your acrobatics?\n\n01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:36.920\nI mean, you're, yeah, acrobatics.\n\n01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:38.920\nIt's jumping three, five.\n\n01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:39.920\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.920\n11.\n\n01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:41.920\n11.\n\n01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:42.920\nOkay.\n\n01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.920\nWell, see that counts and that you jump onto the chain\n\n01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:48.920\nand you grab it with both hands.\n\n01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:49.920\nAll right.\n\n01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.920\nIt's a different chain than the one she's on.\n\n01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:52.920\nCorrect.\n\n01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.920\nYeah.\n\n01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:54.920\nI start climbing up it.\n\n01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:55.920\nAll right.\n\n01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:58.920\nYou do so with great gusto.\n\n01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.920\nIs everyone climbing chains?\n\n01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.920\nShould I jump on a chain or?\n\n01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.920\nYou do what you want, man.\n\n01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.920\nIt seems pretty, pretty all right.\n\n01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:08.920\nSeems like a good idea so far.\n\n01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:11.920\nBut can I, do I have anything that, so that she can see\n\n01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:12.920\nbecause it's dark up there?\n\n01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:13.920\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:14.920\nDo you have a torch?\n\n01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.920\nOh, you have the goggles of night.\n\n01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:17.920\nMe do?\n\n01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.920\nYeah.\n\n01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:19.920\nYou do.\n\n01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:25.920\nMe through goggles at night.\n\n01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.920\nMe do some big workings.\n\n01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:29.920\nCan I throw them to her?\n\n01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:30.920\nYeah.\n\n01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:31.920\nIs there a chance she won't catch it?\n\n01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:32.920\nDefinitely.\n\n01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:33.920\nYeah.\n\n01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:34.920\nAll right.\n\n01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:36.920\nI feel like his role playing is less cocksure\n\n01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:40.920\nbecause his wife is in the mix.\n\n01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:43.920\nWell, I get on the chain.\n\n01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.920\nHoney, don't hurt yourself.\n\n01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:47.920\nThat this person unknown to me is on\n\n01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.920\nand I climb all the way up and I go,\n\n01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.920\nhey, honey, here's the goggles of night.\n\n01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:55.920\nLeaping, leaping onto the chains\n\n01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:56.920\nwho do as you described\n\n01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:58.920\nand you give her the goggles of night.\n\n01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:00.920\nOkay, so I put the goggles on.\n\n01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:01.920\nI'm looking up.\n\n01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:02.920\nOh, man.\n\n01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.920\nYou see a large metal hatch in the ceiling\n\n01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.920\nthrough all these chains.\n\n01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:07.920\nYeah.\n\n01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:09.920\nI climb.\n\n01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:11.920\nI climb to the hatch.\n\n01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:13.920\nBut before you could climb to the hatch,\n\n01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.920\nyou hear a voice call out\n\n01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:17.920\nechoing through the chamber above.\n\n01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:18.920\nOh, boy.\n\n01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:20.920\nYou've managed to live.\n\n01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:23.920\nYou've managed to last.\n\n01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:29.920\nBut how can you handle this blast from your past?\n\n01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:31.920\nAnd then it's Brandon Frazier.\n\n01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:34.920\nWoo!\n\n01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:38.920\nSo on hearing that,\n\n01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.920\nthe hatch in the ceiling that only you can see\n\n01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:43.920\nbegins to open and you see\n\n01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.920\nthe large multi-legged form\n\n01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.920\ncoming out of this hole.\n\n01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:49.920\nTell us about it.\n\n01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:50.920\nI'm fucking freaking out, man.\n\n01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:52.920\nOh, you're fucking freaking out.\n\n01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:54.920\nIt looks like a cross\n\n01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.920\nbetween some sort of spider and humanoid.\n\n01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:58.920\nYou see three of its legs are replaced\n\n01:48:58.920 --> 01:48:59.920\nwith metal spikes.\n\n01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:00.920\nOh, no.\n\n01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:02.920\nIt has several scars on its body\n\n01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:05.920\nand it has a large hole in the back of its head.\n\n01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.920\nIt's covered in metal placed.\n\n01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:09.920\nIs this the one that I thought was when he was dead?\n\n01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:10.920\nYeah.\n\n01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:11.920\nIt's Preppy.\n\n01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:13.920\nPreppy now.\n\n01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.920\nYou hear a metallic voice ring out.\n\n01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.920\nI'm Preppy.\n\n01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:20.920\nOh, Cliff Hanger!\n\n01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:26.920\nThank you, everybody, for coming to Harmontown\n\n01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:29.920\non an all pedophilia night.\n\n01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:31.920\nListen, don't build a wall\n\n01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:34.920\nbetween yourself and a pedophile tonight.\n\n01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:38.920\nFind one pedophile and lower the wall.\n\n01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:39.920\nNo, don't do that.\n\n01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.920\nLet's thank Lauren, Adam, Kelly, was it?\n\n01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:46.920\nLaura, Emily Gordon, Kumail

Harmontown.\n\n01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.920\nWe didn't really make it to the mood,\n\n01:49:58.920 --> 01:49:59.920\nbut we got pretty close.\n\n01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:00.920\nI know what it is.\n\n01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:02.920\nIf it's easy to hate somebody,\n\n01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:04.920\nmaybe don't hate him.\n\n01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.920\nIf it's hard to hate somebody,\n\n01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.920\nmaybe hate him.\n\n01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.920\nThat's what I was trying to get through to.\n\n01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:12.920\nGood night.
