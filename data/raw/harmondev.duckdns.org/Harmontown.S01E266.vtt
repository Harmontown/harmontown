00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
What's up Harmontown, hello hello hello, you know I'm gonna start it from here welcome to beautiful uptown Burbank everybody Harmontown is now in session

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
Speaking of special, let's bring out your game master, Spencer Crittenden

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
And of course if you're a Comptroller, I'm very happy to be back with Jeff Davis

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Let's bring out the man of the hour, the mayor of Harmontown dinner

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
Thank you, thank you

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
Not a lot to talk about tonight, there was a gunman at large in Las Feliz last night

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah, I never heard what the denouement of that was

01:16.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah, well I don't think they caught him and I don't think they ever told anybody what was going on, so I think maybe it was like some kind of soylent green or body snatchers thing like the guy, maybe the guy was, maybe he knew too much

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
They either did or didn't catch him but in either case they can't tell us what happened

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Do you think it was Antifa?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
It could have been Antifa

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
You're looking very smart and you're in your bright red Cornell hoodie

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
Thank you, I just got back from Ithaca, New York and they gave me this hoodie

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
I thought it was a mistake to give me a women's studies degree, like I don't think, I don't know if I earned that

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
But as Susan B. Anthony says, fuck it, because I didn't earn the degree

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Did they make you an honorary doctor or anything?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
No

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
How does that work when you get an honorary degree or something? You can't use it for anything, right?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
It must be watermarked honorary

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah, I think they say honorary

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
You can't just use it to go get a job

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
You can try

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
But red's kind of a nice color on your den, I've never seen you wear bright red

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah, I don't wear a lot of red

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah, I like it

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Also wearing a Cornell hoodie, you look very collegiate

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
You look like you might have just taught poli sci

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah, I had a good time at that school

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I guess that's a gig now that I can do

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
I hit some kind of tipping point where I can get invited to speak at colleges

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
The ratio of money to labor, which is, well, zero labor

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
And you're just talking to people that want, I mean, it was just a dude asking me questions

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
It was just like doing this show, but worse, I mean, like not

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
It wasn't as entertaining, but they were eating it up

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And you were in that big, beautiful theater there

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah, it was a gorgeous theater, everybody was really nice, you know

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Just laughed at everything I said

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Were they too PC?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I hear that's a problem

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Now, nothing of that sort came up really

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
It was just a lot of questions about writing and stuff

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
Kids, you know, TV is dispersed enough now as an industry

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
There's less money in it, but, you know, now that there's 500,000 places to make television

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
It's kind of satisfying to see these kids are talking about TV like it's carpentry or something

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
You know, like it's a viable occupation now

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
And if it's viable enough, if it's achievable enough

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
And that's going to mean very quickly, hopefully the representational problems that we have will be, you know

03:59.000 --> 04:08.000
Those will get sorted out pretty fast as soon as you can actually think about TV writing as a potential job

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
The problem is, how the fuck is it?

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
You're making even less money now

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
There's more places to try to sell your TV show

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
So everybody's questions, they're all taking like these TV writing classes and stuff

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
And everybody's questions are all, you know, how, what do I do?

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
And I don't really have the answers for those kids

04:32.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm not somebody that took a normal path through the system

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I don't like me

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah, you have a show

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
I would say you took the most time honored of all the trajectories to get to where you are

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
Right, I kept my head down, I just put one foot in front of the other, you know, did the work

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
Spencer started running

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, I hadn't really talked about it on the podcast because I didn't want to break the spell

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
But now I've basically stopped running so we could talk about it

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
For a while Spencer was tweeting there, I jagged 15 miles today and all this shit

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
I read those, the first one or two of those I thought was a little bit of irony or like you were being facetious

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
But no, you're really getting it done

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
And that was only after I was confident enough in my skills to actually publicize it

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I was going for quite a while before I was doing that

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Are you in a treadmill or are you out in the streets?

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
No, I was on Griffith Park, out in Griffith Park, running around in a big circle

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Is that why your back is all jacked up right now?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah, that's what I think

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
So your knee exploded, right?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah, it's no good

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm going to get a drink with you

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
There was a time that I was jogging and then like when I'd be driving my knees would hurt

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
And...

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
So, okay

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Oh, for some reason I thought that Chris is making that noise

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
But it's a sound board

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Zac McKeever, our sound guru, told me to get some sound effects because we have no audience

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
That's a bad fart sound

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I mean, I guess it's like a free app fart sound

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
That's a sound? That's a professional sound?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
See, that's so bad

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I'm making a fart sound

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Okay, I'm sorry

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
No, it's fine, I'm just insulting you

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
See, this is bad

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
See, that one's called nose

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
That's someone blowing their nose, but that sounds like a better fart, doesn't it?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Right, yeah, no

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
It definitely sounds like a better fart

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
We've got to get you some good Foley artists to work with

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Oh my god, we do

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
You should get a Foley artist instead of a sound board

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
Oh my god, we should have full on old timey radio shows

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Foley guys, we can put them under your podium

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
The story is going somewhere because Spencer hurt his knees back

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah, so just while driving it would hurt my knee while I was driving

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
And then I was like, oh, driving is fucking up my knee and I kept running

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
But I think that running was fucking up my knee

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
And I was only feeling it while I was driving until it got so bad that I felt it after I was running

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
And then I was like, oh, I bet I'm fucking myself up

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
And it was bad

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
And so then again, it was only hurt when I sit and when I was driving

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
And it would be the worst because I drive for work and also I drive for recreation

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
I would say I drive between two and three hours a day, most days

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
And most of that's just for fun, you know

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
And so it got

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
You just get out on the open road and just

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Oh yeah, Blastin' Doughboys, it's a real fun time

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
So, you went to get

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Well, I went to the doctor and but the day I went to the doctor

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Then I started getting what I think is sciatica pain

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Which is like on the side of your lower back

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah, it goes down your ass, cheek and down into your

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah, I would feel it right under my ass and then in my foot

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
And it was like really bad and so I went to see the doctor and he was like, oh, it's just inflammation

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
And I was like, well, there's this new thing that's coming up and he was like sciatica

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
And I was like, I don't know what that is and he was like, it's like your legs burning

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
And I was like, well, no

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
I was like, okay, but then I looked it up after I left and I was like, well, fuck no, that was what I had

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
He described it wrong, yeah, if he had said a tingling

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Or like almost like an electrical pain

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
Going shooting down your leg, just starting somewhere in your ass cheek

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And then going down, I had that really bad

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I thought I was gonna have to live with that forever

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
What'd you do?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Nothing?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Well, the first thing that fixed it was an inversion table

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Oh, right

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
And then it started coming back and I may have fucked up my back more with the inversion table

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
I was evangelizing inversion tables for a while

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
Then McGathey had gone to some chiropractor

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
And that's Dr.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
God, his name is Dr. Phil

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Oh, yeah

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Oh, no

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
And he doesn't like inversion tables?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Well, no, of course not

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
You know, Dan, I hear that in the medical community

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Dr. Phil is known as something of a

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Oh, yeah

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
If you want this to be a morning zoo show

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I've taken the shit to a new level

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
People thought when we lost the audience the show was gonna suffer a showbiz once

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
No, we're reaching untold heights

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah, this is real

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
But you could have done that when there was an audience here

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I know

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
We're evolving

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
While the audience isn't here, it's kind of like being in a cocoon

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah, so while the knee pain was bad, this nerve pain was unbearable

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And it came on a lot faster

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
And so I was like, I can't sit, which is a big part of my job

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I can't drive, which is a bigger part of my job

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I'm really freaking out

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
And then I couldn't run

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
So it's like everything that I had been doing with my life

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I just all of a sudden couldn't do

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
And I was like, what am I doing with my life?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And so I talked to Brian LaFatta

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
And he was like, my brother does traditional Chinese medicine

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You should see someone like that

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And then I was like, acupuncture

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
And he was like, sure

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And so I was like, you know who does acupuncture?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Steve Agee

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
And he also has terrible health

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
So I asked him what the deal was

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
And he recommended me to an acupuncturist

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And I was like, yeah, because I got this sciatica

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
And he was like, holy shit, they really did wonders on my sciatica

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
And I was like, oh yeah, jackpot

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
And so I went like two or three days later

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
That's the thing is that I was scheduling these doctor's appointments

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And it's like, we could see you in two weeks or whatever the fuck

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
But then the acupuncturists were like, yeah, come in tomorrow

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Like come in the next day

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
And I was like, hell yeah, so it was great

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Because at this point it was like another week or so

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Before I'd get another doctor appointment

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
And I was in terrible pain

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
So I go to the acupuncturist

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I couldn't sit down

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
The drive over to the acupuncturist was like torture

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
It was really, really bad

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And by the time I was out of the car

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I was like, I don't want to sit back down

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
And so I filled out the paperwork standing up

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And then they brought me into this room

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
That had all this weird new age music

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
And relaxing music and a little steamy thing

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Making vaporizing water into the air

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
And they laid me down onto a table

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
And I think this is part of it

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
There's like, they cultivate an air of mystique

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
They don't tell you anything, you know

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
And there's things that I took as maybe cold reading techniques

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
She was like, you don't drink enough water

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
And I was like, I drink a ton of water

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I don't know

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
But I actually didn't drink any water that day

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
And when I peed after I left

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
And my pee was like neon yellow

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And I was like, wow, she really was right

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
So they didn't tell me what I was doing

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
She just started stabbing needles into my back

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And it hurt really bad

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Really?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
They go, I mean, not really bad

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I mean, worse than a shot

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
But they poke it

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
And then I don't know why they do it

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
But they kind of push it in further

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Kind of twisted around or something

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I think she was trying to hit a nerve or whatever

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Because then sometimes she would stab it right into like

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
What felt like a nerve and then it would just shoot

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Like lightning down my body, you know

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
And I was like, you're trying to stay still

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
But like your whole body's like jerking

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Because someone's stabbing you with fucking needles

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Into your nerves, which are the things that are supposed to

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Feel things the most, you know

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
It was really crazy

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
So she put the needles in

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
And then she left me for a while

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
And just left

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
And then she came back

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
And then she attached the wires to the needles

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
And was like, tell me when you feel it

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
And I was like, I don't feel it

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
And she was like, tell me when you feel it

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
And I'm like, what am I supposed to feel?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
And she was like, you'll know

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
And then eventually it started feeling

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Like someone was like rattling the little needles

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Because of the electrical shock

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I don't know if it was jiggling the needles or whatever

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
But it was like, so now I'm getting electricity

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Sent through these needles that stabbed into my nerves

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
You know, and she turned up the power pretty high

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Because I wasn't feeling it

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And she was like, oh, you're a strong guy

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
And I was like, I don't know

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
I have a low pain tolerance

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
It's just pretty painful to be stabbed

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I'm just not feeling the lightning

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
So then she turned on the lightning

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
And it was just zapping my body

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
And it was making my muscles twitch and stuff

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
And she's like, just hang out here

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
And I was like, for how long?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And it felt like 20 minutes

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Just with this machine buzzing

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And just vibrating my body

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
And I was making my nerves light up and glow

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
It was really crazy

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
But it felt like it was doing something

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
Because those very same nerves that were in terrible pain

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Were the ones that are now buzzing with electricity and stuff

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
So it felt like something was happening

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
And then eventually the machine finished

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
And it made this crazy beeping sound

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And she came back in and she took it all off

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And then I didn't know this was going to happen

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Because again, there's no communication

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
She just basically shows up and starts doing stuff

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And she starts cupping me

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
You guys know about cupping?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Oh yeah, I do now, yeah

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah, I'm sure you do

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
Cupping is so weird, it better work

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah, I don't know

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
She cupped me basically on the same

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
If you don't know what cupping is

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
It's like a suction cup that they put

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And then they use like a balloon pump or some shit

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
To suck all the air of it

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
So now like your skin is like sucking up

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
I thought the artisanal way of doing that

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
Is if they put like a match in there

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Right, but she was just using what sounded like a balloon pump

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Like you can't see because they put you face down at a table

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
And you're looking through like a toilet seat at a chair

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
That's below your face

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
And like you don't know anything that they're doing

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
You just assume it's not make like placebo magic

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
But yeah, so she cut me in all these spots

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
And that was really painful

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Like that was as bad as it is to be stabbed with needles

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
That are shooting lightning through your body

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Like being cupped was really bad

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
Are you gonna be mad at Levy if I saw the photo?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
No, I know that happened

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
You could have just asked, man

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I'm the victim of revenge porn

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
I didn't

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Well, I didn't

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
You know, it's Levy had it on his phone

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I was like, oh shit, and I saw it

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
And then I just

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm not usually like I just

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
It was just like the air drop thing came up

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
But I just before I even knew what I was doing

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
I just hid it

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Why did it come up?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Well, I don't know

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
It was just there

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Yeah, that's not your fault if an air drop window pops

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Well, no, it was

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I mean, maybe it's because I hit the share button

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I don't know

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Oh, well, yeah, okay

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Well, that's what the story was

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah, so you definitely did it

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I didn't know what I was doing

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I was just like, well, this seems like a valuable photo

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
I wasn't gonna show it to anybody else

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I just, yeah, I really don't know

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
That's how it starts

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Why that was my instinct

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
But you wouldn't show it to the viewers

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
No, that's the

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
What's embarrassing about that picture is

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Not like it's everything but the cupping marks

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Like, I have weird acne scars on my back

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
And then stretch marks and like way too much hair

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Like, I took the picture and I was like, man

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I wish that my skin was better

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Because these cupping scars are crazy

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
But this is like a gross picture

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Well, so anyways, I then take our word for it

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Like, it's fucking like

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
You can see cupping pictures online

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
It looks exactly like that

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Except on my ass

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
It's like giant hickeys

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
The diameter of a softball

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Like a wine glass

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
What's the idea is it's drawing toxins out of your

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
That's what they said

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
She was like, it's turning color

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
That means it's working because it takes stuff out of you

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
And it's like, it's turning color

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Because all the oxygen is being rushed out of my skin

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
To the surface of the skin

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Because of a vast pressure differential

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Has nothing to do with toxins

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
But it felt like anti-acupuncture

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Because they were stabbing me before

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
And then those same spots they stab me

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
They were then sucking, you know, air

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I don't know if it was like

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
But they look just like bruises

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Are they, when you touch them

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Do they hurt as much as a bruise?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
That size would hurt

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
One of them kind of hurts

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
The rest don't really feel like anything

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
That's interesting

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Yeah, but

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
It just looks like a straight up paintball bruise

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Even worse really

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Just like deep purple

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah, it was really painful

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
It's like if you know you get an Indian burn

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Like they twist your skin on your arm

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Or whatever

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
It felt like that for like 10 minutes

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
While the cups were on my back

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
It was really bad

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
But also they were making my muscles twitch

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
With the lightning

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
And so then like the muscles that were twitching

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Just felt like I had exercised them to death

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Like they felt dead and really really really sore

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
And so then by the time it was finished

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
I didn't feel like it wasn't crazy

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Vast nerve pain

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Like I still felt that nerve like acting up

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
But it just kind of felt like my ass was sore

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
And then I was like wow that's really crazy

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
And so yeah then I drove home

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
And I wasn't in terrible pain on the trip home

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Which was the same journey, you know the same length trip

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
And then the next day it felt a lot better

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
And then the next day it felt a lot better

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
And today I feel basically nothing

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I was like driving around all today

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
You can kind of feel it a little bit coming in

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
After about an hour of driving

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
You feel nothing as in a good thing

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
You're not numb

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Wow

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I was told because I had a little sciatica like pain

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
A while back

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
And I was told and it instantly worked

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Is do sit ups, do ab stuff

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah the one thing I looked up online

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Was this one stretch where you put your leg on a chair

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
And then you kind of pull your toe inward

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
And I kept doing that and I think it was helping

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
There was one time I was driving and I had to like

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Stop driving and get out of the car

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
And then I just walked around for a bit

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
And then stretched my leg like that until I could get back in

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
And it was no good

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Here's the tough thing about back pain

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Is it

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
You know your story is about

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You know the doctor said

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
It's inflammation

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Right

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
And he could just be

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
But that was when he was right

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
He wasn't talking about the sciatica at all

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Because like he didn't know that was happening

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Or you know he didn't understand it was like

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Well anyways I mean it's like

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
It could have been

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Because it could have been something pushing

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
It probably was

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Pushing your sciatic nerve

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And then that just got reduced

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
And now we don't know if acupuncture works

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Right that's the thing is that

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Anytime I do anything like that

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I always have to ask is like

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
If I didn't do anything

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Wouldn't I also improve to an extent

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Over time anyway

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
But I don't know when I talked to Steve

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
He said he got it for really long bursts

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
And it didn't feel like it was going away

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
But then after that treatment

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
It just instantly started going away

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
So I don't know but I mean you know

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Not like intuitively

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
I don't know

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
I will say

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Now that I've been going to this chiropractor

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
For as long as I have

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I can definitely scientifically say

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Comparing it to

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
40 years of

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Other back treatments?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Yeah

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Of going to different chiropractors

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And then not going to them

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
The inversion table and stuff like

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Whatever my chiropractors doing is actually

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
It has me pain free

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
I really thought

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
My whole family

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
It's the one thing that we

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Have as a weakness on both sides of my

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Family like we have

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Really strong tooth enamel

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
Strong toenails

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Strong hearts

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Lungs

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Everything's

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
You know we don't have a lot of like

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Streaks of like proclivities

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
You know for ailment

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Going through my family tree

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
We just kind of drink ourselves to death

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Or smoke

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Do you find that the strong toenails

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Has benefited you and your family?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Well Cody was just pointing that out

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
The other day

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
I was like

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
She was like wow

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
You must be really healthy

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Like these disgusting toenails

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
That you need to clip immediately

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Are really like

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
I don't know what

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
They're not flimsy and jaundiced

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
They're like eagle talons

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Exactly

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
If you're just joining us

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I'm gross

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
But if you haven't seen Dan

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Swoop through your neighborhood

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
And catch a squirrel

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
It's amazing

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I'm also a bad person

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
So last time I was on this stage

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
I made fun of

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I think that's a good description

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I made fun of

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
The podcast

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Up and vanished

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Hosted by Payne Lindsay

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Who you know

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I just kind of characterised him as a

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
As a guy that you know

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
He doesn't know what he's doing

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
He didn't know what he was doing

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
He learns what he's doing

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
But then he

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
But it's just like a podcast

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
About him going like

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I don't know how to

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
I want to try

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I don't know

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
I kind of made fun of him

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I don't think I was like

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
High-fiving him

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I don't think I was that flattering

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
And then tonight

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I saw that he

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
He tweeted

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
It was clear

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
He had heard the thing

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Because I said he sounded like Chris Pratt

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
And he said

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
So he tweeted

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
I saw a tweet from him

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
And said

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Well at least I sound like Chris Pratt

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
And then

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
I think they had an emoji

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
That was like

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Kind of like a guy

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
With a hand over his face

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Or something like that

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Like he was embarrassed

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Because then

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Cody looked him

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Looked him up

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
You know

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
And you know

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
He's just an adorable guy

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
You know

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Loves his wife

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
And like

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
He did a good true crime podcast

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
And then I made fun of him

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
And I didn't want him to hear it

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
You know that some shit had like

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Yeah

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Someone just probably told him about it

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Like couldn't resist

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
You know

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
I just don't understand that

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Like the person that felt the need to

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Ron Jeremy

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
To track down Ron Jeremy's

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Reddit and then

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Yeah

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I still maintain that that guy though

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
If he's listening

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
I didn't really

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
I know a good person

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
I didn't really think that that guy

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
No

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
The guy that went to Ron Jeremy

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
I didn't

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I didn't

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
I didn't feel like that guy

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Was

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Was really

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Trying to cause B for

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
It's just weird that like

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
You say something

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Like I mean

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
It's stupid to think

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
That what we're doing here

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Is in a vacuum

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Of course what we say

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Will send ripples out

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
And butterfly effects

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
And all this shit

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
But

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Like it's just like

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Everything we say

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Can reach

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
It's unintended target

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Probably will

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
And maybe

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Maybe Payne Lindsay

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Was already a listener

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Which would be rad

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
You know

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
He's a

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
He's a fun guy

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
He'd make a great guest

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
We should have him on the show

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Maybe Ron Jeremy's

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
He sounds like Chris Pratt

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
We should get Ron Jeremy on the show

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Get to the bottom of that shit

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Well we did get to the bottom of it

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I think we have to go straight to the source

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
That would be amazing

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
If we got him on the show

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
We were interviewing

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
And we were like

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Well I gotta ask

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I gotta ask

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
What's with the

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
What's with the

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Banana peel

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
He has every

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
He has every right

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
To say

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I don't know what you're talking about

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Maybe I was drunk and doing a joke

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Like he might just

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Like

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Throw that away

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Like so many

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Banana peels

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Oh shit

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
He would have a right to do that

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
But that would make him a big liar

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Because when

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
When the person said it to him

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
He

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
He had a very quick response

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
That

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
He knew exactly what that person was talking about

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
I think he had a fallback

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
I think

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
When somebody

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Goes on his reddit

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
And asks him

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Specific questions

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
He has a cute answer

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
That's very

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Convenient

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
But in the moment

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
I think he had ulterior motives

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
That were way more complicated

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
In the moment

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
He could be both

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I think that's giving him too much credit

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
For being clever to say

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Like he has all these versions

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Of how to deal with people

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Asking him about a banana peel

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Did we talk about

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
My conversation with

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
David Keith

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Keith David

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Keith David

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
I always do that

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Keith David

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
About cross-mounted pussy

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
We've talked about on the show

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
I believe right

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Yeah I mean

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
It's been going on for so long

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I can't remember

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
But when he was on

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Ricky Morty

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Like I think the last

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Ricky Morty right

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
Maybe we're repeating old news here

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
But there's a line in the movie

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Platoon

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
That Keith David says

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
And he refers to going back

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Sniffing that cross-mounted pussy

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Down by the river

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
And Matt Gorley and I

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
From Super Ego fame

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
And Harmon Quest fame

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Have really tried to get to the bottom

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Of what is cross-mounted pussy

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Why is it cross-mounted

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
What are the pros and cons

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Of it being cross-mounted

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
And Dan worked with him

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
On community a couple of times

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
And you asked him

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
And you didn't get a satisfactory answer to that

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
No

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
He was so nice when I met him

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I was wearing this exact same suit

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
With a kind of a little window pane check

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
And he was wearing a similar suit

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
There's a photo that I have

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
I think on my Insta noodles

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
And he was so pleasant

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
I go okay I'm going to be

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
That guy and I'm going to ask you

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
About platoon

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
So I got some platoon questions

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Where he's like lay him on me

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And we talked and talked and talked

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
About cross-mounted pussy

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
And we finally came to the conclusion

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
He goes look man I don't know

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
That was some Oliver Stone shit

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Like he just said that was

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I was just reading my lines

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Oh yeah

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
So the answer is we don't know

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
So now I don't want to have to deal

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
With Oliver Stone about this issue

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Because he's going to do a run Jeremy

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
And have some fucking terse

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Convenient answer that doesn't satisfy

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Me or anybody else

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Why can't you believe that's his line

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Because here's the thing

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
It's like you're expecting it

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
To be something dirty I think

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Because it's like a banana

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
And so the fact that it's not

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
That's like it's a brilliant move

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
What I think it was

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
I think he had a banana peel on his shoulder

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I don't think he had a clever line

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Ready to go or a dirty line

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Like a salacious like rejoinder

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
When somebody asked him about it

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I do know that he seemed bummed out

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
When a guy asked him about it

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
From behind his back

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
So that leads me in that direction

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
But I think that maybe he was just doing that

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I think he was in a bad mood

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
No come on we've been over this

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
We got this figured out from top to bottom

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
It's a thing that he does

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
If he sees a banana peel

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
He does that

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
It's one of maybe five things

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
That he has up his sleeve

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
And he likes to be funny

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Probably for the girls

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
And didn't want to be vulnerable

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
With you and was like

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
Yeah I mean you just saw a weird side of him

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I think then he takes a banana peel

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
When you ask him if you're a woman

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Why are you wearing a banana peel

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I think it ends up with somehow

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Pussy being cross mounted

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
And I think the cross mounted pussy

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Is like it's holy it's holy pussy

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
It's like it's like on a cross

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
It's like Christ pussy

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Oh shit yeah

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
It's like the best pussy

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
That was one of our theories we thought about

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
That's probably a cross mounted pussy

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Gross

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Yeah

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
If you love a pussy don't crucify it

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
That's about it

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
It's Schrab's birthday

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Oh yeah

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
He's not here

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
He's off somewhere

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
But I have to for Schrab leaves town tomorrow

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
He goes back to Milwaukee

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
And he's going to speak at his alma mater

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
If I'm using that term right

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
The place he graduated from

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
The Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
And he wanted me to do like a

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
An introduction on video for him

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
So I guess we could

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
We could knock that out right now

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Because you're able to

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
In addition to live streaming it

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
You can like also

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Yeah you'll have it

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
And then I can just give him a clip right

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Yeah

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Do you want some music for this Dan

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Or do you want to go dry

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
What do you have

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
I don't know

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
I mean just the regular shit

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
You want to beat

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
You want to wrap it out

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Sure

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000

Day to day

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000

That

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
That

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000

That's a little

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Sneak Preview

Rob Schrab

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
So don't

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Make your questions

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Too bold

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
He might get scared

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
And might run away

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
And then

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Eat some prune juice

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
And curds and whey

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
It's all he can digest

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
At this point

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
He's like a mummy

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Food that's too harsh

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Hard on his tummy

He's

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
He's 57 years old

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
But he's sold

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
His comic book

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Writes to Oliver Stone

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
In 1996

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
And

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
That's why I'm standing here

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
All right

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Let's

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Take it from the top

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
In case it needs to be clean

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000

Okay

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
I'm going to start the beat from the top

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
So you have some

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Okay

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Interframe, right?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Yo

If you ask him for wisdom

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
You might get it

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
I can't

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
I can't

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000

Just rhyming

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Here we go

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
I think this is the one

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
I think this is the one

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
I can feel it

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
My name is M.C. Dan

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
I've got a rap

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
This one has a plan

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I'm going to introduce to you

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
A very great man

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
He went to your school

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
With his butt in the can

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
It's all he had for tuition

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Back then

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
But he worked real hard

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
And he started to win

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
He took fine arts

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
He took graphic design

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
He ate your mama's pussy

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
With a squeeze of water

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
And he was like

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
What the fuck

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
What the fuck

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
What the fuck

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
What the fuck

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
What the fuck

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
What the fuck

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
What the fuck

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
He ate your mama's pussy

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
With a squeeze of lime

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
The alumni time is here

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
It's time to ask him questions

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
It's time to make investments

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Into your future

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
By gaining wisdom

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
His come

34:25.000 --> 34:36.000
Is probably frothy

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
Talk more about the alumnus's cump

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
My name is Dan Harmon

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
I'm pretty charming

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I don't need to introduce myself

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I'm going to bring my best friend

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Off the shelf

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
He went to your school

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Called my ad

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
He's not in the Chinese triad

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
But if he was

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
That would be fine

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
His balls have fuzz

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
So do mine

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Damn it

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
I know

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
But I'm going to keep it clean

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Because his mom's going to be there

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Too much shoe leather

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
That's his heart

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I hope this is the rest of the podcast

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
It could be

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Why not

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
You want a different beat

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
You like that one

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
You want to be one of these

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
You want to try something else

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
It might open up the cans here a little bit

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Let's try this one

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Yo

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
About to come to the stage right now

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Someone that made Milwaukee

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
On the map

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Burr

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Than it was before

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I'm not going to tell you

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
His name until the end

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Of this freestyle rap

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
By me

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Dan Harmon

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Yo

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Milwaukee is a city

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Sitting on the river

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
It's kind of shitty

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Fuck

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
God damn it

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
I can't

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
I can't

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Okay

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Just start it

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Use that same track

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
From the beginning?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Okay

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Here we go

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
This one's real

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
You're sitting at my ad

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
And then the screen comes up

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
Use Milwaukee's awesome city motto too

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
When you get a chance

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
Because I adore the Milwaukee city motto

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Sup

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Milwaukee's generated

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
Very many fine specimens

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Of human being

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
George Clooney

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
I assume

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Don't look it up

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Myself

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
MC Harmon

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
And the man that's about to take the stage

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
My name is Dan

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Dan

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
And I'm about to bring the master of Milwaukee

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
And he is

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
A great person

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
From a great lake

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
His credentials

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Are not fake

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
He went to my ad

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
That's the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
And God damn it, fuck you

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
His name is Rob Schrab

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
But don't applaud yet

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Because the job ain't done

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
I'm gonna rap and then run

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
And introduce him

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
His dick is so big

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
It's got gluten in it

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
He's fine arts

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Major did fine arts

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
No, he didn't

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I think he majored in graphic design

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
And then he created Skud

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
God damn it, I fucked up

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
I fucked up

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Can we do just one more?

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
I swear to God, one more

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
I've got nowhere to be, man

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I'm having the time of my life

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I actually gotta be somewhere in 20 minutes, so

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
For real?

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
No

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
You gotta go back to get some cup

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Get some sweet cup and going on

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Sweet cup and cakes

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I'm gonna cup the shit out of you later, Spencer

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Here we go, you ready, Dan?

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Just Dan, let it fly

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I know, but I can't be profane

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Yeah, don't be profane

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Just let it just go

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Be yourself

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Yo

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
I'm here to introduce

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
The most important man that ever came out of Milwaukee

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
It's not me

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
It's my best friend

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Rob Schrab

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Yo

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Yo

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Schrab

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Yo

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Schrab

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Yo

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Schrab

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
S-C-H-R-A-B

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Milwaukee is the place you want

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
To be from

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
This is the shittiest rap, I can't do it

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
You got it, you got it

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
God damn it

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
God fucking dammit

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I can't fucking do it

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
You wanna try another beat?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Yeah, give me one more beat

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
I'm sorry

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
This is good

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Okay

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
This is the one, this is the one

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Yo

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Yo

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Yo

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
A great place

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
By a great lake

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Rob Schrab's coming to the stage

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
He's not fake

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
He's got his credentials from M-I-A-D

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
You're gonna see

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
He's the man to see

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
You're gonna ask him some Q's and A's

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
He's gonna soak up Milwaukee's rays

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Get the vitamin D from the sun's always shining

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Fuck, graphic design and I could have said

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
God damn it

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Oh yeah

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Alright, alright, alright

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Yo

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Ain't no joke

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
He's gonna come out

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Fuck, fuck

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
One more, one more, one more

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
You just gotta do a good job

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
You had to sign it right there

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
You ready?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Yeah

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
I don't think

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Yeah, clean entrance, make it clean

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Clear frame

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Here we go

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
You know, for five dollars a month

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
You can watch Dan to clear frame

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
For our subscribers, here we go

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Yo

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
What's up

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Brew City

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Yo

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
You ain't shitty

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
To me

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
A great place

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
By a great lake

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
But now I'm bringing up the man

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
For God's sake, he's my best friend

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
That went to your hometown with you

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
He went to my ad

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
So what you're gonna do

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
You're gonna ask him questions

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
And learn some stuff

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
I ate your mama's muff

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Last night

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Sorry

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Fuck

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Okay

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
No, here we go

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
S-C-H-R-A-B

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
He is the man to see

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Get some wisdom from him

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
He's about to start coming now

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Right up to the stage

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
He's the man that gave my ad

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
All its rage

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
And all its glory

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
And all its passion

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Don't talk to me about

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Crashing a party

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
When you're supposed to be home

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Drawing

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Do your homework

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Rob Schrab

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Ladies and gentlemen

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Rob Schrab

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Here he comes

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Rob Schrab

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
Here he is

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Let me do one

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
So save that one

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
And then

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
I'll get one more

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
I thought the mama's muff was good

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
One more

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
But then I also have to do one

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
In case he can't use the rap at all

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I'll do one where I just say stuff

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
You want to beat?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Yeah

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
Okay

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Yo

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
No

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Yo

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Oh

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Yo

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Oh

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
My name is Dan Harmon

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I come from Milwaukee

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
But I'm not there for tonight's

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
walkie-talkie today

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Fuck, what?

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
I had the horrible feeling

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
you were going to say Bukaki

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
Yo

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
Yo

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Yeah

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Yo

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Yo

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Yo

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
Yeah

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
My name is Dan Harmon

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
I come from Milwaukee

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Rob Schrab's coming out

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
like Bukaki

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
in a minute

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
He's fucking at you asshole

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Jeff Davis put that rhyme in my head

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
But now I'm introducing

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Rob Schrab instead

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
He's my best friend

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
for about 30 years

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Is that how old we are?

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
But we started drinking beers

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
where you are

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
right there

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
in your hometown

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
But when Rob Schrab was home

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
he was down

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
in the basement

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
drawing robots and shit

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
and that's why he's here

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
get over it

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
He's the

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
super alumnus

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
You should

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
You're going to be glad

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
you've come to this

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
You're going to ask him questions

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
and stuff

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
and

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I'm not going to say

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
muff

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Here he comes

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
to the stage

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
He's the Milwaukee Institute

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
of Art and Design's Bridge

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
He's the most famous dude

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
The most powerful

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Not that those things matter

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
but here you go

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
You're going to

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
get a taste of

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
what makes him great

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
and ask him

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
really important questions

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
for God's sake

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Don't just say

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
can I have a job

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
because you can't

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
So here he comes

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
with his special pants

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Rob Schrab

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Yeah, we got that one

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
That's the one

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
So we'll give him

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
that one

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I think the faculty

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
and the parents

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
that attend that

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
are going to be happy to know

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
that the special guest

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
is coming on stage

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
like Bukaki

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Alright

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
So

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Alright

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Means a lot

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Okay

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Hello Milwaukee Institute

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
of Art and Design

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
I'm Dan Harmon

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
I'm also from Milwaukee

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
I did not go to your school

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
I went to Marquette

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
for a little bit

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
and then I dropped out

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
but

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Schrab

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
I shouldn't say his name

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
I should save it for the end

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Okay, take two

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
Alright, Marquette

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Yo

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Yo

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Yo

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Yo

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Ask to the C

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
to the H-R-A-B

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Coming to the stage

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
is the man you want to be

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
If you stay in school

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
and major in graphic design

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
the Milwaukee Institute of Art

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
and Design

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
It's not that

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
It's not cheating to rhyme

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
design with design

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
if that's the name of the school

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Rob Schrab is the man

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
you need

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
to ask questions of

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Alright

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Obviously I'm not going to

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
just suddenly do a good rap

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
We thought for a second

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
I would

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Alright, here we go

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
So here's the verbal one

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
Okay

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
I'm going to kill myself

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
I'm going to walk off stage

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
and just hear a gunshot

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
and the birds are going to

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
start singing again

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Alright

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Hello

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Are you an artist?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Or is your son or daughter one?

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Or is your child

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
non-gender binary?

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
Starting over

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Stay on target

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Stay on target

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Hello Milwaukee

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
Thanks for voting for Trump, you fucks

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Yeah, I was going to come back

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
and visit too

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
but I had socks to sort

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
You fucks

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
I know Milwaukee probably

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
didn't vote for him

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I'm sure it's a blue island

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
and a big dumb red state

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Alright, here we go

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Butter emails

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Alright

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Hello Milwaukee

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Institute of Art and Design

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
I did not go to you

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
but I did live in your city

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
My name is Dan Harmon

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
and I have become famous

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
But I'm about to introduce

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
somebody even more

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
important than myself

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
He's the reason why

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I went to Los Angeles

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
on a U-Haul

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
with only my mattress

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
and a pile of hustlers in a crate

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
and now I'm so glad

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
that I followed him

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
and listened to him

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
He always had the best advice

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
for me

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
Every single time I ever asked him

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
for any feedback on a screenplay

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
or how to solve a problem

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
his advice throughout my entire life

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
was always the exact right advice

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
I only kept failing

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
because I very often forgot to follow it

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
He's a really, really, really special

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
really smart guy

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
and he went to your school

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
and he benefited from all it has to offer

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
so I think this is going to be

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
a great evening for you

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
Sorry, I can't make eye contact with you

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
Please welcome back to your

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
Institute of Art and Design

47:03.000 --> 47:10.000
Mr. Rob Schrab

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
Okay, alright, good enough, right?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Yeah, that was good

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Alright

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I almost did this one

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Should we play D&D?

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
I think it's a bit early, right?

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
Well, I mean, I guess that doesn't...

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
No, Dan, just rap for 90 minutes

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
I get that

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Don't give me raw

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I'm not saying that the rapping segment was short

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I have little tears in my eyes right now, Dan

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
That was exciting

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
Well, can I do one rap now that doesn't have to be clean?

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
You can do all the raps you want

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
I feel like...

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
Do you feel any difference

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
rapping to the lack of audience?

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
Or is that not a factor?

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
I don't know

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
I mean, have I ever been good?

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
You have your moments when you really lay it down

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
Yeah, well, let's see if we can create some

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
without the audience

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Zach, what's that beat you got?

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Let's do something new

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
You got a beat you can lay on us, or is that going to be hard?

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Yeah, I like when you DJ

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
because you got the goods

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Zac McKeever, everybody, on audio

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Alright

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Yo

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Oh, no

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Oh, shit

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Here we go

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
Yo

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
About to spit fire

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Droppin' science takin' me higher

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
My rap is a function of biology

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Fucked your mama so hard, it was Scientology

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
A clear to teetons off her neck

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Fucked her, rolled her over, heck

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Said to your mama, go back to church

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Fucked your mama, like her name was Lurch

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
From the Adams family, got a hand in a box

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Going up into your mama's socks

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Puttin' him inside out like the pantyhose

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Fucked your mama, cause that's the way it goes

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Fucked your mama, cause that's the way it goes

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Fucked your mama, cause that's the way it goes

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Went to the garage, built a canoe

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Cause that had nothing else to do

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
It's the new hobby that I'm pursuing

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I fucked your mama and started chewin'

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
On her labia, but not hard

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Just a nibble, just a tiny, did love nibble

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
She asked for it

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
She likes it

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Went up to the attic

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Fucked your mama, she was ecstatic

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Said, go get the handcuffs

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Fucked her so hard, she had dandruff

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Fucked her with her phone

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Fucked her with her phone

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Fucked her with her follicles

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
With my dick

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Made her hair retain more grease

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Cause of my dick

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Fucked your mama, seven ways

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Fucked your mama for 19 days

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Fucked your mama, didn't drink any water

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Fucked your mama, made two sons and a daughter

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Sent them to school, paid for their education

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Fucked your mama all across the nation

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000

Fucked her in North America

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000

56:00.640 --> 56:05.040
leavey did you know that's Kumail Nanjiani is today's people magazine hot guy

56:05.040 --> 56:09.480
of the day oh yeah I think puts him in the running for the hottest man of the

56:09.480 --> 56:13.760
year oh are they picking 365 I don't know I don't know how the whole thing

56:13.760 --> 56:16.880
works but there's a picture of him having breakfast in bed with leather

56:16.880 --> 56:23.440
leather pillows and he's got like grapes and three cocktails and he's looking

56:23.440 --> 56:31.520
good well he'll probably handle that well what do you mean now you know he

56:31.520 --> 56:34.720
last time he was on the show he came out with a crown on his head and he didn't

56:34.720 --> 56:39.160

56:43.160 --> 56:51.000
famous and than one of your friends it's not it's it's I'm not jealous I it

56:51.000 --> 56:57.160
just hurts to see other people succeed that's what can you delineate the

56:57.160 --> 56:59.600
difference between jealousy and I don't know I think it's some kind of

56:59.600 --> 57:02.920
condition I have I just experienced physical pain when other people succeed

57:02.920 --> 57:10.000
so it's not jealousy jealousy is a bad quality you just can't enjoy your

57:10.000 --> 57:15.720
friends doing well I do enjoy it but it hurts it hurts it physically hurts me

57:15.720 --> 57:25.120

57:33.920 --> 57:38.160
what he's being bashful like you know he's getting Steve 60 seconds to talk

57:38.160 --> 57:50.240
about whatever subject or subjects he would like no one else talk so the the

57:50.240 --> 57:58.320
Miami Hurricanes one yesterday oh yeah there you go it was a it was a big

57:58.320 --> 58:04.080
rivalry I think the Catholics versus convicts you guys know about that

58:04.080 --> 58:11.040
yeah I saw that documentary that 30 for 30 yeah yeah yeah and a Miami

58:11.040 --> 58:15.720
Hurricane and we've stomped out Notre Dame so you're a convict I'm a convict

58:15.720 --> 58:19.200
yeah today so did they own that or is that totally bullshit like they did it

58:19.200 --> 58:23.280
like they kind of embrace that embrace it like even the even the announcers

58:23.280 --> 58:28.280
during the game or like that's great mentioning it yeah is it Notre

58:28.280 --> 58:32.520
Damien said yeah yeah and every so they invented this thing this year or every

58:32.520 --> 58:36.840
turnover which is like where they force change of possession yeah the change of

58:36.840 --> 58:40.920
possession so when the other team has the ball and they intercepted or recover

58:40.920 --> 58:48.480
a fumble whatever player forces the turnover the turnover they get this

58:48.480 --> 58:55.000
giant golden chain with the you on it the turnover chain and then they wear it's

58:55.000 --> 58:59.560
like eight pounds or something during the game during the game no no they don't

58:59.560 --> 59:02.520
wear it on the field but they wear on the sideline and they're like they get

59:02.520 --> 59:08.080
their moment yeah that's awesome yeah and you ever check out a 30 for 30 30 for

59:08.080 --> 59:13.480
30 yeah you might like it it's the narrative part of sports not the sports

59:13.480 --> 59:17.440
part yeah that's true yeah I'm watching the one I'm halfway through the one

59:17.440 --> 59:20.880
about Rick flair have you watched that one that sounds really interesting it's

59:20.880 --> 59:24.440
yeah it's called nature boy and it's really good because I didn't know that

59:24.440 --> 59:28.280
much about Rick flair and what his life was like but like I don't know he I mean

59:28.280 --> 59:32.360
he's still with us and he still he still looks like Rick flair but like he like

59:32.360 --> 59:37.640
there's there's still teams that in their war in their locker room warm-up

59:37.640 --> 59:43.000
chant like his like ring banter like when he would come into the ring and grab

59:43.000 --> 59:47.240
the microphone they quote Rick flair that's how much of an impact he had on

59:47.240 --> 59:54.200
like sports as celebrity right now he's like a yoga guy right don't spoil it for

59:54.200 --> 01:00:00.240
me Spencer Rick flair was the guy who his catchphrase was whoo whoo that's the

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.760
kid but you go like I'm the wheel and dealing kiss stealing you know like

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.160
glockenspieling he didn't say that when I made that up but I would that'd be

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:12.080
amazing if he was glockenspieling because catchphrases hadn't been you know

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:17.280
that the industry wasn't in full swing yet well you had your catchphrase could

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.400
just be whoo you've already had Muhammad Ali he was certainly standing on

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.480
Muhammad Ali shoulders and he kind of I think not ripped him off but certainly

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:30.800
was doing his his silver-haired riff on that but yeah he was you know just like

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.760
cheating on his wife all the time and doing you know like like drinking a lot

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.840
and wrestling a lot and saying woo a lot but it's a good documentary what do you

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:46.600
guys do when you go home at night like every night video games and sleep or

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:52.080
emails or something like that church and I'll get in the couch and we'll watch

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.360
like chop junior and fucking yellow the TV oh yeah chop junior so much better

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:00.000
than chopped it's not even funny is that the one with the kids yeah so my

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.760
brother you know they do fantasy sports like fantasy football and say they

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:10.000
draft in the beginning of the season all these friends go in and they get I

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.560
think five kids and they all put money in and then it's whoever's kid ends up

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:21.600
winning gets the pot I'm not a fantasy sports fan I don't do that but I could

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.960
get down on that yeah it's great we have a blast they all get around they watch

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.360
the episodes together or yelling at each other when the kids are like screwing

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.880
up cooking and stuff I feel like you guys are having more fun living than me

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.920
like here okay Dan I agree what do you do when you don't have fun either well I

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.760
just want Cody and I we like we just like being together we watch we if we

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.160
watch something we'll watch like a true crime thing but there are no we'll just

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.080
listen to one of a list of podcasts and things but yeah that sounds really

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.880
boring spending time with loved ones I'm just saying I'm not talking about you

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.760
guys are having more fun I guess I mean like you guys seem like you're in a

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:02.680
better mood than me that's what I meant tonight like like lately you know like

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:07.960
I've been I've been I've been feeling like like with very little variation like

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:15.120
I've been like like getting closer and closer to just like I just just about

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:21.160
the world I'm just so deeply cynical like yeah yeah but I feel like you've been

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:27.680
pretty good yeah I feel like you've been in a good place well I think well

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.280
there's an irony there though that's like kind of deceptive because I think I

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.440
truly like I've kind of given up on humanity so once you've done that you

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:39.200
get in bad moods less because you're like oh you're not you're they're not

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.880
letting you down anymore and you're not like striving to accomplish anything I'm

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.200
just like oh I live on a planet of fucking drooling babbling animals I know

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.960
that I'm in a worse mood generally lately than I have been probably ever and

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:56.560
I don't know if that's just the ravages of time or the or the the fact that we

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.400
have a moron a literate douchebag president and who constantly every day

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.800
makes us embarrassed to be alive I have a theory slash rant about like I don't

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:10.320
know you know we've learned so much about psychology recently you know for

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.240
the longest time we haven't understood psychology and sociology on the level

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.960
we have and like trauma and how that impacts the brain and stuff but you

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.400
know there's obviously been human atrocities and terrible tragedies and

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.600
trying times through all of human history and stuff but I don't know how

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.800
often we've been able to really think about it on that level I wonder if you

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.640
know this sort of stuff has an effect on people historically like if you went

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.400
back to I don't know like the Great Leap Forward or something or Holocaust

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.960
times if people weren't also feeling like that you know just generally more

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.720
agitated more at odds with people I wonder if that's something that's

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.400
happening if I would say it probably certainly does like it's like a low-grade

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:56.880
if you look like this giant protest and all those Nazis at 50,000 fucking yeah

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:04.720
that's an unhappy world saying fix it fix it fix it wait where was it what do

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:09.080
you talk about Warsaw six Poland yeah that's when I really checked out man I

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:13.480
saw I was like is like are you fucking kidding me I'm Polish like I like like

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:19.840
races pull it pull it pull Polish people are we're the original Nazi victims I

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.600
mean we're like like we were getting picked on like like my ancestors fled

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:30.880
that shit like it it's like it's fucking it's fucking insane the entire city of

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.680
Warsaw was bombed into oblivion that I guess I've just probably not more than

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:41.280
a couple buildings that are still standing pre-1940 you know for the

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.840
whole place just got annihilated it just makes me check out you know like I

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.200
don't I don't there's nothing it's just so much bigger than all of us you know

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:54.640
it's so it's so inexorable and so you just want to go well shit I should have

01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:00.120
I should have spent the last year you know sticking to my elliptical and

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.960
actually like building a doomsday shelter and all this stuff because it's not

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:08.120
gonna take it's not it didn't happen overnight so it kept snapping back out

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:13.600
of it and going things will be okay but like it's just like the truth is or at

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:19.360
least feels like that it's like okay we're on like a five-year slide into

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:24.560
hell on earth in one form or another whether it's nuclear annihilation or

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:31.880
just like fucking like total like global fascist

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:40.480
coups resulting in like a crazy like I can't tell which is gonna be worse like

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.320
the war version of it or the peace version of it where but like in any case

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:50.520
like just like the definition of inhumanity like getting so much harder

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:55.840
to meet in other words like atrocity becoming more and more tolerable and

01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:01.640
people pulling back more and more like I just like I saw that those that photo

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:07.080
of Poland like it's just like it looks like Mordor just out yeah I can't what

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:11.800
I was supposed to do throw a tin can at it like what how am I supposed to brush

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:18.320
my teeth why why how can I give a fuck like the people have spoken like they

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:30.320
don't they want to die all right so I don't have anything currently they sat

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:37.000
next to a 73 year old lesbian woman I saw this this is good this is good at the

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.760
bar on where our flight was delayed and she was a heavy she was just she started

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:46.040

lime thing she heard me on the plane like making a big deal out of it and but

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.840
the guy in the plane did you hear the guy I go I go I go no lime and you guys

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:59.920
like uh-huh yeah and I go no lime and he goes like yeah and I go like I can't

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.160
stress this enough no lime and he's like alright and then when he brought brought

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.480
me the he heard your raps about how many pushes you ate with a little bit of

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:11.280
probably the drink back and he goes like did someone on this flight give you a

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.220
lime like he like like giving me two to psych motherfucker like no no not this

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:19.800
flight what do you got you what do you got flight patriotism someone in your

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:24.720
fucking airline every goddamn time the further the flight out there like this

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:33.320
is what happens every no no no lime and then come back I got a shish kebab of

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:40.960
limes like steep like swished around and I said I said I go I go I go I go I cut

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.400
you got it I said no lime as she goes oh it's all I heard was lime okay all right

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:54.080
look language doesn't work that way all I heard was lime if all I heard was now

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:58.640
boarding and I just decided to get on the plane you'd fucking beat my ass like

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:03.160
you did that one guy when you wanted to make money like like like like you you

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:08.240
expect me to hear more than the words that I feel like hearing fuck you United

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.640
Airlines fuck you you fucking fuck all airlines fucking cartel especially there

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.720
I got I got I got found someone to be angry about but the guys like so he was

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.800
just like did someone is that like the the offense like why are you offended

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:23.000
I'm the fucking victim here man I'm the one that's getting limes putting all my

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.720
shit all the time I'm the fucking lime lime guy you're not you just a dude

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.560
that's like wondering why I really need you to know no lime in it you fuck whenever

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.440
I get soda like I always ask for just the can and not the glass because if you

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:40.640
ask for the glass they'll just put like four ounces of soda and then keep the

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:44.200
can and then they never do that and it's like you're you're not even going

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:48.240
somewhere else you're just reaching in to grab a can and I don't know I hate

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:54.080
restaurants that like you when you order delivery and they have Diet Coke on

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.240
their menu and then they you order a Diet Coke like that sounds great and they

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:04.800
they they bring you a taped up ass fucking plastic thing filled with ice it's

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:10.600
like probably represents like two ounces of of actual Diet Coke from a soda

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:15.040
fountain instead of a can give me a can of Diet Coke taped up well yeah they

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.040
tape it up because you know so it doesn't spell because they have to put all

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:25.240
this effort into saving money just give me a can of Coke you knobs yeah church

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.120
points out like there are things to be happy about what you were you were you

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.280
heartened at all but the fact that we like on these last election with people

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:37.000
yeah you know that's what seek trans people lesbians black lives matter

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.760
people that's a 73 year old lesbian and I did talk about like I but I honest I

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.480
have to be perfectly honest with you I I I the timing of this is like I was I was

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:50.680
checked out like I wasn't I wasn't there for that victory mentally I I heard

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.280
about it third hand you know like like after the fact because I wasn't

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:58.080
following it I wasn't rooting for anything I wasn't I wasn't invested I

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.400
was like numb but that is great to hear it is and it's great to hear that that

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:09.080
guy molested a 14 year old that's it is great so did you see the guy the guy

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.880
with the I retweeted that guy with the hammer yeah I mean I feel like I stole

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.120
your your no it's because I like I just go I'm not doing any jokes I just I'm

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.040
just so angry like I got so many really telling it people all the time this is

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:27.200
about the guy taking a correct yeah it's the thing that he bought correct has his

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.920
money here's my question he took a hammer out which is the least which I

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.000
believe I want to know I'm trying to piece together the narrative like I want

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.520
to take out index cards and with each fact that we know because one of them is

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.840
that he owns that machine one of them is that he I won't say what wants to

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:48.320
you know loves fucking children like but he he he we won't go that far but but

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.320
we know that love supports Hannity like they so that's one index card and then

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:57.120
he said yeah so I was thinking like is this is did it become his favorite show

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:01.720
because of the the child fucking support or or was it already his favorite show

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.560
and then and then and then he saw and then Hannity came on the episode was

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.880
like I think that it's okay that this guy fucked a kid or tried to fuck a kid

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:14.600
tried to fuck four kids it's fine it was 40 years ago and hey look kids are kids

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.120
they like they know what they're doing and they know what they signed up for when

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.960
they turned 14 and and the guy was like watching it and he was like fucking a

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.920
finally like a show that's talking my language and then the commercials came

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.560
out and the coffee maker commercial came out and said like wouldn't you like a

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:33.200
delicious cup of curgan coffee and Cougar Cougar Cougar Cougar Cougar ran coffee

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:38.240
and he was like fuck I like I do I love coffee or he hates coffee but he went

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:42.120
out and was like I want to support the sponsor yeah and then and then he brings

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.560
it home and he's like sipping it he's like I'm not even a coffee fan but I

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.640
got it I just love fucking kids and then and then and then the and then he saw

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:55.440
the news and he's like god damn it some guy I made a joke like a tweet about like

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:59.880
you know I've always refused to make coffee out of any machine that by a

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:06.520
company that isn't 100% independent affiliate and then some guy responded

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:10.000
and logically whoever it is I did block him because I read some of his other

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.960
stuff and I didn't dig it but but what he said was fine to start a conversation

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:20.400
but I just know where the conversation is going to lead and it was a oh so if I

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.160
accused you of molesting me when I was 14 you wouldn't want your friends and

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.600
family to presume you innocent and protect you until blah blah blah blah

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:30.080
nice to know if you didn't say the nice to know thing I might have I might have

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.520
replied and like not instantly blocked him but the thing is like your

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.760
presumption of innocence thing yes of course everyone's presumed innocent I

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.480
mean it's innocent so it's presumed innocent until until proven guilty but

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:47.160
not Obama was he was he was he admitted it he admitted it they're like here's

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.120
these kids that coming forward the saint he touched me he goes on television I

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.760
never dated any daughters underage without their mother's permission that's

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:59.920
admitting he admitted it like it's not even alleged he fucking did it and he

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:05.120
didn't buy anybody any beers yeah no but that's saying I did it yeah but like

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:11.080
people are saying oh he admitted it like we Bill Cosby hasn't been proven

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:16.800
guilty 9,000 women said he raped him I was me hasn't admitted it yeah you go

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:25.960
yeah but exactly to his credit he's a fighter listen if you take one lesson

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:32.400
away from tonight show okay but does Keurig make money off the K-Cups I

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:37.760
thought any company can make K-Cups and they make the machine right so so they're

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.640
not continuing to make dollars after the purchase because you get your K-Cups

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.160
from you know anyway he could have gotten K-Cups from a pedophile company and

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.600
and actually really stuck it to Keurig yeah somebody I don't know who it is

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.640
somebody if you could find it on my Twitter replies to that tweet I forget

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.920
who it is someone said that that's why I get all my coffee from chock full of

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:03.080
Nambla I was a chock full of underage nuts the thing that I think is really

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:10.560
funny is is the idea of of boycotting a company for pulling its sponsorship I

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:14.840
think that's really funny like because we're not really that's that's it's

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.560
already too complicated if you want you don't think the company already did the

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.760
math on this like like they're the ones with the most at stake you're so dumb

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:27.440
you're smashing your own property thinking it's punishing someone they they

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:33.480
have accountants like and PR people like they crunched the numbers and said look

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:37.880
I wish we weren't in this situation but the truth is we make a penny more in the

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:43.080
long run if we don't sponsor the pedophile show and but but also the

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.600
funny thing about it is like you're punishing you're punishing the free

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.360
market you're punishing like you're punishing like a company just going just

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.480
not doing anything you're just like they're going like well we just don't

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.360
want a lot of people's be pulling our sponsors a lot of people's beef is that

01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:01.160
that it's it looks like the optics of it looked like that courage pulled their

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:06.880
sponsorship after tweets like yeah so so so say they did how the fuck do you

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.840
want a corporation to behave that's what I mean liberal liberals aren't this

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.320
insane you know like there's a lot of dumb liberals like like like 85% of

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.240
everybody's overreacting to everything at all times but it's but it's just like

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:24.680
they imitate the right imitates the left and it's like just bizarre but they

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.520
don't understand it's like you really you realize that they're sociopaths

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.960
because you go like you don't understand anything then because like it's

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:36.080
different to say oh these it was like like this is the list of sponsors for

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:39.880
this thing that we don't like okay uber you're you're in the crosshairs we're

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.520
not gonna take uber okay everybody I'm deleting my uber app here's a video of

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:47.760
me deleting it hey don't don't sponsor uber because uber sponsors this thing

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.280
and then you wait for uber to cave or no cave and then like this idea of because

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:57.080
they don't they don't even have that they can't go to shows that aren't

01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:01.680
supporting pedophilia and that's a like I'm gonna stop using your ride

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.320
shared service until you support that's why Jeff's joke is so perfect because

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.360
what are you trying to say other than I only support companies who defend

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:16.360
pedophilia monetarily yeah I mean it's pretty insane I is insane I only want

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:20.080
coffee but you everyone should have the right to defend pedophilia and make me a

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.680
delicious cup of coffee right it's a it's an absurd position but that's their

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.600
espouse position so either admission I love people throwing their their

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:32.040
expensive machinery off of a landing it like under the sidewalk and it's like

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.960
it's not heavy enough to be dramatic yeah also the guy's hammer thing it's like

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:40.040
there's a lot of internal cuts and that's a lot of internal edits so you can

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.840
make it look like magic they had to go shit I need a I need some water like I

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.120
gotta hydrate this is taken forever like there's a lot of internal cuts with a

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:51.160
thing keeps moving around and yeah that guy bothered to reply to me after I was

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.720
like you know aren't you supposed to be using a bat what's with the goggles and

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.840
then he was like I was trying to show how silly something is or like something

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:03.040
like that like he was being ironic about it but he wasn't because all he was

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.320
talking about is how it was alleged and we can't do this but then he was saying

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:11.640
he was making a joke it's like you're clearly not making a joke I could hit

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:16.520
him wearing sandals and socks and and and a helmet yeah that's the you want

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.960
shoes if you're gonna be hammering something at your feet you don't need

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.880
fucking a hard hat what's gonna fall on your fucking head I just also love the

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:27.840
idea I'm so mad boycotts don't work by you throwing out the thing that you

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.200
already paid for I know I mean that was the Starbucks boycott was the same

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:35.840
thing you're gonna say Merry Christmas we're gonna fucking buy coffee all of

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:40.000
it capitalism doesn't work when you demand the corporations pay fealty to

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.720
your ideological agenda it doesn't it doesn't make any sense like that it's

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:49.040
a boycott is a is a reaction when you when you're you're you're you're

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:53.480
protesting a company you're trying to say let's hit them where it hurts in

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:57.120
their wallet so you go to the sponsor and say we are not going to support your

01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:00.800
company as long as you continue to make it financially possible for this person

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:07.400
to blah blah blah that makes sense nothing makes sense about the idea that

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:14.040
that coffee company is supposed to feel bad or punished for not doing something

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:19.360
they don't feel like doing like they they stopped advertising during the show

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.960
because so you're saying like from now on it's important the corporations really

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.720
toe the line it's important that they they they they they like so so you're a

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:32.320
communist you're a fucking like what are you right like you're not a capitalist

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.600
you're not you're aren't you gonna be lecturing me about the free market two

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.440
days from now isn't this whole thing about fucking money you suck at business

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.600
you're an idiot you think we're gonna we're gonna make money as a country at

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:50.440
a world where you demand coffee machines love pedophilia or else that you

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:55.760
should demand that they like coffee brother because otherwise the country's

01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:00.760
gonna go broke man like like like like it just done I don't I can't do it

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:05.040
anymore I'm gonna fucking shoot my dogs and then myself your dogs will be fine

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.520
no well I'll shoot myself let my dogs eat me like in Gerald's game yeah I mean

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:13.040
the dogs will be fine then they'll then they'll just die or go feral and you

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.400
know kick ass I mean that probably is there probably gonna be fine like

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.560
probably someone Harvey no Nigel will be fine Harvey won't know what the fuck

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:23.160
did you on his own he'll die in it Harvey Harvey won't eat me Harvey

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:27.760
Harvey I'll watch Nigel eat me to the fucking bone Nigel Nigel I think if I

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.560
sleep too late Nigel would start nibbling my ear lobes Nigel's Nigel's

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:39.040
from the streets Nigel's fucking hardcore Echo Park baller he doesn't give

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:43.960
a fuck he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't even it was just nice because when I come

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:48.480
home from a long trip like Harvey you'll like you know like Harvey went

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.500
through a submissive peeing phase like Harvey is very emotionally over all my

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:57.080
shoes like vulnerable and stuff like that Harvey is very empathic when Nigel

01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:02.960
does something wrong and I yell at Nigel Harvey like goes and it's sad for Nigel

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.320
and shit but like that's it's nice though because it's like it has its

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.960
advantages because night I come home from a long trip and Nigel's just like

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.120
just same expression on his face he's just like who are you do you want to

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.160
play fetch you know like it doesn't get it but Harvey yeah Harvey's Harvey's very

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.960
connected is he still eating the crotch out of your meandies yeah I mean he'll

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:25.120
die I've been trained to I take better care of my underwear leave your aunties

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.160
in the air like he's a bear with it with food to hide your stuff like on a high

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:34.520
shelf I put everything up as high as I can yeah that's great yeah I'm glad to

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:39.360
hear that yeah I mean you could just use like drawers like you know where people

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:44.720
put their underwear away all right toss your dirty underwear into some drawers

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:49.160
you guys my mom no I mean that I'm saying that's a bad idea get all your

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.040
clothes oh yeah dirty underwear in the drawer yeah that'd be weird are you

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:57.560
well I have a hamper hamper there you go yeah I wasn't gonna make fun is he

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.680
nefarious enough to get into a hamper do you knock a hamper over to get into

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:04.040
those sweet delicious poopy andies I don't know yeah I don't think he's done

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.560
that yet but sometimes sometimes I swear I'm like I'm like there's no way I

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.000
left these underwear out like like I don't know it's it's there's still like

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.040
plausible deniability though like where maybe I left him on the the bathroom

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:22.240
floor but yeah he he he does some fucked up shit man like he knows it's wrong

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.080
too like he it's so crazy how dogs know exactly what they're not supposed to do

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:30.000
and then they're just it's so weird like you you leave the room and then there's

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.600
like they're up on a counter like eating a bowl of cheese dip and then you

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.520
come in and they're just like crazy in that too like Nigel you can tell a

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.640
difference when he knows he's being observed and when he doesn't think he's

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:45.720
being observed like it's really interesting yeah probably just wants

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:49.320
attention like a naughty child well no he wants to get away with things he

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.960
knows what he'll be you know told him that not to do yeah I had a I I I but

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.560
you Cody's dog is staying with us a lot now Barbara and Cody was gone and I was

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:06.800
just sitting the barbara yeah and and I'm playing Mario and then I hear this

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:12.920
like crash and I think oh god Barbara probably maybe the doggie doors

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:19.120
barricaded Barbara maybe knocked the barricade over maybe she's hurt you know

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:23.800
it's a crash there was I just I was assuming it was coming from one place

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.760
and I walked from the room where I was playing the video game down towards where

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:32.880
I assumed the crash was coming from and along the way I passed my bedroom where

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:37.680
Harvey and Nigel are both going like it's just so funny looking back at it

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.000
because it's like at the time I was like I just noticed it but like wasn't

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.440
thinking that the two of them just had this expression on their faces like

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:49.000
like like like the expression you'd have if you were doing a line of coke at a

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.440
party and somebody like walked in you know they just kind of like we're like

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:57.840
they just had this like weird forced like like casualness to them like they're

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.360
like what's up what's up would you hear something and then I and then I went

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.960
downstairs and there was that the doggie door was fine and Barbara was fine and

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:09.960
then I'm like wait a minute you two and I went up to the bedroom where they were

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:14.440
like like straightening their ties and hanging out as I walked past and it was

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:18.680
like where they hump a fuck did they even do there was like there was a

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.240
picture of me turned over on the nightstand they got like like and there

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:28.160
was a there was a there was a bunch of beverages in in the drawer of Cody's

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:32.200
nightstand and it was just like like they was like they were like I don't know

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:36.960
were they like making a fort or a bomb that was it that straightened really end

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.160
that great but it was like it's just it's just funny that those guys were like

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:48.040
inspiring yeah I like it Steve how's your love life you guys hear about these

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:53.520
Chinese murder fans all right well do what did we did we talk through the D&D

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:59.560
time or no let's discuss as I've been away a while and Brandon he told me he

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:03.280
just texted me and said he turned me into a caterer he was great um he said

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.400
he turned a lot of snacks for us yeah apparently I'm Chad the fire like

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:11.880
her is now Chad the snack bringer yeah there's some beef jerky I don't know

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.160
how can and that was it wasn't beef jerky oh I guess it was beef jerky it was

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:19.320
murr balls was the main thing murr balls which I was it like mur like the

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:25.960
herb or like the the gift to Jesus same thing anyway you know for that bronca

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:31.600
has murdered really yeah yeah I can taste it just thinking about I don't know

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.600
it's so strong it's like they dig oh yeah they gave it to Jesus like an essence

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:39.800
from like a root or a tree and it's like kind of like a very precious sap and

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:45.560
preservative and nice perfume and like kind of a healer kind of thing did I

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:51.400
talk about Floyd the tree whisperer last episode I don't think so there's

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.080
there's shit going down with the the is that the guy that we waited for on Sunday

01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:00.320
the eucalyptus tree is the boot since yeah well it's I mean this is the

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:04.000
remember when she talked about the well-respected arborist or whatever like

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:11.000
yeah I met that guy and he yeah I could swear I talked about this though I feel

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.760
like you did yeah I heard about but I just don't remember if it was on the

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:21.200
show yeah I thought so well this dude came out who looks like a

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.800
teamster in a sleeveless shirt but then I started noticing things like like his

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:35.240
his tattoos were kind of like so I just I hit the mistake that was not well I

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.840
just noticed he had tattoos that says even though he looked kind of

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:41.880
straight laced but then and then also he had like blue nail polish on it with

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:47.360
like yellow moons on the like somebody somebody had spent time on his nails and

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:52.760
then he said he's talking about the tree and how he can tell me if the tree

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:57.080
needs to be cut down which it does because it's dead but then he he needed

01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:02.480
to talk to the tree for a second and as he stepped forward he realized that the

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:08.040
shirt he was wearing was a Gal Gadot Wonder Woman shirt there's just the

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.960
front didn't have anything on it but then the back that was like just the

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:15.560
greatest like reveal that he was wearing this like Wonder Woman shirt the

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:19.840
whole time but he went over to talk to the tree talk to the trees like he's

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:25.520
like this tree is like really sad and dying and dead and like did he put his

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:29.920
hand on it like how does he talk to it yeah I know why I didn't I that was my

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.160
mistake that his but he also showed us that he's like this is dangerous there's

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.240
like this shit on it like this kind of rot that it's like a fungus that grows

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.880
on dead wood and it like if the neighbor's kid like started playing

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.880
with it it could get really sick like it could he said he got he almost died

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.880
once because he inhaled a bunch of it and it like grows a fungus in your lungs

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.880
and stuff and that one a tree attacks that's well this I mean the tree has

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.800
just been dying for him for a long time it's like you know it's hollow you can

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:08.560
I mean it's like the roots aren't even connected to the trunk it's it's just

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.160
this giant eucalyptus tree that's like leaning towards my neighbor's house and

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:17.680
ready to fall on it the $8,000 it will cost to cut it down what do you split

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.640
that I don't know they have a landlord is the way that it will fall over and

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.400
crash into your like like into your house and kill everybody yeah it will it

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.080
will what it will one day fall on my neighbor's house we had to cut down when

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.480
I was a kid I grew up with giant eucalyptus trees in our neighborhood when

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:37.080
I was a little kid in testin and there was like the garage like that side of

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.720
the house and like a five foot gap and then the house and then in between that

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:47.800
was a hill with a giant like you know hundred foot eucalyptus tree this giant

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.800
tree and they cut it down and it fell exactly in between that these these

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:56.160
pros came in and did all this math and all this stuff and check the windage and

01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:00.520
all this shit boom right in between the houses if it had gone a foot either way

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.320
it would have destroyed something yeah I don't think they do like that anymore I

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:07.040
think they do it in chunks yeah and that's why Floyd won't be a part of it

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:13.880
Floyd Floyd said he said I come here to tell you that the tree wants to be needs

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:19.160
to be cut down he's be you know put out of its misery or whatever and I won't do

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:24.760
it myself I won't take that money I won't take that job because I I he said he

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:28.720
characterized it like as he's gotten older he's learned to empathize with humans

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:34.480
almost as much as trees and so he's really worried about the day laborers

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:38.560
that you bring in to like these guys climb up if you if you've ever seen

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:44.200
these people bring down a big tree in Los Angeles it's harrowing yeah I I

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:48.080
understand what he's saying completely I can't believe that anyone asks anyone

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:54.000
to do that job it's insane like they go up with these with ropes and and they're

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.760
just chainsawing shit up there and they're tying things it's just like it

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:02.560
looks like a Cirque du Soleil act but but designed to kill a human and so he

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:08.980
doesn't want any part of that but he demanded that I notify him when we do

01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:12.040
decide to cut the tree down because he wants to come out and do a memorial

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:22.200
service so which I definitely will be like recording I will I will I will not

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:26.440
be mocking it I think I but I will be I will be sharing it with as many people

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.160
as possible cuz I because this guy's definitely very interesting to it that's

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:33.600
pretty pretty weird I kept making jokes and he was just this is one of those

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:39.280
guys it's like my jokes were not landing with this guy you know like I was I was

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.600
like man I feel really bad like because I feel like I'm a party to this because I

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.880
moved into this house and I I replaced the pipes there were clay pipes from

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:54.240
1929 I mean like this tree must have been so excited when I moved in taking all

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:58.560
my nacho shits and stuff and now and then I replaced the pipes with plastic so

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:03.720
it's probably like that's probably part of it you know like I starved it out it

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:08.680
was it was roots were growing into my pipes and causing the sewage to back up

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:17.160
into my bathtub let's play a little this D&D show me all right D&D Dan well

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:23.960
Spencer hands down the the character sheets what was the sound that when

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:27.960
you heard Barbara and Nigel knocking things over like you hear some sort of

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:34.320
crash in the background yeah and I think it was this let it go a little

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:46.160
something like this or maybe when you heard that did you give a did you make

01:30:46.160 --> 01:31:00.440
this response and then and then you go oh I had a lot to eat today so dick just

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:11.000
take a shit this is comedy you cannot find anywhere else this is public

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:21.800
radio level FM I guess not public I mean it's been a bad episode but this is

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:27.800
good this is what the people oh hello Dan Harmon oh shit a dinosaur on the

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:33.280
phone that sound like nobody wants a dinosaur on the fucking I think we

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:37.560
will we need to add the functionality where we can we can have we can just go

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:41.880
to the subscribers and they can ask questions up on the screen and then we

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:50.280
can answer them that'd be great so working on it yeah work harder this is

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:56.120
adventure of passions gem yeah okay okay great so hit the music even though you

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:58.640
sounded less than thrilled about us choosing to go on the adventure of

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.960
passions gem if you'll recall I often sound less than thrilled about most

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:06.040
things kind of your thing yeah cue this guy up all right let's get some music up

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:17.680
here for some Spencer's last time on Harmon quest Harmontown Harmontown oh

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:27.120
yeah I'm a quest is a TV show oh shit up for last time on Harmontown what was

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:32.280
happening our heroes had completed their mission they returned to pure burn keep

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:36.400
to turn it in and they had a debriefing with the guys who took

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:41.880
Patchens to talk to him some more and you guys agreed to meet him and then you

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:47.400
went to the tavern you tried appetizers at the tavern but Diarrhea Jr. could not

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:53.280
be dissuaded by the snacks and instead went to seek out Patchens and he sought

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.600
him out and he found Patchens and Patchens was pissed Patchens was like I

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.080
just want to tell you guys fuck you guys and I'm leaving I gotta handle my

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:07.320
business and fuck you and he left and then Diarrhea Jr. went back to the

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:12.800
tavern and they discussed what to do and I think that Dan might have wanted to

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:16.160
help him and then Jeff didn't want to help him for a while and then Jeff really

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:20.800
wanted to help him and then Jeff went to help him and he summoned a horse oh

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.760
yeah he summoned the horse and he found Patchens and he told him to wait right

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:30.520
there and then he did wait right there and then they all arrived and talked to

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.960
Patchens and after a discussion they agreed to join the quest for Patchens

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:45.720
Jen now damn nice thank you all right so after that was brand Brandon played

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:49.280
Chad the fire like her for a little while but I did a whole lot get done

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:52.520
you guys now you agreed to do the quest and then Geffen showed up and he was

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:57.040
like hey it seems like everyone at this town is on pot or some shit which one's

01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:01.680
Geffen Geffen was the guy that remember he came up on a horse and then he he

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:07.880
threw the prior horse it was white I don't think it was I don't remember but

01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:14.360
he threw he's you'll recall the prior ran away in a combat and Geffen showed up

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.040
and was like yo and then he tossed the prior down to you guys and then he left

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:23.480
and then the debriefing he also just made an appearance right so now some

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:28.120
three of us going on the adventure of Patchens jam right and we're arriving

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:35.680
at this town which is the place where we think the banditos who were actually

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:42.080
disguised as banditos but were in fact gill professional assassins they they

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:45.200
they we were it's pretty clear they came from this town

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:50.200
doorknester it seemed like they did because it was a very nearby town to

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:56.480
the site of burglary and it's a town of roughs and brigands you know the kind

01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:01.000
of people who commit crimes the name of that town is what doorknester doorknester

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.480
and I had and Geffen has left us but I said to him you know let us know if you

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:14.200
notice anything you know if you hear anything about a job that was taken by

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:19.840
any professionals involving way-laying strangers outside of town right you had

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.200
mentioned that to him but I didn't want to tell Geffen too much because we don't

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.880
know if he's a good guy or bad guy and he could be one of those good guys it

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:30.960
turns out to be a bad guy right okay so where do we stand right now we are we

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.760
on foot are we are we in doorknester are we are we are not in doorknester you

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.960
had kind of you would I don't remember exactly you're certainly on the way to

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.360
doorknester so we were pretty close yeah are we are we traveling on foot we've

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:47.200
got a wagon you're on foot alright far as I understand at the crest of a hill

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:51.360
you can see the town in the outlying area below you're kind of yeah you're at

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:55.440
the crest of a hill doorknester is calm and quiet with only a few flickering

01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:00.480
lights visible in the night you can hear soft music as if from a loop that floats

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:06.040
gently into your ears a haunting and mournful harp melody I guess it's not a

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:13.600
loop it's a harp melody coming from the bat valley below you it's a it's it's it's a weird time

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:17.560
it's late in the night so it's a weird time to hear music let's go to the

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:27.520
concert is my my sort of arcane how easy would it be for me to recognize this is

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.680
possibly magical beguiling music you know you have a do you have any ranks in

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:40.840
knowledge okay I listen as close as I can Spencer all right I have only have

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.880
only have ranks in knowledge religion everything else is like checked off but

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:51.680
not I don't have any numbers right um what's your you guys heard my

01:37:51.680 --> 01:38:01.400
intelligence has a mournful melody seven it's certainly amazing music you can't

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:07.080
divine whether or not it's magical it's uh it's highly skilled whoever's playing

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:11.600
it so we don't see who's playing no it's it's coming from really far away it's

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.840
kind of a it's carrying it's kind of repetitive it's kind of a one-note song

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:20.080
sounds like a morning zoo team we got to go we got to see this I love music I

01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:26.240
love live music all right let's check out the music a few more minutes of travel

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:31.960
brings you to the edge of a very curious site a graveyard curious again within

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:37.400
the fence of the cemetery you can see skeletal undead creatures writhing along

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:41.880
around the fence they're kind of inside the cemetery kind of writhing around the

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:45.760
fence the music plays on

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.720
occasionally this is like one of those like Disney books where you press the

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:56.920
button the face um yeah so the skeletal creatures yeah inside the

01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:01.320
graveyard occasionally you can see one of the gravestar gravestones in the

01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:06.560
cemetery topples over you're still far off and nothing's noticed you yet okay

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:12.800
everybody get down so so so want to be clear on this what we're seeing like the

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:15.760
dead rising for that's not why the gravestones are getting toppled over

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:18.760
maybe yeah that's that's kind of what it's looking at and you said they're

01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:22.680
writhing against the fence yeah they're kind of leaning up against the fence but

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.360
they're not like trying to beat it down or anything they're leaning up against

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:29.760
it you notice the cemetery is alive with movement in time with the music you can

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.000
hear thudding and bumping they're dancing throughout the cemetery rumbling

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.720
earth and shaking dew off of grass the the the gravestones themselves are

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:44.280
falling over as graves burst open and new corpses burst forth from the soil they

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:47.640
kind of get up and pull themselves out of the ground and start wandering around

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:52.360
a little bit but after a little tiny bit of wandering around they kind of they

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:57.280
kind of lose interest and just plop down on the soil like take a seat or like

01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:01.000
lean up against something most of them are just kind of hanging out leaning up

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:06.360
against the fences this music is so good that the dead wanted they came back to

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:12.520
life to hear it I was full but mindless this doesn't look like something we

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:21.000
want to just jump into I think we should watch yeah okay do we see where the

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.680
music's coming from no it's a lot louder now that you're by the graveyard but you

01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:27.880
can't tell it's kind of like there's forest around and you can't really pin

01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:33.240
point a location is it still sounds it's night time is it is it to what how it's

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:38.800
called three in the morning misty and foggy so there's absolutely no way to

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:44.760
know we got people rising from their graves getting up walking around for

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:48.800
a second and then just kind of losing interest and hanging out right so

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.840
somebody's summoning the dead out of their out of their graves guys yeah

01:40:52.840 --> 01:41:00.200
Spencer do I have like enhanced hearing do you have perception I have

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:07.000
perception of four you have mildly enhanced do you want to yeah yeah I use

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000
my hearing to see or to listen for exactly where that music's coming from

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:18.720
all right you pinpointed it seems like there's there's a little bit of forest

01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:22.680
interposing the graveyard and the town proper and it seems like it's coming

01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:31.320
from within one of the stands of trees do you guys I right it's I think the

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:37.520
harp is coming from inside those that tree area so we go check it out let's

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.760
let's let's sneak up over there you guys have stuff right I got loads of

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:46.200
stealth this guy's got loads of stealth no no I don't I don't have any stealth

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:51.360
right you're not bone we have a five stealth okay that's good that might be

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:55.040
the best well I think you should check it out because if we don't want to

01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:01.200
bumble over there all right Spence I'm gonna stealthily make my way to that

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.320
tree all right if there's any trouble come running back here okay I'm a

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:10.520
cleric okay dealing with zombies is my thing I just don't these are my

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:15.520
friendly zombies let's not attack them yet we don't have time for this

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.520
conversation they're all chilling and listening to the music man they're being

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:24.800
commanded by someone I did that that person probably has nefarious purposes

01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:32.680
these are there's nothing nice about the undead they just follow orders yeah

01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:38.960
go go sneak up and report back to us okay you attempt to sneak up but almost

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:43.280
instantly you hear the music abruptly stop and then from within the trees you

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:48.920
see a burst of ruby light and then and then nothing it's it's silent again but

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:53.240
the silence is quickly overtaken by the sounds of zombies not being as chilled

01:42:53.240 --> 01:43:00.120
out as they were before oh no the music Ronan making noises how close how close

01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:07.520
are Carlos and I to the zombies how far away do you want to be well I mean pretty

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:15.640
far yeah 50 yards okay I'll say 50 yards but Steve's much closer let's say Steve's

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:20.560
about 20 feet off so you guys are pretty far away kind of spying on Steve and

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:24.200
he's he's up trying to creep he was trying to creep kind of around or past the

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:31.160
graveyard and how far is that ruby light from where I was let's say 60 more than

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:40.400
100 feet oh 100 feet mm-hmm so it's not too far no but yeah it's not too far but

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:44.400
yeah now now the undead are starting to try and climb over the fence they're not

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.040
they're not very coordinated so it's hard and then others are trying to like rip

01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.520
open the fence and break it down if we get bitten by the undead do them no

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.720
okay they just want to kill you and absorb your life essence are they

01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:03.040
coming for us they're certainly do they see us you can't do the yeah you guys

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:06.280
from your vantage point can tell that they can see Steve because he's close

01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.560
but you guys are apparently or it seems far enough away to be evading

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:14.320
detection and how many how many boogins we got right now right now there's eight

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:19.840
eight boogins we can handle eight clumsy boogins are they between me and that

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:24.320
like so I can't run back to no you can you're outside of the graveyard and

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:29.240
they're still inside the graveyard okay so they're not between me and them no

01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:39.960
they're trying to be though oh boy all right I mean in regular Dungeons and

01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:43.440
Dragons as a cleric I would have this power called turn on dead you know I

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:54.360
think you should have it can I see your sheet yeah turn on dead I think under

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:57.680
feats Spencer could I have a different loadout from last time but I've had time

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:05.080
to reset on that yeah absolutely and okay all right fuck it well I'm down if

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:09.360
you are I mean let's do this I got my offensive loadout right now I'm ready to

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:19.720
kick boogin but all right just just does this diary diarrhea looked like he's

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:24.880
any any any danger right now he certainly seems to be like seems to be

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:28.680
close to in danger I mean he's certainly being threatened by undead

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:32.520
they're just not like surrounding him well I said we take I said we go on the

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:35.160
offensive while they're still behind the fence and we can take some potshots

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:41.320
at him yeah we're there's no point stealth well let's just head for Steve

01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:47.960
and help him all right well Steve should go first because he's the closest I'm

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:57.440
gonna go toward the Ruby okay all right you do that you go you can do a double

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.760
move 60 feet all right you get about halfway there if you sprint you could

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:05.600
get all the way there okay I'll sprint there all right you're winded but you

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:14.640
get there you can smell oh it smells like murr and but you don't really see

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:18.920
anything there's no real footprints or anything you can see there is a large

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:24.880
large like stump tree stump like of a tree that's been cut down in recent

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:33.280
history no just like a big old tree stump all right that's your turn one of

01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:42.760
you guys go 50 yards that's 150 feet okay I say we get like in battle

01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:46.240
formation with DJ so that we're close together or is it better to kind of do

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:49.480
get in flanking positions and kind of like kind of have them like because

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:53.920
there is a cemetery a big square enclosure or what is it it's a it's it's

01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:59.360
mostly square it's like a rectangle like how big from side to side 50 feet by

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:04.120
30 feet okay once I get within 30 feet of all of them I have a chance to make

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:09.360
any or all of them flee okay that's what they're still within the bounds I'll be

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:14.000
right behind you and if I need to start throwing fire bolts I'm right behind you

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:24.400
because you know I like fire all right so you're 150 feet away it's gonna take

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:30.080
at least two turns to move into position if you sprint so okay we take that

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:34.440
first sprint all right you do that you're all everyone's winded now it's

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:40.040
great I mean it's tiring but it's great the undead their turn two undead come

01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:43.440
over the fence and are closing in on diarrhea but they're still not to them

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:47.640
yet the other undead there was eight the other six undead break open the fence

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.560
and they're starting to spill out through the side of the fence kind of now

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:59.280
blocking off diarrhea is path to Dan and Jeff so now you're kind of surrounding

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:05.480
them in a way but there's more of them than you so okay now it's a let's let's

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:09.800
let's get these guys in the crossfire how far away from them or am I your 20

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:14.640
feet from the nearest to and they're moving pretty slowly yeah these are

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:24.880
these are slow moving a dead they they move very slowly zombies if you want to

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:29.880
think we can make someone else's no no I want to I want to take out my bow and

01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:38.600
go for some headshots you know from your clerical experience that headshots

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.960
don't kill zombies like in the walking dead they don't one shot at least I mean

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.880
there's still it's damages damage but it's not what do I know well they're

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:50.960
magic so you know you just kind of have to destroy the corpse all right well

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:56.680
then I go for the easiest body part to hit all right Center of Mass what's your

01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:10.200
attack bonus plus five okay time three for a crit what's the damage remember

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:15.800
anyone shit I used to know all this where does it say that oh 128 plus two is

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:28.240
that possible one one D8 one D8 yeah listen then to people read all right

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:36.120
low-key low-key episode yeah whatever you slice one of the zombies in half he

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:42.840
goes down with an arrow oh wait you're shooting him okay my bow you don't you

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:49.880
shoot him it barely affects him damn it oh man well sinks right into his soft

01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:53.720
zombie flesh should use that sword Jack yeah that's what I thought was happening

01:49:53.720 --> 01:50:02.760
my bad that's okay all right Dan and or Jeff take it in well my goal is to get

01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:09.920
within 30 feet of as many of these guys as possible so you can do that but you

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:14.960
can't also act like you can sprint the rest of the way but you can't sprint and

01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:19.720
then yeah yeah well so I'll spend this term positioning myself great you do

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:24.280
that you put yourself into what you think will be exactly the space that the

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:29.280
zombies will be able to move into on their turn okay I guess I guess I do the

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:36.280
same thing it's tactically sound all right the zombies they they come very

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.800
close to you but they can't you know you really measured it right what's our

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:45.400
range right now you're within 10 feet of these guys they've made their move

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.160
until back in our court right they're kind of yeah they're right into your

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:52.880
trap so to speak if you're setting a trap the other zombie who's the other two

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:59.440
zombies who are both not dead come at come at diarrhea they're throwing hands

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:10.280
what's your armor class it should be towards the top left top left oh shit

01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:15.240
they they they stab at you with their bony fingers but it just glances

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:20.720
harmlessly off your your armor it's good armor and they're just zombies so

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:29.200
oh you do see this is something I always forget but as they approach you

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:34.640
you get an attack of opportunity because they entered a space you threaten yep

01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:44.520
opportunity what's your attack bonus for melee for melee yeah like the arrow one

01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:49.960
that you did sorry people for my full attack no for your attack attack just

01:51:49.960 --> 01:52:00.320
one of them when is my phone coming I think stay focused this next week I

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:05.400

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:11.560
can't guys helping me I can't tell you how terrible I feel about it it's I have

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:15.960
an iPhone X and I feel like that's the worst possible outcome like I would

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:20.840
rather you had mine and yours like weeks after you're getting yours then what

01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:25.120
actually happened which is me having one and you not have but it's on Verizon so

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:29.480
maybe that no that is why because the second we could get an AT&T phone it

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:34.720
was two weeks but I did mine after that and it was like launch day Verizon so

01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:39.280
yeah I think it was just AT&T sorry everybody great tangent attack of

half you like that one yeah well it was that was great appropriate sort of like

01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:47.160
like it turned it turned role playing into like a sports event man there's a

01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:51.480
guy who makes an app for this for DMing and he'd be so pissed if we knew he would

sitting all day in your van outside the kindergarten is awful tiresome that's

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:40.200
why I turned to the cool refreshing cup of current coffee if child blood was it

02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:47.000
came out of the faucet this cup we wouldn't need coffee here's to the rest

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:59.800

02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:05.080
we had you guys are having a turn okay there's one zombie left one zombie left

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:11.600

02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:15.400
my knife do it conjures a fire blade oh well I'm riding around on Stuart the

02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:20.440
horse I'm gonna conjure a fire blade and finish the job all right fire blade do

02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:25.920

one day it was one off all right you you slice it right in the neck and it

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:56.960
catches fire holy fire like a silver flame it catches silver flames and the

02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:03.160
silver flames consume it it's like oh yeah it burns to fine white ash it's

02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:07.880
way hotter than a normal fire would be fucking flame blade yeah now I might

02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:10.720
just left holding a flame blade for the next two minutes or what for a couple

02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:16.400
turns yeah okay what happens if you smoke that ash that's you can't just

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.920
muse I kind of want to be like the guy in flesh and blood there's this movie

02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:24.080
flesh and blood with Rutger Howard Jennifer Jason Lee it's like really

02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:32.200
awesome like medieval movie and there's like a cleric kind of guy in it and

02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:42.960
this is my impression of him I see a sign from the gods I see a silver flame

02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:50.120
consuming the rotting flesh of our enemy and I see Chad the fire like holding

02:02:50.120 --> 02:03:00.720
that flame this is our destiny we are here to conquer cliffing we did it

02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:06.000

again let's watch a movie called flesh and blood with Rutger Howard Jennifer

02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:13.560
Jason Lee that was an amazing ending it's a little sexually problematic it's

02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:20.000
kind of like slightly to the misogynistic side of peckingpaw but but it's

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.480
still a really cool movie if you know you don't get enough D&D in movies let's
