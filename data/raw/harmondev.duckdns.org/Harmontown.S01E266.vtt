{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:28.000\nWhat's up Harmontown, hello hello hello, you know I'm gonna start it from here welcome to beautiful uptown Burbank everybody Harmontown is now in session\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:40.000\nSpeaking of special, let's bring out your game master, Spencer Crittenden\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:50.000\nAnd of course if you're a Comptroller, I'm very happy to be back with Jeff Davis\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:54.000\nLet's bring out the man of the hour, the mayor of Harmontown dinner\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:02.000\nThank you, thank you\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:10.000\nNot a lot to talk about tonight, there was a gunman at large in Las Feliz last night\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:16.000\nYeah, I never heard what the denouement of that was\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:32.000\nYeah, well I don't think they caught him and I don't think they ever told anybody what was going on, so I think maybe it was like some kind of soylent green or body snatchers thing like the guy, maybe the guy was, maybe he knew too much\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:36.000\nThey either did or didn't catch him but in either case they can't tell us what happened\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:38.000\nDo you think it was Antifa?\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:40.000\nIt could have been Antifa\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:42.000\nYou're looking very smart and you're in your bright red Cornell hoodie\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:48.000\nThank you, I just got back from Ithaca, New York and they gave me this hoodie\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:54.000\nI thought it was a mistake to give me a women's studies degree, like I don't think, I don't know if I earned that\n\n01:54.000 --> 02:02.000\nBut as Susan B. Anthony says, fuck it, because I didn't earn the degree\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:06.000\nDid they make you an honorary doctor or anything?\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:08.000\nNo\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:16.000\nHow does that work when you get an honorary degree or something? You can't use it for anything, right?\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.000\nIt must be watermarked honorary\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:21.000\nYeah, I think they say honorary\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.000\nYou can't just use it to go get a job\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nYou can try\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nBut red's kind of a nice color on your den, I've never seen you wear bright red\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:29.000\nYeah, I don't wear a lot of red\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nYeah, I like it\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:35.000\nAlso wearing a Cornell hoodie, you look very collegiate\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:39.000\nYou look like you might have just taught poli sci\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:41.000\nYeah, I had a good time at that school\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:43.000\nI guess that's a gig now that I can do\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:48.000\nI hit some kind of tipping point where I can get invited to speak at colleges\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:55.000\nThe ratio of money to labor, which is, well, zero labor\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:00.000\nAnd you're just talking to people that want, I mean, it was just a dude asking me questions\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:05.000\nIt was just like doing this show, but worse, I mean, like not\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:08.000\nIt wasn't as entertaining, but they were eating it up\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:10.000\nAnd you were in that big, beautiful theater there\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:14.000\nYeah, it was a gorgeous theater, everybody was really nice, you know\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nJust laughed at everything I said\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:18.000\nWere they too PC?\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nI hear that's a problem\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:25.000\nNow, nothing of that sort came up really\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:27.000\nIt was just a lot of questions about writing and stuff\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:33.000\nKids, you know, TV is dispersed enough now as an industry\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:40.000\nThere's less money in it, but, you know, now that there's 500,000 places to make television\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:47.000\nIt's kind of satisfying to see these kids are talking about TV like it's carpentry or something\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.000\nYou know, like it's a viable occupation now\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.000\nAnd if it's viable enough, if it's achievable enough\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:59.000\nAnd that's going to mean very quickly, hopefully the representational problems that we have will be, you know\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:08.000\nThose will get sorted out pretty fast as soon as you can actually think about TV writing as a potential job\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:11.000\nThe problem is, how the fuck is it?\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:15.000\nYou're making even less money now\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:19.000\nThere's more places to try to sell your TV show\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:24.000\nSo everybody's questions, they're all taking like these TV writing classes and stuff\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:28.000\nAnd everybody's questions are all, you know, how, what do I do?\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:32.000\nAnd I don't really have the answers for those kids\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:40.000\nI'm not somebody that took a normal path through the system\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nI don't like me\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:45.000\nYeah, you have a show\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:49.000\nI would say you took the most time honored of all the trajectories to get to where you are\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:54.000\nRight, I kept my head down, I just put one foot in front of the other, you know, did the work\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:58.000\nSpencer started running\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:03.000\nYeah, I hadn't really talked about it on the podcast because I didn't want to break the spell\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nBut now I've basically stopped running so we could talk about it\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:10.000\nFor a while Spencer was tweeting there, I jagged 15 miles today and all this shit\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:15.000\nI read those, the first one or two of those I thought was a little bit of irony or like you were being facetious\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nBut no, you're really getting it done\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:21.000\nAnd that was only after I was confident enough in my skills to actually publicize it\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nI was going for quite a while before I was doing that\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nAre you in a treadmill or are you out in the streets?\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\nNo, I was on Griffith Park, out in Griffith Park, running around in a big circle\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nIs that why your back is all jacked up right now?\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nYeah, that's what I think\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nSo your knee exploded, right?\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nYeah, it's no good\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nI'm going to get a drink with you\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:46.000\nThere was a time that I was jogging and then like when I'd be driving my knees would hurt\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nAnd...\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nSo, okay\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:54.000\nOh, for some reason I thought that Chris is making that noise\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nBut it's a sound board\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:00.000\nZac McKeever, our sound guru, told me to get some sound effects because we have no audience\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nThat's a bad fart sound\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nI mean, I guess it's like a free app fart sound\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nThat's a sound? That's a professional sound?\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nSee, that's so bad\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nI'm making a fart sound\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nOkay, I'm sorry\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nNo, it's fine, I'm just insulting you\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nSee, this is bad\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nSee, that one's called nose\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nThat's someone blowing their nose, but that sounds like a better fart, doesn't it?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nRight, yeah, no\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nIt definitely sounds like a better fart\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:30.000\nWe've got to get you some good Foley artists to work with\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:31.000\nOh my god, we do\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:34.000\nYou should get a Foley artist instead of a sound board\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:39.000\nOh my god, we should have full on old timey radio shows\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:42.000\nFoley guys, we can put them under your podium\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nThe story is going somewhere because Spencer hurt his knees back\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:51.000\nYeah, so just while driving it would hurt my knee while I was driving\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:54.000\nAnd then I was like, oh, driving is fucking up my knee and I kept running\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nBut I think that running was fucking up my knee\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:02.000\nAnd I was only feeling it while I was driving until it got so bad that I felt it after I was running\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nAnd then I was like, oh, I bet I'm fucking myself up\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nAnd it was bad\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:10.000\nAnd so then again, it was only hurt when I sit and when I was driving\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nAnd it would be the worst because I drive for work and also I drive for recreation\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:17.000\nI would say I drive between two and three hours a day, most days\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nAnd most of that's just for fun, you know\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nAnd so it got\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nYou just get out on the open road and just\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:27.000\nOh yeah, Blastin' Doughboys, it's a real fun time\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nSo, you went to get\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nWell, I went to the doctor and but the day I went to the doctor\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nThen I started getting what I think is sciatica pain\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:39.000\nWhich is like on the side of your lower back\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:42.000\nYeah, it goes down your ass, cheek and down into your\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:46.000\nYeah, I would feel it right under my ass and then in my foot\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:50.000\nAnd it was like really bad and so I went to see the doctor and he was like, oh, it's just inflammation\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:54.000\nAnd I was like, well, there's this new thing that's coming up and he was like sciatica\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:57.000\nAnd I was like, I don't know what that is and he was like, it's like your legs burning\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nAnd I was like, well, no\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:03.000\nI was like, okay, but then I looked it up after I left and I was like, well, fuck no, that was what I had\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nHe described it wrong, yeah, if he had said a tingling\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nOr like almost like an electrical pain\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nYeah\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:14.000\nGoing shooting down your leg, just starting somewhere in your ass cheek\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nAnd then going down, I had that really bad\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nI thought I was gonna have to live with that forever\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:19.000\nWhat'd you do?\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nNothing?\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nWell, the first thing that fixed it was an inversion table\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:24.000\nOh, right\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:28.000\nAnd then it started coming back and I may have fucked up my back more with the inversion table\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:32.000\nI was evangelizing inversion tables for a while\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:38.000\nThen McGathey had gone to some chiropractor\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nAnd that's Dr.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nGod, his name is Dr. Phil\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nOh, yeah\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:45.000\nOh, no\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:46.000\nAnd he doesn't like inversion tables?\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nWell, no, of course not\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nYou know, Dan, I hear that in the medical community\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nDr. Phil is known as something of a\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:59.000\nOh, yeah\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nIf you want this to be a morning zoo show\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nI've taken the shit to a new level\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nPeople thought when we lost the audience the show was gonna suffer a showbiz once\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nNo, we're reaching untold heights\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nYeah, this is real\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nBut you could have done that when there was an audience here\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nI know\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nWe're evolving\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:21.000\nWhile the audience isn't here, it's kind of like being in a cocoon\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nYeah\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:27.000\nYeah, so while the knee pain was bad, this nerve pain was unbearable\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nAnd it came on a lot faster\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nAnd so I was like, I can't sit, which is a big part of my job\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nI can't drive, which is a bigger part of my job\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nI'm really freaking out\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nAnd then I couldn't run\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.000\nSo it's like everything that I had been doing with my life\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nI just all of a sudden couldn't do\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nAnd I was like, what am I doing with my life?\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nAnd so I talked to Brian LaFatta\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nAnd he was like, my brother does traditional Chinese medicine\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nYou should see someone like that\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nAnd then I was like, acupuncture\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nAnd he was like, sure\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nAnd so I was like, you know who does acupuncture?\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nSteve Agee\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nAnd he also has terrible health\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:02.000\nSo I asked him what the deal was\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nAnd he recommended me to an acupuncturist\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, because I got this sciatica\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:09.000\nAnd he was like, holy shit, they really did wonders on my sciatica\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nAnd I was like, oh yeah, jackpot\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:15.000\nAnd so I went like two or three days later\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nThat's the thing is that I was scheduling these doctor's appointments\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nAnd it's like, we could see you in two weeks or whatever the fuck\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nBut then the acupuncturists were like, yeah, come in tomorrow\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nLike come in the next day\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nAnd I was like, hell yeah, so it was great\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nBecause at this point it was like another week or so\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nBefore I'd get another doctor appointment\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nAnd I was in terrible pain\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nSo I go to the acupuncturist\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nI couldn't sit down\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:38.000\nThe drive over to the acupuncturist was like torture\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nIt was really, really bad\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nAnd by the time I was out of the car\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nI was like, I don't want to sit back down\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nAnd so I filled out the paperwork standing up\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nAnd then they brought me into this room\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:53.000\nThat had all this weird new age music\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nAnd relaxing music and a little steamy thing\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nMaking vaporizing water into the air\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nAnd they laid me down onto a table\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nAnd I think this is part of it\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:07.000\nThere's like, they cultivate an air of mystique\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nThey don't tell you anything, you know\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:12.000\nAnd there's things that I took as maybe cold reading techniques\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nShe was like, you don't drink enough water\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nAnd I was like, I drink a ton of water\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nI don't know\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nBut I actually didn't drink any water that day\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nAnd when I peed after I left\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nAnd my pee was like neon yellow\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nAnd I was like, wow, she really was right\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nSo they didn't tell me what I was doing\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:32.000\nShe just started stabbing needles into my back\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nAnd it hurt really bad\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:35.000\nReally?\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nThey go, I mean, not really bad\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nI mean, worse than a shot\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nBut they poke it\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nAnd then I don't know why they do it\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nBut they kind of push it in further\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nKind of twisted around or something\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nI think she was trying to hit a nerve or whatever\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nBecause then sometimes she would stab it right into like\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nWhat felt like a nerve and then it would just shoot\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nLike lightning down my body, you know\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nAnd I was like, you're trying to stay still\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nBut like your whole body's like jerking\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nBecause someone's stabbing you with fucking needles\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nInto your nerves, which are the things that are supposed to\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nFeel things the most, you know\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nIt was really crazy\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nSo she put the needles in\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nAnd then she left me for a while\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nAnd just left\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nAnd then she came back\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nAnd then she attached the wires to the needles\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nAnd was like, tell me when you feel it\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nAnd I was like, I don't feel it\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nAnd she was like, tell me when you feel it\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nAnd I'm like, what am I supposed to feel?\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nAnd she was like, you'll know\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:28.000\nAnd then eventually it started feeling\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:31.000\nLike someone was like rattling the little needles\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nBecause of the electrical shock\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nI don't know if it was jiggling the needles or whatever\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nBut it was like, so now I'm getting electricity\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:40.000\nSent through these needles that stabbed into my nerves\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.000\nYou know, and she turned up the power pretty high\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nBecause I wasn't feeling it\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nAnd she was like, oh, you're a strong guy\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nAnd I was like, I don't know\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:49.000\nI have a low pain tolerance\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nIt's just pretty painful to be stabbed\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nI'm just not feeling the lightning\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.000\nSo then she turned on the lightning\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:57.000\nAnd it was just zapping my body\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:00.000\nAnd it was making my muscles twitch and stuff\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nAnd she's like, just hang out here\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:03.000\nAnd I was like, for how long?\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nAnd it felt like 20 minutes\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:08.000\nJust with this machine buzzing\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nAnd just vibrating my body\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:14.000\nAnd I was making my nerves light up and glow\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nIt was really crazy\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nBut it felt like it was doing something\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nBecause those very same nerves that were in terrible pain\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nWere the ones that are now buzzing with electricity and stuff\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:28.000\nSo it felt like something was happening\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nAnd then eventually the machine finished\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:32.000\nAnd it made this crazy beeping sound\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nAnd she came back in and she took it all off\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nAnd then I didn't know this was going to happen\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:37.000\nBecause again, there's no communication\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:40.000\nShe just basically shows up and starts doing stuff\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nAnd she starts cupping me\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nYou guys know about cupping?\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nOh yeah, I do now, yeah\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nYeah, I'm sure you do\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nCupping is so weird, it better work\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.000\nYeah, I don't know\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nShe cupped me basically on the same\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nIf you don't know what cupping is\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nIt's like a suction cup that they put\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nAnd then they use like a balloon pump or some shit\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nTo suck all the air of it\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:07.000\nSo now like your skin is like sucking up\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:12.000\nI thought the artisanal way of doing that\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:16.000\nIs if they put like a match in there\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:19.000\nRight, but she was just using what sounded like a balloon pump\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nLike you can't see because they put you face down at a table\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nAnd you're looking through like a toilet seat at a chair\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:25.000\nThat's below your face\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nAnd like you don't know anything that they're doing\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:32.000\nYou just assume it's not make like placebo magic\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nBut yeah, so she cut me in all these spots\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nAnd that was really painful\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nLike that was as bad as it is to be stabbed with needles\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nThat are shooting lightning through your body\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nLike being cupped was really bad\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:49.000\nAre you gonna be mad at Levy if I saw the photo?\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:50.000\nNo, I know that happened\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nYou could have just asked, man\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nI'm the victim of revenge porn\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:58.000\nI didn't\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nWell, I didn't\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:02.000\nYou know, it's Levy had it on his phone\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nI was like, oh shit, and I saw it\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nAnd then I just\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nI'm not usually like I just\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:13.000\nIt was just like the air drop thing came up\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nBut I just before I even knew what I was doing\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:16.000\nI just hid it\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:17.000\nWhy did it come up?\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:18.000\nWell, I don't know\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nIt was just there\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:22.000\nYeah, that's not your fault if an air drop window pops\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nWell, no, it was\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nI mean, maybe it's because I hit the share button\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nI don't know\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nOh, well, yeah, okay\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nWell, that's what the story was\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nYeah, so you definitely did it\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nI didn't know what I was doing\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nI was just like, well, this seems like a valuable photo\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nI wasn't gonna show it to anybody else\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nI just, yeah, I really don't know\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nThat's how it starts\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nWhy that was my instinct\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nBut you wouldn't show it to the viewers\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:44.000\nNo, that's the\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:46.000\nWhat's embarrassing about that picture is\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:49.000\nNot like it's everything but the cupping marks\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nLike, I have weird acne scars on my back\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nAnd then stretch marks and like way too much hair\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nLike, I took the picture and I was like, man\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nI wish that my skin was better\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nBecause these cupping scars are crazy\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nBut this is like a gross picture\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:06.000\nWell, so anyways, I then take our word for it\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:10.000\nMr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nLike, it's fucking like\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nYou can see cupping pictures online\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nIt looks exactly like that\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.000\nExcept on my ass\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nIt's like giant hickeys\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nThe diameter of a softball\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nLike a wine glass\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:26.000\nWhat's the idea is it's drawing toxins out of your\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:27.000\nThat's what they said\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nShe was like, it's turning color\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:32.000\nThat means it's working because it takes stuff out of you\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nAnd it's like, it's turning color\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:36.000\nBecause all the oxygen is being rushed out of my skin\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nTo the surface of the skin\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nBecause of a vast pressure differential\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nHas nothing to do with toxins\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:45.000\nBut it felt like anti-acupuncture\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nBecause they were stabbing me before\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nAnd then those same spots they stab me\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nThey were then sucking, you know, air\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nI don't know if it was like\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nBut they look just like bruises\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nAre they, when you touch them\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nDo they hurt as much as a bruise?\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nThat size would hurt\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nOne of them kind of hurts\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nThe rest don't really feel like anything\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:05.000\nThat's interesting\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:06.000\nYeah, but\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nIt just looks like a straight up paintball bruise\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nEven worse really\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nJust like deep purple\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nYeah, it was really painful\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nIt's like if you know you get an Indian burn\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nLike they twist your skin on your arm\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nOr whatever\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nIt felt like that for like 10 minutes\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nWhile the cups were on my back\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nIt was really bad\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:26.000\nBut also they were making my muscles twitch\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.000\nWith the lightning\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nAnd so then like the muscles that were twitching\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:32.000\nJust felt like I had exercised them to death\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:35.000\nLike they felt dead and really really really sore\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nAnd so then by the time it was finished\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nI didn't feel like it wasn't crazy\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:41.000\nVast nerve pain\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:44.000\nLike I still felt that nerve like acting up\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:47.000\nBut it just kind of felt like my ass was sore\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nAnd then I was like wow that's really crazy\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nAnd so yeah then I drove home\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nAnd I wasn't in terrible pain on the trip home\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:56.000\nWhich was the same journey, you know the same length trip\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nAnd then the next day it felt a lot better\n\n17:58.000 --> 17:59.000\nAnd then the next day it felt a lot better\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nAnd today I feel basically nothing\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nI was like driving around all today\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nYou can kind of feel it a little bit coming in\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nAfter about an hour of driving\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nYou feel nothing as in a good thing\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nYou're not numb\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nWow\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nI was told because I had a little sciatica like pain\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.000\nA while back\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nAnd I was told and it instantly worked\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nIs do sit ups, do ab stuff\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nYeah the one thing I looked up online\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nWas this one stretch where you put your leg on a chair\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nAnd then you kind of pull your toe inward\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nAnd I kept doing that and I think it was helping\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nThere was one time I was driving and I had to like\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nStop driving and get out of the car\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nAnd then I just walked around for a bit\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nAnd then stretched my leg like that until I could get back in\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nAnd it was no good\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nHere's the tough thing about back pain\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nIs it\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nYou know your story is about\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nYou know the doctor said\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nIt's inflammation\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nRight\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nAnd he could just be\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nBut that was when he was right\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nHe wasn't talking about the sciatica at all\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nBecause like he didn't know that was happening\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nOr you know he didn't understand it was like\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nWell anyways I mean it's like\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nIt could have been\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nBecause it could have been something pushing\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nIt probably was\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nPushing your sciatic nerve\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nAnd then that just got reduced\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nAnd now we don't know if acupuncture works\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nRight that's the thing is that\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nAnytime I do anything like that\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nI always have to ask is like\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nIf I didn't do anything\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nWouldn't I also improve to an extent\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nOver time anyway\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nBut I don't know when I talked to Steve\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nHe said he got it for really long bursts\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nAnd it didn't feel like it was going away\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nBut then after that treatment\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nIt just instantly started going away\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nSo I don't know but I mean you know\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nNot like intuitively\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:33.000\nI don't know\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:34.000\nI will say\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nNow that I've been going to this chiropractor\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nFor as long as I have\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nI can definitely scientifically say\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nComparing it to\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:43.000\n40 years of\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nOther back treatments?\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\nYeah\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nOf going to different chiropractors\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nAnd then not going to them\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nThe inversion table and stuff like\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nWhatever my chiropractors doing is actually\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nIt has me pain free\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nI really thought\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nMy whole family\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nIt's the one thing that we\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nHave as a weakness on both sides of my\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nFamily like we have\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nReally strong tooth enamel\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:09.000\nStrong toenails\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nStrong hearts\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:12.000\nLungs\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:13.000\nEverything's\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nYou know we don't have a lot of like\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nStreaks of like proclivities\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nYou know for ailment\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:20.000\nGoing through my family tree\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nWe just kind of drink ourselves to death\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nOr smoke\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nDo you find that the strong toenails\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nHas benefited you and your family?\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:27.000\nWell Cody was just pointing that out\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nThe other day\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nI was like\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nShe was like wow\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nYou must be really healthy\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nLike these disgusting toenails\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nThat you need to clip immediately\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nAre really like\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nI don't know what\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nThey're not flimsy and jaundiced\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nThey're like eagle talons\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nExactly\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nIf you're just joining us\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nI'm gross\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nBut if you haven't seen Dan\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nSwoop through your neighborhood\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nAnd catch a squirrel\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nIt's amazing\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nI'm also a bad person\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nSo last time I was on this stage\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nI made fun of\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nI think that's a good description\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nI made fun of\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nThe podcast\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nUp and vanished\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nHosted by Payne Lindsay\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nWho you know\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nI just kind of characterised him as a\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.000\nAs a guy that you know\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nHe doesn't know what he's doing\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nHe didn't know what he was doing\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nHe learns what he's doing\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nBut then he\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:18.000\nBut it's just like a podcast\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:19.000\nAbout him going like\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nI don't know how to\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:21.000\nI want to try\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nI don't know\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:23.000\nI kind of made fun of him\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nI don't think I was like\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:25.000\nHigh-fiving him\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nI don't think I was that flattering\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nAnd then tonight\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nI saw that he\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nHe tweeted\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nIt was clear\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nHe had heard the thing\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nBecause I said he sounded like Chris Pratt\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nAnd he said\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nSo he tweeted\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nI saw a tweet from him\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nAnd said\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nWell at least I sound like Chris Pratt\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:43.000\nAnd then\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:44.000\nI think they had an emoji\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nThat was like\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:46.000\nKind of like a guy\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:47.000\nWith a hand over his face\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:48.000\nOr something like that\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:49.000\nLike he was embarrassed\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:50.000\nBecause then\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:51.000\nCody looked him\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nLooked him up\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nYou know\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nAnd you know\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nHe's just an adorable guy\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nYou know\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:58.000\nLoves his wife\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nAnd like\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nHe did a good true crime podcast\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nAnd then I made fun of him\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nAnd I didn't want him to hear it\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nYou know that some shit had like\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nYeah\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nSomeone just probably told him about it\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nLike couldn't resist\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nYou know\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.000\nI just don't understand that\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nLike the person that felt the need to\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nRon Jeremy\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nTo track down Ron Jeremy's\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:17.000\nReddit and then\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:18.000\nYeah\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nI still maintain that that guy though\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nIf he's listening\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\nI didn't really\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:24.000\nI know a good person\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nI didn't really think that that guy\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nNo\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nThe guy that went to Ron Jeremy\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.000\nI didn't\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:29.000\nI didn't\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:30.000\nI didn't feel like that guy\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:31.000\nWas\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:32.000\nWas really\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nTrying to cause B for\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nIt's just weird that like\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nYou say something\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.000\nLike I mean\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nIt's stupid to think\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:39.000\nThat what we're doing here\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:40.000\nIs in a vacuum\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nOf course what we say\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:42.000\nWill send ripples out\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nAnd butterfly effects\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:44.000\nAnd all this shit\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:45.000\nBut\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nLike it's just like\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nEverything we say\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nCan reach\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nIt's unintended target\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nYeah\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nProbably will\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nAnd maybe\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nMaybe Payne Lindsay\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nWas already a listener\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nWhich would be rad\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:56.000\nYou know\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:57.000\nHe's a\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:58.000\nHe's a fun guy\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\nHe'd make a great guest\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.000\nWe should have him on the show\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:01.000\nMaybe Ron Jeremy's\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nHe sounds like Chris Pratt\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nWe should get Ron Jeremy on the show\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nGet to the bottom of that shit\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nWell we did get to the bottom of it\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nI think we have to go straight to the source\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nThat would be amazing\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nIf we got him on the show\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nWe were interviewing\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nAnd we were like\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nWell I gotta ask\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nI gotta ask\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:15.000\nWhat's with the\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:16.000\nWhat's with the\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nBanana peel\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:18.000\nHe has every\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:19.000\nHe has every right\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:20.000\nTo say\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nI don't know what you're talking about\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:22.000\nMaybe I was drunk and doing a joke\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nLike he might just\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nLike\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nThrow that away\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nLike so many\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nBanana peels\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.000\nOh shit\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nHe would have a right to do that\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:30.000\nBut that would make him a big liar\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:31.000\nBecause when\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:32.000\nWhen the person said it to him\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nHe\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nHe had a very quick response\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nThat\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nHe knew exactly what that person was talking about\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nI think he had a fallback\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nI think\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nWhen somebody\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nGoes on his reddit\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:43.000\nAnd asks him\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nSpecific questions\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:45.000\nHe has a cute answer\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nThat's very\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:48.000\nConvenient\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:49.000\nBut in the moment\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:50.000\nI think he had ulterior motives\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nThat were way more complicated\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nIn the moment\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:54.000\nHe could be both\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:55.000\nI think that's giving him too much credit\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nFor being clever to say\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nLike he has all these versions\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nOf how to deal with people\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nAsking him about a banana peel\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\nDid we talk about\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nMy conversation with\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\nDavid Keith\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:07.000\nKeith David\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:08.000\nKeith David\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nI always do that\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nKeith David\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:11.000\nAbout cross-mounted pussy\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:14.000\nWe've talked about on the show\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:15.000\nI believe right\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.000\nYeah I mean\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nIt's been going on for so long\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\nI can't remember\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nBut when he was on\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:23.000\nRicky Morty\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.000\nLike I think the last\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.000\nRicky Morty right\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:30.000\nMaybe we're repeating old news here\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nBut there's a line in the movie\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nPlatoon\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nThat Keith David says\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nAnd he refers to going back\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nSniffing that cross-mounted pussy\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:40.000\nDown by the river\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nAnd Matt Gorley and I\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:43.000\nFrom Super Ego fame\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nAnd Harmon Quest fame\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nHave really tried to get to the bottom\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nOf what is cross-mounted pussy\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nWhy is it cross-mounted\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nWhat are the pros and cons\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nOf it being cross-mounted\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nAnd Dan worked with him\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nOn community a couple of times\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:59.000\nAnd you asked him\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nAnd you didn't get a satisfactory answer to that\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:02.000\nNo\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nHe was so nice when I met him\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nI was wearing this exact same suit\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:07.000\nWith a kind of a little window pane check\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nAnd he was wearing a similar suit\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:10.000\nThere's a photo that I have\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:11.000\nI think on my Insta noodles\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:15.000\nAnd he was so pleasant\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:16.000\nI go okay I'm going to be\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nThat guy and I'm going to ask you\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:19.000\nAbout platoon\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nSo I got some platoon questions\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nWhere he's like lay him on me\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nAnd we talked and talked and talked\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nAbout cross-mounted pussy\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nAnd we finally came to the conclusion\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:27.000\nHe goes look man I don't know\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nThat was some Oliver Stone shit\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nLike he just said that was\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nI was just reading my lines\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nOh yeah\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:37.000\nSo the answer is we don't know\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:40.000\nSo now I don't want to have to deal\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.000\nWith Oliver Stone about this issue\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nBecause he's going to do a run Jeremy\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:44.000\nAnd have some fucking terse\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nConvenient answer that doesn't satisfy\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:47.000\nMe or anybody else\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:50.000\nWhy can't you believe that's his line\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nBecause here's the thing\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:53.000\nIt's like you're expecting it\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nTo be something dirty I think\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\nBecause it's like a banana\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:57.000\nAnd so the fact that it's not\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:00.000\nThat's like it's a brilliant move\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:01.000\nWhat I think it was\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:02.000\nI think he had a banana peel on his shoulder\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nI don't think he had a clever line\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:05.000\nReady to go or a dirty line\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:08.000\nLike a salacious like rejoinder\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:09.000\nWhen somebody asked him about it\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nI do know that he seemed bummed out\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:12.000\nWhen a guy asked him about it\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nFrom behind his back\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:16.000\nSo that leads me in that direction\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nBut I think that maybe he was just doing that\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nI think he was in a bad mood\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nNo come on we've been over this\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:25.000\nWe got this figured out from top to bottom\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:28.000\nIt's a thing that he does\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nIf he sees a banana peel\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:33.000\nHe does that\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nIt's one of maybe five things\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nThat he has up his sleeve\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:40.000\nAnd he likes to be funny\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:43.000\nProbably for the girls\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nAnd didn't want to be vulnerable\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:48.000\nWith you and was like\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:52.000\nYeah I mean you just saw a weird side of him\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nI think then he takes a banana peel\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nWhen you ask him if you're a woman\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nWhy are you wearing a banana peel\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nI think it ends up with somehow\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nPussy being cross mounted\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nAnd I think the cross mounted pussy\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nIs like it's holy it's holy pussy\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:07.000\nIt's like it's like on a cross\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:08.000\nIt's like Christ pussy\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nOh shit yeah\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nIt's like the best pussy\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nThat was one of our theories we thought about\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:16.000\nThat's probably a cross mounted pussy\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nGross\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nYeah\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nIf you love a pussy don't crucify it\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:21.000\nThat's about it\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.000\nIt's Schrab's birthday\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nOh yeah\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nHe's not here\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:26.000\nHe's off somewhere\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:29.000\nBut I have to for Schrab leaves town tomorrow\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nHe goes back to Milwaukee\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nAnd he's going to speak at his alma mater\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:35.000\nIf I'm using that term right\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nThe place he graduated from\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nThe Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:43.000\nAnd he wanted me to do like a\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:46.000\nAn introduction on video for him\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nSo I guess we could\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nWe could knock that out right now\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:51.000\nBecause you're able to\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nIn addition to live streaming it\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:54.000\nYou can like also\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:55.000\nYeah you'll have it\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nAnd then I can just give him a clip right\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:58.000\nYeah\n\n27:58.000 --> 27:59.000\nDo you want some music for this Dan\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nOr do you want to go dry\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:04.000\nWhat do you

Notre\n\n58:28.280 --> 58:32.520\nDamien said yeah yeah and every so they invented this thing this year or every\n\n58:32.520 --> 58:36.840\nturnover which is like where they force change of possession yeah the change of\n\n58:36.840 --> 58:40.920\npossession so when the other team has the ball and they intercepted or recover\n\n58:40.920 --> 58:48.480\na fumble whatever player forces the turnover the turnover they get this\n\n58:48.480 --> 58:55.000\ngiant golden chain with the you on it the turnover chain and then they wear it's\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:59.560\nlike eight pounds or something during the game during the game no no they don't\n\n58:59.560 --> 59:02.520\nwear it on the field but they wear on the sideline and they're like they get\n\n59:02.520 --> 59:08.080\ntheir moment yeah that's awesome yeah and you ever check out a 30 for 30 30 for\n\n59:08.080 --> 59:13.480\n30 yeah you might like it it's the narrative part of sports not the sports\n\n59:13.480 --> 59:17.440\npart yeah that's true yeah I'm watching the one I'm halfway through the one\n\n59:17.440 --> 59:20.880\nabout Rick flair have you watched that one that sounds really interesting it's\n\n59:20.880 --> 59:24.440\nyeah it's called nature boy and it's really good because I didn't know that\n\n59:24.440 --> 59:28.280\nmuch about Rick flair and what his life was like but like I don't know he I mean\n\n59:28.280 --> 59:32.360\nhe's still with us and he still he still looks like Rick flair but like he like\n\n59:32.360 --> 59:37.640\nthere's there's still teams that in their war in their locker room warm-up\n\n59:37.640 --> 59:43.000\nchant like his like ring banter like when he would come into the ring and grab\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:47.240\nthe microphone they quote Rick flair that's how much of an impact he had on\n\n59:47.240 --> 59:54.200\nlike sports as celebrity right now he's like a yoga guy right don't spoil it for\n\n59:54.200 --> 01:00:00.240\nme Spencer Rick flair was the guy who his catchphrase was whoo whoo that's the\n\n01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.760\nkid but you go like I'm the wheel and dealing kiss stealing you know like\n\n01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.160\nglockenspieling he didn't say that when I made that up but I would that'd be\n\n01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:12.080\namazing if he was glockenspieling because catchphrases hadn't been you know\n\n01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:17.280\nthat the industry wasn't in full swing yet well you had your catchphrase could\n\n01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.400\njust be whoo you've already had Muhammad Ali he was certainly standing on\n\n01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.480\nMuhammad Ali shoulders and he kind of I think not ripped him off but certainly\n\n01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:30.800\nwas doing his his silver-haired riff on that but yeah he was you know just like\n\n01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.760\ncheating on his wife all the time and doing you know like like drinking a lot\n\n01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.840\nand wrestling a lot and saying woo a lot but it's a good documentary what do you\n\n01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:46.600\nguys do when you go home at night like every night video games and sleep or\n\n01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:52.080\nemails or something like that church and I'll get in the couch and we'll watch\n\n01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.360\nlike chop junior and fucking yellow the TV oh yeah chop junior so much better\n\n01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:00.000\nthan chopped it's not even funny is that the one with the kids yeah so my\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.760\nbrother you know they do fantasy sports like fantasy football and say they\n\n01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:10.000\ndraft in the beginning of the season all these friends go in and they get I\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.560\nthink five kids and they all put money in and then it's whoever's kid ends up\n\n01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:21.600\nwinning gets the pot I'm not a fantasy sports fan I don't do that but I could\n\n01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.960\nget down on that yeah it's great we have a blast they all get around they watch\n\n01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.360\nthe episodes together or yelling at each other when the kids are like screwing\n\n01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.880\nup cooking and stuff I feel like you guys are having more fun living than me\n\n01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.920\nlike here okay Dan I agree what do you do when you don't have fun either well I\n\n01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.760\njust want Cody and I we like we just like being together we watch we if we\n\n01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.160\nwatch something we'll watch like a true crime thing but there are no we'll just\n\n01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.080\nlisten to one of a list of podcasts and things but yeah that sounds really\n\n01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.880\nboring spending time with loved ones I'm just saying I'm not talking about you\n\n01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.760\nguys are having more fun I guess I mean like you guys seem like you're in a\n\n01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:02.680\nbetter mood than me that's what I meant tonight like like lately you know like\n\n01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:07.960\nI've been I've been I've been feeling like like with very little variation like\n\n01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:15.120\nI've been like like getting closer and closer to just like I just just about\n\n01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:21.160\nthe world I'm just so deeply cynical like yeah yeah but I feel like you've been\n\n01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:27.680\npretty good yeah I feel like you've been in a good place well I think well\n\n01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.280\nthere's an irony there though that's like kind of deceptive because I think I\n\n01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.440\ntruly like I've kind of given up on humanity so once you've done that you\n\n01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:39.200\nget in bad moods less because you're like oh you're not you're they're not\n\n01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.880\nletting you down anymore and you're not like striving to accomplish anything I'm\n\n01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.200\njust like oh I live on a planet of fucking drooling babbling animals I know\n\n01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.960\nthat I'm in a worse mood generally lately than I have been probably ever and\n\n01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:56.560\nI don't know if that's just the ravages of time or the or the the fact that we\n\n01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.400\nhave a moron a literate douchebag president and who constantly every day\n\n01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.800\nmakes us embarrassed to be alive I have a theory slash rant about like I don't\n\n01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:10.320\nknow you know we've learned so much about psychology recently you know for\n\n01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.240\nthe longest time we haven't understood psychology and sociology on the level\n\n01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.960\nwe have and like trauma and how that impacts the brain and stuff but you\n\n01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.400\nknow there's obviously been human atrocities and terrible tragedies and\n\n01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.600\ntrying times through all of human history and stuff but I don't know how\n\n01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.800\noften we've been able to really think about it on that level I wonder if you\n\n01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.640\nknow this sort of stuff has an effect on people historically like if you went\n\n01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.400\nback to I don't know like the Great Leap Forward or something or Holocaust\n\n01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.960\ntimes if people weren't also feeling like that you know just generally more\n\n01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.720\nagitated more at odds with people I wonder if that's something that's\n\n01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.400\nhappening if I would say it probably certainly does like it's like a low-grade\n\n01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:56.880\nif you look like this giant protest and all those Nazis at 50,000 fucking yeah\n\n01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:04.720\nthat's an unhappy world saying fix it fix it fix it wait where was it what do\n\n01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:09.080\nyou talk about Warsaw six Poland yeah that's when I really checked out man I\n\n01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:13.480\nsaw I was like is like are you fucking kidding me I'm Polish like I like like\n\n01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:19.840\nraces pull it pull it pull Polish people are we're the original Nazi victims I\n\n01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.600\nmean we're like like we were getting picked on like like my ancestors fled\n\n01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:30.880\nthat shit like it it's like it's fucking it's fucking insane the entire city of\n\n01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.680\nWarsaw was bombed into oblivion that I guess I've just probably not more than\n\n01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:41.280\na couple buildings that are still standing pre-1940 you know for the\n\n01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.840\nwhole place just got annihilated it just makes me check out you know like I\n\n01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.200\ndon't I don't there's nothing it's just so much bigger than all of us you know\n\n01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:54.640\nit's so it's so inexorable and so you just want to go well shit I should have\n\n01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:00.120\nI should have spent the last year you know sticking to my elliptical and\n\n01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.960\nactually like building a doomsday shelter and all this stuff because it's not\n\n01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:08.120\ngonna take it's not it didn't happen overnight so it kept snapping back out\n\n01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:13.600\nof it and going things will be okay but like it's just like the truth is or at\n\n01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:19.360\nleast feels like that it's like okay we're on like a five-year slide into\n\n01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:24.560\nhell on earth in one form or another whether it's nuclear annihilation or\n\n01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:31.880\njust like fucking like total like global fascist\n\n01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:40.480\ncoups resulting in like a crazy like I can't tell which is gonna be worse like\n\n01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.320\nthe war version of it or the peace version of it where but like in any case\n\n01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:50.520\nlike just like the definition of inhumanity like getting so much harder\n\n01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:55.840\nto meet in other words like atrocity becoming more and more tolerable and\n\n01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:01.640\npeople pulling back more and more like I just like I saw that those that photo\n\n01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:07.080\nof Poland like it's just like it looks like Mordor just out yeah I can't what\n\n01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:11.800\nI was supposed to do throw a tin can at it like what how am I supposed to brush\n\n01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:18.320\nmy teeth why why how can I give a fuck like the people have spoken like

01:08:37.440\nI get soda like I always ask for just the can and not the glass because if you\n\n01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:40.640\nask for the glass they'll just put like four ounces of soda and then keep the\n\n01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:44.200\ncan and then they never do that and it's like you're you're not even going\n\n01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:48.240\nsomewhere else you're just reaching in to grab a can and I don't know I hate\n\n01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:54.080\nrestaurants that like you when you order delivery and they have Diet Coke on\n\n01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.240\ntheir menu and then they you

probably represents like two ounces of of actual Diet Coke from a soda\n\n01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:15.040\nfountain instead of a can give me a can of Diet Coke taped up well yeah they\n\n01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.040\ntape it up because you know so it doesn't spell because they have to put all\n\n01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:25.240\nthis effort into saving money just give me a can of Coke you knobs yeah

lesbian and I did talk about like I but I honest I\n\n01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.480\nhave to be perfectly honest with you I I I the timing of this is like I was I was\n\n01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:50.680\nchecked out like I wasn't I wasn't there for that victory mentally I I heard\n\n01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.280\nabout it third hand you know like like after the fact because I wasn't\n\n01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:58.080\nfollowing it I wasn't rooting for anything I wasn't I wasn't invested I\n\n01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.400\nwas like numb but that is great to hear it is and it's great to hear that that\n\n01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:09.080\nguy molested a 14 year old that's it is great so did you see the guy the guy\n\n01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.880\nwith the I retweeted that guy with the hammer yeah I mean I feel like I stole\n\n01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.120\nyour your no it's because I like I just go I'm not doing any jokes I just I'm\n\n01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.040\njust so angry like I got so many really telling it people all the time this is\n\n01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:27.200\nabout the guy taking a correct yeah it's the thing that he bought correct has his\n\n01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.920\nmoney here's my question he took a hammer out which is the least which I\n\n01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.000\nbelieve I want to know I'm trying to piece together the narrative like I want\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.520\nto take out index cards and with each fact that we know because one of them is\n\n01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.840\nthat he owns that machine one of them is that he I won't say what wants to\n\n01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:48.320\nyou know loves fucking children like but he he he we won't go that far but but\n\n01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.320\nwe know that love supports Hannity like they so that's one index card and then\n\n01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:57.120\nhe said yeah so I was thinking like is this is did it become his favorite show\n\n01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:01.720\nbecause of the the child fucking support or or was it already his favorite show\n\n01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.560\nand then and then and then he saw and then

and then some guy responded\n\n01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:10.000\nand logically whoever it is I did block him because I read some of his other\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.960\nstuff and I didn't dig it but but what he said was fine to start a conversation\n\n01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:20.400\nbut I just know where the conversation is going to lead and it was a oh so if I\n\n01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.160\naccused you of molesting me when I was 14 you wouldn't want your friends and\n\n01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.600\nfamily to presume you innocent and protect you until blah blah blah blah\n\n01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:30.080\nnice to know if you didn't say the nice to know thing I might have I might have\n\n01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.520\nreplied and like not instantly blocked him but the thing is like your\n\n01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.760\npresumption of innocence thing yes of course everyone's presumed innocent I\n\n01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.480\nmean it's innocent so it's presumed innocent until until proven guilty but\n\n01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:47.160\nnot Obama was he was he was he admitted it he admitted it they're like here's\n\n01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.120\nthese kids that coming forward the saint he touched me he goes on television I\n\n01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.760\nnever dated any daughters underage without their mother's permission that's\n\n01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:59.920\nadmitting he admitted it like it's not even alleged he fucking did it and he\n\n01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:05.120\ndidn't buy anybody any beers yeah no but that's saying I did it yeah but like\n\n01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:11.080\npeople are saying oh he admitted it like we Bill Cosby hasn't been proven\n\n01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:16.800\nguilty 9,000 women said he raped him I was me hasn't admitted it yeah you go\n\n01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:25.960\nyeah but exactly to his credit he's a fighter listen if you take one lesson\n\n01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:32.400\naway from tonight show okay but does Keurig make money off the K-Cups I\n\n01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:37.760\nthought any company can make K-Cups and they make the machine right so so they're\n\n01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.640\nnot continuing to make dollars after the purchase because you get your K-Cups\n\n01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.160\nfrom you know anyway he could have gotten K-Cups from a pedophile company and\n\n01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.600\nand actually really stuck it to Keurig yeah somebody I don't know who it is\n\n01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.640\nsomebody if you could find it on my Twitter replies to that tweet I forget\n\n01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.920\nwho it is someone said that that's why I get all my coffee from chock full of\n\n01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:03.080\nNambla I was a chock full of underage nuts the thing that I think is really\n\n01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:10.560\nfunny is is the idea of of boycotting a company for pulling its sponsorship I\n\n01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:14.840\nthink that's really funny like because we're not really that's that's it's\n\n01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.560\nalready too complicated if you want you don't think the company already did the\n\n01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.760\nmath on this like like they're the ones with the most at stake you're so dumb\n\n01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:27.440\nyou're smashing your own property thinking it's punishing someone they they\n\n01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:33.480\nhave accountants like and PR people like they crunched the numbers and said look\n\n01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:37.880\nI wish we weren't in this situation but the truth is we make a penny more in the\n\n01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:43.080\nlong run if we don't sponsor the pedophile show and but but also the\n\n01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.600\nfunny thing about it is like you're punishing you're punishing the free\n\n01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.360\nmarket you're punishing like you're punishing like a company just going just\n\n01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.480\nnot doing anything you're just like they're going like well we just don't\n\n01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.360\nwant a lot of people's be pulling our sponsors a lot of people's beef is that\n\n01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:01.160\nthat it's it looks like the optics of it looked like that courage pulled their\n\n01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:06.880\nsponsorship after tweets like yeah so so so say they did how the fuck do you\n\n01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.840\nwant a corporation to behave that's what I mean liberal liberals aren't this\n\n01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.320\ninsane you know like there's a lot of dumb liberals like like like 85% of\n\n01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.240\neverybody's overreacting to everything at all times but it's but it's just like\n\n01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:24.680\nthey imitate the right imitates the left and it's like just bizarre but they\n\n01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.520\ndon't understand it's like you really you realize that they're sociopaths\n\n01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.960\nbecause you go like you don't understand anything then because like it's\n\n01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:36.080\ndifferent to say oh these it was like like this is the list of sponsors for\n\n01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:39.880\nthis thing that we don't like okay uber you're you're in the crosshairs we're\n\n01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.520\nnot gonna take uber okay everybody I'm deleting my uber app here's a video of\n\n01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:47.760\nme deleting it hey don't don't sponsor uber because uber sponsors this thing\n\n01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.280\nand then you wait for uber to cave or no cave and then like this idea of because\n\n01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:57.080\nthey don't they don't even have that they can't go to shows that aren't\n\n01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:01.680\nsupporting pedophilia and that's a like I'm gonna stop using your ride\n\n01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.320\nshared service until you support that's why Jeff's joke is so perfect because\n\n01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.360\nwhat are you trying to say other than I only support companies who defend\n\n01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:16.360\npedophilia monetarily yeah I mean it's pretty insane I is insane I only want\n\n01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:20.080\ncoffee but you everyone should have the right to defend pedophilia and make me a\n\n01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.680\ndelicious cup of coffee right it's a it's an absurd position but that's their\n\n01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.600\nespouse position so either admission I love people throwing their their\n\n01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:32.040\nexpensive machinery off of a landing it like under the sidewalk and it's like\n\n01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.960\nit's not heavy enough to be dramatic yeah also the guy's hammer thing it's like\n\n01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:40.040\nthere's a lot of internal cuts and that's a lot of internal edits so you can\n\n01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.840\nmake it look like magic they had to go shit I need a I need some water like I\n\n01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.120\ngotta hydrate this is taken forever like there's a lot of internal cuts with a\n\n01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:51.160\nthing keeps moving around and yeah that guy bothered to reply to me after I was\n\n01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.720\nlike you know aren't you supposed to be using a bat what's with the goggles and\n\n01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.840\nthen he was like I was trying to show how silly something is or like something\n\n01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:03.040\nlike that like he was being ironic about it but he wasn't because all he was\n\n01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.320\ntalking about is how it was alleged and we can't do this but then he was saying\n\n01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:11.640\nhe was making a joke it's like you're clearly not making a joke I could hit\n\n01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:16.520\nhim wearing sandals and socks and and and a helmet yeah that's the you want\n\n01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.960\nshoes if you're gonna be hammering something at your feet you don't need\n\n01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.880\nfucking a hard hat what's gonna fall on your fucking head I just also love the\n\n01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:27.840\nidea I'm so mad boycotts don't work by you throwing out the thing that you\n\n01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.200\nalready paid for I know I mean that was the Starbucks boycott was the same\n\n01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:35.840\nthing you're gonna say Merry Christmas we're gonna fucking buy coffee all of\n\n01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:40.000\nit capitalism doesn't work when you demand the corporations pay fealty to\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.720\nyour ideological agenda it doesn't it doesn't make any sense like that it's\n\n01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:49.040\na boycott is a is a reaction when you when you're you're you're you're\n\n01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:53.480\nprotesting a company you're trying to say let's hit them where it hurts in\n\n01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:57.120\ntheir wallet so you go to the sponsor and say we are not going to support your\n\n01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:00.800\ncompany as long as you continue to make it financially possible for this person\n\n01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:07.400\nto blah blah blah that makes sense nothing makes sense about the idea that\n\n01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:14.040\nthat coffee company is supposed to feel bad or punished for not doing something\n\n01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:19.360\nthey don't feel like doing like they they stopped advertising during the show\n\n01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.960\nbecause so you're saying like from now on it's important the corporations really\n\n01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.720\ntoe the line it's important that they they they they they like so so you're a\n\n01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:32.320\ncommunist you're a fucking like what are you right like you're not a capitalist\n\n01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.600\nyou're not you're aren't you gonna be lecturing me about the free market two\n\n01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.440\ndays from now isn't this whole thing about fucking money you suck at business\n\n01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.600\nyou're an idiot you think we're gonna we're gonna make money as a country at\n\n01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:50.440\na world where you demand coffee machines love pedophilia or else that you\n\n01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:55.760\nshould demand that they like coffee brother because otherwise the country's\n\n01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:00.760\ngonna go broke man like like like like it just done I don't I can't do it\n\n01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:05.040\nanymore I'm gonna fucking shoot my

a healer kind of thing did I\n\n01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:51.400\ntalk about Floyd the tree whisperer last episode I don't think so there's\n\n01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.080\nthere's shit going down with the the is that the guy that we waited for on Sunday\n\n01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:00.320\nthe eucalyptus tree is the boot since yeah well it's I mean this is the\n\n01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:04.000\nremember when she talked about the well-respected arborist or whatever like\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:11.000\nyeah I met that guy and he yeah I could swear I talked about this though I feel\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.760\nlike you did yeah I heard about but I just don't remember if it was on the\n\n01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:21.200\nshow yeah I thought so well this dude came out who looks like a\n\n01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.800\nteamster in a sleeveless shirt but then I started noticing things like like his\n\n01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:35.240\nhis tattoos were kind of like so I just I hit the mistake that was not well I\n\n01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.840\njust noticed he had tattoos that says even though he looked kind of\n\n01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:41.880\nstraight laced but then and then also he had like blue nail polish on it with\n\n01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:47.360\nlike yellow moons on the like somebody somebody had spent time on his nails and\n\n01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:52.760\nthen he said he's talking about the tree and how he can tell me if the tree\n\n01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:57.080\nneeds to be cut down which it does because it's dead but then he he needed\n\n01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:02.480\nto talk to the tree for a second and as he stepped forward he realized that the\n\n01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:08.040\nshirt he was wearing was a Gal Gadot Wonder Woman shirt there's just the\n\n01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.960\nfront didn't have anything on it but then the back that was like just the\n\n01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:15.560\ngreatest like reveal that he was wearing this like Wonder Woman shirt the\n\n01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:19.840\nwhole time but he went over to talk to the tree talk to the trees like he's\n\n01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:25.520\nlike this tree is like really sad and dying and dead and like did he put his\n\n01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:29.920\nhand on it like how does he talk to it yeah I know why I didn't I that was my\n\n01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.160\nmistake that his but he also showed us that he's like this is dangerous there's\n\n01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.240\nlike this shit on it like this kind of rot that it's like a fungus that grows\n\n01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.880\non dead wood and it like if the neighbor's kid like started playing\n\n01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.880\nwith it it could get really sick like it could he said he got he almost died\n\n01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.880\nonce because he inhaled a bunch of it and it like grows a fungus in your lungs\n\n01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.880\nand stuff and that one a tree attacks that's well this I mean the tree has\n\n01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.800\njust been dying for him for a long time it's like you know it's hollow you can\n\n01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:08.560\nI mean it's like the roots aren't even connected to the trunk it's it's just\n\n01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.160\nthis giant eucalyptus tree that's like leaning towards my neighbor's house and\n\n01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:17.680\nready to fall on it the $8,000 it will cost to cut it down what do you split\n\n01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.640\nthat I don't know they have a landlord is the way that it will fall over and\n\n01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.400\ncrash into your like like into your house and kill everybody yeah it will it\n\n01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.080\nwill what it will one day fall on my neighbor's house we had to cut down when\n\n01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.480\nI was a kid I grew up with giant eucalyptus trees in our neighborhood when\n\n01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:37.080\nI was a little kid in testin and there was like the garage like that side of\n\n01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.720\nthe house and like a five foot gap and then the house and then in between that\n\n01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:47.800\nwas a hill with a giant like you know hundred foot eucalyptus tree this giant\n\n01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.800\ntree and they cut it down and it fell exactly in between that these these\n\n01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:56.160\npros came in and did all this math and all this stuff and check the windage and\n\n01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:00.520\nall this shit boom right in between the houses if it had gone a foot either way\n\n01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.320\nit would have destroyed something yeah I don't think they do like that anymore I\n\n01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:07.040\nthink they do it in chunks yeah and that's why Floyd won't be a part of it\n\n01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:13.880\nFloyd Floyd said he said I come here to tell you that the tree wants to be needs\n\n01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:19.160\nto be cut down he's be you know put out of its misery or whatever and I won't do\n\n01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:24.760\nit myself I won't take that money I won't take that job because I I he said he\n\n01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:28.720\ncharacterized it like as he's gotten older he's learned to empathize with humans\n\n01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:34.480\nalmost as much as trees and so he's really worried about the day laborers\n\n01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:38.560\nthat you bring in to like these guys climb up if you if you've ever seen\n\n01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:44.200\nthese people bring down a big tree in Los Angeles it's harrowing yeah I I\n\n01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:48.080\nunderstand what he's saying completely I can't believe that anyone asks anyone\n\n01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:54.000\nto do that job it's insane like they go up with these with ropes and and they're\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.760\njust chainsawing shit up there and they're tying things it's just like it\n\n01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:02.560\nlooks like a Cirque du Soleil act but but designed to kill a human and so he\n\n01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:08.980\ndoesn't want any part of that but he demanded that I notify him when we do\n\n01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:12.040\ndecide to cut the tree down because he wants to come out and do a memorial\n\n01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:22.200\nservice so which I definitely will be like recording I will I will I will not\n\n01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:26.440\nbe mocking it I think I but I will be I will be sharing it with as many people\n\n01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.160\nas possible cuz I because this guy's definitely very interesting to it that's\n\n01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:33.600\npretty pretty weird I kept making jokes and he was just this is one of those\n\n01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:39.280\nguys it's like my jokes were not landing with this guy you know like I was I was\n\n01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.600\nlike man I feel really bad like because I feel like I'm a party to this because I\n\n01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.880\nmoved into this house and I I replaced the pipes there were clay pipes from\n\n01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:54.240\n1929 I mean like this tree must have been so excited when I moved in taking all\n\n01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:58.560\nmy nacho shits and stuff and now and then I replaced the pipes with plastic so\n\n01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:03.720\nit's probably like that's probably part of it you know like I starved it out it\n\n01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:08.680\nwas it was roots were growing into my pipes and causing the sewage to back up\n\n01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:17.160\ninto my bathtub let's play a little this D&D show me all right D&D Dan well\n\n01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:23.960\nSpencer hands down the the character sheets what was the sound that when\n\n01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:27.960\nyou heard Barbara and Nigel knocking things over like you hear some sort of\n\n01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:34.320\ncrash in the background yeah and I think it was this let it go a little\n\n01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:46.160\nsomething like this or maybe when you heard that did you give a did you make\n\n01:30:46.160 --> 01:31:00.440\nthis response and then and then

01:33:36.400\nto turn it in and they had a debriefing with the guys who took\n\n01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:41.880\nPatchens to talk to him some more and you guys agreed to meet him and then you\n\n01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:47.400\nwent to the tavern you tried appetizers at the tavern but Diarrhea Jr. could not\n\n01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:53.280\nbe dissuaded by the snacks and instead went to seek out Patchens and he sought\n\n01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.600\nhim out and he found Patchens and Patchens was pissed Patchens was like I\n\n01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.080\njust want to tell you guys fuck you guys and I'm leaving I gotta handle my\n\n01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:07.320\nbusiness and fuck you and he left and then Diarrhea Jr. went back to the\n\n01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:12.800\ntavern and they discussed what to do and I think that Dan might have wanted to\n\n01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:16.160\nhelp him and then Jeff didn't want to help him for a while and then Jeff really\n\n01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:20.800\nwanted to help him and then Jeff went to help him and he summoned a horse oh\n\n01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.760\nyeah he summoned the horse and he found Patchens and he told him to wait right\n\n01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:30.520\nthere and then he did wait right there and then they all arrived and talked to\n\n01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.960\nPatchens and after a discussion they

this town which is the place where we think the banditos who were actually\n\n01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:42.080\ndisguised as banditos but were in fact gill professional assassins they they\n\n01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:45.200\nthey we were it's pretty clear they came from this town\n\n01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:50.200\ndoorknester it seemed like they did because it was a very nearby town to\n\n01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:56.480\nthe site of burglary and it's a town of roughs and brigands you know the kind\n\n01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:01.000\nof people who commit crimes the name of that town

01:36:24.200\nmentioned that to him but I didn't want to tell Geffen too much because we don't\n\n01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.880\nknow if he's a good guy or bad guy and he could be one of those good guys it\n\n01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:30.960\nturns out to be a bad guy right okay so where do we stand right now we are we\n\n01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.760\non foot are we are we in doorknester are we are we are not in doorknester you\n\n01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.960\nhad kind of you would I don't remember exactly you're certainly on the way to\n\n01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.360\ndoorknester so we were pretty close yeah are we are we traveling on foot we've\n\n01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:47.200\ngot a wagon you're on foot alright far as I understand at the crest of a hill\n\n01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:51.360\nyou can see the town in the outlying area below you're kind of yeah you're at\n\n01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:55.440\nthe crest of a hill doorknester is calm and quiet with only a few flickering\n\n01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:00.480\nlights visible in the night you can hear soft music as if from a loop that floats\n\n01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:06.040\ngently into your ears a haunting and mournful harp melody I guess it's not a\n\n01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:13.600\nloop it's a harp melody coming from the bat valley below you it's a it's it's it's a weird time\n\n01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:17.560\nit's late in the night so it's a weird time to hear music let's go to the\n\n01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:27.520\nconcert is my my sort of arcane how easy would it be for me to recognize this is\n\n01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.680\npossibly magical beguiling music you know you have a do you have any ranks in\n\n01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:40.840\nknowledge okay I listen as close as I can Spencer all right I have only have\n\n01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.880\nonly have ranks in knowledge religion everything else is like checked off but\n\n01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:51.680\nnot I don't have any numbers right um what's your you guys heard my\n\n01:37:51.680 --> 01:38:01.400\nintelligence has a mournful melody seven it's certainly amazing music you can't\n\n01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:07.080\ndivine whether or not it's magical it's uh it's highly skilled whoever's playing\n\n01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:11.600\nit so we don't see who's playing no it's it's coming from really far away it's\n\n01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.840\nkind of a it's carrying it's kind of repetitive it's kind of a one-note song\n\n01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:20.080\nsounds like a morning zoo team we got to go we got to see this I love music I\n\n01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:26.240\nlove live music all right let's check out the music a few more minutes of travel\n\n01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:31.960\nbrings you to the edge of a very curious site a graveyard curious again within\n\n01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:37.400\nthe fence of the cemetery you can see skeletal undead creatures writhing along\n\n01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:41.880\naround the fence they're kind of inside the cemetery kind of writhing around the\n\n01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:45.760\nfence the music plays on\n\n01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.720\noccasionally this is like one of those like Disney books where you press the\n\n01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:56.920\nbutton the face um yeah so the skeletal creatures yeah inside the\n\n01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:01.320\ngraveyard occasionally you can see one of the gravestar gravestones in the\n\n01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:06.560\ncemetery topples over you're still far off and nothing's noticed you yet okay\n\n01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:12.800\neverybody get down so so so want to be clear on this what we're seeing like the\n\n01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:15.760\ndead rising for that's not why the gravestones are getting toppled over\n\n01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:18.760\nmaybe yeah that's that's kind of what it's looking at and you said they're\n\n01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:22.680\nwrithing against the fence yeah they're kind of leaning up against the fence but\n\n01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.360\nthey're not like trying to beat it down or anything they're leaning up against\n\n01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:29.760\nit you notice the cemetery is alive with movement in time with the music you can\n\n01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.000\nhear thudding and bumping they're dancing throughout the cemetery rumbling\n\n01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.720\nearth and shaking dew off of grass the the the gravestones themselves are\n\n01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:44.280\nfalling over as graves burst open and new corpses burst forth from the soil they\n\n01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:47.640\nkind of get up and pull themselves out of the ground and start wandering around\n\n01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:52.360\na little bit but after a little tiny bit of wandering around they kind of they\n\n01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:57.280\nkind of lose interest and just plop down on the soil like take a seat or like\n\n01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:01.000\nlean up against something most of them are just kind of hanging out leaning up\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:06.360\nagainst the fences this music is so good that the dead wanted they came back to\n\n01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:12.520\nlife to hear it I was full but mindless this doesn't look like something we\n\n01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:21.000\nwant to just jump into I think we should watch yeah okay do we see where the\n\n01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.680\nmusic's coming from no it's a lot louder now that you're by the graveyard but you\n\n01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:27.880\ncan't tell it's kind of like there's forest around and you can't really pin\n\n01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:33.240\npoint a location is it still sounds it's night time is it is it to what how it's\n\n01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:38.800\ncalled three in the morning misty and foggy so there's absolutely no way to\n\n01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:44.760\nknow we got people rising from their graves getting up walking around for\n\n01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:48.800\na second and then just kind of losing interest and hanging out right so\n\n01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.840\nsomebody's summoning the dead out of their out of their graves guys yeah\n\n01:40:52.840 --> 01:41:00.200\nSpencer do I have like enhanced hearing do you have perception I have\n\n01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:07.000\nperception of four you have mildly enhanced do you want to yeah yeah I use\n\n01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000\nmy hearing to see or to listen for exactly where that music's coming from\n\n01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:18.720\nall right you pinpointed it seems like there's there's a little bit of forest\n\n01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:22.680\ninterposing the graveyard and the town proper and it seems like it's coming\n\n01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:31.320\nfrom within one of the stands of trees do you guys I right it's I think the\n\n01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:37.520\nharp is coming from inside those that tree area so we go check it out let's\n\n01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.760\nlet's let's sneak up over there you guys have stuff right I got loads of\n\n01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:46.200\nstealth this guy's got loads of stealth no no I don't I don't have any stealth\n\n01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:51.360\nright you're not bone we have a five stealth okay that's good that might be\n\n01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:55.040\nthe best well I think you should check it out because if we don't want to\n\n01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:01.200\nbumble over there all right Spence I'm gonna stealthily make my way to that\n\n01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.320\ntree all right if there's any trouble come running back here okay I'm a\n\n01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:10.520\ncleric okay dealing with zombies is my thing I just don't these are my\n\n01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:15.520\nfriendly zombies let's not attack them yet we don't have time for this\n\n01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.520\nconversation they're all chilling and listening to the music man they're being\n\n01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:24.800\ncommanded by someone I did that that person probably has nefarious purposes\n\n01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:32.680\nthese are there's nothing nice about the undead they just follow orders yeah\n\n01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:38.960\ngo go sneak up and report back to us okay you attempt to sneak up but almost\n\n01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:43.280\ninstantly you hear the music abruptly stop and then from within the trees you\n\n01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:48.920\nsee a burst of ruby light and then and then nothing it's it's silent again but\n\n01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:53.240\nthe silence is quickly overtaken by the sounds of zombies not being as chilled\n\n01:42:53.240 --> 01:43:00.120\nout as they were before oh no the music Ronan making noises how close how close\n\n01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:07.520\nare Carlos and I to the zombies how far away do you want to be well I mean pretty\n\n01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:15.640\nfar yeah 50 yards okay I'll say 50 yards but Steve's much closer let's say Steve's\n\n01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:20.560\nabout 20 feet off so you guys are pretty far away kind of spying on Steve and\n\n01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:24.200\nhe's he's up trying to creep he was trying to creep kind of around or past the\n\n01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:31.160\ngraveyard and how far is that ruby light from where I was let's say 60 more than\n\n01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:40.400\n100 feet oh 100 feet mm-hmm so it's not too far no but yeah it's not too far but\n\n01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:44.400\nyeah now now the undead are starting to try and climb over the fence they're not\n\n01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.040\nthey're not very coordinated so it's hard and then others are trying to like rip\n\n01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.520\nopen the fence and break it down if we get bitten by the undead do them no\n\n01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.720\nokay they just want to kill you and absorb your life essence are they\n\n01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:03.040\ncoming for us they're certainly do they see us you can't do the yeah you guys\n\n01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:06.280\nfrom your vantage point can tell that they can see Steve because he's close\n\n01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.560\nbut you guys are apparently or it seems far enough away to be evading\n\n01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:14.320\ndetection and how many how many boogins we got right now right now there's eight\n\n01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:19.840\neight boogins we can handle eight clumsy boogins are they between me and that\n\n01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:24.320\nlike so I can't run back to no you can you're outside of the graveyard and\n\n01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:29.240\nthey're still inside the graveyard okay so they're not between me and them no\n\n01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:39.960\nthey're trying to be though oh boy all right I mean in regular Dungeons and\n\n01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:43.440\nDragons as a cleric I would have this power called turn on dead you know I\n\n01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:54.360\nthink you should have it can I see your sheet yeah turn on dead I think under\n\n01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:57.680\nfeats Spencer could I have a different loadout from last time but I've had time\n\n01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:05.080\nto reset on that yeah absolutely and okay all right fuck it well I'm down if\n\n01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:09.360\nyou are I mean let's do this I got my offensive loadout right now I'm ready to\n\n01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:19.720\nkick boogin but all right just just does this diary diarrhea looked like he's\n\n01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:24.880\nany any any danger right now he certainly seems to be like seems to be\n\n01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:28.680\nclose to in danger I mean he's certainly being threatened by undead\n\n01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:32.520\nthey're just not like surrounding him well I said we take I said we go on the\n\n01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:35.160\noffensive while they're still behind the fence and we can take some potshots\n\n01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:41.320\nat him yeah we're there's no point stealth well let's just head for Steve\n\n01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:47.960\nand help him all right well Steve should go first because he's the closest I'm\n\n01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:57.440\ngonna go toward the Ruby okay all right you do that you go you can do a double\n\n01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.760\nmove 60 feet all right you get about halfway there if you sprint you could\n\n01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:05.600\nget all the way there okay I'll sprint there all right you're winded but you\n\n01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:14.640\nget there you can smell oh it smells like murr and but you don't really see\n\n01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:18.920\nanything there's no real footprints or anything you can see there is a large\n\n01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:24.880\nlarge like stump tree stump like of a tree that's been cut down in recent\n\n01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:33.280\nhistory no just like a big old tree stump all right that's your turn one of\n\n01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:42.760\nyou guys go 50 yards that's 150 feet okay I say we get like in battle\n\n01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:46.240\nformation with DJ so that we're close together or is it better to kind of do\n\n01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:49.480\nget in flanking positions and kind of like kind of have them like because\n\n01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:53.920\nthere is a cemetery a big square enclosure or what is it it's a it's it's\n\n01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:59.360\nmostly square it's like a rectangle like how big from side to side 50 feet by\n\n01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:04.120\n30 feet okay once I get within 30 feet of all of them I have a chance to make\n\n01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:09.360\nany or all of them flee okay that's what they're still within the bounds I'll be\n\n01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:14.000\nright behind you and if I need to start throwing fire bolts I'm right behind you\n\n01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:24.400\nbecause you know I like fire all right so you're 150 feet away it's gonna take\n\n01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:30.080\nat least two turns to move into position if you sprint so okay we take that\n\n01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:34.440\nfirst sprint all right you do that you're all everyone's winded now it's\n\n01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:40.040\ngreat I mean it's tiring but it's great the undead their turn two undead come\n\n01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:43.440\nover the fence and are closing in on diarrhea but they're still not to them\n\n01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:47.640\nyet the other undead there was eight the other six undead break open the fence\n\n01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.560\nand they're starting to spill out through the side of the fence kind of now\n\n01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:59.280\nblocking off diarrhea is path to Dan and Jeff so now you're kind of surrounding\n\n01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:05.480\nthem in a way but there's more of them than you so okay now it's a let's let's\n\n01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:09.800\nlet's get these guys in the crossfire how far away from them or am I your 20\n\n01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:14.640\nfeet from the nearest to and they're moving pretty slowly yeah these are\n\n01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:24.880\nthese are slow moving a dead they they move very slowly zombies if you want to\n\n01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:29.880\nthink we can make someone else's no no I want to I want to take out my bow and\n\n01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:38.600\ngo for some headshots you know from your clerical experience that headshots\n\n01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.960\ndon't kill zombies like in the walking dead they don't one shot at least I mean\n\n01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.880\nthere's still it's damages damage but it's not what do I know well they're\n\n01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:50.960\nmagic so you know you just kind of have to destroy the corpse all right well\n\n01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:56.680\nthen I go for the easiest body part to hit all right Center of Mass what's your\n\n01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:10.200\nattack bonus plus five okay time three for a crit what's the damage remember\n\n01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:15.800\nanyone shit I used to know all this where does it say that oh 128 plus two is\n\n01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:28.240\nthat possible one one D8 one D8 yeah listen then to people read all right\n\n01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:36.120\nlow-key low-key episode yeah whatever you slice one of the zombies in half he\n\n01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:42.840\ngoes down with an arrow oh wait you're shooting him okay my bow you don't you\n\n01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:49.880\nshoot him it barely affects him damn it oh man well sinks right into his soft\n\n01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:53.720\nzombie flesh should use that sword Jack yeah that's what I thought was happening\n\n01:49:53.720 --> 01:50:02.760\nmy bad that's okay all right Dan and or Jeff take it in well my goal is to get\n\n01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:09.920\nwithin 30 feet of as many of these guys as possible so you can do that but you\n\n01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:14.960\ncan't also act like you can sprint the rest of the way but you can't sprint and\n\n01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:19.720\nthen yeah yeah well so I'll spend this term positioning myself great you do\n\n01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:24.280\nthat you put yourself into what you think will be exactly the space that the\n\n01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:29.280\nzombies will be able to move into on their turn okay I guess I guess I do the\n\n01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:36.280\nsame thing it's tactically sound all right the zombies they they come very\n\n01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.800\nclose to you but they can't you know you really measured it right what's our\n\n01:50:40.800 -->
