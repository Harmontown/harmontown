Well, it's a it's a hard to explain\n\n11:16.200 --> 11:22.920\nYeah, yeah, it's a two-man show, but there's actually nine to ten nine to ten people right that help us out\n\n11:22.920 --> 11:29.680\nAnd like six six of them are attractive young women that yes hip-hop interstitials all dressed in black, right?\n\n11:30.120 --> 11:33.760\nYeah, so you're in the kitchen now. He wants a plate\n\n11:34.320 --> 11:36.880\nYou can have it a plate if you don't have pain\n\n11:36.880 --> 11:40.000\nHey, you haven't seen the show\n\n11:42.800 --> 11:44.800\nBut whatever\n\n11:45.600 --> 11:47.600\nWe'll just\n\n11:48.400 --> 11:52.400\nThe third yeah, we'll deal with the plate. You have me the plate. You fucked it up. You fucked it up on purpose\n\n11:52.680 --> 11:55.440\nAll right, we'll skip to the third. Okay. Okay, great. Oh\n\n11:56.200 --> 11:59.840\nOh, okay, this is a plate because my hand is straight Rob\n\n12:00.600 --> 12:06.080\nThank you so much for this plate that you gave me take it.

Yeah, it's stuck to his hand and\n\n12:23.120 --> 12:25.120\nand it's\n\n12:25.440 --> 12:28.120\nThis show has run for five years. Yeah\n\n12:28.880 --> 12:30.880\nOff off off Broadway\n\n12:30.880 --> 12:37.760\nIt's presented as if that's a magic trick when I saw the show and I did see it right and in my defense Tim Conway\n\n12:37.760 --> 12:42.360\nWas playing the part I was doing right. He was the understudy. Yeah, so maybe I laid it on too thick for you\n\n12:42.360 --> 12:48.960\nBut yeah, it's not a good show the the thing is that you present the plate stuck to the hand as if it's like a\n\n12:49.240 --> 12:54.600\nMagical thing, but yeah, that scene comes after 20 minutes of those six girls dancing, right?\n\n12:55.120 --> 12:59.680\nIt's plenty of time to glue a plate to your hand. Yeah, but but as you but we\n\n12:59.680 --> 13:07.560\nBut we didn't use any glue. No. Yeah, it's it's actually it's enough time to make a special plate with a hand strap on it\n\n13:07.960 --> 13:13.520\nBut we didn't do that. We have a whole thing. Well, like we don't we're not miming spaghetti\n\n13:13.520 --> 13:17.080\nIt's like we're doing now. We're using real spagetti\n\n13:17.080 --> 13:23.600\nIt's enough time enough time passes that we did but Dan we didn't do that. Yeah, we didn't do that\n\n13:23.600 --> 13:28.480\nYou don't give it a strap. We didn't use a glue. We just had a plate and it was stuck on my hand\n\n13:28.480 --> 13:33.120\nWe didn't do anything. Why don't you just come see the show man? I saw it\n\n13:33.920 --> 13:39.560\nAgain, why don't you come see the show again? Why did you see it right? You got to see it\n\n13:39.840 --> 13:43.240\nYou see it all see the show through the better eyes\n\n13:44.160 --> 13:50.600\nThen you've seen it. We didn't you don't understand it was a real trick. Yeah, by the way the night I came to the show\n\n13:50.600 --> 13:52.600\nThey were doing this to strangers in the lobby\n\n13:52.600 --> 13:58.600\nWell, hey, it's been running for five years like the blue man group in a way\n\n13:58.600 --> 14:01.160\nYeah, the show starts when you get into the lobby\n\n14:01.680 --> 14:06.960\nNo, wait, no, it's and there are shows where there's a show a Rob\n\n14:07.400 --> 14:13.240\nThat's this show is in Vegas.

Yeah, York, Chicago\n\n14:32.680 --> 14:36.360\nIt's a little bit watered down. Yeah, then the original stuff. That's true\n\n14:36.360 --> 14:44.360\nI heard you guys had a more hardcore version of your show before you guys started playing big markets. Yeah. Yeah, that's right\n\n14:44.360 --> 14:46.360\nYeah, yeah, you heard that you\n\n14:46.360 --> 14:53.800\nI mean who didn't hear that.

It's really\n\n15:15.280 --> 15:22.160\nYou're gonna you're gonna because it's out of context. I get it like but you shouldn't but that's why I say it's your choice\n\n15:22.160 --> 15:24.160\nIf you want to do it\n\n15:24.560 --> 15:27.080\nI mean, I guess yeah, we won't we can now\n\n15:29.560 --> 15:31.560\nNo, I guess we want it's really racist\n\n15:33.440 --> 15:38.160\nHey, why why Dan why stage picture stage picture\n\n15:38.160 --> 15:44.800\nHey, this is why we have a big feud why he doesn't know how to\n\n15:46.120 --> 15:51.080\nWhy why why by the cow why by the cow why by the cow\n\n15:51.800 --> 15:58.880\nThe name of the scene by the cow.

Okay, he hates all brightness and sunlight\n\n29:04.720 --> 29:09.560\nHe hates that. He just doesn't want any bright light. I don't like it\n\n29:09.560 --> 29:15.760\nWell, it it hurt your eyes that room where the light comes out. That's the room where he keeps all of his joy. Yeah\n\n29:16.280 --> 29:21.040\nYeah, and he has to pull that shade down to make sure no joy escape. I'm not a big daylight guy\n\n29:21.040 --> 29:26.760\nHe doesn't like Sun doesn't like sunshine. I caught you know what I call the Sun. What yellow Hitler?\n\n29:29.720 --> 29:31.720\nThat's two times. I don't like it it\n\n29:35.040 --> 29:37.040\nIt seeks to\n\n29:37.040 --> 29:39.600\nInvade and annex my my life\n\n29:40.120 --> 29:45.680\nI'm like, I'd be so much happier just working like at night. I would I'd understand that the Sun is\n\n29:46.320 --> 29:48.880\nimportant on some levels\n\n29:48.880 --> 29:53.840\nTo life on earth, right? I do get that. Okay, but\n\n29:54.840 --> 30:00.480\nPersonally, I find it offensive. I really do. It's bright and hot and it's ridiculous\n\n30:00.480 --> 30:07.600\nSo but if you if you went into a room and someone had put a giant ball of flaming gas in the corner\n\n30:07.840 --> 30:10.760\nYou would be like can can someone deal with this?\n\n30:11.080 --> 30:15.840\nBut don't you get don't you get depressed like I'm from Chicago and if I don't get enough sunlight\n\n30:15.840 --> 30:19.600\nI get that seasonal effect disorder. You don't get depressed at all. I'm too narcissistic\n\n30:19.600 --> 30:23.160\nThe the Sun doesn't cheer me up. It competes with me\n\n30:26.280 --> 30:28.920\nI don't wow I don't get depressed I\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:35.320\nGet depressed when the Sun starts fucking fucking up my shit. Get out of here yellow Hitler\n\n30:35.320 --> 30:41.000\nWhat do you want? And it's like I've been here for eight billion years. I'm like, oh, what I thought I'll pull off\n\n30:41.240 --> 30:43.000\nI'll take your word for it\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nWhat have you done for me lately?\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nThere's a new Sun in town\n\n30:48.760 --> 30:52.240\nAll right, so that's your secret. It's just being narcissistic\n\n30:52.240 --> 30:57.440\nI don't know. I genuinely like I have a vitamin D deficiency. I just got diagnosed with it began\n\n30:57.440 --> 31:00.560\nIt's probably obviously because you hate yellow Hitler\n\n31:00.560 --> 31:06.200\nI really are a very sensitive to light and heat and stuff. I'd rather be hot than cold\n\n31:06.200 --> 31:12.320\nBut I just you know, I like I'm with Dan. I don't like the Sun either. I don't like going out doing things. I\n\n31:12.320 --> 31:14.320\nI\n\n31:14.720 --> 31:23.520\nassociate I associate the outdoors with a lot of rigamarole like just a lot of just a lot of non-commodore 64 programming a\n\n31:24.080 --> 31:27.480\nLot of a lot of just like why can't you hit this ball with this stick?\n\n31:27.480 --> 31:31.520\nWhat's wrong with you? And there's no like give me a typewriter\n\n31:32.160 --> 31:39.160\nLike it's a it just it's just like it's bright and it's like everything out there is fake and and bullshit and like\n\n31:39.160 --> 31:46.120\nWhen you're your dad survived the polio epidemic and he so he has one withered leg and those moments when he does try out of\n\n31:46.120 --> 31:49.720\nFather guilt to take you in the front yard and throw the baseball with you\n\n31:49.720 --> 31:54.240\nIt's like really embarrassing and that's like I associate the Sun with social anxiety\n\n31:55.520 --> 31:57.520\nguilt shame\n\n31:57.520 --> 32:03.280\nBullying recess was the worst like as bad as school was it was like the bell would ring and everyone would go\n\n32:03.280 --> 32:07.400\nYay, we get to go outside and play more baseball than in gym class\n\n32:07.400 --> 32:10.520\nyou fucking assholes I\n\n32:11.240 --> 32:17.360\nWould just find the darkest like bush that I could find and like there'd be two other kids in there\n\n32:17.360 --> 32:20.720\nAnd they'd go did you see Jaws again? Yeah, I did I\n\n32:21.400 --> 32:25.360\nSaw it as much as I fucking good. I can't wait to watch Jaws again\n\n32:26.080 --> 32:31.320\nSo so turning all the lights out at three o'clock in the afternoon you're recreating your childhood basically\n\n32:31.320 --> 32:39.600\nI'm crooked. Yeah, I'm trying to deprive my senses and enter a more comfortable zone. I hid under my bed until I was 24\n\n32:43.480 --> 32:45.480\nDid you see Rob's biopic powder\n\n32:46.080 --> 32:51.760\nYeah, yes.

I know there's a there's a bidding war going on right now\n\n33:29.680 --> 33:31.680\nYeah, that's why I'm out here in LA\n\n33:33.040 --> 33:37.600\nWhat you can yeah, what's yours?

No rights to the ending number of Rob\n\n34:00.120 --> 34:04.440\nMaybe for a weekend. We could do like a weekend run. Yeah, we could do like a limited run\n\n34:04.440 --> 34:07.280\nYeah, I can do that, but me and Schrab would do it\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:12.560\nRight. Yeah, is it fair to you can play David Cross's part. Thank you\n\n34:14.120 --> 34:19.240\nGod what if there's a reason it's possible to get David Cross's like in here right now. Oh\n\n34:19.240 --> 34:24.200\nGod if David Cross is listen watching if he walked in and it was subscriber\n\n34:24.200 --> 34:28.840\nThe the special effects from time cop would start happening and you guys would all start turning into pudding\n\n34:30.400 --> 34:36.120\nWhat is that what you're trying to do to me right now?

What is\n\n34:53.520 --> 34:56.560\nLike what is the when you teach an improv class?\n\n34:57.560 --> 35:00.040\nWhat's the what is the first thing you start with timing?\n\n35:07.600 --> 35:09.600\nYes, I start with timing\n\n35:09.600 --> 35:12.000\nI\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:17.600\nCan't do you ever to do teach people just off the street anymore or do you just know I've become\n\n35:18.160 --> 35:24.120\nThat good I don't have to teach off the street anymore. You just you just you just teach but you teach people that pay Dan\n\n35:24.120 --> 35:28.280\nThat's what I'm looking for Jimmy. What where do you teach? What where in Chicago? I teach?\n\n35:28.280 --> 35:33.280\nI actually teach for myself. I teach it stage 773 and green shirt studio\n\n35:33.800 --> 35:38.640\nYeah, do you do like like I'm assuming long form because you're Chicago. Yes, I do long form. Yes\n\n35:38.640 --> 35:43.400\nIs it do you do the heraldy thing or do you do your own like just let let things be what they are?\n\n35:43.400 --> 35:48.560\nI do I do something called the artist low comedy, which is basically let's just be let's you know\n\n35:49.120 --> 35:54.680\nSlow it down a little not trying to be funny and it's just gonna it'll happen. It's listening right exactly\n\n35:55.400 --> 35:57.400\nWhat did you say exactly?\n\n35:58.720 --> 36:03.520\nDo people know people know you have an improv background you go all the way back to comedy sports in Milwaukee\n\n36:03.520 --> 36:05.520\nIt's all yet. Well, that's where we met\n\n36:05.520 --> 36:11.360\nIt's short form though, but I always when I go to see it. Well, what I want one thing I wanted to ask you, okay?\n\n36:12.080 --> 36:16.960\nBecause I think this is important like because like if you're you're in Chicago\n\n36:16.960 --> 36:20.320\nYou're at the epicenter of long good long-form improv\n\n36:20.960 --> 36:28.760\nIn LA where it's not necessarily a you know, but but but but you tell tell these kids listening if they live in LA\n\n36:29.160 --> 36:33.480\nWhere would you recommend they go if they want to see the in your opinion?\n\n36:33.480 --> 36:38.080\nJust like creme de la creme long-form improv in Chicago or Los Angeles, Los Angeles\n\n36:38.080 --> 36:42.880\nOh Los Angeles. I think the UCB is got is is is just great\n\n36:43.440 --> 36:46.920\nRob do they still do they do ask it right?\n\n36:46.920 --> 36:53.120\nYeah, they do every Sunday night, and then I think competing with this show there. There's some shows at the Iowa West\n\n36:53.880 --> 37:00.560\nWeird dance with Bob Dassey and Stephanie where they're a dasa risky, which is he was on community Craig Kikowski\n\n37:00.560 --> 37:06.600\nRich, Tolerico and Bob. They're the best improvisers those three. Yeah. Yeah, I think yeah\n\n37:06.600 --> 37:09.840\nI saw Stephanie where do I think with that? You know Joe bill?\n\n37:10.240 --> 37:12.240\nYes, yeah from Chicago\n\n37:12.640 --> 37:18.480\nMark Sutton the bass prof. Yeah, was two two guys sitting in a fake boat and just talk forever\n\n37:18.480 --> 37:24.160\nAnd Stephanie where it came on and she absolutely killed it and they asked me to be honest like no, I'm scared\n\n37:24.160 --> 37:31.400\nYeah, because like that's that's really like ballsy improv. I did a show with Stephanie years ago at cold naked\n\n37:31.400 --> 37:36.120\nIt was just two of us. We did one long scene. It was in your apartment. Yes\n\n37:37.840 --> 37:40.480\nThe laws the laws were different back then Dan\n\n37:41.720 --> 37:48.240\nIt's a long form long form bathtub scene. Yeah. Yeah, but there was no light. There's no lighting. It was dark\n\n37:48.240 --> 37:56.680\nYou would have liked but it was she was the she was one of the best improvisers I've ever worked with yeah\n\n37:57.280 --> 37:58.280\nthe\n\n37:58.280 --> 38:00.440\nthe amount of like self-control and\n\n38:01.320 --> 38:04.240\nfor real listening and eye contact and\n\n38:04.960 --> 38:11.440\nLetting things build based on like absolute attention is really amazing. There's not something\n\n38:11.880 --> 38:13.880\nWhy I was talking\n\n38:13.880 --> 38:16.880\nReverse\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:23.280\nThere is it is it's about listening because when I watch long form improv and people are good at it\n\n38:23.280 --> 38:28.880\nI'm like, how the fuck like like there's no I can only think about one thing at once and\n\n38:29.240 --> 38:32.760\nAt a time and like like for instance how to construct a sentence\n\n38:35.280 --> 38:39.080\nBut if when I'm offstage in those moments of him doing it\n\n38:39.080 --> 38:46.880\nIt's like I can't I'm like if somebody says like this is great soup and then I'm like soup soup soup soup dot connecting soup\n\n38:46.880 --> 38:52.400\nAnd then like they're talking about all kinds of shit the other person saying something like you have to actually absorb it and process it\n\n38:52.400 --> 38:58.320\nThe same things that make you good at long-form improv are the things that that that probably make you a good person in like a conversation\n\n38:59.920 --> 39:06.400\nI know some great long-form improv is that I wouldn't call like great like socially like interactive people like this\n\n39:06.400 --> 39:10.280\nyou there is an ability to like really focus and\n\n39:12.080 --> 39:17.720\nAlso, you can be any kind of person and be good at long-form improv. I think and here's another rule about long-form improv\n\n39:18.160 --> 39:20.160\nAlways let the guests speak\n\n39:20.920 --> 39:22.920\nThey can that's why it's why I'm sorry\n\n39:25.400 --> 39:29.680\nNo, but you're like for me like for the podcast improv nerd\n\n39:29.680 --> 39:34.560\nI've had I've interviewed over like 180 people and and I don't you know\n\n39:34.560 --> 39:41.120\nI don't have a journalist. Well, everybody has but yeah, 180 noteworthy people. Yes. Yes. Thank you dad\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:45.080\nAnd of course I got into podcasting for the money, you know\n\n39:45.080 --> 39:50.960\nYes, I went from public radio, and I'm like, you know what this podcasting there's more money than public radio\n\n39:50.960 --> 39:53.280\nThey should call it cha-ching castig. Yes, they're really\n\n39:54.640 --> 39:56.640\nThat sounds racist one\n\n39:58.640 --> 40:01.520\nSlightly racist that's why they don't do it. I think that's my theory\n\n40:01.520 --> 40:06.040\nYeah, but you're podcasting so you can get away with racist stuff that you can't get on terrestrial radio\n\n40:06.080 --> 40:11.200\nYou get away with it. It's demanded of me. Yes. Yeah, they're well if I don't feed these people racism though\n\n40:11.200 --> 40:13.480\nThey'll go over to Marin. Yeah, exactly\n\n40:14.120 --> 40:20.800\nPeople were lined up in front tonight like we want more race. We want it. I didn't want to tell you this but that's what they're looking for build that wall\n\n40:20.800 --> 40:26.520\nYeah, baby drill. Yeah, Harmon Harmon Harmon because you're gonna come out and endorse Trump in a couple minutes\n\n40:26.520 --> 40:31.400\nDid I give it away? I've got look. I've been endorsing him since he was in Pizza Hut commercials. I\n\n40:32.200 --> 40:37.940\nSaid I was like, can we elect him to do all pizza commercials? Why does he have to be just Pete Pizza Hut? Right?\n\n40:38.640 --> 40:42.940\nI was I was the first person to sign the make him orange er\n\n40:44.120 --> 40:48.800\nPetition, right? I want him to be so orange that he's a literal orange\n\n40:48.800 --> 40:56.080\nYeah, is it okay to say that tonight's proceeds are going to his campaign? Absolutely. If you stepped in this building you helped him\n\n40:57.760 --> 41:00.840\nTake over the world and kill minorities. Yeah\n\n41:02.720 --> 41:04.720\nUntil minorities\n\n41:05.040 --> 41:06.640\nkill\n\n41:06.640 --> 41:09.880\nMinorities it feels bad when you make me repeat it.

I\n\n41:16.080 --> 41:19.200\nDon't even want to say it because I would feel really bad\n\n41:19.800 --> 41:23.560\nCan I share something what happened when I flew into for this show?\n\n41:24.080 --> 41:29.520\nCan I yes, you can all right flew in for this show?

Yeah, we've been waiting for you. Yeah\n\n42:13.240 --> 42:16.440\nSo I say, you know what you got a problem and she goes\n\n42:18.840 --> 42:21.640\nShe goes well, we hope not all right\n\n42:22.440 --> 42:27.960\nBoth sides of this conversation are ill right you guys were both saying exactly the wrong things right\n\n42:27.960 --> 42:34.880\nDo we have a problem? I hope not right, right? So\n\n42:36.320 --> 42:40.800\nSo I go back to the you know, they take me all the way back to where the bathrooms are at the back of the plane\n\n42:40.800 --> 42:42.800\nAnd now it's three\n\n42:42.800 --> 42:46.480\nFlight attendants and she's the head so hot dear penthouse\n\n42:46.480 --> 42:56.720\nAnd so I want to die because my dick's so big that's the detail you left out\n\n42:58.960 --> 43:03.560\nCould you can I need a character witness at court so if in case I'm gonna call you\n\n43:04.240 --> 43:11.720\nSo it also when it went I was also I had my my phone out my what is this dick your dick\n\n43:11.720 --> 43:18.800\nYou can say dick. Okay. I thought as a podcast you know, no you can say anything so I had my my iPhone out\n\n43:18.800 --> 43:26.040\nAnd I was timing myself so she goes all right someone complained that you had written you you want to die and\n\n43:26.720 --> 43:30.000\nWhy did you have your your cell phone out on a timer?\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:35.120\nAnd I said because I was meditating which was a total which was totally true\n\n43:36.080 --> 43:38.560\nShe says well, you know, this is really serious whatever\n\n43:38.560 --> 43:41.960\nSo I go back and I sit in the I sit back in in my seat\n\n43:41.960 --> 43:46.400\nAnd I like I know the Pete the guy who's doing it, but I don't want to make eye contact\n\n43:46.400 --> 43:52.320\nWait, can you can you rewind because I just in that moment which is really crucial because they summoned you back\n\n43:52.320 --> 43:57.320\nAnd they said all that stuff and you're you're getting to a destination in the story, but at that moment\n\n43:57.320 --> 44:02.080\nWhat the fuck good question like like you wrote this and why are you telling me I was meditating and then\n\n44:02.600 --> 44:06.120\nShe's like well, this is a big deal and then you go back to your seat like\n\n44:06.120 --> 44:11.880\nHow did that conversation really there's some suicidal thoughts in there Dan and then there's like oh my god\n\n44:11.880 --> 44:13.920\nWhat the fuck have I done? No, what is she said?\n\n44:13.920 --> 44:16.640\nWell, what is happening in that moment that before you go back to your seat?\n\n44:16.640 --> 44:20.240\nI'm like as much dialogue as you can remember of that see is I'm going back to the seat\n\n44:20.240 --> 44:24.880\nNo, no before you go back to the seat before I these people have summoned you from your seat\n\n44:24.880 --> 44:29.920\nOh, okay.

59:22.400\nShe's fine.\n\n59:22.400 --> 59:23.400\nShe has a parachute.\n\n59:23.400 --> 59:27.400\nIt's going to be okay.\n\n59:27.400 --> 59:41.080\nWe were at a low altitude, she's going to be alright.\n\n59:41.080 --> 59:43.160\nHello?\n\n59:43.160 --> 59:44.160\nNatalie?\n\n59:44.160 --> 59:51.720\nThis is Samantha, I think.\n\n59:51.720 --> 59:52.720\nOr maybe Rebecca?\n\n59:52.720 --> 59:53.720\nI'm not sure.\n\n59:53.720 --> 59:54.720\nStacey, possibly.\n\n59:54.720 --> 59:55.720\nMaybe Stacey.\n\n59:55.720 --> 59:56.720\nHello, yes?\n\n59:56.720 --> 59:57.720\nAre you falling much?\n\n59:57.720 --> 59:58.720\nI'm falling.\n\n59:58.720 --> 59:59.720\nI'm falling.\n\n59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.720\nBut this parachute, there's something written on it.\n\n01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.720\nOh, for...\n\n01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:10.720\nOh, this is so real nice.\n\n01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.720\nJust real nice.\n\n01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.720\nReal nice.\n\n01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:21.280\nI bet you think you're pretty cool now, stopping time, being cool now.\n\n01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.680\nI tried to help you.\n\n01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.480\nI tried to help you with your disfigurement.\n\n01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.880\nWere you trying to help me?\n\n01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.880\nYeah.\n\n01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:33.680\nI said to the pilot, you should watch Bojack Horseman, and you were like, that's stupid.\n\n01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.080\nAnd you were like undercutting me.\n\n01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.880\nAnd I said, you should watch a basket.\n\n01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.760\nAnd you were like, that's stupid.\n\n01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:49.320\nYou don't have good taste in comedy, and now you're going to have great taste in pavement.\n\n01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.640\nI guess you win.\n\n01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.040\nI guess you win.\n\n01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.320\nYou don't guess I win.\n\n01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320\nI guess you win.\n\n01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320\nI guess you win.\n\n01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.320\nI guess...\n\n01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.320\nWhat are you going to do with all that...\n\n01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.320\nThat win?\n\n01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.320\nWhat are you going to do with that?\n\n01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320\nWin now?\n\n01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320\nYou're going to...\n\n01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.880\nYou're going to buy a smile with that?\n\n01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.880\nProbably not.\n\n01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.320\nBecause you're a big, fat piece of shit and no one likes.\n\n01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.480\nYou're a big, fat piece of shit and no one likes.\n\n01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.240\nAnd all the customers hate you too.\n\n01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.240\nThey tell me...\n\n01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.840\nTell me that you're a big, fat piece of shit.\n\n01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.840\nYou're a piece of shit.\n\n01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:27.840\nStop time for her!\n\n01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:41.320\nFeel the air marshal cabinet.\n\n01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320\nPoint break.\n\n01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.320\nPoint break.\n\n01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:49.800\nPoint break.\n\n01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.800\nStop time for me too!\n\n01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:12.800\nResume time for both of us!\n\n01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.720\nThree hours later.\n\n01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.240\nSo what do you make of this, Sergeant?\n\n01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:27.760\nLooks to me like a girl, man and another girl, shot her, both exploded.\n\n01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:34.640\nBut don't you think it all kind of started with that guy who kind of made a weird suicide\n\n01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.320\nnote on the plane?\n\n01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.960\nDon't know what you're talking about.\n\n01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.920\nLike in this municipality, just underneath the...\n\n01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:49.040\nIsn't anybody concerned also that this plane was being captained by a guy named Captain\n\n01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.760\nAwesome and Captain Evil?\n\n01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.320\nWhat kind of business are we running here?\n\n01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.800\nI didn't know there were planes involved.\n\n01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.240\nI'm Woody Harrelson.\n\n01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:06.240\nAnd I'm Pineapple.\n\n01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:16.480\nAnd with all due God damn respect, Pineapple, why don't you either just do the God damn\n\n01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:22.040\npolice work or shoot my job.\n\n01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:26.440\nIt's in the way that you use it.\n\n01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.920\nThose are the credits.\n\n01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.040\nSo Jimmy, is that how it happened?\n\n01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.040\nJimmy, great that, great that.\n\n01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.040\nI'm going to ask Rod something.\n\n01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.040\nI'm going to ask you something.\n\n01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.920\nHow many times do you think we could have edited that?\n\n01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920\nOh, Jesus.\n\n01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.680\nI was like, oh my God, let's edit here.\n\n01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.120\nIs that what you do as an instructor?\n\n01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.120\nYou're like...\n\n01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.120\nYeah, well...\n\n01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.120\nYou edit it.\n\n01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.280\nYou stop the scene at a point where it really begged to be ended.\n\n01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.280\nYeah.\n\n01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.280\nAnd I think we did...\n\n01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.240\nI mean, it was amazing because we like ran over the body like five, six, seven, eight\n\n01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.240\ntimes.\n\n01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.240\nIt was amazing.\n\n01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.800\nBecause like in long form, once it hits, right?\n\n01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800\nYeah.\n\n01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.840\nThe laugh cannot go any higher.\n\n01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.560\nIt's so easy, you just run across the scene like that.\n\n01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.560\nRight.\n\n01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.560\nAnd it's done.\n\n01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.560\nRight.\n\n01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.560\nYeah, but then you got to get up.\n\n01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.560\nWe could have just done something like that.\n\n01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.560\nThen you got to get up and walk.\n\n01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.560\nNo, I know.\n\n01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:23.760\nSo you're trying to tell me a lady stopping time while her arch enemy is six feet above\n\n01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:29.200\nthe pavement so that she can dive down with a gun, freeze time for herself next to the\n\n01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.880\nbody, and then unfreeze time for both of them so that she can have the pleasure of blowing\n\n01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.560\nher friend's brains out before they both hit the pavement.\n\n01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.400\nThat wasn't worth 95 minutes of terrible improv.\n\n01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.200\nLet's say I'm Jimmy Crane, everybody.\n\n01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.200\nOh, Jimmy!\n\n01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.200\nThank you.\n\n01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.200\nThank you so much.\n\n01:04:50.200 -->

01:05:08.800\nWell, guys!\n\n01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800\nThat was a hell of a scene!\n\n01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800\nYou like that?\n\n01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:26.800\nI thought, I mean, I was, my suspense, I was with you to the end, you know?\n\n01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.800\nI played a character named Pineapple.\n\n01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.520\nOh, I heard the name of your character, and I thought it was believably your name, you\n\n01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.520\nknow?\n\n01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.000\nI just thought, like, the way you effect it, it was mostly, it was a lot of what you're\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000\ndoing with me.\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nI really appreciate that.\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nYeah, you're welcome.\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.480\nCameron, do you think that scene suffered from any structure problems, or do you think\n\n01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.480\nthat the whole time?\n\n01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.480\nNo, I don't.\n\n01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:53.240\nI will say that I was watching some of it on a little TV in there, and there was also\n\n01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:58.800\njust, like, I don't know if you guys realize how much the three of you just look like a\n\n01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.800\nlittle team.\n\n01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.640\nYou talked about that.\n\n01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.680\nJust, like, three little, just, you know what I mean, just, and you were on your own vibe\n\n01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:11.600\nand that was cool, but it was just, like, a, just, a real, what do you mean?\n\n01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:15.680\nIt was just a real, I think what I'm saying is it just looked like a real sitcom, you\n\n01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.680\nknow what I mean?\n\n01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:17.680\nYeah.\n\n01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.680\nJust a bunch of dudes.\n\n01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.680\nSo Esposito.\n\n01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.920\nA bunch of similar white dudes, but it was

in.\n\n01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.320\nSome of them were black.\n\n01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.320\nThey were two black.\n\n01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.320\nPineapple.\n\n01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.320\nThank God.\n\n01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.320\nPineapple was a woman.\n\n01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.320\nNo, I know.\n\n01:06:38.320 -->

Material.\n\n01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.040\nI just thought I'd randomly bring those.\n\n01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.040\nYou should.\n\n01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:01.400\nThat is not, of course that's not why I'm here.\n\n01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.480\nI did not specifically, it's called Marriage Material.\n\n01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.480\nMarriage Material.\n\n01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.920\nIsn't that

01:08:01.040\nBut you guys were, were you cohabitating before that?\n\n01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.040\nYes.\n\n01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.040\nYeah.\n\n01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.040\nLiving together.\n\n01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.040\nNot to enforce the stereotype.\n\n01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.040\nNo, right.\n\n01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:13.040\nWell, I mean, we are lesbians, but we waited to live together until marriage.\n\n01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.040\nHow many golden retrievers do you guys have?\n\n01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.040\nWe just have one, but he's so small.\n\n01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.040\nHe only weighs eight pounds.\n\n01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.040\nHe's a teeny little guy.\n\n01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.040\nIs there, like, I mean, it's probably too early to tell us the answer, but once you're,\n\n01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.040\nonce you're under the same roof and you guys are both doing the same thing, like, do you,\n\n01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:36.040\ndo you ever worry about like that?\n\n01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040\nIt's a major problem.\n\n01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040\nCompetition.\n\n01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.040\nI'm not kidding at all.\n\n01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040\nIt's a major problem.\n\n01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040\nI had a girlfriend once.\n\n01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:49.040\nLike 1999, I had a, I had a TV pilot and as a writer, she had a TV pilot at the same\n\n01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:56.040\nnetwork and we both, we saw it coming and I sat her down and was like, look, it's absolutely\n\n01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.040\nimpossible that both of our pilots are going to go.\n\n01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.040\nHopefully both of our pilots don't go.\n\n01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.040\nWhat if one of our pilots goes and the other one doesn't?\n\n01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.040\nLet's consider that possibility now and make some rules.\n\n01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:12.040\nAnd then in my head, I now, looking back, I realized that when I was having that talk\n\n01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:18.040\nwith her, I was only doing it to prepare her for the absolute inevitability that my pilot\n\n01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.040\nwas going to go and hers wasn't.\n\n01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.040\nHer pilot was Malcolm in the middle.\n\n01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.040\nOh.\n\n01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:33.040\nMine was Heat Vision and Jack and I couldn't fucking handle it.\n\n01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:37.040\nI was like, I'm out of here.\n\n01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.040\nSo I'm wondering, like two stand-ups, like, let me say Roof, like, do you worry?\n\n01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.040\nIt's a lot of Malcolm's, it for sure is.\n\n01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.040\nDo you guys talk about that?\n\n01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.040\nWe talk about it all the time.\n\n01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.040\nI mean, I've known her, we met doing stand-ups.\n\n01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:53.040\nSo I knew, you know, I mean, obviously I knew this was what was always going to happen.\n\n01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:59.040\nI will say the positive and those of you that have ever seen Rhea Performer, if you know\n\n01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.040\nher, she's, I mean, just brilliant, she's a brilliant comic.\n\n01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.040\nYoup!\n\n01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.040\nYoup!\n\n01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.040\nYoup!\n\n01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.040\nCameron, there's one of our fans who says youp a lot.\n\n01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040\nIs that true?\n\n01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.040\nIt means he likes it.\n\n01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.040\nOkay, great.\n\n01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.040\nIt's like snarf, uh, thundercats.\n\n01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.040\nRight.\n\n01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.040\nTo put it in lesbian terms.\n\n01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.040\nWait, when I met, we never say snarf, but we do snarf a lot.\n\n01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.040\nWhen I met, uh, when I met Rhea, we were wearing the same Wolverine boots.\n\n01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.040\nYeah.\n\n01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.040\nAnd I was like, hey, we're wearing the same boots.\n\n01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.040\nYeah.\n\n01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.040\nAnd she was like, yeah.\n\n01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.040\nAnd we started talking about the care of our boots.\n\n01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.040\nAnd then Karen said, she's like, every dude that meets Rhea talks about boots.\n\n01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.040\nIt is for them.\n\n01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.040\nAnd I was like, oh, shit.\n\n01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:57.040\nWell, do you know what is actually a, no, it's actually awesome to see because she is,\n\n01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:03.040\nlike on the spectrum of human people, she is like real, she's in a real James Dean area.\n\n01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.040\nAnd so dudes, I like,\n\n01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.040\nI felt cool because I was wearing the same boots.\n\n01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.040\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.040\nDude, she's like, she's either aspirational for men or men are flirting with her, but\n\n01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040\nI was kind of flirting with her.\n\n01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040\nIn a homoerotic way.\n\n01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040\nI was.\n\n01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.040\nIt's like, dude, I can just see dudes like,\n\n01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.040\nShe's also super hot.\n\n01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.040\nYeah.\n\n01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.040\nThank you.\n\n01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.040\nShe's pretty looking.\n\n01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.040\nYeah.\n\n01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.040\nShe's beautiful.\n\n01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.040\nShe has, she has cool style.\n\n01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.040\nYou have cool styles.\n\n01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.040\nYeah.\n\n01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.040\nRight.\n\n01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.040\nWe still have to iron out those rules.\n\n01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.040\nBut by the way, I'm trying.\n\n01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.040\nI don't know what the etiquette is.\n\n01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.040\nYour wife's hot.\n\n01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.040\nShe's hot.\n\n01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.040\nShe's hot.\n\n01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.040\nNo, that's okay.\n\n01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.040\nIt still feels like a wild west.\n\n01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.040\nI will say, I mean, yeah, fucking she's hot.\n\n01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.040\nI'll fucking take that all day long.\n\n01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.040\nSure.\n\n01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.040\nWhat an insult.\n\n01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.040\nAnd you vowed to wear this great boots.\n\n01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040\nHow do you say that?\n\n01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.040\nCan I ask you a personal question?\n\n01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.040\nYeah.\n\n01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.040\nWhen you guys are snarling, how does that work?\n\n01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.040\nWhat does snarling entail?\n\n01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:08.040\nSo what it is, is we'll be right in the middle of looking to each other's eyes.\n\n01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.040\nAnd then we'll call a dude, whoever.\n\n01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.040\nAny dude.\n\n01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:17.040\nGuy on the street, our oldest friend.\n\n01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.040\nAnd then he comes over.\n\n01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.040\nAnd then we fuck him.\n\n01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.040\nSnarling?\n\n01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.040\nYou guys.\n\n01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.040\nWhat is snarling?\n\n01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.040\nI am not going to explain lesbian sex to you.\n\n01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:35.040\nThere was a lot of you that thought that I was serious.\n\n01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.040\nThere's, there's, there may be a snarling a thing.\n\n01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.040\nIs that?\n\n01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040\nNo.\n\n01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040\nThat's the point.\n\n01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.040\nSnarling is a character from Denicats.\n\n01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.040\nYeah.\n\n01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.040\nOkay, is that a thing?\n\n01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040\nYeah.\n\n01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.040\nThat's, I was, I was making the joke that all lesbians are into thundercats.\n\n01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.040\nLike I was like making up a new stereotype.\n\n01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.040\nAnd literally they are.\n\n01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.040\nI mean, Chitara, give me a break.\n\n01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.040\nYeah.\n\n01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.040\nNo, I mean, that's my, well, I just, you know what?\n\n01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:05.040\nI also have to tell you guys, I just saw Batman vs Superman, but also don't see it.\n\n01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.040\nLike I just saw it a second ago.\n\n01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.040\nSpiders don't see it.\n\n01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:15.040\nBut I wanted to see it with a group of friends and then the theater was very full, you know,\n\n01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.040\nbecause it's the opening weekend or whatever, and Wonder Woman.\n\n01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.040\nYeah.\n\n01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:25.040\nShe's in this movie for like two and a half minutes, but I mean, how do we snarf?\n\n01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.040\nWe go see Wonder Woman.\n\n01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.040\nI'm serious.\n\n01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:33.040\nLike Rita, like she, she, I mean, and this is, I'm just going to go ahead and spoil this.\n\n01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:39.040\nLike you do see her go like, when she appears, she's like, I mean, I stood up and it was\n\n01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.040\nat the arc lights.\n\n01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.040\nSo that was a real problem.\n\n01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.040\nThere she is.\n\n01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.040\nYou know, and then everyone was like,\n\n01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:51.040\nDoes she look like, does she look like sexy Linda Carter, like 70s, 80s Wonder Woman or?\n\n01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.040\nShe looks like,\n\n01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.040\nI'm asking like, does she have high waisted boy shorts on?\n\n01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.040\nBecause that's, that's my kind of thing.\n\n01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.040\nNo, she's got like a cool superhero outfit on.\n\n01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.040\nIt is definitely very short.\n\n01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.040\nThere's a part where she falls down and then her kind of, her kind of, but not, she's,\n\n01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.040\nshe's fighting so much.\n\n01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.040\nShe doesn't fall down like the bed.\n\n01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.040\nBut she needs a little help.\n\n01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.040\nShe kind of slides under like a mechanic, you know, like it's.\n\n01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.040\nShe slides under the glass ceiling.\n\n01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.040\nShe slides under the glass ceiling.\n\n01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.040\nWhich is there for her safety.\n\n01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.040\nI know.\n\n01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.040\nNo, it is, it is.\n\n01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:31.040\nContrary to all this chatter I'm seeing on the internet, it's for safety.\n\n01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040\nThat, the whole.\n\n01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.040\nIt's like a sneeze guard to the glass ceiling.\n\n01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.040\nBut going up.\n\n01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.040\nIt's there for protection.\n\n01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.040\nRight.\n\n01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.040\nIt's, she, this whole movie is about dudes being so sad that they're superheroes.\n\n01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:49.040\nIt's like, it's like two dudes that are like, I'm, like this is, this is actually where we've,\n\n01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:54.040\nthis is the point we've gotten to with, with dude focused movies where now there's just\n\n01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:58.040\nmovies where dudes are like, I don't want any of this.\n\n01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.040\nYou saying the, the fan response you mean?\n\n01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.040\nI don't want it.\n\n01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.040\nNo, like the guys on screen.\n\n01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.040\nYou know them.\n\n01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.040\nTheir names are Batman and Superman.\n\n01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:12.040\nThe whole time they're like, I don't want to do it.\n\n01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.040\nThat's what it looks like in the trailer that they're like, no, that Batman,\n\n01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.040\nyou hear Batman's voice and he's going, why is he so super?\n\n01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.040\nThat's a bad idea.\n\n01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.040\nAnd then Superman's like, it's because I gotta be super.\n\n01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.040\nI don't have a choice.\n\n01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:31.040\nAnd also PS, PS, Ben Affleck and, is it Henry Cavill?\n\n01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.040\nIs that his name?\n\n01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:38.040\nThey are so giant in this movie, like this way.\n\n01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.040\nIt feels like, it feels like the, it's out.\n\n01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.040\nIt feels like they stretched the screen.\n\n01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:47.040\nAnd then they also, they, they're huge this way.\n\n01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:53.040\nAnd then they put, they were like, what will look normal on a man who is,\n\n01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:57.040\neach individual peck is as wide as he is tall.\n\n01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.040\nAnd then, and then somebody was like, oh, for Batman, well,\n\n01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.040\nhe's not wearing the suit, put him in tweed.\n\n01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:10.040\nAnd tweed is like such a bulky fabric that Ben Affleck is like trying to,\n\n01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.040\nwalk, but he's just catching on fire.\n\n01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:17.040\nLike he can't.\n\n01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:20.040\nAnd so he's just staying, he can't, he can't really move.\n\n01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.040\nAnd then they're both, they're so huge.\n\n01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.040\nThey're so huge.\n\n01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:29.040\nAnd then Wonder Woman just, the whole movie is, she's, she's like trying to figure out\n\n01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.040\nif she's going to be Wonder Woman.\n\n01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.040\nI saw, I saw, did you, did you, did you see the trailer before you saw the movie?\n\n01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.040\nI did.\n\n01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.040\nCause I saw, I went to see Deadpool and I saw the, they played the,\n\n01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.040\nOh, you put a sock in it.\n\n01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:45.040\nThe last time this movie came up, I got punched in Miami.\n\n01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.040\nI went to see Deadpool with my girlfriend and they played the trailer before.\n\n01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.040\nI heard all this crazy shit.\n\n01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:55.040\nIt was like, no one's anticipating Batman with, versus Superman or whatever it's called,\n\n01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.040\nwith, with well regard, if that's a phrase.\n\n01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.040\nMaybe I'm drunk.\n\n01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.040\nMaybe I'm dying.\n\n01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:05.040\nThe, but I saw the trailer and I was like, Oh, this, this doesn't look that bad.\n\n01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.040\nAnd I was bummed out and I want to confess why.\n\n01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.040\nBecause I don't like Ben Affleck and I never have it.\n\n01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.040\nI've never wanted to see him win.\n\n01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.040\nYes.\n\n01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.040\nYes.\n\n01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.040\nBut now I feel twice as bad because now he's down.\n\n01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.040\nHave you seen the sad Affleck?\n\n01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.040\nYes.\n\n01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:23.040\nNow I don't even get to hate him with pleasure because now everyone hates him.\n\n01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.040\nI'm like, God damn it.\n\n01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.040\nThat was my idea.\n\n01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:31.340\nWell, I, I have always, I've always found, I liked him when he was like, uh, when he\n\n01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.640\nwas the snot-nosed, like douchebag in movies.\n\n01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.040\nWhen he was the, like, for instance, in Days in Confused.\n\n01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.040\nMwah.\n\n01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.040\nHe's great at everything.\n\n01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.040\nBen, that's it though.\n\n01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.040\nYeah.\n\n01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.040\nThat was the end of it.\n\n01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.040\nYes.\n\n01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.040\nRight.\n\n01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.040\nIn, like, in Days in Confused.\n\n01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.040\nAnd then it ended.\n\n01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.040\nYeah.\n\n01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.040\nIn Days in Confused.\n\n01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.040\nAnd he was just a douchebag.\n\n01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:53.040\nWell, cause like Argo is such an insulting movie, I think, to American audiences and also\n\n01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:57.040\njust to the world because, I don't know if you guys remember when that movie came out,\n\n01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:02.280\nbut the, the end of that movie is that a plane is rolling down the runway and Ben Affleck\n\n01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:08.040\nis like, get in the car and they chase the plane in a car.\n\n01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.040\nAnd I remember seeing, cause it's based on a true story and I remember seeing it and\n\n01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.040\nI was like, well this part didn't happen.\n\n01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.040\nAnd then I went home and I looked it up and it did not.\n\n01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.040\nLike there's no car chase.\n\n01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.960\nI don't even believe that the scene where they, that they must have built the movie around\n\n01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:26.800\nwhere they explained the storyboards to security, I don't believe that happened either.\n\n01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.640\nBecause it's like, oh, is this a Shakespeare in love?\n\n01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.640\nLike what is this?\n\n01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.960\nLike, like, like, to what extent do they fucking care?\n\n01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.320\nIt's just like, when you strip those things out that make the story interesting, it's\n\n01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.320\nlike, well, come on.\n\n01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:41.280\nWell, I feel like when, especially when you're dealing with life and death things and then\n\n01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:44.840\nyou just make it a movie that's like, Argo, fuck yourself.\n\n01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:48.200\nWe made up a phrase that doesn't mean anything.\n\n01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.880\nAnd it's the title of the movie.\n\n01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:57.000\nLike that, that to me, it was so insulting and I have never recovered.\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.720\nI feel like I'm kicking a guy while he's down, but I also feel like I kept my, Ben Affleck\n\n01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:10.720\nis the only person I've ever seen on screen be frustrated by a mentally challenged person.\n\n01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:11.720\nIn what?\n\n01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:12.720\nIn How's Your News.\n\n01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.720\nHave you ever seen that?\n\n01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:17.200\nLike there's a person mentally challenged interviewing him and he's in the, I guess he's\n\n01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:22.160\nwell intended because he's like working at some kind of democratic fundraiser and I think\n\n01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:28.640\nin his head, he's like, why is this person asking me questions about the Daredevil movie?\n\n01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:37.440\nAnd he's like, you can see him unlike every rodeo clown and banker and jailer and homeless\n\n01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.280\nperson that they interview in that movie.\n\n01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:45.840\nEveryone else goes like, you can see them cross the threshold of like, oh, you're different\n\n01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:51.160\nfrom me neurologically and they, and they adjust and it's a very uplifting documentary\n\n01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.520\nthat rides the line between exploitation and fucking like the opposite of it because it's\n\n01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:00.200\nmade by caretakers of, you know, blah, blah, blah, but like, I always, ever since I saw\n\n01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.840\nthat movie, I was like, you're fucking mad at a retarded guy for being retarded.\n\n01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:04.840\nThat's crazy.\n\n01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.200\nThat's so crazy how mad you are at him.\n\n01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.200\nThat's it.\n\n01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:11.080\nWell, and I've always wanted to see him fail.\n\n01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:15.320\nI think that's a great, you know, um, you, when I was.\n\n01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:21.560\nAnd I'm sure this is, I'm sorry, the sad Batman, Ben Affleck, if you're listening.\n\n01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.560\nHe's not listening.\n\n01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.560\nI think he is.\n\n01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.560\nWhat if he is?\n\n01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.560\nBen Affleck.\n\n01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.880\nWhat if this is the one?\n\n01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:34.240\nHe stopped listening during our airplane and he's already ducked out if he was listening.\n\n01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:37.480\nWhat if this, what if this podcast is the one thing he was coming to?\n\n01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480\nI know.\n\n01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.480\nThat would be.\n\n01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.480\nThis is not the thing.\n\n01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.160\nDo you know, I'm sure there's some people here that do you know what, when I was a kid,\n\n01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.800\nthere was an enrichment program that, uh, people did in grade school and it was called\n\n01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.400\nthe voyage of the Mimi and it was, uh, Mimi is great.\n\n01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:59.680\nIt was called the voyage of the Mimi and you had to stay after school and you could watch\n\n01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:05.440\nvideos about like, I think they were shipwrecked children who had to problem solve and Ben\n\n01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:09.160\nAffleck was in this series and he's like 11 years old.\n\n01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:12.160\nUm, so yes, so yes.\n\n01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.160\nYes.\n\n01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:19.640\nNow, yes, so you had to like pass a test and be like a, be like a, like a brain, you\n\n01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.840\nknow, like the, like a sad brainy kid and then you, and then you could stay after school\n\n01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.520\nand you could watch voyage of the Mimi and they solve problems like they solve problems\n\n01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.800\nlike, we don't have any water.\n\n01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.720\nLet's put a tarp out and then the water will collect on the tarp and it will go into a\n\n01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.720\nglass.\n\n01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.720\nYou're describing the Illuminati.\n\n01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:35.720\nYes.\n\n01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:42.400\nCameron, did that build in a love of, uh, Affleck for you or did you, are you, are you predisposed\n\n01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.000\nto like Ben Affleck because of that?\n\n01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.360\nI mean, I think I'm probably not, but I just mean, cause, cause when you were just saying\n\n01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.920\nthat, you know, like days and confuses, this like, you know, young heyday for him, I was\n\n01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:55.400\nlike, this guy's a geezer cause I had been, when he came on the scene though, you're like,\n\n01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.760\nOh, I know this guy since I was like a little girl.\n\n01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.000\nWe came up together.\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:10.160\nI said, made him and met him because Dan and Rob and I met him on, uh, uh, what was the,\n\n01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.840\nthe, the Matt Damon, we met Ben Affleck.\n\n01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.240\nNo, no, where, where, where I, where I first know him is, uh, what's that movie?\n\n01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.240\nGood.\n\n01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.240\nGood about hunting.\n\n01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.880\nThat's, that's where he comes on the scene for me.\n\n01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:26.280\nWell, you've been sleeping cause that shit was around for a while.\n\n01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:35.080\nI hosted the GQ men of the year awards one year when I was on the daily show and by the\n\n01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.320\nway, I just want to tell you, I was hoping you'd bring that up.\n\n01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:45.600\nThat was the only year that, that award really held a really, ever since then it's lost its\n\n01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.600\nmeaning.\n\n01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.600\nThank you.\n\n01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.600\nIt was important.\n\n01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:49.600\nThat was the year.\n\n01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.120\nWho were the men of the year?\n\n01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:55.240\nSo that year, that year, let me answer that question.\n\n01:22:55.240 --> 01:23:02.880\nThat year it was the men of the year ever, ever since then it's been just bullshit.\n\n01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:10.160\nI was doing it for the honor of doing that, not the money, not the loads of money they\n\n01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.000\nwere giving me to do that.\n\n01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.840\nI was doing it cause that was important to me.\n\n01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:19.200\nYou thought that if you hosted man of the year, that it would be a ticket to becoming\n\n01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.320\nman of the year later.\n\n01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:27.040\nSo I went there and it was the first year that there was a bunch of men of the year\n\n01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:35.280\nand the jackass guys were there and then in the table right in front of me was Al Gore,\n\n01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:42.920\nLeonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck and behind Ben Affleck, holding him, Jennifer Garner.\n\n01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.440\nHolding him from behind.\n\n01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.320\nWell, please don't tell me anything negative about Jennifer Garner.\n\n01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.880\nNo, she was great.\n\n01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:51.200\nShe comes out, the hero in this story.\n\n01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.560\nShe's the hero in this story.\n\n01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.560\nShe looks so good in the wings.\n\n01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.920\nOh, she's the best.\n\n01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.360\nShe comes out the hero.\n\n01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:02.760\nSo I wrote this whole comedy bit with a friend of mine and he was in the way back of the\n\n01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:06.200\nroom with my wife and it was really funny.\n\n01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.480\nI thought it was very, very funny.\n\n01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:14.480\nAnd one of my, then I started, it was like a light roast of all the people there.\n\n01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.480\nThat's good, right?\n\n01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:22.200\nGood to see Leonardo DiCaprio's here.\n\n01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.200\nHe tips 19%.\n\n01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.200\nYeah.\n\n01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.200\nThat's exactly what I like.\n\n01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.720\nIt's still way above what you should expect.\n\n01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:33.680\nSo I started with, so I see the jackass guys are here and Steve Oh said, sit down, you\n\n01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.840\nshit ass.\n\n01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:41.320\nSo that was my first experience interacting with the audience.\n\n01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.000\nSo that was immediately like out of my element.\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.320\nThat's not even a term.\n\n01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.360\nHe said, sit down, you shit ass.\n\n01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:53.360\nI've met Steve Oh, the first time I met him, he took, he pulled up his shirt.\n\n01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.600\nHe's got a tattoo of himself.\n\n01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600\nHimself.\n\n01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.600\nYeah.\n\n01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.960\nAnd this was like full on drug years, Steve Oh, and he was, he's all sobered up now.\n\n01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:04.520\nNow it's the constitution.\n\n01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.520\nYeah.\n\n01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.520\nYeah.\n\n01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.520\nHe's become a libertarian.\n\n01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:13.920\nI feel like I'd be able to connect with Steve Oh now that he's sober and on his back, now\n\n01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:17.400\na map to dry land and that's controversial, but it's true.\n\n01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:21.840\nSo I said, he's just starting to get tattoos of other people now.\n\n01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:31.200\nI worked my way up to Ben Affleck and I said, Ben Affleck is here and Jen Garter was behind\n\n01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:36.960\nBen Affleck and she just started shaking her head at me and he was staring at me like\n\n01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:42.720\nstaring daggers at me and Jen Garter is going, don't, don't do it.\n\n01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.440\nYou're causing me six hours of paperwork.\n\n01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:50.200\nHe's like, you love any respect for me.\n\n01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.080\nYou will not ruin my weekend.\n\n01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.480\nYou will not like these apples.\n\n01:25:54.480 --> 01:26:02.280\nI had a bunch of jokes prepared.\n\n01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:07.160\nThis guy is an emotional China syndrome.\n\n01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.800\nDon't do it for him and do it for me.\n\n01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:18.320\nSo I said, Ben Affleck is here, Ben Affleck and I, the whole front row is in the fetal\n\n01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.920\nposition, Ben Affleck is here.\n\n01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.600\nWe, Ben and I have a lot in common.\n\n01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:33.800\nWe're both from Boston, Ben, Ben, we, we both drive Maserati's except for me.\n\n01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.680\nThat I thought was a really good joke.\n\n01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.160\nThat's fine.\n\n01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.440\nAnd then, and I said, this was terrible joke.\n\n01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:47.080\nI said, and when something like in the moment of climax, we both caught, we have both called\n\n01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:52.560\nout J Lo's name.\n\n01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.040\nSomething like that.\n\n01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.520\nJust like a general proximity.\n\n01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.520\nGarner's head.\n\n01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.520\nShe's like, whipping herself.\n\n01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.320\nShe's like, I was protecting him.\n\n01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.320\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.680\nGiving herself whiplash saying no.\n\n01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:15.520\nAnd, and then they excused me from the stage and Al Gore got up and he said, this is just\n\n01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.800\nlike Jimmy Carran's story.\n\n01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.000\nWhat the fuck happened right then and there?\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.440\nWhat do you mean they excused you from the stage?\n\n01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.440\nNo, this is what happened.\n\n01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.440\nAnd we never got a straight answer for it.\n\n01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.840\nThis is what happened.\n\n01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:30.840\nWill Ferrell was there and he's the only one laughing at every one of my jokes.\n\n01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:41.960\nHe's the only one laughing at full volume and I didn't, I've, I've since, I don't know\n\n01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:46.120\nwhether he was laughing because he thought it was funny or he laughing because he felt\n\n01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.920\nbad for me.\n\n01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:57.000\nAnd then I left the stage and Al Gore got up and Al Gore said, well, we've all suffered\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.760\nRob Corddry's barbs.\n\n01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.760\nWhat?\n\n01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.000\nNo, Rob Corddry.\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.400\nHe called me Rob Corddry.\n\n01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.160\nRob Corddry's barbs.\n\n01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.160\nAnd that's when I yell.\n\n01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.640\nI like whispered to my wife in the back of the room, I said, start the car.\n\n01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:16.800\nAnd then I got back up and I thanked everybody for being there.\n\n01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.320\nAnd Steve O yelled at me again.\n\n01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.840\nAnd then I walked off the stage and got right into my, just walked right into my car.\n\n01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:24.840\nI went home.\n\n01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:31.960\nI'm sorry, Rob, is it because, uh, because he's so sacred, like what was the point?\n\n01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:32.960\nIs it Ben Affleck?\n\n01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.960\nYeah.\n\n01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:34.960\nYeah.\n\n01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:35.960\nI guess, I guess that's the point.\n\n01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:36.960\nThat you are not allowed to make fun of Ben Affleck.\n\n01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:37.960\nI guess I was not allowed.\n\n01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:38.960\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:44.920\nI made some, I made some Leonardo DiCaprio jokes and there was nobody behind Leo going\n\n01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:45.920\nno, no.\n\n01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.040\nNo, it was Jennifer Garner was holding him from behind and she was like, she was like,\n\n01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:54.760\nshe was like, I know my boyfriend, husband, whatever he was to her, uh, my, my, my, my\n\n01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.760\nward.\n\n01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:01.040\nUh, I know what's coming and I know I've dealt with this.\n\n01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:05.440\nI was at a cerebral palsy benefit and someone made a joke that he didn't understand and\n\n01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:11.400\nit's been three days of, of fucking bringing him toasted cheese sandwiches and telling him\n\n01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:12.400\nit'll be better.\n\n01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:17.760\nDon't fucking roast this guy if you care about Jennifer Garner's week.\n\n01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.760\nThat's what was happening.\n\n01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.120\nAnd then, and then his joke accidentally was like, it was like on her and she's like, I\n\n01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.120\ndon't believe it.\n\n01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:31.040\nI really think in general roasting worst, worst job of, for people you don't have a relationship\n\n01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.040\nwith.\n\n01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040\nNo.\n\n01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.040\nWhy?\n\n01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.040\nAnd who hates me?\n\n01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.600\nAnd why they do this to comics?\n\n01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.000\nI will never understand.\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.120\nLike what I mean is we've, and if everybody's buddies or let's say it's Donald Trump and\n\n01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:47.440\nhe's like, I am benefiting enormously from being on comedy central and everybody is\n\n01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.360\ngoing to make fun of me and I have signed up for this fully.\n\n01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:54.680\nBut other than that, I feel like it's just like you're either Tina and Amy or don't\n\n01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.680\ndo it.\n\n01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:56.680\nDon't do it.\n\n01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.680\nYeah.\n\n01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.680\nThe answer is don't do it.\n\n01:29:58.680 --> 01:29:59.680\nDon't do it.\n\n01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:00.680\nDon't do it.\n\n01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:01.680\nThese are strangers.\n\n01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:02.680\nI made $35,000.\n\n01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:03.680\nHey.\n\n01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:05.680\nDo it.\n\n01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:06.680\nDo it.\n\n01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:07.680\nDo it.\n\n01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:13.360\nAt a time when that was, that was, I was super cool with that.\n\n01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:17.680\nDo you think you, do you, do you think you killed print media?\n\n01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:21.680\nThat might have been the night that it died.\n\n01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.680\nYes.\n\n01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.680\nYeah.\n\n01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:24.680\nThat might have been the night.\n\n01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680\nYou were like, let's save this magazine.\n\n01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.680\nWho can we get on our side?\n\n01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.680\nAl Gore and Ben Affleck.\n\n01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.680\nSit down you shit-ass.\n\n01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:38.680\nBut don't just, don't just think it's Jennifer Garner was like holding him back because\n\n01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:40.680\nshe thinks like, oh, he's going to kick your ass.\n\n01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:41.680\nNo, no.\n\n01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:47.400\nI did a movie with Jennifer Garner right after that and I was like, fuck, do I talk to her\n\n01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.400\nabout this?\n\n01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.520\nDo I talk to her about this moment that we shared because we shared a moment and she has\n\n01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:58.680\nto know about this moment and we didn't spend one second on it.\n\n01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:01.680\nWe didn't talk about it.\n\n01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.680\nWait, what year was this?\n\n01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:05.680\nOh, eight or five, six years ago.\n\n01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:06.680\nI don't mean to, I do not mean to.\n\n01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:07.680\nThe movie was Butter.\n\n01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:08.680\nIt was called Butter.\n\n01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.680\nOh yeah.\n\n01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.200\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:16.360\nI do not, I do not mean to diminish your role in your life, but I wonder if maybe she\n\n01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.360\njust didn't remember.\n\n01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.360\nDidn't give a shit.\n\n01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:21.360\nWell, I think maybe she just didn't give a shit also, I bet like she had a lot of stuff\n\n01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.360\ngoing on.\n\n01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:23.360\nI think she was kind of busy.\n\n01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.360\nYeah.\n\n01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.360\nShe had a lot of things.\n\n01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:29.040\nAnd then I have like that hard, that worried, you're right.\n\n01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.040\nI know it's going to.\n\n01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.840\nI probably did not register on her.\n\n01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:35.640\nIt's going to seem like we set this up, but what I wanted, I wanted the three of you to\n\n01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:38.400\ndo, I brought the scripts.\n\n01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:42.360\nI wanted the three of you to do the controversial scene from Butter.\n\n01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.360\nOh shit.\n\n01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.360\nOh shit.\n\n01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.360\nThe fair, the Butter fair scene?\n\n01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:49.360\nThe director's cut, the director cut.\n\n01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.360\nOkay.\n\n01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.360\nOkay, so.\n\n01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.360\nGuys.\n\n01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.360\nThe campfire scene.\n\n01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.840\nI finally finished it.\n\n01:31:54.840 --> 01:32:00.840\nThis is my sculpture of a monopoly board made out of butter.\n\n01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:11.680\nListen, it's pretty hot out and it's bread.\n\n01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.040\nTime to get some bread in here.\n\n01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:21.400\nI was going to say then bread fell from the sky.\n\n01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:31.560\nYeah, and this is where you set this whole thing up.\n\n01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:34.400\nThat's thunder.\n\n01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:40.120\nYou brought me here to an outside butter tournament to set up this monopoly board just to drop\n\n01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:47.160\nbread from the ceiling in the middle of a thunderstorm typical romance.\n\n01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.760\nI don't know why they cut the scene.\n\n01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.760\nI don't.\n\n01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.880\nThat seems like a great scene.\n\n01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.760\nThey cut that for time or what?\n\n01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.760\nI guess it was.\n\n01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:55.760\nYeah.\n\n01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.760\nThe World Trade Center was in the background.\n\n01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.880\nYeah, it happened.\n\n01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:01.880\nFor no reason.\n\n01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.880\nThis movie came out around 9-11.\n\n01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:10.200\nCameron, have you ever been hired or asked to roast other people?\n\n01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:12.880\nNot for 35 Gs.\n\n01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:19.080\nNo, I'm kind of smiley.\n\n01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.080\nSo I think people don't think I can do it.\n\n01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.080\nThose people are wrong.\n\n01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:23.080\nI'm so mean.\n\n01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.080\nGuys, let's roast each other.\n\n01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:26.080\nAll right.\n\n01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:27.080\nOh, shit.\n\n01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:28.080\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the Harmontown.\n\n01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.080\nI don't like this.\n\n01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.080\nRoast.\n\n01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.080\nI don't like this.\n\n01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.080\nI don't like this.\n\n01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.080\nThe Roastware.\n\n01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:45.080\nSuspenser is the Roastmaster General over here.\n\n01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.000\nWhat is a Roastmaster General?\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nRoastmaster General means you get to run the proceedings.\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nAll right.\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nGo.\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000\nDo you want to say who roasts whom?\n\n01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nNo.\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nAll right.\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nDo you want to be the Roastmaster General?\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nNo, we haven't spoken to you for a while.\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nYou've been sitting over there.\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000\nNo, it's all good.\n\n01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.000\nI don't have very much input on movies or comedy routines or famous people or experiences.\n\n01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000\nWith them, I just, you know, it's all good.\n\n01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nI just, if I had things to contribute, you know what?\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000\nAll right.\n\n01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nAll right.\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nLet's talk about Isis.\n\n01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nThere's only one thing you roast out.\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000\nWell, we've been really pulling together a new plot that I think is going to just surprise\n\n01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000\neverybody.\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000\nYou're an Isis?\n\n01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000\nNo.\n\n01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nDole?\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000\nSubscribe to Harmontown.com.\n\n01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nLive to see my dough face.\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000\nI can roast you guys.\n\n01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000\nI can roast you guys so much.\n\n01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000\nAll right.\n\n01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000\nWe need a Roastmaster General that's going to bring people.\n\n01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000\nYou would be burned up.\n\n01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000\nNo, I want to be burned up.\n\n01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000\nBut when I'm going to roast you, you're going to get hot.\n\n01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nGet it.\n\n01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000\nYou're going to get so crispy, your skin is going to get blistered.\n\n01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000\nHey, Esposito, save your roasts for when the roast starts.\n\n01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nLane, Lane.\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nI'm a scratch talking in advance.\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000\nOh, you boys are not even going to know.\n\n01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nWhen I start to talk, you are going to listen to me.\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000\nAll right, everybody.\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000\nWelcome to the first annual Harmontown Roast.\n\n01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000\nWhere nobody's safe from being roasted at any moment.\n\n01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000\nThe Roaster can become the Roaster.\n\n01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nWait, wait.\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nIs Jimmy Carran still here?\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000\nLet's sit.\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nI'm on the record.\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000\nIn a shorter chair.\n\n01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nIs Jimmy Carran still here?\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000\nYeah, in the center of the stage unless roast Jimmy Carran.\n\n01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000\nBut I know it.\n\n01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000\nYou're just trying to get out of being roasted.\n\n01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nRoaster.\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000\nOh, no, you can roast me.\n\n01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nI just thought it'd be funny if it was the third party because it's how roasts work.\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nLet's bring out Jimmy Carran again to possibly get roasted.\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000\nLet's put it.\n\n01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000\nOkay.\n\n01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nYeah, you were doing great.\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nYou were doing great.\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nOkay.\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000\nThere we go.\n\n01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nOkay.\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000\nOkay.\n\n01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000\nGo ahead, Jeff.\n\n01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000\nJeff, it's the Jimmy Carran roast.\n\n01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000\nAll right, Jimmy Carran.\n\n01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nHello.\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nI'm Jeff Davis here.\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000\nYour host.\n\n01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nWe got Jimmy Carran out here.\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nHe told a story about trying to commit suicide on a plane earlier.\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000\nYou know, a lot of people would be Guantanamo for that.\n\n01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000\nBut I like Jimmy Carran.\n\n01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000\nHere's somebody who hates Jimmy Carran.\n\n01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.000\nCameron Esposito, everybody.\n\n01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000\nOh, Jimmy Carran.\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nI've known you for years because we both spent time in Chicago.\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nWhat a city.\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nIt is full of food and you will eat it if you are hungry.\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000\nJust like everyone else.\n\n01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000\nYou are so good at improv that you teach classes and you make people pay you.\n\n01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nYou very greedy man.\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000\nCameron Esposito, everybody.\n\n01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nCameron Esposito.\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000\nYou like these balls?\n\n01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nHis name is Rob.\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000\nHis name is Dan Harmon.\n\n01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:28.000\nI would have come here earlier, but Roseanne Barr's pussy had that horn in it.\n\n01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000\nGood job, Cameron Esposito.\n\n01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:40.000\nHey, your lesbian called the 90s once the back wants to get the lesbianism back.\n\n01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nNo, she's going, I kid Cameron Esposito.\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nI kid her because I'm opposed to her lifestyle.\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:10.000\nI'm not going to say Cameron Esposito is a lesbian, but when she goes out, she goes out with a woman.\n\n01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:26.000\nWe are here to talk about the legend Jimmy Corraine, the man, the legend, the fucking horrible monster.\n\n01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nFolks, it's not fair.\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nI know a lot of people say Jimmy Corraine is a piece of shit.\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nHe's a terrible person.\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000\nHe should kill himself.\n\n01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000\nWhat else is going on?\n\n01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nDan Harmon, everybody.\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nLet's bring out him.\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nYou know how to be hurt.\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nYou know him, you love him.\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nHe's the less famous Cordray.\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nRob Corddry.\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000\nOh, man.\n\n01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000\nAmy Schumer is not here.\n\n01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nBut she's a slut, right?\n\n01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000\nAnd then there's the other guys, the roastmaster general.\n\n01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nHe's fat.\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000\nAnd then there's all the guys that Dan mentioned.\n\n01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000\nAnd then Cameron's a lesbian.\n\n01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000\nAnd then Trubb is bald as fuck.\n\n01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nHe doesn't even know he's been bald since he was 19.\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nIt's like, uh, fuck.\n\n01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nAnd then, but then there's the guy, Jimmy.\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:58.000\nI really respect him because he's a guy that is sort of a luminary in the improv community.\n\n01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000\nThat was Rob Corddry, everybody.\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000\nDamn, damn.\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nI really need a rebuttal because I didn't realize\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000\nI was supposed to cover everyone.\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000\nHang on, hang on.\n\n01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000\nHang on.\n\n01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:47.000\nI'm not saying Cameron Esposito doesn't understand roasts, but when she goes to TGI Fridays,\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:54.000\nshe orders the... You know what's better than this? Let's bring out Rob Schrab, everybody! Rob Schrab!\n\n01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:12.000\nI'm so sad all the time. Oh God, I stepped on a nail. My foot hurts. It hurts so bad.\n\n01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nOh, it's... Y'all seem like really nice people. I don't understand the point of this. Oh, it's bleeding really bad right now.\n\n01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:33.000\nThis nail, I stepped on a nail. I didn't see it was really dark backstage. It went right through my shoe.\n\n01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:43.000\nRob, Rob, Rob! Rob, Rob! It really hurts! I had to walk on it just to get the podium so far away from the edge of the stage.\n\n01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000\nRob, are you supposed to make friend of Cameron? Or Jimmy or anybody else?\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000\nYou could be taller, I guess.\n\n01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000\nI just, I just...\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000\nI...\n\n01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000\nI...\n\n01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000\nSeriously, I...\n\n01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000\nYou're not supposed to pull it out.\n\n01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000\nI heard you're not supposed to pull it out.\n\n01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000\nIt makes it bleed.\n\n01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000\nBro, work the dais. Work the dais right there.\n\n01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000\nOh, my God.\n\n01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000\nI'm losing a lot of blood here.\n\n01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nOh, Cordray.\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000\nA nice, nice shirt, I guess.\n\n01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000\nIt could be...\n\n01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000\nIt actually is a nice shirt.\n\n01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000\nIt is. It's a bunch going on.\n\n01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000\nYeah, it's great. Okay.\n\n01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000\nDan, you smell like piss, and...\n\n01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000\nShit.\n\n01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000\nOh, my God.\n\n01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000\nThis nail in my foot really hurt.\n\n01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000\nIt might be one of those, like,\n\n01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000\ndrywall screws between...\n\n01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000\nOh, my God.\n\n01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000\nCall my wife.\n\n01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000\nCall my wife.\n\n01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000\nPlease call my wife.\n\n01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000\nLet's hear it.\n\n01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000\nSomebody help me walk off stage.\n\n01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000\nSomebody help me walk off stage.\n\n01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000\nIt's only going to make it worse walking on stage.\n\n01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000\nAgainst normal roast protocol\n\n01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000\nfor an early rebuttal, Cameron Esposito,\n\n01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000\neven though it's not her roast.\n\n01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000\nYes, exactly.\n\n01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000\nWow, the whole team now.\n\n01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000\nYou're lined up\n\n01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000\nand get ready for these things.\n\n01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000\nSpencer Crittenden, everybody.\n\n01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000\nSpencer Crittenden.\n\n01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000\nSpencer Crittenden. No hard feelings.\n\n01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000\nNo hard feelings.\n\n01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000\nWait, where is he going?\n\n01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000\nSit the fuck down.\n\n01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000\nHe really liked the joke.\n\n01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000\nI will say when the roast is over.\n\n01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000\nHe loves the roast.\n\n01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000\nI want a second rebuttal.\n\n01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000\nSecond rebuttal.\n\n01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000\nCameron Esposito, back for rebuttal number two, everybody.\n\n01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000\nI should get a tourniquet or something.\n\n01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000\nSomebody turn his laugh mic off.\n\n01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000\nMy toes are turning purple.\n\n01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000\nMy toes are turning purple.\n\n01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000\nDan, I'm not saying\n\n01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000\nthat you didn't make Malcolm in the middle.\n\n01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000\nBut you made a whole other show\n\n01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000\nthat was equally beloved.\n\n01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000\nBut by a different group of people\n\n01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000\nthan that other show,\n\n01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000\nthe two shows are for a different audience.\n\n01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000\nAnd I think you are being too competitive.\n\n01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000\nSo I don't think you need to worry about it.\n\n01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000\nAnd it seems like you still have enough money\n\n01:44:43.000 -->
