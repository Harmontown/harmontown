00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
From Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Let's bring out some major critics in, shall we?

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
There's me, boy.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
Thank you very much.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Oh, all right.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
It's a good song.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Yeah.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
I mean, you know, he's outnumbered in hating me.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
You know, people like me.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
And they like working with me.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Happy Easter, thank you for coming on a holiday.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
You got little scratchy throat?

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Yeah, that's why I'm excited that we have, like, a gigantic abundance of guests tonight.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Do we have too much, too much show?

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I think it's perfectly balancing.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
I've been, I just, it's all, like, it's meetings all week.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
And, like, I'm just, I'm always talking.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
My job is always talking.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Like, I'm not, I never get to, like, go, okay, good meeting, guys.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
And then just start, like, operating a jackhammer.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And just thinking about, that meeting was crazy.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
My whole life is just meetings and talking now.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Talking about writing, like, rarely writing.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
And even when, and even when I am writing, I'm talking about what I'm writing,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
because I'm writing with other people, and I'm going, like,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
well, this should be written like this.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Well, I think it should be written like this.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Well, you're a piece of shit!

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Sorry.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
And then, and then all weekends, I'm shooting this history thing, Great Minds.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
And we worked with Nick Kroll today, and it was amazing.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
I just watched the Thomas Middle, the Shakespeare thing.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
I was so happy you guys shot it at the Tin Horn Flats.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
It's a great little bar.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah, very funny.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah, we've been very, I mean, we have, it's called Great Minds,

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
and we have, it's been like a real, like, squad goals, kind of, like, just convention for me.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Everybody that I've ever wanted to, like, just meet or work with is, like, coming through.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Yesterday was Kristen Schaal as Amelia Earhart.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
She's, she's, like, regardless of on screen, like, Kristen Schaal is, like,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
and I asked around after she left the set, and I almost wanted to ask her,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
but I'm kind of a stranger to her, so I thought it would be a weird question.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
I wanted to ask, are you in a really good mood today?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Or are you, are you always like this?

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
It's just like, like, a totally chill, delightful person.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
And then Schrab had worked with her, and was like, yeah, no, she's exactly like that all the time.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
I was having a sandwich at a place today, and the, the, the...

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Jeff, how can you pretend that's related?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
That's just what Jeff does. He always forces...

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
The bartender, the waiter...

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm name-dropping, and you're always forcing your ordinary world experiences.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
The waiter walked up, the waiter walked up to the bartender and said,

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
that girl from Flight of the Concords, that girl from Flight of the Concords,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
and I knew who they meant, said, like, she came in today,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
and she was the coolest person in the world.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
She was just sprinkling stardust around our neighborhood all day long.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I'm telling you, I don't want to...

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Tell her I spread my fucking common day bullshit around.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
I don't want to cause trouble for her and her personal life,

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
but like, by making people go, oh, I'm going to seek her out and stalk her.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
I just, like, she is truly, she's like a human air freshener.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
I have walked onto planes where I've overheard flight attendants say,

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Kristen Schaal was on the plane earlier, and she was like, made everybody so happy.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
We flew 500 feet higher, and used less gas.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
We got there so early that there was no gate for us to land at.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
They had to build it.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yes.

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
We arrived at the Us Memorial Airport, found out we had died of happiness in the past,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
which was the present.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Dan Spencer, like, people, if you work in the industry long enough,

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
you'll meet people and you'll hear good stories about people, bad stories,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
or certain people that people have negative things to say about, positive things.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
Nobody so far has ever said anything negative about Kristen Schaal, as far as I've ever heard.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
There's a bunch of, you know, I mean, I wouldn't want, that's not as rare a thing.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
It's like, there's, there's menches in the world, like, like Will Ferrell and, I mean,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Nick Kroll, who we worked with today, like, like, like, I don't, I don't,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I never heard of Nick Kroll's a dick story.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
That guy is like a, I told him today, because I was like, thank you so much for doing the show.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Like, like, he just came in and I don't want to say took over in a, that makes,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
that makes, makes it sound like he was telling people what to do.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
He just, it was just easier to just let him go.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
He was like a pull string doll that you pull and he just, like, acts all over the place.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
It's amazing.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
I told him, I said, not, not that it was a competition, but I said, I said,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Nick Kroll, you are like a tornado that builds houses.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Because he made a, she made our TV show for us.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
Yeah, it was crazy. We just let ours be torn down and, like, there was a better one erected as he,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
as he wished through.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
It was, it was amazing.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
We're gonna have those guys.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Whatever, whatever, famous people are great.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
No, they're not great.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
The point is, you've been lucky.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
The point is that you're getting to work with the coolest people in the world.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
There are dicks.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
There's like, there's Rob Corddry, is it, you know, is it?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
That guy.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I'm so glad I wasn't here for that show.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
He sounded like, he sounded like such a tool.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I know, I fucking bit my lip.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Because it's like, you're such a dick.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
You issued a lot of restraint.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I thought that was very good of you.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
I know, what were you gonna do?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I have an application to the crowd.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I want to put on a good show, so I don't want them to feel the tension, but it's like...

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Rob Schrab, too, I mean, come on.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah, no, these guys are racists.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Sexists.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Do you think there's any corollary to there being named Rob and being bald at the same time

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
that makes them the same version of bad people?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I don't know.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Well, I don't have anything.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
I mean, yeah, well, we have a lot of guests, so why don't we start bringing them out.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
Please welcome Fresh Off of their two-man show, a tour off Broadway.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Rob's Schrab and Cordray, right here.

06:30.000 --> 06:50.000
Rob Schrab, Rob and Cordray.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
We already have too much show.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
This is already more of a show.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I was gonna give you the pole position here.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
You've earned it.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
No.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I sat across them from...

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Rob Corddry?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I don't feel like I deserve this.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Rob Corddry, may I address you, please?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Go ahead.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I was at a town last show.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
I listened to it and made me so happy that you are such a big fan of the show.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You love your Dave Kline's.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
You were sad and it totally wasn't here.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I was.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Is he here?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Fuck!

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I think he's moved on.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
He's blowing it.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
The turnover rate is high, you know?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Really?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Dave Kline will stop youping pretty soon.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Adam Goldberg's probably not here.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Nope.

07:33.000 --> 07:40.000
We're catching these kids in a turbulent time of their life.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
There's no Charles Grotin's in the audience.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
They're just like, I love your show.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I'm gonna be here for 35 years.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
But Jeff, I was really upset that you weren't here.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
I mean, Trump was a great control.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I did pretty good.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
He's a great comp, especially when his parents are here.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Oh, yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Because he's the least Schrabby.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
That episode with David?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Who's your dad's name?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
David.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Dave.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Dave.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Dave.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Dave and Donna, right?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
David and Donna.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Yes.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
The episode with your parents on was really magical.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I thought that was really magical.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Well, because that's what controls him.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
Bringing Schrab's parents on stage is like picking up a feral cat by the scruff of the neck.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
Schrab just went limp.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
He was just shaking his head the whole time at you.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Be careful.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Be careful.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
So you guys, you know, I mean...

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah, man.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
It's great that...

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yeah.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, man.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Lay it on us.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Lay it on us.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Lay it on.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Full on Schrab.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Give it to us, man.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Lay it.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
You're getting the double Schrab right now.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah, man.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Oh, shit.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah, man.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Lay it on us.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Oh, shit.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Oh, shit.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh, shit.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Oh, shit.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Oh, shit.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Oh, shit.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh, shit.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Oh, shit.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Give me a red cup.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Oh, shit.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Give it to me.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Give me a red cup.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Oh, shit.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000

Immediately and then and then there's a whole scene. There's a whole you have a whole kitchen. Oh, yeah, you play the yeah

11:08.600 --> 11:10.720
Yeah, yeah, Dan will play the kitchen staff

11:10.720 --> 11:16.200
Yeah, to be or to see where we're not okay with it. Well, it's a it's a hard to explain

11:16.200 --> 11:22.920
Yeah, yeah, it's a two-man show, but there's actually nine to ten nine to ten people right that help us out

11:22.920 --> 11:29.680
And like six six of them are attractive young women that yes hip-hop interstitials all dressed in black, right?

11:30.120 --> 11:33.760
Yeah, so you're in the kitchen now. He wants a plate

11:34.320 --> 11:36.880
You can have it a plate if you don't have pain

11:36.880 --> 11:40.000
Hey, you haven't seen the show

11:42.800 --> 11:44.800
But whatever

11:45.600 --> 11:47.600
We'll just

11:48.400 --> 11:52.400
The third yeah, we'll deal with the plate. You have me the plate. You fucked it up. You fucked it up on purpose

11:52.680 --> 11:55.440
All right, we'll skip to the third. Okay. Okay, great. Oh

11:56.200 --> 11:59.840
Oh, okay, this is a plate because my hand is straight Rob

12:00.600 --> 12:06.080
Thank you so much for this plate that you gave me take it. I'm trying to take it

12:06.080 --> 12:13.360
I'm trying but my take it. I'm gonna drop my hand. Okay. Okay. You have to take one of the plate two

12:14.040 --> 12:16.040
three

12:16.840 --> 12:22.280
And then and the plate was stuck to my hand. Yeah, it's stuck to his hand and

12:23.120 --> 12:25.120
and it's

12:25.440 --> 12:28.120
This show has run for five years. Yeah

12:28.880 --> 12:30.880
Off off off Broadway

12:30.880 --> 12:37.760
It's presented as if that's a magic trick when I saw the show and I did see it right and in my defense Tim Conway

12:37.760 --> 12:42.360
Was playing the part I was doing right. He was the understudy. Yeah, so maybe I laid it on too thick for you

12:42.360 --> 12:48.960
But yeah, it's not a good show the the thing is that you present the plate stuck to the hand as if it's like a

12:49.240 --> 12:54.600
Magical thing, but yeah, that scene comes after 20 minutes of those six girls dancing, right?

12:55.120 --> 12:59.680
It's plenty of time to glue a plate to your hand. Yeah, but but as you but we

12:59.680 --> 13:07.560
But we didn't use any glue. No. Yeah, it's it's actually it's enough time to make a special plate with a hand strap on it

13:07.960 --> 13:13.520
But we didn't do that. We have a whole thing. Well, like we don't we're not miming spaghetti

13:13.520 --> 13:17.080
It's like we're doing now. We're using real spagetti

13:17.080 --> 13:23.600
It's enough time enough time passes that we did but Dan we didn't do that. Yeah, we didn't do that

13:23.600 --> 13:28.480
You don't give it a strap. We didn't use a glue. We just had a plate and it was stuck on my hand

13:28.480 --> 13:33.120
We didn't do anything. Why don't you just come see the show man? I saw it

13:33.920 --> 13:39.560
Again, why don't you come see the show again? Why did you see it right? You got to see it

13:39.840 --> 13:43.240
You see it all see the show through the better eyes

13:44.160 --> 13:50.600
Then you've seen it. We didn't you don't understand it was a real trick. Yeah, by the way the night I came to the show

13:50.600 --> 13:52.600
They were doing this to strangers in the lobby

13:52.600 --> 13:58.600
Well, hey, it's been running for five years like the blue man group in a way

13:58.600 --> 14:01.160
Yeah, the show starts when you get into the lobby

14:01.680 --> 14:06.960
No, wait, no, it's and there are shows where there's a show a Rob

14:07.400 --> 14:13.240
That's this show is in Vegas. It's it's not even us. It's yeah, we got other guys playing us two guys

14:13.240 --> 14:19.920
They're not even named Rob Austin. Well, I saw the one I saw the one in Phoenix that was Stanley Tucci and David Cross

14:19.920 --> 14:24.840
That's a shit show. No, Rob. Those guys do it all fucked up. We're working on it

14:24.840 --> 14:27.280
Yeah, Rob and Rob like like the blue man group

14:27.280 --> 14:32.480
I heard like that your shows like the blue man group was the ones we see in Vegas. Yeah, York, Chicago

14:32.680 --> 14:36.360
It's a little bit watered down. Yeah, then the original stuff. That's true

14:36.360 --> 14:44.360
I heard you guys had a more hardcore version of your show before you guys started playing big markets. Yeah. Yeah, that's right

14:44.360 --> 14:46.360
Yeah, yeah, you heard that you

14:46.360 --> 14:53.800
I mean who didn't hear that. Yeah, no, that's the review that everybody heard everybody's heard that

14:53.800 --> 14:57.720
Can you guys do the scene rotten tomatoes? Can you loves us? Can you do?

14:58.240 --> 15:02.760
Can you do the scene? I heard it was more hardcore. What scene do you want to see? Well scene?

15:02.760 --> 15:06.240
I think you know, it's the one that the controversial scene

15:06.240 --> 15:10.400
Yes, the scene that the scene that you guys weren't allowed to do it's why you softened up

15:11.400 --> 15:15.280
The reason Buzzfeed and salon came down on you guys. It's really

15:15.280 --> 15:22.160
You're gonna you're gonna because it's out of context. I get it like but you shouldn't but that's why I say it's your choice

15:22.160 --> 15:24.160
If you want to do it

15:24.560 --> 15:27.080
I mean, I guess yeah, we won't we can now

15:29.560 --> 15:31.560
No, I guess we want it's really racist

15:33.440 --> 15:38.160
Hey, why why Dan why stage picture stage picture

15:38.160 --> 15:44.800

But I looked at them for the first time through new eyes, sorry Dan

21:05.040 --> 21:09.600
It'll it'll it'll be hard for the audience to listen constantly while Schrab is making a

21:11.320 --> 21:13.320
Pantom I'm drink

21:13.320 --> 21:18.320
I'll just take the cup and scoop it you could just scoop

21:24.960 --> 21:26.960
Didn't trim my oh

21:27.800 --> 21:30.960
What's the whole yeah, listen I listened to that episode

21:31.760 --> 21:39.640
Most of that episode today about the trimming and the washing and I'm really interested in did you agree that I was being bullied? Oh

21:39.640 --> 21:41.640
Oh

21:41.680 --> 21:48.840
No, I don't know I think you maybe have it might have but I was I felt like in my car listening

21:48.840 --> 21:54.560
I was being a little bullied too. So maybe that's what you were doing you want to talk about your your pube

21:54.560 --> 21:59.720
Yeah, I would like to how I would grab Cordray. How are you being pube bullied?

22:00.680 --> 22:08.320
Hashtag I felt like I related to Dan in that I don't pay much attention to that and I have a lot of attention

22:08.320 --> 22:10.760
I'm I gotta pay attention. I'm married

22:12.760 --> 22:17.920
Who tells me that it's not a big thing hmm that's code for it is a big thing

22:19.080 --> 22:24.480
But it's a huge thing, but I think that we're not a big thing that you keep the but I don't see it

22:24.480 --> 22:30.280
But I do think and this is not me bullying you. This is me like going to you like an AA going like hey, man

22:30.280 --> 22:36.040
I know that look like if we waited for them to ask like we're not good people right right

22:36.040 --> 22:40.480
We should just do it thinking about it. I've done it. Sometimes I did it. I've done it at times

22:40.480 --> 22:44.080
I did it when I was like 12 because I started coming in. I'm like get him out of here. Oh

22:44.840 --> 22:47.640
No, I shaved my legs. I was like fuck me

22:49.640 --> 22:54.840
Pushing the hair up my legs so that it would look like I had more hair on my legs

22:55.320 --> 23:02.000
Because I had masculinity. I looked I looked at my pubes for the for through these eyes after that episode not too shabby

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
You know it's like

23:04.240 --> 23:11.120
Not too shabby. It's not too. It's not too Schrabby. It's it's like it's it's it's okay. You might not have an issue

23:11.120 --> 23:13.720

28:43.240 --> 28:45.800
light coming through one of the the

28:46.360 --> 28:49.560
There's a shade that's got about two inches and all of a sudden you go wait

28:49.560 --> 28:54.240
Wait before we start and you get up and you pull the shade down to make it completely dark

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Now what is that about?

28:57.000 --> 29:04.040
Let me let me answer that. Okay, he hates all brightness and sunlight

29:04.720 --> 29:09.560
He hates that. He just doesn't want any bright light. I don't like it

29:09.560 --> 29:15.760
Well, it it hurt your eyes that room where the light comes out. That's the room where he keeps all of his joy. Yeah

29:16.280 --> 29:21.040
Yeah, and he has to pull that shade down to make sure no joy escape. I'm not a big daylight guy

29:21.040 --> 29:26.760
He doesn't like Sun doesn't like sunshine. I caught you know what I call the Sun. What yellow Hitler?

29:29.720 --> 29:31.720
That's two times. I don't like it it

29:35.040 --> 29:37.040
It seeks to

29:37.040 --> 29:39.600
Invade and annex my my life

29:40.120 --> 29:45.680
I'm like, I'd be so much happier just working like at night. I would I'd understand that the Sun is

29:46.320 --> 29:48.880
important on some levels

29:48.880 --> 29:53.840
To life on earth, right? I do get that. Okay, but

29:54.840 --> 30:00.480
Personally, I find it offensive. I really do. It's bright and hot and it's ridiculous

30:00.480 --> 30:07.600
So but if you if you went into a room and someone had put a giant ball of flaming gas in the corner

30:07.840 --> 30:10.760
You would be like can can someone deal with this?

30:11.080 --> 30:15.840
But don't you get don't you get depressed like I'm from Chicago and if I don't get enough sunlight

30:15.840 --> 30:19.600
I get that seasonal effect disorder. You don't get depressed at all. I'm too narcissistic

30:19.600 --> 30:23.160
The the Sun doesn't cheer me up. It competes with me

30:26.280 --> 30:28.920
I don't wow I don't get depressed I

30:30.000 --> 30:35.320
Get depressed when the Sun starts fucking fucking up my shit. Get out of here yellow Hitler

30:35.320 --> 30:41.000
What do you want? And it's like I've been here for eight billion years. I'm like, oh, what I thought I'll pull off

30:41.240 --> 30:43.000
I'll take your word for it

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
What have you done for me lately?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
There's a new Sun in town

30:48.760 --> 30:52.240
All right, so that's your secret. It's just being narcissistic

30:52.240 --> 30:57.440
I don't know. I genuinely like I have a vitamin D deficiency. I just got diagnosed with it began

30:57.440 --> 31:00.560
It's probably obviously because you hate yellow Hitler

31:00.560 --> 31:06.200
I really are a very sensitive to light and heat and stuff. I'd rather be hot than cold

31:06.200 --> 31:12.320
But I just you know, I like I'm with Dan. I don't like the Sun either. I don't like going out doing things. I

31:12.320 --> 31:14.320
I

31:14.720 --> 31:23.520
associate I associate the outdoors with a lot of rigamarole like just a lot of just a lot of non-commodore 64 programming a

31:24.080 --> 31:27.480
Lot of a lot of just like why can't you hit this ball with this stick?

31:27.480 --> 31:31.520
What's wrong with you? And there's no like give me a typewriter

31:32.160 --> 31:39.160
Like it's a it just it's just like it's bright and it's like everything out there is fake and and bullshit and like

31:39.160 --> 31:46.120
When you're your dad survived the polio epidemic and he so he has one withered leg and those moments when he does try out of

31:46.120 --> 31:49.720
Father guilt to take you in the front yard and throw the baseball with you

31:49.720 --> 31:54.240
It's like really embarrassing and that's like I associate the Sun with social anxiety

31:55.520 --> 31:57.520
guilt shame

31:57.520 --> 32:03.280
Bullying recess was the worst like as bad as school was it was like the bell would ring and everyone would go

32:03.280 --> 32:07.400
Yay, we get to go outside and play more baseball than in gym class

32:07.400 --> 32:10.520
you fucking assholes I

32:11.240 --> 32:17.360
Would just find the darkest like bush that I could find and like there'd be two other kids in there

32:17.360 --> 32:20.720
And they'd go did you see Jaws again? Yeah, I did I

32:21.400 --> 32:25.360
Saw it as much as I fucking good. I can't wait to watch Jaws again

32:26.080 --> 32:31.320
So so turning all the lights out at three o'clock in the afternoon you're recreating your childhood basically

32:31.320 --> 32:39.600
I'm crooked. Yeah, I'm trying to deprive my senses and enter a more comfortable zone. I hid under my bed until I was 24

32:43.480 --> 32:45.480
Did you see Rob's biopic powder

32:46.080 --> 32:51.760
Yeah, yes. Yeah, I'm trying to get I'm trying this is getting ridiculous here

32:54.040 --> 32:56.040
Somebody's playing a joke

32:56.040 --> 33:01.280
I put your glasses back on this is

33:09.840 --> 33:13.480
There you go, but he's not he's currently get with it. Oh, I do

33:18.800 --> 33:23.960
What if the world I'm gonna talk you guys figure out what the monkey did my monkey

33:23.960 --> 33:29.680
How can I get the Chicago franchise of your show? I know there's a there's a bidding war going on right now

33:29.680 --> 33:31.680
Yeah, that's why I'm out here in LA

33:33.040 --> 33:37.600
What you can yeah, what's yours? What's your what's your deal?

33:37.760 --> 33:43.760
Yeah, it depends on what your favorite number from their gut from their show is I mean if you wanted them

33:43.760 --> 33:46.440
Jeff I love trying to force your favorite number

33:47.480 --> 33:52.080
Number I think the number oh shit the ending number. I mean that's very sad

33:52.080 --> 33:59.320
That's a very sad. It's sad Jimmy. Do you think the Chicago can afford it? No rights to the ending number of Rob

34:00.120 --> 34:04.440
Maybe for a weekend. We could do like a weekend run. Yeah, we could do like a limited run

34:04.440 --> 34:07.280
Yeah, I can do that, but me and Schrab would do it

34:08.000 --> 34:12.560
Right. Yeah, is it fair to you can play David Cross's part. Thank you

34:14.120 --> 34:19.240
God what if there's a reason it's possible to get David Cross's like in here right now. Oh

34:19.240 --> 34:24.200
God if David Cross is listen watching if he walked in and it was subscriber

34:24.200 --> 34:28.840
The the special effects from time cop would start happening and you guys would all start turning into pudding

34:30.400 --> 34:36.120
What is that what you're trying to do to me right now? I want you to know what it's like

34:37.480 --> 34:39.480
I love it

34:39.480 --> 34:41.480
I'm in heaven. I

34:42.320 --> 34:44.320
Wish every day was like this

34:44.320 --> 34:50.040
This is the best your glasses don't fit. Hey, Jimmy. They don't fit my face

34:50.880 --> 34:52.880
Yes, Dan. What is

34:53.520 --> 34:56.560
Like what is the when you teach an improv class?

34:57.560 --> 35:00.040
What's the what is the first thing you start with timing?

35:07.600 --> 35:09.600
Yes, I start with timing

35:09.600 --> 35:12.000
I

35:12.000 --> 35:17.600
Can't do you ever to do teach people just off the street anymore or do you just know I've become

35:18.160 --> 35:24.120
That good I don't have to teach off the street anymore. You just you just you just teach but you teach people that pay Dan

35:24.120 --> 35:28.280
That's what I'm looking for Jimmy. What where do you teach? What where in Chicago? I teach?

35:28.280 --> 35:33.280
I actually teach for myself. I teach it stage 773 and green shirt studio

35:33.800 --> 35:38.640
Yeah, do you do like like I'm assuming long form because you're Chicago. Yes, I do long form. Yes

35:38.640 --> 35:43.400
Is it do you do the heraldy thing or do you do your own like just let let things be what they are?

35:43.400 --> 35:48.560
I do I do something called the artist low comedy, which is basically let's just be let's you know

35:49.120 --> 35:54.680
Slow it down a little not trying to be funny and it's just gonna it'll happen. It's listening right exactly

35:55.400 --> 35:57.400
What did you say exactly?

35:58.720 --> 36:03.520
Do people know people know you have an improv background you go all the way back to comedy sports in Milwaukee

36:03.520 --> 36:05.520
It's all yet. Well, that's where we met

36:05.520 --> 36:11.360
It's short form though, but I always when I go to see it. Well, what I want one thing I wanted to ask you, okay?

36:12.080 --> 36:16.960
Because I think this is important like because like if you're you're in Chicago

36:16.960 --> 36:20.320
You're at the epicenter of long good long-form improv

36:20.960 --> 36:28.760
In LA where it's not necessarily a you know, but but but but you tell tell these kids listening if they live in LA

36:29.160 --> 36:33.480
Where would you recommend they go if they want to see the in your opinion?

36:33.480 --> 36:38.080
Just like creme de la creme long-form improv in Chicago or Los Angeles, Los Angeles

36:38.080 --> 36:42.880
Oh Los Angeles. I think the UCB is got is is is just great

36:43.440 --> 36:46.920
Rob do they still do they do ask it right?

36:46.920 --> 36:53.120
Yeah, they do every Sunday night, and then I think competing with this show there. There's some shows at the Iowa West

36:53.880 --> 37:00.560
Weird dance with Bob Dassey and Stephanie where they're a dasa risky, which is he was on community Craig Kikowski

37:00.560 --> 37:06.600
Rich, Tolerico and Bob. They're the best improvisers those three. Yeah. Yeah, I think yeah

37:06.600 --> 37:09.840
I saw Stephanie where do I think with that? You know Joe bill?

37:10.240 --> 37:12.240
Yes, yeah from Chicago

37:12.640 --> 37:18.480
Mark Sutton the bass prof. Yeah, was two two guys sitting in a fake boat and just talk forever

37:18.480 --> 37:24.160
And Stephanie where it came on and she absolutely killed it and they asked me to be honest like no, I'm scared

37:24.160 --> 37:31.400
Yeah, because like that's that's really like ballsy improv. I did a show with Stephanie years ago at cold naked

37:31.400 --> 37:36.120
It was just two of us. We did one long scene. It was in your apartment. Yes

37:37.840 --> 37:40.480
The laws the laws were different back then Dan

37:41.720 --> 37:48.240
It's a long form long form bathtub scene. Yeah. Yeah, but there was no light. There's no lighting. It was dark

37:48.240 --> 37:56.680
You would have liked but it was she was the she was one of the best improvisers I've ever worked with yeah

37:57.280 --> 37:58.280
the

37:58.280 --> 38:00.440
the amount of like self-control and

38:01.320 --> 38:04.240
for real listening and eye contact and

38:04.960 --> 38:11.440
Letting things build based on like absolute attention is really amazing. There's not something

38:11.880 --> 38:13.880
Why I was talking

38:13.880 --> 38:16.880
Reverse

38:18.000 --> 38:23.280
There is it is it's about listening because when I watch long form improv and people are good at it

38:23.280 --> 38:28.880
I'm like, how the fuck like like there's no I can only think about one thing at once and

38:29.240 --> 38:32.760
At a time and like like for instance how to construct a sentence

38:35.280 --> 38:39.080
But if when I'm offstage in those moments of him doing it

38:39.080 --> 38:46.880
It's like I can't I'm like if somebody says like this is great soup and then I'm like soup soup soup soup dot connecting soup

38:46.880 --> 38:52.400
And then like they're talking about all kinds of shit the other person saying something like you have to actually absorb it and process it

38:52.400 --> 38:58.320
The same things that make you good at long-form improv are the things that that that probably make you a good person in like a conversation

38:59.920 --> 39:06.400
I know some great long-form improv is that I wouldn't call like great like socially like interactive people like this

39:06.400 --> 39:10.280
you there is an ability to like really focus and

39:12.080 --> 39:17.720
Also, you can be any kind of person and be good at long-form improv. I think and here's another rule about long-form improv

39:18.160 --> 39:20.160
Always let the guests speak

39:20.920 --> 39:22.920
They can that's why it's why I'm sorry

39:25.400 --> 39:29.680
No, but you're like for me like for the podcast improv nerd

39:29.680 --> 39:34.560
I've had I've interviewed over like 180 people and and I don't you know

39:34.560 --> 39:41.120
I don't have a journalist. Well, everybody has but yeah, 180 noteworthy people. Yes. Yes. Thank you dad

39:42.000 --> 39:45.080
And of course I got into podcasting for the money, you know

39:45.080 --> 39:50.960
Yes, I went from public radio, and I'm like, you know what this podcasting there's more money than public radio

39:50.960 --> 39:53.280
They should call it cha-ching castig. Yes, they're really

39:54.640 --> 39:56.640
That sounds racist one

39:58.640 --> 40:01.520
Slightly racist that's why they don't do it. I think that's my theory

40:01.520 --> 40:06.040
Yeah, but you're podcasting so you can get away with racist stuff that you can't get on terrestrial radio

40:06.080 --> 40:11.200
You get away with it. It's demanded of me. Yes. Yeah, they're well if I don't feed these people racism though

40:11.200 --> 40:13.480
They'll go over to Marin. Yeah, exactly

40:14.120 --> 40:20.800
People were lined up in front tonight like we want more race. We want it. I didn't want to tell you this but that's what they're looking for build that wall

40:20.800 --> 40:26.520
Yeah, baby drill. Yeah, Harmon Harmon Harmon because you're gonna come out and endorse Trump in a couple minutes

40:26.520 --> 40:31.400
Did I give it away? I've got look. I've been endorsing him since he was in Pizza Hut commercials. I

40:32.200 --> 40:37.940
Said I was like, can we elect him to do all pizza commercials? Why does he have to be just Pete Pizza Hut? Right?

40:38.640 --> 40:42.940
I was I was the first person to sign the make him orange er

40:44.120 --> 40:48.800
Petition, right? I want him to be so orange that he's a literal orange

40:48.800 --> 40:56.080
Yeah, is it okay to say that tonight's proceeds are going to his campaign? Absolutely. If you stepped in this building you helped him

40:57.760 --> 41:00.840
Take over the world and kill minorities. Yeah

41:02.720 --> 41:04.720
Until minorities

41:05.040 --> 41:06.640
kill

41:06.640 --> 41:09.880
Minorities it feels bad when you make me repeat it. Yeah

41:10.760 --> 41:16.080
It's even worse when that's the title of this episode. It's called kill minorities. I

41:16.080 --> 41:19.200
Don't even want to say it because I would feel really bad

41:19.800 --> 41:23.560
Can I share something what happened when I flew into for this show?

41:24.080 --> 41:29.520
Can I yes, you can all right flew in for this show? I did I don't have much going on

41:32.960 --> 41:34.960
So I

41:35.200 --> 41:38.160
If you listen to the podcast, you know, I have a lot of low self-esteem

41:38.160 --> 41:43.080
And so I was feeling a lot of shame when because I was thinking about an interview I had just done

41:43.080 --> 41:45.880
And so I wrote on the top of my notebook

41:46.520 --> 41:48.920
that I want to die and

41:49.680 --> 41:55.280
somebody who was sitting across the the aisle saw it and went to the back of the

41:56.080 --> 41:58.240
the the airlines and then

41:59.680 --> 42:04.280
The flight attendant comes and says can we see you in the back Jesus Christ?

42:04.280 --> 42:11.520
It's like Rosemary's baby back there. Yeah, we've been waiting for you. Yeah

42:13.240 --> 42:16.440
So I say, you know what you got a problem and she goes

42:18.840 --> 42:21.640
She goes well, we hope not all right

42:22.440 --> 42:27.960
Both sides of this conversation are ill right you guys were both saying exactly the wrong things right

42:27.960 --> 42:34.880
Do we have a problem? I hope not right, right? So

42:36.320 --> 42:40.800
So I go back to the you know, they take me all the way back to where the bathrooms are at the back of the plane

42:40.800 --> 42:42.800
And now it's three

42:42.800 --> 42:46.480
Flight attendants and she's the head so hot dear penthouse

42:46.480 --> 42:56.720
And so I want to die because my dick's so big that's the detail you left out

42:58.960 --> 43:03.560
Could you can I need a character witness at court so if in case I'm gonna call you

43:04.240 --> 43:11.720
So it also when it went I was also I had my my phone out my what is this dick your dick

43:11.720 --> 43:18.800
You can say dick. Okay. I thought as a podcast you know, no you can say anything so I had my my iPhone out

43:18.800 --> 43:26.040
And I was timing myself so she goes all right someone complained that you had written you you want to die and

43:26.720 --> 43:30.000
Why did you have your your cell phone out on a timer?

43:30.000 --> 43:35.120
And I said because I was meditating which was a total which was totally true

43:36.080 --> 43:38.560
She says well, you know, this is really serious whatever

43:38.560 --> 43:41.960
So I go back and I sit in the I sit back in in my seat

43:41.960 --> 43:46.400
And I like I know the Pete the guy who's doing it, but I don't want to make eye contact

43:46.400 --> 43:52.320
Wait, can you can you rewind because I just in that moment which is really crucial because they summoned you back

43:52.320 --> 43:57.320
And they said all that stuff and you're you're getting to a destination in the story, but at that moment

43:57.320 --> 44:02.080
What the fuck good question like like you wrote this and why are you telling me I was meditating and then

44:02.600 --> 44:06.120
She's like well, this is a big deal and then you go back to your seat like

44:06.120 --> 44:11.880
How did that conversation really there's some suicidal thoughts in there Dan and then there's like oh my god

44:11.880 --> 44:13.920
What the fuck have I done? No, what is she said?

44:13.920 --> 44:16.640
Well, what is happening in that moment that before you go back to your seat?

44:16.640 --> 44:20.240
I'm like as much dialogue as you can remember of that see is I'm going back to the seat

44:20.240 --> 44:24.880
No, no before you go back to the seat before I these people have summoned you from your seat

44:24.880 --> 44:29.920
Oh, okay. I don't know. I don't know what I don't know what I'm like. What what have I done?

44:30.240 --> 44:33.640
Partly thinks maybe they're gonna upgrade me to first class, but I know that's a stretch

44:33.640 --> 44:35.640
Oh

44:39.240 --> 44:41.240
But I'm saying like in the moment

44:42.640 --> 44:49.200
Fascinated by this so so you say you're not adult. This is a big deal and you went uh-huh and just faded back

44:49.240 --> 44:51.240
That's that's the part that I'm talking about

44:52.000 --> 44:57.360
Because that sounds like just like it's it sounds like I'm about to find out that life is controlled by a

44:57.360 --> 44:59.520
An eight-year-old playing with Barbie dolls

44:59.520 --> 45:02.680
Well, it's a big deal. Okay

45:04.920 --> 45:09.200
I'm gonna be more to that. No, I'm glad you clear that up that I don't want to give that impression

45:09.200 --> 45:15.000
It was not it wasn't that at all. It was what the I'm in trouble. I have been summoned by the principal

45:15.000 --> 45:21.400
I don't know what it is, but if authority has asked me to go to the back of the airplane. I must have done something wrong

45:21.920 --> 45:23.920
right

45:24.120 --> 45:28.760
But in that moment, okay, wait, okay, can we do it to me with you? I'm with you

45:28.760 --> 45:33.120
I'm improv. I will be the flight attendant. Okay, great. Great. Okay. Okay, sir

45:33.640 --> 45:35.640
That's that well first of all, okay?

45:36.480 --> 45:42.600
I'm gonna sit on this like I'm really sitting in the seat. Okay, cuz I'm okay. We'll start there. Okay. Good. Okay

45:48.760 --> 45:53.560
We're traveling at 35,000 feet cruising altitude

45:53.560 --> 45:59.800
If you look out to the left, you'll see the Grand Canyon

46:04.360 --> 46:09.120
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been asked to inform you that one of the microphones is available

46:10.240 --> 46:13.200

46:13.200 --> 46:23.240
And how passengers I'm your captain a

46:26.840 --> 46:33.480

46:34.120 --> 46:36.120
gentlemen clearly

46:36.440 --> 46:38.440
Ladies and gentlemen

He's ready. There's some weird shit. Well, we better get somebody on that. Who do we have there?

47:20.180 --> 47:25.180
We have our best flight attendant on the job. Oh my god guys. It's Stacey

47:27.180 --> 47:31.100
As you can probably hear there's some drama in the cockpit

47:31.100 --> 47:34.900
It's captain evil and dr. Awesome are flying the plane

47:36.180 --> 47:38.460
They go at it like cats in a bath

47:39.100 --> 47:42.540
But they are great and they have landed over 500

47:43.860 --> 47:49.460
Awesome, so just return to your things the other two captains were just crazy people with a microphone

47:50.820 --> 47:56.560
But those have been turned off. I'm gonna I'll go about your cabin and have a bun

48:45.040 --> 48:52.360
Okay, everybody. This is Stacey. That's not true. The plane is nowhere near the Sun that would make it a spaceship

48:53.200 --> 48:58.120
We will be landing in California, and I won't tell you the city. It'll be a surprise

48:59.360 --> 49:03.760

Excuse me, sir. Um, yeah, yes, could you see us in the back of the plane? Is there a problem? You have a problem?

49:18.680 --> 49:29.360

I don't want you to kill yourself. I'd only kill myself if you didn't say what you just said

57:22.260 --> 57:26.540
It seems like a perfectly healthy relationship

57:29.860 --> 57:36.580
We should build in like 50 years on this and involve children and strangers

57:37.700 --> 57:39.700
I'd kill myself if you loved me

57:40.500 --> 57:42.580
It's almost like we're

57:42.580 --> 57:44.580
Dependent at the same time

57:45.060 --> 57:46.860
On each other

57:46.860 --> 57:48.860
Sounds great

57:48.860 --> 57:52.380
I realize now that I got into the air travel biz

57:53.540 --> 57:55.540
because

57:56.940 --> 57:58.940
Sorry, I

57:59.300 --> 58:02.100

58:02.100 --> 58:15.180
Swing it

58:15.180 --> 58:34.300
Parachute compartment.

58:34.300 --> 58:40.480
Do not tamper with parachutes.

58:40.480 --> 58:45.180
B-pen container.

58:45.180 --> 58:59.880
That's what you get when you fuck with me.

58:59.880 --> 59:13.200
This is Captain Evil.

59:13.200 --> 59:18.400
If you look at the left side of your plane, you'll see Samantha safely parachuting to

59:18.400 --> 59:19.400
her.

59:19.400 --> 59:20.400
To her not death.

59:20.400 --> 59:21.400
She's fine.

59:21.400 --> 59:22.400
She's fine.

59:22.400 --> 59:23.400
She has a parachute.

59:23.400 --> 59:27.400
It's going to be okay.

59:27.400 --> 59:41.080
We were at a low altitude, she's going to be alright.

59:41.080 --> 59:43.160
Hello?

59:43.160 --> 59:44.160
Natalie?

59:44.160 --> 59:51.720
This is Samantha, I think.

59:51.720 --> 59:52.720
Or maybe Rebecca?

59:52.720 --> 59:53.720
I'm not sure.

59:53.720 --> 59:54.720
Stacey, possibly.

59:54.720 --> 59:55.720
Maybe Stacey.

59:55.720 --> 59:56.720
Hello, yes?

59:56.720 --> 59:57.720
Are you falling much?

59:57.720 --> 59:58.720
I'm falling.

59:58.720 --> 59:59.720
I'm falling.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.720
But this parachute, there's something written on it.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.720
Oh, for...

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:10.720
Oh, this is so real nice.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.720
Just real nice.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.720
Real nice.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:21.280
I bet you think you're pretty cool now, stopping time, being cool now.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.680
I tried to help you.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.480
I tried to help you with your disfigurement.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.880
Were you trying to help me?

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.880
Yeah.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:33.680
I said to the pilot, you should watch Bojack Horseman, and you were like, that's stupid.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.080
And you were like undercutting me.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.880
And I said, you should watch a basket.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.760
And you were like, that's stupid.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:49.320
You don't have good taste in comedy, and now you're going to have great taste in pavement.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.640
I guess you win.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.040
I guess you win.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.320
You don't guess I win.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320
I guess you win.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320
I guess you win.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.320
I guess...

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.320
What are you going to do with all that...

01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.320
That win?

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.320
What are you going to do with that?

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320
Win now?

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320
You're going to...

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.880
You're going to buy a smile with that?

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.880
Probably not.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.320
Because you're a big, fat piece of shit and no one likes.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.480
You're a big, fat piece of shit and no one likes.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.240
And all the customers hate you too.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.240
They tell me...

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.840
Tell me that you're a big, fat piece of shit.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.840
You're a piece of shit.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:27.840
Stop time for her!

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:41.320
Feel the air marshal cabinet.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320
Point break.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.320
Point break.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:49.800
Point break.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.800
Stop time for me too!

01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:12.800
Resume time for both of us!

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.720
Three hours later.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.240
So what do you make of this, Sergeant?

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:27.760
Looks to me like a girl, man and another girl, shot her, both exploded.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:34.640
But don't you think it all kind of started with that guy who kind of made a weird suicide

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.320
note on the plane?

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.960
Don't know what you're talking about.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.920
Like in this municipality, just underneath the...

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:49.040
Isn't anybody concerned also that this plane was being captained by a guy named Captain

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.760
Awesome and Captain Evil?

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.320
What kind of business are we running here?

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.800
I didn't know there were planes involved.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.240
I'm Woody Harrelson.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:06.240
And I'm Pineapple.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:16.480
And with all due God damn respect, Pineapple, why don't you either just do the God damn

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:22.040
police work or shoot my job.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:26.440
It's in the way that you use it.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.920
Those are the credits.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.040
So Jimmy, is that how it happened?

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.040
Jimmy, great that, great that.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.040
I'm going to ask Rod something.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.040
I'm going to ask you something.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.920
How many times do you think we could have edited that?

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920
Oh, Jesus.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.680
I was like, oh my God, let's edit here.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.120
Is that what you do as an instructor?

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.120
You're like...

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.120
Yeah, well...

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.120
You edit it.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.280
You stop the scene at a point where it really begged to be ended.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.280
Yeah.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.280
And I think we did...

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.240
I mean, it was amazing because we like ran over the body like five, six, seven, eight

01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.240
times.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.240
It was amazing.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.800
Because like in long form, once it hits, right?

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800
Yeah.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.840
The laugh cannot go any higher.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.560
It's so easy, you just run across the scene like that.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.560
Right.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.560
And it's done.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.560
Right.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.560
Yeah, but then you got to get up.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.560
We could have just done something like that.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.560
Then you got to get up and walk.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.560
No, I know.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:23.760
So you're trying to tell me a lady stopping time while her arch enemy is six feet above

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:29.200
the pavement so that she can dive down with a gun, freeze time for herself next to the

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.880
body, and then unfreeze time for both of them so that she can have the pleasure of blowing

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.560
her friend's brains out before they both hit the pavement.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.400
That wasn't worth 95 minutes of terrible improv.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.200
Let's say I'm Jimmy Crane, everybody.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.200
Oh, Jimmy!

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.200
Thank you.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.200
Thank you so much.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.200
Listen to his podcast on Feral Audio.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.200
Thank you.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:57.800
Also, while we say goodbye to Jimmy, thank you so much, Jimmy.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.800
Let's bring out our other guests who just arrived.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.800
Let's bring out Cameron Esposito.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.800
Yay!

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800
Yay!

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800
Yay!

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.800
Yay!

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800
Yay!

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800
Well, guys!

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800
That was a hell of a scene!

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800
You like that?

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:26.800
I thought, I mean, I was, my suspense, I was with you to the end, you know?

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.800
I played a character named Pineapple.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.520
Oh, I heard the name of your character, and I thought it was believably your name, you

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.520
know?

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.000
I just thought, like, the way you effect it, it was mostly, it was a lot of what you're

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
doing with me.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I really appreciate that.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Yeah, you're welcome.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.480
Cameron, do you think that scene suffered from any structure problems, or do you think

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.480
that the whole time?

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.480
No, I don't.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:53.240
I will say that I was watching some of it on a little TV in there, and there was also

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:58.800
just, like, I don't know if you guys realize how much the three of you just look like a

01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.800
little team.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.640
You talked about that.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.680
Just, like, three little, just, you know what I mean, just, and you were on your own vibe

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:11.600
and that was cool, but it was just, like, a, just, a real, what do you mean?

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:15.680
It was just a real, I think what I'm saying is it just looked like a real sitcom, you

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.680
know what I mean?

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:17.680
Yeah.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.680
Just a bunch of dudes.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.680
So Esposito.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.920
A bunch of similar white dudes, but it was called New Girl.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.640
They should have a, yeah.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:31.320
No, it was one girl, but, like, a bunch of dudes, the dudes kept moving in.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.320
Some of them were black.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.320
They were two black.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.320
Pineapple.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.320
Thank God.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.320
Pineapple was a woman.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.320
No, I know.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.320
I just, I, you know, I heard a number.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:44.080
You're one of my, I'm caught, I sound like I'm dying for the whole thing, you're one

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.840
of my CISO mates, you're doing a, and you're stand-up special.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.560
People are having to wait for Harmon Quest for a little bit, but you're, you just did

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.040
a stand-up special and it's on CISO.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.040
Just came out.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.040
It's called Marriage Material.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.040
I just thought I'd randomly bring those.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.040
You should.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:01.400
That is not, of course that's not why I'm here.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.480
I did not specifically, it's called Marriage Material.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.480
Marriage Material.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.920
Isn't that a good name for a stand-up special?

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920
Yeah.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.840
I, I taped it two days before my wedding.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:10.840
So.

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:15.040
How is the marriage going for those who don't know, Rhea Butcher, who guest-controlled a

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.040
couple of episodes ago?

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.040
Oh yeah.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.040
This guy was, he just goes, whoa.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.040
Yeah.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.040
Well, I mean, she's great.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.040
Right.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.040
I mean, it was just like either her or Tig, right?

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.040
You know what I mean?

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:32.720
I don't know if you've listened to that episode, but in the middle of it I was like, come on,

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.720
you don't know Tig Nataro.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.040
And she's like, I swear I don't.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.040
I'm like, come on.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.040
She knows Tig.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.040
She liked you.

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.640
One time Tig goes, cool shirt.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.040
And then the next time we saw Tig, she was totally wearing that shirt.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:47.040
Oh.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.040
So you married another comic.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.040
I did.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:53.040
So now you're, what, six months into that marriage?

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.040
Three only.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.040
We've only been married for three months.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.040
Oh.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.040
Yeah.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.040
A little nascent.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.040
So honeymoon still and sort of.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.040
But you guys were, were you cohabitating before that?

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.040
Yes.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.040
Yeah.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.040
Living together.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.040
Not to enforce the stereotype.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.040
No, right.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:13.040
Well, I mean, we are lesbians, but we waited to live together until marriage.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.040
How many golden retrievers do you guys have?

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.040
We just have one, but he's so small.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.040
He only weighs eight pounds.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.040
He's a teeny little guy.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.040
Is there, like, I mean, it's probably too early to tell us the answer, but once you're,

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.040
once you're under the same roof and you guys are both doing the same thing, like, do you,

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:36.040
do you ever worry about like that?

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040
I don't know.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040
It's a major problem.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040
Competition.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.040
I'm not kidding at all.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040
It's a major problem.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040
I had a girlfriend once.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:49.040
Like 1999, I had a, I had a TV pilot and as a writer, she had a TV pilot at the same

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:56.040
network and we both, we saw it coming and I sat her down and was like, look, it's absolutely

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.040
impossible that both of our pilots are going to go.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.040
Hopefully both of our pilots don't go.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.040
What if one of our pilots goes and the other one doesn't?

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.040
Let's consider that possibility now and make some rules.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:12.040
And then in my head, I now, looking back, I realized that when I was having that talk

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:18.040
with her, I was only doing it to prepare her for the absolute inevitability that my pilot

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.040
was going to go and hers wasn't.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.040
Her pilot was Malcolm in the middle.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.040
Oh.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:33.040
Mine was Heat Vision and Jack and I couldn't fucking handle it.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:37.040
I was like, I'm out of here.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.040
So I'm wondering, like two stand-ups, like, let me say Roof, like, do you worry?

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.040
It's a lot of Malcolm's, it for sure is.

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.040
Do you guys talk about that?

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.040
We talk about it all the time.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.040
I mean, I've known her, we met doing stand-ups.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:53.040
So I knew, you know, I mean, obviously I knew this was what was always going to happen.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:59.040
I will say the positive and those of you that have ever seen Rhea Performer, if you know

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.040
her, she's, I mean, just brilliant, she's a brilliant comic.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.040
Youp!

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.040
Youp!

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.040
Youp!

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.040
Cameron, there's one of our fans who says youp a lot.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040
Is that true?

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.040
It means he likes it.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.040
Okay, great.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.040
It's like snarf, uh, thundercats.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.040
Right.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.040
To put it in lesbian terms.

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.040
Wait, when I met, we never say snarf, but we do snarf a lot.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.040
When I met, uh, when I met Rhea, we were wearing the same Wolverine boots.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.040
Yeah.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.040
And I was like, hey, we're wearing the same boots.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.040
Yeah.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.040
And she was like, yeah.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.040
And we started talking about the care of our boots.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.040
And then Karen said, she's like, every dude that meets Rhea talks about boots.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.040
It is for them.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.040
And I was like, oh, shit.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:57.040
Well, do you know what is actually a, no, it's actually awesome to see because she is,

01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:03.040
like on the spectrum of human people, she is like real, she's in a real James Dean area.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.040
And so dudes, I like,

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.040
I felt cool because I was wearing the same boots.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.040
Yeah, exactly.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.040
Dude, she's like, she's either aspirational for men or men are flirting with her, but

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040
I was kind of flirting with her.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040
In a homoerotic way.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040
I was.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.040
It's like, dude, I can just see dudes like,

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.040
She's also super hot.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.040
Yeah.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.040
Thank you.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.040
She's pretty looking.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.040
Yeah.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.040
She's beautiful.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.040
She has, she has cool style.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.040
You have cool styles.

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.040
Yeah.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.040
Right.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.040
We still have to iron out those rules.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.040
But by the way, I'm trying.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.040
I don't know what the etiquette is.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.040
Your wife's hot.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.040
She's hot.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.040
She's hot.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.040
No, that's okay.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.040
It still feels like a wild west.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.040
I will say, I mean, yeah, fucking she's hot.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.040
I'll fucking take that all day long.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.040
Sure.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.040
What an insult.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.040
And you vowed to wear this great boots.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040
How do you say that?

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.040
Can I ask you a personal question?

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.040
Yeah.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.040
When you guys are snarling, how does that work?

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.040
What does snarling entail?

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:08.040
So what it is, is we'll be right in the middle of looking to each other's eyes.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.040
And then we'll call a dude, whoever.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.040
Any dude.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:17.040
Guy on the street, our oldest friend.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.040
And then he comes over.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.040
And then we fuck him.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.040
Snarling?

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.040
You guys.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.040
What is snarling?

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.040
I am not going to explain lesbian sex to you.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:35.040
There was a lot of you that thought that I was serious.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.040
There's, there's, there may be a snarling a thing.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.040
Is that?

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040
No.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040
That's the point.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.040
Snarling is a character from Denicats.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.040
Yeah.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.040
Okay, is that a thing?

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040
Yeah.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.040
That's, I was, I was making the joke that all lesbians are into thundercats.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.040
Like I was like making up a new stereotype.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.040
And literally they are.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.040
I mean, Chitara, give me a break.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.040
Yeah.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.040
No, I mean, that's my, well, I just, you know what?

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:05.040
I also have to tell you guys, I just saw Batman vs Superman, but also don't see it.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.040
Like I just saw it a second ago.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.040
Spiders don't see it.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:15.040
But I wanted to see it with a group of friends and then the theater was very full, you know,

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.040
because it's the opening weekend or whatever, and Wonder Woman.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.040
Yeah.

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:25.040
She's in this movie for like two and a half minutes, but I mean, how do we snarf?

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.040
We go see Wonder Woman.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.040
I'm serious.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:33.040
Like Rita, like she, she, I mean, and this is, I'm just going to go ahead and spoil this.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:39.040
Like you do see her go like, when she appears, she's like, I mean, I stood up and it was

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.040
at the arc lights.

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.040
So that was a real problem.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.040
There she is.

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.040
You know, and then everyone was like,

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:51.040
Does she look like, does she look like sexy Linda Carter, like 70s, 80s Wonder Woman or?

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.040
She looks like,

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.040
I'm asking like, does she have high waisted boy shorts on?

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.040
Because that's, that's my kind of thing.

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.040
No, she's got like a cool superhero outfit on.

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.040
It is definitely very short.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.040
There's a part where she falls down and then her kind of, her kind of, but not, she's,

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.040
she's fighting so much.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.040
She doesn't fall down like the bed.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.040
But she needs a little help.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.040
She kind of slides under like a mechanic, you know, like it's.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.040
She slides under the glass ceiling.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.040
She slides under the glass ceiling.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.040
Which is there for her safety.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.040
I know.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.040
No, it is, it is.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:31.040
Contrary to all this chatter I'm seeing on the internet, it's for safety.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040
That, the whole.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.040
It's like a sneeze guard to the glass ceiling.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.040
But going up.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.040
It's there for protection.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.040
Right.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.040
It's, she, this whole movie is about dudes being so sad that they're superheroes.

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:49.040
It's like, it's like two dudes that are like, I'm, like this is, this is actually where we've,

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:54.040
this is the point we've gotten to with, with dude focused movies where now there's just

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:58.040
movies where dudes are like, I don't want any of this.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.040
You saying the, the fan response you mean?

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.040
I don't want it.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.040
No, like the guys on screen.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.040
You know them.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.040
Their names are Batman and Superman.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:12.040
The whole time they're like, I don't want to do it.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.040
That's what it looks like in the trailer that they're like, no, that Batman,

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.040
you hear Batman's voice and he's going, why is he so super?

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.040
That's a bad idea.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.040
And then Superman's like, it's because I gotta be super.

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.040
I don't have a choice.

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:31.040
And also PS, PS, Ben Affleck and, is it Henry Cavill?

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.040
Is that his name?

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:38.040
They are so giant in this movie, like this way.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.040
It feels like, it feels like the, it's out.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.040
It feels like they stretched the screen.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:47.040
And then they also, they, they're huge this way.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:53.040
And then they put, they were like, what will look normal on a man who is,

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:57.040
each individual peck is as wide as he is tall.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.040
And then, and then somebody was like, oh, for Batman, well,

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.040
he's not wearing the suit, put him in tweed.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:10.040
And tweed is like such a bulky fabric that Ben Affleck is like trying to,

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.040
walk, but he's just catching on fire.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:17.040
Like he can't.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:20.040
And so he's just staying, he can't, he can't really move.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.040
And then they're both, they're so huge.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.040
They're so huge.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:29.040
And then Wonder Woman just, the whole movie is, she's, she's like trying to figure out

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.040
if she's going to be Wonder Woman.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.040
I saw, I saw, did you, did you, did you see the trailer before you saw the movie?

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.040
I did.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.040
Cause I saw, I went to see Deadpool and I saw the, they played the,

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.040
Oh, you put a sock in it.

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:45.040
The last time this movie came up, I got punched in Miami.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.040
I went to see Deadpool with my girlfriend and they played the trailer before.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.040
I heard all this crazy shit.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:55.040
It was like, no one's anticipating Batman with, versus Superman or whatever it's called,

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.040
with, with well regard, if that's a phrase.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.040
Maybe I'm drunk.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.040
Maybe I'm dying.

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:05.040
The, but I saw the trailer and I was like, Oh, this, this doesn't look that bad.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.040
And I was bummed out and I want to confess why.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.040
Because I don't like Ben Affleck and I never have it.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.040
I've never wanted to see him win.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.040
Yes.

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.040
Yes.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.040
But now I feel twice as bad because now he's down.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.040
Have you seen the sad Affleck?

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.040
Yes.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:23.040
Now I don't even get to hate him with pleasure because now everyone hates him.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.040
I'm like, God damn it.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.040
That was my idea.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:31.340
Well, I, I have always, I've always found, I liked him when he was like, uh, when he

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.640
was the snot-nosed, like douchebag in movies.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.040
When he was the, like, for instance, in Days in Confused.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.040
Mwah.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.040
He's great at everything.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.040
Ben, that's it though.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.040
Yeah.

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.040
That was the end of it.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.040
Yes.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.040
Right.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.040
In, like, in Days in Confused.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.040
And then it ended.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.040
Yeah.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.040
In Days in Confused.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.040
And he was just a douchebag.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:53.040
Well, cause like Argo is such an insulting movie, I think, to American audiences and also

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:57.040
just to the world because, I don't know if you guys remember when that movie came out,

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:02.280
but the, the end of that movie is that a plane is rolling down the runway and Ben Affleck

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:08.040
is like, get in the car and they chase the plane in a car.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.040
And I remember seeing, cause it's based on a true story and I remember seeing it and

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.040
I was like, well this part didn't happen.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.040
And then I went home and I looked it up and it did not.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.040
Like there's no car chase.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.960
I don't even believe that the scene where they, that they must have built the movie around

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:26.800
where they explained the storyboards to security, I don't believe that happened either.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.640
Because it's like, oh, is this a Shakespeare in love?

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.640
Like what is this?

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.960
Like, like, like, to what extent do they fucking care?

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.320
It's just like, when you strip those things out that make the story interesting, it's

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.320
like, well, come on.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:41.280
Well, I feel like when, especially when you're dealing with life and death things and then

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:44.840
you just make it a movie that's like, Argo, fuck yourself.

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:48.200
We made up a phrase that doesn't mean anything.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.880
And it's the title of the movie.

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:57.000
Like that, that to me, it was so insulting and I have never recovered.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.720
I feel like I'm kicking a guy while he's down, but I also feel like I kept my, Ben Affleck

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:10.720
is the only person I've ever seen on screen be frustrated by a mentally challenged person.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:11.720
In what?

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:12.720
In How's Your News.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.720
Have you ever seen that?

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:17.200
Like there's a person mentally challenged interviewing him and he's in the, I guess he's

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:22.160
well intended because he's like working at some kind of democratic fundraiser and I think

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:28.640
in his head, he's like, why is this person asking me questions about the Daredevil movie?

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:37.440
And he's like, you can see him unlike every rodeo clown and banker and jailer and homeless

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.280
person that they interview in that movie.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:45.840
Everyone else goes like, you can see them cross the threshold of like, oh, you're different

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:51.160
from me neurologically and they, and they adjust and it's a very uplifting documentary

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.520
that rides the line between exploitation and fucking like the opposite of it because it's

01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:00.200
made by caretakers of, you know, blah, blah, blah, but like, I always, ever since I saw

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.840
that movie, I was like, you're fucking mad at a retarded guy for being retarded.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:04.840
That's crazy.

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.200
That's so crazy how mad you are at him.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.200
That's it.

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:11.080
Well, and I've always wanted to see him fail.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:15.320
I think that's a great, you know, um, you, when I was.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:21.560
And I'm sure this is, I'm sorry, the sad Batman, Ben Affleck, if you're listening.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.560
He's not listening.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.560
I think he is.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.560
What if he is?

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.560
Ben Affleck.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.880
What if this is the one?

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:34.240
He stopped listening during our airplane and he's already ducked out if he was listening.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:37.480
What if this, what if this podcast is the one thing he was coming to?

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480
I know.

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.480
That would be.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.480
This is not the thing.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.160
Do you know, I'm sure there's some people here that do you know what, when I was a kid,

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.800
there was an enrichment program that, uh, people did in grade school and it was called

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.400
the voyage of the Mimi and it was, uh, Mimi is great.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:59.680
It was called the voyage of the Mimi and you had to stay after school and you could watch

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:05.440
videos about like, I think they were shipwrecked children who had to problem solve and Ben

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:09.160
Affleck was in this series and he's like 11 years old.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:12.160
Um, so yes, so yes.

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.160
Yes.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:19.640
Now, yes, so you had to like pass a test and be like a, be like a, like a brain, you

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.840
know, like the, like a sad brainy kid and then you, and then you could stay after school

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.520
and you could watch voyage of the Mimi and they solve problems like they solve problems

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.800
like, we don't have any water.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.720
Let's put a tarp out and then the water will collect on the tarp and it will go into a

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.720
glass.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.720
You're describing the Illuminati.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:35.720
Yes.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:42.400
Cameron, did that build in a love of, uh, Affleck for you or did you, are you, are you predisposed

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.000
to like Ben Affleck because of that?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
No, I don't.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.360
I mean, I think I'm probably not, but I just mean, cause, cause when you were just saying

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.920
that, you know, like days and confuses, this like, you know, young heyday for him, I was

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:55.400
like, this guy's a geezer cause I had been, when he came on the scene though, you're like,

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.760
Oh, I know this guy since I was like a little girl.

01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.000
We came up together.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:10.160
I said, made him and met him because Dan and Rob and I met him on, uh, uh, what was the,

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.840
the, the Matt Damon, we met Ben Affleck.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.240
No, no, where, where, where I, where I first know him is, uh, what's that movie?

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.240
Good.

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.240
Good about hunting.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.880
That's, that's where he comes on the scene for me.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:26.280
Well, you've been sleeping cause that shit was around for a while.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:35.080
I hosted the GQ men of the year awards one year when I was on the daily show and by the

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.320
way, I just want to tell you, I was hoping you'd bring that up.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:45.600
That was the only year that, that award really held a really, ever since then it's lost its

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.600
meaning.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.600
Thank you.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.600
It was important.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:49.600
That was the year.

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.120
Who were the men of the year?

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:55.240
So that year, that year, let me answer that question.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:23:02.880
That year it was the men of the year ever, ever since then it's been just bullshit.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:10.160
I was doing it for the honor of doing that, not the money, not the loads of money they

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.000
were giving me to do that.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.840
I was doing it cause that was important to me.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:19.200
You thought that if you hosted man of the year, that it would be a ticket to becoming

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.320
man of the year later.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:27.040
So I went there and it was the first year that there was a bunch of men of the year

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:35.280
and the jackass guys were there and then in the table right in front of me was Al Gore,

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:42.920
Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck and behind Ben Affleck, holding him, Jennifer Garner.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.440
Holding him from behind.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.320
Well, please don't tell me anything negative about Jennifer Garner.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.880
No, she was great.

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:51.200
She comes out, the hero in this story.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.560
She's the hero in this story.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.560
She looks so good in the wings.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.920
Oh, she's the best.

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.360
She comes out the hero.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:02.760
So I wrote this whole comedy bit with a friend of mine and he was in the way back of the

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:06.200
room with my wife and it was really funny.

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.480
I thought it was very, very funny.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:14.480
And one of my, then I started, it was like a light roast of all the people there.

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.480
That's good, right?

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:22.200
Good to see Leonardo DiCaprio's here.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.200
He tips 19%.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.200
Yeah.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.200
That's exactly what I like.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.720
It's still way above what you should expect.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:33.680
So I started with, so I see the jackass guys are here and Steve Oh said, sit down, you

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.840
shit ass.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:41.320
So that was my first experience interacting with the audience.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.000
So that was immediately like out of my element.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.320
That's not even a term.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.360
He said, sit down, you shit ass.

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:53.360
I've met Steve Oh, the first time I met him, he took, he pulled up his shirt.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.600
He's got a tattoo of himself.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600
Himself.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.600
Yeah.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.960
And this was like full on drug years, Steve Oh, and he was, he's all sobered up now.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:04.520
Now it's the constitution.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.520
Yeah.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.520
Yeah.

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.520
He's become a libertarian.

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:13.920
I feel like I'd be able to connect with Steve Oh now that he's sober and on his back, now

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:17.400
a map to dry land and that's controversial, but it's true.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:21.840
So I said, he's just starting to get tattoos of other people now.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:31.200
I worked my way up to Ben Affleck and I said, Ben Affleck is here and Jen Garter was behind

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:36.960
Ben Affleck and she just started shaking her head at me and he was staring at me like

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:42.720
staring daggers at me and Jen Garter is going, don't, don't do it.

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.440
You're causing me six hours of paperwork.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:50.200
He's like, you love any respect for me.

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.080
You will not ruin my weekend.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.480
You will not like these apples.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:26:02.280
I had a bunch of jokes prepared.

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:07.160
This guy is an emotional China syndrome.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.800
Don't do it for him and do it for me.

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:18.320
So I said, Ben Affleck is here, Ben Affleck and I, the whole front row is in the fetal

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.920
position, Ben Affleck is here.

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.600
We, Ben and I have a lot in common.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:33.800
We're both from Boston, Ben, Ben, we, we both drive Maserati's except for me.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.680
That I thought was a really good joke.

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.160
That's fine.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.440
And then, and I said, this was terrible joke.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:47.080
I said, and when something like in the moment of climax, we both caught, we have both called

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:52.560
out J Lo's name.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.040
Something like that.

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.520
Just like a general proximity.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.520
Garner's head.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.520
She's like, whipping herself.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.320
She's like, I was protecting him.

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.320
What the fuck?

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.680
Giving herself whiplash saying no.

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:15.520
And, and then they excused me from the stage and Al Gore got up and he said, this is just

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.800
like Jimmy Carran's story.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.000
What the fuck happened right then and there?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.440
What do you mean they excused you from the stage?

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.440
No, this is what happened.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.440
And we never got a straight answer for it.

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.840
This is what happened.

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:30.840
Will Ferrell was there and he's the only one laughing at every one of my jokes.

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:41.960
He's the only one laughing at full volume and I didn't, I've, I've since, I don't know

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:46.120
whether he was laughing because he thought it was funny or he laughing because he felt

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.920
bad for me.

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:57.000
And then I left the stage and Al Gore got up and Al Gore said, well, we've all suffered

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.760
Rob Corddry's barbs.

01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.760
What?

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.000
No, Rob Corddry.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.400
He called me Rob Corddry.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.160
Rob Corddry's barbs.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.160
And that's when I yell.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.640
I like whispered to my wife in the back of the room, I said, start the car.

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:16.800
And then I got back up and I thanked everybody for being there.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.320
And Steve O yelled at me again.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.840
And then I walked off the stage and got right into my, just walked right into my car.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:24.840
I went home.

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:31.960
I'm sorry, Rob, is it because, uh, because he's so sacred, like what was the point?

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:32.960
Is it Ben Affleck?

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.960
Yeah.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:34.960
Yeah.

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:35.960
I guess, I guess that's the point.

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:36.960
That you are not allowed to make fun of Ben Affleck.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:37.960
I guess I was not allowed.

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:38.960
No, no, no, no.

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:44.920
I made some, I made some Leonardo DiCaprio jokes and there was nobody behind Leo going

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:45.920
no, no.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.040
No, it was Jennifer Garner was holding him from behind and she was like, she was like,

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:54.760
she was like, I know my boyfriend, husband, whatever he was to her, uh, my, my, my, my

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.760
ward.

01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:01.040
Uh, I know what's coming and I know I've dealt with this.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:05.440
I was at a cerebral palsy benefit and someone made a joke that he didn't understand and

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:11.400
it's been three days of, of fucking bringing him toasted cheese sandwiches and telling him

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:12.400
it'll be better.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:17.760
Don't fucking roast this guy if you care about Jennifer Garner's week.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.760
That's what was happening.

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.120
And then, and then his joke accidentally was like, it was like on her and she's like, I

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.120
don't believe it.

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:31.040
I really think in general roasting worst, worst job of, for people you don't have a relationship

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.040
with.

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040
No.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.040
Why?

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.040
And who hates me?

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.600
And why they do this to comics?

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.000
I will never understand.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.120
Like what I mean is we've, and if everybody's buddies or let's say it's Donald Trump and

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:47.440
he's like, I am benefiting enormously from being on comedy central and everybody is

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.360
going to make fun of me and I have signed up for this fully.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:54.680
But other than that, I feel like it's just like you're either Tina and Amy or don't

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.680
do it.

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:56.680
Don't do it.

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.680
Yeah.

01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.680
The answer is don't do it.

01:29:58.680 --> 01:29:59.680
Don't do it.

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:00.680
Don't do it.

01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:01.680
These are strangers.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:02.680
I made $35,000.

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:03.680
Hey.

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:05.680
Do it.

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:06.680
Do it.

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:07.680
Do it.

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:13.360
At a time when that was, that was, I was super cool with that.

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:17.680
Do you think you, do you, do you think you killed print media?

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:21.680
That might have been the night that it died.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.680
Yes.

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.680
Yeah.

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:24.680
That might have been the night.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680
You were like, let's save this magazine.

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.680
Who can we get on our side?

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.680
Al Gore and Ben Affleck.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.680
Sit down you shit-ass.

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:38.680
But don't just, don't just think it's Jennifer Garner was like holding him back because

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:40.680
she thinks like, oh, he's going to kick your ass.

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:41.680
No, no.

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:47.400
I did a movie with Jennifer Garner right after that and I was like, fuck, do I talk to her

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.400
about this?

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.520
Do I talk to her about this moment that we shared because we shared a moment and she has

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:58.680
to know about this moment and we didn't spend one second on it.

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:01.680
We didn't talk about it.

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.680
Wait, what year was this?

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:05.680
Oh, eight or five, six years ago.

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:06.680
I don't mean to, I do not mean to.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:07.680
The movie was Butter.

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:08.680
It was called Butter.

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.680
Oh yeah.

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.200
Oh, thank you.

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:16.360
I do not, I do not mean to diminish your role in your life, but I wonder if maybe she

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.360
just didn't remember.

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.360
Didn't give a shit.

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:21.360
Well, I think maybe she just didn't give a shit also, I bet like she had a lot of stuff

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.360
going on.

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:23.360
I think she was kind of busy.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.360
Yeah.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.360
She had a lot of things.

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:29.040
And then I have like that hard, that worried, you're right.

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.040
I know it's going to.

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.840
I probably did not register on her.

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:35.640
It's going to seem like we set this up, but what I wanted, I wanted the three of you to

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:38.400
do, I brought the scripts.

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:42.360
I wanted the three of you to do the controversial scene from Butter.

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.360
Oh shit.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.360
Oh shit.

01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.360
The fair, the Butter fair scene?

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:49.360
The director's cut, the director cut.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.360
Okay.

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.360
Okay, so.

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.360
Guys.

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.360
The campfire scene.

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.840
I finally finished it.

01:31:54.840 --> 01:32:00.840
This is my sculpture of a monopoly board made out of butter.

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:11.680
Listen, it's pretty hot out and it's bread.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.040
Time to get some bread in here.

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:21.400
I was going to say then bread fell from the sky.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:31.560
Yeah, and this is where you set this whole thing up.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:34.400
That's thunder.

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:40.120
You brought me here to an outside butter tournament to set up this monopoly board just to drop

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:47.160
bread from the ceiling in the middle of a thunderstorm typical romance.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.760
I don't know why they cut the scene.

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.760
I don't.

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.880
That seems like a great scene.

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.760
They cut that for time or what?

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.760
I guess it was.

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:55.760
Yeah.

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.760
The World Trade Center was in the background.

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.880
Yeah, it happened.

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:01.880
For no reason.

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.880
This movie came out around 9-11.

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:10.200
Cameron, have you ever been hired or asked to roast other people?

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:12.880
Not for 35 Gs.

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:19.080
No, I'm kind of smiley.

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.080
So I think people don't think I can do it.

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.080
Those people are wrong.

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:23.080
I'm so mean.

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.080
Guys, let's roast each other.

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:26.080
All right.

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:27.080
Oh, shit.

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:28.080
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Harmontown.

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.080
I don't like this.

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.080
Roast.

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.080
I don't like this.

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.080
I don't like this.

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.080
The Roastware.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:45.080
Suspenser is the Roastmaster General over here.

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.000
What is a Roastmaster General?

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Roastmaster General means you get to run the proceedings.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
All right.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Go.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Do you want to say who roasts whom?

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
No.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
All right.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Do you want to be the Roastmaster General?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
No, we haven't spoken to you for a while.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
You've been sitting over there.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
No, it's all good.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I don't have very much input on movies or comedy routines or famous people or experiences.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
With them, I just, you know, it's all good.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I just, if I had things to contribute, you know what?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
All right.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
All right.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Let's talk about Isis.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
There's only one thing you roast out.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Well, we've been really pulling together a new plot that I think is going to just surprise

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000
everybody.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
You're an Isis?

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
No.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Dole?

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Subscribe to Harmontown.com.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Live to see my dough face.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I can roast you guys.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
I can roast you guys so much.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
All right.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
We need a Roastmaster General that's going to bring people.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
You would be burned up.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
No, I want to be burned up.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
But when I'm going to roast you, you're going to get hot.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Get it.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000
You're going to get so crispy, your skin is going to get blistered.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Hey, Esposito, save your roasts for when the roast starts.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Lane, Lane.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I'm a scratch talking in advance.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Oh, you boys are not even going to know.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.000
When I start to talk, you are going to listen to me.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
All right, everybody.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Welcome to the first annual Harmontown Roast.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Where nobody's safe from being roasted at any moment.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
The Roaster can become the Roaster.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Wait, wait.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Is Jimmy Carran still here?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Let's sit.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I'm on the record.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
In a shorter chair.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Is Jimmy Carran still here?

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Yeah, in the center of the stage unless roast Jimmy Carran.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
But I know it.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
You're just trying to get out of being roasted.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Roaster.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Oh, no, you can roast me.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I just thought it'd be funny if it was the third party because it's how roasts work.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Let's bring out Jimmy Carran again to possibly get roasted.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Let's put it.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Oh, yeah.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Okay.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Yeah, you were doing great.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
You were doing great.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Okay.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
There we go.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Okay.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Okay.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Go ahead, Jeff.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Jeff, it's the Jimmy Carran roast.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
All right, Jimmy Carran.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Hello.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
I'm Jeff Davis here.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Your host.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
We got Jimmy Carran out here.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.000
He told a story about trying to commit suicide on a plane earlier.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000
You know, a lot of people would be Guantanamo for that.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
But I like Jimmy Carran.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Here's somebody who hates Jimmy Carran.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Cameron Esposito, everybody.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Oh, Jimmy Carran.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I've known you for years because we both spent time in Chicago.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000
What a city.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.000
It is full of food and you will eat it if you are hungry.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Just like everyone else.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000
You are so good at improv that you teach classes and you make people pay you.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
You very greedy man.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Oh, shit.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Cameron Esposito, everybody.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Cameron Esposito.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
You like these balls?

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
His name is Rob.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
His name is Dan Harmon.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I would have come here earlier, but Roseanne Barr's pussy had that horn in it.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Good job, Cameron Esposito.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Hey, your lesbian called the 90s once the back wants to get the lesbianism back.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
No, she's going, I kid Cameron Esposito.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I kid her because I'm opposed to her lifestyle.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:10.000
I'm not going to say Cameron Esposito is a lesbian, but when she goes out, she goes out with a woman.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:26.000
We are here to talk about the legend Jimmy Corraine, the man, the legend, the fucking horrible monster.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Folks, it's not fair.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
I know a lot of people say Jimmy Corraine is a piece of shit.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
He's a terrible person.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000
He should kill himself.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000
What else is going on?

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Oh, shit.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Let's bring out him.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
You know how to be hurt.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
You know him, you love him.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
He's the less famous Cordray.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Rob Corddry.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Oh, man.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Amy Schumer is not here.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
But she's a slut, right?

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
And then there's the other guys, the roastmaster general.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
He's fat.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000
And then there's all the guys that Dan mentioned.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000
And then Cameron's a lesbian.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000
And then Trubb is bald as fuck.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000
He doesn't even know he's been bald since he was 19.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:44.000
It's like, uh, fuck.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
And then, but then there's the guy, Jimmy.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:58.000
I really respect him because he's a guy that is sort of a luminary in the improv community.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Oh, shit.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
That was Rob Corddry, everybody.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Damn, damn.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I really need a rebuttal because I didn't realize

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
I was supposed to cover everyone.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Oh, shit.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Hang on, hang on.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Hang on.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I'm not saying Cameron Esposito doesn't understand roasts, but when she goes to TGI Fridays,

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:54.000
she orders the... You know what's better than this? Let's bring out Rob Schrab, everybody! Rob Schrab!

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I'm so sad all the time. Oh God, I stepped on a nail. My foot hurts. It hurts so bad.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Oh, it's... Y'all seem like really nice people. I don't understand the point of this. Oh, it's bleeding really bad right now.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:33.000
This nail, I stepped on a nail. I didn't see it was really dark backstage. It went right through my shoe.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Rob, Rob, Rob! Rob, Rob! It really hurts! I had to walk on it just to get the podium so far away from the edge of the stage.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Rob, are you supposed to make friend of Cameron? Or Jimmy or anybody else?

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
You could be taller, I guess.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
I just, I just...

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I...

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
I...

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Seriously, I...

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
You're not supposed to pull it out.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I heard you're not supposed to pull it out.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
It makes it bleed.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Bro, work the dais. Work the dais right there.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Oh, my God.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I'm losing a lot of blood here.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Oh, Cordray.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Oh, shit.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Oh, shit.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
A nice, nice shirt, I guess.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
It could be...

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
It actually is a nice shirt.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
It is. It's a bunch going on.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Yeah, it's great. Okay.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Dan, you smell like piss, and...

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Shit.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Oh, my God.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
This nail in my foot really hurt.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
It might be one of those, like,

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
drywall screws between...

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Oh, my God.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Call my wife.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Call my wife.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Please call my wife.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Let's hear it.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Somebody help me walk off stage.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Somebody help me walk off stage.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
It's only going to make it worse walking on stage.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Against normal roast protocol

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
for an early rebuttal, Cameron Esposito,

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
even though it's not her roast.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Yes, exactly.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Wow, the whole team now.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
You're lined up

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
and get ready for these things.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Spencer Crittenden, everybody.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Spencer Crittenden.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Spencer Crittenden. No hard feelings.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
No hard feelings.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Wait, where is he going?

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Sit the fuck down.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
He really liked the joke.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I will say when the roast is over.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
He loves the roast.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
I want a second rebuttal.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Second rebuttal.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Cameron Esposito, back for rebuttal number two, everybody.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
I should get a tourniquet or something.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Somebody turn his laugh mic off.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
My toes are turning purple.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
My toes are turning purple.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Dan, I'm not saying

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
that you didn't make Malcolm in the middle.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
But you made a whole other show

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
that was equally beloved.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
But by a different group of people

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
than that other show,

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
the two shows are for a different audience.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
And I think you are being too competitive.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
So I don't think you need to worry about it.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And it seems like you still have enough money

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
to live, so who cares?

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I think I'm getting a lock draw.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
That can't be good, right?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Somebody should sweep up back there.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Nails.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Cameron Esposito's rebuttal

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
number three.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
This is three of seven, Cameron.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Yeah, you got it.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Rob, I'm not saying that

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
you are particularly good

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
at Twitter, but everybody

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
made your name into a verb.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
So shut up.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Fuck you, Schrab.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Your name isn't even your name anymore.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
It's a whole other thing, and you did it

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
with your own success.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
So nice.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Look at Dan's face.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Look at the face dance I'm making right now.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
You look so mad.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
You look so mad.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Oh shit.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
It's a Jimmy Crane roast

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
for a moment, we're dead.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
We got some band-aids

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
who arrived Schrab right now.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
A little prop comedy, everybody.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
It's not a joke.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
It really hurts.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
It's probably sanitized.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Spencer Crittenden in a moment, one liner.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
You still got it.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
But seriously,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Jimmy, you're taking a lot of abuse tonight.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
It's only fair that we let you

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
we let you rebut.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Let's hear it for the man of the hour,

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Jimmy Crane, everyone.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Thank you.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
I have one more rebuttal.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Somebody call an ambulance.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Cameron Esposito!

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Well, okay, Rob Corddry,

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
you are next to me.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Get back, get further away,

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
because

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
you're going to be so sad

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
when you cry.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I don't want to see it, so

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
what I'm trying to say to you is

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
it's almost like

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
you are

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
smart enough to figure out how to

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
create a television show that is successful,

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
but you aren't even recognizable from it,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
so you can still go a bunch of places

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
and live a good life.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Which is an interesting

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
and cool business decision, you

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
dumb person.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
She's letting me have it right now.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
What people don't know is that

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
this rebuttal by her is actually

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
like ten minutes long.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
A musical sting going to save her from this one.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
This is a long piece.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
This all rebuttal?

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
I have been to...

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
I was kidding!

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Alright, come on.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
I want to go again.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
If everybody gets to go again,

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I want to go again.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Oh, boy.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Harmon, are you sure this is

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
a good idea?

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Let me go, I can do it.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
We can just...

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Dan, we can just end the show right here.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I was told the show would be over by

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
1939.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Everything's about the show,

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
but nothing's about the entertainment.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
If you don't let me roast

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
these people,

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
you're against entertainment.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
In my day,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
people roasted.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
They turned up the heat.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Johnny Carson

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
called Sammy Davis Jr. a faggot.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Sammy Davis

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
called Johnny Carson a homo.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Everybody be gay.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
It was fun.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Now it's become all about

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
the political correct.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I'll tell you what's correct.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Politically is gay.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Straight

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
B

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
values you

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
faggot.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Yeah, let's keep saying that.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Let's get it in again.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
It's good to see everybody up here.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
You're all queer.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Now I served

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
for three years in the

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
presidency under the

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Rosti's administration.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
That's the conceit of my bit.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
And there were two rules.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Be gay.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And whoop

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
whoop.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
It's always good to see Rob Schrab here.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Gay.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Yeah, yeah, end the show.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I'm really in a lot of pain.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Rob

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Korg is here.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Rob Schrab is really in a lot of pain.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
We should end this show.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
It's really fucked up right now.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
It's a nail right in the nerve.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
He's got a nail right through his foot.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Foot nerves.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
It's not a joke.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
No, it's not a joke.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Right in the palm.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
I will say it's a little apropos.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
It being Easter Sunday.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
No, not funny.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Thank you for coming to

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Hamilton, everybody.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
We're not going to follow

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
that shit with anything.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Let's hear

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Regina Corrine.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Rob Corddry.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
DeMorge Brown

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
is in the green room.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Bring DeMorge Brown out right now

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
until the show is over.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
DeMorge Brown.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
No, no.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Get out there pretty much.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Follow that shit, DeMorge.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
DeMorge, come on.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Roast it, everybody.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Roast it.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Alright, for the final word.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Jeff Davis.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
It's good to see you here.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Your Lady Elaine Fairchild called.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
She wants her whole fucking vibe back.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Whoa.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
No, no, no, no.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
No, no, no.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
No, no, no.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Zimmerang.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Zimmerang.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Cameron Esposito is here.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Pinkie Descadero called and she said,

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
hello.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
And on that,

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I'm going to say good night.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
We all got to go.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Let's hear it for Hammer Time, everybody.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Thank you, Hammer Time.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
DeMorge Brown, Rob Corddry, Rob Sharpe, Cameron,

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Jimmy Corraine, Spencer Crittenden

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
who didn't speak a whole lot,

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
but we love him just as much.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Your Mayor again, one more time.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Mr. Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.000
It was the roastiest of roasts.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Did you get any of that?

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:45.000
It's a good show.
