{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.000\nHello, everybody. Happy Mother's Day. Welcome to Harmontown.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:19.000\nHappy Sunday. Once again, Harmontown is in session.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:21.000\nI'm back. Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:33.000\nWelcome to the stage, the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Thank you. Happy Mother's Day.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:42.000\nNo more wire hangers, you guys. We watched Mommy Dearest today in bed. Aaron and I did.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:48.000\nWe weren't doing it thematically. We've been on this Joan Crawford kick and we just happened to be,\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:54.000\nwe were watching Mommy Dearest on Mother's Day, but it's a good one to watch on any day.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:59.000\nI think about that movie a lot, mostly because I want her bathroom from that first scene with all the shower nozzles.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:02.000\nI want a lot of that house. Yeah, that house was really good.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:08.000\nBut yeah, I was watching it and made me remember because that was like when I was a kid.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:13.000\nAnd I remember, you know, America was fascinated with that movie. My mom really liked that movie.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:20.000\nShe was into it. She quoted a lot. She'd joke like, no more wire hangers, like when she would find herself giving hysterical.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:26.000\nShe'd self-efface by saying stuff like that. But also, she would do so much from the movie.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:32.000\nAnd I was like, did she get the idea from the movie or did the movie maker feel better?\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:40.000\nI was like, oh, I didn't use a whole can of comic cleanser. I just wanted to clean the bathroom a little bit.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:46.000\nI don't know. Happy Mother's Day. I called my mom today, as you all did.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:48.000\nYeah, we did.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:50.000\nOr did you?\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:52.000\nAnybody not call their moms?\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:56.000\nSee, you weren't making the joke that Goldberg was making. He called out, yeah, we did.\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:58.000\nCalled my mom, get it? He fucked my mom.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nOh, okay.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\nWell, payback is fair, right?\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:04.000\nYeah, sure.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:06.000\nYou've been fucking everyone's mom for a long time now.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:15.000\nYeah. I called her, and great news, she loves Season 4 of Community. She loves it.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:21.000\nShe's very happy with it. She was quoting episodes. She's kind of...\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.000\nAnd then I said, yeah, we should come up and we should get together sometime.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nAnd she went, yeah, cool, cool, cool, cool. Oh, sorry, sorry.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:32.000\nAnd I just laughed about it. I was like, you're sorry about that?\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:39.000\nI don't understand. So it registers in your brain that that's an issue socially,\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:44.000\nbut you just cool, cool, cooled for 10 minutes about the thing.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:50.000\nAnd then I was on speakerphone because my dad was in the room, so then she did a classic Harmon move.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:55.000\nShe was like, what? Huh? What? I don't understand what you're saying.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:58.000\nAnd I was like, never mind. What was your question?\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:03.000\nShe was like, question. It's not an inquisition. And I was like, I'm sorry. What the fuck's going on?\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:06.000\nGod damn it, every year.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:08.000\nHave you watched Season 4? Do you watch it?\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:15.000\nNo, no, I haven't. I just, for selfish reasons and for altruistic reasons and just philosophical reasons,\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:20.000\nI still haven't watched it. It's on my Tivo. I kept the season pass.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:25.000\nSo every time we game of thrones night, like tonight, we go there and I see a little folder that says Community.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nAnd I go, huh? So it's like looking at Instagram, you know?\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nThere's your ex-girlfriend out there.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:40.000\nI picked that restaurant. I introduced her to that restaurant. I sewed that dress.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:46.000\nWeird relationship.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:55.000\nSo, that was going to be part of my segment called Things Dan Harmon's Not Allowed to Complain About, because they make him sound like a rich douche.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:59.000\nMy mom loved Season 4 community.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:05.000\nThe other items are, I have a Black Widow infestation in my backyard.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nYou're allowed to complain about that.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:12.000\nNot to people who don't have backyards.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:16.000\nNo, you've let them off the hook. Now they don't feel bad about not having a backyard.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:21.000\nYeah, guys, stay in your apartments. Backyards have Black Widows.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:26.000\nErin was in the backyard. She moved a ceramic pot or a rabbit or something,\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:38.000\nand a Black Widow spider from the movies crawled across her hand and she killed it and then found its egg sack inside the ceramic rabbit.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:44.000\nThey're all over our garage too. They're all up in our garage.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:47.000\nShe keeps telling me these stories about Black Widows crawling on her.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:53.000\nIt's like Christopher Walken and Deer Hunter. It's like, stop whatever you're doing. Knock it off.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:57.000\nStop putting your hands under ceramic items.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:04.000\nThis is building a tree stump in Flash Gordon in our front yard so she can just put scorpions in and reach into it every day.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:09.000\nIf I have a golf ball that goes slightly into a bush, I get the longest club in the bag.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:16.000\nUnless you live anywhere with snow on the trees, don't touch a bush.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:22.000\nI came to California with that knowledge, just from time-life books about spiders.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:30.000\nI was a big spider guy. When I was a kid, I loved spiders. I would go out behind the garage in Wisconsin and I would play with bugs.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:37.000\nI was fascinated with them. I probably would have been an entomologist or something or an arachnidotopia.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:42.000\nI would just play with spiders and bugs and stuff.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:53.000\nSo much so that one of my aunts for Christmas gave me this big colorful book for adults about spiders because there was something I was really into.\n\n05:53.000 --> 06:00.000\nI read the book. It was just a scientific book about the world's most poisonous spiders.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:16.000\nI remember reading descriptions of the Black Widow. It remains relatively still, but it also has a lot of...\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:29.000\nBut its reflexes are so fast that it can traverse the length of a broomstick and a human arm faster than the human ability to drop the stick or something like that.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:40.000\nPurposely using measurements to terrify you. It will be in your ear eating your brain before you can say there's a spider in my ear eating my brain.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:46.000\nI have a pretty live and live policy with bugs and stuff like that. I don't like ants. No one wants a bunch of ants in their place.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:52.000\nIf I see one ant, that's the scout ant, so I do that. I whack that ant so I make sure that he doesn't go back and tell the tale about it.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:55.000\nYou put his head on a microscopic pike.\n\n06:55.000 --> 07:00.000\nI have a little tiny curb and I kick his teeth in.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:06.000\nI always kill one when there's another one watching and then I look at the other one and I say...\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:10.000\nIt doesn't work. I've tried to tell your friends that it doesn't work.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:14.000\nThey do tell their friends and they go, oh, the breadcrumb is still there?\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nSo now Kevin's dead, so if nothing else, we can eat Kevin.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:21.000\nBecause they're insects.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nOr we can go team up on that asshole that killed Kevin.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nIn their dreams.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:33.000\nSpiders, no. I told you a story about me falling asleep one time. I was 24, I had a girlfriend and I was staying at her place.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:40.000\nWe were asleep naked and I woke up and there was a sound of what I thought was a moth had gone into my ear.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:46.000\nI was laying on my left side and something that sounded like a one-man band was in my brain.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:53.000\nI jump up naked and I'm running around the room screaming. She's laughing because she looks hilarious.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nBut I hear...\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:59.000\nIt's that loud and it's freaking out.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:03.000\nAnd I'm trying to hit my head and get it out and I'm punching myself in the ear.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:08.000\nAnd she's like, what are you doing? It was a moth, it was a flyer, bugs in my ear.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:14.000\nAnd it was so loud and it was non-stop beating on my, like flapping on my eardrum.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:21.000\nAnd I start, I punch myself in the head as hard as I can, dazing myself and the bug.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nAnd then I hear...\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:27.000\nWhich I think was his heart.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:31.000\nI just dazed it and stunned it for a while and then it starts going again.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:36.000\nAnd every time I try to, she turns a light on but I have to turn my head up to the light\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:40.000\nwhich makes the feeling of gravity is going to bring it farther into my brain.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:45.000\nAnd I don't want to do that so I'm trying to get water out of your ear and that's not working.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:50.000\nSo I've been told later on that if that happens, if a bug goes in your ear, pour alcohol in there.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:55.000\nLike, knock it out, get it drunk, fuck it up and then at least the insanity will stop.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:59.000\nBut I'm just losing my mind and punching myself and she takes some twitters out and tries to get it\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:04.000\nand it long lasts and it takes a long time, we're both nude in the bathroom, in the middle of the night.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:08.000\nAnd she's like, we'll get you to a hospital, like I'll be insane by the time we get to the hospital.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:14.000\nI seriously will lose my mind, it was freaking me out and the noise was so loud and now it's scrambling\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nand I feel the sensation of it burrowing in.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nIt's going the wrong way.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nIt's not going to go the way that I was punching.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:30.000\nIt's like, it descended from hundreds of generations of spiders that survived humanity.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nThere's just a crazy giant outside, it's not going to go that way.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nIt knows exactly when to stay put.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:40.000\nSo she gets my head up this way to the light so the air is pointing up and she puts the tweezers down my ear\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:46.000\nand manages to get halfway into my brain and pulls out a spider the size of a nickel.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:51.000\nAnd worth every penny.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:56.000\nThat's been our show, goodnight everybody.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:04.000\nAnd it flies out and we both scream because it's quite alive and it's pretty scary looking\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:11.000\nand it hits the ground running and so I barefoot just go wham and stamp on it with a size 13 and a half barefoot foot\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:20.000\nand I lift up my foot and it goes whew, it just shrugs it off and gets up and kicks it off.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:23.000\nThere are days and there are days.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nI can't get a break around here.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:29.000\nLike I wanted to be in your ear.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nIt looked like a barn.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:36.000\nSo it just fell down my ear and they say that we eat lots of bugs in our sleep and don't know it\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:40.000\nbut I finally managed to kill it and then for the rest of the time we dated which wasn't long\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:43.000\nshe kept putting fake spiders in the bed.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nWhat?\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:53.000\nYeah just to be honest I believe the word is asshole and it's the worst so now like I used to sleep with a capillow on my head\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nand stuff and it's terrible.\n\n10:55.000 --> 11:01.000\nAlright so now, sleep tight everybody.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:05.000\nAlright my mom loves season 4.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nWe're infested with Black Widows.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nWe're going to have a guy come take care of it.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:13.000\nI sound like an asshole because you guys couldn't have a guy come take care of it.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nI'm going to call the Black Widow guy.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nI don't know who he is.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:21.000\nHarvey Keitel is going to pull up in a Ferrari.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:25.000\nMy animated show is going to take till December for you guys to get to see.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nI'm very excited.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:30.000\nThat's another thing I'm complaining about.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:34.000\nPeople keep spreading rumors about me going back to season 5 of the community.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:37.000\nI'm complaining about that.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nThat navigation system in my Prius.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nI keep dropping blue flags everywhere.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\nThat's the worst.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nYeah.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:49.000\n5% of the audience, who's got this goddamn navigation system?\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:50.000\nFucking blue flags.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nI keep dropping blue flags.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nAnybody with a Toyota or a Lexus I think.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:59.000\nEvery intersection here can fucking drop a blue flag at random spots.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nI got blue flags all over the city.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nThere's a menu you can delete the blue flags.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nI know but you're never going to do that are you?\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:10.000\nYou're always on your way somewhere and you're dropping these blue turds all over.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:14.000\nPrecisely when you're trying to do the opposite, which is figure out where you're going and\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nyou're putting flags all over the thing.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:20.000\nOkay, I'm going to go home from work now.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nAre you sure you don't want to go to one of these blue flags?\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nYou like so much?\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nGo to Ivar.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nYou loved it.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nYou put a blue flag there.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nNo.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nNicole.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:32.000\nI call my car Nicole.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nI'm not going, I'm just saying the call Kidman thing?\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nIs that one?\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:37.000\nYeah, probably.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nI don't know.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\nI don't name my car.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:42.000\nI have better things to do.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:45.000\nI can't even name characters I create.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nThe community has all my friends names.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:57.000\nSo that rumor on Deadline, I think the reason for it is because weeks ago Sony reached out\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:03.000\nthrough private channels, not that they would have ever reached out through honest public\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nones.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:11.000\nThe way that big studios work is that they're in the business of getting their shows syndicated\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:18.000\nand I think that in the days before they were sure that community would get that very important\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:23.000\nnext 13 episodes, which to them that's all it represents is just the number 13.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.000\nThey don't care if any of those 13 are good or bad.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:31.000\nThey just needed those 13 so that they could not get fired by the machines that make the\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nmoney from the 97 episodes.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nIt'll be very lucrative for me as well.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:38.000\nWe're all very happy.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:42.000\nEveryone except the people that never made any money and who got tattoos of Abbott on\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\ntheir thigh.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:47.000\nWe're all thrilled to pieces about this episode order.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:52.000\nBut back before it happened, when they were in the position of what can we do to make\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:58.000\nsure this happens, in their misguided bottom line minds we're thinking, let's sweeten the\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nkitty.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:03.000\nMaybe we could tell NBC, Dan will come back and that way there will be all kinds of press\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nand that's how little they care.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nThat's how little shame they have.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:08.000\nThey don't care.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:13.000\nTo them that wouldn't be winning or losing, they don't care.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:18.000\nI think that in the ensuing weeks, during which time NBC finally made a decision to pick up\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:24.000\nthe show so it doesn't matter, someone's assistant probably told someone's assistant and someone's\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:31.000\nfriend over drinks that that conversation happened for a second and resulted in maybe a\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:34.000\ndeadline article which resulted in a bunch of other press about it.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nSo you're going back?\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nTuesday.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:44.000\nNo, my point is I don't think it's a question that I would even have a yes or no answer to.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:47.000\nI don't think that is a choice that I have.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nI haven't read this article.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:51.000\nFor all I know you're perpetuating this myth right now.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nI probably am.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:56.000\nI'm trying to make Harmontown a thing you should come to and listen to, I guess.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nI'm participating.\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nWhere's my clicks?\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:02.000\nWait, but Chevy's not in the show anymore.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nWe've got to get him here.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:05.000\nWell, he's a...\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:06.000\nWhy?\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:10.000\nBecause it'll be insane.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:13.000\nWhy not bring Chevy Chase once to Harmontown?\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nDid you see him on SNL?\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:16.000\nNo.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:19.000\nDo you understand what happens when he walks into a room?\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:20.000\nEverything gets complicated.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:23.000\nI'm not saying it's going to be fun.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nI'm just saying that we all muscle up.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nIt's like going to play paintball.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nIt hurts.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nIt's sweaty.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nYou get bruised.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nI just don't see it the way you see it.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nI call him.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:39.000\nHe calls me sometimes.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:45.000\nThe concept is funny on paper, but...\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nCan we Skype him?\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:50.000\nCan we get a screen up and do a little via satellite thing?\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:55.000\nYeah, he seems pretty tech-savvy.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:58.000\nHe's probably Skyping me right now.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nI can't figure out how to filter it right.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nHe can.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:08.000\nHe does a lot of PHP programming in his spare time.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:12.000\nAnyways, I just wanted to address that because people tweet me.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:18.000\nAnd I thought maybe that would be fun, worth your $10 alone to come out and hear me say out loud.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:21.000\nAlright, so I think that ends the...\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nI had stuff to talk about segment.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nI saw an Arrested Development poster outside Meltdown.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nI got really excited.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:33.000\nIt was cool for me.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:39.000\nIt might be a little cameo in one of those episodes by a certain fat alcoholic.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nClose to your hearts.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:45.000\nAnd may or may not have gone out and visited that set.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:54.000\nI also had to edit out the whole for anyone that was here when I described me being on the set of a Terrence Malick movie with...\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nWhat's his name? Batman in it?\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nJohn Landis.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nChristian Bale.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nDid you know John Landis is the new Batman?\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nI was very surprised.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:08.000\nIt's weird, but they're going back to a kind of classic feel.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:13.000\nI told the story about going and being on the set of a Terrence Malick movie with Christian Bale,\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:18.000\nand then I had to edit the whole thing out for the very specific reason that, as Aaron pointed out to me on the way home,\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nI got to...\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:24.000\nIt's okay for me to say that I got to do that and how cool it was.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:29.000\nIt's not okay for me to reveal absolutely anything about the film itself,\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:34.000\nwhich I did in the process of talking about the movie, so I lifted the whole thing out.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:41.000\nThe only thing that's left is that I get to say, I did this thing and who cares?\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nIt's like hearing someone talk about a slot machine in Vegas.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:46.000\nIt's amazing, I was up and then I was down.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:51.000\nThey'll fuck yourself, who cares?\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:54.000\nWhen people tell you about their Dungeons & Dragons characters,\n\n17:54.000 --> 18:01.000\nhe was a level five mage and he had an eyepatch and a hawk on his dick.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\nIt's make-believe.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nWhile you were gone, Bill poisoned us.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nHello Bill, I just heard that, it's hilarious.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nBill, were you also the guy we were talking about?\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:14.000\nWhere are my cookies?\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:17.000\nOr did those get destroyed in the bonfire you had afterwards?\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nI don't know, maybe they're back stage.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:24.000\nI would have been the only one that lived had everybody died from the beef jerky.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:28.000\nBill, settle a bet.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:32.000\nSpencer said you were the benign deviant guy.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nYes.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:44.000\nSo Bill wasn't a stranger bearing meat, he was our old friend.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nDid you call up the supplier or was that neglected on your part?\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nDid you just leave it out too long?\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:52.000\nI did wait it too long because I had to miss a show.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nAh, he's blaming us now.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nNo, it was me.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nYou had to miss a show.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nWell, we all made it.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nIt was very funny.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nWhat was your emotional takeaway from all that?\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:10.000\nIt was kind of a roller coaster of whether or not you were a good person or a bad person.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:15.000\nIn the moment, I sort of shut down.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:23.000\nIn the moment, I sort of shut down, but then when I heard everybody applauding in the podcast,\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:26.000\nwhen I listened to it later, I finally felt like I could forgive myself.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:31.000\nI heard everybody go, yeah, but I could not hear that.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nOh, really? That's interesting.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:37.000\nThat happens. I think that's some kind of weird...\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nWhen I'm on stage, I often...\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:45.000\nActually, less now than never, but I've already...\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:50.000\nWorrying about what other people think causes it kind of weird.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:55.000\nThe same thing is when you're running a marathon and those drugs flood your body\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:59.000\nthat don't let you know that your muscles are shredded and that you're in pain and stuff.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:02.000\nIt makes you kind of deaf and insensitive to things,\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.000\nso you're kind of in your own little bottle in your head, I think.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nThat's what happened to you.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nOr it was the fungus.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nYou may have poisoned yourself.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:14.000\nI was worried that the fungus took over my brain and made me bring it.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:20.000\nAfter the show, I crawl up on the fire escape to get as close as possible to the sun\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:26.000\nand then just a leaf comes out of my head.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:29.000\nThat is the coolest fungus of all,\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.000\nthe one that makes ants' brains go crazy and makes them climb a tree.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:38.000\nThat's the thing that's terrifying about that is this,\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:41.000\nthat there was a day before that fungus existed\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:45.000\nand then there was a day, it was Wednesday of maybe 6,000 BC, we don't know.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:53.000\nBut that fungus, from the ants' perspective, Wednesday was fine\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:58.000\nand then Thursday, Nathaniel was going like,\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:02.000\nand then because it was, I don't know.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nI'm sure there was lots of trial and error in the fungus' part.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:07.000\nThere was lots of fungus in the ants' brains.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:11.000\nThey would get in the brain and fuck them up and then that fungus didn't survive,\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:14.000\nbut the fungus that specifically...\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:17.000\nIt got in there and learned how to vulture on the ants' brains,\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:20.000\ndrive them up the tree, like make his legs move.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nIt's really crazy.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nI don't know, Jeff.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nI think that's too complicated for random mutation.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:29.000\nI'm converting to intelligent design.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:33.000\nMe and Ben Stein are going to go on a retreat.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nI've had it.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:39.000\nHi, ball. It is complex.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:43.000\nI give up. No more science.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:48.000\nThat human eye, who would do that?\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nI mean, who wouldn't?\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nWhat random system would do that?\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nThat's the intelligent design main argument.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nLook at the human eye.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nBen Stein's into that now?\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nI think he is.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:04.000\nI saw a trailer for a documentary\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:08.000\nthat played a lot of punk rock music or something while he walked around,\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:15.000\nand I think the implication was that he was doing a religious thing,\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:19.000\nbut saying God existed.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nWho cares?\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nOn either side, who cares?\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nThe only thing more obnoxious than somebody beating down doors\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:30.000\nand insisting God exists is somebody insisting he doesn't.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.000\nIt's so dumb, such a dumb argument.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nWho cares?\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nI saw Bill Maher, it's like, believe what you want,\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nbut he's just being a dick about it.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nAlmost you would say evangelical.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nI just can't stand.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nAnd dogmatic, and being a fundamentalist,\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nand being just a tool.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:50.000\nHe's knocking on my door and thumping a book\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:54.000\ncalled Not the Bible.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nAlso, he just seems like a terrible guy anyway.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:59.000\nIf you've nailed a way of life,\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:02.000\nadvertise for it with a big smile on your face and hanging out.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:05.000\nAnd then let me go, God damn it, I love that guy.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nHow can I be more like him?\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nLet me sneak into your underwear drawer,\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:11.000\nfind your Bible, and because I need to know\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nhow to be as happy as you.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nWalk around scowling.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:18.000\nI don't want to know what you put in your drink at night.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:21.000\nI got my own problems.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:26.000\nThe problem is that everybody thinks that\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:30.000\neveryone's codependent, everyone insists that only if and when\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:33.000\neveryone in the world does exactly the same thing\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nwill all our problems be solved.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:39.000\nAnd so people justify simultaneously being completely unhappy\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:42.000\nand being totally passionate about some point of view.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:45.000\nWhich if everyone just would, you know,\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:48.000\nyou gotta tend your own garden,\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nbecause that way you're not,\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\npeople could just counter your argument by going,\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nwell then why are you such a miserable sack?\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nAnd I think that's why people are into politics.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nIt's not really because they care that much.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nIt's because it justifies being a miserable\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nand evangelical piece of shit,\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nsimultaneously without being a hypocrite.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:07.000\nI think the appeal of politics is that you can pretend\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nthat your point of view is important,\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\neven though it clearly isn't to you.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nIt's like in the electrical acid test,\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:15.000\nand Ken Keezy is asked to speak,\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.000\nlike is it Berkeley or whatever,\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nand all the kids are like, you know,\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\nlike let's change everything, change everything.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:23.000\nAnd he's the voice of that, you know,\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nthat time and that movement they think.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:26.000\nAnd he gets up and he's like,\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nyeah, it just kind of seems like you're all just yelling,\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nme, me, me.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nLike it's all about just I.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nIt's like it's all just you just saying your name out loud.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nDidn't Abbie Hoffman,\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nAbbie Hoffman gave a big speech\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nat some point in the 60s, you know,\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:39.000\nwhen everybody was goofing around.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.000\nAbbie Hoffman did a thing where he got up and like,\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nhe said this whole speech,\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:45.000\nand everybody was cheering for it,\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nand he's like, I can tell you guys love this speech,\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nbut I gotta, I feel bad taking credit for it.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:52.000\nIt was actually written by Adolf Hitler.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:55.000\nIn 1935, I just gave you a speech\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:58.000\nfrom Hitler.\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:59.000\nDid he change it?\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:00.000\nDid he change some words?\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:03.000\nI'm sure he translated it into English.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nBut I'm sure it was,\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nbut I bet he didn't have to change that much\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nbecause it was probably just general.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:10.000\nI mean, every time Hitler spoke,\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:13.000\nhe didn't say let's kill six million Jews.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nOtherwise, that would be, you know,\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nthat roulette wheel would have come up double zero\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nat a certain point.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:21.000\nSo it would be like, six minutes, come on.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:24.000\nI got work tomorrow.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:28.000\nMost of the time, he was saying very similar stuff\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nto every politician you've ever heard in your life,\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nwhich is we're so fucking amazing.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:34.000\nWe're gonna be amazing from now on.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:35.000\nWe haven't been amazing in the past,\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nbut now we're gonna be really amazing tomorrow,\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:38.000\nand it's gonna be because we're strong\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nand we're together.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:42.000\nAnd words that mean absolutely nothing\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nin a world where we then team up\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:47.000\non specific words like retarded and the n-word\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nand go, okay, let's get rid of these words\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nbecause these things are like abracadabra.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nIf I say retarded enough in the wrong way,\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:57.000\nthe retarded people are gonna be even more retarded.\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:00.000\nIf we eliminate the word, retardation will go away.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:03.000\nNot that it should because they're amazing people,\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:08.000\nand it's language that's the real handicap.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:12.000\nMeanwhile, people who say words that have no meaning at all\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nare actually actively oppressing people\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:21.000\nand causing things that result in people being physically hurt,\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:24.000\nand they get away with it because their words are porridge\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\ninstead of having any flavor.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nPorridge can be good, I'm not saying.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:31.000\nPorridge shouldn't be synonymous with lack of flavor.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nIt gets a bum rap because famous porridge\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:37.000\nis from Oliver Twist and the classic teddy bear story.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nThey make bad porridge famous.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nBad porridge is, yeah, bad porridge\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nis a higher profile than good porridge.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nThere's not enough...\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:50.000\nWe need to start an anti-porridge defamation league\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:53.000\nfor some kind that can...\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:56.000\nWhere are the stories where Jack climbs a beanstalk\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nand he finds golden porridge?\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nWhat qualifies something as porridge?\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nI think it has to...\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nCan someone look that up over here\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nand tell me what makes porridge porridge\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:10.000\nand not just a nice bowl of cream of wheat\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nor grits or something like that?\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:15.000\nIsn't porridge just warm breakfast cereal,\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nlike oatmeal, cream of wheat, grits?\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:20.000\nThe way pudding is just dessert in England,\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nlike pudding just means dessert, basically.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nNo, pudding is lots of things.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nIt's also like savory things.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nYou can get a pudding at any meal of the day there.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nSo maybe porridge is just like a bowl of hot...\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:33.000\nBoiling, ground, crushed or chopped cereal\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:36.000\nin water, milk or boats.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nThat's a lot of ores.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nWe have optional flavors.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nYeah, so it's grits.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nIt's bad cereal.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:48.000\nBoiled or poached, cereal, wheat, grain\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:52.000\nor human had served or not served\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:55.000\nin a bowl or on a platform for breakfast\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:59.000\nor to send a message to the enemy.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nOr anything in between.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nNow then, what makes gruel gruel?\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:06.000\nIs gruel just the world's worst porridge?\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nYeah.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:13.000\nYeah, gruel's worse than bad porridge.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:18.000\nOn the Homeland Security porridge color-coded scale.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nWe can formulate the world's most culturally biased\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nSAT question out of this.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:25.000\nPorridge is to gruel as gruel is to...\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nAll right, well, let's...\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:30.000\nI don't have shit to talk about.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nLet's get the stars on stage.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:35.000\nYeah, season five in your dreams with me.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nThey haven't asked.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:40.000\nIf they asked you, and let's say they gave you\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:43.000\nthe keys to the kingdom. I am a professional storyteller\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nand that's an amazing third act.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nSo, yeah, I would definitely...\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:50.000\nI would not be closed to that amazing story.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nYou bummed out they haven't...\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nI mean, I'm not going to ask you.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nNo, Tessie, this is the thing.\n\n28:56.000 --> 29:00.000\nThis is the reason I refuse to be bummed out they haven't asked.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nGod, that's not fair.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:07.000\nI get to be happy they haven't asked.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nThat is my luxury.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:12.000\nThat is why when Sony reached out to my agency and said,\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nmy response to my agent was like,\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:18.000\nwhen you guys figure out a yes or no question to ask me\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:21.000\nall together as one collection of suits,\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:24.000\nI will then have a question to answer.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nI'll be goddamned if I'm going to fall.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:29.000\nI was a nerd in high school. I know how this shit works.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:32.000\nI was supposed to go like, yeah, I'd go back\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:35.000\nand then get an email from Bob Greenback going,\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nI heard you'd said you'd come back.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:40.000\nUh-uh, bitch.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nI don't know who you think you are,\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nbut the voice is doing real good.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nWe don't need your ass.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nAnd I went, what the fuck did I do?\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nI just jumped twice.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:53.000\nI don't even like you people.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nI'm happy in forensics.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:59.000\nYou can take your cafeteria table and stick it up your ass.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:02.000\nAll you guys do is sit there and talk about how thin you are.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:05.000\nI have friends in the drama club,\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nwe're close.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:10.000\nWe've got a rocky horror together.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:13.000\nI have meaningful relationships.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:16.000\nI don't care how popular you are.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:19.000\nI do a little bit. It was fun.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:23.000\nDo you still retain popularity\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:26.000\nbecause you are still attached to that show,\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:29.000\nbut do you miss the kind of day-to-day popularity of like...\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nI miss the day-to-day like actual substance\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:37.000\ninstead of the kind of day-to-day like talking about,\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:42.000\nyou know, I miss the actual like short-term\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nlet's put on a show every week.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nHow did you feel about that?\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nHere's your reaction, you know,\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:51.000\nthe building and building and building\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nof that drum circle of fans.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:56.000\nThat beast getting fed\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:59.000\nand then responding to it with creations of their own.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nI'm not blowing smoke.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:04.000\nI'm blowing the actual content and the creation of it\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:07.000\nand the response to it and that fire burning.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:10.000\nI don't miss the byproduct of it,\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:13.000\nwhich was like people talking about me,\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nwhich inevitably would always result in people saying\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:18.000\nI was fat or psycho or something like that.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:21.000\nYou get ash with that ember.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nBut what I miss is the fire.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nWhat a metaphor. Go fuck yourself.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nHave another drink.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:32.000\nJoe Crawford eyebrow painting,\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:35.000\ncream-faced, no-wire hanger lovin'.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:40.000\nNo-wire hanger lovin'.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:43.000\nYou no-wire hanger lovin', bitch!\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nThere was just one black guy in that movie\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nto stand up and really give it to her.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:51.000\nYou don't hate wire hangers. You love the absence of wire hangers.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nThere's so many times in that movie\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nwhere the daughter pauses outside the house\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nbefore going back in one more time\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nor convent academy or whatever.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nI actually just realized that you needed\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\none black guy in the front row to go,\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\ndon't go in there!\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nStop it! She keeps hitting you!\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nI'm almost certain no black person\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\never saw a mommy dirty.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nIf they did, they'd probably be so confused.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nEveryone knows black people are\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nsynonymous with\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nan experience in life\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nand a set of perceptions.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nThey're completely objectified.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nSubset of humanity. We all know that.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nAll right.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nI'm being sarcastic.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nYour silence disturbs me sometimes.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nI got the message from the survey last week.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nHalf of you think I'm racist\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nand a majority of you are the juries out.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nI want to talk a little bit about\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nwhat I listened to while I was away,\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nso we should probably get Spencer and Camille up here.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nCan we get Spencer, Brendan\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:55.000\nand Kumail Nanjiani to the stage?\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nBy the way, you know the headline\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\non Deadline Tomorrow is going to be\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nDan Harmon expresses strong desire to return.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nI don't feel sorry for myself for a second\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nat all, obviously.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nI have lots of money\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nand I'm an amazing person\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nand I'm going to live till\n\n33:17.000

American dream.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nAnd a huge tapestry\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nmade out of dead Black Widows.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nJust little tiny Black Widow heads\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nlike a big game hunter and little\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nlittle mahogany crests.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nI'll have an Australian\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nassistant who really kind of bagged them all for me.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nI like Roosevelt.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nI go out with a monocle and an elephant gun.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nThat one there.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nHe could run across a broomstick\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nand cross your arm faster than you could react.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nNot anymore, he can't.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nHe was about cheater speed.\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nHe's obviously the guy\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nthat's really behind all the kills\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nbut I'm like, oh, that one there.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nThat was an eight legged.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nI think there were mostly eight legged.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nYou would be the kind of guy\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nwho would never be invited back to the...\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nYou would end up in a mysterious\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nshooting accident on my yacht.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nAll the Black Widow heads in my head also.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nAre they super...\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nTo bring together two things,\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nspiders and religion in Islam,\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nat least my sect of Islam,\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nat some point in history, there was a spider\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nand the good guy was hiding from the bad guys\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nand the spider made a web to hide\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nthe bad guy.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nSo in my sect of Islam,\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nspiders, you can't kill them.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nThey're all over the place.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nIt's not religious\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nsociety but it's bad luck to kill a spider.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nOh, is that right?\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nIt's interesting that it gets\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nall turned around like that.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nSo we had spider webs.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nI don't think it's bad luck to step on\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\na brown recluse or something like that.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nCalifornia, I've noticed\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nthere's a lot less mention of how much\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nbad luck it is to

35:11.000\nThose are arthropods.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nAll right, sometimes\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nI don't know how I can get up in the morning.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nIt's not how you

pierce the human skin\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nwith its handables.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nSo you let a daddy long leg\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\ncrawl on your hand and nothing's ever going to happen.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nBecause it's like the brontosaurus\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nof spider looking things.\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nIt's like a ridiculous...\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nIt maybe would eat an ant leg\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nif it found one in the mail.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nWell, you know,\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:06.000\nif it had the right address on

36:30.000\nIt's like Bobby and John Kennedy.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nBecause you got the brachiosaurus,\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nwhich is when it looks like it,\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nand

more.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nSo the one guy started putting together\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\ndifferent heads and bodies\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nof different species.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nJust for the street grab?\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nAnd he totally won,\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nand the other guy got totally discredited.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nAnd then after the winner died,\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nthey found out that he made up all these dinosaurs,\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nincluding the brontosaurus.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nBut as far as the

49:16.000\nand then he got killed for it\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nthis guy said stuff shit\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nall over the globe it was happening\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nroughly at the same time\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nas we were becoming\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\npowerful enough to kill each other\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nwe weren't taking each other seriously enough\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nwe have it within us\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nunconsciously\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\nas we start to get more and more crowded together\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nand the guns start to grow\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\non trees and be available\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nin bubblegum machines\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nin us to do stuff with our brains\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nthat will make it possible\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nfor guns to be available in gum ball machines\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nand nobody to get hurt\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nless people than you'd think\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nfor the lights to go out in New York for a whole night\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nand nobody gets hurt the ice cream just melts\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nand they eat it together\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nfor wonderful things to happen\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nno matter how little opinion we give\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nwe have of ourselves\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nwe've achieved\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nmagnificent things\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nboth because science continues\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nto prove maniacs wrong\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nbut also because\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nas that happens human beings\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\ncontinue to reveal themselves\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nto have the power to police themselves\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nthe monster inside of us\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nand\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nwhen the guys in the lab coats\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:26.000\ncome out and they go\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:28.000\nokay I just figured it out\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:30.000\nwhat happened\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\n0.00003 seconds\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nafter the universe was created\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nwe now know\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nthat a Zedron made of Hebron\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:43.000\nthat guy\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nhis job is to focus on that stuff\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:46.000\nreally hard\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nto the exclusion probably\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nhave a lot of thought about whether or not\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nwe should hit each other in the face\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\nover a game of checkers\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nthat guy might be a great person\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nhe might be a terrible person\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\npersonality wise\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nhis brain is given over to\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nforging into that unknown territory\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nand reporting back to us\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nwhat happens to a Parsec when it becomes a Quibon\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:10.000\nor whatever\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:12.000\nwe in the mainstream\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nsmart or stupid\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:16.000\nrelative to that guy\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:18.000\nwhen we hear that a Quizon is actually a Hebon\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nwe\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nwe\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nwe have to\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nwe have to be good people still\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nbecause the more\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nwe get rid of God\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nthe more we shove that stuff aside\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nthe more we actually\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nneed to supplant it with some kind of\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:37.000\ncode\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nsome kind of culture\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:41.000\nit's already been laid out for us\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nRoddenberry that's why he was so\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nimpacting because he saw it\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nand he saw\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nthe Vulcan mythology\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\nwhere they were related to Romulans\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nand they became like\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nsuper intelligent\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nand able to destroy themselves and made a memetic decision\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:58.000\nto evolve\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:00.000\nso we got to go with logic now\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nand logic says don't punch someone in the face\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\njust because\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nyou think he likes your girlfriend\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nor because you want more oil\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nor logic\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nmake a decision about the species\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nand blah blah blah\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nwe know that science is supposed to be\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nget this higher state of being\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nbut right now we're caught in this puberty\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nwhere science is only making us beat up our dad\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\non prom night\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nwe're just being a little bit destructive I think\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nwe have to work it out a little bit\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\ndon't you think there's like a churchification\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nof science going on though\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nbecause like I feel that there's\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:36.000\nthat's what I'm worried about\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nthat's happening like that's the thing\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nand look this paleontologist was doing\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nthe choir boy molestation\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nof creating dinosaurs\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nhe was making them up\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nI would say not as bad but continue\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nit happens like there's people\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nthat won't listen to evidence\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nbecause they just assume\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nlike assume that a\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\ngiven principle is just law\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nand unchangeable and rather than like\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\ngo back and look at evidence\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nthey're like no this is what I know\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nthis is my bible so I'm not going to question it\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\nbut that's the whole point of science\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\nthere's a ton of oh yeah within their ranks\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nthank god science is intelligent enough\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nto have as its code\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nhas peer review\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nand skepticism like baked into it\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nthere are these dogmatic\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nold men who make it hard on the young men\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\ncoming up young young women\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nwho\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nit's too late for me\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nmake your own lightsaber and move on\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nthrow me in the pit\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nand watch me shoot lightning as I die\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:36.000\nbut\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\nthere's always going to be an old boys club\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nthat's always like even\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nespecially anthropology where it's like\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:44.000\nyou have to dig up a bone\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nto prove something and then in the meantime\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nit's all these theories and like Elaine Morgan\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\none of my heroes who created the aquatic ape\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\ntheory was like bullied by\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nblah blah blah a different episode\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nthe uh\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nbut take a step back from that now\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nif you're willing to look at that and say\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nokay scientist A\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nis kind of a dick to scientist C\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nwithin\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\ntheir community because scientist C\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\nhasn't paid his dues and\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nyou know this theory's got traction\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nand people don't want it to be true and don't want to take\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nnew hypotheses seriously\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nnow you take a step back from that\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nand look at how science\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nis that condescending\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nto someone with an IQ over\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\n75 who happens to\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nchoose to have a relationship\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nwith the unknown an umbilical\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:32.000\npoint coming out of their forebrain\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nand into the into the void\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nto comfort them\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nin the face of all this chaos\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nto personify\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:42.000\nas is not only our right but\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nfuck our instinct\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nas these chatterbox primates\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nwe creating religion\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.000\ncomes as naturally to us\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:52.000\nas I've said pooping\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nand there's a lot of poop that needs to be\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nflushed away but thank god we look\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:58.000\nat it sometimes\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:00.000\nin case there's blood in it and we go to the doctor\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:02.000\nit's coming\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.000\nout of us religion is coming\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.000\nout of us and you just take a look\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:08.000\nat it every time you blow your nose\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:10.000\nare you saying religion is like bloody poop\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.000\nthere's blood in this shit\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:14.000\nbad religion there might also\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:16.000\nalso once in a while be\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:18.000\na nugget of gold in your poop\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nnot as often\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nmaybe the metaphor doesn't work\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:24.000\nhuman beings create a lot of\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:26.000\nthings that are easily dismissible\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:28.000\nbecause they happen so naturally\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nthe fact that I'm talking I mean\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:32.000\nit's amazing people like\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:34.000\nwe've written language written languages\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.000\nit's a medic thing it's like babies just at two years\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nold just go hey give me a glass of water\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nwhoa what the fuck\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:42.000\nthat's genetic that's\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.000\nlike an actual happening\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nlike we're like weird macaws\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:48.000\nwe just start talking it's crazy\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:50.000\nand when we do we start\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:52.000\nlike cognifying differently we start\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:54.000\nrecognizing like how to make\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:56.000\nmaps and shit that we wouldn't understand if we didn't have\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nlanguage what a podcast\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nthey say like\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:02.000\npeople who speak different languages different grammatical\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nstructures approach problem solving\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\ndifferences so it really does sort of feed\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:08.000\ninto each other because I can choose to say that\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.000\nyou're sitting on top of the box or that the box\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:12.000\nhas you on top of it\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:14.000\nwhat do you think of it the language is absolutely\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:16.000\nthought and literally when you're speaking\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:18.000\na different language is different parts of your brain are\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\ngoing so it's like the pathways\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:22.000\nare different I could feel it if I want\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.000\nto switch to Urdu that my brain works\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:26.000\nslightly differently when I switch back it like\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\ntakes me a second to lock back into it\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:30.000\nthat's what they say about Urdu\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nyou never go back\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:34.000\nonce you go or do you never go back\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nyeah that's what I was trying to\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.000\nin Urdu you say if you\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:40.000\ngo back you never Urdu\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nsee that's why that's the thing\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nit's a beautiful language\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:46.000\nand by the way\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:48.000\nbeautiful\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:50.000\nput a big fat asterisk on the idea\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nsome of my favorite operas are Urdu\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\nthe fact that language is thought\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nthe fact that we think\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:58.000\nas we speak and that the words\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:00.000\nwe say are actually\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:02.000\nthe pathways of our brain\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\nthat is a lot different from saying that\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\ncertain specific words are\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:08.000\nmagical and need to be either\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:10.000\ncelebrated or buried\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.000\nthat's dumb\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:14.000\nlike there's no\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:16.000\nsmart way to approach that\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:18.000\nbut I do think words do have meaning\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:20.000\nyou were saying that earlier and people do use\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\nwords differently to oppress or further\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:24.000\na certain thing there's a reason\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:26.000\nit's called pro-choice and pro-life and not\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:28.000\npro-abortion and you know so these words\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:30.000\ndo have certain and that's what the Nazis did a lot\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\ninstead of calling it when they kill all the Jews\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:34.000\nit was the final solution\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:36.000\nand when they had the Jews sort of\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:38.000\nrunning the camps that was called joy division\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:40.000\nso those words\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:42.000\nthey're not just words they

wiping\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.000\nand whatever I guess that's better than\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:58.000\nletting it sit on your face\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:00.000\nthat's a social\n\n58:00.000 -->

right I mean in the way\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nthat you should be right he's right\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.000\nbut you're not going to get that\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:32.000\nit's always going to be

I actually was a drow, so no worries. I just want to know what her\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000\ncharacter...\n\n01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000\nFuck everybody that says girls don't play D&D.

I'm going to kick your ass.\n\n01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000\nIt's just that post-character generating shopping trip always ends up in...\n\n01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nAdam said, told me to kill your character and rape it.\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nOkay. Oh, his character.\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000\nYeah.\n\n01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000\nWe're already dead anyway. We almost died last time.\n\n01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nGreat job, Denise.\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000\nDid you hear last week's episode, Denise?\n\n01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000\nI did not. I was at a bot mitzvah scene.\n\n01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000\nWell, it ended with all of us being apparently choked to death by shadow monsters.\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000\nLike, for those of you listening...\n\n01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nOh, he's going to recap it for us, right?\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nI often do.\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nI have to say, I wasn't here, and miraculously, even though it kept being brought up, nobody\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nfucked my character last week.\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nWe didn't get to.\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nBecause we were all dying.\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nI know.\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nAnd sex was not on our minds.\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nIt still kind of was.\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000\nI sort of floated it. Nobody seemed into it.\n\n01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nSo I was like, all right.\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nAll right, so yeah, so we were hanging by a thread.\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000\nDan, you want to go grab the character sheet so we'll get this bitch kitty underway?\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000\nYeah. Do you have the...\n\n01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nDid you bring the music cues back?\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nYes, I do. I have the music.\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nSpencer, are you ready to get us up to date?\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nI'd like to think so.\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000\nAll right. Spencer, everybody.\n\n01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nAfter a confusing episode with a possessed Chris de Burgh and a brief return of Tylenol with Codine,\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000\nas well as a dangerous brush with a large black gate,\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nour heroes were accosted by a troop of blade-armed horrors.\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nAt first, the gang was winning, cutting down two of the shadowy foes in an instant.\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nSoon after, however, the tides of battle shifted and the shadows tried a new tactic,\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nchoking out the opponents with their smoky and substantial forms.\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nAs combat wore on, two more shadows were defeated,\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nbut Mulraine and Sharpie were caught by the limbs,\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000\ndimming their minds and dulling their senses as it choked them to death.\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000\nAfter trying to avoid the grappling shadows, Mulraine fired some arrows wildly\n\n01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000\nbefore passing out from suffocation.\n\n01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nSharpie slung fiery bolts at the shadows and managed to heal the party with the Soul of Growth,\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000\nbut in the end was also overcome by the shadowy smoke.\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000\nTwo losing consciousness.\n\n01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nThe remaining shadows squared off against Quark and Chris, who fucked around too much,\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000\ntrying to pull crazy tricks that failed utterly.\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nThey too were choked out and lost consciousness in short order.\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000\nThe party fly defeated on the floor,\n\n01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nand as their unconscious forms were dragged into the black gate by the shadowy assailants,\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nwho would know how they would get to their home?\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000\nYeah, so I fucked that one up.\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000\nCan't hit every audio cue.\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000\nThis podcast is brought to you by...\n\n01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000\nNabisco!\n\n01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000\nThank you, Spetha.\n\n01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nPut a cookie on it.\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nI knew I'd have to fail at something.\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000\nNabisco, which in Urdu means, your mom has a cock.\n\n01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nYeah.\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:18.000\nThe best is cock, co is mother.\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000\nSometimes that's all there is, you know.\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nThere's nothing more to be said than what's already been said.\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nSometimes you have a punchline, sometimes you just stop talking.\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nJust pull the record and just let the shoot deploy, man.\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nYou guys are on your own.\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nExactly.\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nSpeaking of on our own, so I'm gonna imagine that we need to be told what the hell's going on.\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nYeah, you guys aren't even awake yet.\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nIt's crazy.\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nAnyway.\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nWe all black out, right?\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nYeah, no, you're dead now.\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nReroll characters.\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nLet's go.\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nWait, we're dead?\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nNo.\n\n01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nI knew it.\n\n01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nI had a feeling this was like in a video game,\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nlike when you have no choice and just lose all your equipment,\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nsomeone hits you on the head.\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000\nClose, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nYour eyes slowly drift open, a dry burning,\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nclawing at your lids and your throat and your body throbs with pain.\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nYou can feel a heavy burden weighing on your neck,\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nshoulders, wrists, ankles, knees and toes.\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nYou look down.\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nKnees and toes, knees and toes.\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nHead, ankles, knees and toes, knees and toes.\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nWhat's that in throbbing pain?\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000\nOur pelvises?\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nNo, the mentioned body parts are weighed down by burdens,\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nwhich looking down you see are in fact shadowy chains\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nbinding your arms and legs to those of your adventurer friends,\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nlike some sort of chained gang.\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nSo we're all chained together?\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nYeah, you're chained and guarded by multiple,\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nI'd say nine of these same blade-armed guards.\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nYour chains are bound to a black wall that extends\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000\neasily about 300 feet tall or more.\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000\nAnd it's creating a huge ring-shaped arena,\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nsort of doughnut.\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000\nArena?\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nInside this doughnut, yeah.\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nAnd are we all together or are we in different parts of the world?\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nYou guys are chained to each other, so you're pretty close.\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nYou know you're maybe in like an eight-foot train.\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nSo we're at the edge of a circular wall\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nthat goes 300 feet in the air.\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nAnd it's a doughnut.\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nAtop the far walls you can see tiered steps of ashy stone grey rings\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nlike some sort of amphitheater or stadium.\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nPacked into the stepped rows of grey risers are thousands upon\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nthousands of silhouettes, forming a massive crowd of pulsing,\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nundulating dragons.\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nI don't like this trope, yeah.\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nIt's a classic.\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000\nThere's a reason it's a trope, Dan.\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nYeah, because it pits the protagonist in a horrible situation\n\n01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nthat I'm going to fail at.\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nAre they going to make us go like Spock against Kirk in this?\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nWho knows?\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nI kill myself instantly.\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nThat's a fair action.\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nDo you want to do that?\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000\nNo.\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000\nBut if we're going to be in a human centipede at any point,\n\n01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nI call the front.\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nI got middle. I got middle.\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nA lot of people don't know last, second to last is actually\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nfor various biological and toxicological reasons.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nIt's the same as being on Space Mountain, second to last.\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000\nThey call it the human centipede catbird seed.\n\n01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nIt actually results in you being pretty healthy after three weeks\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000\nif you get cut loose.\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000\nThere's a human centipede sequel, and there's a guy,\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nthe sequel is about a guy who saw a human centipede\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nand wants to try it on his own.\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nAnd then there's a scene where he has everybody in a warehouse\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nand then he walks out of the room,\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nand I think it's the first dialogue in the movie.\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000\nA guy who heard a reference to human centipede goes like,\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000\nit's from a movie. Did you see it?\n\n01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000\nThe human centipede.\n\n01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nHe's going to sew us ass to mouth.\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nAnd everyone starts going,\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nahhh.\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nLike, I would, if I had to,\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nhe's going to sew us ass to mouth.\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nI wouldn't have an immediate visceral reaction to that\n\n01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nthe way I would.\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nHe's going to pull out our fingernails\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nor he's going to eat our livers.\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nHe's going to sew us ass to mouth.\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nI'd be like, wait, what? What?\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nBut maybe they've seen the first movie.\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nYeah, I mean, I think that's the crime\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nis it's pretty simple.\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nEveryone saw the movie and they're like,\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nno, ass to mouth, I heard about that.\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nOh.\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nIt's like the McDonald's Monopoly game.\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nThat's why I didn't like the movie Predators,\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nyou know, the new Predators,\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nbecause they reference the first movie, not as a movie,\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nbut they say, oh, you know what he did\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nand then he covered himself in mud,\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nand that's how-\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nLike it really happened, like they read it in the Tribune?\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nThey were like, remember that happened\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nin the Predators, they do the same thing.\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nSo these guys can like have invisibility cloaks\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nand like homing lasers,\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nbut they can't figure out,\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000\nif you cover yourself in mud, they're flabbergasted.\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nYeah, they don't have mud, mud, mud, mud.\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000\nThey should just have like a water hose on their stove.\n\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000\nThey should just outlaw mud.\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nAll right, so what's up, Spencer?\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nSo I mentioned there's these nine guys guarding you.\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nYeah, I totally

01:28:22.000\nlike a stage, kind of situated in the middle.\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nAnd you can see hanging above the stage\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000\nis that massive glowing gray sun\n\n01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nthat actually caused your shadows\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000\nto depart in the first place,\n\n01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nhanging above the central ring.\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nAnd chained in the central ring,\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nyou can see a guy, it looks a lot like Breffi.\n\n01:28:36.000 -->

would be a terrible joke if that were a joke.\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nYeah, no, go ahead.\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nNo, it's my life.\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nThis is my life.\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nIt happens.\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nIt's a serious business.\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nYeah.\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nWe're on our own.\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nYeah, there's an old Farsi saying about bladder size.\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nYeah.\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000\nI only know the English translation.\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nHow does it translate?\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nHis Black Widow does not catch flies.\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nI didn't want to follow it through.\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nHonestly, my relationship with all of you\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nended that second time I said something\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nthat I think deserved a bigger laugh than I got.\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nAnd I started to think to myself,\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nI'm just going to edit you laughing in.\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nI'm just going to pick something else.\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nI can't remember what it was.\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nIt's called fascism.\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nYeah, and I'm going to edit that boo out,\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nthat guy that booed me.\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nThere's nothing you can do that I can't manipulate\n\n01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nand control.\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nAll right, so we're chained together.\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nThere's nine guards.\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nThere's an arena that we're in,\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nthen there's a stage in front of us.\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nAbove it is the glowing sun.\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nUh-huh, and below it is a Breffi lookalike.\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000\nA Breffi lookalike.\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nChained to the arena there.\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nRemind me of who Breffi was.\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000\nHe was the guy that turned into a...\n\n01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000\na frightened old man,\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nvery pale with long white hair,\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nyou know, rather spindly guy\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nthat occasionally turns into a large spidery monster.\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nI'd call out and say, are you Breffi?\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nHe can't hear you.\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nI bet it's like a human form,\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nlike if you and I existed in a place\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nwhere we had to look like spiders,\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000\nlike we would look like the same spider.\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000\nDid you ever see the arrival with Charlie Sheen?\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nNo.\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000\nHe kept seeing Ron Silver everywhere.\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.000\nAnd then he realized that the aliens\n\n01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000\nonly make so many rubber suits.\n\n01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nAh.\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nYou know, Mattel only issues out so many human costumes.\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nI yell out, have you seen the movie Arrival?\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nHe can't hear you.\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nOkay.\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000\nAre the guards...\n\n01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000\nIn fact, everything's eerily silent,\n\n01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000\nlike normally if you're packed in a stadium\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nor something, there'd be some noises, but in case...\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nWell, it's hard to clap when your hands are shadows.\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nTell me about it.\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000\nDon't force time at no laugh.\n\n01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000\nAnd it's all going in my memoirs.\n\n01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nAre the guards watching us?\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nThe guards, as it happens, are watching the central stage.\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nThey're looking at this chained man.\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nHe looks around and framed.\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000\nCan I summon the monkey and have him free my shackles?\n\n01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nThe monkey summon is only like once per day.\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nI guess you don't know that it's the same day,\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nbut you feel as if you can't cast any more spells.\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nI was passed out. How long was I passed out?\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nNot eight hours.\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nAlso, you haven't done the magic.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nDo we have our inventory with us, or has it all been taken away from us?\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nThat's a great question.\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nFumbling around.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nYou do notice you have your bags and things with you.\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nOkay.\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nYeah.\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nYeah, crazy.\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000\nAll of a sudden, the mood seems to shift,\n\n01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000\nand you see the breathy lookalike.\n\n01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nHis neck snaps to the left as if he's suddenly transfixed by something.\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nYeah, yeah. Following his gaze,\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nyou can see a black shadow streaking across the gray floor\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000\nof the stadium towards the old gray man.\n\n01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nThis is where we watch the guy in front of us.\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nYeah, get it.\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nYeah.\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nI said it.\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nThat happens.\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000\nDo you want to guess what happens next?\n\n01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000\nHey, don't punish our savvy.\n\n01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nThat's exactly what you do in Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nYou punish metagaming.\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nThat's a whole thing.\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nWell, then I'll just sit here and go like,\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nooh, wow, what's going to happen?\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nAnd get rewarded for it?\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nThat's all I ever wanted.\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:42.000\nThat path ends with fake brontosaurus.\n\n01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nI'll just go where the heat is.\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nYeah, that's fine.

01:35:53.000\nOkay, so other than light,\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nyou guys can see in the darkness that it's just Sharpie,\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nso he can barely see,\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nbut there's not really any light.\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000\nThe only thing that could be considered light\n\n01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nis the pulse of the sun.\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000\nYou mean Quark, right?\n\n01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nSharpie.\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000\nQuark has...\n\n01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nI'm human.\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000\nYeah, so you can't see in the dark.\n\n01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nEveryone else has low light.\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000\nOh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nI thought you were perfect.\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000\nBut I'm human, too.\n\n01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000\nYeah, but you got the goggles of night,\n\n01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nwhich let you use that dark vision.\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nOkay, continue, sorry, I misunderstood.\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000\nSo yeah, other than the dark sun pulsing,\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nthere is no real light,\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nbut even that was like a dark anti-light.\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nLike a shadow light.\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nLike instead of spreading light,\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000\nit spreads darkness.\n\n01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000\nYeah, that's also a thing in Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nNo, I know, I like it.\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000\nYeah, I'm just saying.\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000\nAnd Jeanine Garofalo must be really popular here.\n\n01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000\nYou feel a tug on your chains.\n\n01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nYeah, and you see the chains have detached from the wall,\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nand now the nine guards are leading you\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000\ntowards the central ring.\n\n01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000\nOh, maybe they're going to free us.\n\n01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nYeah, probably.\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000\nThe show's over?\n\n01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nYeah.\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000\nIt seems like, yeah.\n\n01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nI've never seen a movie or...\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000\nThey wanted to show us perfecting\n\n01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nfor the guy in front of us in the show.\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nYeah, yeah, we didn't like the guy either.\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000\nThanks, guys.\n\n01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000\nAll right.\n\n01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000\nWhere'd me park?\n\n01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000\nStanding in the center of the ring.\n\n01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000\nYou didn't really see how they got there,\n\n01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nbut you see four figures,\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000\none of which is markedly shorter than the rest.\n\n01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nOkay.\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000\nYou guys validate?\n\n01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nI'm still going with the part.\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nI'm still going with that.\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nThey pull you into the middle of the ring,\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nand you're facing these four fellows\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nthat look rather familiar.\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000\nOh, it's us!\n\n01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nThey're us.\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000\nThere are shadow versions of ourselves.\n\n01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nFuck!\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nAre they our shadows?\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000\nThey are.\n\n01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nThere are shadows.\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000\nGod damn it.\n\n01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nThink of all the tropes.\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000\nDo they have goatees?\n\n01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.000\nAnd does my guy have multiple number one hits?\n\n01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nThey're more like sprite recolors.\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nIt's just a lenient blue.\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000\nIt's a cotton green.\n\n01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000\nThey like it over there.\n\n01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000\nI think it's purple is the opposite color, right?\n\n01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nAll right.\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000\nNo, not purple.\n\n01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nNevermind.\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000\nGreen.\n\n01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nOkay, so where are we now?\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000\nYou're in the center of the ring,\n\n01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000\nfacing down your shadow duplicates.\n\n01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000\nOh, God.\n\n01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000\nYou see the guards who dragged you here\n\n01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nare kind of dispersed,\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000\nand you're no longer around,\n\n01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nbut you still have bindings around you.\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000\nOh, it makes sense,\n\n01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nbecause Brefi was a spider guy,\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nso now he fought his own version,\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000\nwhich was a spider guy.\n\n01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000\nAnd he got his ass beat for his troubles.\n\n01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nMurdered.\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nLuckily, we're not as strong as joint spiders,\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:26.000\nso these guys aren't going to be that strong.\n\n01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nDo they also have a lot of infighting going on\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nand raping each other when we're asleep?\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nYeah, why don't we just hang back\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nand watch them do bits until they die?\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000\nOne of them is a half Muslim Jewish person.\n\n01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nWhy is your shadow taking all of his inventory,\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.000\ntying it into a ball and throwing it around?\n\n01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000\nYou just keep fucking a football.\n\n01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000\nYeah, you're fucking everything, yeah.\n\n01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nYou feel the chains around you kind of drop off,\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000\nand they dissolve into mist,\n\n01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000\nand as this happens,\n\n01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nyou feel refreshed as if vitality\n\n01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000\nis coursing through you anew.\n\n01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000\nAll right, I'm only going to say this once.\n\n01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000\nNon-conflict resolution.\n\n01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nWorth a shot.\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000\nWorth a shot.\n\n01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nWorth a shot?\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000\nAlthough we are in an arena with spectators,\n\n01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000\nthis is probably the situation\n\n01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000\nwhere that's least going to work.\n\n01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000\nYou don't have baseball games where they're like,\n\n01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000\nyou know what, let's just hang out tonight.\n\n01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nBut it's ourselves.\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000\nAll right, let's try.\n\n01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nIt's us.\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000\nWell, do they move like us?\n\n01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000\nThey haven't moved since you've seen them.\n\n01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nWell, I will pull out an arrow and see\n\n01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000\nif my shadow moves in the same way.\n\n01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nIt doesn't move.\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nHow do I look?\n\n01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000\nYou look great.\n\n01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000\nNot bad.\n\n01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000\nCan I shoot my shadow in the foot?\n\n01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nDo you want to do non-conflict resolution?\n\n01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000\nI want to communicate.\n\n01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000\nI'm going to step forward holding my hands\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000\nin a nonviolent manner.\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nAnd I say, guys, you are us.\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000\nWe are you.\n\n01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:21.000\nThat means you don't want to do this either.\n\n01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000\nLet's not do it together.\n\n01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000\nAnd we'll have twice as much a chance as that working.\n\n01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000\nOf that working.\n\n01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.000\nYou're probably drunk too.\n\n01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.000\nA couple articles and prepositions aren't going to bug you.\n\n01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000\nI wait for your answer.\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000\nTake all the time you want.\n\n01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nI step back.\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000\nIn unison, the four draw their weapons.\n\n01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000\nYou're a fucking dick, Spencer.\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nAnd you were born a dick and you're going to die a dick.\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000\nYou're vindictive and you're petty.\n\n01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000\nAnd this is why people don't like Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:14.000\nThey think of nerds as being like these people with all this anger dwelling inside them\n\n01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000\nthat they take it out in these dice and things.\n\n01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nMaybe we should just go out in a football field and just fuck each other up.\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000\nSharpie?\n\n01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.000\nIf you like pain, if you like discomfort, let's go play football.\n\n01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000\nYou know, this is supposed to be about fun.\n\n01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000\nI don't want to die.\n\n01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000\nIt's Mother's Day.\n\n01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000\nShe loves season four.\n\n01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000\nIf I die, she won't even care.\n\n01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000\nShe won't notice.\n\n01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000\nShe was quoting lines.\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000\nI wasn't even there.\n\n01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000\nShe won't notice.\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000\nShe only knows I exist because of the fucking television.\n\n01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000\nAnd she's going like, oh, that was a good one.\n\n01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:06.000\nThis is like, you know how they do puppet therapy?\n\n01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nEpisode title.\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000\nHey, you're a druid or whatever.\n\n01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.000\nWhat is your druid's dad think of it?\n\n01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:28.000\nWhat part of your body did the magic missile get cast out?\n\n01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000\nAll right, so they've drawn weapons, I guess.\n\n01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000\nI guess this looks like we're going to have to slug it out, right?\n\n01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000\nDid you say earlier we felt suddenly rejuvenated like we were just reset?\n\n01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000\nYou got your spells back.\n\n01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000\nYeah, I was going to finish saying that.\n\n01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000\nBut yeah, all of your spells come back and you guys return to full health.\n\n01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000\nAwesome.\n\n01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000\nSo it's going to be seemingly a fair fight.\n\n01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000\nSeemingly.\n\n01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000\nI should remind you, you guys are still weakened from losing your shadows,\n\n01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000\nwhich has given you, you know, ability damage.\n\n01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000\nOh, these are our shadows that left.\n\n01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000\nYeah.\n\n01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000\nYeah, you weren't there and that happened.\n\n01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000\nI just put it together.\n\n01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000\nYeah, these are our shadows.\n\n01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000\nShit.\n\n01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:12.000\nSo if they win, they get to go hang out with the rest of society\n\n01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.000\nand the stands and watch people get ripped to shreds.\n\n01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000\nAnd if we win, we get to have them hang out underneath us when we eat ice cream.\n\n01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000\nIsn't that a little one-sided?\n\n01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000\nYeah, it seems like they have a lot going on.\n\n01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000\nIt's like we've entered a world where people, instead of shadows,\n\n01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000\nthey're completely disregarded and mistreated.\n\n01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000\nYeah.\n\n01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000\nHuh.\n\n01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000\nIn a world invisible the most.\n\n01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000\nThat's just deep.\n\n01:43:39.000 -->

any use.\n\n01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000\nDenise, do you want to fire the first shot?\n\n01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000\nOh, hell yes.\n\n01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000\nLet's let Denise get at least one shot.\n\n01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000\nWell, if I shoot at the shadows, is anybody here gonna take damage from...\n\n01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000\nAre they in some way linked to the shadows?\n\n01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000\nBecause, yes, I would shoot two into his.\n\n01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000\nShe points at Quark.\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000\nThere's no way of knowing

She was trying to hurt me.\n\n01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000\nAdam Goldberg told her to kill my character.\n\n01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000\nWhat if she was prioritizing the most affected combat?\n\n01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000\nThat's what the Iranians do, we infiltrate.\n\n01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000\nThat's right. She was prioritizing the most affected combatants.\n\n01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000\nYou're the best fighter we have, so she was getting your equipment.\n\n01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000\nShe was saying Adam Goldberg asked her to kill my character, and she was trying to do it.\n\n01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000\nYou go, girl.\n\n01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000\nI like my interpretation better.\n\n01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000\nYeah.\n\n01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000\nYeah.\n\n01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000\nI like it better, too.\n\n01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000\nAt the same time, Shadow Mulraine fires off three arrows, two of which also miss,\n\n01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000\nand one of which plants itself into Christopher.\n\n01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000\nWhat?\n\n01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000\nHappy Mother's Day, dealing four damage.\n\n01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nAlright, I'm okay with that.\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000\nAlright.\n\n01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000\nWhat are we going to stop now?\n\n01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000\nThat's up to you guys.\n\n01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000\nYeah, let's stop.\n\n01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000\nThe first shots have been blown.\n\n01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000\nYeah, if it bleeds, we can kill it.\n\n01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000\nI figured out a new way to end the show.\n\n01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000\nYeah?\n\n01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000\nWe review and make sure there's nothing to edit out for real, so that we can upload it quicker.\n\n01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000\nSounds exhilarating.\n\n01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000\nWhat did we say that we wanted to edit out?\n\n01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000\nThe community stuff.\n\n01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000\nWhat was it?\n\n01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000\nWe wanted to edit out that guy actually yelling the N-word.\n\n01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000\nWait, someone actually just yelled out the N-word?\n\n01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000\nYeah.\n\n01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000\nWho was it?\n\n01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000\nWho was it?\n\n01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000\nI'm black.\n\n01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000\nIt's okay.\n\n01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000\nOh, he's black.\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000\nWait, get up here.\n\n01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000\nGet up here, for fuck's sake.\n\n01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000\nAlright.\n\n01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000\nGod, just say it for us, would you?\n\n01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000\nOh, God, we got a Farsi woman to come up and say the C-word.\n\n01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000\nAlright.\n\n01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000\nWhat's your name, first of all?\n\n01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000\nNigger.\n\n01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000\nAlright.\n\n01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000\nYay!\n\n01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000\nIt's fun.\n\n01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000\nThey took it back.\n\n01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000\nThanks for coming to Harmon Channel, everybody.\n\n01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000\nWe did it.\n\n01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000\nLet's hear it one more time for Denise.\n\n01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000\nThank you so much, Denise, for coming up here.\n\n01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000\nSpencer.\n\n01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000\nKumail Nanjiani.\n\n01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000\nOkay.\n\n01:46:48.000 --> 01:47:06.000\nAnd everybody else, here we go.\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000\nJason.\n\n01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000\nWe're going to edit out his name.\n\n01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:17.000\nWell, it was already a fake name, right?\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000\nOne more time for Jason.\n\n01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000\nJason, I'm a digger.\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000\nA Burbank, California.\n\n01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nHappy Mother's Day, Jason's mom.\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000\nI'm Jeff Davis, your count.\n\n01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nTell her one more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:50.000\nGood night.\n\n01:47:50.000 --> 01:48:03.000\nGood night.\n\n01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:13.000\nGood night.\n\n01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:37.000\nGood night.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[171212]}
