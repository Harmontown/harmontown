00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Hello, everybody. Happy Mother's Day. Welcome to Harmontown.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Happy Sunday. Once again, Harmontown is in session.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm back. Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

00:21.000 --> 00:33.000
Welcome to the stage, the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Thank you. Happy Mother's Day.

00:33.000 --> 00:42.000
No more wire hangers, you guys. We watched Mommy Dearest today in bed. Aaron and I did.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
We weren't doing it thematically. We've been on this Joan Crawford kick and we just happened to be,

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
we were watching Mommy Dearest on Mother's Day, but it's a good one to watch on any day.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
I think about that movie a lot, mostly because I want her bathroom from that first scene with all the shower nozzles.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
I want a lot of that house. Yeah, that house was really good.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
But yeah, I was watching it and made me remember because that was like when I was a kid.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
And I remember, you know, America was fascinated with that movie. My mom really liked that movie.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
She was into it. She quoted a lot. She'd joke like, no more wire hangers, like when she would find herself giving hysterical.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
She'd self-efface by saying stuff like that. But also, she would do so much from the movie.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
And I was like, did she get the idea from the movie or did the movie maker feel better?

01:32.000 --> 01:40.000
I was like, oh, I didn't use a whole can of comic cleanser. I just wanted to clean the bathroom a little bit.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
I don't know. Happy Mother's Day. I called my mom today, as you all did.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, we did.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Or did you?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Anybody not call their moms?

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
See, you weren't making the joke that Goldberg was making. He called out, yeah, we did.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Called my mom, get it? He fucked my mom.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh, okay.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Well, payback is fair, right?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, sure.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
You've been fucking everyone's mom for a long time now.

02:06.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah. I called her, and great news, she loves Season 4 of Community. She loves it.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
She's very happy with it. She was quoting episodes. She's kind of...

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
And then I said, yeah, we should come up and we should get together sometime.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
And she went, yeah, cool, cool, cool, cool. Oh, sorry, sorry.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
And I just laughed about it. I was like, you're sorry about that?

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
I don't understand. So it registers in your brain that that's an issue socially,

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
but you just cool, cool, cooled for 10 minutes about the thing.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
And then I was on speakerphone because my dad was in the room, so then she did a classic Harmon move.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
She was like, what? Huh? What? I don't understand what you're saying.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
And I was like, never mind. What was your question?

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
She was like, question. It's not an inquisition. And I was like, I'm sorry. What the fuck's going on?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
God damn it, every year.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Have you watched Season 4? Do you watch it?

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
No, no, I haven't. I just, for selfish reasons and for altruistic reasons and just philosophical reasons,

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
I still haven't watched it. It's on my Tivo. I kept the season pass.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
So every time we game of thrones night, like tonight, we go there and I see a little folder that says Community.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
And I go, huh? So it's like looking at Instagram, you know?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
There's your ex-girlfriend out there.

03:31.000 --> 03:40.000
I picked that restaurant. I introduced her to that restaurant. I sewed that dress.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
Weird relationship.

03:46.000 --> 03:55.000
So, that was going to be part of my segment called Things Dan Harmon's Not Allowed to Complain About, because they make him sound like a rich douche.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
My mom loved Season 4 community.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
The other items are, I have a Black Widow infestation in my backyard.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
You're allowed to complain about that.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Not to people who don't have backyards.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
No, you've let them off the hook. Now they don't feel bad about not having a backyard.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah, guys, stay in your apartments. Backyards have Black Widows.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Erin was in the backyard. She moved a ceramic pot or a rabbit or something,

04:26.000 --> 04:38.000
and a Black Widow spider from the movies crawled across her hand and she killed it and then found its egg sack inside the ceramic rabbit.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
They're all over our garage too. They're all up in our garage.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
She keeps telling me these stories about Black Widows crawling on her.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
It's like Christopher Walken and Deer Hunter. It's like, stop whatever you're doing. Knock it off.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Stop putting your hands under ceramic items.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
This is building a tree stump in Flash Gordon in our front yard so she can just put scorpions in and reach into it every day.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
If I have a golf ball that goes slightly into a bush, I get the longest club in the bag.

05:09.000 --> 05:16.000
Unless you live anywhere with snow on the trees, don't touch a bush.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
I came to California with that knowledge, just from time-life books about spiders.

05:22.000 --> 05:30.000
I was a big spider guy. When I was a kid, I loved spiders. I would go out behind the garage in Wisconsin and I would play with bugs.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
I was fascinated with them. I probably would have been an entomologist or something or an arachnidotopia.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
I would just play with spiders and bugs and stuff.

05:42.000 --> 05:53.000
So much so that one of my aunts for Christmas gave me this big colorful book for adults about spiders because there was something I was really into.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
I read the book. It was just a scientific book about the world's most poisonous spiders.

06:00.000 --> 06:16.000
I remember reading descriptions of the Black Widow. It remains relatively still, but it also has a lot of...

06:16.000 --> 06:29.000
But its reflexes are so fast that it can traverse the length of a broomstick and a human arm faster than the human ability to drop the stick or something like that.

06:29.000 --> 06:40.000
Purposely using measurements to terrify you. It will be in your ear eating your brain before you can say there's a spider in my ear eating my brain.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
I have a pretty live and live policy with bugs and stuff like that. I don't like ants. No one wants a bunch of ants in their place.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
If I see one ant, that's the scout ant, so I do that. I whack that ant so I make sure that he doesn't go back and tell the tale about it.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
You put his head on a microscopic pike.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
I have a little tiny curb and I kick his teeth in.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
I always kill one when there's another one watching and then I look at the other one and I say...

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
It doesn't work. I've tried to tell your friends that it doesn't work.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
They do tell their friends and they go, oh, the breadcrumb is still there?

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
So now Kevin's dead, so if nothing else, we can eat Kevin.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Because they're insects.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Or we can go team up on that asshole that killed Kevin.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
In their dreams.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
Spiders, no. I told you a story about me falling asleep one time. I was 24, I had a girlfriend and I was staying at her place.

07:33.000 --> 07:40.000
We were asleep naked and I woke up and there was a sound of what I thought was a moth had gone into my ear.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
I was laying on my left side and something that sounded like a one-man band was in my brain.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
I jump up naked and I'm running around the room screaming. She's laughing because she looks hilarious.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
But I hear...

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
It's that loud and it's freaking out.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
And I'm trying to hit my head and get it out and I'm punching myself in the ear.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
And she's like, what are you doing? It was a moth, it was a flyer, bugs in my ear.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
And it was so loud and it was non-stop beating on my, like flapping on my eardrum.

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
And I start, I punch myself in the head as hard as I can, dazing myself and the bug.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And then I hear...

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Which I think was his heart.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
I just dazed it and stunned it for a while and then it starts going again.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
And every time I try to, she turns a light on but I have to turn my head up to the light

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
which makes the feeling of gravity is going to bring it farther into my brain.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
And I don't want to do that so I'm trying to get water out of your ear and that's not working.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
So I've been told later on that if that happens, if a bug goes in your ear, pour alcohol in there.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Like, knock it out, get it drunk, fuck it up and then at least the insanity will stop.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
But I'm just losing my mind and punching myself and she takes some twitters out and tries to get it

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
and it long lasts and it takes a long time, we're both nude in the bathroom, in the middle of the night.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
And she's like, we'll get you to a hospital, like I'll be insane by the time we get to the hospital.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
I seriously will lose my mind, it was freaking me out and the noise was so loud and now it's scrambling

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
and I feel the sensation of it burrowing in.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
It's going the wrong way.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
It's not going to go the way that I was punching.

09:21.000 --> 09:30.000
It's like, it descended from hundreds of generations of spiders that survived humanity.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
There's just a crazy giant outside, it's not going to go that way.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
It knows exactly when to stay put.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
So she gets my head up this way to the light so the air is pointing up and she puts the tweezers down my ear

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
and manages to get halfway into my brain and pulls out a spider the size of a nickel.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
And worth every penny.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
That's been our show, goodnight everybody.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
And it flies out and we both scream because it's quite alive and it's pretty scary looking

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
and it hits the ground running and so I barefoot just go wham and stamp on it with a size 13 and a half barefoot foot

10:11.000 --> 10:20.000
and I lift up my foot and it goes whew, it just shrugs it off and gets up and kicks it off.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
There are days and there are days.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I can't get a break around here.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Like I wanted to be in your ear.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
It looked like a barn.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
So it just fell down my ear and they say that we eat lots of bugs in our sleep and don't know it

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
but I finally managed to kill it and then for the rest of the time we dated which wasn't long

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
she kept putting fake spiders in the bed.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
What?

10:45.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah just to be honest I believe the word is asshole and it's the worst so now like I used to sleep with a capillow on my head

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
and stuff and it's terrible.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
Alright so now, sleep tight everybody.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
Alright my mom loves season 4.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
We're infested with Black Widows.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
We're going to have a guy come take care of it.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
I sound like an asshole because you guys couldn't have a guy come take care of it.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I'm going to call the Black Widow guy.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
I don't know who he is.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
Harvey Keitel is going to pull up in a Ferrari.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
My animated show is going to take till December for you guys to get to see.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I'm very excited.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
That's another thing I'm complaining about.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
People keep spreading rumors about me going back to season 5 of the community.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm complaining about that.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
That navigation system in my Prius.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I keep dropping blue flags everywhere.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
That's the worst.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
You know what I'm talking about?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
5% of the audience, who's got this goddamn navigation system?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Fucking blue flags.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I keep dropping blue flags.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Anybody with a Toyota or a Lexus I think.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
Every intersection here can fucking drop a blue flag at random spots.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I got blue flags all over the city.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
There's a menu you can delete the blue flags.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I know but you're never going to do that are you?

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
You're always on your way somewhere and you're dropping these blue turds all over.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
Precisely when you're trying to do the opposite, which is figure out where you're going and

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
you're putting flags all over the thing.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
Okay, I'm going to go home from work now.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Are you sure you don't want to go to one of these blue flags?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
You like so much?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Go to Ivar.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
You loved it.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
You put a blue flag there.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
No.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Nicole.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
I call my car Nicole.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
I'm not going, I'm just saying the call Kidman thing?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Is that one?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah, probably.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I don't know.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I don't name my car.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
I have better things to do.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I can't even name characters I create.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
The community has all my friends names.

12:49.000 --> 12:57.000
So that rumor on Deadline, I think the reason for it is because weeks ago Sony reached out

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
through private channels, not that they would have ever reached out through honest public

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
ones.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
The way that big studios work is that they're in the business of getting their shows syndicated

13:11.000 --> 13:18.000
and I think that in the days before they were sure that community would get that very important

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
next 13 episodes, which to them that's all it represents is just the number 13.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
They don't care if any of those 13 are good or bad.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
They just needed those 13 so that they could not get fired by the machines that make the

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
money from the 97 episodes.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
It'll be very lucrative for me as well.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
We're all very happy.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Everyone except the people that never made any money and who got tattoos of Abbott on

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
their thigh.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
We're all thrilled to pieces about this episode order.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
But back before it happened, when they were in the position of what can we do to make

13:52.000 --> 13:58.000
sure this happens, in their misguided bottom line minds we're thinking, let's sweeten the

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
kitty.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Maybe we could tell NBC, Dan will come back and that way there will be all kinds of press

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
and that's how little they care.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
That's how little shame they have.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
They don't care.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
To them that wouldn't be winning or losing, they don't care.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
I think that in the ensuing weeks, during which time NBC finally made a decision to pick up

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
the show so it doesn't matter, someone's assistant probably told someone's assistant and someone's

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
friend over drinks that that conversation happened for a second and resulted in maybe a

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
deadline article which resulted in a bunch of other press about it.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
So you're going back?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Tuesday.

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
No, my point is I don't think it's a question that I would even have a yes or no answer to.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
I don't think that is a choice that I have.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I haven't read this article.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
For all I know you're perpetuating this myth right now.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I probably am.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
I'm trying to make Harmontown a thing you should come to and listen to, I guess.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I don't know.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
I'm participating.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Where's my clicks?

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Wait, but Chevy's not in the show anymore.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
We've got to get him here.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Well, he's a...

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Why?

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
Because it'll be insane.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Why not bring Chevy Chase once to Harmontown?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Did you see him on SNL?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
No.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Do you understand what happens when he walks into a room?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Everything gets complicated.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
I'm not saying it's going to be fun.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I'm just saying that we all muscle up.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
It's like going to play paintball.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
It hurts.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
It's sweaty.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
You get bruised.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
I just don't see it the way you see it.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I call him.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
He calls me sometimes.

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
The concept is funny on paper, but...

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Can we Skype him?

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
Can we get a screen up and do a little via satellite thing?

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
Yeah, he seems pretty tech-savvy.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
He's probably Skyping me right now.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
I can't figure out how to filter it right.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
He can.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
He does a lot of PHP programming in his spare time.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Anyways, I just wanted to address that because people tweet me.

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
And I thought maybe that would be fun, worth your $10 alone to come out and hear me say out loud.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Alright, so I think that ends the...

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I had stuff to talk about segment.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I saw an Arrested Development poster outside Meltdown.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I got really excited.

16:26.000 --> 16:33.000
It was cool for me.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
It might be a little cameo in one of those episodes by a certain fat alcoholic.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Close to your hearts.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
And may or may not have gone out and visited that set.

16:45.000 --> 16:54.000
I also had to edit out the whole for anyone that was here when I described me being on the set of a Terrence Malick movie with...

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
What's his name? Batman in it?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
John Landis.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Christian Bale.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Did you know John Landis is the new Batman?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I was very surprised.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
It's weird, but they're going back to a kind of classic feel.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
I told the story about going and being on the set of a Terrence Malick movie with Christian Bale,

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
and then I had to edit the whole thing out for the very specific reason that, as Aaron pointed out to me on the way home,

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
I got to...

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
It's okay for me to say that I got to do that and how cool it was.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
It's not okay for me to reveal absolutely anything about the film itself,

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
which I did in the process of talking about the movie, so I lifted the whole thing out.

17:34.000 --> 17:41.000
The only thing that's left is that I get to say, I did this thing and who cares?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
It's like hearing someone talk about a slot machine in Vegas.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
It's amazing, I was up and then I was down.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
They'll fuck yourself, who cares?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
When people tell you about their Dungeons & Dragons characters,

17:54.000 --> 18:01.000
he was a level five mage and he had an eyepatch and a hawk on his dick.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
It's make-believe.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
While you were gone, Bill poisoned us.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Hello Bill, I just heard that, it's hilarious.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Bill, were you also the guy we were talking about?

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Where are my cookies?

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Or did those get destroyed in the bonfire you had afterwards?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I don't know, maybe they're back stage.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
I would have been the only one that lived had everybody died from the beef jerky.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
Bill, settle a bet.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
Spencer said you were the benign deviant guy.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Yes.

18:34.000 --> 18:44.000
So Bill wasn't a stranger bearing meat, he was our old friend.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Did you call up the supplier or was that neglected on your part?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Did you just leave it out too long?

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
I did wait it too long because I had to miss a show.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Ah, he's blaming us now.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
No, it was me.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
You had to miss a show.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Well, we all made it.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
It was very funny.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
What was your emotional takeaway from all that?

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
It was kind of a roller coaster of whether or not you were a good person or a bad person.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
In the moment, I sort of shut down.

19:15.000 --> 19:23.000
In the moment, I sort of shut down, but then when I heard everybody applauding in the podcast,

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
when I listened to it later, I finally felt like I could forgive myself.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
I heard everybody go, yeah, but I could not hear that.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Oh, really? That's interesting.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
That happens. I think that's some kind of weird...

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
When I'm on stage, I often...

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
Actually, less now than never, but I've already...

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
Worrying about what other people think causes it kind of weird.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
The same thing is when you're running a marathon and those drugs flood your body

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
that don't let you know that your muscles are shredded and that you're in pain and stuff.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
It makes you kind of deaf and insensitive to things,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
so you're kind of in your own little bottle in your head, I think.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
That's what happened to you.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Or it was the fungus.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
You may have poisoned yourself.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
I was worried that the fungus took over my brain and made me bring it.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
After the show, I crawl up on the fire escape to get as close as possible to the sun

20:20.000 --> 20:26.000
and then just a leaf comes out of my head.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
That is the coolest fungus of all,

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
the one that makes ants' brains go crazy and makes them climb a tree.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
That's the thing that's terrifying about that is this,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
that there was a day before that fungus existed

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
and then there was a day, it was Wednesday of maybe 6,000 BC, we don't know.

20:45.000 --> 20:53.000
But that fungus, from the ants' perspective, Wednesday was fine

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
and then Thursday, Nathaniel was going like,

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
and then because it was, I don't know.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I'm sure there was lots of trial and error in the fungus' part.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
There was lots of fungus in the ants' brains.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
They would get in the brain and fuck them up and then that fungus didn't survive,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
but the fungus that specifically...

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
It got in there and learned how to vulture on the ants' brains,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
drive them up the tree, like make his legs move.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
It's really crazy.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I don't know, Jeff.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I think that's too complicated for random mutation.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
I'm converting to intelligent design.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
Me and Ben Stein are going to go on a retreat.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I've had it.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Hi, ball. It is complex.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
I give up. No more science.

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
That human eye, who would do that?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I mean, who wouldn't?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
What random system would do that?

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
That's the intelligent design main argument.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Look at the human eye.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Ben Stein's into that now?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
I think he is.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
I saw a trailer for a documentary

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
that played a lot of punk rock music or something while he walked around,

22:08.000 --> 22:15.000
and I think the implication was that he was doing a religious thing,

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
but saying God existed.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Who cares?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
On either side, who cares?

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
The only thing more obnoxious than somebody beating down doors

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
and insisting God exists is somebody insisting he doesn't.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
It's so dumb, such a dumb argument.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Who cares?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I saw Bill Maher, it's like, believe what you want,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
but he's just being a dick about it.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Almost you would say evangelical.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I just can't stand.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
And dogmatic, and being a fundamentalist,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
and being just a tool.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
He's knocking on my door and thumping a book

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
called Not the Bible.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Also, he just seems like a terrible guy anyway.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
If you've nailed a way of life,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
advertise for it with a big smile on your face and hanging out.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
And then let me go, God damn it, I love that guy.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
How can I be more like him?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Let me sneak into your underwear drawer,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
find your Bible, and because I need to know

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
how to be as happy as you.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Walk around scowling.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
I don't want to know what you put in your drink at night.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
I got my own problems.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
The problem is that everybody thinks that

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
everyone's codependent, everyone insists that only if and when

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
everyone in the world does exactly the same thing

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
will all our problems be solved.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
And so people justify simultaneously being completely unhappy

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
and being totally passionate about some point of view.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Which if everyone just would, you know,

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
you gotta tend your own garden,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
because that way you're not,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
people could just counter your argument by going,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
well then why are you such a miserable sack?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And I think that's why people are into politics.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
It's not really because they care that much.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
It's because it justifies being a miserable

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
and evangelical piece of shit,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
simultaneously without being a hypocrite.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
I think the appeal of politics is that you can pretend

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
that your point of view is important,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
even though it clearly isn't to you.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It's like in the electrical acid test,

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
and Ken Keezy is asked to speak,

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
like is it Berkeley or whatever,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
and all the kids are like, you know,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
like let's change everything, change everything.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
And he's the voice of that, you know,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
that time and that movement they think.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
And he gets up and he's like,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
yeah, it just kind of seems like you're all just yelling,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
me, me, me.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Like it's all about just I.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
It's like it's all just you just saying your name out loud.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Didn't Abbie Hoffman,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Abbie Hoffman gave a big speech

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
at some point in the 60s, you know,

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
when everybody was goofing around.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Abbie Hoffman did a thing where he got up and like,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
he said this whole speech,

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
and everybody was cheering for it,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
and he's like, I can tell you guys love this speech,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
but I gotta, I feel bad taking credit for it.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
It was actually written by Adolf Hitler.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
In 1935, I just gave you a speech

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
from Hitler.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Did he change it?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Did he change some words?

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I'm sure he translated it into English.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
But I'm sure it was,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
but I bet he didn't have to change that much

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
because it was probably just general.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
I mean, every time Hitler spoke,

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
he didn't say let's kill six million Jews.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Otherwise, that would be, you know,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
that roulette wheel would have come up double zero

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
at a certain point.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
So it would be like, six minutes, come on.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
I got work tomorrow.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
Most of the time, he was saying very similar stuff

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
to every politician you've ever heard in your life,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
which is we're so fucking amazing.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
We're gonna be amazing from now on.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
We haven't been amazing in the past,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
but now we're gonna be really amazing tomorrow,

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
and it's gonna be because we're strong

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
and we're together.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
And words that mean absolutely nothing

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
in a world where we then team up

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
on specific words like retarded and the n-word

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
and go, okay, let's get rid of these words

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
because these things are like abracadabra.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
If I say retarded enough in the wrong way,

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
the retarded people are gonna be even more retarded.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
If we eliminate the word, retardation will go away.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Not that it should because they're amazing people,

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
and it's language that's the real handicap.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Meanwhile, people who say words that have no meaning at all

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
are actually actively oppressing people

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
and causing things that result in people being physically hurt,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
and they get away with it because their words are porridge

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
instead of having any flavor.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Porridge can be good, I'm not saying.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Porridge shouldn't be synonymous with lack of flavor.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
It gets a bum rap because famous porridge

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
is from Oliver Twist and the classic teddy bear story.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
They make bad porridge famous.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Bad porridge is, yeah, bad porridge

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
is a higher profile than good porridge.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
There's not enough...

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
We need to start an anti-porridge defamation league

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
for some kind that can...

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
Where are the stories where Jack climbs a beanstalk

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
and he finds golden porridge?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
What qualifies something as porridge?

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
I think it has to...

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Can someone look that up over here

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
and tell me what makes porridge porridge

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
and not just a nice bowl of cream of wheat

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
or grits or something like that?

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Isn't porridge just warm breakfast cereal,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
like oatmeal, cream of wheat, grits?

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
The way pudding is just dessert in England,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
like pudding just means dessert, basically.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
No, pudding is lots of things.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
It's also like savory things.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
You can get a pudding at any meal of the day there.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
So maybe porridge is just like a bowl of hot...

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
Boiling, ground, crushed or chopped cereal

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
in water, milk or boats.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
That's a lot of ores.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
We have optional flavors.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Yeah, so it's grits.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
It's bad cereal.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
Boiled or poached, cereal, wheat, grain

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
or human had served or not served

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
in a bowl or on a platform for breakfast

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
or to send a message to the enemy.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Or anything in between.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Now then, what makes gruel gruel?

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Is gruel just the world's worst porridge?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Yeah.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
Yeah, gruel's worse than bad porridge.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
On the Homeland Security porridge color-coded scale.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
We can formulate the world's most culturally biased

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
SAT question out of this.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Porridge is to gruel as gruel is to...

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
All right, well, let's...

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
I don't have shit to talk about.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Let's get the stars on stage.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Yeah, season five in your dreams with me.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
They haven't asked.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
If they asked you, and let's say they gave you

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
the keys to the kingdom. I am a professional storyteller

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
and that's an amazing third act.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
So, yeah, I would definitely...

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
I would not be closed to that amazing story.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
You bummed out they haven't...

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I mean, I'm not going to ask you.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
No, Tessie, this is the thing.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
This is the reason I refuse to be bummed out they haven't asked.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
God, that's not fair.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
I get to be happy they haven't asked.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
That is my luxury.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
That is why when Sony reached out to my agency and said,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
my response to my agent was like,

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
when you guys figure out a yes or no question to ask me

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
all together as one collection of suits,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
I will then have a question to answer.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
I'll be goddamned if I'm going to fall.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
I was a nerd in high school. I know how this shit works.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
I was supposed to go like, yeah, I'd go back

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
and then get an email from Bob Greenback going,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
I heard you'd said you'd come back.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Uh-uh, bitch.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I don't know who you think you are,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
but the voice is doing real good.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
We don't need your ass.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
And I went, what the fuck did I do?

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I just jumped twice.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
I don't even like you people.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I'm happy in forensics.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
You can take your cafeteria table and stick it up your ass.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
All you guys do is sit there and talk about how thin you are.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
I have friends in the drama club,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
we're close.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
We've got a rocky horror together.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
I have meaningful relationships.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
I don't care how popular you are.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
I do a little bit. It was fun.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
Do you still retain popularity

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
because you are still attached to that show,

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
but do you miss the kind of day-to-day popularity of like...

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
No, no, no.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I miss the day-to-day like actual substance

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
instead of the kind of day-to-day like talking about,

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
you know, I miss the actual like short-term

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
let's put on a show every week.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
How did you feel about that?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Here's your reaction, you know,

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
the building and building and building

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
of that drum circle of fans.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
That beast getting fed

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
and then responding to it with creations of their own.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I'm not blowing smoke.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
I'm blowing the actual content and the creation of it

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
and the response to it and that fire burning.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
I don't miss the byproduct of it,

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
which was like people talking about me,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
which inevitably would always result in people saying

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
I was fat or psycho or something like that.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
You get ash with that ember.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
It doesn't matter.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
But what I miss is the fire.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
What a metaphor. Go fuck yourself.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Have another drink.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
Joe Crawford eyebrow painting,

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
cream-faced, no-wire hanger lovin'.

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
No-wire hanger lovin'.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
You no-wire hanger lovin', bitch!

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
There was just one black guy in that movie

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
to stand up and really give it to her.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
You don't hate wire hangers. You love the absence of wire hangers.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
There's so many times in that movie

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
where the daughter pauses outside the house

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
before going back in one more time

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
or convent academy or whatever.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I actually just realized that you needed

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
one black guy in the front row to go,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
don't go in there!

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Stop it! She keeps hitting you!

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I'm almost certain no black person

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
ever saw a mommy dirty.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
If they did, they'd probably be so confused.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Everyone knows black people are

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
synonymous with

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
an experience in life

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
and a set of perceptions.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
They're completely objectified.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Subset of humanity. We all know that.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
All right.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I'm being sarcastic.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Your silence disturbs me sometimes.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
I got the message from the survey last week.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Half of you think I'm racist

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
and a majority of you are the juries out.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I want to talk a little bit about

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
what I listened to while I was away,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
so we should probably get Spencer and Camille up here.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Can we get Spencer, Brendan

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
and Kumail Nanjiani to the stage?

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
By the way, you know the headline

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
on Deadline Tomorrow is going to be

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Dan Harmon expresses strong desire to return.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I don't feel sorry for myself for a second

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
at all, obviously.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
I have lots of money

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
and I'm an amazing person

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
and I'm going to live till

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
90 and I'm going to die

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
in a bed of money with six dogs

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
licking my nipples.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
You know, the whole American dream.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
And a huge tapestry

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
made out of dead Black Widows.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Just little tiny Black Widow heads

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
like a big game hunter and little

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
little mahogany crests.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I'll have an Australian

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
assistant who really kind of bagged them all for me.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I like Roosevelt.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I go out with a monocle and an elephant gun.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
That one there.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
He could run across a broomstick

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
and cross your arm faster than you could react.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Not anymore, he can't.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
He was about cheater speed.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
He's obviously the guy

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
that's really behind all the kills

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
but I'm like, oh, that one there.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
That was an eight legged.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I think there were mostly eight legged.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
You would be the kind of guy

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
who would never be invited back to the...

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
You would end up in a mysterious

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
shooting accident on my yacht.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
All the Black Widow heads in my head also.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Are they super...

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
To bring together two things,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
spiders and religion in Islam,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
at least my sect of Islam,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
at some point in history, there was a spider

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
and the good guy was hiding from the bad guys

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
and the spider made a web to hide

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
the bad guy.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
So in my sect of Islam,

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
spiders, you can't kill them.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
They're all over the place.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
It's not religious

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
society but it's bad luck to kill a spider.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Oh, is that right?

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
It's interesting that it gets

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
all turned around like that.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
So we had spider webs.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I don't think it's bad luck to step on

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
a brown recluse or something like that.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
California, I've noticed

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
there's a lot less mention of how much

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
bad luck it is to kill spiders.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
In Wisconsin...

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Everybody likes the little daddy long legs

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
to chill out and eat bugs.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Those are arthropods.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
All right, sometimes

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I don't know how I can get up in the morning.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
It's not how you get up, it's how can you

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
go to sleep at night then.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Who do you think has been putting all those black

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
winners in your garage then?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I go to bed at night amongst a nest

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
of very well respected arthropods

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
who, like porridge,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
do not deserve the wrap they got

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
from spiders.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
You know that urban legend,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
everyone thinks that daddy long legs,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
they say, it's the most poisonous

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
beast on earth,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
but it can't pierce the human skin

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
with its handables.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
So you let a daddy long leg

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
crawl on your hand and nothing's ever going to happen.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Because it's like the brontosaurus

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
of spider looking things.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
It's like a ridiculous...

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
It maybe would eat an ant leg

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
if it found one in the mail.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Well, you know,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
if it had the right address on it.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
If it just said to resident, it would be like,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I can't.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
It's going to be so frustrating.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
You know, brontosaurus don't exist.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
That was a hoax.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Brontosaurus,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
they have been taken out.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
They're not real dinosaurs.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Oh, Jesus.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
They got Plutoed.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Well, here's the story.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
It's like Bobby and John Kennedy.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Because you got the brachiosaurus,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
which is when it looks like it,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
and then famously sneezes a lot

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
of kids with that.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Only when it's hilarious.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Apparently, there were two paleontologists.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I forget the exact...

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
This was like the 60s or something,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
who were like fighting each other.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
They were all like traveling all over the world

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
to discover new dinosaurs.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
It's called the bone wars.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
It's really fascinating.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
It really is called the bone wars.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
So they were like hurrying up to discover more.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
So the one guy started putting together

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
different heads and bodies

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
of different species.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Just for the street grab?

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
And he totally won,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
and the other guy got totally discredited.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
And then after the winner died,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
they found out that he made up all these dinosaurs,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
including the brontosaurus.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
But as far as the winner knows,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
he died with the belt. He died champion.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Oh, he died with six puppies licking his nipples.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
But the winner knew he was cheating.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
He died knowing he was a fraud.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Yeah, but he had hoaxed the world,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
and probably...

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
The person that does that probably died happy.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Probably slept like a baby.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
What a cock.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Use Christ to resurrect him,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
just to slap him in the face

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
for the damage that does

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
in the science versus religion wars.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
You fucking idiots.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Do you know what a fucking meal

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
these red necks are going to make out of this?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
It's all made up. Look at this.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Oh, man.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
There are people out there publishing coloring books

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
teaching children that dinosaurs didn't exist,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
that bones were buried by the devil

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
and the people that made Space Lab

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
in the 70s,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
so that we could dig them up in the 80s

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
and pretend there were the dinosaurs.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Like warping children's brains.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Did you see that fourth grade test

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
from some Christian school that was like,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
when was the Earth created?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
It says 6,000 years.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Did humans and dinosaurs live together?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Yes. It's all

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
like super creationist.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
It came out like three, four days ago.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It's not a Tumblr.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I got to draw the line there.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
That's where I would care about politics.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
You've got to be kidding me.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
A kid doesn't even have a chance.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
That's not politics. That's just

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
ignorance.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Everyone that's passionate about something political,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
like that's their big thing.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
This isn't even politics. This is a fucking holy war.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I'm going to blow up this clinic.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Sorry, what?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
That's like, for people who are anti-religion,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
we are anti-religion because

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
of people like that.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Yeah. Well, that's what he's saying.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
The town hall is crying out.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Yes. That's why exactly.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Yes. The people

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
who are anti-religion, who let's call it

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
the Bill Maher end of the spectrum,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
that is the

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
kick in the shins to which they're reacting.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I absolutely

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
understand that.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Obviously, if there was

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
a big rumble,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I'm not going to bring

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
a bike chain to the Christian side

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
of it.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
But

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
my only point is

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
that

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
if we know that people are

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
kind of dumb

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
and we know that what

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
kind of motivates them is like

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
anger at

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
smart people,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
like,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
what good is like a bunch of smart people

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
that their face is going to do?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I don't know.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
This is going to lose everybody.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
I'm sure this is not the audience for this.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
I watched the player's championship,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
the golf thing, the Tiger one today.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
And the commentators are very good.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
They know a lot about golf.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
They look at everybody's swing and they know exactly

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
what's going on. They know everything about

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
grass. What kind of grass does what?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
They can read the grains. It's kind of fascinating

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
the amount of knowledge it goes into. I'm not a great golfer.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I'm not an avid golfer.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I suck.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
There's a thing now because of TV

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
and because somebody heard the first time

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I don't know if it was because of

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Billy Madison. What's the golf one?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Happy Madison?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Happy Gilmore. I always do that.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I always do that too.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
He named his production company

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
a mixture of the two.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Just to fuck with old people.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Every single time

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Tiger and a lot of other popular

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
golfers strike the ball,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
get in the hole!

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
There's eight douchebags

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
with the same khaki pants on and the same shirt

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
and the same tailor-made ball cap

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
and they all yell get in the hole.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
But it'll be the tee shot and a par fucking five.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
The hole is 550 yards away

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
that ball's not going in the hole.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
And so everybody else get in the hole

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
but now it's because

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
they've heard these famous calls

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
like a great putt that somebody made

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
and I'm the guy, that was my get in the hole

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
when Tiger did that thing.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Everybody's trying to beat each other

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
to get in the hole but they have to wait

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
also with camera clicks.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
So you've got all these 75 IQ fuckers

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
that are dressed in the exact same outfit.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
The homogeneity of

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
golf fans attire is troubling

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
to me.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
There should not be that much khaki on that

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
when you pay all white people.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And it's really disturbing.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
It's really Nuremberg-y and gross.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Too much brown fabric

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
and too big a crap.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
It's a great time at the tournament.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Little Nuremberg-y but...

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
So today...

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
It's a crystal knocked-ish out here.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Little joy division-ish.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
The commentators are all very clearly intelligent people

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
and

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
they crack wise.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
They can be quite poetic sometimes

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
and they're called the boringness of golf

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
that can be.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
And there were these guys that spilled out

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Sergio for Sergio Garcia

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
and they all lined up and the guy

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
was making this and whatever

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
it was.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
And the commentators don't say anything.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
They don't justify it.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
They don't get angry at it.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I think that's very classy of them.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
But it has to stop because today

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
in one of the final holes,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
big important putt, millions of dollars in the line

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
and someone goes,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Happy Mother's Day Mom!

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Toledo IRS!

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
So you're saying

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
that's organized religion.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
The average IQ is dumb.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
The average...

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
You get any giant group of strangers.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
The average IQ are the people that

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
work for Earthlink or for AT&T

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
and you're like...

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
That's why customer service is so infuriating

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
because they're not the smartest people in society

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
doing that. And you have to remember

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
that the people that run around

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
and want to stand too close to Tiger's ball

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
and be an asshole and be in the way and yell that

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
those are regular people

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
and they have smooth parts of their brain

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
and...

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
There should be some nooks and crannies in there.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
And so we end up being elitist

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
anyway.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
And so...

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
We could be elitist and compassionate.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I don't think people are dumb.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I think in some ways truth is public opinion.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
And so if you're surrounded by people

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
who are all saying the same thing

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
it's something you don't really question.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
So if you're wearing khakis and you run by all these guys

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
and this is just what we do.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
When they're on their own they might be smart

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
but when they're all together they're like

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
yeah get in the ball, get in the hole

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
or whatever they're fucking yell

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
it becomes the thing to do.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
And that's how like an array and religion

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
and all of that.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
The problem with getting the hole is

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and I thought about it, I was like say something else

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
but the thing is what else would you say?

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I have a dream!

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
That is the fastest way to say it.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I hope you make that fun.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Yeah they should have Martin Luther King quotes

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I'll tell you what your country can do for you!

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I was thinking there was another...

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
If voting was powerful it would be illegal!

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
A few years ago there was a school

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
this was going back a little bit to that

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
they had a creation science fair

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
where all the projects had to support

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
creationism or disprove evolution

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
the girl who came in first place

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
She had a frog in a tank

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and she said it's not a lizard yet

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Not so different!

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
She took her glass jar

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
put sand and rocks inside

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
and put it in a cupboard, pulled it out

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
a week later nothing had evolved

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
so evolution disproved

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
But I would have been so awesome

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
if she pulled it out and there was like a tiny giraffe

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
in there you know

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
And one day science will put

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
that tiny giraffe there

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
There goes first place

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
I've had time to stew about this very valid

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
thing because I heard myself

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I mean look

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
God damn it

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
We've burnt women at the stake

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
we've drilled holes in people's heads

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
we've done so much has been

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
done wrong by powerful

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
people in the name

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
of religion

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
It's not religion's fault

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
It is powerful people's fault

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
They will abuse

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
anything you give them

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
If you replace religion with science

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
or money, rich old white people

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
are going to burn women at the stake

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
They're going to do it for whatever reason

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
They're going to do it because they hate women

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
and they want to set something on fire

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And the women are all around

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Because how the fuck can you twist

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
a guy walking around

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
saying everyone love each other

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
the wrong way? They figured out how

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
it ended with a McDonald's

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
in Rome

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
with a guy in a funny

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
hat surrounded by gold bowls

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
with

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
different colors smoke coming out of a chimney

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
How do you twist Thomas Jefferson

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
around and end with two parties

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
arguing and having conventions that

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
never existed

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
agreeing on what they're going to debate about

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
what the League of Women voters going

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
you know what we can't moderate this anymore fuck this

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
you guys are insane

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
This is a conspiracy against everyone poor

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
How do you twist that shit around?

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
The answer is because you want to

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
So science

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
is of course

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
it's the best religion we've come up with so far

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
because it's a pursuit

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
to replace the unknown with the known

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
It is just as much

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
as religion should be

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
It's like let's join hands

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
and scour the landscape

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
for this lost child

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
in this Amber Alert

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
called the search for the meaning of life

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I don't care if we find a shoe

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
or a

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
or a blade of grass

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
or a little extra blood on it

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
One set of footprints

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
That is when I was raping you

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
How?

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
You're raping her on foot?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Yeah

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
He works in mysterious ways

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I don't know what we're even talking about

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
anymore

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
That was a metaphor

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
You're a rail pass

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
I was going to say

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
that was when science carried you

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
but you went with rape

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
And God bless me

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I always will

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
The fight

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
of whether or not

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
we're going to be religious or scientific

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
first

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
in a very important sense

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
that fight is already over

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Look at the skyline

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
as Campbell said

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
the tallest buildings were always churches

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
back in the days when they were abusing their power

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
He didn't say that part

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
There was a point where the churches were the big tall buildings

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
That's why churches have that architecture

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
to them because that was

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
state of the art how high can we get this building

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Then by the time

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
we learned how to make buildings taller

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
that money and engineering

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
knowledge was coming not from God

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
but from Fort Knox

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
The buildings that are taller than churches

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
now are commercial buildings

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
and commerce and science

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
has one

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
You only have to look out your window to see that

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
The crosses are lower than the antenna

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
and the

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
NBC logos and the CNNs

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
and the whatever

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
We beat them

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
But

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
are we going to become another church

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Are we going to become

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Are we going to

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
The thing that they created

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
accidentally or on purpose

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
and either forgot

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
or never wanted to know

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
that we all know about

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
has this idea of

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
a moral code

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
the idea that we're important to each other

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
These prophets were

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
popping up 2000 years ago

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
when we were writing literature

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
they had this eruption of

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
okay this guy

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
suddenly became a revolutionary

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
and then he got killed for it

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
this guy said stuff shit

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
all over the globe it was happening

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
roughly at the same time

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
as we were becoming

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
powerful enough to kill each other

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
we weren't taking each other seriously enough

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
we have it within us

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
unconsciously

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
as we start to get more and more crowded together

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
and the guns start to grow

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
on trees and be available

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
in bubblegum machines

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
in us to do stuff with our brains

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
that will make it possible

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
for guns to be available in gum ball machines

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
and nobody to get hurt

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
less people than you'd think

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
for the lights to go out in New York for a whole night

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
and nobody gets hurt the ice cream just melts

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
and they eat it together

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
for wonderful things to happen

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
no matter how little opinion we give

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
we have of ourselves

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
we've achieved

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
magnificent things

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
both because science continues

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
to prove maniacs wrong

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
but also because

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
as that happens human beings

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
continue to reveal themselves

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
to have the power to police themselves

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
the monster inside of us

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
and

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
when the guys in the lab coats

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
come out and they go

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
okay I just figured it out

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
what happened

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
0.00003 seconds

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
after the universe was created

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
we now know

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
that a Zedron made of Hebron

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
that guy

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
his job is to focus on that stuff

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
really hard

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
to the exclusion probably

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
have a lot of thought about whether or not

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
we should hit each other in the face

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
over a game of checkers

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
that guy might be a great person

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
he might be a terrible person

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
personality wise

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
his brain is given over to

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
forging into that unknown territory

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
and reporting back to us

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
what happens to a Parsec when it becomes a Quibon

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
or whatever

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
we in the mainstream

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
smart or stupid

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
relative to that guy

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
when we hear that a Quizon is actually a Hebon

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
we

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
we

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
we have to

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
we have to be good people still

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
because the more

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
we get rid of God

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
the more we shove that stuff aside

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
the more we actually

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
need to supplant it with some kind of

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
code

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
some kind of culture

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
it's already been laid out for us

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Roddenberry that's why he was so

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
impacting because he saw it

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
and he saw

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
the Vulcan mythology

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
where they were related to Romulans

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
and they became like

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
super intelligent

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
and able to destroy themselves and made a memetic decision

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
to evolve

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
so we got to go with logic now

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
and logic says don't punch someone in the face

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
just because

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
you think he likes your girlfriend

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
or because you want more oil

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
or logic

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
make a decision about the species

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
and blah blah blah

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
we know that science is supposed to be

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
get this higher state of being

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
but right now we're caught in this puberty

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
where science is only making us beat up our dad

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
on prom night

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
we're just being a little bit destructive I think

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
we have to work it out a little bit

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
don't you think there's like a churchification

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
of science going on though

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
because like I feel that there's

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
that's what I'm worried about

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
that's happening like that's the thing

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
and look this paleontologist was doing

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
the choir boy molestation

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
of creating dinosaurs

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
he was making them up

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
I would say not as bad but continue

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
it happens like there's people

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
that won't listen to evidence

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
because they just assume

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
like assume that a

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
given principle is just law

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
and unchangeable and rather than like

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
go back and look at evidence

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
they're like no this is what I know

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
this is my bible so I'm not going to question it

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
but that's the whole point of science

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
there's a ton of oh yeah within their ranks

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
thank god science is intelligent enough

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
to have as its code

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
has peer review

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
and skepticism like baked into it

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
there are these dogmatic

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
old men who make it hard on the young men

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
coming up young young women

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
who

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
it's too late for me

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
make your own lightsaber and move on

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
throw me in the pit

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
and watch me shoot lightning as I die

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
but

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
there's always going to be an old boys club

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
that's always like even

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
especially anthropology where it's like

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
you have to dig up a bone

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
to prove something and then in the meantime

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
it's all these theories and like Elaine Morgan

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
one of my heroes who created the aquatic ape

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
theory was like bullied by

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
blah blah blah a different episode

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
the uh

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
but take a step back from that now

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
if you're willing to look at that and say

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
okay scientist A

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
is kind of a dick to scientist C

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
within

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
their community because scientist C

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
hasn't paid his dues and

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
you know this theory's got traction

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
and people don't want it to be true and don't want to take

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
new hypotheses seriously

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
now you take a step back from that

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
and look at how science

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
is that condescending

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
to someone with an IQ over

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
75 who happens to

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
choose to have a relationship

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
with the unknown an umbilical

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
point coming out of their forebrain

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
and into the into the void

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
to comfort them

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
in the face of all this chaos

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
to personify

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
as is not only our right but

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
fuck our instinct

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
as these chatterbox primates

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
we creating religion

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
comes as naturally to us

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
as I've said pooping

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
and there's a lot of poop that needs to be

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
flushed away but thank god we look

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
at it sometimes

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
in case there's blood in it and we go to the doctor

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
it's coming

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
out of us religion is coming

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
out of us and you just take a look

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
at it every time you blow your nose

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
are you saying religion is like bloody poop

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
there's blood in this shit

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
bad religion there might also

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
also once in a while be

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
a nugget of gold in your poop

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
not as often

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
maybe the metaphor doesn't work

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
human beings create a lot of

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
things that are easily dismissible

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
because they happen so naturally

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
the fact that I'm talking I mean

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
it's amazing people like

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
we've written language written languages

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
it's a medic thing it's like babies just at two years

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
old just go hey give me a glass of water

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
whoa what the fuck

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
that's genetic that's

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
like an actual happening

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
like we're like weird macaws

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
we just start talking it's crazy

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
and when we do we start

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
like cognifying differently we start

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
recognizing like how to make

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
maps and shit that we wouldn't understand if we didn't have

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
language what a podcast

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
they say like

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
people who speak different languages different grammatical

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
structures approach problem solving

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
differences so it really does sort of feed

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
into each other because I can choose to say that

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
you're sitting on top of the box or that the box

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
has you on top of it

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
what do you think of it the language is absolutely

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
thought and literally when you're speaking

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
a different language is different parts of your brain are

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
going so it's like the pathways

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
are different I could feel it if I want

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
to switch to Urdu that my brain works

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
slightly differently when I switch back it like

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
takes me a second to lock back into it

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
that's what they say about Urdu

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
you never go back

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
once you go or do you never go back

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
yeah that's what I was trying to

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
in Urdu you say if you

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
go back you never Urdu

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
see that's why that's the thing

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
it's a beautiful language

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
and by the way

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
beautiful

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
put a big fat asterisk on the idea

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
some of my favorite operas are Urdu

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
the fact that language is thought

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
the fact that we think

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
as we speak and that the words

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
we say are actually

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
the pathways of our brain

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
that is a lot different from saying that

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
certain specific words are

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
magical and need to be either

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
celebrated or buried

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
that's dumb

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
like there's no

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
smart way to approach that

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
but I do think words do have meaning

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
you were saying that earlier and people do use

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
words differently to oppress or further

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
a certain thing there's a reason

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
it's called pro-choice and pro-life and not

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
pro-abortion and you know so these words

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
do have certain and that's what the Nazis did a lot

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
instead of calling it when they kill all the Jews

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
it was the final solution

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
and when they had the Jews sort of

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
running the camps that was called joy division

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
so those words

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
they're not just words they can

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
sort of be used to

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
have people thinking a certain way

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
and when you have a cold there's snot on your face

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
but an anti snot campaign

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
is not going to come up with the cure

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
it is just you know just keep wiping

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
and whatever I guess that's better than

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
letting it sit on your face

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
that's a social

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
custom don't put your elbows on the table

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
don't say the n-word around black people

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
you know why?

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
here's why I don't do it

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I think I know why

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
well I'm going to tell you anyway

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
here's why I stopped doing it

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
from when I was like 25 and I was like I'll punk rock

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
I'm like you're not going to book it

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
like Quentin Tarantino said once and I do agree

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
with this fundamentally when a word has that much power

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
you should be screaming it from the rooftops

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
he's right I mean in the way

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
that you should be right he's right

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
but you're not going to get that

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
it's always going to be used in a certain way

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
no, no, no, no, no

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
here's why I say the n-word

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
instead of actually saying the n-word

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
it's for the same reason I don't say the c-word

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
like as often

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
as I might

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
one, two?

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
when I'm driving inside my car

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
everybody's a cunt

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I'm a cunt, that old lady's a cunt

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
the dog is a cunt

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
when I'm kissing my girlfriend

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
goodbye to go to work in the morning

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
she's an n-word

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
n-word privately

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
between me and my girlfriend

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
that word is like fucking amazing

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
it's like saying like sugar pie

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
yeah, I love it

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
and I love it

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
because I'm not supposed to

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
so it's tender and delicious

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
and wonderful in your mouth

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
like a piece of fucking bacon

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
tough titties for the people who made it

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
that flavorful

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
on all sides of the issue

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
in the end I'm a guy inside my house

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
with all the ways to be impacting to myself

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
the reason I don't say

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
n-word and cunt

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
the reason I don't say it

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
around other people

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
in mixed companies

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
is because of the social

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
social pressure

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I'm rolling my eyes

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
at the dumb-dot connection

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
there's social anxiety

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
and pressure that it puts people on

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
for the same reason I cover my mouth

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
when I sneeze

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
or say bless you when someone else sneezes

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I don't want to deal with it

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
that's why I don't

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I don't want to make other people deal with it

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
that's called politeness

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
it has nothing to do with fixing society

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
but like in your house

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
that word is powerless

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
it means nothing, you're screaming it from the rooftops

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
there's nothing negative about that word

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
but when you say it in public there is a connotation to it

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
that you can't control

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
that word's out there

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
but I can easily say it without the connotation

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Louis C.K. and every great comic

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
has had a whole ten minute bit

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
that relieves the pressure, thank god

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I could be one of those people

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I could come out and say the n-word

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
and everybody would be laughing

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
the black people would have to deal with people glancing at them

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
even if they didn't

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I'm too lazy

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
to make anyone deal with that

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I don't want to do it

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
that tree can be cut down by a different lumberjack

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
or

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
me, I'll stick to metaphoric crafted

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
that's my bread and butter

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
the only point I'm making

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
is that

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
when we get bogged down on the technical aspect

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
of whether or not the words have power

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
then the answer, we both agree that the word

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
look at the word, look at the powerful word

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
it has power, but then there's subsets

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
of that topic and you go

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
the power doesn't

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
mean, it's like the snot has power

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
when you have a cold

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
you could scrape it, put it in a jar

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
and centrifuge it and find out

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
what kind of cold you have

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
there's all kinds of things you could do with the snot

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
you cannot cure the cold

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
by

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
inventing something that makes the snot go away

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
by making snot illegal

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
the person's

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
immune system is being impacted

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
their body is generating

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
shit in their body

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and the end result is there's some snot

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
coming out of their nose

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
we're communicating with each other

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
and there's a word that thank god

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
there's a word

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
that is a tendril to

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
all of this legacy

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
if there weren't a word, holy shit

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
there ain't no word for the fact

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
that we killed a bunch of Indians

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
because it matters less

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
we don't have a fucking word to dance

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
around and be polite about

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
we just did it and moved on

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
but I do think

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
words do affect

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
it's not just that

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
the word is a symptom of an ill

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
or whatever, the way your thing is not cold

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I also do think

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
words can affect

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
the way a person thinks

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
and feels about something

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
if they say it

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
if they say it and their intent

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
is, yeah

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
you reveal through your language whether you give a shit

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
whether the person next to you is a human being

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
you know, but just also like

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
going back to just saying pro-life

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
that sounds very positive and if you keep saying that

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
pro-life, pro-life, pro-life

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
it sort of affects how you think about that issue

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
whereas if you're saying pro-choice

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
then it's something else

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I really do think words can affect

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
the way people think about certain things

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
and if you

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
read stuff about what happened in concentration camps

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
they changed what words mean

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and they changed the way people thought

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
that's the first thing they do

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
that

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
that is the way you

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
recognize fascism

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
is people who are

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
like running for media and language

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
that's the place they go

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
because the weak

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
and the busy, the overworked

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
and the tired and the desperate

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
only have language to connect

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
to other people through and media

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
and so people who find themselves in positions

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
of moderate power, they run

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
to the tallest buildings with the dishes on them

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
and they start tweaking

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
the way we're communicating with those people

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
they make sure that we're obsessed with race

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
they make sure that the 99%

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
think of themselves as

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
50% black and 85% this

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
instead of

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
just a big simple number

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
they tweak the language that way

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
and that's what's dangerous because the people

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
that are dividing us

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
are speaking pro-life

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
and pro-choice, the people dividing us

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
are speaking

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
and word is magical

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
there is a conspiracy

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
among

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
the dunces to divide us

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
and

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I don't know, let's settle this in a

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
no, that makes sense to me

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
at another time, I'm very suspicious

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
are we going to settle it?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I guarantee it, because I talk too much about black widows

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
if we started from the top of the show

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
okay, are black widows

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
poisonous or no?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
are they like white people?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
no, black widows

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
to answer that question, which is more important

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
they are, but their mandibles can't pierce human skin

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
they can't deliver the payload

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
no one laughed at that, again

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
making me think that you actually think I'm racist

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I'm not an editor

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
but there's an easy way to make this

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
sound like you're a racist that wants to be back on community

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I'm a very special fifth season

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
and you're misogynistic

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
it's stand-up raping

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
and n-bombs

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
it may not be far from the truth

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
it's not going to take a lot of editing either

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
just a couple snips

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
at this point in my life, I'm only a product

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
of what other people think about me

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
so if I make an awesome callback

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
spider black person joke like that

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I'm with you

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I'm with you

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I'm with you

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I'm with you

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
there's silence in the room because they're like

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
man, he really is racist

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
it's like, holy shit, we have to

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
if a third person causes you a horse, it's as you buy a saddle

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
well, I think it's different

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I don't think it was people getting uncomfortable

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I think when you start, when you go into a certain

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
field, like when you're about to

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
clearly make a black joke

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
it has to be finally crafted

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
it was! that was amazing

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I don't think it was

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
the jaddy long legs in the play

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
black people poison us, yes

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
but their mandibles can't

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I thought that was great

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
they still disagree

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I know!

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
not on board

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I'm with you

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
if it had been an hilarious joke

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
that would have overridden

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
people's naturalist

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
that's the thing, if you're doing a standup bit about

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
the N word, which is why Louis C. K. can do it

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
because it's the best

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
bit about that word

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
it can't be the fucking best bit

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
you know, it can't be like

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
no, no, no, but I'm not saying

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I'm the guy who's on your side

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
with the black people mandible piercing joke

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
how would you say that

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
in Urdu?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
in Russia

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
mandible, you pierce

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
mandible

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
so you don't actually speak Urdu, do you?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
yeah, this is just

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
a tan and a speech impediment

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I knew it

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I fucking knew it

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
it's the world's best kept secret

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I need no language

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
my name is Chris Mail

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
alright

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I need a female from the audience

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
who can tell us

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
in five minutes about

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
the worst conversation

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
with their mother for Mother's Day

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
that's willing to share it with the podcast audience

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
your reward is

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
you get to play Aaron's character in D&D

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
she had a very deep

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
brown when she raised her hand

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
but it doesn't sound like a good story

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
it's okay if it's bad for some tragic reason

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
it doesn't have to be a finely crafted comedic thing

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
what's your name?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
hold on, give my heart a second

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I feel good

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
take it all the time

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
you won

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I'm Denise Hay, guys

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
hi, I'm Camille

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Chris, nice to meet you

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I know who you are

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
it would be weird if you didn't

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and you were here

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
what's your name? Denise

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I love that you speak Urdu

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
by the way

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
and English, do you speak any other languages?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
well, I could say Hindi but it's spoken the same as Urdu

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
but I could say

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
now I feel bad about only speaking two languages

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
do you speak multiple languages?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
yeah, I do too

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
which ones? German, Farsi

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
and English

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Farsi, nice

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
that's nice, really

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Denise, can I ask you

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I had a crush on a Persian girl

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
when I was in high school or college

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
of course you did

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
they're beautiful

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
are you Persian?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
yes

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
if only you hadn't said the C word so many times

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
it's only when I'm driving

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
if only they weren't so hairy

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I didn't say

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I didn't say

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
it's hairy like Bill's jerky

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
sorry

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Bill, we're together

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
is it true or not true that the word for popcorn is elephant farts?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
yes, it is

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
they call popcorn elephant farts, which is adorable

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
it's gross, what?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
wait, can I have some salty elephant farts?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
how does it make you...

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
is it a string of syllables that sounds like the English words elephant farts?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
or are you saying that the colloquial term

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
is elephant farts?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
it's like going

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
and ordering a burger and saying

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
can I have some diarrhea on a bun

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
burrito is like a little

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
it's a little patnual

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
elephant farts

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
that's what an elephant fart would look like

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I like that

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I would eat them

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
what's the word, what do you call it?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
can you say it?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
choice of feel

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
choice means fart

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
it means elephant

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
okay, now let me ask you one more

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
is it true, if I say

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
the name of the country

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Costa Rica

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
oh my god, yes

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
you just insulted her uncle

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
you're totally legit

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
no, you are obsessed with cunts

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
which I understand

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I might have

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
put that more delicately

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I will listen to you say it a couple more times

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I know, I'm weirdly into it

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
it's like having a gangster rapper

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
up here

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
now say the N word for it

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
well no, it's not her

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I grew up in Germany and they called me

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
sand nigger my entire childhood

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
alright, so that's how she can do it

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
as long as she says the word sand before it

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
you and I can say it, it's a bubble

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
sand room, I can do it

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
what's up my sand room

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
tell them what Costa Rica is

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Costa Rica means

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
your cunt smelt

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
hey, does cus, is that pussy?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
yeah, cus means pussy

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
guys nodding, are you Persian?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
oh, okay, you're like yeah

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
he's just an Israeli pussy

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
there's actually a

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
that's the

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
on the license plate for Costa Rica

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Costa Rica, and then on the bottom

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
it says means your

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
means your pussy smells in Farsi

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
but cus means pussy

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
and it is for lovers

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
yeah, cus means pussy

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
languages are connected

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
the multilingual thing always bumps me out

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I always have a pang of guilt

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
at 40 I'll never know, I'll never fluently speak more than one language

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
we were just talking about how language

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
is thought

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
doesn't it seem pretty obvious

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
that if we actually

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
the more people

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
that spoke multiple languages

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
the more generally

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
mellow and smarter we'd be

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
because that is the practice

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
of being able to

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
switch gears

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
and have two points

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
of cognating

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
that's the third language I'll make

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
it also

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
it also brings people together

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
I think because I've noticed

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
whenever you see a movie, the bad guys

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
when they speak

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Arabic or whatever

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
it's rarely translated

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
oh, they're gibberish, they're the other

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
but I was watching this movie

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
and this movie was terrorist

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
and the terrorist spoke and it was translated

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
and I was like wow, that's weird

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
and it turns out he was a good guy

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
so that's like an interesting thing

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I think it's sort of lack of

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
language divides people

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
lack of knowing what the other...

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Denise, what is your Mother's Day

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
tale for us? Oh shit, I was a great

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
to forgot about it

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
great calm trolling by the way

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
we could stick to this

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
that's why I was nervous

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
one more thing I wanted to say about

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
language actually

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
one of my fascinations

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
is the way people say

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
cock-a-doodle-doo or how to say bubbles

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
in different languages

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
where is it a kind of onomatopoeia

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
you want to know what chickens say in Farsi?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
what's cock-a-doodle-doo in Farsi?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
what's the sound of chicken?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
really, you're going to make me say it

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
it's so embarrassing

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
more than cock-a-doodle-doo?

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I'd rather say

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
coast-a-doodle-coast

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
no

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
it's like

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
it's so weird

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
it's like drunk rooster

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
it sounds like

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Joan Crawford as a rooster

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
coming into your room at 3 in the morning

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
it sounds like

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Barbara Streisand got raped by camel

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
and somehow it's just like

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
oh now we're talking

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
what a horrible language

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I guess that's what the hump means

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I'm sorry

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
there was only one set of hoofs

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
wait for it

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
say it one more time and picture Barbara Streisand

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
say it one more time

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
so do you want to hear about my mom?

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I want to hear about America's mom

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Barbara Streisand

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
just one more time

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
just everyone picture Barbara Streisand in the guilt trip

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
with Seth Rogen

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
and a camel

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
just say it

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
what?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
the camel's not into it

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
that was consensual

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
we don't want to

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
I felt bad for the camel

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Seth Rogen's the camel

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
he's doing great

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
what's your mother's day story

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Denise?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I moved here after high school

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
can I have one more question?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
sorry

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
you're Iranian and your name's Denise?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
are you Christian?

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
no I'm actually

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I'm Muslim and Jewish

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
and I was raised by

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
this is an option?

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
unfortunately

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
if vanilla and chocolate

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
hated each other

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
and then I was raised by Germans in Germany

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
we're just fucked up

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
if you think about it

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
so my mom still lives in Germany

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
do your parents have the house divided

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
and there's a fight in the

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
yeah well Jews sleep

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
in the closet of course

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
not the attic

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
but I called her

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
as somebody who is part Jewish

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
part Muslim I do think it's interesting

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
that your metaphor for the sound of Rooster makes

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
tracer than a camel

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
I don't like that camel Muslim connection

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
what is that?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
you're a tan guy with a speech impediment

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
shut up

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I'm standing up for the people I resemble

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
but I'm not of

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:30.000
sorry, your mom's story?

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I'm not saying the show is long and farsi

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
go ahead Denise

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
so I called her and I was like mom

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
thanks for raising me

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
basically on your own

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
she was like well did you think about

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
what's going to happen with me when I'm old

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
because you're in America

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
so if your stepdad dies

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
what the fuck is going to happen with me

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I was like that's a downer

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
total bummer

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I just called to say hey

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
thank you for everything

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
and she was like I'm going to die alone

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
because you're my only child and you're over there

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Denise are you looking young enough

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
that I'm allowed to ask how old you are?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
no you're not

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I'm not that old

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
but I want to be able to lie about it in five years

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
okay

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
that's great LA of you

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
banking

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
but I'm still on the very good side

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I'm 24 now but I want to be 24 in five years

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
exactly

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
I want to be 26

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
forever

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
oh so you're 26

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
the reason I wanted to ask is

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
because I'm 40 and I live in constant dread

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I still feel like a baby

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
and my relationship with my parents

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
is emotionally touch and go meaning

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
not touch and go like I love them

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I hate them

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I was supposed to have kids a long time ago

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
and also now

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I'm at that era where

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
according to American tradition

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
if nothing else

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
my parents are

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
what do you do do you knock on wood

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
what am I about to say

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
I'm explaining a thought in my head

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
and the whole does

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I'm sorry

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
this is just the way

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
your thought works

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
please honor my candor

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I'm just thinking in my head

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I'm 40 and my parents are 20 years older than me

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
and more and aren't going to start getting

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
sick soon and when they do

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
what are my obligations to them

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
and how is that going to work

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
because we don't

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
my family has always been just very reptilian

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
it's like

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I don't know

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
what am I supposed to do

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
what do I want to do

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
you just send them money

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
to be able to live

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
through the

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
but her mom

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I can't even visit my mom

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
if I was you I'd be flying there

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
just with my own whatever

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
is your mom in Iran

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
she's in Germany

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I would argue with you guys at this point

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I'm not that rich but

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
this is a great season television show

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I could probably

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
forge some air hoses for the parents

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
my mom didn't know what the fuck mother's there was

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
five years ago and now she's

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
super offended if I don't call her

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
first world problems

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
she's super

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I knew it now

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
super I knew it

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
super Hindu it

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
no don't clap stop

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
stop no don't clap

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
stop it

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
get out

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
yeah don't rebound buddy

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
you can't make

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Muslim and Hindu jokes about my parents

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I think you'll find I can and do

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
that was a real hidden don't

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
alright let's play some D&D

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
shall we everybody

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
tenise stay tenise please stay

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
you're going to play

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.000
character. She's at home with a cold. She's never done D&D before, so you have to explain

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
all of them.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I played D&D before. I actually was a drow, so no worries. I just want to know what her

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
character...

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Fuck everybody that says girls don't play D&D. Fuck you and your mom.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
No, they do. They just...

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
They do.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
It's just like that.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Not all suck at it. I'm going to kick your ass.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000
It's just that post-character generating shopping trip always ends up in...

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Adam said, told me to kill your character and rape it.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Okay. Oh, his character.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Yeah.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
We're already dead anyway. We almost died last time.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Great job, Denise.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Did you hear last week's episode, Denise?

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I did not. I was at a bot mitzvah scene.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Well, it ended with all of us being apparently choked to death by shadow monsters.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Like, for those of you listening...

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Oh, he's going to recap it for us, right?

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I often do.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I have to say, I wasn't here, and miraculously, even though it kept being brought up, nobody

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
fucked my character last week.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
We didn't get to.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Because we were all dying.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I know.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And sex was not on our minds.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
It still kind of was.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I sort of floated it. Nobody seemed into it.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000
So I was like, all right.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
All right, so yeah, so we were hanging by a thread.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Dan, you want to go grab the character sheet so we'll get this bitch kitty underway?

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Yeah. Do you have the...

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Did you bring the music cues back?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Yes, I do. I have the music.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Spencer, are you ready to get us up to date?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I'd like to think so.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
All right. Spencer, everybody.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:33.000
After a confusing episode with a possessed Chris de Burgh and a brief return of Tylenol with Codine,

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
as well as a dangerous brush with a large black gate,

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
our heroes were accosted by a troop of blade-armed horrors.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
At first, the gang was winning, cutting down two of the shadowy foes in an instant.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Soon after, however, the tides of battle shifted and the shadows tried a new tactic,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
choking out the opponents with their smoky and substantial forms.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
As combat wore on, two more shadows were defeated,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
but Mulraine and Sharpie were caught by the limbs,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
dimming their minds and dulling their senses as it choked them to death.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
After trying to avoid the grappling shadows, Mulraine fired some arrows wildly

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
before passing out from suffocation.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Sharpie slung fiery bolts at the shadows and managed to heal the party with the Soul of Growth,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
but in the end was also overcome by the shadowy smoke.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Two losing consciousness.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.000
The remaining shadows squared off against Quark and Chris, who fucked around too much,

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
trying to pull crazy tricks that failed utterly.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000
They too were choked out and lost consciousness in short order.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
The party fly defeated on the floor,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
and as their unconscious forms were dragged into the black gate by the shadowy assailants,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
who would know how they would get to their home?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Yeah, so I fucked that one up.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Can't hit every audio cue.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
This podcast is brought to you by...

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Nabisco!

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Thank you, Spetha.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Put a cookie on it.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I knew I'd have to fail at something.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Nabisco, which in Urdu means, your mom has a cock.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Yeah.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:18.000
The best is cock, co is mother.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Sometimes that's all there is, you know.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
There's nothing more to be said than what's already been said.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Sometimes you have a punchline, sometimes you just stop talking.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Just pull the record and just let the shoot deploy, man.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
You guys are on your own.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Exactly.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Speaking of on our own, so I'm gonna imagine that we need to be told what the hell's going on.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Yeah, you guys aren't even awake yet.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
It's crazy.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Anyway.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
We all black out, right?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Yeah, no, you're dead now.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Reroll characters.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Let's go.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Wait, we're dead?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
No.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I knew it.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I had a feeling this was like in a video game,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
like when you have no choice and just lose all your equipment,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
someone hits you on the head.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Close, yeah, yeah.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Your eyes slowly drift open, a dry burning,

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
clawing at your lids and your throat and your body throbs with pain.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
You can feel a heavy burden weighing on your neck,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
shoulders, wrists, ankles, knees and toes.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
You look down.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Knees and toes, knees and toes.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Head, ankles, knees and toes, knees and toes.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
What's that in throbbing pain?

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Our pelvises?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.000
No, the mentioned body parts are weighed down by burdens,

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
which looking down you see are in fact shadowy chains

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
binding your arms and legs to those of your adventurer friends,

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
like some sort of chained gang.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
So we're all chained together?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Yeah, you're chained and guarded by multiple,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
I'd say nine of these same blade-armed guards.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Your chains are bound to a black wall that extends

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
easily about 300 feet tall or more.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And it's creating a huge ring-shaped arena,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
sort of doughnut.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Arena?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Inside this doughnut, yeah.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
And are we all together or are we in different parts of the world?

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
You guys are chained to each other, so you're pretty close.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
You know you're maybe in like an eight-foot train.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
So we're at the edge of a circular wall

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
that goes 300 feet in the air.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And it's a doughnut.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Atop the far walls you can see tiered steps of ashy stone grey rings

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
like some sort of amphitheater or stadium.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Packed into the stepped rows of grey risers are thousands upon

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000
thousands of silhouettes, forming a massive crowd of pulsing,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
undulating dragons.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I don't like this trope, yeah.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000
It's a classic.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
There's a reason it's a trope, Dan.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Yeah, because it pits the protagonist in a horrible situation

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
that I'm going to fail at.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Are they going to make us go like Spock against Kirk in this?

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Who knows?

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I kill myself instantly.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
That's a fair action.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Do you want to do that?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
No.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
But if we're going to be in a human centipede at any point,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I call the front.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I got middle. I got middle.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
A lot of people don't know last, second to last is actually

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
for various biological and toxicological reasons.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
It's the same as being on Space Mountain, second to last.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
They call it the human centipede catbird seed.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
It actually results in you being pretty healthy after three weeks

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
if you get cut loose.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
There's a human centipede sequel, and there's a guy,

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
the sequel is about a guy who saw a human centipede

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
and wants to try it on his own.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
And then there's a scene where he has everybody in a warehouse

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
and then he walks out of the room,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
and I think it's the first dialogue in the movie.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
A guy who heard a reference to human centipede goes like,

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000
it's from a movie. Did you see it?

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
The human centipede.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
He's going to sew us ass to mouth.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
And everyone starts going,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
ahhh.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Like, I would, if I had to,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
he's going to sew us ass to mouth.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I wouldn't have an immediate visceral reaction to that

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
the way I would.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
He's going to pull out our fingernails

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
or he's going to eat our livers.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
He's going to sew us ass to mouth.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I'd be like, wait, what? What?

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
But maybe they've seen the first movie.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Yeah, I mean, I think that's the crime

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
is it's pretty simple.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Everyone saw the movie and they're like,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
no, ass to mouth, I heard about that.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Oh.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
It's like the McDonald's Monopoly game.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
That's why I didn't like the movie Predators,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
you know, the new Predators,

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
because they reference the first movie, not as a movie,

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
but they say, oh, you know what he did

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
and then he covered himself in mud,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
and that's how-

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Like it really happened, like they read it in the Tribune?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Yeah.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
They were like, remember that happened

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
in the Predators, they do the same thing.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
So these guys can like have invisibility cloaks

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
and like homing lasers,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
but they can't figure out,

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
if you cover yourself in mud, they're flabbergasted.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Yeah, they don't have mud, mud, mud, mud.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
They should just have like a water hose on their stove.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
They should just outlaw mud.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
All right, so what's up, Spencer?

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
So I mentioned there's these nine guys guarding you.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Yeah, I totally did.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
They're looking into the center of this donut

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000
and there's even a smaller, like a central raised ring,

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
like a stage, kind of situated in the middle.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
And you can see hanging above the stage

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
is that massive glowing gray sun

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
that actually caused your shadows

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
to depart in the first place,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
hanging above the central ring.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
And chained in the central ring,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
you can see a guy, it looks a lot like Breffi.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Oh.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Hey, I have to go pee, guys.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I'll be right back.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I'll be right back.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Yeah, no, for real.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000
What happens?

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Like in a medicine.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
That would be a terrible joke if that were a joke.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Yeah, no, go ahead.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
No, it's my life.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
This is my life.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
It happens.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
It's a serious business.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Yeah.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
We're on our own.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Yeah, there's an old Farsi saying about bladder size.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Yeah.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I only know the English translation.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
How does it translate?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:15.000
His Black Widow does not catch flies.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I didn't want to follow it through.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Honestly, my relationship with all of you

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
ended that second time I said something

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
that I think deserved a bigger laugh than I got.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
And I started to think to myself,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I'm just going to edit you laughing in.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I'm just going to pick something else.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I can't remember what it was.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
It's called fascism.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Yeah, and I'm going to edit that boo out,

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
that guy that booed me.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
There's nothing you can do that I can't manipulate

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
and control.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
All right, so we're chained together.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
There's nine guards.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
There's an arena that we're in,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
then there's a stage in front of us.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Above it is the glowing sun.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Uh-huh, and below it is a Breffi lookalike.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
A Breffi lookalike.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Chained to the arena there.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Remind me of who Breffi was.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
He was the guy that turned into a...

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
a frightened old man,

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
very pale with long white hair,

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
you know, rather spindly guy

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
that occasionally turns into a large spidery monster.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I'd call out and say, are you Breffi?

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
He can't hear you.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I bet it's like a human form,

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
like if you and I existed in a place

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
where we had to look like spiders,

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
like we would look like the same spider.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Did you ever see the arrival with Charlie Sheen?

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
No.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
He kept seeing Ron Silver everywhere.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And then he realized that the aliens

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
only make so many rubber suits.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Ah.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
You know, Mattel only issues out so many human costumes.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I yell out, have you seen the movie Arrival?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
He can't hear you.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Okay.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Are the guards...

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
In fact, everything's eerily silent,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
like normally if you're packed in a stadium

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
or something, there'd be some noises, but in case...

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Well, it's hard to clap when your hands are shadows.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Tell me about it.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Don't force time at no laugh.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And it's all going in my memoirs.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Are the guards watching us?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
The guards, as it happens, are watching the central stage.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
They're looking at this chained man.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
He looks around and framed.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Can I summon the monkey and have him free my shackles?

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
The monkey summon is only like once per day.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I guess you don't know that it's the same day,

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
but you feel as if you can't cast any more spells.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I was passed out. How long was I passed out?

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Not eight hours.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Also, you haven't done the magic.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Do we have our inventory with us, or has it all been taken away from us?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
That's a great question.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Fumbling around.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
You do notice you have your bags and things with you.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Okay.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Yeah.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Yeah, crazy.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
All of a sudden, the mood seems to shift,

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
and you see the breathy lookalike.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.000
His neck snaps to the left as if he's suddenly transfixed by something.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Yeah, yeah. Following his gaze,

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
you can see a black shadow streaking across the gray floor

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
of the stadium towards the old gray man.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
This is where we watch the guy in front of us.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Yeah, get it.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Yeah.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I said it.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
That happens.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Do you want to guess what happens next?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Hey, don't punish our savvy.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
That's exactly what you do in Dungeons & Dragons.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
You punish metagaming.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
That's a whole thing.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Well, then I'll just sit here and go like,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
ooh, wow, what's going to happen?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000
And get rewarded for it?

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
That's all I ever wanted.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:42.000
That path ends with fake brontosaurus.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I'll just go where the heat is.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Yeah, that's fine. You do you, Dan. You do you.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
I'll be good cop, okay?

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Oh my God, what's going to happen?

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
I'm so glad you asked.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I jibber in feudal anguish.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000
I make the far-thee chicken sound.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Well, we got to figure out how to,

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
we got the time it takes for this breathy guy to die

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000
until we figure out what the fuck we're going to do.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
That's why I don't like this. I'm bad at chess.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I don't like the pressure.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I use all my barbarian strength to rail against my chains

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
to see if that does anything.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
You struggle with all your might,

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
but these chains are even stronger than I am.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Can I ask, as a sidebar, my spell situation,

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
like, or, you know, I was so exhausted

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
before I only had levels like one and two.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I haven't, nothing's changed about that.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Yeah, you still haven't gotten any spells back.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Holy Toledo.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
You notice the chains around breathy dissolving,

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
if I haven't mentioned that before,

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
and testing his arms and legs,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000
he kind of stretches a little bit as the shadow approaches.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
You can see the shadow, it kind of looks like a black spider.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
It's got many limbs, and as it approaches the ring,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
you see breathy shape shift himself.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Well, breathy look alike.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
He's not breathy, you guys, spoilers.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Anyway, he turns into a great white spider,

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
and the two clash.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
There are many black and white limbs

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
and starling and tangling each other.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
You can only hear the sound of ripping flesh

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
and tearing limbs from limbs

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
against the dark backdrop,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
or the quiet backdrop of the, you know, the background.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Done with that sense.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Maybe this fight will be a hit,

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
and they'll push us to mid-season.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000
It'll get 13 more episodes.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Yeah.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
So the lifeless corpse of the breathy look like

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
falls to the ground,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
and you can see the black spidery shadow

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
rise up in triumph, and as it happens,

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000
the gray sun gives out a brilliant pulse,

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000
and then breathy look alike is dissolved into light,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
and it dissolves into light

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
and flows into the black spidery creature.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
The black spidery creature walks off to the arena in triumph

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
and takes a place in the stands.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
What is this?

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Oh, Jesus, the audience gets to just kill people?

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Yeah, what do they do?

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
What is the audience doing now?

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
The audience is going nuts.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Get in the hole! Get in the hole!

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Get in the hole! Get in the hole!

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Get in the hole!

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Get in the hole!

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Get in the hole!

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Especially because of any more...

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Happy Mother's Day!

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
They were quiet.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
This crowd was a quiet crowd in my narration.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Yeah, that was very clear.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
No, yeah, well they...

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
I'm sure, though, from their perspective

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000
they're doing that.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I mean, the crowd, yeah, whatever.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Why am I siding with anyone but you?

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
What's up, y'all?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Do the shadow shackles react to any kind of light?

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Okay, so other than light,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
you guys can see in the darkness that it's just Sharpie,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
so he can barely see,

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
but there's not really any light.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
The only thing that could be considered light

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
is the pulse of the sun.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
You mean Quark, right?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Sharpie.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Quark has...

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I'm human.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Yeah, so you can't see in the dark.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Everyone else has low light.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I thought you were perfect.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
But I'm human, too.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Yeah, but you got the goggles of night,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
which let you use that dark vision.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Okay, continue, sorry, I misunderstood.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
So yeah, other than the dark sun pulsing,

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
there is no real light,

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
but even that was like a dark anti-light.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Like a shadow light.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Like instead of spreading light,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
it spreads darkness.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Yeah, that's also a thing in Dungeons & Dragons.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
No, I know, I like it.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Yeah, I'm just saying.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And Jeanine Garofalo must be really popular here.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
You feel a tug on your chains.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Yeah, and you see the chains have detached from the wall,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
and now the nine guards are leading you

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
towards the central ring.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Oh, maybe they're going to free us.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Yeah, probably.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
The show's over?

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Yeah.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
It seems like, yeah.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I've never seen a movie or...

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
They wanted to show us perfecting

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000
for the guy in front of us in the show.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Yeah, yeah, we didn't like the guy either.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Thanks, guys.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
All right.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Where'd me park?

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Standing in the center of the ring.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
You didn't really see how they got there,

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000
but you see four figures,

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
one of which is markedly shorter than the rest.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Okay.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
You guys validate?

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
I'm still going with the part.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I'm still going with that.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
They pull you into the middle of the ring,

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
and you're facing these four fellows

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
that look rather familiar.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Oh, it's us!

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
They're us.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
There are shadow versions of ourselves.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Fuck!

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Are they our shadows?

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
They are.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
There are shadows.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
God damn it.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Think of all the tropes.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Do they have goatees?

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.000
And does my guy have multiple number one hits?

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
They're more like sprite recolors.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
It's just a lenient blue.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
It's a cotton green.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
They like it over there.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
I think it's purple is the opposite color, right?

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
All right.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
No, not purple.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Nevermind.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Green.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Okay, so where are we now?

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
You're in the center of the ring,

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
facing down your shadow duplicates.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Oh, God.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
You see the guards who dragged you here

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
are kind of dispersed,

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
and you're no longer around,

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
but you still have bindings around you.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Oh, it makes sense,

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
because Brefi was a spider guy,

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
so now he fought his own version,

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
which was a spider guy.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
And he got his ass beat for his troubles.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Murdered.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Luckily, we're not as strong as joint spiders,

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:26.000
so these guys aren't going to be that strong.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Do they also have a lot of infighting going on

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
and raping each other when we're asleep?

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Yeah, why don't we just hang back

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:47.000
and watch them do bits until they die?

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
One of them is a half Muslim Jewish person.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Why is your shadow taking all of his inventory,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.000
tying it into a ball and throwing it around?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
You just keep fucking a football.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Yeah, you're fucking everything, yeah.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000
You feel the chains around you kind of drop off,

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
and they dissolve into mist,

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
and as this happens,

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
you feel refreshed as if vitality

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
is coursing through you anew.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
All right, I'm only going to say this once.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Non-conflict resolution.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Worth a shot.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Worth a shot.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Worth a shot?

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Although we are in an arena with spectators,

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
this is probably the situation

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000
where that's least going to work.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
You don't have baseball games where they're like,

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
you know what, let's just hang out tonight.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
But it's ourselves.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
All right, let's try.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
It's us.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Well, do they move like us?

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
They haven't moved since you've seen them.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Well, I will pull out an arrow and see

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
if my shadow moves in the same way.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
It doesn't move.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
How do I look?

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
You look great.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Not bad.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Can I shoot my shadow in the foot?

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Do you want to do non-conflict resolution?

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
I want to communicate.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
I'm going to step forward holding my hands

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000
in a nonviolent manner.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.000
And I say, guys, you are us.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000
We are you.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:21.000
That means you don't want to do this either.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Let's not do it together.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And we'll have twice as much a chance as that working.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Of that working.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.000
You're probably drunk too.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.000
A couple articles and prepositions aren't going to bug you.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I wait for your answer.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Take all the time you want.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I step back.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
In unison, the four draw their weapons.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
You're a fucking dick, Spencer.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And you were born a dick and you're going to die a dick.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
You're vindictive and you're petty.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
And this is why people don't like Dungeons and Dragons.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:14.000
They think of nerds as being like these people with all this anger dwelling inside them

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000
that they take it out in these dice and things.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Maybe we should just go out in a football field and just fuck each other up.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Sharpie?

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.000
If you like pain, if you like discomfort, let's go play football.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000
You know, this is supposed to be about fun.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I don't want to die.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
It's Mother's Day.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
She loves season four.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000
If I die, she won't even care.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
She won't notice.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
She was quoting lines.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I wasn't even there.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
She won't notice.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
She only knows I exist because of the fucking television.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
And she's going like, oh, that was a good one.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:06.000
This is like, you know how they do puppet therapy?

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Episode title.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Hey, you're a druid or whatever.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.000
What is your druid's dad think of it?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:28.000
What part of your body did the magic missile get cast out?

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
All right, so they've drawn weapons, I guess.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I guess this looks like we're going to have to slug it out, right?

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Did you say earlier we felt suddenly rejuvenated like we were just reset?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Oh, yeah.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
You got your spells back.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Yeah, I was going to finish saying that.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
But yeah, all of your spells come back and you guys return to full health.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Awesome.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000
So it's going to be seemingly a fair fight.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Seemingly.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I should remind you, you guys are still weakened from losing your shadows,

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
which has given you, you know, ability damage.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Oh, these are our shadows that left.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Yeah.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Yeah, you weren't there and that happened.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I just put it together.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Yeah, these are our shadows.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Shit.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:12.000
So if they win, they get to go hang out with the rest of society

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.000
and the stands and watch people get ripped to shreds.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000
And if we win, we get to have them hang out underneath us when we eat ice cream.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Isn't that a little one-sided?

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Yeah, it seems like they have a lot going on.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
It's like we've entered a world where people, instead of shadows,

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
they're completely disregarded and mistreated.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Yeah.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Huh.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000
In a world invisible the most.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
That's just deep.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
We could cut it here if you want.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
No, no, no.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Five to ten and we...

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
That's what I was saying, like we could launch into combat fresh next time.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Yeah, it's gonna take a while.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
We didn't really put Denise Tenic in any use.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Denise, do you want to fire the first shot?

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Oh, hell yes.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Let's let Denise get at least one shot.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Well, if I shoot at the shadows, is anybody here gonna take damage from...

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Are they in some way linked to the shadows?

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Because, yes, I would shoot two into his.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000
She points at Quark.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
There's no way of knowing for sure.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Okay, I'll shoot two arrows into his shadow.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000
What the fuck? What's going on?

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Your shadow, not you.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I'll remind you that you could shoot three arrows as a result of your speedy longbow.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Thank you.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Yeah, so three.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I also think it's Mother's Day, so...

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
What?

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Anyway, I'm confused sometimes.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Anyway, two of your arrows managed to plant themselves into just the chastle region,

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
but he doesn't seem to bother.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.000
One of them hits him in his exposed shoulder, dealing some damage.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Sorry, everybody.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Nine damage.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Woo!

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
But not to me.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
No, to his shadow.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Yeah, so in your face.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
She didn't want to hurt you.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
She does. She was trying to hurt me.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Adam Goldberg told her to kill my character.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
What if she was prioritizing the most affected combat?

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
That's what the Iranians do, we infiltrate.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Adam Goldberg.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
That's right. She was prioritizing the most affected combatants.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
You're the best fighter we have, so she was getting your equipment.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000
She was saying Adam Goldberg asked her to kill my character, and she was trying to do it.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000
You go, girl.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
I like my interpretation better.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Yeah.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Yeah.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I like it better, too.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
At the same time, Shadow Mulraine fires off three arrows, two of which also miss,

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
and one of which plants itself into Christopher.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
What?

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Happy Mother's Day, dealing four damage.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Alright, I'm okay with that.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Alright.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000
What are we going to stop now?

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
That's up to you guys.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Yeah, let's stop.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
The first shots have been blown.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Yeah, if it bleeds, we can kill it.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I figured out a new way to end the show.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Yeah?

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000
We review and make sure there's nothing to edit out for real, so that we can upload it quicker.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Sounds exhilarating.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
What did we say that we wanted to edit out?

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
The community stuff.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
What was it?

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000
We wanted to edit out that guy actually yelling the N-word.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Wait, someone actually just yelled out the N-word?

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Yeah.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Who was it?

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Who was it?

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I'm black.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
It's okay.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Oh, he's black.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Wait, get up here.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Get up here, for fuck's sake.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Alright.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
God, just say it for us, would you?

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Oh, God, we got a Farsi woman to come up and say the C-word.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Alright.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
What's your name, first of all?

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Nigger.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Alright.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Yay!

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
It's fun.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000
They took it back.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Thanks for coming to Harmon Channel, everybody.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
We did it.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Let's hear it one more time for Denise.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Thank you so much, Denise, for coming up here.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Spencer.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Kumail Nanjiani.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Okay.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:47:06.000
And everybody else, here we go.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Jason.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
We're going to edit out his name.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Well, it was already a fake name, right?

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000
One more time for Jason.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Jason, I'm a digger.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000
A Burbank, California.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Happy Mother's Day, Jason's mom.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000
I'm Jeff Davis, your count.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Tell her one more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Good night.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Good night.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Good night.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Good night.
