00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
From Hollywood, California, nearing the end of our meltdown comics run, it's sad again.

00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
It might be the beginning of a whole new thing, nonetheless, Harmontown is now in session.

00:22.000 --> 00:42.000
The following is with Spencer Crittenden and Rob Schrab.

00:42.000 --> 01:01.000
Are you all right? I just murdered a guy's toes.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
I think it's our protest mentor, isn't it? We're talking about protesting, and then I never protested anything.

01:07.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm spitting all over you. It's vodka. Bad start. Bad start. Take charge, Harmon. Fuck you people.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Don't show weakness. What is this? I want to see in the back.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Wait, are these new glasses you're wearing?

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
They're one of two pairs of glasses I got. The kids...

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Those look like new glasses, Dan.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
A lot of you guys, some of you don't need glasses. A lot of you do. You're 25, I always assume.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I imagine a massive, like...

01:39.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm 46.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Spencer can't make it. Okay.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Can I just have an empty chair?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
I don't know, it feels wrong.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Who's in my living room right now?

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Oh. Okay, fine.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Now you know the backstory.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
She's outside the window.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
A lot of you are just straight up myopic or something like you. You have bad eyes. You were born with them.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
We've been tampering with evolution for a while.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
What does your eyesight do to get you non-reproductively viable in the First World Empire,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
which has been raging for long enough to spread a lot of bad eyesight?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
How did you know when Caveman's eyes went bad?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Caveman didn't live till past 20 anyway.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
What I'm saying is, my audience, you're probably born with bad eyes. You're Harmon fans.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
I, 2020, solid gold carrot, night vision fucking, like, see-through walls all the time.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
I have what's called a stigmatism.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
My eyeballs aren't perfectly round. Whoop-de-doo.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
So the next time you're telling me white privilege, fuck you.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
There's some shit you gotta deal with.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
My eyeballs are not perfectly round.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Apparently that means as I get older, now I'm 44, so as I get older now,

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
my vision is getting worse from both ends.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
So I'm not blowing anyone's mind with this. It's just frustrating.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It's like a Louis C.K. bit or something.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
You just have this conversation with an optometrist.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
So what are you saying?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
They go, like, look at this. Now look at that with the lenses.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
And they go, okay, so here's the thing.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
The reason your phone's blurry is because you can't see some stuff up close.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
The reason the sign's blurry far away is because some stuff really far away.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
So you want two pairs of glasses?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
What? Excuse me, what?

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Bad eyesight. Jesus Christ.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Sounds like you're talking about some bad eyesight.

03:55.000 --> 04:04.000
What's amazing, you guys, no spoilers, but this is all elaborate me undies ad.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
So I'm wearing, I decided, I don't know why.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
I got two pairs of glasses. One's for reading, so I can look at my phone.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
These are for, literally, the purpose of these is so that I can read to Cody

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
when she's taken her contacts out the forensic files,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
summaries on the TV.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
That's the only use that these have, but I've been wearing them around

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
because I'm told by some people, like, well, you're supposed to wear them

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
so that your eyes adjust. I don't, I hate it.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
They're like $300 frames. They're Johnny Varvatos.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
I thought they were Johnny Varvatos.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
The very one.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Is he out? Did he fucking make bail?

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
Hey, Johnny. Hey, Johnny, man. Hey, Johnny.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
I think he's the last Ramon, right?

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Hey, Johnny. Johnny, my man, Johnny.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Want an apple? Hey, Johnny. Come over and get some apples, Johnny.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
Johnny, free apples for Johnny Varvatos. Everybody.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Where's my special glasses? Why are you drinking from the red solo cup?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I put them on my shirt because I don't eat them.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
No, no, you're red, you're solo cup. You're Jane Cook glasses.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Oh, those glasses. Oh, yeah.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah, well, where were those?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I don't know.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Oh, maybe they were stolen. Started Kickstarter.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I don't know. I don't know where they are.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
We'll find out.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
They're being scuttled out.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
A lot of fuckups. That's why we're leaving.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Well, we're gonna, for the next couple of weeks we are gonna,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
it's not tonight. There's nothing special tonight.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
But I'm sorry, I keep spitting. I'm sorry, the gobs have spit.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
They don't sit there because they don't want to get spit on.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, but it's not, but it's, they don't know.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Okay, here's, I don't want to derail the show,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
but if anybody has like a small pair of scissors,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
we've done this before. We did it in San Francisco.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Honestly.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
We just want to do a small tracheotomy.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Just the walrus hairs coming out of it.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Can Paul the whip guy in the front row,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
can you whip his mustache hairs off?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
No, don't do that.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Uh, anybody, does anybody have mustache scissors on them?

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I got my ears and nose waxed today.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Because it's gonna keep happening otherwise.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Because I drink and then it, and then it, these are, that won't work.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Any takers?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Alright. Or a straw.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Or a match. A straw.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
A match.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
A knife.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Um, alright, well let's keep the show rolling.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Let's keep it rolling.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Alright, so I want to, what, what was the,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
what happened with United Airlines today?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Something happened where there was like a family

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
that was barred from getting on.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
All I know is I saw Twitter line up and the,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
the end result of what I saw was it seemed like America,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
American parents were divided down the middle

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
on how old their daughters should be

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
before they could be regarded as too hot to get on a plane.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
What?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
No, it was, I saw a headline that said

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
two, two women were not allowed on because of leggings.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
But it was like employee, they were past passengers

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
which meant that they were employees of United,

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
like they were flying for free

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
because they were friends of the company or something.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So it was a more archaic dress code

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
that they employ for, they have a higher standard

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
for friends of the airline that get on the plane.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
But it's like, it just called everybody's attention

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
to like this weird archaic thing.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Like in this random incident really,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
you're talking about probably a short fuse blown

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
by somebody who's just like, like,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
hey, what, close your legs, Missy.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I mean, if we, if we, if we haven't seen

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
disgusting shit on an airplane by now,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
what country are we living in?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Like, I, I...

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
Gerard, Gerard de Bardoux peed in first class.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I would, I would like...

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
He's not in Guantanamo right now.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
I would like to open the books about what's allowed

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
on an airplane as far as like fashion is concerned

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
and things like that.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I'd like to, I'd like to...

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
You know, but I don't want to, like,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
maybe your feet are really tired.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
I don't want to tell one gross person,

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
don't take off your shoes.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Like, like, like, because, like,

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
even though I don't want to look at your feet

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
at the same time, I don't know,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
airplanes are a hard place to be.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Some lady put her feet on your head.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
One thing's for sure,

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
we don't all look like a Mormon choir

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
when we get on the plane.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Like, we're fucking, like, everybody puts on their sweat pants

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
and yoga pants and hats and leg braces and...

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I transform into a pickup.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Uh...

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Are you iron-eyed?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I'm part of a larger set of toys

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
that you can only get at Christmas.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
It's like 35 bucks for it.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
There's me and there's a helicopter

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
and we all attach to the airplane.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
It's not cool like Voltron.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
It doesn't turn into a robot,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
but it turns into a big, giant, clunky airplane

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
that has a pickup truck on the top.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
My parents are divorced.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
It's a bad Christmas.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
This is just 80s humor.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Just, uh...

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
All right, let's bring up Brandon Johnson.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yay!

09:00.000 --> 09:12.000
If you need a suit, come to Johnny Vaughn bottles.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
Get your suit down here at Johnny Vaughn bottles.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Johnny Vaughn bottles!

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Free apples.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
But there are a lot of people...

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
In my Twitter feed, there are people arguing.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
They're going like,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
but she was 10 years old.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
That's not a teenager,

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
but it was like the original thing.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
And then there were people posting...

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I saw a guy post a picture of his 10-year-old daughter

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
going,

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
here's my 10-year-old daughter in leggings.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Is that obscene?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
And I was like,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
all right, slow down.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
A creepy Uncle Mark.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
That's not your daughter.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
It's just like...

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
It's just like the sound of permission

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
rang out to a certain demo.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
And they said,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
oh, what if they're 10 years old

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
and they're too sexy for leggings?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
You know in America,

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
we're sort of like,

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
would I fuck it?

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Would I don't care?

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
But it's kind of like...

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Obviously you would not fuck that joke.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
That joke is ugly.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
But there is a really weird thing.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
If you put that joke in some leggings, though.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
One of my favorite non-pornographic little areas

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
I visit on YouTube,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
legs lavish,

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
which is,

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
hosiery reviews,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
foreign by women.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm sure it is.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
I don't think a lot of their audience is women.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
But it's like,

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
it's not...

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I mean,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
you have to have an extreme leg,

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
foot,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
and specifically in hosiery fetish,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
like they're not...

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
The rules of pornography are really weird.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Famously, they're totally subjective.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
And YouTube pulled...

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
They pulled somebody...

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Also, it's just about who complains about what.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Like, all of a sudden one day,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
legs lavish was like shut down

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
because somebody was like,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I just think that's a really funny thing

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
to be simultaneously on the side of purity

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
and basically confessing

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
that you recognize something as sexual.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
It's its own kink.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Whoever smelt a delta should definitely apply

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
to pornography.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Because the Supreme Court judge that famously said,

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
he said,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I don't know pornography.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I don't know what...

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I know it when I see it.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
And that's a fair enough...

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
That's probably the most judicial thing you can say

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
when you're policing something like pornography

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
and basically...

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
That was the famous case of Smelted vs. Delta.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Well, isn't that where the Dalmatian video

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
from the community...

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
The guy...

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
He got shut down because of the same thing.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
And it wasn't because of us, I don't think.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
No.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
It wasn't because we drew attention to it.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
It was shut down before that.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Legs lavish?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
It's hosiery reviews for women by women.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Are the legs...

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
The legs are lavished in hosiery.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Which they can be.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
They're British.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Are the legs lavishing things?

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
No, their legs are being lavished with high quality hosiery.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
They should be called lavished legs.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
And they're telling you whether or not you should buy them.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Harmonies are right for a pipsite.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
These legs are lavished.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
With hosiery.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Occultremont, if you will.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Thank you.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I subscribed to Brandon's porn site

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
called Upscale Nation of Islam.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
For the ladies.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Why just have one small clip on bowtie?

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Why don't have better bowties?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
We call it bean pies made by these thighs.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
All your Muslim needs...

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
Stopped a man, but you don't want to get arrested?

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
This tasteful librarian from the 30s will teach you how.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
I ain't down for this shit, but I also might work at Brooks Brothers.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
We can't always be like, you know, British rock cool.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Some of us...

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
That's a compliment, goddammit!

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Man, y'all look tricky tonight.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
I knew this bowtie was a failure!

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
But it's one of those rare nights where you and I are both dressed up.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Sometimes it's usually one or the other.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
Yeah, I usually wear an orange suit, jump suit, big...

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Big footies.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
I see you picking up trash in that 101.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
But you are always stellarly dressed.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Round of applause for Jeff Davis.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
That's what you do right before you put somebody down.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Because queers need love.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
That was like a classic roast setup.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Back when it was funny to be queer.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
You can order the roast videos.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
Another thing that's been phased out that you kids should be grateful for.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Sometimes at the drawing room you take a little trip back in time socially.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
I was told I was a lucky guy today because I was with my girlfriend.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
You know, millennials may not hear you're a lucky guy as much because it seems...

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
It means I want to fuck your girlfriend in front of you.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
And you're too ugly to fuck her.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
Congratulations on the acquisition of something out of your league.

14:20.000 --> 14:28.000
It kind of just offends everybody except possibly hypothetically a woman with incredibly low self-esteem

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
who might be standing there being told that the man she's currently fucking is luckier

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
than the man who's saying to the other man in front of her, I'd like to fuck her.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
What was your response?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Thank you.

14:42.000 --> 14:57.000
She has her moments.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
Every day of my life is the first eight minutes of a horror movie set in the Appalachians.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
I just don't want anyone to eat me or beat me up.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
I just want directions to the next gas station so I can keep that movie from crossing the threshold.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
You're a lucky guy.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Thank you.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Thank you, sir.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Another drink, please.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Just keep making TV.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
They won't eat you.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I am a lucky guy.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I am a fucking lucky guy.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
Like, you'd have to be less lucky than me to be offended quickly enough to be a gentleman

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
and go, excuse me, sir.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I mean, who's going to take somebody to school?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I mean, he was 70.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
You're doing the cold open to get out right now, by the way.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Well, I don't know.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I'm the only person that hasn't seen Get Out yet.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
I want to start like a little group.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
Well, they hate you for not having seen it.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
They're actually mad that you haven't seen it.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
But my screener from Moonlight came and I watched it right away.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
You will watch a man jerk off another man.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
But you will not watch a man escape to freedom.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
He's got you.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
He's got you there.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Because there's no screener.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
He's got you there.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
He's right.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Enjoy your privilege.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Yep.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Enjoy your privilege.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
I will say Moonlight, definitely.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Wait, what one best director?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
La La Land.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
See, that's a big step.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Moonlight, I didn't see La La Land.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I'm white enough.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
I've seen the art for it and I just know that's going to make me golf.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
I don't need that in my life.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
I'm still trying to get Moulin Rouge out of my ear.

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
But I thought that Moonlight was brilliantly directed.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I don't know from La La Land.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I don't know.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
I guess it's hard to direct people going La La's and stuff.

17:08.000 --> 17:16.000
It is definitely like this was directed well, kind of screams off of Moonlight.

17:16.000 --> 17:24.000
I have a pet peeve about slice of life movies because I work so hard all day trying to figure out what should happen next.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
And then when shit just kind of lays out and you leave the movie on, that was well directed.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
There's a part of me, the writer part of me is like, you better not give the best picture.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Yeah.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
Because it takes more, you're going to do that plus.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
But it was like, so the patience and the, you know, where the camera was and also like the more, yeah, whatever.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I'm not going to tell you why Moonlight was good.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
What the fuck am I doing?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I was impressed though.

17:48.000 --> 17:57.000
It passed like this incredible litmus test because I like hit the wrong button and I think my dog sitter might have put Moonlight in the Blu-ray player.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Something some happened.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
That's why I was like half drunk and like I hit a button and Moonlight started playing.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I had no idea what the fuck it was.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
I like had one sock on and was like.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
You accidentally watched Moonlight.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Yeah, like seven minutes.

18:14.000 --> 18:25.000
He accidentally watched Moonlight because his dog sitter might have put it in there.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
What's it going to take to get him to see get out?

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
I don't get that reference, but I'm sure something terrible happened.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
I got to drink a bowl of cum.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
The way horror movies have been going, there's like one moment in every horror movie.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
There's always a thing.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
There's always a bowl of cum.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Don't breathe.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Don't breathe.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
It has a bowl of cum in it.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Spoilers.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Wait.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Wait, they can't breathe because they have a mouthful of cum.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
It's not why they can't breathe.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
I can't breathe.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
They can't breathe because.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
I can't breathe.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
I can't breathe.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Sir.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Sir.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
You can't breathe.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I can't breathe.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I also didn't ask you to drink that bowl of cum.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
I've almost finished.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
That was for my guests.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
We're supposed to be here robbing a blind man.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
Why did you bring a bowl of cum?

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
You can breathe.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
Well, now I feel stupid.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Let's go rob that blind guy's house.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Don't you think, I've heard blind people can hear better.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Well, you know what makes you real quiet?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
No.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Let's open that cooler in the back seat.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
What are these three bowls of what looks like coconut milk

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
and what smells like paper mache?

19:48.000 --> 19:56.000
Yeah, that's what it is.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
Tastes like pineapple.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
I feel so racist because I'm picturing little Asian bowls

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
on like beautiful ice like a seafood buffet.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Are you saying that's racist because you're imagining

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
white people cum in smaller portions?

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
Let's settle this right now.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
I'm racist.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
I'm picturing these little bowls.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
It was the bowls.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
That doesn't make you racist.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
That doesn't make you racist.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
That makes you art department.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
And that makes you homophobic.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
When I was a kid, I had a friend named Kent who,

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
he was a white dude and he was a freaky ass white dude

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
and we were all jumping up on the mattresses

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
and he was like, let's get naked.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
So we get naked.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
We get naked and he's like spread your ass cheeks.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I've never seen inside of black dudes.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
But at which point, don't act like this hasn't happened

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
all of us.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
So at which point...

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
Dan hasn't seen get out yet, so...

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
Spoiler alert.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
I feel like I'm not even going to finish my story now.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm just going to leave you motherfuckers right there.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
No, no, no, no, no, no. Finish the story.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I'm going to walk you back.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
How old are you at this point?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I was 18.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
No, I was...

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I had to be, I was about five.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I was about five years old.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
So I do my duty.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
You know, I'm doing the right thing.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
You know, I spread my butt cheeks.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yes.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
So I go, motherfucker, your turn.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Your turn.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
So he spread his butt cheeks and he had toilet tissue stuck.

21:42.000 --> 21:49.000
And I thought, don't, don't, don't be grossed out yet.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Hold your roll.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
So I thought, oh my God, if brown people poop brown,

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
white people must poop white.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
Just like the plot of Get Out.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
So you said he had white poop stuck in his white butt.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
What else was I supposed to think?

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
I mean, the story, just like you say,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
white poop stuck in his white butt.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Like, it's like something, it's like something

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
Fred Sanford would say to somebody to kick him out.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
He'd get the fuck out of here.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Take your white poop and your white butt,

22:25.000 --> 22:33.000
and get the fuck out.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
I mean, your story asks a lot more questions than an answer.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Well, I'd like to know more about this friendship.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Not that we all didn't have, like we were,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
that's what childhood happens.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
And, you know, like...

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
And then what happened?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
What happened exactly?

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
That's why we watched Transformers.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Right, right.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
We continued to jump on mattresses.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Oh, yeah.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
But naked or did you get re-robed and...

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
I mean, at that point I was freaked out.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
We got re-robed.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
No, we stagnated.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
So, he was like six years old,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
but he was playing the race card.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Like, he said, he like made it racial

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
because he wanted to see your butthole.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
It's true.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
It's very early, it starts.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
That's pretty villainous.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I guess pretty villainous.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
But don't, Dan, don't just...

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
He's not saying that I think my butthole's better

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
than your butthole.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
He's saying I...

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
I guess he's a kid and he's using whatever he can use.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Don't you think he would say,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I've never seen a short person's butthole?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Exactly.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I've never seen a blonde person's butthole.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Consciousness of race may be present

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
in very early youth, but it's not always sinister.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
I was picturing it as like, he was abusing a power dynamic.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Like, he was like,

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
I've never seen a black person's butthole,

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
so now show it to me.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
No.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Complete me.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
No.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I showed it to him and he said,

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
you're really a lucky guy.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
You're a lucky fucking guy.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
Also, what Brandon hasn't told you,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
is the story takes place on the catamaran in Cancun.

24:00.000 --> 24:08.000
I'm trying to remember...

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
It's a great way to lick a somebody's butthole.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Like, you can just pretend that...

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
We showed each other our dicks, like, a lot.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Like, I said that,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
me and Brian across the street when we were like that age,

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
we had...

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I don't remember what penis parties were,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
but I remember telling my parents about penis parties.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I think it was just me and Brian from across the street.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
We would run into the bushes,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
I think we'd just pull out our junk and like,

24:32.000 --> 24:38.000
our junk, what am I, a skateboarder?

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
What am I, a Comedy Central show?

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Our cocks, our hard six-year-old cocks.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
Tungsten, fucking...

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
But the thing that sticks out of my memory

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
is just telling us we would run giggling,

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
because we thought the word penis was funny

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
and the alliteration and stuff,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
and then we were like, we just had a penis party

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
and our parents being like,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
it's the 70s, okay.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Your parents were like, sort of the way, but different.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Yeah, yeah, get out of here.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
We were having a fondue pineapple fucking...

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
in the match game, and it's fucking.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
No, it wasn't.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
My parents were the same as they are now.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
They just wore like shower curtains.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Ah, the 70s.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
Hey, do you guys think United should let little girls

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
with leggings...

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
I don't know, okay, alright.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Oh, today is the 75th anniversary

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
of the flash dance reference

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
that you see in every fucking animated movie

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
that nobody knows what it is.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Ask them if they know what it is.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
They don't.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Listen to their silence.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Every time there's a fucking animated movie

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
that involves dancing,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
an animated character will go over to a chair

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
and it will cut to a side view of them

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
and they'll pull a chain and water will come down.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
That is a reference to a 1930s Lumiere Brothers movie

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
called Flash Dance that none of us, me included,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
have ever seen, and they just keep referencing it.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
And because the director of those movies

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
that you're watching are my age,

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
and they grew up on references to that movie.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
References to it.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
It's Flash Dance.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
75th anniversary of that reference makes no fucking sense.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
Wait, what did you recently see that referenced in?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
That sing movie.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
You know, there was an ad,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
there was like a billboard with a pig,

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
there's water coming down on the pig.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
Nick Roll's character.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
And then I was sitting in the rustic inn today

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
and Shrek 9 was playing over someone's shoulder.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
And I saw like a chipmunk was like,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I love these cookies and he helps her dance about them

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
and then water came down.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
I don't know what Shrek it was.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
They probably do it in every Shrek.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
75th anniversary of that bit.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
Do you think like the last Shrek

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
was doing references to the first Shrek?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Could be.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Don't know.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Can't tell my Shrek's part.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Why was that bad?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I got groaned.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Oh God.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
What happened?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
What happened?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I've never seen a Shrek.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
I've never seen the Shrek's.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Not the first one.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I've seen.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
It's no get out.

27:20.000 --> 27:30.000
I watched Dead Ringers today with Jeremy Irons.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
He came over?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
No.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
Me and Jeremy Irons.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Why didn't you invite me over too?

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
You just have movie dates with Jeremy Irons?

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Come on, let's watch it.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
When was the last time you said it?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Well, it's the premiere.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
There's another thing in this Shrek thing

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
that I saw in the bar over someone's shoulder.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
They were doing a walk and talk

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
and it was like a mall

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
and they were walking past malls, medieval malls.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
So the joke area is obviously,

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
okay, they're in a mall,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
but it's like fairy tale times.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
And there wasn't even three of them.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
There was just one that said versarchery.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
You've got to work harder than that.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
You've got seven years to write these jokes.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Wait, was that like Versace?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Versarchery?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Yeah.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I was saying even,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
and then the table was going like,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I mean, come on, throw it to a room.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
You get years.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
It wasn't like it was built into the plot.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
It was like that joke is the last thing you can write.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
And then we were like,

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
okay, well, what do you do?

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Medieval malls.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
And I was like, forever 21.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
And then Cody said, forever 12.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Which was really funny.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Way too funny for a Shrek movie.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Forever 12 like fucking cracked me up.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
You go to a mall in medieval times and it's forever 12.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
It's really, really dark and funny.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
It's funny in layers.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
It hits you in waves how funny that is.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
Forever 12.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
It's so dark.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
And then you're like, it's dark about consumerism.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
It's dark about our youth worship.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
It's dark about life expectancy.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
It's dark about...

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
It's also a story that's sponsored by United Airlines.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Yeah.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
I thought it was like only the 12th version of forever.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
But now we're already up to forever 21.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
And in 10 years, there'll be forever 31.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
So that joke was funny on multiple levels.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
Even the people who have maybe a little learning disability.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Kill City.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to think of more medieval mall stores.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Armorani.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
What?

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Armorani.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Armorani?

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Armorani.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I mean, that's as good as Versus Archery.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
My thing was I would just, you know, my bag of tricks.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I'm Dan Harmon.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
I would have just kept Versa Archery, done Armoranery.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
And then the third one would have been like a word play clearing house.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Half off.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
Going out of business.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
And it was like, work less hard, be more meta.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Everyone will say you're smart.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
You're actually just less funny.

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
Also, you could throw in a Johnny Varvatos.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
There could be Ye Old Republic instead of Banana Republic.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
Instead of the Gap, maybe the Gout.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
The Gout.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
The Baby Gout.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
The Baby Gout.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
What about Gout for Kids?

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
Incredibly heavy Brookstone.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Because I don't know, maybe rocks were bigger back then?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Because it's in the, it's in the Brook.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
So it's, but Brook Boulder, Brook Boulder.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
And then you go home and you research erosion.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
And you're like, oh, it became a stone by modern times.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Brook Boulder.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
What about hot dog on a tree?

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
Because they didn't know stick technology, by the way.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Yeah.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Before access.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Yeah.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
The second, the second store is, is like a Home Depot, but it's under construction.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
Because they're like, we don't even have the shit to build the Home Depot.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
Much, much less get this hot dog off a tree.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
We save this fucking movie.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
This movie is no Simpsons signs.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Those are the best signs in the business.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Which signs?

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Simpsons.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Oh, Simpsons signs.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Yeah.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Well, that's got to be your low bar.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
You got to like, like, like, I mean, that's unfortunate for all of us.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
That the Simpsons like, like top the game.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
It's like, if you're going to have people walk past signs, you better, you better bring your,

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
try to bring your Simpsons.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
It's hard.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
It's not easy, folks.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Jokes is hard.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
Yeah.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
The shittiest complaint ever.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Jokes is hard.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Man, he jokes is hard, man.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm out there giving that crowd everything I got.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Ooh.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Ooh.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Somebody's shit is sad.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
Did you ever get the, I was so bad at stand up in Milwaukee.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
Like, I often, the guy that, the, when the host would come up after me, I'd often hear,

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
come on, folks, keep it going, comedy isn't easy.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
Like, that, and I'd be like halfway to my seat.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Like, because sometimes I think I killed.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
I was like, like, I don't know the difference yet.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
I'm, I'm this bad because I haven't done it more than three times.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
So that was the best time.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Comedy isn't easy.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
Well, maybe he just wanted them to know that.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Oh.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Oh.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Mm-hmm.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
I hope that motherfucker's watching community right now.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
It's canceled.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
It's canceled.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
It shows no.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Good night.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
He can't even, he can't even watch it.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Or no, Hulu bought the.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
There we go.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Hulu.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Oh yeah.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Watch Hulu.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
Hulu's slogan is, you're a lucky guy.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Just looking at my list.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
Hulu bought the last season?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Yeah, they did.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
They bought, so they have them all now.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Hulu, you can watch all the communities.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
There you go.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Yeah.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Yeah.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
You guys, so, all right.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
So I had a breakthrough in therapy.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
But, or no, I didn't yet.

33:26.000 --> 33:32.000
But I had a, I got, I got instructions that I think that I.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
I mean, like I, what I mean is I was told something in therapy

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
that I think, that I recognize as being the most important thing

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
to improve my life.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
What?

33:43.000 --> 33:50.000
That's the funniest thing you've ever seen.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Oh guys, he looked at his phone for a minute.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Oh, I had a breakthrough in therapy.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Oh wait, no.

33:56.000 --> 34:04.000
No, I'm sorry, I didn't yet.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Comedy isn't easy.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
But I, what I mean is I got the tools now

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
to learn how to use them.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Like I walked out and I was like, yeah, I got it, I got it.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
It's the word mirror.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
It's the, it's the thing that I haven't been doing.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
I always thought when you talk to people, like the reason it's exhausting

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
is because you're putting energy into them.

34:23.000 --> 34:28.000
So somebody goes like, oh, my hair is important.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
And then you, you're like, you just, you think in your head,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
you go like, you're a fucking vampire.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
And you're, and it's like, how do I look at you

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
without feeling your soul screaming?

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
And, but, but you, like, like, that's not your job.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
You don't have to put, you don't have to give up your own energy.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
You've become a mirror.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
That's what you're supposed to do.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
You're supposed to, but I haven't done it yet.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I walked out and I'm like, I'm going to go try that.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
And then I was like, hey, like, like someone was like,

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
can I borrow a dollar?

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
And I was like, you'd like a dollar.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And then I stopped trying it because the guy was like,

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
That's what you're supposed to do.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Just repeat what they say.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Well, you're supposed to, you're supposed to reflect who they are.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Okay, let's try it.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
But you, but you have to put your shirt on like,

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
like other way.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Should we try it?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
No, the people, people are interested in themselves.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Everyone's been, you know, they come to you.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Not me.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
You're very contrarian.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
That's great about you.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
You're interesting.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
You're interesting.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
I love, I love, it's amazing how you interrupt.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I love your phone and your glasses.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Tell them you're lucky.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Tell them you're lucky.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
You're, I saw Kate getting the mail the other day.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
You're a lucky guy.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Yeah.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
What?

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
You've got a lot of mail.

35:48.000 --> 35:58.000
Hey, Dan, my hair is very important to me.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
Sounds like it.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Tell me more.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
About your hair.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
There's got to be, there's got to be more to it than that.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Just repeating.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
She wasn't like telling me, don't, don't throw, I was just saying, like, I just,

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
it was right at the end of the session.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
She's like, you know, do that thing where you're a mirror.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And I was like, wait, a mirror?

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
You mean like four agreements, how we're all mirrors and smoke and light?

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
She's like, what the fuck?

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
No.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Can't authorize you reading that poison.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
I'm a fucking therapist.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
No, she likes it.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
I told her I read it.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
She's like, that's fine.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
As long as the fifth agreement is you keep coming to me.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
I was like, no, the fifth agreement is that he had his son write a book.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Okay.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
She's like, I heard you talk about that episode 300.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Okay.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
I was like, you listen to the show?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
She's like, yeah, I'm like, all right, well, let's, I'll keep coming to you.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
She's like, you're not going to get better.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I'm like, okay.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
She's never listened to the show.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Where was I?

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Mirror.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Oh, she just said, be a mirror.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
And she's like, yeah, you know, people want to, when they, when they come, when someone

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
puts out an emotional bid, for instance, if you're in a couple, like, like, is somebody

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
saying, look at that thing over there, or I did this thing today or whatever.

37:13.000 --> 37:19.000
They're not saying necessarily, they don't have the time to say, or they're like, I,

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
I have something to say.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
And I've thought it through, and it's the most important thing in the world.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
And it's so worthy of your attention, and it says so much about me.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
And also, you know, it's just, it's a lot of times it's just, we're just like little,

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
you know, animals, we're just like touching each other verbally, of course, we just,

37:38.000 --> 37:44.000
it's, so I have this problem, like small talk, like I can't, you know, and it's like a lot

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
of, I'm sure a lot of my audience has small talk problems.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
You know, whether you have ADD or Asperger's, that's really the two groups in my audience.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
But, but both have a problem with small talk, because it's like, kind of like, I don't know,

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
it engages the logical part of your brain, and you're like, well, what do you, what do you mean?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Why don't you tell, like, I don't know what you're telling me, man.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
But, but it doesn't, it's not that simple either.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
It's not like we're Spock, and we want people to just make sense.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
It's like, it's just, also it's like, some people say shit just because they want to,

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
they want to talk.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
I don't fucking know yet.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
But, but like, I always thought it was like, we all have energy.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
Like, I have a bucket of energy when I wake up, you have a bucket of energy.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
Some people have a hole in the bottom of their bucket of energy.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
They're called executives.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
I had to riff a thing, I don't know.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
But, but, but like, some people, you know, you've met those people, they're just like,

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
hey, what about me?

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
And you're like, oh, you, and you pour some in, and because the hole's not that big,

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
it kind of fills up a little bit, and then you're like, wait, it's Wednesday.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Didn't you say, hey, what about me on Tuesday?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
But, and you slowly learn over time that they're a vampire.

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
Like, they're going to suck all of your juice into their bucket, and theirs has no bottom.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
Yours does, but yours doesn't fill that fast, because you have dignity.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
But, but it's not necessarily like that.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
You have, you could just, people can just radiate things.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Like, I radiate shame.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
I have so much shame that if everyone lets me, the fucking buckets would overflow with it.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Like, no one was a deal with my shame.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Like, I love it.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
I'm just, it certainly fills a show out after we run out of shit.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
United leggings forever 12, that's it.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I don't know why I keep looking at this.

39:12.000 --> 39:18.000
But, but like, I think, you know, there are people who are good at that thing that we tease therapists for

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
and they, they listen and then they repeat what you said back to you.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
Like, what I'm hearing is this and that, but like, you can do that emotionally.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
You don't even have to really actually say the words.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
It's just that you could perceive yourself as a mirror, and it's about them.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
It's not about you.

39:38.000 --> 39:44.000
It's like your job in the conversation is for them to have some time to work some shit out.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
And that can actually be good for them.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
And you're a mirror.

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
So you're, you're a passive role, but you're like actively like helping them.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
Yeah, it's called listening or a first date.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
It's called the first date because on your first date, you're like, what?

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Yes, more.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
You're chill.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
What your dad?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
He was a what underwater.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
Oh man.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
But, but as we get familiar with people, we're like, God damn underwater.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I heard the first time Jesus Christ.

40:16.000 --> 40:22.000
But truthfully, you'd always be super satisfied if you stayed interested in the shit that was around you.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Yeah, because nobody, yeah.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
I mean, it's being a mirror is not just like, like listening.

40:27.000 --> 40:33.000
It's like saying like, not like, you can just reflect what they're saying back at them because that's why they're talking.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Right.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Yeah, I think it's, I think it's like, yeah, it's like key.

40:36.000 --> 40:42.000
Like you don't have to just mockingly repeat back or make a photocopy or, but, but like it's just listening.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
I guess I had to think of it as a mirror because otherwise I was thinking of it as like an exchange.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Like, oh, I'm giving you energy.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
When do I get it back?

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
I'm giving you time.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
When do I, oh, that just came from Minecraft.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Now I can play Minecraft less time.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
No, I'm a mirror.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
No, I'm getting fucked out of Minecraft time.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
All right.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
Well, but, but if you're a mirror, okay, it doesn't apply to time.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
You're still fucking me out of time.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
I could be playing Minecraft.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
Do you feel fucked out of Minecraft time right now because we're doing a harming?

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
I mean, there's some things I'd like to try at my base.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
No, I don't know.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
I'm fine here.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
It's fine.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
You know, what do we got another hour to kill?

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Shady ass answer.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
It's fine.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
No, no, it's fine.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
How was your one-man show?

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
The answer was yes.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
It's fine.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
What do you mean?

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
No, no, I'm not going to, I know I'm not going to be all the way happy when I'm playing Minecraft

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
tonight as soon as I get home.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I'm not going to immediately become blissful.

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
I'm like, I'm, if I didn't have this, I'd be unhappy over time.

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
Do you, do you play Minecraft with Jeremy Irons?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
And what is that like?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Yeah.

41:49.000 --> 41:55.000
And, and do your Jeremy Irons impression while you tell us the story?

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
What will you do with that wood?

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
Who are you?

42:03.000 --> 42:08.000
Patrick Stewart.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Can you send Jeremy Irons in?

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
So I basically want a second chance.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Yes.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Thank you, Patrick.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Jeremy.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
Yes.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
I'm Patrick Stewart.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
I know.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
That's pretty good.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Go talk to Dan.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
I will.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Hello, Dan.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
What did you eat?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
A cupcake.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
It's in your throat?

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Yes.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Where's John Lithgow?

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I'm right here.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
My mouth is a circle.

42:48.000 --> 42:55.000
I do a perfect John Lithgow because I know how to make my mouth into a circle.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Hello.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Hello.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Hey Dan, this is Steve Levy.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
This is John Lithgow.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Oh, sorry.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Do you have Dan's phone?

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Can you give the phone to Dan for a second?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Dan, someone's calling you on the phone.

43:07.000 --> 43:14.000
Hey Dan, I've got iced tea on the line for you right now.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
All right.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Hello?

43:17.000 --> 43:25.000
Yeah.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
Who is this?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Who is this?

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
This is iced tea.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
Mr. T, don't ever.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
I mean, okay.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I didn't want to be informal.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
Much more less formal than calling me motherfucking iced Mr. T.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
All right.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
Well, what are you doing?

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
I called you to listen to you play Minecraft, motherfucker.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
All right.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
Describe it to me.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
What's it like?

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Well, I'm digging into the dirt.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
Yeah, it's every piece of dirt, a cube.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
So you do know a little bit about Minecraft.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
It sounds like I didn't say that.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Shit.

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
All I could tell you, if I play Minecraft, it's none of your business.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
It's personal.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Well, I got to keep playing.

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
I have to put one hand on the W, A, S, and D keys.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
And if you're playing on a Mac OS, you got to use the trackpad.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
So you need two hands.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
So put me on with Lithgow.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
It's me, John Lithgow.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
Talking to you iced tea.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Yeah, John, what are we doing later?

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
I would like to go fishing for lamprey

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
so I can experience visualizing a creature

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
with its more circular mouth than me.

44:56.000 --> 45:02.000
Damn, that's fucked up.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
I'm coming to pick you up now.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Okay, cool.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Go away.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Damn.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Hello?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Dan, this is your other cell phone.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
This is iced tea.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Oh, sorry.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Mr. T, Walter?

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Oh, don't fucking do it.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
You think it's respectful, but it's not.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
Mr. T, this is important.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
Walter Mathos on the line.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
He needs to talk to you.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
It's a matter of real importance.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
All right, put him on.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Wait, is it personal?

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
No, actually, this is business.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Oh, cool.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Business I can do.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I got John Lithgow coming to pick me up.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
I can do business.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Yo, Walter.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Math out.

45:50.000 --> 46:02.000
What's going on?

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
What the fuck is going on over there, man?

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
You eating a muppet?

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
Oh, shit, there's an amber alert.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
My fucking phone's it's blowing up.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
There's an amber alert.

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
Man, you Walter Math out, Richard Nixon and his shit.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
Yeah, flush that impression.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Amber alert.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
Be on the lookout for a Ford, Taurus,

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
97, six cylinder,

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Blaupunk.

46:35.000 --> 46:40.000
Damn, this is a fucking good ride.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
What am I?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Wait.

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
What are you doing?

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
What are you doing?

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
What are you doing?

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Damn, what are you doing?

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
No, wait, don't wait.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Oh, well, okay.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
I tried to.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
All right.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Yo.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
Yo.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
Yo.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
Okay.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
Yo.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Yo.

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
My name is Baby Ice Tea.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
I'm as small as tea can be.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I'm just a small cup of tea,

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
but I'm already as icy as I can be.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
When you add the ice to the C and the E,

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
you get it small as it can be.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
I'm not doing rhymes that are hard.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
I'm just rhyming ice tea.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
But look at me shrinking down.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
I'm a tiny iced tea smaller than an ice cube

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
that you could freeze.

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
I'm going to go out to the streets and try to enemies.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
Try to enemies?

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
I'm your enemy.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Who are you?

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
Giant iced tea.

47:47.000 --> 47:52.000
This universe lacks an imagination.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
What it makes up for.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
In conflict.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Fundamental conflict.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
Yo, I don't see how that conflict could be

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
of any merit.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
When I'm tiny iced tea and you're giant,

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
then you don't watch enough Marvel movies.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Yo.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
My name is tiny iced tea.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
My name is giant iced tea.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
We're in the place to be.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
I tried to fuck your mama with some harmony,

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
but I couldn't do it when my voice switches to between.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
But you have asked to fuck your mama so hard,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
my dick's a bus.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
And my dick's a flea,

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
because I'm little tiny iced tea.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Yo, your dick's a flea.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
Why are you going to use your rap to talk about me?

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
Because I'm big as a tree,

48:42.000 --> 48:47.000
and I don't get away with as much as you do.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Because I'm an underdog.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Yeah.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
That's my power.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
Alright, yeah, you don't have to rub it in.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Don't play the underdog with me,

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
just because I'm an underdog,

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
and it gives me more cue rating than thee.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
You medieval fucking nerd.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
My name is tiny iced tea,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
and you sound a lot like a fucking bully.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
Okay, alright, I'm a bully.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
You win.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
Yeah, well, fucking truth to power.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Motherfucker, my heart is going to stop

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
20 years earlier than yours.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
It labors to get blood up to my brain.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
I'm a giant iced tea, I'm going to fucking die.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
Can't go to the bathroom in a normal place.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
You can go anywhere.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
You're functionally invisible.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
Socially, everyone's on your side.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
I'm giant iced tea.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Yo, huh, I'm giant iced tea,

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
and right about now I'm going to check my IV,

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
my insulin levels are dropping down.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I got to get it.

49:54.000 --> 49:59.000
I don't know why everybody groaned.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Was there a thing in the paper

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
about the real iced tea at the time?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
It isn't.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
We just felt bad for you giant iced tea.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
We just felt bad.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
What's your name?

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
I'm Jack in the B-Stark real estate agent.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
Yeah, I sell B-Starks.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
Do you have anything available

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
for a lonely giant that wants to die in peace?

50:23.000 --> 50:29.000
We call these one way up, no way down B-Starks.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
So you don't say anything?

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
No, it's a tiny iced tea.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Oh, he's not shopping with me.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Yeah, I don't want to...

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I'm not sure I want to hang out with tiny iced tea.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Oh, I love you.

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
He's still paying back rent on that mouse hole I sold him.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Aw, shit.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
Yeah, you know the fuck I am tiny iced tea.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
That's a home office.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
That tiny mice hole is business.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
Oh, okay.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
You can't seem to make tiny mice hole rent money.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
The fucking bubble burst, motherfucker.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Yeah, all right, all right.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
Goddamn, now that fucking Obama's America's

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
gotta be on my shoulders.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
You're always trying to be political

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
when all I want is my money, you little motherfucker.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
Oh, don't side with the split.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
I won't.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
That's a new term I made up.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
We're all...

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Well, fuck him, that little guy.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
Let's get into some of these beanstalks.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Okay, talk to me.

51:24.000 --> 51:30.000
I got $700 in giant money.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
All right, all right.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Let me see if I can speak to one of my other agents.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Oh, shit.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
Johnny Vovado.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Oh, shit.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Johnny Vovado.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Yes.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
This guy busted my balls all day long.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
You wanna buy a beanstalk?

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
Oh, hell no.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
He says he's got 700 giant money.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
Yo, yeah.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
My name is Johnny Vovados.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
My name is Johnny Vovados.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
Tell these people who?

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
My name is Johnny Vovados.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Tell these people who?

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
Um, sold.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Because that is what we do?

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
Those snoop cameos are getting lazier and lazier.

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
Did he even ride?

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
In his defense, he smokes a lot of weed.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Jesus.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
No, I mean, it's a buyer's market right now.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
So, I mean, like, what am I gonna hold out for $800?

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I'll do $700 sold.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Sold.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Yeah.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
All right.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
I'll take it.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
My name is Johnny Vovados.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
My name is Johnny Vovados.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
My name is Johnny Vovados.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
I'm a giant iced tea.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
But right about now, I'm gonna move in for me.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I'm gonna get in and play at the top of the clouds.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
I'm gonna play my music quiet and loud.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
And then I'm gonna make a giant cake and I'm gonna eat it

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
because it's what it takes to make me happy.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I've got an eating disorder.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
It's called bulimia.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
Look it up.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
My name is Johnny Vovados.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
Yo, do you want a few avocados?

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
My name is Johnny Vovados.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
I have a few avocados.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I'd like everyone you have.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I'd like to put them all in a bag.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I only have like four avocados.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
As long as I can eat them when no one's watching.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
All right.

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
Okay, thank you.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Enjoy my avocados.

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
Thank you, Johnny Vovados.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
I'll take this G and climb up the vine.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Looks like the house is already here.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
That's fine.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Are you thirsty?

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
Yes.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
My name is Johnny Vovados.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Are you thirsty?

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
Are you going to wash those avocados down with?

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
Yes.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
I have two Klamados.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
Did you follow me here?

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
I was told there's one way of vines.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
I just, I want the customer to be satisfied.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
But now you have to live here your entire life?

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
My name is Johnny Vovados.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Well, now we're rooming.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Yes.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
Kampados.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
I'll be right back.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
Where are you?

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
That's my house.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I'll be following you.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
I'm going into my house.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Okay, my name is Johnny Vovados.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Are you going to follow me down the street?

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I'm going into my house.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
We're on top of a vine.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
My name is Giant Ice Tea and I'm here to say,

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
here's what's happened up until this minute.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I bought a vine.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
I climbed it.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
My house is at the top of it.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
I'm going into my house.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
As I was nearing the front door,

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
you called from behind me that you had Kalmatas.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Wow.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I'm holding a bag with four avocados.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
That sounds like a great story.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Hey, hi.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Oh God, who are you?

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I'm a golden goose, man.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
I'm hanging out here too.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Shit.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Yeah.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
That sounds like a great story.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Then what happened?

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
What happened then?

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
I went to the market.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
I'll be right back.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Hey, I'm going to come with you.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I need to get some shit.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
There's a market up here?

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Yeah, yeah.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
I was told, oh shit.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
All right.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
I live upstairs.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
I'm so quiet.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
I'm so quiet.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
You won't even know I'm there.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
You probably don't even recognize me.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
You live upstairs in my house?

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
In my house?

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Yeah, in your bedroom.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
You live in my bedroom?

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
Yeah.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Are you mirroring me?

55:33.000 --> 55:39.000
Did you just mirror me?

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
My name is Johnny Pavatos.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
I give you avocados.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Also, you want some shoes?

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
Yes.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Sure.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
They're called Zapatos.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I'll be right back.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I'll be right back when I come up with more rhymes for my own name.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Wait, wait, wait.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
I got to get my phone.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
I'm coming with you.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Okay.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
I just got to find my phone.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
God damn it.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
It's right here.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
I'm going to go up to the front door of my house.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
I left the door open.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
Hi, surprise!

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
What?

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
How you doing?

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Happy birthday.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
It's us.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
We thought we were outside.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
We're inside.

56:17.000 --> 56:24.000
Welcome to your own place.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
We thought we were going to the migrant.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
We were actually inside.

56:30.000 --> 56:37.000
I feel like I got ripped off and bought a house and it's not even my house.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
It's your house.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
We were just leaving.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
We were just leaving.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
Yeah, we're going to leave.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
We're going to the market.

56:42.000 --> 56:46.000
If you look in the fridge, there's like four avocados, a couple of klamatos.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
My name is Johnny Pavatos.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
But the baby died.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Don't touch those.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
Where's my fucking phone?

56:56.000 --> 57:01.000
Also, your dog Walker left a DVD in the DVD player.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
I'm going to check that out.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
It's about black people.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
You'll probably enjoy it.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
I'm going to call the locksmith.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
No, I'm going to call the fucking realtor.

57:12.000 --> 57:28.000
Yeah, are you the guy that sold me the house on top of the vine?

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
I'm a giant iced tea.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
Oh, a giant iced tea.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
How's it going, man?

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Do you love the view?

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Not good.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
What's going on?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I heard you celebrated a birthday.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Yeah, not my birthday.

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
Did you find people living in my house?

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Oh, you met the goose.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
That motherfucker can roll, man.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
Your boss, I think lives with me, too.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
Oh, I forgot to mention that.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
Listen, have a great time.

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
I want to let you know that beanstalk is something that really means a lot to me.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
So I hope you enjoy it.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
It's a rip-off.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
You took my money.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
I should come down that vine and crush you.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Hey, man, it's Trump's America.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
We all just trying to survive, all right?

58:11.000 --> 58:16.000
Now, I used to sell mobile homes before this, and I thought you'd be happy with that beanstalk.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
It's nice.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
It's uphill.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
Not a lot of people up there, and that goose lays golden eggs, and they're delicious.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
I guess my only goal was to come up here and die.

58:27.000 --> 58:32.000
You might want to learn about other people, maybe talk to the people around you.

58:32.000 --> 58:39.000
I wanted to be a fish out of water story where it was thrust upon me like northern exposure.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Or many sitcoms.

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
We all want to be left alone until we're dying.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
That's just how life works.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
All right, I'm not through with you, but goodbye.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Hey, tell that goose I said hello.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
Click.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Hey, I'm back.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Hey.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
Yo.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
Anybody leave any messages?

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
If I fold thumb, I fucked your mama so hard, my dick was a thumb.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I'm a giant iced tea.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
Can't hear you say I'm going to swing on the chandelier and make you gay.

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
By kissing you, take you to the beach like Moonlight 2.

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
It's a sequel with me and you.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
Sorry, I was just rapping.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
Hello.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Did you just make me gay?

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
No, I just...

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
It's a giant culture.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
How do you make everything easier?

59:29.000 --> 59:34.000
It's still okay for a giant to be public.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Hello.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Hello.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Hello, giant iced tea?

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
Yes.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
It's your mother.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
Mom.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
Hello.

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
Mom, is this personal?

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
I told you to hurry up and follow normal-sized Gloria.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Are you talking to your damn son again?

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Yes.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Honey, not now.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
This is business.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I see dad is still up to his old tricks.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
We miss you.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
We haven't heard from you in a while.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yeah, well, it doesn't sound like he does.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Well, guess what?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Here's the newsletter, mom.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I'm still giant.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
No one wants to hire me as a graphic designer.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And it's really fucking expensive to live in Los Angeles.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Why don't you...

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Why don't you just...

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
You can move back home.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
We still have your room here if you want.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Yeah.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Great.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
No, no.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Turn it into a weed room.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Oh, honey, honey.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Hey, the phone knows I'm already...

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Honey, honey, don't get personal.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
This is business.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I'm talking to our son.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Like, son, I know he's not your real father,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
but he's the only father you've ever known.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
What?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
What?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Oh, shit.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
What the fuck?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
You didn't know that?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
No, why would I be upset about his approval if...

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
No, I thought he was...

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Oh, my God.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
No wonder I'm a giant.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Oh.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Yo.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Yo.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Yo.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Yo.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Yo.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
My name is Giant Ice Tea, and I've been a fool.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I didn't know that.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I didn't observe the size of my parents in relationship to me.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Put it together.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I've been fucking mommas in all my raps,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
and now I've fallen into a momma-fuck trap,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
so you can somewhat fuck my momma that was regular size

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
and then adopt me.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
That was a surprise.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I'm gonna find my biological dad.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
That's my new mission.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I'm gonna find my biological dad.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
That's my new mission.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I'm leaving this house, walking along the clouds,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
like Super Mario Brothers.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I can get wherever I'm going faster,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
because I'm walking along the clouds.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I can drop down to wherever my biological father is.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
First, a cursory.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Googling?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Giant Ice Tea?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Oh, that's just...

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I just googled me.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I'm googling the word father.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Okay.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Okay, why did it bother?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I should order some more soy milk.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Honey, should I stay on the line?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Should I hang up?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Sorry, what?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Should I stay on the line?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Do you want your mother to hang up?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
This sounds personal.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Johnny?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I don't know who you are.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I'm sorry.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I'm your mother.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Oh.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
We're just talking like a guy now.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I hadn't hung up yet.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I just wanted to make sure.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Where do you... Where's my biological father's live?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
He's next to me right now.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
You said that he wasn't my father.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
You're biological father.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
And...

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
My name is Giant Ice Tea,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
and that was your waste.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
All right.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Montage of me googling genealogical...

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Hello?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Hello.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
This is Giant Ice Tea.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Yes.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
This is your father.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Jeremy Irons.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
The famous figure that calls it...

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Ironic Times?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
That's so stupid.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I'm so... I'm sorry, dad.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Wait, where are you?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I'm just kidding.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
This is Johnny Varvados.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Click.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
He had a lot of bravado.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
A lot of bravados.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
All right.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Montage in.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I found my genealogical information.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
He lives in 11121, Washington.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Do you need a... Do you need a ride?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Jesus.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Yes.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Okay, come on.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Let's go.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I've got to go...

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I've got to do some shit over there anyway.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Do you fly?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Yeah, man.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Get on me.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I'm trying.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Yeah, well...

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
You're tiny.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
You're like the size of...

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Do you want a ride?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Yeah.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Get on me.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Okay.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Do you want to see my asshole?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Because gold comes out of it.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Yes, and...

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Okay, you got to look real close for the gold.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Okay, all right.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
You got to look real close.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
It's just brown.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
No, no, no.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
No, no, no.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Wait, that's first.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And then the gold will come soon.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
What's that?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Do you see it?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Do you see the gold yet?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Yeah, it's close.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
It's just shit.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
No, no, no, no.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
No, no, no.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Here.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
No, no, no, no.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Here comes the gold.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
First, I'm kidding.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
No, it's so gross.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
No, no, no, no.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
22 minutes later.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
It's everywhere.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
It's everywhere.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Yeah, I'm serious.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
It's just...

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Hey, it's magic.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
You know, it's going to happen.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Just wait.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Actually, you know, I've never done this before.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I've never ever...

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
You've never laid a golden egg?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
No, no, but it could happen.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
No.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
If you have faith.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
If you have faith.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
If you believe...

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I'm tired of it being my fault that everything goes wrong.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
It's fucking the worst.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Everyone else is an asshole.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
The world was stacked against me when I was born.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
It fucking sucks.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Everyone else is just stupid.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
It has no morality.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Ting-ting-ting-ting-ting.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Oh.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Oh.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
That was it.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Oh, my God.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
There's a tiny golden egg here.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Golden egg.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Wow.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
It worked.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
You believed in me.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It's all I wanted.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Wow.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Oh.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Thank you.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Let's get to my father's house.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Yes.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I don't have anything.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
You go without me.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I'm going to watch some shit on TV.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
You can't fly, can you?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
No.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
You know, I didn't think I could shit a golden egg either, to be honest.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And I just did, so...

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Yeah.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Okay.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I'll fly you there.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Man, Amber alert.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
A man presenting himself as golden goose.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Not really a goose.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Don't, don't, don't look at that.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Don't look at that.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
He just paints his poop gold.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Don't, don't, don't.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
No, no, no.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
No, no, no.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
If you, if you are currently holding what you think is a golden egg, you're probably

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
holding golden poop.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
No, no.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Ask the goose if he can fly.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
No, no, no.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Don't ask him.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
That's fake.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It's fake.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It's fake, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, just let's go.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
YAAAHHH!

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
SMASH!

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
He's dead.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000
My name is Giant Iced Tea, here to say I'm going to call an Uber in the usual way.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Bip, beep, boop, boop, V5o.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Uber shows up and away I go.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Driving across the clouds.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Guys playing Armenian music pretty loud.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I can smell his cologne, but I'm gonna see my father won't die alone.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
But I'm here with you too.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Oh shit, Tiny Iced Tea.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Yo.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
It's fucked up, man.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
It's not personal, it's business.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Hello.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Hello.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Giant Iced Tea?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Yes.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
This is your mother again.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I feel like you should know something.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Your father, your biological father?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It's Tiny Iced Tea.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Listen, man, there was never gonna be a good time to say it.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Stop the car, stop the Uber, stop it.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Are you sure you want the, I think I know better.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
No you don't, just stop the car.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Okay, well you're not women, so I'll do what you want.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Yeah, I wrote it.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Where are you going, son?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Please, these are clouds, you could walk forever.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Shut up, leave me alone.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I'm walking behind you as you're marching forward the cameras in front of you and tracking.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
It's one of those shots.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Stop describing it.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
You act like that's something I do all the time.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
No, just shut up, I hate you.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I can't say I love you.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I'm stopping.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Because I don't know you.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
But I want to get to know you.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
If you want to know me, here's what you gotta do.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I'm gonna fuck your mama with my left and right shoe.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
That's a start.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I fuck her with a fart.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I fuck her with a long dart.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I fuck her.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Dance.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Oh, we're dancing.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
We're dancing the same way.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000
The camera's zooming in on me to see the moves that I share with you.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And then I take the moves and I do them when the camera pulls back.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Because we're very different sizes.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I'm trying iced tea.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I'm trying iced tea.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I'm trying iced tea.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I'm trying iced tea.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I'm trying iced tea.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I'm trying iced tea.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Two iced teas in the place to be.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000
In a cloud world, fuck your mama so hot she turned into a girl.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Fucking epic battle of tiny iced tea.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
And giant iced tea.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
It was lower case and capital T.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
It was amazing.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
So many teas.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
So good.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I mean, it went to a dark place.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
It went to a dark place.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
It went to, like, then you don't have the face of somebody that you felt that was wrong.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Yeah, I didn't like it.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I don't like it.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I thought it was kind of meandering.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
There's a lot of confusing breakdowns.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
It takes a little while to get to that darkness.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
But once we got there, it was dark.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
What did we really learn?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
You know what was good was that Ed 209 thing.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
That's what people are remembering.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
They're like, that was kind of like that.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
But it wasn't as good, right?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
No, it was great.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
We'll find out tomorrow.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I just wanted to know what happened to him.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I mean, I guess they're reunited with his father.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
And what else do you do?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Closure.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Wrong song.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
You have to look of, like, it's not completed.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Yeah, I feel like, like, what hat?

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
What's the point?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
You're back with your father.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Who cares?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I think, like, you found out that your father is, like, you're at the bottom of the circle right now.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Now you've got to find out, like...

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Yeah, but I wouldn't want to continue.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I just felt like a clunky property.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Clearly, they move in together.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Yeah, but on a cloud, and it's just clunky.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
It's like, like, the goose lives there, and it's like, I couldn't tell what's going on.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
No, but you killed the goose.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
The goose got killed, right?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Yeah, the goose got killed.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I stomped on him because I got confused.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I just wanted to move on.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I was, like, I was panicking.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I was, like, narratively panicking.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I feel like you didn't make enough use out of those gifts you were given, those avocados and climatos.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I feel like that's an opportunity that's, like, in a video game.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
You go, oh, shit, I combined the avocados and the climatos.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Like, just to get the taste out of my mouth, just do a standard five-minute, just, like,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
and cap, just do a little story, okay?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
But it doesn't have to have music.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
It's not a rap.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Just, like, tell a story from beginning to end.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Starting from where we left off?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
No, no, totally different thing.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Just to clear my palate.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Because it was just, like...

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
All right.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I think you were afraid of where you were getting.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000
You're worried that you were getting somewhere too emotionally raw.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Are you saying he's having, like, a giant flashback?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
You're saying you want to pick up now, you want to do, like, it's years later,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
and giant iced tea and tiny iced tea are living together.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
You pick.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I'll leave it to you.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
All right.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Well, let's do that, because then...

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Okay, so we'll just wrap it up.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.000
So this is, like, the after the credits.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
You want to beat?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
No, no.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
No.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
No.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
This is after the credits.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:10.000
In the news today, there's a thing, a flap on it, it's going around, it's going around.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
This is just a downbeat.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
There's nothing, the news is just happening,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
because otherwise there'd be a scene with someone staring into space.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
That would be weird.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
It's not foreshadowing.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I'm not talking about something important.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I'm not saying there's a meteor with strange contents.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I'm just saying there was a thing flapping around.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
The Dow Jones, there, that's innocuous.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
The Dow, in the news today...

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
All right, doing it again.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
In the news today, the Dow Jones was on a...

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Okay, you won't mistake that for pipe.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Okay.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Oh, I love the Dow Jones.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Son, can I talk to you?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Shit.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Personal business.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I have cancer.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
So do I.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
What if we combine them?

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
What kind do you have?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Why does that matter?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Because I'm not going to combine random cancers.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Fuck, are you a doctor, motherfucker?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I don't have to be a doctor to not want to mix fucking just random...

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Motherfucker, we're doing...

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Fuck you.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Fuck you!

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I don't even have cancer.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Me neither, bitch!

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I have, for real, I have cancer.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Me too.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
What kind?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Testicular.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Prostate.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I don't really have cancer.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Fuck, fuck!

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Now you're going to lose your testicles.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
You piece of shit.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
After everything I've done,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
brought you into this world.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Yeah.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
So?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Now you...

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
So what?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
You don't give a fuck if I live or die, do you?

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Maybe it's not that.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Maybe it's that I don't know what to do with my emotions

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
because you didn't raise me right.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
So you don't want to tell me.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
You tell me.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
You can't even talk.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Can you give me a ride to the hospital,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
motherfucker,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
to get my fucking cancery testicle cut off,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
motherfucker?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Can you do me that?

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
All right, all right.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Jesus fucking Christ, like I asked for the fucking world.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I want to get one nut cut off, motherfucker.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
All right.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
My car's dirty.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
You don't think I know where it is?

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I got a McDonald's bag, motherfucker.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000
All right, get in.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Life's a fruit, bro.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
We both are.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Hey!

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Welcome to the hospital.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I know you.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I drive an Uber during the day.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Welcome to the hospital.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I make a five stars.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
My father has testicular cancer.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
He needs one of his testicles removed.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Well, I'm afraid there's no more health care.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
What do you mean?

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.000
We both voted for Trump.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I'm glad to be in the same page as my son.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
We are both hardcore laborers.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:58.000
We backed the president that would give us less black health care.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Well, you made a mistake.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Let me guess.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
You didn't like it because it said Obama in front of it?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Yeah, you don't have to pigeonhole us.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Psych!

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
That was your health care.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
It was called Obamacare by Racist

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
that wanted you to associate it with the black president.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Now you have to keep your cancer testicle.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Hold on a second.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Here's the news.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Obama's health care is still on.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
You can lose your testicle.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Yay!

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I love Obama.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I found out that racism doesn't really get you anywhere.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Politically speaking, it doesn't.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.000
People who gravitate towards politics are typically conniving.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Average intelligent people have 100 IQs.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
They're not like geniuses.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
They work on Wall Street or be physicists.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:11.000
I guess our country was an experiment that lasted as long as it could before collapsing.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I wouldn't go that far.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Jesus Christ, this is a whole emergency room for the young people out there

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
that would like to hear something different.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
We're not listening to me. You might not be removed.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Dad, I'll give a fuck what they say.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Fuck I love you.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Just hold on. One more snip.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Now this last one is very crucial.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:52.000
You have a 70% chance of survival if you, if when I snip it, snip it.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000
You have a bond with your son.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.000
It's a freak thing about testosterone and the paternal biological axis.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Apparently the incidence of testosterone...

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Sorry, hold on a second.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Maggie, give me that thing.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Here it is, Dr. Shit.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Testicular cancer.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
They started to rise as the government co-opted the father-son bond

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
and infantilized the entire American family and made everyone go to work

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
and raised everyone like they were children, eating Twinkies and watching TV

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
and thinking that fame would end all their problems when actually we're just an Orwellian future

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
but because we're not wearing coveralls it doesn't appear Orwellian.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000
We're wearing like fucking t-shirts from shows we like.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
But that has resulted in a lower sperm count across the American index

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
and also it's also everyone's testicles are rotting away

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
because fathers and sons don't get along with each other anymore.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:00.000
So the point is, when I researched, if you just hold your son's hand and truly love him

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.000
you may survive this testicularctomy.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Well, it's worth a shot.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
All right.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Hand-hold sound effect.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Smorch.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Carry on my wayward song.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
We'll be pleased without you.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Son, I got you a kite.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Thank you.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Can you help me the damn long, damn long way out?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Son, I got you a bicycle.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Thank you.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Don't you cry no more.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Snip.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.660
Ted, no, I love the bike!

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:59.660
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.380
Once I caught into a land of the future

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:07.340
I went into a cornfield and a suture

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:10.840
And if I say that I'm a blind man

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.740
It surely means that I can't see

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:17.740
I put my hat into a sock and a doughnut

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:21.740
I got into a car and I couldn't start up

01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:24.740
I try to drive home from the hospital

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:28.740
Cause my dad just died

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:32.740
Carry on my way home, sir

01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:35.740
Help me peace when you wander

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:44.740
Goddamn!

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:47.740
I just saw you crying, giant

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:49.740
I couldn't believe it

01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:51.740
Yeah, well, whatever

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:56.740
You look like somebody who just lost their father in a testicular accident

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:59.740
Yeah, sure, whatever

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:02.740
Did you get a chance to say goodbye?

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.740
I was there with him till a bitter end

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:08.740
Held his hand, felt his soul slip away

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:12.740
Wow, it's pretty deep

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:19.740
You think you'll be alright?

01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:22.740
Or do I have to sit here and mirror you

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:30.740
When I could be playing a video game?

01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:32.740
Get in!

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.740
Alright, here we go

01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:37.740
Carry on my way home

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:40.740
Alright, that's an ending

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:43.740
Fucking good

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:49.740
Alright, yeah

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.740
Maybe that wasn't an after the credits

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.740
I mean, that was the rest of the movie

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.740
If it had ended up, I'd be like, that was good

01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:57.740
But I couldn't have gone that long

01:22:57.740 --> 01:22:59.740
It would be like Barry Linden, you know

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:02.740
It would be an intermission in the middle

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:05.740
You like that Barry Linden movie?

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:06.740
I haven't seen it

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:08.740
Well, it drags a little bit

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:11.740
They had a special film made for Stanley Kubrick

01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:13.740
Because he...

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.740
Special lights

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:17.740
He didn't want to light it

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:20.740
No, it was a special film too, special film stock

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.740
Don't shake it, no, I saw it on the Goddamn Tivo description

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:25.740
Or whatever you call it

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.740
It's a film, film stock

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:29.740
Yeah, y'all better get y'all Googles out

01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:31.740
Everybody get their Googles out

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:34.740
It was specifically like NASA

01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:36.740
I don't doubt that lenses were involved

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:37.740
For sure they would be

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:40.740
But I also truly believe that I saw a film stock

01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:42.740
Like that he had special film made

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.740
Oh, that's probably...

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:44.740
Yeah, we'll tell him

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.740
I think the crafty was different

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.740
The lens was stuck right there

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:49.740
It kept the image

01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:51.740
Right

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:53.740
Right

01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:56.740
The lens was made for the politicians

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:57.740
That's what he just said

01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:58.740
You guys are obsessed with the lens

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.740
I'm not taking the lens away from you

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.740
You guys are telling me

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.740
All kinds of interesting stuff

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:13.740
But what happened was

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:15.740
I was called a liar for saying film stock

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.740
I'm telling you

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:18.740
He had special film stock made

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.740
I'm sure it had to be like special...

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:21.740
I'm pretty sure it was lens

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.740
Goddamn it, it's not a dichotomy

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:27.740
You can't give me film stock?

01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:29.740
It's not a...

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:31.740
Why does it have to be either or?

01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.740
You can't accept a world where it might...

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.740
Let's go

01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:39.740
So what film stock did he shoot Barry Lyndon on?

01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:41.740
You told me!

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:45.740
The burden of proof is on me

01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.740
Because I'm asserting that something was weird

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:48.740
That's the rule

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.740
Sorry, what?

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:52.740
15mm film stock

01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:55.740
Alright, young Tommy Chong clone

01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.740
So does that mean different film stock?

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:04.740
But 15mm, that sounds made up

01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:10.740
That's what...

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.740
And so I was right

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.740
Because I never said they were wrong

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.740
And their fucking millennial caught up and said

01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:18.740
No, you're viewed, Paul Ryan

01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:20.740
No!

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:22.740
We can all be naked!

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.740
I knew...

01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:28.740
It's not like I would see...

01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:30.740
I don't know anything about shooting stuff

01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:32.740
So I read the description of Barry Lyndon

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.740
For me to perceive the words film stock

01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.740
I wouldn't have then supplanted it

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:38.740
If it said lens

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.740
I would have said lens

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.740
I'm not that gone yet

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:44.740
I saw it on the besides lens

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:46.740
Which they got from that lens

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:48.740
I gave you your lens

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.740
This is why you need bullies

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.740
This is why bullying wasn't mentioned

01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:58.740
Because two nerds will fight indefinitely

01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.740
Until a bully comes along

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.740
Shut up, nerds!

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:08.740
Y'all nerds need to quit this shit

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.740
Help me with my homework

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.740
This could be the worst podcast ever

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.740
If we were just allowed to

01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:16.740
But we could hang out and talk about lenses all night

01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.740
I want to know though, what was it, Heather Hooks?

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.740
It's both?

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:22.740
Of course it's both

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:24.740
Of course you wouldn't change the lens

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.740
And then keep the...

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.740
No, I need that Pan Am Rama film stock

01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.740
But I just need to change the lens

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.740
That's crazy

01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:34.740
He can't give up

01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:36.740
He can't give up!

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.740
You can't give up

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.740
With the film stock doesn't matter

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:42.740
Why would you say that, though?

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:44.740
Why wouldn't the film stock matter?

01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:46.740
Of course the film stock matters

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.740
You're wrong, bro

01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.740
I can tell by the look on your face

01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:52.740
You're wrong, because you're not committed to your disness

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.740
No, he's just so into lens

01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:56.740
He works for NASA

01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:58.740
He works for NASA

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.740
But do he make the film for NASA?

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.740
Film stock!

01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.740
But nobody makes the film anymore

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:06.740
Because it was special film!

01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:08.740
Yeah!

01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:10.740
Special film stock!

01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.740
Dan, Dave Kline just handed me his phone

01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:14.740
Kubrick was determined not to reproduce

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:16.740
the set bound artificially look

01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.740
of other costume dramas from that time

01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:20.740
After tinkering with different combinations

01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:22.740
of lenses and film stock

01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.740
The production obtained three super fast

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.740
50 millimeter lenses

01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:28.740
Developed by Zeiss

01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:30.740
So he experimented

01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.740
with film stock

01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.740
and it turned out to not work

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.740
It's a different type of film stock, too

01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.740
Well, that sounded like

01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:40.740
You're both right!

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:42.740
I'm willing to say I'm wrong

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.740
These lenses were first developed

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.740
by a website called Legs Lab-ish

01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:58.740
We should all go online and check it out

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.740
I was wondering

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.740
Did you

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:04.740
I think probably everyone here

01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:06.740
saw maybe that clip

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.740
of Ted Koppel talking to Sean Hannity

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.740
Is that his name?

01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:12.740
I think you are bad

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.740
But you think we're bad

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.740
You think we're bad?

01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.740
Let me talk!

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.740
I ought to punch you in your

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.740
young face

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.740
And it was he did

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.740
Ted Koppel's baller because he's the only person

01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:28.740
up to that motherfucker on his show

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:30.740
Well the 70s are baller now

01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.740
Woodward and Bernstein are out there

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.740
He doesn't know what side to part his hair on

01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:36.740
He doesn't give a shit!

01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:38.740
Because we're living in this world

01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:40.740
that larger piece I was just watching in the green room

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.740
there was a larger thing that Ted Koppel did

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:44.740
that was just about the fact

01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.740
and we're tired of hearing this

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:48.740
because what does it fucking mean?

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.740
The fact that our relationship with facts

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:52.740
has become

01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.740
it's now subjective

01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.740
we all thought in the 90s

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:58.740
we thought there's going to be all kinds of trouble

01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:00.740
but it's going to be because

01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:02.740
information is going to bleed

01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:04.740
all together

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.740
we all anticipated all kinds of trouble

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:08.740
trouble like I don't know

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:10.740
like kiddie porn will be easier

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:12.740
people will be able to get away with crime more

01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:14.740
then the government is going to want to clamp down

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:16.740
and thought will be a crime

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:18.740
it was all predicated

01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:20.740
there was all this unspoken assumption

01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:22.740
that information had

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.740
some kind of inherent value

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:26.740
it was like gold or something

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:28.740
the truth could be known

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.740
and that the truth was a thing

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:32.740
that you could back the dollar with

01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.740
and you could back political accountability with

01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.740
but we've been slipping

01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:38.740
for a really long time into like

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.740
and this is just so ironic

01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.740
that as the technology of communication increases

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:44.740
you can actually, it turns out

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:46.740
the truth becomes

01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:48.740
like

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:50.740
a boring thing that only when you

01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:52.740
all mist into a poison

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:54.740
and blow it into people's eyes

01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:56.740
a certain way does it make them do things

01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:58.740
like the truth and we should have seen that

01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.740
coming because when I was a kid

01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:02.740
you'd watch the news and if the news anchor

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:04.740
was like Nicaragua you'd be like boring flip

01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:06.740
that country

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:08.740
has got a weird name and I'm like

01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:10.740
the truth is boring

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:12.740
and that used to include things like healthcare

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.740
and all this stuff and we're like we don't

01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:16.740
like it's only people that mash

01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.740
it up and go like

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.740
oh boogie man

01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:24.740
they're getting reactions and clicks

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:26.740
and it's like I don't know what my point is

01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:28.740
I'm just shaking my cane at everything

01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:30.740
Did you see other people who showed up

01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:32.740
that had pizza gate t-shirts

01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:34.740
this weekend in Washington

01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:36.740
because they still believe that pizza gate is real

01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:38.740
even though Alex Jones has come out and said

01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:40.740
I apologize

01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.740
because you only need to hear

01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.740
it turns out, they told me

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:46.740
when I was trying to make my dog not shit in the house

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:48.740
and I was like

01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:50.740
by the way I didn't want to have her own a dog

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.740
because I thought growing up in Milwaukee

01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:54.740
I thought in order to own a dog

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:56.740
it meant you had to be mean to it

01:30:56.740 --> 01:30:58.740
because how else could you possibly train a dog

01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:00.740
to do things in turn

01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:02.740
and then I read books and all this stuff

01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:04.740
and I was like oh you'd never have to have

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:06.740
never, my dogs never experience any punishment

01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:08.740
it's only experience reward

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:10.740
and it shits outside

01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:12.740
I got off on a tangent there, I'm a great dog owner

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:14.740
I went to that breeder

01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.740
and I said give me a great dog

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.740
sorry

01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:22.740
but the thing that I heard

01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:24.740
from the people that come over and go

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:26.740
I was like god damn it my second dog

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:28.740
he's hard to train

01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.740
he's a little fucker

01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:32.740
and I started learning about dog training

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:34.740
and she's like you can't

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.740
people come home, they see a turd

01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:38.740
and they think you take the dog's face

01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:40.740
and you look at the turd

01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:42.740
that dog doesn't know what that turd is

01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:44.740
and the dogs live in the moment

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:46.740
and she was like

01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:48.740
they study this shit

01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:50.740
and there's a window of time

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:52.740
during which a tiny little dog brain

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.740
can learn

01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:56.740
it'll experience all kinds of shit

01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.740
and react to it and it'll seem like your dog

01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:00.740
is sentient

01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:02.740
but as far as really like

01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:04.740
connecting something new

01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:06.740
like making a new thought

01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:08.740
it has to be so much in the moment

01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:10.740
that that's why trainers

01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:12.740
associate they go

01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:14.740
if you want to train your dog

01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:16.740
it's like you click the clicky thing

01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.740
so the dog can piggyback

01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:20.740
the clicky thing means I did a good thing

01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:22.740
the clicky thing also means

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:24.740
I get a peanut later

01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:26.740
whatever dogs are you, I don't know

01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:28.740
milk chocolate right, dark chocolate

01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:30.740
they love dark chocolate

01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:32.740
just a funnel

01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:34.740
hey don't talk over me, it's my podcast

01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:36.740
if you're training a dog at home

01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:38.740
get a funnel and a barrel of dark chocolate

01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.740
and it will not come back to haunt me

01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:42.740
chicken bones, they love

01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:44.740
tiny but tiny chickens

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:46.740
you have to sharpen them first

01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:48.740
hone them to a razor's edge

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:52.740
but for some reason the clicky thing

01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:54.740
the dog will go okay clicky thing means

01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:56.740
I'm owed a cookie, I'll get a cookie later

01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:58.740
whatever they associate it, my point is

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:00.740
okay so we're primates, so our window is a little longer

01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:02.740
okay so Ben Franklin

01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:04.740
could take all that time to discover electricity

01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.740
and connect it to maybe I'll get laid if this

01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:08.740
key glows

01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:10.740
like we have a long term

01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:12.740
but we don't really

01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:14.740
we call it sentience because we can connect dots

01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:16.740
from very far away, we're like

01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:18.740
maybe if I get this car, maybe if I

01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:20.740
blah blah blah, it's like we can connect things

01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:22.740
so much further that we think we're superior animals

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:24.740
but we can't learn piano after

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:26.740
40

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:28.740
are you kidding me

01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.740
it's a mathematical fact

01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:32.740
nothing turns a woman on

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.740
by more than a glowing key

01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.740
we fucking love that

01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:38.740
Ben Franklin

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:40.740
it's just rattling

01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:42.740
the

01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:44.740
the

01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:46.740
but that Ted

01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:48.740
couple thing awoke me to the fact that it was like

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:50.740
awoke me, what am I

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.740
you can't learn

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.740
I knew what you meant

01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:56.740
we

01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:58.740
it only takes a certain amount of time before

01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:00.740
you can encounter something and then you decide

01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:02.740
it's true and you kind of

01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:04.740
it kind of bakes into your

01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:06.740
your brain and we're all

01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:08.740
aware of the fact that

01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:10.740
facts are the kinds of things that can

01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:12.740
be like proven wrong

01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:14.740
and all this stuff but we

01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:16.740
but that's different from things that we believe

01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:18.740
like we have like this kind of

01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:20.740
it's just sad really

01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:22.740
because where were we

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.740
when we learned to be

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:26.740
like whatever we are that kind of

01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:28.740
drives everything else that we do because it's

01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:30.740
driving on how we consume information and then

01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.740
we're certain of things

01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:34.740
I feel like what we just saw

01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:36.740
with these lens nazis

01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:38.740
for it

01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:40.740
just to use it as an example

01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:42.740
it's a it's a thing lens nazis

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:44.740
I'm not

01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:46.740
saying you're anti-semitic I'm just saying if lenses were

01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:48.740
Jews

01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:50.740
Zeishal

01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:52.740
motherfuckers Zeishal

01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:54.740
or a film stock a film stock were Jews you'd be like

01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:56.740
fuck the film stock does not matter

01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:58.740
it's the Zeish the Zeish

01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:00.740
I fuck Vanessa

01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:04.740
the rocket the rocket would take us

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:06.740
to the thing I go oh my god shangha

01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:08.740
my god um anyways

01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:10.740
this

01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:12.740
what we saw is that I was a better person because

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.740
I let them in I was like me

01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:16.740
I was like lenses for sure right

01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:18.740
and they were like

01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:20.740
yeah but fuck your film stock

01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:22.740

01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:26.740

everybody was right we were all right

01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:30.740
but we're not all right when it comes to

01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.740
whether or not you should have a

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.740
horrible dictator in charge of your country

01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:36.740

01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.740
just regular people

01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:52.740
like like we're all like

01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:54.740

I'm gonna fucking kill ISIS I'm gonna

01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:04.740
step it up and we voted

01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:06.740

01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:08.740
now he's we're just we're murdering that

01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:10.740
was the shit that Obama did that he gets

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.740
criticized for is like yeah this is part of being

01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:14.740
president you send a drone and like an Amazon

01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:16.740
thing

01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:18.740
there's a little half a mosque sorry we got the half a

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:20.740
mosque sorry for the half a mosque

01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:22.740
very difficult to draw down troops

01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:24.740
and not use drones

01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:26.740
and so now this dude

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.740
is just like just forget that nuclear button

01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:30.740
I mean don't forget it we're all gonna die that way

01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:32.740
but like in the meantime

01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:34.740
there's a little morphine button that you just get

01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:36.740
hand a drone drone drone drone drone

01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.740
it's not like he was gonna put that in the drawer

01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:40.740
and now the drone drawer

01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:42.740
drone drawer was already open though

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.740
no I'm not

01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:46.740
this is the thing like I don't fucking yeah

01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:48.740
I know people are telling me

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:50.740
oh Hillary in the emails

01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:52.740
and the Obama and Obama did this

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.740
you can hear my podcast

01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.740
goes back years I was never like pro Obama

01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:58.740
while Obama was president

01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:00.740
I hate politicians they're fucking corrupt pieces of shit

01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.740
why did they become politicians now we all

01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:04.740
miss this motherfucker

01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:06.740
it's like it's a corrupt politician

01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:08.740
who cares the country was working and there's

01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.740
a little bit of an admission there where you go like

01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:12.740
I don't care a little bit of like blood from

01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:14.740
poor people I'll never meet and was like

01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:16.740
oh it goes into my toilet paper and my butt

01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:18.740
feels so good

01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:20.740
we do have to own that

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.740
show brown in your butthole

01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:24.740
I swear to god

01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:26.740
he's already seen a white man's butthole

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:28.740
he doesn't need to

01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:30.740
sorry what were you gonna say I derailed you

01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:32.740
well I don't know I mean here's the thing

01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:34.740
it's not like politicians are uniformly

01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:36.740
shit it's that we you know we get

01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:38.740
politicians like we get artists or rock stars

01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:40.740
or singers some are great

01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:42.740
some make you dance and they bring you together

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:44.740
and you fucking celebrate when you see him

01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.740
and some people just sound like bullshit

01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:48.740
they don't hear their songs anymore

01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:50.740
and you want to turn them off but you give them the right

01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:52.740
to do what they do so

01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:54.740
I think

01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.740
you were talking about mirroring earlier

01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:58.740
and this is the deal is that if you do

01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:00.740
actually listen to people with what people are

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.740
saying and you empathize

01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:04.740
you don't rely on the news as much

01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.740
because you hear on the ground

01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:08.740
what's actually going on if you actually listen

01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:10.740
to your neighbor talk to you about

01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:12.740
what's going on in their life and

01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:14.740
you know how hard it is for them

01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.740
if you do that then you turn on the news

01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:18.740
and you see that unemployment is supposedly

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:20.740
not as bad as it is

01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:22.740
then you know that's a fucking lie

01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:24.740
same thing goes for when you listen to politicians

01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:26.740
I look at politicians in a very different way

01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:28.740
because I've always been a democrat

01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.740
so I look at the democratic party

01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:32.740
as a totally different thing than just like a bunch

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.740
of people lying

01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:36.740
that's it

01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:38.740
but what are we supposed to do in Las Files is like

01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:40.740
go over to Amy Mann's house and find out she doesn't like the pot hole

01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:42.740
and

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:44.740
her neighborhood is doing okay

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:46.740
we have a ton of homeless in Las Files

01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:48.740
they live in the park during that

01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:50.740
I almost killed Amy Mann

01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:52.740
she was coming around the corner

01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.740
on avocado and commonwealth

01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:56.740
at the speed of light on a beach cruiser

01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:58.740
she almost drove right into my car

01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:00.740
and she went zoom right past me

01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:02.740
I was like

01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:04.740
I almost killed Amy Mann

01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:06.740
I saw you because she was like

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.740
you almost killed me and you were like

01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:10.740
bitch don't tell me to hush hush

01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.740
keep it down now

01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:14.740
I don't care

01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:16.740
whether your voice is carry or not

01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:18.740
that's a chill Tuesday reference

01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:20.740
only four people in this audience will get

01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:22.740
it's on the flash dance soundtrack

01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.740
you'll love it

01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:26.740
I just got kicked out of all the black sites

01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:32.740
what's going on in black

01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:34.740
twitter can you tell me

01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:36.740
we're pretty quiet right now

01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:38.740
that's been our show thank you

01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:40.740
we're just

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:42.740
waiting to see what y'all do

01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:44.740
we're quiet

01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:46.740
how do I get into black twitter

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:48.740
is it like hogwarts

01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:50.740
do I have to like

01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:52.740
I think you have to walk through a doorway

01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:54.740
but you have to believe in it

01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:56.740
you have fans on black twitter

01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:58.740
well I mean if what you mean

01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:00.740
is that I have a handful of

01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:02.740
very very heroic black people

01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:04.740
that enjoy my work and my podcast

01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:06.740
that doesn't make black people heroes

01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:08.740
I'm biased

01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:10.740
but I feel like

01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:12.740
seasonings are what make black people heroes

01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:16.740
seven original spices

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:20.740
that is the kind of

01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:22.740
down home charm you'll only get on black twitter

01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:26.740
if I said that it would be dismissive

01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:28.740
last night I saved a motherfuckers life

01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:30.740
with some kind of

01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:34.740
I'm a hero

01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:36.740
alright how do we close

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:38.740
a show like this what's going on

01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:40.740
I think we just slowly walk away

01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:42.740
I still haven't picked up my gun

01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:44.740
do they expire

01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:46.740
do the guns expire

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:48.740
do they like

01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:50.740
don't get a gun man

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:52.740
it's still gonna rob you

01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:58.740
it takes heart

01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:00.740
you don't have heart

01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:02.740
I'm gonna be like don't shoot me dad I just want your shit

01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:04.740
all you dumb motherfuckers should have shot me

01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:08.740
I thought I was doing a hilarious bit

01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:14.740
you ain't got no heart man

01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:16.740
we had a meeting at Dan's house

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:18.740
and Dan has Batman cameras everywhere

01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:20.740
you can be in Dan's place and see

01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:22.740
everybody walking up to the house

01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:24.740
so I came up knowing that Dan might be armed

01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:26.740
and I came up

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:28.740
hands in the air

01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:30.740
wearing a suit

01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:32.740
on button my suit stood up

01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:34.740
turned around

01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:36.740
and thinking that everybody would be laughing

01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.740
inside watching it nobody was

01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:40.740
the cameras were on

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.740
you should have said hands up

01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:44.740
nice suit

01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:46.740
hands up nice suit

01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:50.740
no justice

01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:52.740
no pleas

01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:54.740
no justice

01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:56.740
no peace

01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:58.740
no peace

01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:00.740
no peace

01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.740
I thought he said no pleats

01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:04.740
I said no pleats

01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:06.740
you said no pleats

01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:08.740
look I don't want to

01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:10.740
tell you your job for you but I don't know

01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:12.740
what kind of laugh you're waiting for to close the show

01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:14.740
we're never gonna recreate that

01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:16.740
say something

01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:18.740
tell us a hilarious joke

01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:22.740
maybe something racially charged

01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:24.740
I don't know what do you got

01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:26.740
a black guy

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.740
and a white guy

01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:30.740
go into a bar together

01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:32.740
and the bartender

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:34.740
is behind a curtain so you can't tell what race he is

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:38.740
something a good bar

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.740
so you just hear a voice

01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.740
he just says what would each of you

01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:48.740
like to drink

01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:52.740
and the white guy says why are you doing that voice

01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:54.740
and the bartender says

01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:56.740
I'm trying to disguise

01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:58.740
my voice

01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:00.740
I don't want you to know what

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:02.740
race I am

01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:04.740
and the black guy is like

01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:06.740
he sounds to me transylvanian

01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:10.740
and the white guy says that's not a race

01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:12.740
now you're

01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:14.740
on to something what is a race

01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:18.740
and the white guy says I know what a race is

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:22.740
and you give me a free drink if I can prove it

01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:24.740
and the bartender says okay

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:26.740
and the black guy says

01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:28.740
I know what race is

01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:30.740
and I'll give you two

01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:32.740
I'll have two drinks

01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:34.740
I get two drinks if I can prove it

01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.740
and the white guy takes his drink

01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:38.740
and he drinks it and he says race

01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:40.740
is an amalgamation of

01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:42.740
geotypical

01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:44.740
phenotypical

01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.740
genetic traits

01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:48.740
and he goes on and on

01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:50.740
and the black guy says

01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.740
give me my two drinks

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:54.740
and he says race is an artificial construct

01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:56.740
and then he takes the bar

01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:58.740
and he rips it

01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:00.740
like the hulk out of the floor

01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:02.740
and he

01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:04.740
throws it through the wall

01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:06.740
and he tears down the curtain

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:08.740
and the bartender is a dog

01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:12.740
