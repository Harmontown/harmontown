{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, nearing the end of our meltdown comics run, it's sad again.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:22.000\nIt might be the beginning of a whole new thing, nonetheless, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:42.000\nThe following is with Spencer Crittenden and Rob Schrab.\n\n00:42.000 --> 01:01.000\nAre you all right? I just murdered a guy's toes.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:07.000\nI think it's our protest mentor, isn't it? We're talking about protesting, and then I never protested anything.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:16.000\nI'm spitting all over you. It's vodka. Bad start. Bad start. Take charge, Harmon. Fuck you people.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:19.000\nDon't show weakness. What is this? I want to see in the back.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:22.000\nWait, are these new glasses you're wearing?\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:25.000\nThey're one of two pairs of glasses I got. The kids...\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:29.000\nThose look like new glasses, Dan.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:36.000\nA lot of you guys, some of you don't need glasses. A lot of you do. You're 25, I always assume.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:39.000\nI imagine a massive, like...\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:48.000\nI'm 46.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\nSpencer can't make it. Okay.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:56.000\nCan I just have an empty chair?\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:59.000\nI don't know, it feels wrong.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:03.000\nWho's in my living room right now?\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:08.000\nOh. Okay, fine.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:13.000\nNow you know the backstory.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:18.000\nShe's outside the window.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:22.000\nA lot of you are just straight up myopic or something like you. You have bad eyes. You were born with them.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:27.000\nWe've been tampering with evolution for a while.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:34.000\nWhat does your eyesight do to get you non-reproductively viable in the First World Empire,\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:38.000\nwhich has been raging for long enough to spread a lot of bad eyesight?\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:40.000\nHow did you know when Caveman's eyes went bad?\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:43.000\nCaveman didn't live till past 20 anyway.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:50.000\nWhat I'm saying is, my audience, you're probably born with bad eyes. You're Harmon fans.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:58.000\nI, 2020, solid gold carrot, night vision fucking, like, see-through walls all the time.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nI have what's called a stigmatism.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nMy eyeballs aren't perfectly round. Whoop-de-doo.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:08.000\nSo the next time you're telling me white privilege, fuck you.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:11.000\nThere's some shit you gotta deal with.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nMy eyeballs are not perfectly round.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:19.000\nApparently that means as I get older, now I'm 44, so as I get older now,\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:24.000\nmy vision is getting worse from both ends.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\nSo I'm not blowing anyone's mind with this. It's just frustrating.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nIt's like a Louis C.K. bit or something.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:31.000\nYou just have this conversation with an optometrist.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nSo what are you saying?\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nThey go, like, look at this. Now look at that with the lenses.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:37.000\nAnd they go, okay, so here's the thing.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:40.000\nThe reason your phone's blurry is because you can't see some stuff up close.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:45.000\nThe reason the sign's blurry far away is because some stuff really far away.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nSo you want two pairs of glasses?\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.000\nWhat? Excuse me, what?\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.000\nBad eyesight. Jesus Christ.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:55.000\nSounds like you're talking about some bad eyesight.\n\n03:55.000 --> 04:04.000\nWhat's amazing, you guys, no spoilers, but this is all elaborate me undies ad.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:07.000\nSo I'm wearing, I decided, I don't know why.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:11.000\nI got two pairs of glasses. One's for reading, so I can look at my phone.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:15.000\nThese are for, literally, the purpose of these is so that I can read to Cody\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nwhen she's taken her contacts out the forensic files,\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nsummaries on the TV.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nThat's the only use that these have, but I've been wearing them around\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nbecause I'm told by some people, like, well, you're supposed to wear them\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:31.000\nso that your eyes adjust. I don't, I hate it.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:35.000\nThey're like $300 frames. They're Johnny Varvatos.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:38.000\nI thought they were Johnny Varvatos.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nThe very one.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nIs he out? Did he fucking make bail?\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:49.000\nHey, Johnny. Hey, Johnny, man. Hey, Johnny.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nI think he's the last Ramon, right?\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:55.000\nHey, Johnny. Johnny, my man, Johnny.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:59.000\nWant an apple? Hey, Johnny. Come over and get some apples, Johnny.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:06.000\nJohnny, free apples for Johnny Varvatos. Everybody.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:09.000\nWhere's my special glasses? Why are you drinking from the red solo cup?\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nI put them on my shirt because I don't eat them.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:14.000\nNo, no, you're red, you're solo cup. You're Jane Cook glasses.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nOh, those glasses. Oh, yeah.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nYeah, well, where were those?\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nOh, maybe they were stolen. Started Kickstarter.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nI don't know. I don't know where they are.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nWe'll find out.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nThey're being scuttled out.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:34.000\nA lot of fuckups. That's why we're leaving.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:37.000\nWell, we're gonna, for the next couple of weeks we are gonna,\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nit's not tonight. There's nothing special tonight.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:44.000\nBut I'm sorry, I keep spitting. I'm sorry, the gobs have spit.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nThey don't sit there because they don't want to get spit on.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:49.000\nWell, but it's not, but it's, they don't know.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nOkay, here's, I don't want to derail the show,\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nbut if anybody has like a small pair of scissors,\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nwe've done this before. We did it in San Francisco.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:58.000\nHonestly.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nWe just want to do a small tracheotomy.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:04.000\nJust the walrus hairs coming out of it.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nCan Paul the whip guy in the front row,\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\ncan you whip his mustache hairs off?\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nNo, don't do that.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.000\nUh, anybody, does anybody have mustache scissors on them?\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\nI got my ears and nose waxed today.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nBecause it's gonna keep happening otherwise.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:23.000\nBecause I drink and then it, and then it, these are, that won't work.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nAny takers?\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:32.000\nAlright. Or a straw.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nOr a match. A straw.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:35.000\nA match.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nA knife.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nUm, alright, well let's keep the show rolling.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.000\nLet's keep it rolling.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:47.000\nAlright, so I want to, what, what was the,\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nwhat happened with United Airlines today?\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nSomething happened where there was like a family\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nthat was barred from getting on.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nAll I know is I saw Twitter line up and the,\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nthe end result of what I saw was it seemed like America,\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nAmerican parents were divided down the middle\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\non how old their daughters should be\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nbefore they could be regarded as too hot to get on a plane.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nWhat?\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nNo, it was, I saw a headline that said\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\ntwo, two women were not allowed on because of leggings.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nBut it was like employee, they were past passengers\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nwhich meant that they were employees of United,\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nlike they were flying for free\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:18.000\nbecause they were friends of the company or something.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nSo it was a more archaic dress code\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nthat they employ for, they have a higher standard\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:25.000\nfor friends of the airline that get on the plane.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nBut it's like, it just called everybody's attention\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nto like this weird archaic thing.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nLike in this random incident really,\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nyou're talking about probably a short fuse blown\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nby somebody who's just like, like,\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nhey, what, close your legs, Missy.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nI mean, if we, if we, if we haven't seen\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\ndisgusting shit on an airplane by now,\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:43.000\nwhat country are we living in?\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nLike, I, I...\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:48.000\nGerard, Gerard de Bardoux peed in first class.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:49.000\nI would, I would like...\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nHe's not in Guantanamo right now.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:54.000\nI would like to open the books about what's allowed\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:57.000\non an airplane as far as like fashion is concerned\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nand things like that.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nI'd like to, I'd like to...\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:02.000\nYou know, but I don't want to, like,\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:03.000\nmaybe your feet are really tired.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:04.000\nI don't want to tell one gross person,\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:05.000\ndon't take off your shoes.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nLike, like, like, because, like,\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:08.000\neven though I don't want to look at your feet\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nat the same time, I don't know,\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nairplanes are a hard place to be.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:12.000\nSome lady put her feet on your head.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:13.000\nOne thing's for sure,\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nwe don't all look like a Mormon choir\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:15.000\nwhen we get on the plane.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nLike, we're fucking, like, everybody puts on their sweat pants\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:24.000\nand yoga pants and hats and leg braces and...\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nI transform into a pickup.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nUh...\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:30.000\nAre you iron-eyed?\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:33.000\nI'm part of a larger set of toys\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nthat you can only get at Christmas.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nIt's like 35 bucks for it.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nThere's me and there's a helicopter\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nand we all attach to the airplane.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:41.000\nIt's not cool like Voltron.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nIt doesn't turn into a robot,\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nbut it turns into a big, giant, clunky airplane\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\nthat has a pickup truck on the top.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nMy parents are divorced.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:55.000\nIt's a bad Christmas.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\nThis is just 80s humor.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:57.000\nJust, uh...\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nAll right, let's bring up Brandon Johnson.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nYay!\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:12.000\nIf you need a suit, come to Johnny Vaughn bottles.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:17.000\nGet your suit down here at Johnny Vaughn

Twitter feed, there are people arguing.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:27.000\nThey're going like,\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nbut she was 10 years old.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:29.000\nThat's not a teenager,\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:30.000\nbut it was like the original thing.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nAnd then there were people posting...\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nI saw a guy post a picture of his 10-year-old daughter\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:35.000\ngoing,\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nhere's my 10-year-old daughter in leggings.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nIs that obscene?\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:38.000\nAnd I was like,\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nall right, slow down.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nA creepy Uncle Mark.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nThat's not your daughter.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nIt's just like...\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:48.000\nIt's just like the sound of permission\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nrang out to a certain demo.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nAnd they said,\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\noh, what if they're 10 years old\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nand they're too sexy for leggings?\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nYou know in America,\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.000\nwe're sort of like,\n\n09:58.000 --> 09:59.000\nwould I fuck it?\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:02.000\nWould I don't care?\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\nBut it's kind of like...\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nObviously you would not fuck that joke.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nThat joke is ugly.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nBut there is a really weird thing.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:15.000\nIf you put that joke in some leggings, though.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:20.000\nOne of my favorite non-pornographic little areas\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nI visit on YouTube,\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nlegs lavish,\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:24.000\nwhich is,\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nhosiery reviews,\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nforeign by women.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:31.000\nI'm sure it is.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nI don't think a lot of their audience is women.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nBut it's like,\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nit's not...\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nI mean,\n\n10:37.000 -->

not...\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nThe rules of pornography are really weird.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nFamously, they're totally subjective.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:49.000\nAnd YouTube pulled...\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:50.000\nThey pulled somebody...\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nAlso, it's just about who complains about what.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nLike, all of a sudden one day,\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nlegs lavish was like shut down\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nbecause somebody was like,\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nI just think that's a really funny thing\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:01.000\nto be simultaneously on the side of purity\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nand basically confessing\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nthat you recognize something as sexual.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nIt's its own kink.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nWhoever smelt a delta should definitely apply\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nto pornography.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nBecause the Supreme Court judge that famously said,\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nhe said,\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nI don't know pornography.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nI don't know what...\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nI know it when I see it.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nAnd that's a fair enough...\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nThat's probably the most judicial thing you can say\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nwhen you're policing something like pornography\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nand basically...\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nThat was the famous case of Smelted vs. Delta.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:29.000\nWell, isn't that where the Dalmatian video\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:30.000\nfrom the community...\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nThe guy...\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:34.000\nHe got shut down because of the same thing.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nAnd it wasn't because of us, I don't think.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nNo.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nIt wasn't because we drew attention to it.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nIt was shut down before that.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nLegs lavish?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nIt's hosiery reviews for women by women.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nAre the legs...\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:47.000\nThe legs are lavished in hosiery.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nWhich they can be.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nThey're British.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nAre the legs lavishing things?\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:58.000\nNo, their legs are being lavished with high quality hosiery.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nThey should be called lavished legs.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nAnd they're telling you whether or not you should buy them.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nHarmonies are right for a pipsite.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nThese legs are lavished.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nWith hosiery.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:11.000\nOccultremont, if you will.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nThank you.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:16.000\nI subscribed to Brandon's porn site\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\ncalled Upscale Nation of Islam.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nFor the ladies.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nWhy just have one small clip on bowtie?\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nWhy don't have better bowties?\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nWe call it bean pies made by these thighs.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nAll your Muslim needs...\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:42.000\nStopped a man, but you don't want to get arrested?\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nThis tasteful librarian from the 30s will teach you how.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:53.000\nI ain't down for this shit, but I also might work at Brooks Brothers.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:57.000\nWe can't always be like, you know, British rock cool.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nSome of us...\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nThat's a compliment, goddammit!\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nMan, y'all look tricky tonight.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nI knew this bowtie was a failure!\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nBut it's one of those rare nights where you and I are both dressed up.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nSometimes it's usually one or the other.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.000\nYeah, I usually wear an orange suit, jump suit, big...\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nBig footies.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:23.000\nI see you picking up trash in that 101.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nBut you are always stellarly dressed.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nRound of applause for Jeff Davis.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nThat's what you do right before you put somebody down.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nBecause queers need love.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:40.000\nThat was like a classic roast setup.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nBack when it was funny to be queer.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nYou can order the roast videos.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nAnother thing that's been phased out that you kids should be grateful for.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:55.000\nSometimes at the drawing room you take a little trip back in time socially.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:02.000\nI was told I was a lucky guy today because I was with my girlfriend.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:07.000\nYou know, millennials may not hear you're a lucky guy as much because it seems...\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:11.000\nIt means I want to fuck your girlfriend in front of you.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:14.000\nAnd you're too ugly to fuck her.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:20.000\nCongratulations on the acquisition of something out of your league.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:28.000\nIt kind of just offends everybody except possibly hypothetically a woman with incredibly low self-esteem\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:33.000\nwho might be standing there being told that the man she's currently fucking is luckier\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:38.000\nthan the man who's saying to the other man in front of her, I'd like to fuck her.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nWhat was your response?\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:42.000\nThank you.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:57.000\nShe has her moments.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:04.000\nEvery day of my life is the first eight minutes of a horror movie set in the Appalachians.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nI just don't want anyone to eat me or beat me up.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:13.000\nI just want directions to the next gas station so I can keep that movie from crossing the threshold.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:16.000\nYou're a lucky guy.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:17.000\nThank you.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:18.000\nThank you, sir.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nAnother drink, please.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:21.000\nJust keep making TV.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nThey won't eat you.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nI am a lucky guy.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nI am a fucking lucky guy.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:36.000\nLike, you'd have to be less lucky than me to be offended quickly enough to be a gentleman\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nand go, excuse me, sir.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nI mean, who's going to take somebody to school?\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nI mean, he was 70.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:46.000\nYou're doing the cold open to get out right now, by the way.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nI'm the only person that hasn't seen Get Out yet.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:53.000\nI want to start like a little group.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:57.000\nWell, they hate you for not having seen it.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.000\nThey're actually mad that you haven't seen it.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:04.000\nBut my screener from Moonlight came and I watched it right away.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:09.000\nYou will watch a man jerk off another man.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:13.000\nBut you will not watch a man escape to freedom.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nHe's got you.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nHe's got you there.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nBecause there's no screener.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nHe's got you there.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nHe's right.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nEnjoy your privilege.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\nYep.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nEnjoy your privilege.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nI will say Moonlight, definitely.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.000\nWait, what one best director?\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:38.000\nLa La Land.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.000\nSee, that's a big step.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:40.000\nMoonlight, I didn't see La La Land.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nI'm white enough.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:47.000\nI've seen the art for it and I just know that's going to make me golf.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:53.000\nI don't need that in my life.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:57.000\nI'm still trying to get Moulin Rouge out of my ear.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:02.000\nBut I thought that Moonlight was brilliantly directed.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nI don't know from La La Land.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:05.000\nI don't know.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:08.000\nI guess it's hard to direct people going La La's and stuff.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:16.000\nIt is definitely like this was directed well, kind of screams off of Moonlight.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:24.000\nI have a pet peeve about slice of life movies because I work so hard all day trying to figure out what should happen next.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:29.000\nAnd then when shit just kind of lays out and you leave the movie on, that was well directed.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:32.000\nThere's a part of me, the writer part of me is like, you better not give the best picture.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nYeah.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:38.000\nBecause it takes more, you're going to do that plus.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:43.000\nBut it was like, so the patience and the, you know, where the camera was and also like the more, yeah, whatever.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nI'm not going to tell you why Moonlight was good.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nWhat the fuck am I doing?\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nI was impressed though.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:57.000\nIt passed like this incredible litmus test because I like hit the wrong button and I think my dog sitter might have put Moonlight in the Blu-ray player.\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:58.000\nSomething some happened.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:02.000\nThat's why I was like half drunk and like I hit a button and Moonlight started playing.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nI had no idea what the fuck it was.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:09.000\nI like had one sock on and was like.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:12.000\nYou accidentally watched Moonlight.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nYeah, like seven minutes.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:25.000\nHe accidentally watched Moonlight because his dog sitter might have put it in there.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:30.000\nWhat's it going to take to get him to see get out?\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:34.000\nI don't get that reference, but I'm sure something terrible happened.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:38.000\nI got to drink a bowl of cum.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:41.000\nThe way horror movies have been going, there's like one moment in every horror movie.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:45.000\nThere's always a thing.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nThere's always a bowl of cum.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nDon't breathe.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nDon't breathe.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nIt has a bowl of cum in it.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nSpoilers.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nWait.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.000\nWait, they can't breathe because they have a mouthful of cum.\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nIt's not why they can't breathe.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nI can't breathe.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nThey can't breathe because.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:05.000\nI can't breathe.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nI can't breathe.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nSir.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nSir.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nYou can't breathe.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nI can't breathe.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nI also didn't ask you to drink that bowl of cum.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nI've almost finished.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nThat was for my guests.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nWe're supposed to be here robbing a blind man.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:22.000\nWhy did you bring a bowl of cum?\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:26.000\nYou can breathe.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:30.000\nWell, now I feel stupid.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nLet's go rob that blind guy's house.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nDon't you think, I've heard blind people can hear better.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:38.000\nWell, you know what makes you real quiet?\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nNo.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:42.000\nLet's open that cooler in the back seat.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:47.000\nWhat are these three bowls of what looks like coconut milk\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\nand what smells like paper mache?\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:56.000\nYeah, that's what it is.\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:01.000\nTastes like pineapple.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:05.000\nI feel so racist because I'm picturing little Asian bowls\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\non like beautiful ice like a seafood buffet.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nAre you saying that's racist because you're imagining\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:16.000\nwhite people cum in smaller portions?\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:20.000\nLet's settle this right now.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nI'm racist.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nI'm picturing these little bowls.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nIt was the bowls.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nThat doesn't make you racist.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nThat doesn't make you racist.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:32.000\nThat makes you art department.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:37.000\nAnd that makes you homophobic.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nWhen I was a kid, I had a friend named Kent who,\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:44.000\nhe was a white dude and he was a freaky ass white dude\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nand we were all jumping up on the mattresses\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nand he was like, let's get naked.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nSo we get naked.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:53.000\nWe get naked and he's like spread your ass cheeks.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nI've never seen inside of black dudes.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:59.000\nBut at which point, don't act like this hasn't happened\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nall of us.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nSo at which point...\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:09.000\nDan hasn't seen get out yet, so...\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:13.000\nSpoiler alert.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nI feel like I'm not even going to finish my story now.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nI'm just going to leave you motherfuckers right there.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nNo, no, no, no, no, no. Finish the story.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nI'm going to walk you back.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:21.000\nHow old are you at this point?\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nI was 18.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:26.000\nNo, I was...\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nI had to be, I was about five.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nI was about five years old.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nSo I do my duty.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nYou know, I'm doing the right thing.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nYou know, I spread my butt cheeks.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nYes.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nSo I go, motherfucker, your turn.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nYour turn.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:42.000\nSo he spread his butt cheeks and he had toilet tissue stuck.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:49.000\nAnd I thought, don't, don't, don't be grossed out yet.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:50.000\nHold your roll.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:53.000\nSo I thought, oh my God, if brown people poop brown,\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:58.000\nwhite people must poop white.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:05.000\nJust like the plot of Get Out.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:09.000\nSo you said he had white poop stuck in his white butt.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nWhat else was I supposed to think?\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:15.000\nI mean, the story, just like you say,\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nwhite poop stuck in his white butt.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nLike, it's like something, it's like something\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:22.000\nFred Sanford would say to somebody to kick him out.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\nHe'd get the fuck out of here.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nTake your white poop and your white butt,\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:33.000\nand get the fuck out.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:37.000\nI mean, your story asks a lot more questions than an answer.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nWell, I'd like to know more about this friendship.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nNot that we all didn't have, like we were,\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nthat's what childhood happens.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:44.000\nAnd, you know, like...\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:45.000\nAnd then what happened?\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nWhat happened exactly?\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:49.000\nThat's why we watched Transformers.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nRight, right.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nWe continued to jump on mattresses.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nBut naked or did you get re-robed and...\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nI mean, at that point I was freaked out.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:56.000\nWe got re-robed.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:57.000\nNo, we stagnated.\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:00.000\nSo, he was like six years old,\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nbut he was playing the race card.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:05.000\nLike, he said, he like made it racial\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nbecause he wanted to see your butthole.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nIt's true.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nIt's very early, it starts.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nThat's pretty villainous.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nI guess pretty villainous.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nBut don't, Dan, don't just...\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nHe's not saying that I think my butthole's better\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:16.000\nthan your butthole.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nHe's saying I...\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:20.000\nI guess he's a kid and he's using whatever he can use.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nDon't you think he would say,\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nI've never seen a short person's butthole?\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nExactly.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nI've never seen a blonde person's butthole.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:29.000\nConsciousness of race may be present\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:33.000\nin very early youth, but it's not always sinister.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:36.000\nI was picturing it as like, he was abusing a power dynamic.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:37.000\nLike, he was like,\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:40.000\nI've never seen a black person's butthole,\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nso now show it to me.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nNo.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:43.000\nComplete me.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nNo.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nI showed it to him and he said,\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:47.000\nyou're really a lucky guy.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:52.000\nYou're a lucky fucking guy.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:57.000\nAlso, what Brandon hasn't told you,\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.000\nis the story takes place on the catamaran in Cancun.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:08.000\nI'm trying to remember...\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nIt's a great way to lick a somebody's butthole.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nLike, you can just pretend that...\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nWe showed each other our dicks, like, a lot.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nLike, I said that,\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nme and Brian across the street when we were like that age,\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nwe had...\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nI don't remember what penis parties were,\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:25.000\nbut I remember telling my parents about penis parties.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nI think it was just me and Brian from across the street.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nWe would run into the bushes,\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:32.000\nI think we'd just pull out our junk and like,\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:38.000\nour junk, what am I, a skateboarder?\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:42.000\nWhat am I, a Comedy Central show?\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:46.000\nOur cocks, our hard six-year-old cocks.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:51.000\nTungsten, fucking...\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nBut the thing that sticks out of my memory\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nis just telling us we would run giggling,\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nbecause we thought the word penis was funny\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:58.000\nand the alliteration and stuff,\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nand then we were like, we just had a penis party\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:01.000\nand our parents being like,\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:05.000\nit's the 70s, okay.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nYour parents were like, sort of the way, but different.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:10.000\nYeah, yeah, get out of here.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:14.000\nWe were having a fondue pineapple fucking...\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:17.000\nin the match game, and it's fucking.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:20.000\nNo, it wasn't.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nMy parents were the same as they are now.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:25.000\nThey just wore like shower curtains.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nAh, the 70s.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:32.000\nHey, do you guys think United should let little girls\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nwith leggings...\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:37.000\nI don't know, okay, alright.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:40.000\nOh, today is the 75th anniversary\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nof the flash dance reference\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:45.000\nthat you see in every fucking animated movie\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:48.000\nthat nobody knows what it is.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nAsk them if they know what it is.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:51.000\nThey don't.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:52.000\nListen to their silence.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.000\nEvery time there's a fucking animated movie\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:55.000\nthat involves dancing,\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nan animated character will go over to a chair\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nand it will cut to a side view of them\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nand they'll pull a chain and water will come down.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:04.000\nThat is a reference to a 1930s Lumiere Brothers movie\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:08.000\ncalled Flash Dance that none of us, me included,\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:11.000\nhave ever seen, and they just keep referencing it.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nAnd because the director of those movies\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:14.000\nthat you're watching are my age,\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:17.000\nand they grew up on references to that movie.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nReferences to it.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nIt's Flash Dance.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:26.000\n75th anniversary of that reference makes no fucking sense.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:29.000\nWait, what did you recently see that referenced in?\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:30.000\nThat sing movie.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nYou know, there was an ad,\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nthere was like a billboard with a pig,\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:35.000\nthere's water coming down on the pig.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:39.000\nNick Roll's character.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:42.000\nAnd then I was sitting in the rustic inn today\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:45.000\nand Shrek 9 was playing over someone's shoulder.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nAnd I saw like a chipmunk was like,\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nI love these cookies and he helps her dance about them\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\nand then water came down.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nI don't know what Shrek it was.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:55.000\nThey probably do it in every Shrek.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\n75th anniversary of that bit.\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:00.000\nDo you think like the last Shrek\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nwas doing references to the first Shrek?\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:03.000\nCould be.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nDon't know.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:05.000\nCan't tell my Shrek's part.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:06.000\nWhy was that bad?\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nI got groaned.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nOh God.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nWhat happened?\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:12.000\nWhat happened?\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nI've never seen a Shrek.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:15.000\nI've never seen the Shrek's.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nNot the first one.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nI've seen.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nIt's no get out.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:30.000\nI watched Dead Ringers today with Jeremy Irons.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:31.000\nHe came over?\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nNo.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:38.000\nMe and Jeremy Irons.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:41.000\nWhy didn't you invite me over too?\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:44.000\nYou just have movie dates with Jeremy Irons?\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:47.000\nCome on, let's watch it.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nWhen was the last time you said it?\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nWell, it's the premiere.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nThere's another thing in this Shrek thing\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nthat I saw in the bar over someone's shoulder.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:56.000\nThey were doing a walk and talk\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nand it was like a mall\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:01.000\nand they were walking past malls, medieval malls.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nSo the joke area is obviously,\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nokay, they're in a mall,\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nbut it's like fairy tale times.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nAnd there wasn't even three of them.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:11.000\nThere was just one that said versarchery.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nYou've got to work harder than that.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nYou've got seven years to write these jokes.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nWait, was that like Versace?\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:18.000\nYeah.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.000\nVersarchery?\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nYeah.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nI was saying even,\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nand then the table was going like,\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nI mean, come on, throw it to a room.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:28.000\nYou get years.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nIt wasn't like it was built into the plot.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:33.000\nIt was like that joke is the last thing you can write.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:34.000\nAnd then we were like,\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nokay, well, what do you do?\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:36.000\nMedieval malls.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nAnd I was like, forever 21.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:41.000\nAnd then Cody said, forever 12.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nWhich was really funny.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nWay too funny for a Shrek movie.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:48.000\nForever 12 like fucking cracked me up.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:52.000\nYou go to a mall in medieval times and it's forever 12.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:55.000\nIt's really, really dark and funny.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nIt's funny in layers.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nIt hits you in waves how funny that is.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:02.000\nForever 12.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nIt's so dark.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:07.000\nAnd then you're like, it's dark about consumerism.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nIt's dark about our youth worship.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nIt's dark about life expectancy.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nIt's dark about...\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:16.000\nIt's also a story that's sponsored by United Airlines.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nYeah.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:22.000\nI thought it was like only the 12th version of forever.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:25.000\nBut now we're already up to forever 21.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:28.000\nAnd in 10 years, there'll be forever 31.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:31.000\nSo that joke was funny on multiple levels.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:35.000\nEven the people who have maybe a little learning disability.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nKill City.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:46.000\nI'm sorry, I'm just trying to think of more medieval mall stores.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nArmorani.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:49.000\nWhat?\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:50.000\nArmorani.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nArmorani?\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:52.000\nArmorani.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nI mean, that's as good as Versus Archery.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nYeah.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:59.000\nMy thing was I would just, you know, my bag of tricks.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nI'm Dan Harmon.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:04.000\nI would have just kept Versa Archery, done Armoranery.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:07.000\nAnd then the third one would have been like a word play clearing house.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nHalf off.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:12.000\nGoing out of business.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:15.000\nAnd it was like, work less hard, be more meta.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nEveryone will say you're smart.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nYou're actually just less funny.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:24.000\nAlso, you could throw in a Johnny Varvatos.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:28.000\nThere could be Ye Old Republic instead of Banana Republic.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:32.000\nInstead of the Gap, maybe the Gout.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:33.000\nThe Gout.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:34.000\nThe Baby Gout.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nThe Baby Gout.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:38.000\nWhat about Gout for Kids?\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:42.000\nIncredibly heavy Brookstone.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:45.000\nBecause I don't know, maybe rocks were bigger back then?\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nBecause it's in the, it's in the Brook.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:50.000\nSo it's, but Brook Boulder, Brook Boulder.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nAnd then you go home and you research erosion.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:56.000\nAnd you're like, oh, it became a stone by modern times.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nBrook Boulder.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:03.000\nWhat about hot dog on a tree?\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:07.000\nBecause they didn't know stick technology, by the way.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:08.000\nYeah.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.000\nBefore access.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:10.000\nYeah.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:14.000\nThe second, the second store is, is like a Home Depot, but it's under construction.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:18.000\nBecause they're like, we don't even have the shit to build the Home Depot.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:21.000\nMuch, much less get this hot dog off a tree.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:25.000\nWe save this fucking movie.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nThis movie is no Simpsons signs.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nThose are the best signs in the business.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:30.000\nWhich signs?\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nSimpsons.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nOh, Simpsons signs.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:33.000\nYeah.\n\n31:33.000 -->

Simpsons.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:45.000\nIt's hard.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nIt's not easy, folks.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nJokes is hard.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:54.000\nYeah.\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nThe shittiest complaint ever.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:57.000\nJokes is hard.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nMan, he jokes is hard, man.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:02.000\nI'm out there giving that crowd everything I got.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:03.000\nOoh.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:04.000\nOoh.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:07.000\nSomebody's shit is sad.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:12.000\nDid you ever get the, I was so bad at stand up in Milwaukee.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:16.000\nLike, I often, the guy that, the, when the host would come up after me, I'd often hear,\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:19.000\ncome on, folks, keep it going, comedy isn't easy.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:24.000\nLike, that, and I'd be like halfway to my seat.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nLike, because sometimes I think I killed.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.000\nI was like, like, I don't know the difference yet.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:32.000\nI'm, I'm this bad because I haven't done it more than three times.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nSo that was the best time.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.000\nComedy isn't easy.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:38.000\nWell, maybe he just wanted them to know that.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nOh.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nOh.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nMm-hmm.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:47.000\nI hope that motherfucker's watching community right now.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:48.000\nIt's canceled.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:49.000\nIt's canceled.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:50.000\nIt shows no.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nGood night.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:55.000\nHe can't even, he can't even watch it.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nOr no, Hulu bought the.\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:58.000\nThere we go.\n\n32:58.000 --> 32:59.000\nHulu.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:00.000\nOh yeah.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:01.000\nWatch Hulu.\n\n33:01.000

they did.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nThey bought, so they have them all now.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nHulu, you can watch all the communities.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:16.000\nThere you

therapy.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:26.000\nBut, or no, I didn't yet.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:32.000\nBut I had a, I got, I got instructions that I think that I.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:36.000\nI mean, like I, what I mean is I was told something in therapy\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:39.000\nthat I think, that I recognize as being the most important thing\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:42.000\nto improve my life.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:43.000\nWhat?\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:50.000\nThat's the funniest thing you've ever seen.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:53.000\nOh guys, he looked at his phone for a minute.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nOh, I had a breakthrough in therapy.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:56.000\nOh wait, no.\n\n33:56.000 --> 34:04.000\nNo, I'm sorry, I didn't yet.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nComedy isn't easy.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:11.000\nBut I, what I mean is I got the tools now\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.000\nto learn how to use them.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nLike I walked out and I was like, yeah, I got it, I got it.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:15.000\nIt's the word mirror.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nIt's the, it's the thing that I haven't been doing.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:21.000\nI always thought when you talk to people, like the reason it's exhausting\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nis because you're putting energy into them.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:28.000\nSo somebody goes like, oh, my hair is important.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nAnd then you, you're like, you just, you think in your head,\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nyou go like, you're a fucking vampire.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:36.000\nAnd you're, and it's like, how do I look at you\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nwithout feeling your soul screaming?\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:43.000\nAnd, but, but you, like, like, that's not your job.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:46.000\nYou don't have to put, you don't have to give up your own energy.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nYou've become a mirror.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:49.000\nThat's what you're supposed to do.\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:50.000\nYou're supposed to, but I haven't done it yet.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nI walked out and I'm like, I'm going to go try that.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:57.000\nAnd then I was like, hey, like, like someone was like,\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\ncan I borrow a dollar?\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:02.000\nAnd I was like, you'd like a dollar.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nAnd then I stopped trying it because the guy was like,\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:05.000\nThat's what you're supposed to do.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:06.000\nJust repeat what they say.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:09.000\nWell, you're supposed to, you're supposed to reflect who they are.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:10.000\nOkay, let's try it.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nBut you, but you have to put your shirt on like,\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:13.000\nlike other way.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:14.000\nShould we try it?\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nNo, the people, people are interested in themselves.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nEveryone's been, you know, they come to you.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:20.000\nNot me.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:23.000\nYou're very contrarian.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:24.000\nThat's great about you.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:25.000\nYou're interesting.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nYou're interesting.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:31.000\nI love, I love, it's amazing how you interrupt.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nI love your phone and your glasses.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:34.000\nTell them you're lucky.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:35.000\nTell them you're lucky.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:40.000\nYou're, I saw Kate getting the mail the other day.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nYou're a lucky guy.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nYeah.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:45.000\nWhat?\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:48.000\nYou've got a lot of mail.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:58.000\nHey, Dan, my hair is very important to me.\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:02.000\nSounds like it.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nTell me more.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:05.000\nAbout your hair.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:08.000\nThere's got to be, there's got to be more to it than that.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:09.000\nJust repeating.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:12.000\nShe wasn't like telling me, don't, don't throw, I was just saying, like, I just,\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:13.000\nit was right at the end of the session.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nShe's like, you know, do that thing where you're a mirror.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nAnd I was like, wait, a mirror?\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:21.000\nYou mean like four agreements, how we're all mirrors and smoke and light?\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\nShe's like, what the fuck?\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:27.000\nNo.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nCan't authorize you reading that poison.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:30.000\nI'm a fucking therapist.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.000\nNo, she likes it.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:32.000\nI told her I read it.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:35.000\nShe's like, that's fine.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:38.000\nAs long as the fifth agreement is you keep coming to me.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:42.000\nI was like, no, the fifth agreement is that he had his son write a book.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nOkay.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nShe's like, I heard you talk about that episode 300.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:46.000\nOkay.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:47.000\nI was like, you listen to the show?\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nShe's like, yeah, I'm like, all right, well, let's, I'll keep coming to you.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nShe's like, you're not going to get better.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nI'm like, okay.\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nShe's never listened to the show.\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nWhere was I?\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:58.000\nMirror.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nOh, she just said, be a mirror.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:04.000\nAnd she's like, yeah, you know, people want to, when they, when they come, when someone\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:09.000\nputs out an emotional bid, for instance, if you're in a couple, like, like, is somebody\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:13.000\nsaying, look at that thing over there, or I did this thing today or whatever.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:19.000\nThey're not saying necessarily, they don't have the time to say, or they're like, I,\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:22.000\nI have something to say.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:26.000\nAnd I've thought it through, and it's the most important thing in the world.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:30.000\nAnd it's so worthy of your attention, and it says so much about me.\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:34.000\nAnd also, you know, it's just, it's a lot of times it's just, we're just like little,\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:38.000\nyou know, animals, we're just like touching each other verbally, of course, we just,\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:44.000\nit's, so I have this problem, like small talk, like I can't, you know, and it's like a lot\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:47.000\nof, I'm sure a lot of my audience has small talk problems.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:51.000\nYou know, whether you have ADD or Asperger's, that's really the two groups in my audience.\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:55.000\nBut, but both have a problem with small talk, because it's like, kind of like, I don't know,\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:58.000\nit engages the logical part of your brain, and you're like, well, what do you, what do you mean?\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nWhy don't you tell, like, I don't know what you're telling me, man.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nBut, but it doesn't, it's not that simple either.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nIt's not like we're Spock, and we want people to just make sense.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:08.000\nIt's like, it's just, also it's like, some people say shit just because they want to,\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:09.000\nthey want to talk.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:10.000\nI don't fucking know yet.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:14.000\nBut, but like, I always thought it was like, we all have energy.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:17.000\nLike, I have a bucket of energy when I wake up, you have a bucket of energy.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:20.000\nSome people have a hole in the bottom of their bucket of energy.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nThey're called executives.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:25.000\nI had to riff a thing, I don't know.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:28.000\nBut, but, but like, some people, you know, you've met those people, they're just like,\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:29.000\nhey, what about me?\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:32.000\nAnd you're like, oh, you, and you pour some in, and because the hole's not that big,\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:35.000\nit kind of fills up a little bit, and then you're like, wait, it's Wednesday.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nDidn't you say, hey, what about me on Tuesday?\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nBut, and you slowly learn over time that they're a vampire.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:43.000\nLike, they're going to suck all of your juice into their bucket, and theirs has no bottom.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:46.000\nYours does, but yours doesn't fill that fast, because you have dignity.\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:50.000\nBut, but it's not necessarily like that.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:53.000\nYou have, you could just, people can just radiate things.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nLike, I radiate shame.\n\n38:55.000 --> 39:00.000\nI have so much shame that if everyone lets me, the fucking buckets would overflow with it.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nLike, no one was a deal with my shame.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\nLike, I love it.\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:08.000\nI'm just, it certainly fills a show out after we run out of shit.\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:10.000\nUnited leggings forever 12, that's it.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nI don't know why I keep looking at this.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:18.000\nBut, but like, I think, you know, there are people who are good at that thing that we tease therapists for\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:21.000\nand they, they listen and then they repeat what you said back to you.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:26.000\nLike, what I'm hearing is this and that, but like, you can do that emotionally.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:31.000\nYou don't even have to really actually say the words.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:36.000\nIt's just that you could perceive yourself as a mirror, and it's about them.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:38.000\nIt's not about you.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:44.000\nIt's like your job in the conversation is for them to have some time to work some shit out.\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:48.000\nAnd that can actually be good for them.\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:49.000\nAnd you're a mirror.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:54.000\nSo you're, you're a passive role, but you're like actively like helping them.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:57.000\nYeah, it's called listening or a first date.\n\n39:57.000 --> 40:00.000\nIt's called the first date because on your first date, you're like, what?\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nYes, more.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:03.000\nYou're chill.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nWhat your dad?\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nHe was a what underwater.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:10.000\nOh man.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:14.000\nBut, but as we get familiar with people, we're like, God damn underwater.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nI heard the first time Jesus Christ.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:22.000\nBut truthfully, you'd always be super satisfied if you stayed interested in the shit that was around you.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:23.000\nYeah, because nobody, yeah.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:27.000\nI mean, it's being a mirror is not just like, like listening.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:33.000\nIt's like saying like, not like, you can just reflect what they're saying back at them because that's why they're talking.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:34.000\nRight.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nYeah, I think it's, I think it's like, yeah, it's like key.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:42.000\nLike you don't have to just mockingly repeat back or make a photocopy or, but, but like it's just listening.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:47.000\nI guess I had to think of it as a mirror because otherwise I was thinking of it as like an exchange.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nLike, oh, I'm giving you energy.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:50.000\nWhen do I get it back?\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:51.000\nI'm giving you time.\n\n40:51.000 -->

I'm getting fucked out of Minecraft time.\n\n40:58.000 --> 40:59.000\nAll right.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:03.000\nWell, but, but if you're a mirror, okay, it doesn't apply to time.\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:04.000\nYou're still fucking me out of time.\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:05.000\nI could be playing Minecraft.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:10.000\nDo you feel fucked out of Minecraft time right now because we're doing a harming?\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:13.000\nI mean, there's some things I'd like to try at my base.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:14.000\nNo, I don't know.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:15.000\nI'm fine here.\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:16.000\nIt's fine.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\nYou know, what do we got another hour to kill?\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:19.000\nShady ass answer.\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:24.000\nIt's fine.\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:25.000\nNo, no, it's fine.\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:26.000\nHow was your one-man show?\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:27.000\nThe answer was yes.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:28.000\nIt's fine.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:29.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:32.000\nNo, no, I'm not going to, I know I'm not going to be all the way happy when I'm playing Minecraft\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:34.000\ntonight as soon as I get home.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nI'm not going to immediately become blissful.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:40.000\nI'm like, I'm, if I didn't have this, I'd be unhappy over time.\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:46.000\nDo you, do you play Minecraft with Jeremy Irons?\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nAnd what is that like?\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:49.000\nYeah.\n\n41:49.000 -->

42:08.000\nPatrick Stewart.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nCan you send Jeremy Irons in?\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:13.000\nSo I basically want a second chance.\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:14.000\nYes.\n\n42:14.000 -->

57:38.000\nYeah, not my birthday.\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:42.000\nDid you find people living in my house?\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:44.000\nOh, you met the goose.\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:47.000\nThat motherfucker

time.\n\n57:57.000 --> 58:01.000\nI want to let you know that beanstalk is something that really means a lot to me.\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:02.000\nSo I hope you enjoy it.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:03.000\nIt's a rip-off.\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:04.000\nYou took my money.\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:07.000\nI should come down that vine and crush you.\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nHey, man, it's Trump's America.\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nWe all just trying to survive, all right?\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:16.000\nNow, I used to sell mobile homes before this, and I thought you'd be happy with that beanstalk.\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:17.000\nIt's nice.\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:18.000\nIt's uphill.\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:22.000\nNot a lot of people up there, and that goose lays golden eggs, and they're delicious.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:27.000\nI guess my only goal was to come up here and die.\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:32.000\nYou might want to learn about other people, maybe talk to the people around you.\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:39.000\nI wanted to be a fish out of water story where it was thrust upon me like northern exposure.\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nOr many sitcoms.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:45.000\nWe all want to be left alone until we're dying.\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nThat's just how life works.\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:50.000\nAll right, I'm not through with you, but goodbye.\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:52.000\nHey, tell that goose I said hello.\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:53.000\nClick.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nHey, I'm back.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:56.000\nHey.\n\n58:56.000 -->

can't fly, can you?\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nNo.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nYou know, I didn't think I could shit a golden egg either, to be honest.\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nAnd I just did, so...\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nYeah.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nOkay.\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nI'll fly you there.\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nMan, Amber alert.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nA man presenting himself as golden goose.\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nNot really a goose.\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nDon't, don't, don't look at that.\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nDon't look at that.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nHe just paints his poop gold.\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nDon't, don't, don't.\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nIf you, if you are currently holding what you think is a golden egg, you're probably\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nholding golden poop.\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nAsk the goose if he can fly.\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nDon't ask him.\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nThat's fake.\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nIt's fake.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nIt's fake, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, just let's go.\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nYAAAHHH!\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nSMASH!\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nHe's dead.\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nMy name is Giant Iced Tea, here to say I'm going to call an Uber in the usual way.\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nBip, beep, boop, boop, V5o.\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nUber shows up and away I go.\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nDriving across the clouds.\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nGuys playing Armenian music pretty loud.\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nI can smell his cologne, but I'm gonna see my father won't die alone.\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nBut I'm here with you too.\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nOh shit, Tiny Iced Tea.\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nYo.\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nIt's fucked up, man.\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nIt's not personal, it's business.\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nHello.\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nHello.\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nGiant Iced Tea?\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nYes.\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nThis is your mother again.\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nI feel like you should know something.\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nYour father, your biological father?\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nIt's Tiny Iced Tea.\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nListen, man, there was never gonna be a good time to say it.\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nStop the car, stop the Uber, stop it.\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nAre you sure you want the, I think I know better.\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nNo you don't, just stop the car.\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nOkay, well you're not women, so I'll do what you want.\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nYeah, I wrote it.\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nWhere are you going, son?\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nPlease, these are clouds, you could walk forever.\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nShut up, leave me alone.\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nI'm walking behind you as you're marching forward the cameras in front of you and tracking.\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nIt's one of those shots.\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nStop describing it.\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nYou act like that's something I do all the time.\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nNo, just shut up, I hate you.\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nI can't say I love you.\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nI'm stopping.\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nBecause I don't know you.\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nBut I want to get to know you.\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nIf you want to know me, here's what you gotta do.\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nI'm gonna fuck your mama with my left and right shoe.\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nThat's a start.\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nI fuck her with a fart.\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nI fuck her with a long dart.\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nI fuck her.\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nDance.\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nOh, we're dancing.\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nWe're dancing the same way.\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nThe camera's zooming in on me to see the moves that I share with you.\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nAnd then I take the moves and I do them when the camera pulls back.\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nBecause we're very different sizes.\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nI'm trying iced tea.\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nI'm trying iced tea.\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nI'm trying iced tea.\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nI'm trying iced tea.\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nI'm trying iced tea.\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nI'm trying iced tea.\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nTwo iced teas in the place to be.\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000\nIn a cloud world, fuck your mama so hot she turned into a girl.\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nFucking epic battle of tiny iced tea.\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nAnd giant iced tea.\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nIt was lower case and capital T.\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nIt was amazing.\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nSo many teas.\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000\nSo good.\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000\nI mean, it went to a dark place.\n\n01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nIt went to a dark place.\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000\nIt went to, like, then you don't have the face of somebody that you felt that was wrong.\n\n01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nYeah, I didn't like it.\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000\nI don't like it.\n\n01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nI thought it was kind of meandering.\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nThere's a lot of confusing breakdowns.\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nIt takes a little while to get to that darkness.\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000\nBut once we got there, it was dark.\n\n01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nWhat did we really learn?\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nYou know what was good was that Ed 209 thing.\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000\nThat's what people are remembering.\n\n01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nThey're like, that was kind of like that.\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nBut it wasn't as good, right?\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nNo, it was great.\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nWe'll find out tomorrow.\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nI just wanted to know what happened to him.\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nI mean, I guess they're reunited with his father.\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nAnd what else do you do?\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000\nClosure.\n\n01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nWrong song.\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nYou have to look of, like, it's not completed.\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nYeah, I feel like, like, what hat?\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nWhat's the point?\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nYou're back with your father.\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000\nWho cares?\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nI think, like, you found out that your father is, like, you're at the bottom of the circle right now.\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nNow you've got to find out, like...\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nYeah, but I wouldn't want to continue.\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nI just felt like a clunky property.\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nClearly, they move in together.\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nYeah, but on a cloud, and it's just clunky.\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nIt's like, like, the goose lives there, and it's like, I couldn't tell what's going on.\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000\nNo, but you killed the goose.\n\n01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nThe goose got killed, right?\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nYeah, the goose got killed.\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nI stomped on him because I got confused.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nI just wanted to move on.\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nI was, like, I was panicking.\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nI was, like, narratively panicking.\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nI feel like you didn't make enough use out of those gifts you were given, those avocados and climatos.\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nI feel like that's an opportunity that's, like, in a video game.\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nYou go, oh, shit, I combined the avocados and the climatos.\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nLike, just to get the taste out of my mouth, just do a standard five-minute, just, like,\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nand cap, just do a little story, okay?\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nBut it doesn't have to have music.\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nIt's not a rap.\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nJust, like, tell a story from beginning to end.\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nStarting from where we left off?\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nNo, no, totally different thing.\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nJust to clear my palate.\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nBecause it was just, like...\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nAll right.\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nI think you were afraid of where you were getting.\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nYou're worried that you were getting somewhere too emotionally raw.\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nAre you saying he's having, like, a giant flashback?\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nYou're saying you want to pick up now, you want to do, like, it's years later,\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nand giant iced tea and tiny iced tea are living together.\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nYou pick.\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nI'll leave it to you.\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000\nAll right.\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nWell, let's do that, because then...\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000\nOkay, so we'll just wrap it up.\n\n01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nSo this is, like, the after the credits.\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nYou want to beat?\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nNo.\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nNo.\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nThis is after the credits.\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:10.000\nIn the news today, there's a thing, a flap on it, it's going around, it's going around.\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nThis is just a downbeat.\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nThere's nothing, the news is just happening,\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nbecause otherwise there'd be a scene with someone staring into space.\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nThat would be weird.\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nIt's not foreshadowing.\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nI'm not talking about something important.\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nI'm not saying there's a meteor with strange contents.\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nI'm just saying there was a thing flapping around.\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nThe Dow Jones, there, that's innocuous.\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nThe Dow, in the news today...\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nAll right, doing it again.\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nIn the news today, the Dow Jones was on a...\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000\nOkay, you won't mistake that for pipe.\n\n01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nOkay.\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nOh, I love the Dow Jones.\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nSon, can I talk to you?\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nShit.\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nPersonal business.\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nI have cancer.\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nSo do I.\n\n01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nWhat if we combine them?\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nWhat kind do you have?\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nWhy does that matter?\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000\nBecause I'm not going to combine random cancers.\n\n01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nFuck, are you a doctor, motherfucker?\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000\nI don't have to be a doctor to not want to mix fucking just random...\n\n01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000\nMotherfucker, we're doing...\n\n01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nFuck you.\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000\nFuck you!\n\n01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000\nI don't even have cancer.\n\n01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nMe neither, bitch!\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000\nI have, for real, I have cancer.\n\n01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000\nMe too.\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nWhat kind?\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000\nTesticular.\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nProstate.\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000\nI don't really have cancer.\n\n01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000\nFuck, fuck!\n\n01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nNow you're going to lose your testicles.\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nYou piece of shit.\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000\nAfter everything I've done,\n\n01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000\nbrought you into this world.\n\n01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000\nYeah.\n\n01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nSo?\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000\nNow you...\n\n01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000\nSo what?\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nYou don't give a fuck if I live or die, do you?\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nMaybe it's not that.\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nMaybe it's that I don't know what to do with my emotions\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000\nbecause you didn't raise me right.\n\n01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000\nSo you don't want to tell me.\n\n01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nYou tell me.\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nYou can't even talk.\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nCan you give me a ride to the hospital,\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nmotherfucker,\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nto get my fucking cancery testicle cut off,\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000\nmotherfucker?\n\n01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nCan you do me that?\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nAll right, all right.\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nJesus fucking Christ, like I asked for the fucking world.\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nI want to get one nut cut off, motherfucker.\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nAll right.\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nMy car's dirty.\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000\nYou don't think I know where it is?\n\n01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000\nI got a McDonald's bag, motherfucker.\n\n01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000\nAll right, get in.\n\n01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000\nLife's a fruit, bro.\n\n01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000\nWe both are.\n\n01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nHey!\n\n01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000\nWelcome to the hospital.\n\n01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nI know you.\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000\nI drive an Uber during the day.\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nWelcome to the hospital.\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000\nI make a five stars.\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nMy father has testicular cancer.\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nHe needs one of his testicles removed.\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:34.000\nWell, I'm afraid there's no more health care.\n\n01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.000\nWe both voted for Trump.\n\n01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nI'm glad to be in the same page as my son.\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000\nWe are both hardcore laborers.\n\n01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:58.000\nWe backed the president that would give us less black health care.\n\n01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nWell, you made a mistake.\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nLet me guess.\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000\nYou didn't like it because it said Obama in front of it?\n\n01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nYeah, you don't have to pigeonhole us.\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nPsych!\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000\nThat was your health care.\n\n01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nIt was called Obamacare by Racist\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nthat wanted you to associate it with the black president.\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nNow you have to keep your cancer testicle.\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nHold on a second.\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nHere's the news.\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nObama's health care is still on.\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000\nYou can lose your testicle.\n\n01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nYay!\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000\nI love Obama.\n\n01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nI found out that racism doesn't really get you anywhere.\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nPolitically speaking, it doesn't.\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nPeople who gravitate towards politics are typically conniving.\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nAverage intelligent people have 100 IQs.\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nThey're not like geniuses.\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nThey work on Wall Street or be physicists.\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nI guess our country was an experiment that lasted as long as it could before collapsing.\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nI wouldn't go that far.\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nJesus Christ, this is a whole emergency room for the young people out there\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nthat would like to hear something different.\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000\nWe're not listening to me. You might not be removed.\n\n01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nDad, I'll give a fuck what they say.\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000\nFuck I love you.\n\n01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:38.000\nJust hold on. One more snip.\n\n01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000\nNow this last one is very crucial.\n\n01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nYou have a 70% chance of survival if you, if when I snip it, snip it.\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nYou have a bond with your son.\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nIt's a freak thing about testosterone and the paternal biological axis.\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000\nApparently the incidence of testosterone...\n\n01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000\nSorry, hold on a second.\n\n01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nMaggie, give me that thing.\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nHere it is, Dr. Shit.\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nTesticular cancer.\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nThey started to rise as the government co-opted the father-son bond\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nand infantilized the entire American family and made everyone go to work\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000\nand raised everyone like they were children, eating Twinkies and watching TV\n\n01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000\nand thinking that fame would end all their problems when actually we're just an Orwellian future\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nbut because we're not wearing coveralls it doesn't appear Orwellian.\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nWe're wearing like fucking t-shirts from shows we like.\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nBut that has resulted in a lower sperm count across the American index\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000\nand also it's also everyone's testicles are rotting away\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nbecause fathers and sons don't get along with each other anymore.\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:00.000\nSo the point is, when I researched, if you just hold your son's hand and truly love him\n\n01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.000\nyou may survive this testicularctomy.\n\n01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000\nWell, it's worth a shot.\n\n01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nAll right.\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nHand-hold sound effect.\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nSmorch.\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000\nCarry on my wayward song.\n\n01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000\nWe'll be pleased without you.\n\n01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000\nSon, I got you a kite.\n\n01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nThank you.\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000\nCan you help me the damn long, damn long way out?\n\n01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000\nSon, I got you a bicycle.\n\n01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000\nThank you.\n\n01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000\nDon't you cry no more.\n\n01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nSnip.\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.660\nTed, no, I love the bike!\n\n01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:59.660\nDaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\n\n01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.380\nOnce I caught into a land of the future\n\n01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:07.340\nI went into a cornfield and a suture\n\n01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:10.840\nAnd if I say that I'm a blind man\n\n01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.740\nIt surely means that I can't see\n\n01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:17.740\nI put my hat into a sock and a doughnut\n\n01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:21.740\nI got into a car and I couldn't start up\n\n01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:24.740\nI try to drive home from the hospital\n\n01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:28.740\nCause my dad just died\n\n01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:32.740\nCarry on my way home, sir\n\n01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:35.740\nHelp me peace when you wander\n\n01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:44.740\nGoddamn!\n\n01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:47.740\nI just saw you crying, giant\n\n01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:49.740\nI couldn't believe it\n\n01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:51.740\nYeah, well, whatever\n\n01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:56.740\nYou look like somebody who just lost their father in a testicular accident\n\n01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:59.740\nYeah, sure, whatever\n\n01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:02.740\nDid you get a chance to say goodbye?\n\n01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.740\nI was there with him till a bitter end\n\n01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:08.740\nHeld his hand, felt his soul slip away\n\n01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:12.740\nWow, it's pretty deep\n\n01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:19.740\nYou think you'll be alright?\n\n01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:22.740\nOr do I have to sit here and mirror you\n\n01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:30.740\nWhen I could be playing a video game?\n\n01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:32.740\nGet in!\n\n01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.740\nAlright, here we go\n\n01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:37.740\nCarry on my way home\n\n01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:40.740\nAlright, that's an ending\n\n01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:43.740\nFucking good\n\n01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:49.740\nAlright, yeah\n\n01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.740\nMaybe that wasn't an after the credits\n\n01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.740\nI mean, that was the rest of the movie\n\n01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.740\nIf it had ended up, I'd be like, that was good\n\n01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:57.740\nBut I couldn't have gone that long\n\n01:22:57.740 --> 01:22:59.740\nIt would be like Barry Linden, you know\n\n01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:02.740\nIt would be an intermission in the middle\n\n01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:05.740\nYou like that Barry Linden movie?\n\n01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:06.740\nI haven't seen it\n\n01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:08.740\nWell, it drags a little bit\n\n01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:11.740\nThey had a special film made for Stanley Kubrick\n\n01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:13.740\nBecause he...\n\n01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.740\nSpecial lights\n\n01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:17.740\nHe didn't want to light it\n\n01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:20.740\nNo, it was a special film too, special film stock\n\n01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.740\nDon't shake it, no, I saw it on the Goddamn Tivo description\n\n01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:25.740\nOr whatever you call it\n\n01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.740\nIt's a film, film stock\n\n01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:29.740\nYeah, y'all better get y'all Googles out\n\n01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:31.740\nEverybody get their Googles out\n\n01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:34.740\nIt was specifically like NASA\n\n01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:36.740\nI don't doubt that lenses were involved\n\n01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:37.740\nFor sure they would be\n\n01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:40.740\nBut I also truly believe that I saw a film stock\n\n01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:42.740\nLike that he had special film made\n\n01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.740\nOh, that's probably...\n\n01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:44.740\nYeah, we'll tell him\n\n01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.740\nI think the crafty was different\n\n01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.740\nThe lens was stuck right there\n\n01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:49.740\nIt kept the image\n\n01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:51.740\nRight\n\n01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:53.740\nRight\n\n01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:56.740\nThe lens was made for the politicians\n\n01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:57.740\nThat's what he just said\n\n01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:58.740\nYou guys are obsessed with the lens\n\n01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.740\nI'm not taking the lens away from you\n\n01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.740\nYou guys are telling me\n\n01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.740\nAll kinds of interesting stuff\n\n01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:13.740\nBut what happened was\n\n01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:15.740\nI was called a liar for saying film stock\n\n01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.740\nI'm telling you\n\n01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:18.740\nHe had special film stock made\n\n01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.740\nI'm sure it had to be like special...\n\n01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:21.740\nI'm pretty sure it was lens\n\n01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.740\nGoddamn it, it's not a dichotomy\n\n01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:27.740\nYou can't give me film stock?\n\n01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:29.740\nIt's not a...\n\n01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:31.740\nWhy does it have to be either or?\n\n01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.740\nYou can't accept a world where it might...\n\n01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.740\nLet's go\n\n01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:39.740\nSo what film stock did he shoot Barry Lyndon on?\n\n01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:41.740\nYou told me!\n\n01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:45.740\nThe burden of proof is on me\n\n01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.740\nBecause I'm asserting that something was weird\n\n01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:48.740\nThat's the rule\n\n01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.740\nSorry, what?\n\n01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:52.740\n15mm film stock\n\n01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:55.740\nAlright, young Tommy Chong clone\n\n01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.740\nSo does that mean different film stock?\n\n01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:04.740\nBut 15mm, that sounds made up\n\n01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:10.740\nThat's what...\n\n01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.740\nAnd so I was right\n\n01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.740\nBecause I never said they were wrong\n\n01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.740\nAnd their fucking millennial caught up and said\n\n01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:18.740\nNo, you're viewed, Paul Ryan\n\n01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:20.740\nNo!\n\n01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:22.740\nWe can all be naked!\n\n01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.740\nI knew...\n\n01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:28.740\nIt's not like I would see...\n\n01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:30.740\nI don't know anything about shooting stuff\n\n01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:32.740\nSo I read the description of Barry Lyndon\n\n01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.740\nFor me to perceive the words film stock\n\n01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.740\nI wouldn't have then supplanted it\n\n01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:38.740\nIf it said lens\n\n01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.740\nI would have said lens\n\n01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.740\nI'm not that gone yet\n\n01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:44.740\nI saw it on the besides lens\n\n01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:46.740\nWhich they got from that lens\n\n01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:48.740\nI gave you your lens\n\n01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.740\nThis is why you need bullies\n\n01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.740\nThis is why bullying wasn't mentioned\n\n01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:58.740\nBecause two nerds will fight indefinitely\n\n01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.740\nUntil a bully comes along\n\n01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.740\nShut up, nerds!\n\n01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:08.740\nY'all nerds need to quit this shit\n\n01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.740\nHelp me with my homework\n\n01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.740\nThis could be the worst podcast ever\n\n01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.740\nIf we were just allowed to\n\n01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:16.740\nBut we could hang out and talk about lenses all night\n\n01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.740\nI want to know though, what was it, Heather Hooks?\n\n01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.740\nIt's both?\n\n01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:22.740\nOf course it's both\n\n01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:24.740\nOf course you wouldn't change the lens\n\n01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.740\nAnd then keep the...\n\n01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.740\nNo, I need that Pan Am Rama film stock\n\n01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.740\nBut I just need to change the lens\n\n01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.740\nThat's crazy\n\n01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:34.740\nHe can't give up\n\n01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:36.740\nHe can't give up!\n\n01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.740\nYou can't give up\n\n01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.740\nWith the film stock doesn't matter\n\n01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:42.740\nWhy would you say that, though?\n\n01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:44.740\nWhy wouldn't the film stock matter?\n\n01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:46.740\nOf course the film stock matters\n\n01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.740\nYou're wrong, bro\n\n01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.740\nI can tell by the look on your face\n\n01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:52.740\nYou're wrong, because you're not committed to your disness\n\n01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.740\nNo, he's just so into lens\n\n01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:56.740\nHe works for NASA\n\n01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:58.740\nHe works for NASA\n\n01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.740\nBut do he make the film for NASA?\n\n01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.740\nFilm stock!\n\n01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.740\nBut nobody makes the film anymore\n\n01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:06.740\nBecause it was special film!\n\n01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:08.740\nYeah!\n\n01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:10.740\nSpecial film stock!\n\n01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.740\nDan, Dave Kline just handed me his phone\n\n01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:14.740\nKubrick was determined not to reproduce\n\n01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:16.740\nthe set bound artificially look\n\n01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.740\nof other costume dramas from that time\n\n01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:20.740\nAfter tinkering with different combinations\n\n01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:22.740\nof lenses and film stock\n\n01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.740\nThe production obtained three super fast\n\n01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.740\n50 millimeter lenses\n\n01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:28.740\nDeveloped by Zeiss\n\n01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:30.740\nSo he experimented\n\n01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.740\nwith film stock\n\n01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.740\nand it turned out to not work\n\n01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.740\nIt's a different type of film stock, too\n\n01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.740\nWell, that sounded like\n\n01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:40.740\nYou're both right!\n\n01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:42.740\nI'm willing to say I'm wrong\n\n01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.740\nThese lenses were first developed\n\n01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.740\nby a website called Legs Lab-ish\n\n01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:58.740\nWe should all go online and check it out\n\n01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.740\nI was wondering\n\n01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.740\nDid you\n\n01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:04.740\nI think probably everyone here\n\n01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:06.740\nsaw maybe that clip\n\n01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.740\nof Ted Koppel talking to Sean Hannity\n\n01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.740\nIs that his name?\n\n01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:12.740\nI think you are bad\n\n01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.740\nBut you think we're bad\n\n01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.740\nYou think we're bad?\n\n01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.740\nLet me talk!\n\n01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.740\nI ought to punch you in your\n\n01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.740\nyoung face\n\n01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.740\nAnd it was he did\n\n01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.740\nTed Koppel's baller because he's the only person\n\n01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:28.740\nup to that motherfucker on his show\n\n01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:30.740\nWell the 70s are baller now\n\n01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.740\nWoodward and Bernstein are out there\n\n01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.740\nHe doesn't know what side to part his hair on\n\n01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:36.740\nHe doesn't give a shit!\n\n01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:38.740\nBecause we're living in this world\n\n01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:40.740\nthat larger piece I was just watching in the green room\n\n01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.740\nthere was a larger thing that Ted Koppel did\n\n01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:44.740\nthat was just about the fact\n\n01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.740\nand we're tired of hearing this\n\n01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:48.740\nbecause what does it fucking mean?\n\n01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.740\nThe fact that our relationship with facts\n\n01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:52.740\nhas become\n\n01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.740\nit's now subjective\n\n01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.740\nwe all thought in the 90s\n\n01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:58.740\nwe thought there's going to be all kinds of trouble\n\n01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:00.740\nbut it's going to be because\n\n01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:02.740\ninformation is going to bleed\n\n01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:04.740\nall together\n\n01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.740\nwe all anticipated all kinds of trouble\n\n01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:08.740\ntrouble like I don't know\n\n01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:10.740\nlike kiddie porn will be easier\n\n01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:12.740\npeople will be able to get away with crime more\n\n01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:14.740\nthen the government is going to want to clamp down\n\n01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:16.740\nand thought will be a crime\n\n01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:18.740\nit was all predicated\n\n01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:20.740\nthere was all this unspoken assumption\n\n01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:22.740\nthat information had\n\n01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.740\nsome kind of inherent value\n\n01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:26.740\nit was like gold or something\n\n01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:28.740\nthe truth could be known\n\n01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.740\nand that the truth was a thing\n\n01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:32.740\nthat you could back the dollar with\n\n01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.740\nand you could back political accountability with\n\n01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.740\nbut we've been slipping\n\n01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:38.740\nfor a really long time into like\n\n01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.740\nand this is just so ironic\n\n01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.740\nthat as the technology of communication increases\n\n01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:44.740\nyou can actually, it turns out\n\n01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:46.740\nthe truth becomes\n\n01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:48.740\nlike\n\n01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:50.740\na boring thing that only when you\n\n01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:52.740\nall mist into a poison\n\n01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:54.740\nand blow it into people's eyes\n\n01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:56.740\na certain way does it make them do things\n\n01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:58.740\nlike the truth and we should have seen that\n\n01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.740\ncoming because when I was a kid\n\n01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:02.740\nyou'd watch the news and if the news anchor\n\n01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:04.740\nwas like Nicaragua you'd be like boring flip\n\n01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:06.740\nthat country\n\n01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:08.740\nhas got a weird name and I'm like\n\n01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:10.740\nthe truth is boring\n\n01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:12.740\nand that used to include things like healthcare\n\n01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.740\nand all this stuff and we're like we don't\n\n01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:16.740\nlike it's only people that mash\n\n01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.740\nit up and go like\n\n01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.740\noh boogie man\n\n01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:24.740\nthey're getting reactions and clicks\n\n01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:26.740\nand it's like I don't know what my point is\n\n01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:28.740\nI'm just shaking my cane at everything\n\n01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:30.740\nDid you see other people who showed up\n\n01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:32.740\nthat had pizza gate t-shirts\n\n01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:34.740\nthis weekend in Washington\n\n01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:36.740\nbecause they still believe that pizza gate is real\n\n01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:38.740\neven though Alex Jones has come out and said\n\n01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:40.740\nI apologize\n\n01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.740\nbecause you only need to hear\n\n01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.740\nit turns out, they told me\n\n01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:46.740\nwhen I was trying to make my dog not shit in the house\n\n01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:48.740\nand I was like\n\n01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:50.740\nby the way I didn't want to have her own a dog\n\n01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.740\nbecause I thought growing up in Milwaukee\n\n01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:54.740\nI thought in order to own a dog\n\n01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:56.740\nit meant you had to be mean to it\n\n01:30:56.740 --> 01:30:58.740\nbecause how else could you possibly train a dog\n\n01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:00.740\nto do things in turn\n\n01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:02.740\nand then I read books and all this stuff\n\n01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:04.740\nand I was like oh you'd never have to have\n\n01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:06.740\nnever, my dogs never experience any punishment\n\n01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:08.740\nit's only experience reward\n\n01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:10.740\nand it shits outside\n\n01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:12.740\nI got off on a tangent there, I'm a great dog owner\n\n01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:14.740\nI went to that breeder\n\n01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.740\nand I said give me a great dog\n\n01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.740\nsorry\n\n01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:22.740\nbut the thing that I heard\n\n01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:24.740\nfrom the people that come over and go\n\n01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:26.740\nI was like god damn it my second dog\n\n01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:28.740\nhe's hard to train\n\n01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.740\nhe's a little fucker\n\n01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:32.740\nand I started learning about dog training\n\n01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:34.740\nand she's like you can't\n\n01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.740\npeople come home, they see a turd\n\n01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:38.740\nand they think you take the dog's face\n\n01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:40.740\nand you look at the turd\n\n01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:42.740\nthat dog doesn't know what that turd is\n\n01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:44.740\nand the dogs live in the moment\n\n01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:46.740\nand she was like\n\n01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:48.740\nthey study this shit\n\n01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:50.740\nand there's a window of time\n\n01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:52.740\nduring which a
