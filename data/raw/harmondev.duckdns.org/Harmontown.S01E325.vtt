WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Yeah!

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Harmontown.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
How do you feel tonight?

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Oh, my goodness.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
So good to see you all.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Let's get right into it.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
We don't need a lot of fanfare.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Wave your hands in the air.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
His name is Dan Harbour.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
And his friend's name, King of the Game, Mr. Rob Schrupp.

00:33.000 --> 00:56.000
Flowers bloom for you, Brandon Johnson.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
In the spring and every season.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
But your mama so hard, I gave her me too.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
And the tumbleweeds, and the pollen, and the honeybees

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
are all flying around, eating cheese.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
Damn, I remember the one time.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
Damn, I remember that other time.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Damn, I remember all the times.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
I got photographic recall.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
And it's wasted on me.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
No, all time was at all.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
What?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
No, all time was at all.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Sorry, I...

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Talking about your photographic recall.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh, but what about it?

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Just saying you don't have no all time was at all.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh, I think I got that.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Feeds, you can remember shit.

02:13.000 --> 02:22.000
Time for me to turn into a squirrel.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
Damn, I'm a squirrel.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Leaping from branch to branch,

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
foreshadowing primates.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
Slowly, my eyes will move to the front of my head.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
So I can have depth perception.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
And I'll get color vision.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
So I can recognize ripe fruit.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Oh, damn.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Damn.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
My tail's going away.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
I'm climbing down from the tree.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
And I'm living in an alarmist community

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
where we groom each other and pound our chests and

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
look out for the spotted leopards.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
And if one comes, we go, ah, ah,

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
and we all climb up in a tree.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Damn.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Damn.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Damnity.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
Very good, Dan Harmon.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
You may live another day.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
So pyramid hand decrees it.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Oh, God.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Quick, while he's either blind or...

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
There's only one man who can save pyramid man.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
There's only one man who can save pyramid man.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
And that man's name is Jeff Davis.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
Oh.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Hello, everybody.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Welcome back, Jeff.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Hello.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Welcome back to me.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Welcome back to you.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
We're kind of playing with the show format here.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I didn't want Brandon to go away.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Jeff's back.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Spencer's still gone.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Thoughts and prayers.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
I will say, certainly, if he's going through anything,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
it's not affecting his work.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
I've seen four animatics of Harmon Quest.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Very good season.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Probably best season ever.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Looking forward to that.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
Maybe he's content to just focus on that.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
And I'm here.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Who needs Spencer?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Who needs anybody?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Who needs Spencer?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I've been up all night.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
So I'll probably fall asleep tonight.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
But I've been working.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
And so I'm a little out of it.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
What are you working on?

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
Screenplay that was due a million years ago.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
And just finishing it up.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Just about finished.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
This is for Aquaman 3, right?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
It's in that area.

05:38.000 --> 05:47.000
Dr. Stranger.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Who knows?

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Who's strange?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
I was thinking about Green Arrow today.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
Dr. Stranger.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Is he called Green Arrow because he's new at it?

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Green Arrow.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
Well, I'm not the best Arrow guy here.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I'm still new.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm a little...

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
You're going to need to get your uniform

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
before you start talking to management.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
You knew Green Arrow.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
It may be a different Arrow,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
but you knew Green Arrow.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Green Lantern?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I thought you were on my side.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Just because we Green don't mean we are Green.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Green Arrow and...

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Is this helping?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Green Arrow and Green Lantern,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
they were partnered up in a series of comic books

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
that were critically acclaimed.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I can't imagine why.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Maybe it was because people liked watching the Green Lantern

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
feel awkward.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
It's like, dude, you just...

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
What is your origin story?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
You played Peter Pan in high school

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
and hit your head?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
He just shoots dumb Arrows.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
That's all he does.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Perhaps my boxing glove Arrow

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
will punch this up a bit.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Perhaps my screwdriver Arrow

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
will turn things around.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Okay, none of that works.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Perhaps my exploding Arrow will blow you up.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Just use your exploding Arrow

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
every time, Green Arrow.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Don't waste your time making

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
all these Arrows.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
What do you do?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Just budget your time.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
You're not getting them back.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah, I mean, just once you...

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
You're not getting them back.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
You gotta shoot them.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
What's he gonna do?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
He's like, hey, guys, wait a second.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Before you jump into the car

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
and drive back, I gotta go pick up my fucking Arrows.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Otherwise, I'm not equipped.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I'm not a comic book guy.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Does he conjure them up

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
or does he actually fabricate them

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
for the purpose?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
He tinkers.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
He's like part tinkerer, part archer.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
He makes his Arrows

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
in a workshop.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Is anybody a Green Arrow

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
aficionado that...

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Right, so he is, right?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Is he a meta-human?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Oh, really? See, that's kind of interesting

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
because how many other non-meta-humans

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
are there?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
At least, two.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
So, does he have a Green Arrow car?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Yes.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
What is it called?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
It's like the Arrow Mobile or something.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
We had...

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
The Rick and Morty staff were kind of

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
very delicately vandalizing

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
the Green Arrow Wikipedia one season.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
They kept adding, like,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
really...

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
We're trying to see how long can the shit

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
just seep into canon

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
because you really don't know.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
The shit gets ridiculous

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
because, like, Green Arrow's been around forever.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
There was a run of Green Arrow

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
where his sidekick Speedy had a heroin addiction.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You wouldn't be able

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
to tell, like, at a glance...

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Why did Speedy have a heroin addiction?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
He would have, like, a meth addiction.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
That's meta.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
But there was this whole thing.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
We went too far at one point

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
and we got busted.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Did they come to your house and go,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
hey, you know,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
some Green Arrow fan, like,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
expunged the whole thing.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
It was slowly building.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
There was this whole thing about

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
this really meticulous grievance between

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Green Arrow and someone else.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And part of it was he thought

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
that it started

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
with the Green Arrow Mobile

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
and how he thought that this person

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
had scratched it

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
and wouldn't admit it.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And then that was, like,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
threaded into, like, different,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
like, infinite crisis

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
and whatever, and kind of, like,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
this, like, long-standing grudge

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
with this other DC character

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
that he was convinced had scratched his car.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I mean, essentially, Dan,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
you're telling me a story about something

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
that was funny once.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
It's not really gonna be funny again.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I understand.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I haven't slept in a while.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
You've been doing some

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
DC research.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
DC research.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm trying to

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
to remind him to push him together.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Okay, so Green...

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Yeah, I learned all about Red Tornado today.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
DC search.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
So Green Lantern's weakness

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
is anything made of yellow?

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Is that purple?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Well, it goes through

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
different things, like the...

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Like yield signs?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Like wood? He couldn't affect wood?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
He doesn't affect

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
mine. So if you're like...

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
So you could...

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Hello!

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
But, yeah,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
there's some stuff with the yellow.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
But it's more about, like, the yellow

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Lantern energy or something

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
like that. Green Lantern is such

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
a turn-off to me. I can't...

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I think the only... I like

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
what the LEGO

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
DC stuff does with the Green

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Lantern powers because...

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Whatever.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
You're not going to get any smells out of me.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I guess because it's kind of like

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
for kids and then it's like through

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
the LEGO filter, it sort of like makes

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
a character whose power is just to like

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
make up random shit.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Like, they kind of...

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
They contain it within these like translucent

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
green blocks and whatever.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
But just that idea of like,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
oh, I'm going to use my imagination

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
to make a green baseball glove.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Like, it's a dumb...

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Isn't it cheating?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I've never seen any of the LEGO films.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
But the whole

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
point of LEGO is that

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
it's stationary

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
blocks of shit that you stick together.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
But then they're all their mouths are moving

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
and their faces are moving and they're doing all this

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
shit that breaks the LEGO rule.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Right?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
They should be

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
little blocky stiff

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
like, you know...

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
They are in the...

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, but their faces are all fucking

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
all over the joint, like, you know...

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Well, it'd be kind of a boring movie

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
if...

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Yeah, so don't make it out of

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
LEGO. Make it out of

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
anything else.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
They should have did that.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
They would have been famous.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
They should have done that.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Play-Doh movie. You can make whatever you want

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
out of Play-Doh. How about the Play-Mobile movie

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
that's coming out?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Have you seen

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
the DC Universe's Lincoln Log

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
movie coming out? It's all made out of logs.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I'd watch that, Dan.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
That's stupid.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
All right, we're getting into

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
bad territory for me.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I remember a guy from Hot Wheels or Mattel

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
or something like that was like touring

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
the studio, the animation studio.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
They were like, yeah, if you guys can think

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
of anything to do with Hot Wheels

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
that'd be cool.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And, you know,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
it's tough because

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
you can't just put

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
a face on the front of the car

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
because

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Pixar did that. It's like

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
the toy is

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
like a car, but, you know, and there's no

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
driver. Fuck, fuck!

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
It was like watching a guy

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
realize Hot Wheels is a

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
shitty property.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
You don't... Here's

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
something. You don't have to make a movie

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
out of everything.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah, but he's got to make

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
a movie out of Hot Wheels or he's fucking fired.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Somebody's not going to go,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
okay, we just did

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
zebras. All right.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
There's a movie for everything now.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
We can close up shop

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Hollywood. There's a movie for everything.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I was just attached to the new Connect 4

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
movie.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I play blue.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh, man, you are...

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
It is so...

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Man, you're making fun of me.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
The Dalians with the Play-Doh movie.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
The Play-Doh people wanted to...

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
We made a joke of it on community.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I know, and then

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
we were talking to the Play-Doh people.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
And Paul Feig's supposed to be directing.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I was really excited about our idea.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I love you, Grumpy.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
What? I just love how Grumpy

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Paul Feig's supposed to be directing.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
We are

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
orbiting an

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
issue of mine, so let's maybe

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
change the subject or I should stop

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
thinking, because I'm going to upload

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
a little bit. Rob, will you pass over for the Play-Doh movie?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I don't want to talk about

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
any of this anymore.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
It's going to get me into trouble.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm starting to put my life back.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Keep drinking. We'll bring it back up at

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
9.30.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Thank you. So Green Arrow...

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
One fan. Just use your exploding arrows.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Green Arrow, I know

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
if you were here he would say

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
well, just use exploding arrows.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Why don't I just buy a gun?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Don't pull that threat, Green Arrow.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Like a cop? Like a police officer?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Like a higher... Green gun.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Just keep shooting and use only bullet arrows.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
How about

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
how about have

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
the bow and arrow and

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
have a gun?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Just as a stand by.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Or a taser.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Or study philosophy.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And just, you know...

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Get out of the hero game.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Just be your best you.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
And why are you wearing a fucking mask, man?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You're walking around like

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Robin Hood with the beard.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Yeah, no one cares who you are.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
They're like, oh my gosh, who's this, Carl?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Why does Aquaman have a beard?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I keep going to hotels. I'm on the road a lot.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
And there's always an Aquaman in my bedroom.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Why is this happening to me?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Rob,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
you're not wrong there because you turn the TV on

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
and what do you get?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
The first thing you fucking get, you turn your TV on.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Sexy men.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
No, you get Mario Lopez.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Hey everybody, I'm Mario Lopez.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I'm here to talk to you about movies in your hotel room.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Like Aquaman.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And they talk about Aquaman for 30 minutes.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
A beard under water doesn't seem

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
functional.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Well, work for Poseidon.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Oh, now you're going to go well.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I'm just saying

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
name a fast-moving aquatic

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
animal that has air.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
A seal, an elephant seal.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Yeah, but very little.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
They don't have a giant...

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
They have a huge mustache, like a walrus.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Yeah.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Whales have teeth that are very much like a hairbrush.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Yeah, but they're inside their mouth.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
You asked us to name an animal.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I know that there are mammals that have

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
hair under water.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
He's not a fish man, is he? I don't know.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
He's the king of Atlantis.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
He's the king of Atlantis.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
If you give him a break, you didn't want to shave.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
They don't have razors down there.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
But he does shave because he shaves the part of his hair

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
around the Van Dyke goatee kind of thing.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
He clearly is like

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
beard scaping around it.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
So he cares about

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
appearances.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
You want to know why?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Terrible acne scars.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Awful.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Terrible acne scars.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I take it back, Mario Lopez.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Oh, you mean Aquaman.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
It would be cool

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
if he was just

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
naked.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
If his gimmick, I think that would be the way to

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
after all these attempts to like

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
we got to find the angle on Aquaman because

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
obviously in the 70s it became this

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
joke.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
We fell in love with this idea that there was

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
a super friend that

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
given his roster of powers,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
obviously the other heroes

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
would probably make fun of him and

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
kind of like stuck.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
He tried to like

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
beef up Aquaman in the comic books

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
to work against that

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
or to make him like dark and depressed

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
and alienated.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
But I do think

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
the way to do it

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
would be to make him

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
naked.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Let him be Jason Momoa

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
but then just have the running thing be like

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
he doesn't know what clothes are.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
He knows what they are.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
He's not stupid but he's like I'm not wearing those.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I'll help him out with that.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Doctor Strange.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That sounds like a strange thing to do.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Do you think

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
that we're stuck with these dudes?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Hey Aquaman!

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
You know what would be strange

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
and this is what I do.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I do. I do this.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
You know what would be strange Aquaman?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I'm crossing. I can't do that, right?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Go ahead.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I won't do it.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
You better finish this.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Okay. Doctor Strange goes

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
hey take off your clothes. That's strange.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Now

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
put him over here by mine.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Okay.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I'm sorry.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Do you think that

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
because of the time period

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
that these characters were first created

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
we're stuck in those archetypes?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Do you think that if this had been

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
it's a crazy...

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Let's say we started doing DC

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Marvel even 15 years later

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
would we have built these

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
superheroes different?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
No, just cosmetically.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
To the extent that they have any kind of shelf life

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
one would hope that that was because

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
of an organic kind of thing that made us

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
we like

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
certain characters because of archetypal

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
behaviors,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
relationships with their gadgets, not the actual

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
design of the gadgets.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Tony Stark is

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
in Batman

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I think are both kind of

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
parallel in that both of them

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
people if they like them

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
what they like is the idea that you're

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
not exceptional

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
you're not gifted in any way

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
except maybe you're

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
intelligence or whatever but you're not

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
supernaturally gifted and then you use

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
your means and your

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
and your will and your grit to like

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
take a

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
place among the gods and you're even

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
bossing them around and stuff like your

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Captain Kirk or something.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
So the genre sort of pays attention to the time

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
that it's in? Yeah, I mean that stuff's

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
easy to change along the way

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
unless

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
people are like, Peter Parker's white

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
but

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
we're living in that time right now

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
we're like, Captain Marvel

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
might have been a woman

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
that's among the many

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
what I would call cosmetic things

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
that should be

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
if things like that aren't going to be

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
up for debate then retire the whole library

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
of all these characters because

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
they were all white and they were all men

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
and every once in a while

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
we would go like, Harlem Man

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
is here and it's like good for us

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I guess

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
in 1971 but just

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
acting like because

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Harlem Man exists

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
that Peter Parker can't

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
become biracial

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
in a reboot is kind of dumb

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
because it's like that's asking us

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
to like

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
that's a disservice to the entire

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Marvel library, the DC library

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
to go because

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
it's just a fact, it's just a cultural fact

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
that

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
everybody in a comic book

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
looked a certain way back then

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
which is now not a definition

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
of something that's like real life

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
because it seems like

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
say what, sorry?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
They're not all men as well

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Oh yeah, I didn't mean to imply

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Yeah, I mean

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Are you just going to shit on Catwoman?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
My mama? My mama?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Catwoman?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I mean, I

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
What's

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
happening?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Hey, do you remember me?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I'm Louise from Brisbane

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Oh, Louise from Brisbane

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
Well, there were a lot of people there, it's a whole opera house

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Is the mic picking this up at all?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Okay

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Jeff

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Yes?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
At the Sydney Opera House

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
You were giving shit to all Australians

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
You were saying, ah, people from

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
from Brisbane like this, I think you're all crazy

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
and I said

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Hey, you elected Trump

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
and it brought the whole house down

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
and you did like a 180

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
and you walked back and you came back

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Is this fucking true, Jeff?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Did you vote for Trump?

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Did you vote for Trump?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
You voted for Trump

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
What's he saying, true Jeff?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I can't believe this

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I cannot believe this, Jeff

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Are you telling me you interrupted a show

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
and started like

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
talking to people on stage

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I don't believe you

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I don't believe you

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I remember you now, because last time

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
you were sitting audience right, stage left

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
and you came down and bummed everybody out

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
from that side, now you're doing it from that side

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
so sit your ass down

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
because you were dragged the other time, too

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I do remember you now

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Are you sure she's the same one, though?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Yes, a fucking yes, exactly

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
My thought, too, was like, oh my god

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I'm having a fucking flashback

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
You don't get to just charge the stage

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
You did it last time from over here

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
at the Sydney Opera House and you came down

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
and you were shouted down by the crowd

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
There's one charge

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Oh no, there's two

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Okay, you guys got to sit down

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
For real, for real

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I don't think that's a same person

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
No, it's exactly her

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I remember her vividly now

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
You were just a voice in the darkness

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
but now I've seen you visibly

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I appreciate your thoughts

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
and it's okay to pipe in

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
You don't get to just like

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
storm the best deal like that

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Well, I don't appreciate your thoughts

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Thank you, Dan

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Because obviously if I say

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
if I'm in the middle of addressing

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
the issue of whether or not it's okay

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
for Peter Parker to be biracial

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
and the way I expressed

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
the backdrop of my point

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
is to say that everybody

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
in comic books was a white man

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
in 1930

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
helpful or accurate

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
to bother to go

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
What about Wonder Woman? No, that's not the point

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Of course I don't mean

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
everything all the time

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
absolute everything

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I'm like painting with these strokes

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
to make a point about the movement of these things

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
like

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
the idea that I forgot

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Wonder Woman while trying to move

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
toward wokeness

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
is infuriating

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I'm glad you're in period

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
No, no, no, no, no

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
God, I fucking remember this so much

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
She was standing

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
because it was a very raked theater

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
so it was very steep seating

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
and she came down over here and she did the exact same thing

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
but right there in my left eye

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
and now it's on my right eye and I say

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It was so

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
My memory of it was that it was

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
very punctuated in Australia

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
because they were much more like

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
they're probably like

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
they were just very quick to be like

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I was on stage

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
You don't have a microphone

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
You don't have a microphone

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
For real, just like

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
have security take that

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
That's the cool thing

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
because it seems as though

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
it seems like these

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
these comic books and these universes are like music

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
in that you're allowed to reinterpret them

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
if you do a good job

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
So if you do like a remix

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
of a very classic song

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
it seems like

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
people are psyched about that

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Is that the same with superhero movies?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
We can make Superman have a different trait now

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Yeah, I don't know

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
People have a shit

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
hemorrhage if you

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
fuck with Superman's

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
canonical list of abilities

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
So if you make him

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
not bulletproof

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
just because that'll be more fun

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I think that's fucked up

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
if that's what you're saying

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Did they

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
He always had heat vision

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
and he's always had the ability to blow cold

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
But in the very beginning

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I don't think he can actually just fly

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
That's sort of like how Homer Simpson

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
starts to look more like the Homer Simpson

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
we know from the Tracy Ulman

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
show

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Characters that can fly

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
often start as characters that can

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
leap tall buildings

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
than the leaping just

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
turns into flying over time

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
But I think that for my money

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
the

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
way to modernize Superman

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
is to start from the

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
is not to worry about

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
whether or not he can do this

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
or can do that, start from the point of assumption

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
that he can do everything

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
and then ask yourself in a modern context

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
what does that mean to us

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
how would we react to that person

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
and how would he react

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
to being perceived that way

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
and what would his goals be

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
because my

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
thing with Superman is

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
who cares about Kryptonite when

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
in fact he has this much more crippling

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
weakness which is that he doesn't want

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
to be a bad person

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
that's way more fucked up than Kryptonite

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
if the police tell him

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
to get down on his knees

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
and put his hands behind his head

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
he technically has to

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
unless he wants to be a criminal that day

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
he's privileged

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
in the sense that the cops probably won't say it

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
but he probably won't kill him

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
so those are fun stories

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
where it's like oh Superman

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
he's a criminal because he's questioning

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
this congressman or whatever

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
it seems to me like that's the way to go

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
do you ever read J.J. Abrams

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Superman script fly by

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
do you ever read him

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
he didn't use

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Kryptonite either what he did was

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
he said

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Superman didn't need Kryptonite because

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
he was raised

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
by humans and his mother

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
he's adopted mother and father

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
we're saying

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
don't run as fast as you can

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
don't show people how strong you really are

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
always do less than what

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
don't reach your potential because

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
if you ever do they'll take you away from us

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
or they'll dissect you

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
or you'll be a monster

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
which is growing up in the Midwest

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
yeah exactly

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
but that was very interesting

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
how do you supplement your powers

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
it was about a Superman

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
who was like I don't know

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
how fast I really can go

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I might be able to go

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
as fast as faster than anything

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
ever I might be able to lift

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
anything

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
he has no idea

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
so that I thought was very interesting

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
yeah also psychologically if you had an inborn

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
let's say you had an inborn sense of

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
morality all those dangerous concepts

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
like the idea of like

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
that came from a different species

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
and let's say somehow that species through

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
either genetic or mimetic evolution

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
had kind of like a benchmark

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
morality to them where

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
you start from

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
a baseline of like

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
yeah don't be a piece of shit

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
and then you're transplanted to

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
a savage planet

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
where you're then raised by parents

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
who are telling you yeah you're special

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
but be careful

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
don't flash those powers

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
they'll take you away so

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
you're motivated by not being taken away

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
and then on top of that you're also being reinforced

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
the whole time with this

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
you'll feel

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
you'll never be tempted unlike a sort of wish fulfillment

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
thing where you're like

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
well wait a minute

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
if I did

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
use these powers and stopped giving a shit

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
what everyone else thinks

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I could be rich

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
or I could be successful

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
but then there's a loop there possibly

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
with Superman where he doesn't want

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
to be rich

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
or a rock star or successful

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
he only wants the one thing

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
which is actually quite difficult for him to achieve

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
which is a sense of belonging

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
he doesn't because he knows he's essentially

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
deformed

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
he's like he can't if he's not

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
careful he could karate chop your head off

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
while he's like passing the

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
salt

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
and so he's like embarrassed

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
about that is even though we would go

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
there's nothing to be embarrassed about because

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
you should just use that to either rob banks

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
or stop people from robbing banks

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
see I would love to see that as him at high school

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
and he says can you

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
can you eat those Doritos and accidentally knock

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
somebody's heads off and then

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
then he just like moves away

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I guess I gotta go to a different

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
high school again

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
because I can't explain what's going on

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I'm just like hey how you doing

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
yes I'm the new

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
student Schmarch-Ment

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Schmarch-Ment

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Schmarch-Ment

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
is this helping?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I like that his powers make him a loser

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
not super

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
it's kind of an interesting take

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
he's the opposite of Kung Fu

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
he just kills people by accident

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
by accident and has to leave town

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
every episode

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
it's always like

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
there's always some kind of thing that he takes care of

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
you know and then he's like

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
you know it's great a handshake

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
oh Jesus oh okay

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
gotta move again

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
gotta go

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
did you get your results of that Briggs Meyer test

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
did you get your results

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
he's a mediator

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
yeah you were there when I did it

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
well I forgot your results okay

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
I don't think that was a fair test

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I thought you answered the questions very

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
accurately but I didn't think

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
that the results kind of

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
encapsulated you

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
it felt like I was affected by everybody at the table

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
you know

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I was sitting there very passively

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I know I know but I'm just my own

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
you mean everybody else

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I meant everybody but you

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
where were you guys

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
when you conducted the test

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Beelman's bar

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
and Dan you want to explain

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
what we're talking about to everybody else

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
in the room

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
is it Briggs Meyer or Meyer's Briggs

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
I think all the kids know about it now

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I think they kind of like

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
some people

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
they'll put their

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
signifiers

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
on their dating profile

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
which

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I thought about that and I was like

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
yeah I thought I went through

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
a cycle I was like well I would love to know

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
yours

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
before a blind date with you because

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
not to like

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
stack the deck but to actually

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
just be like

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
you know

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
you could actually

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
the equivalent of like

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
a failed first date could be

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
actually created by

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
reading for 20 minutes like

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
kind of like oh this is a different personality

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
this person actually blah blah blah

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
and that maybe then

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
but if you were and if you were down with that

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
then you could show up to the first date

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
more prepared to have it not be

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
a disaster because you'd be like

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
well I already know that this person

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
is such a thing as a person in the world

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
that believe it or not isn't that interested

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
in this or that or whatever

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
but then I thought about it more and I was like

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I don't think I want

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I think there's too many dishonest people in the world

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
so like

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
who wants

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I think what's most valuable is maybe

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
doing your own thing and knowing who you are

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
but then putting it out on a satellite

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
dish for other people

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
it's like

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
it's just like

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
it

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
also there's like crazy people that would like

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
take the test and they'd go

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I'm a thing of a bob

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
and then they'd be so into it that

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
they would like fuck those people

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Dan did you

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
you took the test?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
what was the result?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I am an I and

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
wait

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
we did yours and you're the buttmaster

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
oh yeah yeah

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
that's it

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
you're the buttmaster

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I'm a logician

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I think it's like I

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
N

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
TP

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
what is that

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
introvert

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
narcissists

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
poopy pants

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
toilet paper

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
you're an introverted narcissistic toilet paper

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I will say

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
for my money

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
because I remember

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
when I

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I remember getting a link to take it years ago

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I remember taking it

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
and I remember getting same thing

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
same result, the logician

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
and I looked at it a little bit and I was busy at the time

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
and I was like it sounds like me but whatever

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
so the horoscopes went by

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
and then Cody sent me a link

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
a couple weeks ago

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
and I did it again

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
and that's why I remember because I was like this sounds familiar

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I got the same thing

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
and then on top of that when she told me what hers was

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
she was like oh wait a minute

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
this is like horoscopes because I also remember

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
the campaigner

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
why do I remember that so vividly

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
but it turns out the reason I do is because

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
she also took it years ago

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
and got that same result

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
so both Cody and I have taken it twice

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
several years apart

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
and gotten the same personality category

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
what does yours mean

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
what is it?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
logician

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
logical

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I'm going to leave a rabbit

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
in my hat

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
we might get her out of this water

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
or we'll just come back

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
and see if she swims

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I'm going to saw a lady one-third

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
the way through

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
pick a card

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
tell me what card it is

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
oh look you're a magician

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
it's very accurate

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I can't remember most of it

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
I just remember going wow that's me

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
so you're logical

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
that's it

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
you know that's not that simple

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
it's more like

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
a value placed on

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
the idea of logic

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
which can

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
make for a very emotional person

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
you know

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
it's very accurate

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
it's very accurate

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
it can make for a very emotional person

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I think

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
logicians are actually given to tantrums

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
a little bit more because they don't know how to handle

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
their actual feelings

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
because they

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
actually do believe

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and practice

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
the idea that there is such a thing as truth

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
and that truth is more important

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
than

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
everything else

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
but also like very

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I was happy to see

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
I've always felt that way about myself

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
that

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
in spite of this very meritocracy

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
kind of mind

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
which now we've come to associate

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
with the sort of creepy archetype

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
online

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
you just don't even want to hear that word right now

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
but

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
within that

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
the idea of being truly open

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
to

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
you don't care about hierarchy

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
you really would prefer

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
things to be on a flat plane

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
and

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
so that you could just be

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
extraordinary at your own thing

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
and everybody else could too

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
that the truth

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
would out and everybody would

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
improve themselves and stuff

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
and then along the way

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
things

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
the downsides that are typical

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
are like okay this is not a person

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
that is always thinking about your feelings

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
when they're talking

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
because they're trying to get their thoughts straight

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
they're very comfortable

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
going off half cocked

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
they'll figure it out as they're talking

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
and

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
they love explaining

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
and they want to create

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
a system and stuff

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
and they believe the universe is a system

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
and there's something to figure out

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
and then creatively for that reason

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
endless revisions

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
and never ending

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
not finishing of projects

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
and stuff which was kind of a

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
bummer I mean how do you feel when you

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
just in general

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
when you the idea of like

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
oh there's 16 personalities here's yours

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I think the effect on me was

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
sort of like a simultaneous

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
kick in the nuts

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
and lifting

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
up

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
so not contradictory just kick to the nuts so hard

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
that you're lifted up

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
a teeter totter

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
the

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
because it's like

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
on one hand you are what you are

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
and it's kind of

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
because I think everybody wants to be special

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
for the purpose of

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
contributing everybody wants to be special

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
so that they can fit in

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
isn't that crazy people really do want a job

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
what about

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
what about Wonder Woman

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
whatever

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I did forget her

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
that's so spiteful that everybody laughed

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
at him saying Wonder Woman so much more

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
than her back there they were just like

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Wonder Woman

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
let that be a lesson

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
pick your moment

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
that's the funny way of doing it

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
right

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
stand up and walk up to the stage

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
but it is an interesting concept

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
that you get the woody

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
from Toy Story kind of thing

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
of that idea of finding out that

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
you're unremarkable

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
in a certain sense that there are others of you

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
that you're a category

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
don't look at me man

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
it can be

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
that's what the internet has

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
given us is the idea of no matter how fringe

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
you are there's always going to be at least

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
500 other people out there somewhere

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
you don't have to get in a plane to find them

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
that's uplifting always

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
oh who else here

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
I just watched the Flat Earth documentary

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
have you guys watched it

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I started watching it but I didn't get it all the way through

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
it's a little less heartbreaking and shitty

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
than you might think it is

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
because I know you know that basically

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
probably all Flat Earthers

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
I remember on this podcast I would always be like

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Flat Earthers are basically heroes right

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
because how could you commit

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
and then like everything else

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
the election changed everything because it was just sort of like

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
oh this is

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
just another expression of

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
anti-intellectual revolution

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
and like I'm not charmed by it anymore

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
but

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
it's worth watching it's a charming documentary

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
they

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
and there's some uplifting

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
parts to it too that do feel like

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
actually actionable items

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
especially

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
for people who

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
look

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
the scientific community kind of like

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
the idea that maybe it's

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
it's important to

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
that it's not

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
scientific to

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
ridicule people

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
it accomplishes nothing

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
if your scientific goal is for people to value science

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
and you know that you live in a world

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
where for whatever reason

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
there are people who are pushed so far away

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
that they're in a dark dirty corner

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
making up their own science

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
and you gotta know scientifically

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
that you're never gonna bring them back

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
by laughing at them

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
not that they're not funny

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
but if that's your goal

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
if it's your goal to bring them back

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
then you gotta know as a scientist

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
that

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
the way to bring them back is you're gonna have to

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
go way more than

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
what's fair in their direction

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
like they're not gonna meet you halfway

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
as one of them

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
there's a guy that's interviewed in it

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
and

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
he's a physicist at Caltech

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
and I recognized him because I was on a panel with him

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Rick and Morty

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
kind of science panel

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
science panel?

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I know, yeah

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
and he had such a cool

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
so many cool things to say

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
a lot of the scientists in the documentary

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
it's like there's this evolution that's being forced

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
upon us where it's like

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
hey man

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
okay so

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
now we've got this other danger

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
there's gonna be people that are gonna be so

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
like revenge of the nerds

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
happened, it's over

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
the nerds are in control

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
now there's

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
like

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
people

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
gathering in little clusters

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
who are

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
suffering from

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
confirmation bias and

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
whatever it's called Kepler Allen

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
person's project disorder

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Dunning Kruger

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
and the documentary does a really good

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
humanizing job

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
of illustrating that absolutely perfectly

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
showing their little meats

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
and editing it in such ways

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
where

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
everything kind of becomes really

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
clear and humanizes everybody

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
and

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
there's scientific communities where

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
it's like the woke version of being a scientist

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
now

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
is like they're

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
is

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
talking to each other

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
scientists that are qualified that know

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
everything talking to each other and saying

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
what are we gonna do about these guys

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
they're not going away

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
they're not enchanted by us

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
they're

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
waiting for everyone to get so

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
into fucking

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
logic that they

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
flock to us

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I love like on Twitter

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Professor Brian Cox

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
he'll engage with some flat

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
earthers once in a while and it's hilarious

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
because he just shows them images

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
and shows them like

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
and gives them a reason but

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
they only see that reason and that logic

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
as proof

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
that there's something to fight against

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
there's a really great sequence in this documentary

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
where they

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
one of the more scientifically

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
minded people is explaining

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
the difference between

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
this

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
point A to point B

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
scientific process where

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
as much as none of us

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
want to be wrong if you're a true scientist

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
you're like if I'm wrong

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I'm wrong and kind of moving forward

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
to whatever conclusion is actually there

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
and then him

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
breaking down the very common

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
reverse of that process where

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
you've decided what your conclusion

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
is and how you kind of weed

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
things out and backwards paint this arrow

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
from B to A

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
and while he's explaining that

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
you're

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
they're editing it with a conversation

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
with a wonderful charming

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
human guy that

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I don't want to see suffer

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
it was explaining that

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
he they're so into

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
flat earth that they bought

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
a $20,000 gyroscope

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
they raised the money because

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
they knew that if

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
the earth

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
really was round that

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
you should be able to get a gyroscope

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
that would register a 15 degree per hour

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
shift

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
in the tilt or whatever and they just

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
those things are really expensive so they raised the money

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and they get this $20,000 gyroscope

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
in the mail and they open it up

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
and as soon as they open it up they turn it on

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
and it's registering a 15 degree

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
an hour shift and then they start

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
putting it in different containers made of

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
different things to shield it from the

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
glass dome above us

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
because they're and so he's

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
explaining that process

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
which is an adventure to him an adventure

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
that starts with like a I know

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
what windmill is what

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
and

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
it but the

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
they're editing it back and forth of someone explaining this

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
is how this works like you

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
that the earth is flat so now

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
getting this gyroscope is just

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
it's like the Joker escaping

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
from Arkham it's like a job to do you've got to

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
figure out how to

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
defeat him and

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
and so they're trying to figure out and that

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
reminds them of experimentation

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
and science and because it looks

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
the same thing but what

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
you're doing is

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
like that guy is like

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
he's at these

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
meetups and they're like

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
he's having these like private conversations

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
over in the corner of the bonfire

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
party and he's kind of explaining to somebody like

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
yeah it's

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I'm not going to bring up

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
the gyroscope this year at the Flat Earth

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Con it's a big

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
kind of a bug bear

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
yeah

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
we're going to do some more experiments

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
I brought it up before I won't repeat

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
it but like I had a lift driver and he

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
was a Flat Earther and

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I asked him 20 questions he gave me

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
20 answers that he had

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
ready to go

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
we're all of them

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
number one here's the number one

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
the top five

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
starting with number 20 going

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
to number one

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
number 20 coming in

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
we've done this before but like

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
not all 20 of them here we go

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
20 questions and answers

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
about Flat Earth

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
he was an intelligent guy but I was like

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
you're using navigation

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
right now on your phone

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
to get me from

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
meltdown to the drawing

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
that's green

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
he had it

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
number 19

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
one of the more fascinating things is of course

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
is you might expect the division

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
like you have those solidarity but then

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
the divisions

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
the infinite plain people

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
from the pheasant under glass people

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I don't know how they differentiate but like

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
um

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
there's like

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
as soon as you become a prominent Flat Earther

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
you have a podcast that like people follow

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
now you're a dispenser of information

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
which by virtue of the same kind of oppositional defiant

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
like engine that's powering

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
the religion of the group

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
and I would say

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
if you're a woman and if you're

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
reasonably attractive

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
like this one woman is and this thing

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
like she's

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
she's easy on the eyes and she has

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
like a Skype podcast with this other guy

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
who's like

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
who literally lives in his mom's basement

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
and you really like hate these people

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
you're just sort of like oh you guys are cute

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
and um and they're because they're

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
good natured I mean they just happen to think

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
the earth is flat and they're truly dedicated to it

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
but like the crazy thing is like then the

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
the brief dip they take

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
into the dark forest of

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
okay here's what it's like to be a woman

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
and be a Flat Earther

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
because immediately

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
the last three letters of her first name

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
are CIA because she's Patricia

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
so I mean that's

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
just asking for it

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
her last name is steer so she's clearly

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
a honeypot that's been sent to seduce

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Flat Earthers and steer them the wrong

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
way toward the NASA

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
governed thing like everybody's a robot

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
and everybody's what's the first

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
day of conspiracy

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
factory

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
your office or whatever like

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
okay all right what's your name

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
we gotta change that

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
we gotta what will we do I'm thinking

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
steer because you're gonna be like why

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
would you do that's always the

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
that's such an important linchpin to

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
conspiracy theory universe is that the

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Illuminati love bragging

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
because if they didn't love bragging

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
so much of this shit wouldn't make sense at the end

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
of the day you're like why would they put

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
the ghost in Tom Selleck's living room in

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
three men and a baby because they're trying

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
to tell us they want us to

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
know

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
why would they let

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
this copy of Back to the Future get out

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
if it's crawling with 9-11 predictions

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
this movie is crawling

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
because the whole point is to do

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
9-11 right in front of you

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
it makes the 9 and the 11

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
so delicious that you knew about it

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
it's like when you soak a tortilla chip in the salsa

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
if I'm repeating a thing

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
from previous podcast and fuck it but

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Rob I told the driver I go okay

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
because I said but why

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
do we see eclipses as a circle on the moon

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
like because we're all just it's just

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
flat discs that are casting shadows and

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
things but like every time

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
like like like why is it a curve

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
and this and he had an answer of

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
a bullshit answer but he had an answer

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
and I said let's say you and

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I stood a hundred miles

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
apart on the equator and walked

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
due north

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I'm saying

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
that at one point you and I would meet each other

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
because we live on a sphere

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
and he goes no

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
we would keep walking straight I go and then

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
what would happen at the end he goes I said

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
would we fall off and he goes no because

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
there's a ridge at the end and you can't fall off

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
it's ice it's a wall of ice

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
yeah that's that's dumb

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
and I said

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
I said oh you're a moron

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
and I laugh he goes I said no I'm sorry

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
you're not a moron I go I go but

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
seriously what do you think what happened

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
he goes I said I'm gonna fly you and

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
me we're gonna be a hundred

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
miles apart on the equator and walk north

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
he goes if you pay for it I'll do it

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
that's how they get you that's how they

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
get you and now he's in Barbados

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
having a fucking time of his life what would

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
it take for you to believe in the

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
round earth

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
chicken margarita

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
if you like peanut

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I guess you're right man let's do it again

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
next summer

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
some of these guys thanks for the hotel

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
some of them

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
you bought me a hotel like the gyroscope guy

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
and then they have another experiment that they

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
want that they're doing in it throughout the movie

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
where they're like look we're so convinced

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
they and they come up with a scientific

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
idea we're gonna take three

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
beams

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
we're gonna put them they found

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
a place where okay we got 3.8 miles

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
of space

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
to play with here we're gonna put three beams

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
equidistant from each other

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
along this 3.8 mile stretch

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
3.8 miles

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
will

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
equate to a certain amount of if the

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
curvature

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
within that within that certain degree of curve

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
and so

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
but they're gonna prove that that curvature doesn't

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
exist by taking a laser

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
and shining it through

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
you know three holes

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
on these things and if the middle

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
middle one

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
is going through

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
the earth ain't flat and so

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
and then they cut to like a scientist

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
like hearing about that they just describe

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
the thing and he's like okay well

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
okay

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
alright yeah they're fucked

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
like he's kind of like yeah no actually

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
I

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
it sounds like they're

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
in trouble

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
that's a real experiment that you can do they're going to

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
prove that the earth is round accidentally

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
and they're gonna be bummed out

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
and yeah and I won't spoil it but

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
but

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
but it is kind of interesting

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
spoilers the earth is round

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
it's kind of like it's kind of like not

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
entirely

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
there's like so many different camps and like

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
even just sort of culturally and that

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
it's not as much as I thought it would be

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
where it's just like

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
I'm gonna sharpen my buoy knife

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
and blame the Jews for everything

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
and it makes me feel empowered

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
to do the

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
scientific equivalent of saying

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I don't know that

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
you know that I didn't do you know

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
and it's like there's a lot more

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
joy and

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
for some of the people who are like the engineers

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
they're like they're out there

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
doing these Boy Scout experiments

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
so they're gonna but the only thing

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
about it is that they're not gonna take

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
no for an answer they're gonna because

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
and there's a very interesting

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
analysis of that concept too

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
like where it's like what would you actually do

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
if it was these guys they have they

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
have awards shows they give each other awards

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
they're experiencing joy they're experiencing

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
I wish

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I could I wish a cult would take me

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
that that's

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
the joy is you see these groups together like

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
if you know not that Comic Con is similar

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
but it is similar in that you will

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
see people together that you would never

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
see together and it's a

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
great thing so like I hear you on like

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
you don't want to wake them up

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
yeah but they and then the

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
the documentary does take responsibility

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
with some minor piano chords at a certain

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
point when it touches on like these

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
people have children

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
you know and that's not funny

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
it's not fun it's like

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
it's cute you get caught up and like this is cute

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
this is cute this is cute and then it's like

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
the children

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
it's like an American movie with

54:08.000 --> 54:08.000
what's his name

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Bortchurch or

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
yeah well yeah I did think of that

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
in my head I was thinking about that

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
this is awesome this guy just wants to make movies

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
then second act or third act

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
oh he has three children

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
he has like nine

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
I was like yeah

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
alright moving on

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
boy we got so much to cover

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
alright let's start

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
part two

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I've already talked about this

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
here we go part two

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I've already talked about it

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
after a commercial break

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
we're gonna go back Dan's gonna

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
blow your mind with the second half

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I've already talked about this

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
last week I talked about wrong place wrong time

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
this is another true crime

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
uh

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
linguistic

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
thing I would like to

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
that irritates you

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
you don't like it

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
welcome to the part of the podcast we call

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
words

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
wait wait wait

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Dan doesn't like something

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
everybody listen up

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
I didn't deserve that at all

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
no no no go ahead

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
that's like if I was

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
backing a truck of chicken

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
out of a

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
restaurant and stopped

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
for a marathon of bicyclists

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
and the last one kicked my truck

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
I fucking waited

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
and I got chicken to move

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
you guys are just dicking around

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
trying to act Italian

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
I'm sorry

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I'm sorry

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
that he thinks it's Italian

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Dan I'm sorry

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I've made fun of you

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
get off

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
my lawn

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
words

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
get off my lawn

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I'm going to do this for at least 30 more

56:48.000 --> 56:54.000
times by the way

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
alright Dan what's on your mind

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
look I just

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
I've said it before I'll say it again

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I think that

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
when we're dealing with children's

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
undergarments in true crime shows

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
they can all be

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
underwear

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I don't understand why a 3 year old

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
missing girl

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
if you find her underwear

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
why do we have to call them panties

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I don't

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
I understand

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
like I'm not saying if you're a parent

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
and you call your toddlers

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
underwear if there's a girl

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
like if you feminize the underwear

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
the forensic thing

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
and then we took the panties

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
and we looked for semen

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
like why do they have to

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
they can just be underwear

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
that's not going to be an inaccurate way to describe them

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
no one's going to go like what

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
did you have a dick

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
they're still underwear

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
panties is just a kind of

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
substrate of underwear

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
that we use when we want to feminize

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
undergarments

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
I hope at this point we cut to me and Spencer doing

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
me andy's ad

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
but it's just like remember the

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
John Bonet special and like

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
I love him

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Henry Lee like the rockstar

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
but he was just like

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
there was a John Bonet special

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
thick accent and he's just like oh

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
it took panty and all the panty and the semen

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
stain oh there's so much semen under panty

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
and I was just like

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
the special

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
it was a special like they did the rainbow

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
special

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
and then like

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
yeah the solid gold dancers came out

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
it wasn't a series and it wasn't a movie

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
what do you fucking want from me

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
he was that special

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
what is it if it's not a series or a movie

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I don't want to hear the word panties anymore

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
unless

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
you're over a certain age

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
I don't want to

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
we found your panties

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I don't like it

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
panties is a weird word just to begin with

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
panties they're like they can retire that shit

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
yeah also like you know what

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
cookies like we

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
everything's cooked but we got

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
the only one thing is a cookie

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
they should be called bakies

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
if I make an omelet

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
that's a cookie too

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
I cooked my omelet

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
alright

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
you like that

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I'm on board

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Rob what do you think about that

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
it doesn't say where did cookie come from

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
that had to be

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
yeah

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
do you care to call them biscuits we call them cookies

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
that seems fucking way too sweeping

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
for me

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
you never cook a cookie

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
you bake a cookie

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
you bake a cookie

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
and there's no way that the

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
cookie technology is so old

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
that it's like we fucked up

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
do you pop a sickle

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
no

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
what's up Seinfeld

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
what's wrong with people

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
who has ever popped a sickle

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
why do they call them sweaters

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
there's no ice and ice cream

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
what's up

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
there's a little bit of ice

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
yeah cause panties is like

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
you said there's no ice

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
you said there's absolutely no ice

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
it's not true

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
remember me

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
sit down

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
sit down

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
by Jove I think she's got it

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I think she's got it

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I'm dedicated to accuracy

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I'm a good girl I am

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I won't tolerate Misha Goss

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
anybody know how this Captain Marvel

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
movie did this weekend

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
anybody here

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
on it's way to make one billion dollars

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
the consistent thing right now in March

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
which is a support for women's

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
month

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
at least this thing that said

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
now statistically

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
women's movies make more than men's movies

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
so let's make more women's movies

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and get that sweet sweet paper

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
alright

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I agree

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
cause then we can make more dick movies

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
it does seem like an end run cause like the tradition

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
the old 80's tradition is like

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
oh the ladies movie

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
flowers of forgotten

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
love and then you're like

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
the chauvinist male is like

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
chick flick or whatever but it's like

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
there's so much steam behind

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
the idea that

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
if Captain Marvel's a woman and we're making progress

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
it's like the guys could just

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
if they could just calm the fuck down

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
and sit back what they're getting on a silver platter

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
is like they're doubling

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
their

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
their control over

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
their hegemony cause like now

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
their girlfriend's gonna be like

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I wanna go see Wonder Woman and it's like

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
well thank god there's fucking lasers in it

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
like don't

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
take your fucking blessings

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
whatever the expression

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
take your gift horse's teeth

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
and put them in a cup

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
and get the hell out of that tooth bank

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
tooth bank

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
sorry what were you saying Brandon? that was it

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
that was saying tooth bank and when's the Harlem Man movie

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
coming out? Harlem Man

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
what is Harlem Man's

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
origin story Dave?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
he was bit by

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
he was in a tenement building

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
his momma sent him down

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
to the furnace room

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
the boiler room but there were drug dealers down there

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
that were using the boiler

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
to hide

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
contraband but what they didn't know is that

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
the contraband was actually like a new

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
it was like a new designer drug that was using

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
LexCorp funded like microwave

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
radiation and it made

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
the boiler blow up

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
giving him the power to

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
speak

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
the truth

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
so you're just going to rip off the Jackson 5

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
same premise

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
same premise

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
all five of them

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
all five of them

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
all five just went down to the boiler room

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
when they went down there there was only one of them

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
oh that's their power

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
to speak the truth

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
it's like they

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
they blast them down until like an array of

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Jackson's

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
they're like Voltron like Jermaine's

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
like the arm and fucking

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Tito's the leg and fucking

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Tito is the leftovers

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
ah

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
come on

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
give Tito a break man

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
what happened to Rockwell?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
man I feel like there's these times in life

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
where you make just enough money and you're like alright

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I feel like that dude

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
he was Barry Gordy's kid

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
he was already kind of rich

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
he made it

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I always feel like somebody's watching me

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
but the lyrics are like it's Rockwell

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
who's Michael Jackson's cousin

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
just going like

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
hey it's me Rockwell

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
and I took a shower

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
and I got kinda scared

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
that someone was gonna stab me and then it's like

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Michael Jackson comes in for the

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I always feel like

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
oh that's Michael Jackson

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
that's cheating

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
it's absolutely cheating

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
it's like the way

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Phil Collins will use sting sometimes

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
but you know what

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I just watched Purple Rain again

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
what's his name

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Morris Day

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
that's his movie

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Prince is not a great actor

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
he's a great performer but he's a shit actor

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
in the same way that David Bowie is not a great actor

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
he's a great performer

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
but fucking Morris Day he's good in that movie

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I mean I'm team Prince

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
in that movie and it polarizes you

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
you do have to pick a side

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I'm just saying

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
the movie that demands you pick a side

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
it fucking absolutely does

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
didn't Morris Day in the Times

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
break up just before that movie came out

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
like

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
no I felt like they were together for a little while

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
because the ice cream album

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Ice Cream Castles is right after the show

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
you are young

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
nicely done

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
you are free

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
let's be together

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
interracially

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
yeah

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
you are white

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
vanilla

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
and chocolate

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I just came up with this

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
the fucking bird

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
the bird fucking rocks

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
and then he did the oak tree

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
because he was like give that bird a place to land

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
then he did

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
but he was all about the cashmere

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
then he did the end table

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
or camel hair

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
what was it

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
he had the white fucking coat on

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
but it's crazy because

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
it's two hair bands basically

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
going at each other in Minnesota

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
and there's a rivalry and he's a bad guy

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
they all go to each other's shows

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
and they all stand in the back

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
like it's like

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
look at this motherfuckers eye makeup

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
but then the prince

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
what was it

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
yeah

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I love that he licks his hand first

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
like oh I've got to clean myself

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
yeah he's like a little

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
you bring a mirror out

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
greatest job in all of music

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
is to hold a mirror

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
for Morris Day

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
is that purple rain

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
the

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
what album

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
is Take Me With You on

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
it's purple rain

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
so best part of that song

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
to be around you

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
oh so that

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
you're sheer perfection

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
thank you

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
such a great

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
yeah

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
you don't get that kind of reciprocity

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
like it's just healthy

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
it's self care

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
like the therapist was

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
wandering through the studio that day

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
and was like keep that in

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
like

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
we were going to cut it

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
thank you

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
you know why she said it

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
she felt complimented

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
the same therapist told James Brown

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
it's okay to want to kiss yourself

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
jump back first

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
don't hurt yourself

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
kiss yourself

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
okay well I don't know

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
why I keep looking at my notes

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I got panties and Briggs Meyer test

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
I didn't even write down panties

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I knew I was going to remember that

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
it's a weird word

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I just hear it all the time

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
yeah it's not good

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I found a new true kind podcast

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
lobster

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
that's a strange one

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
continue

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
get off

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
my lobster

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
what's your beef with lobster Rob?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
well it's two words

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
together

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
and it doesn't describe

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
what it is

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
it's just two syllables together

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
it's not two words

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
lobster is not a word

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
it kind of is a foreboding thing

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
but they're going to be lobbed into water

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
and then stirred into their doom

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
it could be a mnemonic device

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
then I love it

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
how do you feel about hamster?

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I love that too

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
hey what the fuck is a gerbil?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
is there a wild gerbil?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
did gerbils exist in the wild?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
he was the

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Hitler's propaganda minister

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I think

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
are there gerbils and hamsters in the wild?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
what about guinea pigs?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
they're not pigs

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
are they from guinea?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
just

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
the greatest part

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
he is staring at you and you refuse to look

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
that 90% is

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
the greatest fucking thing

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
it's what

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
it's what black kids

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
oh no

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
exterminate

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
exterminate

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
rob is weaponized his desk

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
gerbils are really mean hamsters

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
that don't do tricks

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
whereas a hamster can fill its side pouches with food

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
a gerbil is like a domesticated rat

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
wow

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
my mom was a daycare center teacher

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
for gerbils?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
yeah for gerbils

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
fucking so much money

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
you know what I mean?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
so much fucking money man

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
so much fucking money

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
making that gerbil money

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
so we would get

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
wasn't that the love interest in issue 3 of Harlem Man

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
the daycare center teacher

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
the underpaid like

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I told you you can't come here till the students are gone

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I just wanted to warn you

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
that Lex Luth is up to no good again

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I wish he was doing something like helping these kids

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
girl I have so much on my mind

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I can't help nobody right now

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
girl that's your job

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
to take care of the children while I fly into the sky

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
we need you more than ever right now

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
you stupid

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I will never eat your pussy

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
whatever

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Aquaman gonna be there

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and he wants to

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
you gotta make us look good

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
cause he says he's better than you

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
oh because he can swim

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
hey hey sorry sorry sorry

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
this is great but

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
okay I thought about bringing up this before

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and I said I don't want to interrupt

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
but now I do

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
so

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
okay so

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
why you were referring to like Aquaman

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
was like a punchline

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
hey why don't you go talk to fish

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000

you can see Aquaman

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
it goes in a really weird direction

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
starts off with a lot of weird shit

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
a fish is the SUV of worms

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
fucking shots fired

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
evolutionarily you've taken no risks

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
you've just added to fucking gas tanks

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
see over smaller cars

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I would like to talk to

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
like a seahorse

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
just to say like what's up with that

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
like evolutionarily

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000

I'm trying to get drunk

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
they're just a bunch of snot that lives forever

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I'll sign it for that job

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
like you can't fuck up a jellyfish

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
unless it runs into a boat

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
like they live forever

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
they're immortal

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
why isn't there jellyfish man

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
you should get on that

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
you're doing all this superhero stuff

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
you're doing it

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
you're doing it

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
put jellyfish man in there

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
story bully

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
you don't call it man-a-war

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
you call it woman-a-war because it's

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
what about Wonder Woman

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
thank you it was stupid

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
somebody in the car went stupid

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
and I'm on your side sir

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
did someone call woman-a-war

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
but

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
but she's not portuguese

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
isn't portuguese man-a-war

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
alright

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
there's like a whole whitewash scandal

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
they're like why didn't they cast a portuguese person

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
we had to make it a woman

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
why is woman-a-war from basque country

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
so close to lisbon you could have done a fucking

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
two lightskins to play a portuguese man-a-war

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
they're saying that will smith

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
is two lightskins

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
to play

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I didn't know there was more

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I'm just going to let that shit sit right there

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
next on Harmontown

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
two lightskins to what

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
he's two lightskins to play serena williams dad

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
after just having played a blue genie

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I don't know what the fuck

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
you cannot

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
you cannot make people happy

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
we have talked about the whole like

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
what was the shazam alibaba

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
sinbad

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
the thing that millennials

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
where they think that they're living in a parallel universe

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
because they think they remember a movie

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
but

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
it seems clear to gen Xers

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
what's going on is that they're just

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
racist

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
that they're kind of like they conflated

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
like different thoughts

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
constructs and things where they're like there's a guy named sinbad

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
and then there's like this

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
anyways alright

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
and then baronstein bears things

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
anti-semites

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
also not real bears

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
the baronstein bears is crawling

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
with 9-elevens did we ever

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
did anybody

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
did anybody ever

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
did anybody ever

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
did we ever activate anybody to look into

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
that hadge pock

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
lick well like

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
baron trump traveling through china

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I don't know I didn't did any

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
I even nobody cared

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
what happened

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
oh sorry how do I

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
catch you up

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
there was a rob found a thing

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
it was like a youtube video by a guy

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
who found a book

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
published in the 1800s

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
about a kid named baron trump

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
who travels through time and becomes the last president

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
or whatever I'm getting some details wrong

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
but

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I'm sure somebody

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
on reddit said

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
we were wrong

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
was that an actual thing

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
like fudging that

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I don't know there's a book called

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
1900 or the last president

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
that is about

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
a

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
a little boy who

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
is called baron trump

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
whose mentor is named

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
the don and

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
he lives on fifth avenue

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
in new york where trump tower is

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
and this is legit or this is

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
apparently yeah I mean like

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I mean we don't really know

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
we'd have to read the

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
book this is what the video is saying is the

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I think we're hoping that in a world where

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
if I clear my throat wrong

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
there's 10 paragraphs written about it

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
that we could maybe use that energy

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
in our favor and like have people

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
you know go out and

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
research this thing

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
are they really commenting on you

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
that way

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I actually did go through the reddit because again I

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I was looking for my

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
my real audio porn

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
and

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I was glad I stumbled through there

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
because it wasn't like lethal

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
like it was an uplifting

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
feeling like you probably shouldn't

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
live your life you probably shouldn't

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
have shit you refuse to do

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
in places you refuse to go

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
that's probably no matter what

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
as much as that feels like self-care

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
at certain points

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
and maybe temporarily that's a good measure

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
like withdraw from something

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
build a wall but

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
not the best word

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
the word wall

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
you probably don't want that there forever

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
because it's like having a cast

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
on your leg you're gonna

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
so what did you discover

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
and I just looked through and I was like well this isn't that bad

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
what's the worst someone's gonna say

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
he's a despicable asshole

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
like well prove it

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
so are you

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
also it's better to

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
read it from

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
distance

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
more importantly a bunch of nice stuff

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
like clearly just a bunch of people who are very

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
like they're like

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
you know somebody like

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
there was a thread where somebody was like

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I hate this reddit behavior

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
but like or I should just call it online behavior

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
someone's like can someone

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
satisfy a question for me and he's just like

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
this isn't gonna be a real question and there's like

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
what is it you find entertaining about this podcast

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
because I just doesn't it just seem like

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
it's just a terrible prayer you just don't understand

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I really I genuinely love

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I'm not doing anything that

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
would make me accountable to an opinion

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
and stating it in an unhealthy way

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I'm genuinely just seeking information

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
like please please tell me

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
tell me how to enjoy Harmontown

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
and what was nice was just like

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
just like a gentle cascade

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
like like of

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
a bunch of people going sounds like it's not for you

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
and it was like like

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
oh that's got to be the result of a

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
cultivation of something even if it's just

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
wearing people down

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
just erosion of the human psyche but like

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
like just it was just softness

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
it was just like a million people

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
going like yeah I don't I mean yeah

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I don't why would you why would you

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
get on the internet listen to something and then

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
don't don't sounds like you hate it get out of here

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
not not get out of here

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
but just people and then and then laced

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
within there people going like yeah

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
what are you gonna do a guy guy talks

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
for two hours a week for fucking

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
80 years like

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
oh boy

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
what a what a what a terrible time that one time

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
was who cares like they're they're the

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Facebook group actually mobilizes

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
raises funds does things

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
reaches out to each other they like treat each

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
other like family there's less

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
like shit talking it's actually super

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
interesting to see which

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
which medium

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Facebook

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
this guy loves Facebook I do love

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
you should call you you should call you Brandon

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
face that's not an original

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
book you got to

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
have a hidden drunk the Facebook

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
drunk and your name doesn't lend itself to

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
wordplay at all

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
two weeks ago you said I'm bad at names

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
but it is cool to see like that

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
versus the reddit because

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
they they're the same

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
it's the same fan base but they're

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
two totally different kids

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
like those cats are like

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
on Facebook they're like we're raising

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
money for and

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
so and so feels down so let's let's lend a little

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
love versus some of the

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
criticism that we receive on reddit I had

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
an epiphany because I'm listening to this new

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
podcast like Cody and I call him Asperger

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
detective leader

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
the the title of the show

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
is called like cold case

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
something it's the most innocuous title

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
it's like cold case murder files

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
or something it's like the most generic thing

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
and it's just this guy

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
his name is Kyle something

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
and he's like hey everybody

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
it's me Kyle something

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
and I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna tell you

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
about the JonBenét Ramseym

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
case and this is a very

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
curious case because a lot

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
of people have a lot of opinions about it

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
but what they don't understand is that it's

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
all about evolution swarming

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
and the redirection of light

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
and he's so

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
so

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
spectromy that it all

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
goes continually almost to the

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
point of sexy and

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
before plummeting

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
into

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
he's a personality and we're addicted

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
to him and we like him and we

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
but like I had

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
kind of an epiphany while Cody was reading

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
his iTunes reviews

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
because I was like people are going to be mean

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
to this guy because he sounds

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
like he's sucking on a Jolly Rancher all the time

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
like the microphone is like real close

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
to his mouth and so there's just sort of like this

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
like

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
it

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
and I

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Asperger detective

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
and people were like hitting his like

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
just everything about his inflection

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
because for a while he has

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
a pattern where every sentence has to

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
end like this and there's all of these

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
he's explaining everything and I'm explaining

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
everything and and so everyone's like

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
what are you a valley girl why does the sentence have to go

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
like people are really and I was like

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I was like listening to these things and I

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
was cringing on his behalf

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
but and then atoning

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
with that that cosmic force

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
because I was like boy I

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
sure hope

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
that this

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
doesn't

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
affect him

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
and I think these

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
because

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
what good would that do

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I mean

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
outside of like if he was like oh I should take the Jolly Rancher

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
out and I think you can hear him like

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I think you can hear him start to like try to

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
force himself to like I think he is

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
like we were Cody and I were analyzing and going

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I think he is seeing some of this stuff and it is

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
maybe

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
hurting him or not but in any case he's like

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
adjusting and

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
but but the most important thing like

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
like

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
oh god what like

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I don't know it's just like fresh eyes on this

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
concept of like people have like

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
talking about him because he's a product

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
he's put himself out there

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
he has 13 listeners

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
he has 13

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
patreons

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
patreons

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
and so he's like

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
he's not worth

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
taking down

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
but people are drifting through

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
and they're like they got a lot to say

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
some people

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
have a lot to say about how deep and thoughtful he is

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
some people

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
really go for the jugular about

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
his very on the cuff

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
flaws

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
and

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
it was just sort of an educational process for me to go

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
oh well

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
okay I hear all that

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I can laugh at all that I can

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
they observe the same thing they're observing but

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
god what a tragedy it would be

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
if he let any of this

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
like fuck up his day

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
I don't know

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I don't think I'm able to articulate my point

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
there's just sort of like

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
then putting myself back in the

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
position where it's like wait a minute

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
you're a fucking dude

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
like putting this thing out it's a product

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
you're a build-a-bear

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
you're a character you're a thing

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.360
talk about you and they don't want, none of them would want you to ever be like,

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:54.960
oh well that's gonna make me change everything about my life or I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill myself

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:59.760
now or I'm gonna stop doing this or start doing that because they would be like, whoa, whoa,

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.960
whoa, what part of me listening didn't you understand? I'm just like, the internet is where

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:09.760
you can just type about this stuff. I'm just a couple of ear holes like sucking your shit in

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.240
and I got nothing to say so I may as well say about this. Like, I didn't want you to fucking have

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:20.640
an opinion about the human species because, because of this stuff, but I can't figure out,

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:24.480
you know, at what point you're supposed to- It's a weird motivation. I just don't know,

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.320
like, because I was like, I don't think anybody wants you in the subreddit really, like, because

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.800
as much as they'd be excited that you were there, in the long term they'd be like,

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:40.880
what am I supposed to, like, police myself and talking about, oh I hate it when he talks about

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.600
this or when he does that. A little bit. Maybe they should, but. A little bit. A little bit,

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:56.400
because we really are doing the best that we can. And we make a product, and sometimes we dip in

01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.480
there to see how the product's getting received because we want to make sure that you like the

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:04.880
shit we like. But if people wanted to have to worry about that, they'd go to their own Thanksgiving

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:10.400
dinners. Like, oh, Uncle Bob heard you talking about the Packers and now he's throwing a shit

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.440
fit in the kitchen and it's like, that's the thing that people are getting away from when they

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.400
consume other people. Strangers. They just go, oh, and they, and they actually, if anything, they

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:24.080
like to, like, I think they, you know, you pour more into it in terms of like love and hate and

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.960
like judgment and opinions and stuff. It's like actually a reflection of how far, how hard you're

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:36.400
trying to get away from the mess that is your own life. They're just like, oh, I hate Becky on the

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.640
home shopping channel when she honks that horn. Like, you're just, you're engaging in consumption.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.920
If you keep it at that level, when you start to make it personal, though, it's certainly something

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:52.160
that you need to question your motivation. Because like, when I open my mouth to speak,

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:57.200
I'm trying to make people laugh or do something decent versus like somebody who thinks that

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:02.320
they're crafting some incredible shit talk. That's a whole different beast at which points

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.400
you're sort of calling yourself out. So there's a, there's a point that you made that I agree with,

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:11.200
which is like, you're, you're trying to run away from your own shitty life by talking shit. And I,

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.680
I definitely think people should be allowed to talk shit. But when it gets personal, you got to

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:22.560
ask yourself, am I, do I, am I negating that this person has experiences that they've been through

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:30.160
that my comments might actually trigger? Like, I don't want to shit on, I'm not necessarily a David

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:35.120
Hasselhoff fan, but I'm not going to be like, David Hasselhoff's album, I'm not going to make an

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:41.600
account and a fake name just so I can get on a Yahoo chat board and go, David, David Hasselhoff

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:47.440
sucks. And here's the 15 reasons why. Like at that point, David Hasselhoff maybe needs to call you

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:53.200
up and say you outside because I'm outside. At that point, because there, there is this part

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:58.000
where I'm like, if you're so creative with your words, why the fuck would you choose to put me

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.320
down? That's like, I travel a lot and I go and yelp all the time just to find a place to eat, like

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.120
find some vegetarian food or find the bar or find like a place like that's got this or that,

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:13.680
whatever, I'm craving Italian food or whatever. And I go and yelp places that I know that I like,

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:18.880
like, you know, like I've always, I always go to this place in Seattle and I always go to that,

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:25.600
these two places in Portland and awesomely they have bad reviews because like that means the

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:30.000
assholes aren't going there. Like you read the bad reviews and it was some douchebag that had a bad

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.760
date and like, like he won't be there. But like, I know that I can have fun in that place because

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:41.680
like I don't want to see like 7,000 five star reviews on a place because that means everybody's

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:50.560
there. Like, like, so like, sometimes the negativity helps you like, yeah, filter out the tritus.

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:57.040
Yeah, I do think anonymity is like key to our species problem as we join as we move from

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:04.560
real to digital. Like that is just absolutely the key is this concept of anonymity. Because we're,

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:12.560
we are, I have had my career affected by anonymous people. That is something that we were supposed

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:17.600
to reserve for black and white photographs in certain sections of history books that because

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:25.040
that is a brick through a window. You know, like a the reason why Facebook kind of heralded the mass

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.880
migration of our parents to the internet was because what they perceived there was something

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:36.080
different from my space, which was, Oh, so I know who I am. And I know who my uncle is. And if I'm

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:44.320
playing Farmville, I can there is there this idea that we could actually just move what we're accustomed

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:50.720
to over onto a digital platform. And then it's like, it's as if we're in the right now, we're in the

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:56.720
worst of both worlds. Because we're, we're just in this process of spending all of our time online.

01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:06.640
But we, we were online is currently a place that it the ratio of anonymity to importance

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:12.800
is really something that unlike any culture we've ever experienced. I just think of like

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:17.200
carnival when we were in Venice, and we were learning about the history of this concept of

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:21.920
carnival, where it was like, Oh, they did this one thing. And they thought it was like a one time

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:27.440
thing. And then like the, the nobles were like, we should do this for a month. Oh, like wear masks

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:32.640
and rape people. Yeah. Like, like, like, and like, all of this culture like started to like

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:37.120
overtake the city where it was like, everyone was like, Yeah, this is great. We should just

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:44.800
all do this all the time. I'm a bird. I'm not john. I'm a bird. And like, I do what birds do. And it

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:48.720
was like, it was a sort of like, I remember learning about it and being like, this sounds

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:55.040
very, this is what I've what we're experiencing right now, where it's like, there's a anonymity

01:31:55.040 --> 01:32:01.680
in it. In some, some respects, like it's, it can be like a super powerful liberating thing. But

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:08.400
overall, the idea that I think it brings out really, really terrible things. Like it does

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:13.280
because it's the lack of accountability. The only thing keeping you a good monkey is the fear

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:19.280
of all the monkeys beating you up. They, they, they did experiments with bots where they tried

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:25.680
to create politeness bots, where that would detect inflammatory language on Twitter, come into a

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:32.720
conversation and say, Hey, this is this is much easier to program a bot this way than it is to

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:38.000
like a bot that is also easy, which is just like detects Trump's name and just comes in and goes

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:47.520
like nothing burger. But they made, they tried using bots that would like detect like, spikes of

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:55.600
like, energy inflammatory conversations and come in and just be that person in a, in a conflict that

01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:01.840
says to an aggressor, Hey, this other person's a person, even though ironically, the bot is not a

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.240
person. Maybe you should think of them as a person, that kind of stuff, just kind of kind of like a

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:11.360
lifeguard or something like that. Or maybe like one of those like speed trap mannequins in a cop

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:14.880
car, where it's like they don't have enough cops. And they just, they actually do just want people

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:18.160
to slow down. They don't want to give tickets. So they just put a mannequin in a cop car.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:26.240
But, and what they found, I think is very interesting, which is that it is absolutely the,

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:31.520
the bots work, that you'll get, you'll get, you'll get people to backpedal, cool down all these

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:38.880
things. If the bot, in addition to doing that has a ton of followers. The is an absolute direct

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:44.000
proportion between like, if the bot has two followers and comes in and says like, Hey,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.120
everybody take it easy. They just, they're just tinder on the fire. It's just like, Fuck, another

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:55.360
faggot. And if they have 100 followers, if they have 1000 followers, if they have 10,000 followers,

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:59.520
it just gets proportionately like, it's more likely that this person who doesn't know this

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:04.480
person because they're a bot, but they have 10,000 illusory followers, the person was more likely

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:09.520
to check themselves before they wrecked themselves. And, and, and the definition of wrecking yourself

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.960
is quite simply like everybody has one primal fucking chimpanzee fear, which is you're not

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:19.040
going to live on your own. If everybody gangs up on you and decides you're a douchebag,

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:23.680
you're going to be in the forest wandering around, trying to figure out as a monkey with

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:29.040
those as an ape with no tail, like how to how to avoid spotted leopards when you don't even have

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:34.640
your friends yelling at you. You're dead. That's how chimpanzees kill each other. They just,

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:40.480
they just send Bob Dole off into the woods. They don't bother to rip their nuts off unless

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:45.520
they're young and like trying to start some shit. The old problematic ones, they just go, See you.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:54.320
And they go, For real me now? Oh, because to be a chimpanzee and to live alone is to die. And

01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:02.480
that is why solitary confinement is, you know, torture and et cetera. So, so, so that's the

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:10.800
thing anonymity. If you, that's the, I don't, I think that's, that's fucked up. If you have pure

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:16.400
anonymity on the internet, you're, you're taking an end run around that shit. And I think it's also

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:20.400
actually kind of uplifting if you, because you get, you get, you get in arguments with anonymous

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:26.640
people and they, they can't help but have an attachment to their ego. Anyway, their name is

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:33.920
AIDS Spud. I'm here to piss off women's 69, eat your pussy. Fuck and fuck you. Like, like, like,

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:37.440
they're just, they couldn't have made a clearer decision that they're, what they're going to do

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:42.480
is they're going to go and troll on the internet. It's in the way that you use it. I'm cutting my

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:48.240
fucking hair weird and I'm going to get on there with my bird mask and I'm going to fuck up women.

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:53.680
And you, you could have a conversation with one of these characters and like a lot of times like

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:58.560
they'll be like, yeah, but what about this? And it's like, wait, what, this fucking kid, like,

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:04.080
decided to be absolutely anonymous. They're put, they're wearing a screen mask and wearing a whole,

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:11.360
a running around with a butcher knife and still a lot of them will defend themselves, which they're

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.480
like, I'm not an asshole. Like, why would you care about that when you did all of this, put all

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:22.400
this energy? And the answer is because of that, that fear that unites us, which is, fuck, I'm,

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:30.640
I don't want to empirically be found out to be a liability to the species because I will,

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:36.000
it's like fun is fun and games are games and fantasies of lack of accountability are great.

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:45.440
But everybody except sociopaths, like, they can be counted on to have that kind of fear. And I,

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.160
I guess I'm old, but I'm kind of like, can we start implementing this now can, or at least

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.280
can you please like, if you're talking to someone who you know, like their birth certificate is

01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:00.480
their username, like, that's, that's what being famous means. I'm not my name isn't Mr. Fucking

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:06.800
Pickles, dude. I'm like, I'm not doing a character. I'm like a guy, like I was born in 1973 and the

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:13.120
name and the fucking thing and the barcode and the baby footprint. It's my username on Instagram,

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:21.200
my girlfriend too. Like, so you, you're punching down if you have an account that's like,

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:29.360
stick a pine tree up your pussy to 10247333 Trump forever, and you're just like, your girlfriend's

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:34.480
a gold digger and you're a piece of shit. And it's like, like, like, like, okay, you, now that

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:40.640
you have that power, what are you going to fucking do with it? You, you, you wretched fucking little

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:47.840
shit that I was when I was 11. We were like running across each other's yards back then.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.240
It was like, oh, if anybody that said, get off my lawn, they were like, oh, you're evil or my brother.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:38:00.240
Get off my lawn, you're evil, evil, evil, evil.

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:10.560
What about that? Hey, this is what about a lawn that what about like a like a monster house,

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:18.320
but the lawn is the lawn is a mummy. The lawn is a mummy.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:25.280
Mummy lawn, mummy lawn, mummy lawn. Why do they mummify the lawn?

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:32.160
The grass is mummified the lawn to wrap, wrapped up in grass.

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:39.600
Oh, so the grass is the is the wrapping. Yeah, man. So the lawn, so the, we, we walk by

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:44.720
lawns every day and we just think, oh, there's some nice grass, but underneath that grass,

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:50.240
it's all mummies. All mummies. Or at least that one house. That one house. What about a,

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:57.520
what about a Pixar movie called lawns? And each lawn is like a celebrity. And, but there's a lawn

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:06.320
that wants to be on another lawn. Is it called the grass is always greener? No. I thought it was

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:11.200
called lawn. It's called lawns. It sounds like it's called rape culture. It's because I wish I could

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:21.600
be on a lawn. It's not going to work. It's important that I have a place where I can work through

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:27.040
these ideas. Yeah. Thank God. I mean, if I, if I was at home thinking about this, I wouldn't

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.520
have any feedback. I'd be like, well, maybe I should pitch this might end up on CBS. You

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:36.160
might end up forced to watch it. Your children might grow up right now in Sweden. They're writing

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:41.520
all these ideas down and building a studio behind it. What if, what if, what if a tree

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.080
grew upside down? What if it was like,

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:53.680
like what if it roots? Did you say a root root? What if the roots are up in the air

01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:00.400
and then the tree was going down into the ground, right? Yeah, let's call it roots.

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.480
Okay. All right. Moving on. What, what about mail? What about mail?

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:12.240
Like, no one knows the secret life of mail. My name, Barry.

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:19.520
Like, uh, you know, the, the postmaster drops off the mail and then like, like, so then you have

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:26.320
like Cliff Clavin's like the voice of a catalog and he's like, oh boy, I can't wait to get taken

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:33.680
up to the dining room table. And then there's like a new character who's like, I'm a citation

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:38.880
or something. I don't know. Yeah, you don't really have relationships with your, your mail. What?

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:46.560
What about a world? Sorry, what? I didn't mean to

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:55.440
do that. I'm a little sleep deprived trying to be anonymous. What about a world where automobiles

01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:02.320
are wheels, but instead of the, but they have four little cars, right? Okay. All right. See,

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:07.360
this guy, why am I trying to do this? You're the master. This is what I do guys. The car is made

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:14.000
of wheel. The cars, the cars are wheels and they have four cars. You call it as wheels. Yeah,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.240
yeah. Each wheel is a car. Yeah. Yeah. Do they have a relationship with the macro car? Or is

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:26.720
it fractal based? Is it like, do the, if you zoom in on the, no, it can't be. What fractal? Well,

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.800
I mean, like if you zoom in on the cars that are the wheels, you're not going to see, you're

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:45.520
going to see regular cars, not wheel cars. No, they have little legs. Wait, describe the wheel

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:50.320
for me on a car. We see a cargo by, I zoom in on the front left wheel and what do I, what am I

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:56.320
looking at? There are no wheels on the baby cars. No, I'm talking about like, well, don't do that

01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:02.240
to yourself. I didn't mean to take it to the, like, like just, he, his original pitch. Okay. Yeah.

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.880
I'm confused. You got a car. You got, you know how there's like a, usually there's like a chassis,

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:12.400
so picture like a VW Beetle. Gotcha. Now just picture a wheel in place of that. Gotcha. Okay.

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:17.520
And then you're like, and then you go, well, what, what the hell? And then you're like, what are the,

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:22.080
what are the tires on this thing? Right. So there's four of them, right? Yeah. So each of the four

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:28.400
tires on that, on that tire car, you look, and then they, they're little Volkswagen's. Yeah.

01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:35.520
Like skates, like, like a big, a big tire with skates. Yeah. On each side. Yeah. A total of four.

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.440
Oh, so it's done. And then those, and then those have legs. Well, I don't think you have to do

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:43.280
legs. I did that because you put me in a corner. Yeah, I don't, I don't, I think, I think that's

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.840
the thing. It's like, you got to know when to take the drawing away from the kid. You know. No,

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.080
no, no. Okay. So that's, that's where we start. That's where we start. I think if there's a sequel,

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:54.080
we could go there. The wheels don't spin. There's just a car at the bottom of each wheel. Well,

01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:58.000
you call it, you call it opposite day. So everything, you know, like it's, you know,

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:06.080
so a helicopter would be the blade is where we sit and a body would spin. Exactly. Right. Yeah.

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:13.280
And then in a parachute would open itself up and a person would come out. Right. Right. And then,

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:20.400
and then, and then the tree, this could work with your, this could be cinematic universe,

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:27.360
the tree grows down, the roots grow up, and the wheel goes round and round. And your plants water

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:32.560
you. Yeah. Every morning, your plant comes over and pour you a little glass of water.

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:42.880
Everybody's president, except one person that we vote for every four years to not be president.

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:49.040
And they get blamed for everything. They're like, all right, let's do this. Where are you building

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:54.960
that wall and paying for it? They're like, I'm not, I'm not president. You better do something.

01:43:54.960 --> 01:44:01.040
But nobody wants to be, nobody wants to be the not president because they have to pay all the

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:06.800
taxes for everything. They're like, shit, I don't want to be there. Should we do a scene from that

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:20.000
movie where Jeff is Benicio del Toro as the curtain? I'm the curtain. Yeah. And it's opposite world,

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:26.480
so you know how that goes. Right. Yeah. You're strung across the window and there's a big curtain

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:33.680
rod hanging in the middle of you. I will be Jean-Claude Van Damme, of course, as a roller skate

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:40.160
that is just, yeah, opposite roller skate. We can get into that later.

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:46.480
So I'm an opposite curtain. Yeah. Okay. You can make up your own version of it. I'm sorry.

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.920
No, no, I mean, I'm trying to wrap my Benicio del Toro brain around that.

01:44:49.920 --> 01:45:08.080
All right, all right. Rob will, of course, be Will Smith, I heard from the audience.

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:15.360
Two light skins, two light skins. Well, there's no such thing. I think you'll find is the moral of

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:23.280
this movie. Is that the voice where I might just opposite Dave Will Smith? No, you're Will Smith

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:45.680
and you're a candle. And Brandon is played by Rosie Perez. I'm just ready for anything. Rosie

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:59.200
Perez and your table. I'm tired of just sitting here. And it's opposite world. So all of those

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:10.560
rules are, they're not what you think. Okay. There's the Pixar logo is that lamp like stomping

01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:17.040
the eye or whatever that still happens. And then now we're coming through clouds. And then who are

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:30.080
you Dan? I'm a roller skate. And you played by played by Michael McDonald. I forgot. This is

01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:38.640
going to be terrible. What a what a wonderful day to be a rollerskate. I like to be a roller skate.

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:56.480
I like to roll around on my way to home. I am a roller skate wheel that has tiny roller skates

01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:03.440
for each of four wheels. You saw that coming. But it's dealt out piecemeal so that the audience

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:10.880
can start to understand this world's not normal. Here I go going home can't wait because it's

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:15.200
my birthday. I am Jean-Claude Van Damme. No, I'm not Jean-Claude. He wouldn't identify himself

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:23.760
that way. I am I am I'm roll I'm roller skate. He proceeds up his stairs to his house. Oh,

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:32.000
no, no, no, no, no. He goes down his stairs. Good point. To somebody else's house.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Time. Yeah. Time to go downstairs to someone else's house.

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:45.440
Lona. That's the opposite of that's the opposite of hiya.

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:50.160
God. Lona. Lona.

01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.640
Hello is me Roli.

01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:06.320
Hey, Roli. I'm just sitting at these people eating my lunch. Oh, opposite table. Yeah.

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:21.680
You like my shore shores? We guess whose birthday it isn't. What? You don't look at day under.

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:29.120
Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink. Oh, don't answer that.

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:42.480
The curtains. Oh, I'm outside the window. Somebody open the window so I can be inside.

01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:53.920
The curtains are outside the window because they're opposite. Lona. Whatever you do,

01:48:53.920 --> 01:49:06.160
don't let them in. I'll do that then because I'm your best enemy. Yes, I hate both of you guys.

01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:11.040
Oh, you do. I mean, and by guys, I mean, I hate one of you as a guy and one of you as a woman.

01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:17.200
No, no, no. I'm closing the window, which makes it open. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Curtin.

01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:23.920
Oh, I hate you so much. Oh, I hate you too. Hey, the phone's just starting to talk for no

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:31.760
reason, just without it even being off the handle. Let's just talk it. Hey, it's me. I'm the candle.

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:37.760
I live next door and I'm burning the wax at both ends here.

01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:44.160
So I'm just a flame in the middle and there's like wax on both sides of me.

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:50.480
If you notice, on the ground, I'm a curtain rod, but I go upwards.

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:53.840
That's great. I'm on the phone. I can't see any of that.

01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:57.040
Don't come over because we're not having a funeral.

01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:09.600
I want you to be louder because I can almost hear my television. So please be louder.

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:13.120
Don't come over. We would hate to see you.

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.680
I will. The phone hangs up and then it rings.

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:27.760
I just walked the fuck into the house.

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:33.840
The candle, that's like an opposite of a candle to just walk in the house.

01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:39.920
Well, I didn't wait till I leave and then you'll get it.

01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:44.080
Hey, you know what? The way you're behaving, if somebody should kill you,

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:52.480
you know, one of these days is going to be me for you. I'm a curtain.

01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:58.160
Oh, it'll be multiple me's for you. Curtains.

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:05.840
Well, I'm here again, as I always am, to pick up my mail that was delivered at your place.

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:15.200
I'm going to take these mails and leave. And after I leave,

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:21.040
I'm going to knock on the door and go, somebody stop this.

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:28.640
But then then we zoom in on the mail and then now it's now it's the mail spin off.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:34.960
Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Trader Joe's coupon booklet.

01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:43.360
How come you always, how come I'm always tucked inside of you, Trader Joe's coupon booklet?

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:50.000
Hey, let me tell you something. Do you know who I am? I'm jury ballot letter.

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:54.320
I'm the jury guy that tells you to be on the jury.

01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:56.320
Hey, I'm Trader Joe's coupon book.

01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.800
Yeah, I know, I'm stuffed inside you all the fucking time.

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:02.720
You two should stop fighting. Oh, no, no.

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:09.920
Listen to me. I am Xena, the Amazon Prime Princess.

01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:18.080
You guys are making me look so ugly. And all I do is stare at myself.

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:25.120
Tis I, Vanity Fair. Vanity Fair, I've been jerking off to you ever since that we were

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:31.280
putting that that mail sack. Me too. I've been jerking off to you since Thursday.

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:40.560
And it's Friday. Xena, Xena, I only, I only heard stories about you. I didn't think you

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:47.040
actually existed. Yeah, I do. Hey, did you know that cottage cheese is you get two for one now

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:58.320
at Trader Joe's? I did not. I did. Go, go, go, go, go. Hey, what gives with this mailbox?

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:06.880
Is it going with the rest of the property? This just an old mailbox. No one cares about

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:15.200
what's been delivered in it. Just rip it out, take it to the landfill tomorrow at six.

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:21.200
Oh Xena, Xena, this is our home for the next, maybe a day or so until the person comes up

01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:27.920
and brings us into the kitchen table. Hey, that's too bad. Old woman withers had a heart attack.

01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:34.800
So no one's going to ever get the mail inside this thing. You got a stamp on me.

01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:44.320
Sorry, right? You put a stamp on me. I don't want to cancel our fraternity.

01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:51.840
You had to lick it then stick it, but now we're going to be in a landfill.

01:53:53.600 --> 01:54:01.280
Mail story on Fox. Yeah, I like that opposite world has a self-contained non-opposite shitty

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:07.440
mail picture. It's kind of like the young ones where they would go to the refrigerator and talk

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:16.960
to the eggs. Remember that? I do. The eggs. Oh, we did it. We did it. We did 10 minutes of the

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:23.040
worst improv of anybody's life. I think that opposite thing was maybe a misguided. Maybe it

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:28.960
was the best idea. It's hard to be an opposite curtain. I was like, I had my brain kind of

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.880
frozen. I was wondering what you're going to do with that. I mean, I was outside, but then you

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:39.280
got to be... Who was your celebrity? The worst beneath Yieldal Toro. I ended up sounding more

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:52.240
like a strong bat from Homestar Runner. Do we want to guard your window from the sunlight?

01:54:52.240 --> 01:55:01.120
We shout not a charity? Okay, opposite man. What wasn't your question?

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:09.360
No, you're not. You are so not sorry. Well, it's opposite world. It means he's not sorry.

01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:13.600
What's your question? Oh, boy.

01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:17.120
I don't really understand. What's your favorite prank you've ever been given?

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:26.080
What's our favorite prank we've ever... That question. I don't know if Mike's

01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:30.240
picked it up, but his friend or maybe not. Maybe just a stranger was...

01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:33.440
I was going to say the wheel sound of that. The wheel sound of that.

01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:37.520
The wheel sound of that. I came in and I was like, uncontrollable derision.

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:42.880
I'm like, oh my God, I can't keep the mirth from...

01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:52.080
He just gave up halfway through it. He's like, what's the favorite prank that she... I don't know.

01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:01.360
Dan, you've been a victim of... What's your favorite prank or least favorite prank

01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:06.320
that you either have or haven't been either the victim of or have perpetrated on another person

01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:14.160
or yourself in opposite... Well, I really don't know what the question is,

01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:20.640
but I know my favorite prank show of all time was Alan Funtz Playboy Channel prank show,

01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:29.680
because it was so humanistic. None of the marks were ever... They were just poor people that had

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:34.640
clearly answered an ad that was like, your job is to come in and answer the phones in this like

01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:41.360
office and they never... They were just... They would come in and they were already...

01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:45.840
They were thinking like, oh, I'm going to make $5 an hour answering a phone,

01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:49.920
and then the voice on the other end is Alan Funtz, and then like a naked woman would come in or

01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:55.360
something. Just something like really an impossibly thin amount of variation on the idea of like a

01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:01.520
naked woman coming in and going like, I'm naked. Can I say that? And it was just basically like

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:08.560
just every man like answering the phone Alan Funtz would call and go, hey, what the fuck is going

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:13.920
on in there? What's going on? I just want... And then the poor person would just be like,

01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:21.760
I don't know. She's naked. I don't know. She's naked. What the fuck? What the fuck's going on over

01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:27.200
there? And it was like... Yeah, no, he said fuck every other word. I think it was like to make it

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:32.480
the Playboy Channel worthy. It was like, there was a... What the fuck is happening? And it was like

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:37.440
Alan Funtz's voice. And then after a while they'd go, hey, you're on naked, candid camera,

01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:41.120
and the person would go, great. And they'd give him more money than they thought they were going

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:45.840
to get. My favorite... I wasn't involved in this one, but our friend Drew Carey... On the Drew Carey

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:51.440
show, Drew had like wrapped a season. It was going to go on a vacation. And he had like an assistant

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:55.040
and they had his luggage backstage. And I think it was somebody in the prop department on the

01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:02.800
Drew Carey show at Warner Brothers, took an enormous like foot and a half long rubber dildo

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.240
and put a bunch of metal screws in it and then put it in his bag so it would set off the metal

01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:16.400
detector. So when he got through security, hey, I'm Drew Carey, how's it going? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:22.320
And then they, sir, and they pulled out this giant fucking dildo and apparently Drew, when he came

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:27.440
back, didn't talk to anybody in the set for a month. Speaking of pranks, though, I guess this

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:31.120
fits the category. We should have Eric Andre on the show. If you guys have been watching Eric Andre,

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:35.840
I bet. Like I just, I even know those are one of those shows like Adam Ruins, everything. I've

01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:39.520
never watched it. And then Mike McMahon one day at Rick and Morty's writer's room was like,

01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:44.240
have you seen Eric Andre? So when we started binging Eric Andre, I was like, holy shit,

01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:49.840
like really funny. But it'd be interesting to... I've chatted with him and stuff at like

01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:55.120
up fronts, like know who he is, but never, but hadn't, I think he would be interesting to talk to

01:58:55.120 --> 01:59:02.000
about the ins and outs of his show. Absolutely. I was a season two of punked. So I have 15 pranks

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:10.240
on various celebrities. I'm just going to say the time we made Usher, we made Usher write a jingle

01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:14.240
and told him that his brother had stolen women's clothing from a shop in Beverly Hills.

01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:18.160
And then we had to say to him, Mike, and this is how we want the jingle to go Usher.

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:22.560
He thought he was writing a jingle to get his brother out of

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:26.240
Hock with the place he had shoplifted at. We told him and his brother was there and his brother

01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:32.800
was like, I stole these clothes for these women that I'm trying to see. And I'm in trouble. And

01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:38.320
it was like a kitsyn or some shit. And we were like, well, you can get out of this if you write,

01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:42.640
if you sing this jingle for the store. And Usher was like, he looked at his brother and he goes,

01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:48.720
it's not sexy, man. What you're doing right now in the store stealing clothes is not sexy.

01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:58.160
As if they had had a discussion prior. Wow. I had one steal. It's not sexy. You gotta be like

01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:03.680
Usher. Your Usher's brother, you're supposed to go out there and be sexy. It's supposed to do sexy

02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:13.600
things. Right. So yeah, pranks. Did he write a jingle? He did not. He was like, I will just take

02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:20.800
the hit. I'll buy the shit. I'll buy the shit. My niece, Stephanie, when she was like maybe five,

02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:28.480
I was, I don't know, eight. She was staying in the guest room in our house. I went and got under

02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:35.360
her bed like an hour before she went to bed. So I was in there. Oh no. This isn't a prank though.

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:42.720
And I tilted the mirror like on the wardrobe kind of thing. So I held her. You? I was probably

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:49.120
last year. No, no, no. 32. I would say I was like nine years old. Okay. I was actually picturing,

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:53.920
the reason I said oh no is because I was picturing you like 30. No, no, no, no. Okay. No, no,

02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:58.240
no. She's only a couple years younger than I. So like, she might have been five. I was seven, six,

02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:04.080
eight, something like that. And I tilted the mirror on the chest of drawers so I could kind of see

02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:10.720
up towards the bed and was in there for an hour and it was uncomfortable and it's cramped. And

02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:18.000
I used to fuck with her all the time. And she came in and got to bed and I waited another hour.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:23.520
And there was enough light to the window and she had a night light so I could see

02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:27.200
that she was there. And I waited until she was like settled in bed because she was like,

02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:30.480
you know, doing a thing and reading a book or playing with my little pony or whatever.

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:36.240
And then I waited until she was like just about falling asleep. And I was there for two hours.

02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:51.840
And I went, oh, she leapt 15 feet off the bed, turned the lights on, and I got out of the bed.

02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:59.680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That was more terrorizing than it ought to have been.

02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:09.280
That's fucked up. Well, my brother, I remember he wanted to scare my grandma

02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:17.040
and he hid down in the basement. So it's starting off with a good idea. For a really long time,

02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:22.080
this is my grandma Bunny. She recently passed away, my mom's mom. Is this the one, the stabba dude?

02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:31.200
No, no, no, no. That's her mom. That's grandma Bhusha. But grandma Bunny, I guess my brother

02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:36.800
hid down in the basement because he wanted to scare grandma. And she came down and she was

02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.480
doing laundry and he was just hiding and he was kind of biting his time. And then she let the

02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:48.640
biggest fart out. And then he started freaking out, laughing and crying and stuff. And I thought

02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:54.560
there was a delightful story because she was a little scared, but it was funnier that whatever

02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:59.360
he was going to do was more, it's like don't scare an old lady, but it's nicer that she was like,

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:05.440
she was like... And then he was like... And I was like, yeah, why are you putting all this

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:16.640
energy into... The hunter has become the hunter. Cliff Hanger. Thank you all. We love you. Thank

02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:23.680
you for coming down to Dynasty Typewriter. Give it up for Brandon Johnson. Go to sleep. Everybody

02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:31.040
go to sleep. Rob Schrab. The body needs sleep. Also, I wasn't here. Let's give a big round of

02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:34.880
applause for our dearly departed friend, Brody Stevens. I love him and we miss him dearly.

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:40.320
The world is not the same but not him. Also our friend, Sam Christensen. We love you.

02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:47.120
You're still here with us. I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis. Your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:11.700
you

02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:41.200
you
