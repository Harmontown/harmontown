02:41.000\nSlowly, my eyes will move to the front of my head.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:46.000\nSo I can have depth perception.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nAnd I'll get color vision.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:52.000\nSo I can recognize ripe fruit.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:54.000\nOh, damn.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nDamn.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nMy tail's going away.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nI'm

04:22.000\nWelcome back to me.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:27.000\nWelcome back to you.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nWe're kind of playing with the show format here.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nI didn't want

certainly, if he's going through anything,\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nit's not affecting his work.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:52.000\nI've seen four animatics of Harmon Quest.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:53.000\nVery good season.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:55.000\nProbably best season ever.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:59.000\nLooking forward to that.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:05.000\nMaybe he's content to just focus on that.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:06.000\nAnd I'm here.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nYeah.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nWho needs Spencer?\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:11.000\nWho needs anybody?\n\n05:11.000 -->

working.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nAnd so I'm a little out of it.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nWhat are you working on?\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:28.000\nScreenplay that was due a million years ago.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:31.000\nAnd just finishing it up.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nJust about finished.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:36.000\nThis is for Aquaman 3, right?\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nIt's in that area.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:47.000\nDr. Stranger.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.000\nWho knows?\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nWho's strange?\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nI was thinking about Green Arrow today.\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:02.000\nDr. Stranger.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:07.000\nIs he called Green Arrow because he's new at it?\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:10.000\nGreen Arrow.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:15.000\nWell, I'm not the best Arrow guy here.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nI'm still new.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nI'm a little...\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nYou're going to need to get your uniform\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nbefore you start talking to management.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nYou knew Green Arrow.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nIt may be a different Arrow,\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nbut you knew Green Arrow.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nGreen Lantern?\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nI thought you were on my side.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:36.000\nJust because we Green don't mean we are Green.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nGreen Arrow and...\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nIs this helping?\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nGreen Arrow and Green Lantern,\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nthey were partnered up in a series of comic books\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nthat were critically acclaimed.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nI can't imagine why.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nMaybe it was because people liked watching the Green Lantern\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nfeel awkward.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nIt's like, dude, you just...\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nWhat is your origin story?\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nYou played Peter Pan in high school\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nand hit your head?\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nHe just shoots dumb Arrows.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nThat's all he does.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nPerhaps my boxing glove Arrow\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nwill punch this up a bit.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.000\nPerhaps my screwdriver Arrow\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nwill turn things around.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nOkay, none of that works.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nPerhaps my exploding Arrow will blow you up.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nJust use your exploding Arrow\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nevery time, Green Arrow.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nDon't waste your time making\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nall these Arrows.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nWhat do you do?\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nJust budget your time.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nYou're not getting them back.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nYeah, I mean, just once you...\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nYou're not getting them back.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nYou gotta shoot them.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nWhat's he gonna do?\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nHe's like, hey, guys, wait a second.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nBefore you jump into the car\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nand drive back, I gotta go pick up my fucking Arrows.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nOtherwise, I'm not equipped.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nI'm not a comic book guy.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nDoes he conjure them up\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nor does he actually fabricate them\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nfor the purpose?\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nHe tinkers.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nHe's like part tinkerer, part archer.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nHe makes his Arrows\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nin a workshop.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nIs anybody a Green Arrow\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\naficionado that...\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nRight, so he is, right?\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nIs he a meta-human?\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nOh, really? See, that's kind of interesting\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nbecause how many other non-meta-humans\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nare there?\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nAt least, two.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nSo, does he have a Green Arrow car?\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nYes.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nWhat is it called?\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nIt's like the Arrow Mobile or something.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nWe had...\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nThe Rick and Morty staff were kind of\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nvery delicately vandalizing\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nthe Green Arrow Wikipedia one season.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.000\nThey kept adding, like,\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nreally...\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nWe're trying to see how long can the shit\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\njust seep into canon\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nbecause you really don't know.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nThe shit gets ridiculous\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nbecause, like, Green Arrow's been around forever.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nThere was a run of Green Arrow\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nwhere his sidekick Speedy had a heroin addiction.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nYou wouldn't be able\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nto tell, like, at a glance...\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nWhy did Speedy have a heroin addiction?\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nYeah.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nHe would have, like, a meth addiction.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nYeah.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nThat's meta.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nBut there was this whole thing.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nWe went too far at one point\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nand we got busted.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nDid they come to your house and go,\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nhey, you know,\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nsome Green Arrow fan, like,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nexpunged the whole thing.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nIt was slowly building.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nThere was this whole thing about\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nthis really meticulous grievance between\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nGreen Arrow and someone else.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nAnd part of it was he thought\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nthat it started\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nwith the Green Arrow Mobile\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nand how he thought that this person\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nhad scratched it\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nand wouldn't admit it.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nAnd then that was, like,\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nthreaded into, like, different,\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nlike, infinite crisis\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nand whatever, and kind of, like,\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nthis, like, long-standing grudge\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nwith this other DC character\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nthat he was convinced had scratched his car.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nYeah.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nI mean, essentially, Dan,\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nyou're telling me a story about something\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nthat was funny once.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nIt's not really gonna be funny again.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nI understand.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nI haven't slept in a while.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nYou've been doing some\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nDC research.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nDC research.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nI'm trying to\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nto remind him to push him together.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nOkay, so Green...\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nYeah, I learned all about Red Tornado today.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nDC search.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nSo Green Lantern's weakness\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nis anything made of yellow?\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nIs that purple?\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nWell, it goes through\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\ndifferent things, like the...\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nLike yield signs?\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nLike wood?

Kryptonite\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nif the police tell him\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nto get down on his knees\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nand put his hands behind his head\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nhe technically has to\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nunless he wants to be a criminal that day\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nhe's privileged\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nin the sense that the cops probably won't say it\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nbut he probably won't kill him\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nso those are fun stories\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nwhere it's like oh Superman\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nhe's a criminal because he's questioning\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nthis congressman or whatever\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nit seems to me like that's the way to go\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\ndo you ever read J.J. Abrams\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nSuperman script fly by\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:34.000\ndo you ever read him\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nhe didn't use\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nKryptonite either what he did was\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nhe said\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nSuperman didn't need Kryptonite because\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nhe was raised\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nby humans and his mother\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nhe's adopted mother and father\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nwe're saying\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\ndon't run as fast as you can\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\ndon't show people how strong you really are\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nalways do less than what\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\ndon't reach your potential because\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nif you ever do they'll take you away from us\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:04.000\nor they'll dissect you\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nor you'll be a monster\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nwhich is growing up in the Midwest\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nyeah exactly\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nbut that was very interesting\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nhow do you supplement your powers\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nit was about a Superman\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nwho was like I don't know\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nhow fast I really can go\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nI might be able to go\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nas fast as faster than anything\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\never I might be able to lift\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nanything\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nhe has no idea\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nso that I thought was very interesting\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nyeah also psychologically if you had an inborn\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nlet's say you had an inborn sense of\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nmorality all those dangerous concepts\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nlike the idea of like\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nthat came from a different species\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nand let's say somehow that species through\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\neither genetic or mimetic evolution\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nhad kind of like a benchmark\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nmorality to them where\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nyou start from\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\na baseline of like\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nyeah don't be a piece of shit\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nand then you're transplanted to\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\na savage planet\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nwhere you're then raised by parents\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nwho are telling you yeah you're special\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nbut be careful\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\ndon't flash those powers\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nthey'll take you away so\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nyou're motivated by not being taken away\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nand then on top of that you're also being reinforced\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nthe whole time with this\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nyou'll feel\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nyou'll never be tempted unlike a sort of wish fulfillment\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nthing where you're like\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nwell wait a minute\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nif I did\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nuse these powers and stopped giving a shit\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nwhat everyone else thinks\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nI could be rich\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nor I could be successful\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nbut then there's a loop there possibly\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nwith Superman where he doesn't want\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nto be rich\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nor a rock star or successful\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nhe only wants the one thing\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nwhich is actually quite difficult for him to achieve\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nwhich is a sense of belonging\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nhe doesn't because he knows he's essentially\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\ndeformed\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nhe's like he can't if he's not\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\ncareful he could karate chop your head off\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nwhile he's like passing the\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nsalt\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nand so he's like embarrassed\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nabout that is even though we would go\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nthere's nothing to be embarrassed about because\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nyou should just use that to either rob banks\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nor stop people from robbing banks\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nsee I would love to see that as him at high school\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nand he says can you\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\ncan you eat those Doritos and accidentally knock\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nsomebody's heads off and then\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nthen he just like moves away\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nI guess I gotta go to a different\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nhigh school again\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nbecause I can't explain what's going on\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nI'm just like hey how you doing\n\n30:28.000 -->

helping?\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nI like that his powers make him a loser\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nnot super\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nit's kind of an interesting take\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nhe's the opposite of Kung Fu\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nhe just kills people by accident\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nby accident and has to leave town\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nevery

31:16.000\nyeah you were there when I did it\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nwell I forgot your results okay\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\nI don't think that was a fair test\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nI thought you answered the questions very\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\naccurately but I didn't think\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nthat the results kind of\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nencapsulated you\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nit felt like I was affected by everybody at the table\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nyou know\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nI was sitting there very passively\n\n31:34.000

guys\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nwhen you conducted the test\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nBeelman's bar\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nand Dan you want to explain\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nwhat we're talking about to everybody else\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nin the room\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nis it Briggs Meyer or Meyer's Briggs\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nI think all the kids know about it now\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nI think they kind of like\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:00.000\nsome people\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nthey'll put their\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nsignifiers\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\non their dating profile\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nwhich\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nI thought about that and I was like\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nyeah I thought I went through\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\na cycle I was like well I would love to know\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nyours\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nbefore a blind date with you because\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nnot to like\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nstack the deck but to actually\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\njust be like\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nyou know\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.000\nyou could actually\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nthe equivalent of like\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\na failed first date could be\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nactually created by\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nreading for 20 minutes like\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nkind of like oh this is a different personality\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nthis person actually blah blah blah\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nand that maybe then\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nbut if you were and if you were down with that\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nthen you could show up to the first date\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nmore prepared to have it not be\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\na disaster because you'd be like\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nwell I already know that this person\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nis such a thing as a person in the world\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nthat believe it or not isn't that interested\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nin this or that or whatever\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nbut then I thought about it more and I was like\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nI don't think I want\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nI think there's too many dishonest people in the world\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nso like\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nwho wants\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nI think what's most valuable is maybe\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\ndoing your own thing and knowing who you are\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nbut then putting it out on a satellite\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\ndish for other people\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nit's like\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nit's just like\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nit\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nalso there's like crazy people that would like\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\ntake the test and they'd go\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nI'm a thing of a bob\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nand then they'd be so into it that\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nthey would like fuck those people\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nDan did you\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nyou

33:54.000\nI think it's like I\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\nN\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nTP\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nwhat is that\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nintrovert\n\n34:02.000 -->

--> 34:28.000\nand I looked at it a little bit and I was busy at the time\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nand I was like it sounds like me but whatever\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nso the horoscopes went

remember that so vividly\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nbut it turns out the reason I do is because\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nshe also took it years ago\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nand got that same

36:08.000\na little bit more because they don't know how to handle\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\ntheir actual feelings\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nbecause they\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nactually do believe\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nand practice\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nthe idea that there is such a thing as truth\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nand that truth is more important\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nthan\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\neverything else\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nbut also like very\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nI was happy to see\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nI've always felt that way about myself\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nthat\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nin spite of this very meritocracy\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nkind of mind\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nwhich now we've come to associate\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nwith the sort of creepy archetype\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nonline\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nyou just don't even want to hear that word right

don't care about hierarchy\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nyou really would prefer\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nthings to be on a flat plane\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nand\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nso that you could just be\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nextraordinary at your own thing\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nand everybody else could too\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nthat the truth\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nwould out and everybody would\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nimprove themselves and stuff\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nand then along the way\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nthings\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nthe downsides that are typical\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nare like okay this is not a person\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nthat is always thinking about your feelings\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nwhen they're talking\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nbecause they're trying to get their thoughts straight\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nthey're very comfortable\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\ngoing off half cocked\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nthey'll figure it out as they're talking\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:34.000\nand\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nthey love explaining\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nand they want to create\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\na system and stuff\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:42.000\nand they believe the universe is a system\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:44.000\nand there's something to figure out\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nand then creatively for that reason\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nendless revisions\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nand never ending\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nnot finishing of projects\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nand stuff which was kind of a\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nbummer I mean how do you feel when you\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\njust in general\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nwhen you the idea of like\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\noh there's 16 personalities here's yours\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nI think the effect on me was\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nsort of like a simultaneous\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nkick in the nuts\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nand lifting\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nup\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nso not contradictory just kick to the nuts so hard\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\nthat you're lifted up\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\na teeter totter\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nthe\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nbecause it's like\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\non one hand you are what you are\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nand it's kind of\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nbecause I think everybody wants to be special\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nfor the purpose of\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\ncontributing everybody wants to be special\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\nso that they can fit in\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nisn't that crazy people really do want a job\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nwhat about\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nwhat about Wonder Woman\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nwhatever\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nI did forget her\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nthat's so spiteful that everybody laughed\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nat him saying Wonder Woman so much more\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nthan her back there they were just like\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nWonder Woman\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nlet that be a lesson\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\npick your moment\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:06.000\nthat's the funny way of doing it\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nright\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:10.000\nstand up and walk up to the stage\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nbut it is an interesting concept\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nthat you get the woody\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nfrom Toy Story kind of thing\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nof that idea of finding out that\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nyou're unremarkable\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nin a certain sense that there are others of you\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:24.000\nthat you're a category\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.000\ndon't look at me man\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:28.000\nit can be\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nthat's what the internet has\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\ngiven us is the idea of no matter how fringe\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\nyou are there's always going to be at least\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:36.000\n500 other people out there somewhere\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:38.000\nyou don't have to get in a plane to find them\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\nthat's uplifting always\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\noh who else here\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nI just watched the Flat Earth documentary\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\nhave you guys watched it\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:50.000\nI started watching it but I didn't get it all the way through\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nit's a little less heartbreaking and shitty\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nthan you might think it is\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nbecause I know you know that basically\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nprobably all Flat Earthers\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nI remember on this podcast I would always be like\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nFlat Earthers are basically heroes right\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nbecause how could you commit\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nand then like everything else\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nthe election changed everything because it was just sort of like\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\noh this is\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\njust another expression of\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nanti-intellectual revolution\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nand like I'm not charmed by it anymore\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nbut\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nit's worth watching it's a charming documentary\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nthey\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nand there's some uplifting\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:26.000\nparts to it too that do feel like\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nactually actionable items\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nespecially\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nfor people who\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\nlook\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nthe scientific community kind of like\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:38.000\nthe idea that maybe it's\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:40.000\nit's important to\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nthat it's not\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nscientific to\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nridicule people\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nit accomplishes nothing\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nif your scientific goal is for people to value science\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nand you know that you live in a world\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nwhere for whatever reason\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nthere are people who are pushed so far away\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nthat they're in a dark dirty corner\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nmaking up their own science\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:02.000\nand you gotta know scientifically\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.000\nthat you're never gonna bring them back\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nby laughing at them\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nnot that they're not funny\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nbut if that's your goal\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nif it's your goal to bring them back\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:14.000\nthen you gotta know as a scientist\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\nthat\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\nthe way to bring them back is you're gonna have to\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\ngo way more than\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nwhat's fair in their direction\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nlike they're not gonna meet you halfway\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nas one of them\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nthere's a guy that's interviewed in it\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nand\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nhe's a physicist at Caltech\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:34.000\nand I recognized him because I was on a panel with him\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nRick and Morty\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nkind of science panel\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nscience panel?\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nI know, yeah\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nand he had such a cool\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nso many cool things to say\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\na lot of the scientists in the documentary\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nit's like there's this evolution that's being forced\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:52.000\nupon us where it's like\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:54.000\nhey man\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.000\nokay so\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:58.000\nnow we've got this other danger\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:00.000\nthere's gonna be people that are gonna be so\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nlike revenge of the nerds\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:04.000\nhappened, it's over\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nthe nerds are in control\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.000\nnow there's\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nlike\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:12.000\npeople\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:14.000\ngathering in little clusters\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nwho are\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nsuffering from\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:20.000\nconfirmation bias and\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nwhatever it's called Kepler Allen\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:24.000\nperson's project disorder\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.000\nDunning Kruger\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nand the documentary does a really good\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nhumanizing job\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nof illustrating that absolutely perfectly\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:40.000\nshowing their little meats\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:42.000\nand editing it in such ways\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:44.000\nwhere\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:46.000\neverything kind of becomes really\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nclear and humanizes everybody\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nand\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nthere's scientific communities where\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.000\nit's like the woke version of being a scientist\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nnow\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nis like they're\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:00.000\nis\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:02.000\ntalking to each other\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nscientists that are qualified that know\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\neverything talking to each other and saying\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nwhat are we gonna do about these guys\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nthey're not going away\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nthey're not enchanted by us\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nthey're\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nwaiting for everyone to get so\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\ninto fucking\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nlogic that they\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nflock to us\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nI love like on Twitter\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:26.000\nProfessor Brian Cox\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nhe'll engage with some flat\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nearthers once in a while and it's hilarious\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nbecause he just shows them images\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nand shows them like\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nand gives them a reason but\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\nthey only see that reason and that logic\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nas proof\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:42.000\nthat there's something to fight against\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nthere's a really great sequence in this documentary\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nwhere they\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\none of the more scientifically\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nminded people is explaining\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nthe difference between\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nthis\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\npoint A to point B\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nscientific process where\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nas much as none of us\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:02.000\nwant to be wrong if you're a true scientist\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nyou're like if I'm wrong\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nI'm wrong and kind of moving forward\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:08.000\nto whatever conclusion is actually there\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nand then him\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nbreaking down the very common\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nreverse of that process where\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nyou've decided what your conclusion\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nis and how you kind of weed\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nthings out and backwards paint this arrow\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nfrom B to A\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nand while he's explaining that\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nyou're\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\nthey're editing it with a conversation\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nwith a wonderful charming\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.000\nhuman guy that\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.000\nI don't want to see suffer\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.000\nit was explaining that\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nhe they're so into\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:40.000\nflat earth that they bought\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\na $20,000 gyroscope\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nthey raised the money because\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nthey knew that if\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nthe earth\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nreally was round that\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nyou should be able to get a gyroscope\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nthat would register a 15 degree per hour\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nshift\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nin the tilt or whatever and they just\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nthose things are really expensive so they raised the money\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nand they get this $20,000 gyroscope\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nin the mail and they open it up\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nand as soon as they open it up they turn it on\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nand it's registering a 15 degree\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nan hour shift and then they start\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nputting it in different containers made of\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\ndifferent things to shield it from the\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nglass dome above us\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:18.000\nbecause they're and so he's\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nexplaining that process\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nwhich is an adventure to him an adventure\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.000\nthat starts with like a I know\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nwhat windmill is what\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nand\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.000\nit but the\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nthey're editing it back and forth of someone explaining this\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nis how this works like you\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:36.000\nthat the earth is flat so now\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\ngetting this gyroscope is just\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nit's like the Joker escaping\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nfrom Arkham it's like a job to do you've got to\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nfigure out how to\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\ndefeat him and\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nand so they're trying to figure out and that\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nreminds them of experimentation\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nand science and because it looks\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nthe same thing but what\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nyou're doing is\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nlike that guy is like\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nhe's at these\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nmeetups and they're like\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\nhe's having these like private conversations\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nover in the corner of the bonfire\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nparty and he's kind of explaining to somebody like\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nyeah it's\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nI'm not going to bring up\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nthe gyroscope this year at the Flat Earth\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nCon it's a big\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nkind of a bug bear\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nyeah\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nwe're going to do some more experiments\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\nI brought it up before I won't repeat\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nit but like I had a lift driver and he\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nwas a Flat Earther and\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nI asked him 20 questions he gave me\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\n20 answers that he had\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nready to go\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nwe're all of them\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nnumber one here's the number one\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nthe top five\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nstarting with number 20 going\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nto number one\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nnumber 20 coming in\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nwe've done this before but like\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nnot all 20 of them here we go\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\n20 questions and answers\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nabout Flat Earth\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:56.000\nhe was an intelligent guy but I was like\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nyou're using navigation\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nright now on your phone\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nto get me from\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nmeltdown to the drawing\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nthat's green\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nhe had it\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nnumber 19\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\none of the more fascinating things is of course\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nis you might expect the division\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nlike you have those solidarity but then\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nthe divisions\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nthe infinite plain people\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\nfrom the pheasant under glass people\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:26.000\nI don't know how they differentiate but like\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\num\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nthere's like\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nas soon as you become a prominent Flat Earther\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nyou have a podcast that like people follow\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nnow you're a dispenser of information\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nwhich by virtue of the same kind of oppositional defiant\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\nlike engine that's powering\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nthe religion of the group\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nand I would say\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:46.000\nif you're a woman and if you're\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\nreasonably attractive\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:50.000\nlike this one woman is and this thing\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nlike she's\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nshe's easy on the eyes and she has\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nlike a Skype podcast with this other guy\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:58.000\nwho's like\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nwho literally lives in his mom's basement\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nand you really like hate these people\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nyou're just sort of like oh you guys are cute\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nand um and they're because they're\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\ngood natured I mean they just happen to think\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nthe earth is flat and they're truly dedicated to it\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nbut like the crazy thing is like then the\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nthe brief dip they take\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\ninto the dark forest of\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nokay here's what it's like to be a woman\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\nand be a Flat Earther\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nbecause immediately\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nthe last three letters of her first name\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nare CIA because she's Patricia\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nso I mean that's\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\njust asking for it\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nher last name is steer so she's clearly\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\na honeypot that's been sent to seduce\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nFlat Earthers and steer them the wrong\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nway toward the NASA\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\ngoverned thing like everybody's a robot\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nand everybody's what's the first\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\nday of conspiracy\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nfactory\n\n48:46.000 -->

do I'm thinking\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nsteer because you're gonna be like why\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nwould you do that's always the\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nthat's such an important linchpin to\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:02.000\nconspiracy theory universe is that the\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nIlluminati love bragging\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nbecause if they didn't love bragging\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nso much of this shit wouldn't make sense at the end\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nof the day you're like why would they put\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nthe ghost in Tom Selleck's living room in\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nthree men and a baby because they're trying\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nto tell us they want us to\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nknow\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nwhy would they let\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nthis copy of Back to the Future get out\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nif it's crawling with 9-11 predictions\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nthis movie is crawling\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nbecause the whole point is to do\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\n9-11 right in front of you\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nit makes the 9 and the 11\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\nso delicious that you knew about it\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nit's like when you soak a tortilla chip in the salsa\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nif I'm repeating a thing\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nfrom previous podcast and fuck it but\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nRob I told the driver I go okay\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nbecause I said but why\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\ndo we see eclipses as a circle on the moon\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nlike because we're all just it's just\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nflat discs that are casting shadows and\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nthings but like every time\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nlike like like why is it a curve\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nand this and he had an answer of\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\na bullshit answer but he had an answer\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nand I said let's say you and\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nI stood a hundred miles\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\napart on the equator and walked\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\ndue north\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nI'm saying\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nthat at one point you and I would meet each other\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nbecause we live on a sphere\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nand he goes no\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nwe would keep walking straight I go and then\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nwhat would happen at the end he goes I said\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nwould we fall off and he goes no because\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nthere's a ridge at the end and you can't fall off\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nit's ice it's a wall of ice\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:26.000\nyeah that's that's dumb\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:28.000\nand I said\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:30.000\nI said oh you're a moron\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nand I laugh he goes I said no I'm sorry\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nyou're not a moron I go I go but\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nseriously what do you think what happened\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nhe goes I said I'm gonna fly you and\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nme we're gonna be a hundred\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nmiles apart on the equator and walk north\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nhe goes if you pay for it I'll do it\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nthat's how they get you that's how they\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nget you and now he's in Barbados\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nhaving a fucking time of his life what would\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nit take for you to believe in the\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\nround earth\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nchicken margarita\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nif you like peanut\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nI guess you're right man let's do it again\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nnext summer\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nsome of these guys thanks for the hotel\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nsome of them\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nyou bought me a hotel like the gyroscope guy\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:10.000\nand then they have another experiment that they\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:12.000\nwant that they're doing in it throughout the movie\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nwhere they're like look we're so convinced\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:16.000\nthey and they come up with a scientific\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:18.000\nidea we're gonna take three\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nbeams\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nwe're gonna put them they found\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\na place where okay we got 3.8 miles\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nof space\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nto play with here we're gonna put three beams\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nequidistant from each other\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nalong this 3.8 mile stretch\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\n3.8 miles\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nwill\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nequate to a certain amount of if the\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\ncurvature\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nwithin that within that certain degree of curve\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nand so\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:46.000\nbut they're gonna prove that that curvature doesn't\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.000\nexist by taking a laser\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\nand shining it through\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nyou know three holes\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\non these things and if the middle\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nmiddle one\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nis going through\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:00.000\nthe earth ain't flat and so\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nand then they cut to like a scientist\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nlike hearing about that they just describe\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nthe thing and he's like okay well\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nokay\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nalright yeah they're fucked\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nlike he's kind of like yeah no actually\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nI\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nit sounds like they're\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nin trouble\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nthat's a real experiment that you can do they're going to\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nprove that the earth is round accidentally\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nand they're gonna be bummed out\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nand yeah and I won't spoil it but\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nbut\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nbut it is kind of interesting\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nspoilers the earth is round\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nit's kind of like it's kind of like not\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:36.000\nentirely\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nthere's like so many different camps and like\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\neven just sort of culturally and that\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nit's not as much as I thought it would be\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nwhere it's just like\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nI'm gonna sharpen my buoy knife\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nand blame the Jews for everything\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nand it makes me feel empowered\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nto do the\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nscientific equivalent of saying\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nI don't know that\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nyou know that I didn't do you

53:06.000\nthey're like they're out there\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\ndoing these Boy Scout experiments\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\nso they're gonna but the only thing\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nabout it is that they're not gonna take\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nno for an answer they're gonna because\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nand there's a very interesting\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nanalysis of that concept too\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nlike where it's like what would you actually do\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nif it was these guys they have they\n\n53:22.000 -->

to\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nend like this and there's all of these\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nhe's explaining everything and I'm explaining\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000\neverything and and so everyone's like\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nwhat are you a valley girl why does the sentence have to go\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000\nlike people are really and I was like\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000\nI was like listening to these things and I\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nwas cringing on his behalf\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nbut and then atoning\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nwith that that cosmic force\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nbecause I was like boy I\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000\nsure hope\n\n01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000\nthat this\n\n01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000\ndoesn't\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000\naffect him\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nand I think these\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000\nbecause\n\n01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nwhat good would that do\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nI mean\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000\noutside of like if he was like oh I should take the Jolly Rancher\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nout and I think you can hear him like\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nI think you can hear him start to like try to\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nforce himself to like I think he is\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nlike we were Cody and I were analyzing and going\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nI think he is seeing some of this stuff and it is\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nmaybe\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nhurting him or not but in any case he's like\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000\nadjusting and\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nbut but the most important thing like\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nlike\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000\noh god what like\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nI don't know it's just like fresh eyes on this\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nconcept of like people have like\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000\ntalking about him because he's a product\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nhe's put himself out there\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nhe has 13 listeners\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nhe has 13\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000\npatreons\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000\npatreons\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nand so he's like\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nhe's not worth\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000\ntaking down\n\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000\nbut people are drifting through\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000\nand they're like they got a lot to say\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nsome people\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000\nhave a lot to say about how deep and thoughtful he is\n\n01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nsome people\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000\nreally go for the jugular about\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nhis very on the cuff\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nflaws\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nand\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nit was just sort of an educational process for me to go\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000\noh well\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nokay I hear all that\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nI can laugh at all that I can\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nthey observe the same thing they're observing but\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000\ngod what a tragedy it would be\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nif he let any of this\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000\nlike fuck up his day\n\n01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nI don't know\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nI don't think I'm able to articulate my point\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nthere's just sort of like\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nthen putting myself back in the\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000\nposition where it's like wait a minute\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nyou're a fucking dude\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nlike putting this thing out it's a product\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nyou're a build-a-bear\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nyou're a character you're a thing\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.360\ntalk about you and they don't want, none of them would want you to ever be like,\n\n01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:54.960\noh well that's gonna make me change everything about my life or I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill myself\n\n01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:59.760\nnow or I'm gonna stop doing this or start doing that because they would be like, whoa, whoa,\n\n01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.960\nwhoa, what part of me listening didn't you understand? I'm just like, the internet is where\n\n01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:09.760\nyou can just type about this stuff. I'm just a couple of ear holes like sucking your shit in\n\n01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.240\nand I got nothing to say so I may as well say about this. Like, I didn't want you to fucking have\n\n01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:20.640\nan opinion about the human species because, because of this stuff, but I can't figure out,\n\n01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:24.480\nyou know, at what point you're supposed to- It's a weird motivation. I just don't know,\n\n01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.320\nlike, because I was like, I don't think anybody wants you in the subreddit really, like, because\n\n01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.800\nas much as they'd be excited that you were there, in the long term they'd be like,\n\n01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:40.880\nwhat am I supposed to, like, police myself and talking about, oh I hate it when he talks about\n\n01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.600\nthis or when he does that. A little bit. Maybe they should, but. A little bit. A little bit,\n\n01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:56.400\nbecause we really are doing the best that we can. And we make a product, and sometimes we dip in\n\n01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.480\nthere to see how the product's getting received because we want to make sure that you like the\n\n01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:04.880\nshit we like. But if people wanted to have to worry about that, they'd go to their own Thanksgiving\n\n01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:10.400\ndinners. Like, oh, Uncle Bob heard you talking about the Packers and now he's throwing a shit\n\n01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.440\nfit in the kitchen and it's like, that's the thing that people are getting away from when they\n\n01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.400\nconsume other people. Strangers. They just go, oh, and they, and they actually, if anything, they\n\n01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:24.080\nlike to, like, I think they, you know, you pour more into it in terms of like love and hate and\n\n01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.960\nlike judgment and opinions and stuff. It's like actually a reflection of how far, how hard you're\n\n01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:36.400\ntrying to get away from the mess that is your own life. They're just like, oh, I hate Becky on the\n\n01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.640\nhome shopping channel when she honks that horn. Like, you're just, you're engaging in consumption.\n\n01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.920\nIf you keep it at that level, when you start to make it personal, though, it's certainly something\n\n01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:52.160\nthat you need to question your motivation. Because like, when I open my mouth to speak,\n\n01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:57.200\nI'm trying to make people laugh or do something decent versus like somebody who thinks that\n\n01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:02.320\nthey're crafting some incredible shit talk. That's a whole different beast at which points\n\n01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.400\nyou're sort of calling yourself out. So there's a, there's a point that you made that I agree with,\n\n01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:11.200\nwhich is like, you're, you're trying to run away from your own shitty life by talking shit. And I,\n\n01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.680\nI definitely think people should be allowed to talk shit. But when it gets personal, you got to\n\n01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:22.560\nask yourself, am I, do I, am I negating that this person has experiences that they've been through\n\n01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:30.160\nthat my comments might actually trigger? Like, I don't want to shit on, I'm not necessarily a David\n\n01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:35.120\nHasselhoff fan, but I'm not going to be like, David Hasselhoff's album, I'm not going to make an\n\n01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:41.600\naccount and a fake name just so I can get on a Yahoo chat board and go, David, David Hasselhoff\n\n01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:47.440\nsucks. And here's the 15 reasons why. Like at that point, David Hasselhoff maybe needs to call you\n\n01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:53.200\nup and say you outside because I'm outside. At that point, because there, there is this part\n\n01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:58.000\nwhere I'm like, if you're so creative with your words, why the fuck would you choose to put me\n\n01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.320\ndown? That's like, I travel a lot and I go and yelp all the time just to find a place to eat, like\n\n01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.120\nfind some vegetarian food or find the bar or find like a place like that's got this or that,\n\n01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:13.680\nwhatever, I'm craving Italian food or whatever. And I go and yelp places that I know that I like,\n\n01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:18.880\nlike, you know, like I've always, I always go to this place in Seattle and I always go to that,\n\n01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:25.600\nthese two places in Portland and awesomely they have bad reviews because like that means the\n\n01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:30.000\nassholes aren't going there. Like you read the bad reviews and it was some douchebag that had a bad\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.760\ndate and like, like he won't be there. But like, I know that I can have fun in that place because\n\n01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:41.680\nlike I don't want to see like 7,000 five star reviews on a place because that means everybody's\n\n01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:50.560\nthere. Like, like, so like, sometimes the negativity helps you like, yeah, filter out the tritus.\n\n01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:57.040\nYeah, I do think anonymity is like key to our species problem as we join as we move from\n\n01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:04.560\nreal to digital. Like that is just absolutely the key is this concept of anonymity. Because we're,\n\n01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:12.560\nwe are, I have had my career affected by anonymous people. That is something that we were supposed\n\n01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:17.600\nto reserve for black and white photographs in certain sections of history books that because\n\n01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:25.040\nthat is a brick through a window. You know, like a the reason why Facebook kind of heralded the mass\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.880\nmigration of our parents to the internet was because what they perceived there was something\n\n01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:36.080\ndifferent from my space, which was, Oh, so I know who I am. And I know who my uncle is. And if I'm\n\n01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:44.320\nplaying Farmville, I can there is there this idea that we could actually just move what we're accustomed\n\n01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:50.720\nto over onto a digital platform. And then it's like, it's as if we're in the right now, we're in the\n\n01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:56.720\nworst of both worlds. Because we're, we're just in this process of spending all of our time online.\n\n01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:06.640\nBut we, we were online is currently a place that it the ratio of anonymity to importance\n\n01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:12.800\nis really something that unlike any culture we've ever experienced. I just think of like\n\n01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:17.200\ncarnival when we were in Venice, and we were learning about the history of this concept of\n\n01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:21.920\ncarnival, where it was like, Oh, they did this one thing. And they thought it was like a one time\n\n01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:27.440\nthing. And then like the, the nobles were like, we should do this for a month. Oh, like wear masks\n\n01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:32.640\nand rape people. Yeah. Like, like, like, and like, all of this culture like started to like\n\n01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:37.120\novertake the city where it was like, everyone was like, Yeah, this is great. We should just\n\n01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:44.800\nall do this all the time. I'm a bird. I'm not john. I'm a bird. And like, I do what birds do. And it\n\n01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:48.720\nwas like, it was a sort of like, I remember learning about it and being like, this sounds\n\n01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:55.040\nvery, this is what I've what we're experiencing right now, where it's like, there's a anonymity\n\n01:31:55.040 --> 01:32:01.680\nin it. In some, some respects, like it's, it can be like a super powerful liberating thing. But\n\n01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:08.400\noverall, the idea that I think it brings out really, really terrible things. Like it does\n\n01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:13.280\nbecause it's the lack of accountability. The only thing keeping you a good monkey is the fear\n\n01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:19.280\nof all the monkeys beating you up. They, they, they did experiments with bots where they tried\n\n01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:25.680\nto create politeness bots, where that would detect inflammatory language on Twitter, come into a\n\n01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:32.720\nconversation and say, Hey, this is this is much easier to program a bot this way than it is to\n\n01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:38.000\nlike a bot that is also easy, which is just like detects Trump's name and just comes in and goes\n\n01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:47.520\nlike nothing burger. But they made, they tried using bots that would like detect like, spikes of\n\n01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:55.600\nlike, energy inflammatory conversations and come in and just be that person in a, in a conflict that\n\n01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:01.840\nsays to an aggressor, Hey, this other person's a person, even though ironically, the bot is not a\n\n01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.240\nperson. Maybe you should think of them as a person, that kind of stuff, just kind of kind of like a\n\n01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:11.360\nlifeguard or something like that. Or maybe like one of those like speed trap mannequins in a cop\n\n01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:14.880\ncar, where it's like they don't have enough cops. And they just, they actually do just want people\n\n01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:18.160\nto slow down. They don't want to give tickets. So they just put a mannequin in a cop car.\n\n01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:26.240\nBut, and what they found, I think is very interesting, which is that it is absolutely the,\n\n01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:31.520\nthe bots work, that you'll get, you'll get, you'll get people to backpedal, cool down all these\n\n01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:38.880\nthings. If the bot, in addition to doing that has a ton of followers. The is an absolute direct\n\n01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:44.000\nproportion between like, if the bot has two followers and comes in and says like, Hey,\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.120\neverybody take it easy. They just, they're just tinder on the fire. It's just like, Fuck, another\n\n01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:55.360\nfaggot. And if they have 100 followers, if they have 1000 followers, if they have 10,000 followers,\n\n01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:59.520\nit just gets proportionately like, it's more likely that this person who doesn't know this\n\n01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:04.480\nperson because they're a bot, but they have 10,000 illusory followers, the person was more likely\n\n01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:09.520\nto check themselves before they wrecked themselves. And, and, and the definition of wrecking yourself\n\n01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.960\nis quite simply like everybody has one primal fucking chimpanzee fear, which is you're not\n\n01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:19.040\ngoing to live on your own. If everybody gangs up on you and decides you're a douchebag,\n\n01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:23.680\nyou're going to be in the forest wandering around, trying to figure out as a monkey with\n\n01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:29.040\nthose as an ape with no tail, like how to how to avoid spotted leopards when you don't even have\n\n01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:34.640\nyour friends yelling at you. You're dead. That's how chimpanzees kill each other. They just,\n\n01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:40.480\nthey just send Bob Dole off into the woods. They don't bother to rip their nuts off unless\n\n01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:45.520\nthey're young and like trying to start some shit. The old problematic ones, they just go, See you.\n\n01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:54.320\nAnd they go, For real me now? Oh, because to be a chimpanzee and to live alone is to die. And\n\n01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:02.480\nthat is why solitary confinement is, you know, torture and et cetera. So, so, so that's the\n\n01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:10.800\nthing anonymity. If you, that's the, I don't, I think that's, that's fucked up. If you have pure\n\n01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:16.400\nanonymity on the internet, you're, you're taking an end run around that shit. And I think it's also\n\n01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:20.400\nactually kind of uplifting if you, because you get, you get, you get in arguments with anonymous\n\n01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:26.640\npeople and they, they can't help but have an attachment to their ego. Anyway, their name is\n\n01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:33.920\nAIDS Spud. I'm here to piss off women's 69, eat your pussy. Fuck and fuck you. Like, like, like,\n\n01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:37.440\nthey're just, they couldn't have made a clearer decision that they're, what they're going to do\n\n01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:42.480\nis they're going to go and troll on the internet. It's in the way that you use it. I'm cutting my\n\n01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:48.240\nfucking hair weird and I'm going to get on there with my bird mask and I'm going to fuck up women.\n\n01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:53.680\nAnd you, you could have a conversation with one of these characters and like a lot of times like\n\n01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:58.560\nthey'll be like, yeah, but what about this? And it's like, wait, what, this fucking kid, like,\n\n01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:04.080\ndecided to be absolutely anonymous. They're put, they're wearing a screen mask and wearing a whole,\n\n01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:11.360\na running around with a butcher knife and still a lot of them will defend themselves, which they're\n\n01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.480\nlike, I'm not an asshole. Like, why would you care about that when you did all of this, put all\n\n01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:22.400\nthis energy? And the answer is because of that, that fear that unites us, which is, fuck, I'm,\n\n01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:30.640\nI don't want to empirically be found out to be a liability to the species because I will,\n\n01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:36.000\nit's like fun is fun and games are games and fantasies of lack of accountability are great.\n\n01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:45.440\nBut everybody except sociopaths, like, they can be counted on to have that kind of fear. And I,\n\n01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.160\nI guess I'm old, but I'm kind of like, can we start implementing this now can, or at least\n\n01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.280\ncan you please like, if you're talking to someone who you know, like their birth certificate is\n\n01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:00.480\ntheir username, like, that's, that's what being famous means. I'm not my name isn't Mr. Fucking\n\n01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:06.800\nPickles, dude. I'm like, I'm not doing a character. I'm like a guy, like I was born in 1973 and the\n\n01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:13.120\nname and the fucking thing and the barcode and the baby footprint. It's my username on Instagram,\n\n01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:21.200\nmy girlfriend too. Like, so you, you're punching down if you have an account that's like,\n\n01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:29.360\nstick a pine tree up your pussy to 10247333 Trump forever, and you're just like, your girlfriend's\n\n01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:34.480\na gold digger and you're a piece of shit. And it's like, like, like, like, okay, you, now that\n\n01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:40.640\nyou have that power, what are you going to fucking do with it? You, you, you wretched fucking little\n\n01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:47.840\nshit that I was when I was 11. We were like running across each other's yards back then.\n\n01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.240\nIt was like, oh, if anybody that said, get off my lawn, they were like, oh, you're evil or my brother.\n\n01:37:52.240 --> 01:38:00.240\nGet off my lawn, you're evil, evil, evil, evil.\n\n01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:10.560\nWhat about that? Hey, this is what about a lawn that what about like a like a monster house,\n\n01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:18.320\nbut the lawn is the lawn is a mummy. The lawn is a mummy.\n\n01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:25.280\nMummy lawn, mummy lawn, mummy lawn. Why do they mummify the lawn?\n\n01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:32.160\nThe grass is mummified the lawn to wrap, wrapped up in grass.\n\n01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:39.600\nOh, so the grass is the is the wrapping. Yeah, man. So the lawn, so the, we, we walk by\n\n01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:44.720\nlawns every day and we just think, oh, there's some nice grass, but underneath that grass,\n\n01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:50.240\nit's all mummies. All mummies. Or at least that one house. That one house. What about a,\n\n01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:57.520\nwhat about a Pixar movie called lawns? And each lawn is like a celebrity. And, but there's a lawn\n\n01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:06.320\nthat wants to be on another lawn. Is it called the grass is always greener? No. I thought it was\n\n01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:11.200\ncalled lawn. It's called lawns. It sounds like it's called rape culture. It's because I wish I could\n\n01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:21.600\nbe on a lawn. It's not going to work. It's important that I have a place where I can work through\n\n01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:27.040\nthese ideas. Yeah. Thank God. I mean, if I, if I was at home thinking about this, I wouldn't\n\n01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.520\nhave any feedback. I'd be like, well, maybe I should pitch this might end up on CBS. You\n\n01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:36.160\nmight end up forced to watch it. Your children might grow up right now in Sweden. They're writing\n\n01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:41.520\nall these ideas down and building a studio behind it. What if, what if, what if a tree\n\n01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.080\ngrew upside down? What if it was like,\n\n01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:53.680\nlike what if it roots? Did you say a root root? What if the roots are up in the air\n\n01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:00.400\nand then the tree was going down into the ground, right? Yeah, let's call it roots.\n\n01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.480\nOkay. All right. Moving on. What, what about mail? What about mail?\n\n01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:12.240\nLike, no one knows the secret life of mail. My name, Barry.\n\n01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:19.520\nLike, uh, you know, the, the postmaster drops off the mail and then like, like, so then you have\n\n01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:26.320\nlike Cliff Clavin's like the voice of a catalog and he's like, oh boy, I can't wait to get taken\n\n01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:33.680\nup to the dining room table. And then there's like a new character who's like, I'm a citation\n\n01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:38.880\nor something. I don't know. Yeah, you don't really have relationships with your, your mail. What?\n\n01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:46.560\nWhat about a world? Sorry, what? I didn't mean to\n\n01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:55.440\ndo that. I'm a little sleep deprived trying to be anonymous. What about a world where automobiles\n\n01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:02.320\nare wheels, but instead of the, but they have four little cars, right? Okay. All right. See,\n\n01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:07.360\nthis guy, why am I trying to do this? You're the master. This is what I do guys. The car is made\n\n01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:14.000\nof wheel. The cars, the cars are wheels and they have four cars. You call it as wheels. Yeah,\n\n01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.240\nyeah. Each wheel is a car. Yeah. Yeah. Do they have a relationship with the macro car? Or is\n\n01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:26.720\nit fractal based? Is it like, do the, if you zoom in on the, no, it can't be. What fractal? Well,\n\n01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.800\nI mean, like if you zoom in on the cars that are the wheels, you're not going to see, you're\n\n01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:45.520\ngoing to see regular cars, not wheel cars. No, they have little legs. Wait, describe the wheel\n\n01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:50.320\nfor me on a car. We see a cargo by, I zoom in on the front left wheel and what do I, what am I\n\n01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:56.320\nlooking at? There are no wheels on the baby cars. No, I'm talking about like, well, don't do that\n\n01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:02.240\nto yourself. I didn't mean to take it to the, like, like just, he, his original pitch. Okay. Yeah.\n\n01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.880\nI'm confused. You got a car. You got, you know how there's like a, usually there's like a chassis,\n\n01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:12.400\nso picture like a VW Beetle. Gotcha. Now just picture a wheel in place of that. Gotcha. Okay.\n\n01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:17.520\nAnd then you're like, and then you go, well, what, what the hell? And then you're like, what are the,\n\n01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:22.080\nwhat are the tires on this thing? Right. So there's four of them, right? Yeah. So each of the four\n\n01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:28.400\ntires on that, on that tire car, you look, and then they, they're little Volkswagen's. Yeah.\n\n01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:35.520\nLike skates, like, like a big, a big tire with skates. Yeah. On each side. Yeah. A total of four.\n\n01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.440\nOh, so it's done. And then those, and then those have legs. Well, I don't think you have to do\n\n01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:43.280\nlegs. I did that because you put me in a corner. Yeah, I don't, I don't, I think, I think that's\n\n01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.840\nthe thing. It's like, you got to know when to take the drawing away from the kid. You know. No,\n\n01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.080\nno, no. Okay. So that's, that's where we start. That's where we start. I think if there's a sequel,\n\n01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:54.080\nwe could go there. The wheels don't spin. There's just a car at the bottom of each wheel. Well,\n\n01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:58.000\nyou call it, you call it opposite day. So everything, you know, like it's, you know,\n\n01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:06.080\nso a helicopter would be the blade is where we sit and a body would spin. Exactly. Right. Yeah.\n\n01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:13.280\nAnd then in a parachute would open itself up and a person would come out. Right. Right. And then,\n\n01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:20.400\nand then, and then the tree, this could work with your, this could be cinematic universe,\n\n01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:27.360\nthe tree grows down, the roots grow up, and the wheel goes round and round. And your plants water\n\n01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:32.560\nyou. Yeah. Every morning, your plant comes over and pour you a little glass of water.\n\n01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:42.880\nEverybody's president, except one person that we vote for every four years to not be president.\n\n01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:49.040\nAnd they get blamed for everything. They're like, all right, let's do this. Where are you building\n\n01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:54.960\nthat wall and paying for it? They're like, I'm not, I'm not president. You better do something.\n\n01:43:54.960 --> 01:44:01.040\nBut nobody wants to be, nobody wants to be the not president because they have to pay all the\n\n01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:06.800\ntaxes for everything. They're like, shit, I don't want to be there. Should we do a scene from that\n\n01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:20.000\nmovie where Jeff is Benicio del Toro as the curtain? I'm the curtain. Yeah. And it's opposite world,\n\n01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:26.480\nso you know how that goes. Right. Yeah. You're strung across the window and there's a big curtain\n\n01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:33.680\nrod hanging in the middle of you. I will be Jean-Claude Van Damme, of course, as a roller skate\n\n01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:40.160\nthat is just, yeah, opposite roller skate. We can get into that later.\n\n01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:46.480\nSo I'm an opposite curtain. Yeah. Okay. You can make up your own version of it. I'm sorry.\n\n01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.920\nNo, no, I mean, I'm trying to wrap my Benicio del Toro brain around that.\n\n01:44:49.920 --> 01:45:08.080\nAll right, all right. Rob will, of course, be Will Smith, I heard from the audience.\n\n01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:15.360\nTwo light skins, two light skins. Well, there's no such thing. I think you'll find is the moral of\n\n01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:23.280\nthis movie. Is that the voice where I might just opposite Dave Will Smith? No, you're Will Smith\n\n01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:45.680\nand you're a candle. And Brandon is played by Rosie Perez. I'm just ready for anything. Rosie\n\n01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:59.200\nPerez and your table. I'm tired of just sitting here. And it's opposite world. So all of those\n\n01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:10.560\nrules are, they're not what you think. Okay. There's the Pixar logo is that lamp like stomping\n\n01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:17.040\nthe eye or whatever that still happens. And then now we're coming through clouds. And then who are\n\n01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:30.080\nyou Dan? I'm a roller skate. And you played by played by Michael McDonald. I forgot. This is\n\n01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:38.640\ngoing to be terrible. What a what a wonderful day to be a rollerskate. I like to be a roller skate.\n\n01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:56.480\nI like to roll around on my way to home. I am a roller skate wheel that has tiny roller skates\n\n01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:03.440\nfor each of four wheels. You saw that coming. But it's dealt out piecemeal so that the audience\n\n01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:10.880\ncan start to understand this world's not normal. Here I go going home can't wait because it's\n\n01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:15.200\nmy birthday. I am Jean-Claude Van Damme. No, I'm not Jean-Claude. He wouldn't identify himself\n\n01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:23.760\nthat way. I am I am I'm roll I'm roller skate. He proceeds up his stairs to his house. Oh,\n\n01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:32.000\nno, no, no, no, no. He goes down his stairs. Good point. To somebody else's house.\n\n01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:38.000\nTime. Yeah. Time to go downstairs to someone else's house.\n\n01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:45.440\nLona. That's the opposite of that's the opposite of hiya.\n\n01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:50.160\nGod. Lona. Lona.\n\n01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.640\nHello is me Roli.\n\n01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:06.320\nHey, Roli. I'm just sitting at these people eating my lunch. Oh, opposite table. Yeah.\n\n01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:21.680\nYou like my shore shores? We guess whose birthday it isn't. What? You don't look at day under.\n\n01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:29.120\nTink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink. Oh, don't answer that.\n\n01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:42.480\nThe curtains. Oh, I'm outside the window. Somebody open the window so I can be inside.\n\n01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:53.920\nThe curtains are outside the window because they're opposite. Lona. Whatever you do,\n\n01:48:53.920 --> 01:49:06.160\ndon't let them in. I'll do that then because I'm your best enemy. Yes, I hate both of you guys.\n\n01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:11.040\nOh, you do. I mean, and by guys, I mean, I hate one of you as a guy and one of you as a woman.\n\n01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:17.200\nNo, no, no. I'm closing the window, which makes it open. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Curtin.\n\n01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:23.920\nOh, I hate you so much. Oh, I hate you too. Hey, the phone's just starting to talk for no\n\n01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:31.760\nreason, just without it even being off the handle. Let's just talk it. Hey, it's me. I'm the candle.\n\n01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:37.760\nI live next door and I'm burning the wax at both ends here.\n\n01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:44.160\nSo I'm just a flame in the middle and there's like wax on both sides of me.\n\n01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:50.480\nIf you notice, on the ground, I'm a curtain rod, but I go upwards.\n\n01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:53.840\nThat's great. I'm on the phone. I can't see any of that.\n\n01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:57.040\nDon't come over because we're not having a funeral.\n\n01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:09.600\nI want you to be louder because I can almost hear my television. So please be louder.\n\n01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:13.120\nDon't come over. We would hate to see you.\n\n01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.680\nI will. The phone hangs up and then it rings.\n\n01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:27.760\nI just walked the fuck into the house.\n\n01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:33.840\nThe candle, that's like an opposite of a candle to just walk in the house.\n\n01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:39.920\nWell, I didn't wait till I leave and then you'll get it.\n\n01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:44.080\nHey, you know what? The way you're behaving, if somebody should kill you,\n\n01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:52.480\nyou know, one of these days is going to be me for you. I'm a curtain.\n\n01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:58.160\nOh, it'll be multiple me's for you. Curtains.\n\n01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:05.840\nWell, I'm here again, as I always am, to pick up my mail that was delivered at your place.\n\n01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:15.200\nI'm going to take these mails and leave. And after I leave,\n\n01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:21.040\nI'm going to knock on the door and go, somebody stop this.\n\n01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:28.640\nBut then then we zoom in on the mail and then now it's now it's the mail spin off.\n\n01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:34.960\nYeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Trader Joe's coupon booklet.\n\n01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:43.360\nHow come you always, how come I'm always tucked inside of you, Trader Joe's coupon booklet?\n\n01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:50.000\nHey, let me tell you something. Do you know who I am? I'm jury ballot letter.\n\n01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:54.320\nI'm the jury guy that tells you to be on the jury.\n\n01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:56.320\nHey, I'm Trader Joe's coupon book.\n\n01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.800\nYeah, I know, I'm stuffed inside you all the fucking time.\n\n01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:02.720\nYou two should stop fighting. Oh, no, no.\n\n01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:09.920\nListen to me. I am Xena, the Amazon Prime Princess.\n\n01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:18.080\nYou guys are making me look so ugly. And all I do is stare at myself.\n\n01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:25.120\nTis I, Vanity Fair. Vanity Fair, I've been jerking off to you ever since that we were\n\n01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:31.280\nputting that that mail sack. Me too. I've been jerking off to you since Thursday.\n\n01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:40.560\nAnd it's Friday. Xena, Xena, I only, I only heard stories about you. I didn't think you\n\n01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:47.040\nactually existed. Yeah, I do. Hey, did you know that cottage cheese is you get two for one now\n\n01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:58.320\nat Trader Joe's? I did not. I did. Go, go, go, go, go. Hey, what gives with this mailbox?\n\n01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:06.880\nIs it going with the rest of the property? This just an old mailbox. No one cares about\n\n01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:15.200\nwhat's been delivered in it. Just rip it out, take it to the landfill tomorrow at six.\n\n01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:21.200\nOh Xena, Xena, this is our home for the next, maybe a day or so until the person comes up\n\n01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:27.920\nand brings us into the kitchen table. Hey, that's too bad. Old woman withers had a heart attack.\n\n01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:34.800\nSo no one's going to ever get the mail inside this thing. You got a stamp on me.\n\n01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:44.320\nSorry, right? You put a stamp on me. I don't want to cancel our fraternity.\n\n01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:51.840\nYou had to lick it then stick it, but now we're going to be in a landfill.\n\n01:53:53.600 --> 01:54:01.280\nMail story on Fox. Yeah, I like that opposite world has a self-contained non-opposite shitty\n\n01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:07.440\nmail picture. It's kind of like the young ones where they would go to the refrigerator and talk\n\n01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:16.960\nto the eggs. Remember that? I do. The eggs. Oh, we did it. We did it. We did 10 minutes of the\n\n01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:23.040\nworst improv of anybody's life. I think that opposite thing was maybe a misguided. Maybe it\n\n01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:28.960\nwas the best idea. It's hard to be an opposite curtain. I was like, I had my brain kind of\n\n01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.880\nfrozen. I was wondering what you're going to do with that. I mean, I was outside, but then you\n\n01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:39.280\ngot to be... Who was your celebrity? The worst beneath Yieldal Toro. I ended up sounding more\n\n01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:52.240\nlike a strong bat from Homestar Runner. Do we want to guard your window from the sunlight?\n\n01:54:52.240 --> 01:55:01.120\nWe shout not a charity? Okay, opposite man. What wasn't your question?\n\n01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:09.360\nNo, you're not. You are so not sorry. Well, it's opposite world. It means he's not sorry.\n\n01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:13.600\nWhat's your question? Oh, boy.\n\n01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:17.120\nI don't really understand. What's your favorite prank you've ever been given?\n\n01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:26.080\nWhat's our favorite prank we've ever... That question. I don't know if Mike's\n\n01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:30.240\npicked it up, but his friend or maybe not. Maybe just a stranger was...\n\n01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:33.440\nI was going to say the wheel sound of that. The wheel sound of that.\n\n01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:37.520\nThe wheel sound of that. I came in and I was like, uncontrollable derision.\n\n01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:42.880\nI'm like, oh my God, I can't keep the mirth from...\n\n01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:52.080\nHe just gave up halfway through it. He's like, what's the favorite prank that she... I don't know.\n\n01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:01.360\nDan, you've been a victim of... What's your favorite prank or least favorite prank\n\n01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:06.320\nthat you either have or haven't been either the victim of or have perpetrated on another person\n\n01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:14.160\nor yourself in opposite... Well, I really don't know what the question is,\n\n01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:20.640\nbut I know my favorite prank show of all time was Alan Funtz Playboy Channel prank show,\n\n01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:29.680\nbecause it was so humanistic. None of the marks were ever... They were just poor people that had\n\n01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:34.640\nclearly answered an ad that was like, your job is to come in and answer the phones in this like\n\n01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:41.360\noffice and they never... They were just... They would come in and they were already...\n\n01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:45.840\nThey were thinking like, oh, I'm going to make $5 an hour answering a phone,\n\n01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:49.920\nand then the voice on the other end is Alan Funtz, and then like a naked woman would come in or\n\n01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:55.360\nsomething. Just something like really an impossibly thin amount of variation on the idea of like a\n\n01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:01.520\nnaked woman coming in and going like, I'm naked. Can I say that? And it was just basically like\n\n01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:08.560\njust every man like answering the phone Alan Funtz would call and go, hey, what the fuck is going\n\n01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:13.920\non in there? What's going on? I just want... And then the poor person would just be like,\n\n01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:21.760\nI don't know. She's naked. I don't know. She's naked. What the fuck? What the fuck's going on over\n\n01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:27.200\nthere? And it was like... Yeah, no, he said fuck every other word. I think it was like to make it\n\n01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:32.480\nthe Playboy Channel worthy. It was like, there was a... What the fuck is happening? And it was like\n\n01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:37.440\nAlan Funtz's voice. And then after a while they'd go, hey, you're on naked, candid camera,\n\n01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:41.120\nand the person would go, great. And they'd give him more money than they thought they were going\n\n01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:45.840\nto get. My favorite... I wasn't involved in this one, but our friend Drew Carey... On the Drew Carey\n\n01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:51.440\nshow, Drew had like wrapped a season. It was going to go on a vacation. And he had like an assistant\n\n01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:55.040\nand they had his luggage backstage. And I think it was somebody in the prop department on the\n\n01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:02.800\nDrew Carey show at Warner Brothers, took an enormous like foot and a half long rubber dildo\n\n01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.240\nand put a bunch of metal screws in it and then put it in his bag so it would set off the metal\n\n01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:16.400\ndetector. So when he got through security, hey, I'm Drew Carey, how's it going? Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:22.320\nAnd then they, sir, and they pulled out this giant fucking dildo and apparently Drew, when he came\n\n01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:27.440\nback, didn't talk to anybody in the set for a month. Speaking of pranks, though, I guess this\n\n01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:31.120\nfits the category. We should have Eric Andre on the show. If you guys have been watching Eric Andre,\n\n01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:35.840\nI bet. Like I just, I even know those are one of those shows like Adam Ruins, everything. I've\n\n01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:39.520\nnever watched it. And then Mike McMahon one day at Rick and Morty's writer's room was like,\n\n01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:44.240\nhave you seen Eric Andre? So when we started binging Eric Andre, I was like, holy shit,\n\n01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:49.840\nlike really funny. But it'd be interesting to... I've chatted with him and stuff at like\n\n01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:55.120\nup fronts, like know who he is, but never, but hadn't, I think he would be interesting to talk to\n\n01:58:55.120 --> 01:59:02.000\nabout the ins and outs of his show. Absolutely. I was a season two of punked. So I have 15 pranks\n\n01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:10.240\non various celebrities. I'm just going to say the time we made Usher, we made Usher write a jingle\n\n01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:14.240\nand told him that his brother had stolen women's clothing from a shop in Beverly Hills.\n\n01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:18.160\nAnd then we had to say to him, Mike, and this is how we want the jingle to go Usher.\n\n01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:22.560\nHe thought he was writing a jingle to get his brother out of\n\n01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:26.240\nHock with the place he had shoplifted at. We told him and his brother was there and his brother\n\n01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:32.800\nwas like, I stole these clothes for these women that I'm trying to see. And I'm in trouble. And\n\n01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:38.320\nit was like a kitsyn or some shit. And we were like, well, you can get out of this if you write,\n\n01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:42.640\nif you sing this jingle for the store. And Usher was like, he looked at his brother and he goes,\n\n01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:48.720\nit's not sexy, man. What you're doing right now in the store stealing clothes is not sexy.\n\n01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:58.160\nAs if they had had a discussion prior. Wow. I had one steal. It's not sexy. You gotta be like\n\n01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:03.680\nUsher. Your Usher's brother, you're supposed to go out there and be sexy. It's supposed to do sexy\n\n02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:13.600\nthings. Right. So yeah, pranks. Did he write a jingle? He did not. He was like, I will just take\n\n02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:20.800\nthe hit. I'll buy the shit. I'll buy the shit. My niece, Stephanie, when she was like maybe five,\n\n02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:28.480\nI was, I don't know, eight. She was staying in the guest room in our house. I went and got under\n\n02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:35.360\nher bed like an hour before she went to bed. So I was in there. Oh no. This isn't a prank though.\n\n02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:42.720\nAnd I tilted the mirror like on the wardrobe kind of thing. So I held her. You? I was probably\n\n02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:49.120\nlast year. No, no, no. 32. I would say I was like nine years old. Okay. I was actually picturing,\n\n02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:53.920\nthe reason I said oh no is because I was picturing you like 30. No, no, no, no. Okay. No, no,\n\n02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:58.240\nno. She's only a couple years younger than I. So like, she might have been five. I was seven, six,\n\n02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:04.080\neight, something like that. And I tilted the mirror on the chest of drawers so I could kind of see\n\n02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:10.720\nup towards the bed and was in there for an hour and it was uncomfortable and it's cramped. And\n\n02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:18.000\nI used to fuck with her all the time. And she came in and got to bed and I waited another hour.\n\n02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:23.520\nAnd there was enough light to the window and she had a night light so I could see\n\n02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:27.200\nthat she was there. And I waited until she was like settled in bed because she was like,\n\n02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:30.480\nyou know, doing a thing and reading a book or playing with my little pony or whatever.\n\n02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:36.240\nAnd then I waited until she was like just about falling asleep. And I was there for two hours.\n\n02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:51.840\nAnd I went, oh, she leapt 15 feet off the bed, turned the lights on, and I got out of the bed.\n\n02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:59.680\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That was more terrorizing than it ought to have been.\n\n02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:09.280\nThat's fucked up. Well, my brother, I remember he wanted to scare my grandma\n\n02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:17.040\nand he hid down in the basement. So it's starting off with a good idea. For a really long time,\n\n02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:22.080\nthis is my grandma Bunny. She recently passed away, my mom's mom. Is this the one, the stabba dude?\n\n02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:31.200\nNo, no, no, no. That's her mom. That's grandma Bhusha. But grandma Bunny, I guess my brother\n\n02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:36.800\nhid down in the basement because he wanted to scare grandma. And she came down and she was\n\n02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.480\ndoing laundry and he was just hiding and he was kind of biting his time. And then she let the\n\n02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:48.640\nbiggest fart out. And then he started freaking out, laughing and crying and stuff. And I thought\n\n02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:54.560\nthere was a delightful story because she was a little scared, but it was funnier that whatever\n\n02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:59.360\nhe was going to do was more, it's like don't scare an old lady, but it's nicer that she was like,\n\n02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:05.440\nshe was like... And then he was like... And I was like, yeah, why are you putting all this\n\n02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:16.640\nenergy into... The hunter has become the hunter. Cliff Hanger. Thank you all. We love you.
