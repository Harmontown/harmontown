00:00.000 --> 00:26.160
Hello everybody, welcome to Harmontown!

00:26.160 --> 00:30.380
As always, every Monday night here at Meltdown, the Nerdmelt Theatre in Hollywood, California,

00:30.380 --> 00:34.600
Harmontown, it's once again in session to solve all the world's crises.

00:34.600 --> 00:40.500
Once you welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmonn!

00:40.500 --> 00:47.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:47.820 --> 00:49.420
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

00:49.420 --> 00:50.420
Uhh, yeah.

00:50.420 --> 00:51.720
We got lots to talk about.

00:51.720 --> 00:52.720
Uhh...

00:52.720 --> 00:54.020
Let's get right to it then.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.020
Yeah.

00:55.020 --> 01:00.020
I want to talk about the obvious thing later because it's a weird area.

01:00.020 --> 01:05.020
I want to talk about it with friends because I was sealed off today, completely sealed off.

01:05.020 --> 01:10.020
I was writing for Rick and Morty from bed at a deadline and I'm doing my pass on a script

01:10.020 --> 01:14.020
so I was completely turned my phone off, didn't have the internet and it was kind of like,

01:14.020 --> 01:20.020
and then Aaron called me from out in the world and told me about what happened in Boston today

01:20.020 --> 01:25.020
which by the time you're hearing this as a recording, we'll have all these facts but it just happened today

01:25.020 --> 01:31.020
and so what I want to talk about is actually just the craziness about it.

01:31.020 --> 01:35.020
It's not like we're going to score noble points by not talking about it

01:35.020 --> 01:39.020
nor are we going to score any other kind of point by talking about it.

01:39.020 --> 01:44.020
It's endlessly fascinating of course and we should capitalize on it

01:44.020 --> 01:48.020
but because it would be weird to talk about that first

01:48.020 --> 01:52.020
and then talk about Aaron's leg.

01:52.020 --> 01:57.020
I just like the brave new world we live in where you can come out and the audience shows up in Hollywood, California

01:57.020 --> 02:03.020
and a guy comes out with a red solo cup in his hand and just reading off his phone for the first two minutes of the show.

02:03.020 --> 02:04.020
I love it.

02:04.020 --> 02:07.020
I was just holding it up. I'm not reading anything off of it.

02:07.020 --> 02:11.020
This is what my phone says. This is my Evernote app.

02:11.020 --> 02:18.020
It says Aaron's leg, wedding cake, Minecraft, Alex Space Jam, and Zardaz. That's what it says.

02:18.020 --> 02:20.020
That sounds like a full lineup.

02:20.020 --> 02:24.020
I get nervous so I stare at things. I'll put this away.

02:24.020 --> 02:27.020
Aaron's not here tonight because she cut her leg.

02:27.020 --> 02:32.020
Is she a cutter?

02:32.020 --> 02:34.020
Answer the question.

02:34.020 --> 02:45.020
I have these very low, low, thigh-high, tetanus-riddled, sharp, rusty, pirate yard lamps.

02:45.020 --> 02:54.020
As you walk up the stairs to Danadoo and it was a long time coming.

02:54.020 --> 03:02.020
Someone finally, while walking down them, I believe she was cutting a wide berth for her.

03:02.020 --> 03:06.020
She was disembarking for one of Dustin's dates.

03:06.020 --> 03:11.020
For those of you who listen to This Feels Terrible, her podcast, she had just finished recording like a date preamble.

03:11.020 --> 03:17.020
They're doing this bachelor kind of thing where Dustin's going on dates with women that are throwing themselves at Dustin.

03:17.020 --> 03:19.020
It's a horrible affair.

03:19.020 --> 03:24.020
These lovely young ladies are coming over to my house where Farrell Audio is recording its podcast.

03:24.020 --> 03:25.020
Sounds horrible.

03:25.020 --> 03:28.020
Getting interviewed with Dustin and whatnot and then they leave for these dates.

03:28.020 --> 03:33.020
Leaving this date for this date, Aaron escorting them out.

03:33.020 --> 03:41.020
I think to be polite, finally walked close enough to one of these horrible, jagged, toothy cartilage.

03:41.020 --> 03:45.020
I think they're made out of shark cartilage, these yard lights that I have.

03:45.020 --> 03:50.020
They're green and yellow and they're supposed to be just black probably.

03:50.020 --> 03:57.020
But I think they were made in the 1900s and just covered in tetanus.

03:57.020 --> 04:02.020
And honed to her razor's edge right along the path just coated.

04:02.020 --> 04:05.020
It's titanium laminated in tetanus.

04:05.020 --> 04:08.020
So she scraped her thigh on it.

04:08.020 --> 04:14.020
She's got this cut on her leg about the length of, let's say, I don't know what I'm holding up here.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.020
A cigarette.

04:15.020 --> 04:18.020
But the length of my penis looks like three inches.

04:18.020 --> 04:21.020
Your penis is shaped and colored exactly like a cigarette if I'm not mistaken.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.020
Yes.

04:22.020 --> 04:23.020
An E-cigarette.

04:23.020 --> 04:28.020
It has harmless water vapor in it.

04:28.020 --> 04:30.020
But you can get it in any flavor.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.020
Cocoa pebbles.

04:32.020 --> 04:34.020
Why is this guy raising his E-cigarette?

04:34.020 --> 04:35.020
Oh, you're holding up your E-cigarette.

04:35.020 --> 04:36.020
Are you a vapor?

04:36.020 --> 04:37.020
Are you vaping?

04:37.020 --> 04:38.020
Yeah.

04:38.020 --> 04:40.020
Do you vape indoors?

04:40.020 --> 04:41.020
Yeah, at work.

04:41.020 --> 04:42.020
I don't give a shit.

04:42.020 --> 04:43.020
Are you a former smoker?

04:43.020 --> 04:44.020
Yes.

04:44.020 --> 04:46.020
Okay, so, hey, come up here.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.020
What's your name?

04:47.020 --> 04:48.020
I'm sorry, if you want to come up here.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.020
I learned my...

04:49.020 --> 04:53.020
Okay, yeah, because if you start crying or freaking out, I don't want to...

04:53.020 --> 04:54.020
Hey, why did you come up here?

04:54.020 --> 04:55.020
You told me to.

04:55.020 --> 04:56.020
What's your name, sir?

04:56.020 --> 04:57.020
You told me to come up here, dude.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.020
I was drinking.

04:58.020 --> 04:59.020
What's your name?

04:59.020 --> 05:00.020
Tyler.

05:00.020 --> 05:01.020
Tyler, everybody.

05:01.020 --> 05:02.020
Welcome, Tyler.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.020
Here we go.

05:03.020 --> 05:04.020
Okay.

05:04.020 --> 05:06.020
All right, an unexpected segment about E-cigarettes.

05:06.020 --> 05:07.020
It's fun.

05:07.020 --> 05:13.020
Then we'll talk about the worst terrorist attack in our country since 9-11.

05:13.020 --> 05:15.020
But first, E-cigarettes.

05:15.020 --> 05:17.020
Fat or fashion?

05:17.020 --> 05:18.020
I don't know.

05:18.020 --> 05:20.020
Okay, so there's water...

05:20.020 --> 05:21.020
There's water vapor.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.020
Yeah, water vapor.

05:22.020 --> 05:24.020
Well, water vapor is the only emission.

05:24.020 --> 05:28.020
It starts off with the chemical that is food coloring, which is...

05:28.020 --> 05:29.020
We're not going to get into it.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.020
Purple or glycerin.

05:30.020 --> 05:31.020
Okay.

05:31.020 --> 05:33.020
Flavor, and then however much nicotine you want.

05:33.020 --> 05:34.020
Right.

05:34.020 --> 05:37.020
So I know people who smoke E-cigarettes at work.

05:37.020 --> 05:38.020
They're into it.

05:38.020 --> 05:39.020
They're not into it.

05:39.020 --> 05:43.020
I know someone who doesn't smoke at all and kind of got into it just because everyone else

05:43.020 --> 05:44.020
at work was doing it.

05:44.020 --> 05:45.020
Well, this is a new thing.

05:45.020 --> 05:46.020
It's a new thing.

05:46.020 --> 05:48.020
I'm going to bed next to my girlfriend today.

05:48.020 --> 05:50.020
She comes back from getting her antibiotics.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.020
She's holding a bag.

05:51.020 --> 05:52.020
She goes, I got it.

05:52.020 --> 05:54.020
I know I keep going off on our diet.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.020
It's because I come for it and all this stuff.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.020
She does this big monologue.

05:58.020 --> 06:00.020
And I'm like, what is it going to happen?

06:00.020 --> 06:03.020
There's this thing that ends with couples therapy.

06:03.020 --> 06:06.020
It's my fault that we always eat mac and cheese.

06:06.020 --> 06:08.020
She pulls out E-cigarettes.

06:08.020 --> 06:09.020
Just today.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.020
This is why I brought you up here.

06:10.020 --> 06:12.020
For the both of you, like, his and hers E-cigarettes?

06:12.020 --> 06:13.020
No, no.

06:13.020 --> 06:15.020
I can't touch them for religious reasons.

06:15.020 --> 06:16.020
I'll explain later.

06:16.020 --> 06:18.020
I believe it.

06:18.020 --> 06:24.020
But I want to know about this because she got zero nicotine E-cigarettes.

06:24.020 --> 06:25.020
Yeah.

06:25.020 --> 06:28.020
I mean, I guess you get kind of the experience from it.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.020
You breathe in.

06:29.020 --> 06:30.020
You're like, oh, something's going in.

06:30.020 --> 06:31.020
You breathe out.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.020
It has what they call a throat hit.

06:33.020 --> 06:34.020
It has a throat hit.

06:34.020 --> 06:36.020
That's the worst name, though.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.020
Throat hit.

06:37.020 --> 06:39.020
Like, oh, man, I got this 36 milligram.

06:39.020 --> 06:41.020
It's got the best throat hit.

06:41.020 --> 06:46.020
And guys in their basements modding power drill batteries into E-cig things.

06:46.020 --> 06:47.020
Yeah, no.

06:47.020 --> 06:48.020
What they're modifying.

06:48.020 --> 06:49.020
There's something.

06:49.020 --> 06:54.020
It looks like they're holding an electric screwdriver in their hands.

06:54.020 --> 06:56.020
To get more nicotine?

06:56.020 --> 06:57.020
Yeah.

06:57.020 --> 07:00.020
So the battery causes the coil to heat faster so they get this.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.020
Yeah, no.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.020
They're like, I totally hacked my E-cigarettes.

07:03.020 --> 07:04.020
Exactly.

07:04.020 --> 07:05.020
No.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.020
I put tobacco in it.

07:06.020 --> 07:07.020
Exactly that.

07:07.020 --> 07:09.020
I jail broke that motherfucker in there.

07:09.020 --> 07:11.020
Basically.

07:11.020 --> 07:17.020
I drove by a gas station and it said electronic cigarettes.

07:17.020 --> 07:22.020
That sounds like a joke from a sketch group that was shitty 20 years ago.

07:22.020 --> 07:29.020
Or a horrible 1994 direct-to-video movie set in the future with a lot of kickboxing in it.

07:29.020 --> 07:31.020
A throat hit is a critical punch, sure.

07:31.020 --> 07:32.020
That's true.

07:32.020 --> 07:33.020
That's not what I mean.

07:33.020 --> 07:39.020
I just mean like in Aliens, you see Sigourney Weaver lights up a cigarette and of course the prop masters say,

07:39.020 --> 07:42.020
hey look, what is it going to be just like a marble red?

07:42.020 --> 07:43.020
No, make it yellow.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.020
Make it yellow.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.020
Make it glow.

07:45.020 --> 07:49.020
Throughout history we've been trying to figure out something that Bogart would do.

07:49.020 --> 07:52.020
If your movie's set in the future, we've experimented with varieties.

07:52.020 --> 07:54.020
Now we're living in the world.

07:54.020 --> 07:56.020
It lights up with LEDs.

07:56.020 --> 07:59.020
It lights up with LEDs and smoke comes out.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.020
It's interesting.

08:00.020 --> 08:04.020
And also of course when you introduce technology into people's mania and addictions,

08:04.020 --> 08:07.020
you're going to have people in their basement soupin' them up.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.020
That's exactly what it is.

08:08.020 --> 08:15.020
You've got it, but it's as opposed to, I mean I suppose there's an element of it that's the techies kind of up in the hills.

08:15.020 --> 08:17.020
Alright, what's your name?

08:17.020 --> 08:18.020
Tyler.

08:18.020 --> 08:19.020
Tyler.

08:19.020 --> 08:25.020
So the big question for me is because my girlfriend came home today with e-cigarettes that she, as a non-smoker,

08:25.020 --> 08:31.020
I quit when I was 32 and I cannot, I quit, I made a deal with God that I cannot go back on.

08:31.020 --> 08:32.020
It's probably a good idea.

08:32.020 --> 08:36.020
As much as I'm tempted to, because these things will look interesting to me,

08:36.020 --> 08:41.020
I can't put one in my mouth because I don't know if God knows the difference.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.020
Yeah?

08:42.020 --> 08:45.020
And what I want to know is, what is she inhaling?

08:45.020 --> 08:48.020
She's like all, she's like, well it's zero nicotine.

08:48.020 --> 08:50.020
I'm like, yeah, but you're inhaling something.

08:50.020 --> 08:52.020
I looked online, it's like, basically it's like...

08:52.020 --> 08:56.020
So there's nothing burning, I mean there's nothing that is turning into a carcinogen.

08:56.020 --> 08:58.020
You're not setting something on fire and inhaling it.

08:58.020 --> 09:02.020
You're turning a chemical into vapor.

09:02.020 --> 09:05.020
It's basically like you said, like food coloring in there.

09:05.020 --> 09:08.020
I mean you're just, you're smoking food coloring with nicotine and flavor in it.

09:08.020 --> 09:11.020
But it's not, you're not burning it, it's just turning into a vapor.

09:11.020 --> 09:15.020
You hold down a button, it superheats a coil, you inhale it.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.020
You're like, this is...

09:16.020 --> 09:21.020
And it said the FDA says that there's no significant health risks.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.020
Absolutely.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.020
Yeah, I mean it's...

09:23.020 --> 09:25.020
We're talking about the zero nicotine.

09:25.020 --> 09:28.020
Sir Walter Rawley said the same thing about tobacco.

09:28.020 --> 09:30.020
I mean, and the FDA says the same thing about...

09:30.020 --> 09:32.020
Right, it's somewhere in the...

09:32.020 --> 09:36.020
It's somewhere in the thousands of magnitude as bad for you as a normal cigarette.

09:36.020 --> 09:38.020
Yeah, a millionth, it's a millionth.

09:38.020 --> 09:39.020
Or more, yeah.

09:39.020 --> 09:41.020
Some of them have a one millionth of whatever.

09:41.020 --> 09:44.020
But while we're on the topic and I have you up here, so you're a former smoker.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.020
Yes.

09:45.020 --> 09:48.020
Now you're using e-cigarettes to quit or how long?

09:48.020 --> 09:49.020
It's cheaper.

09:49.020 --> 09:52.020
I can do it at my desk at work.

09:52.020 --> 09:53.020
It doesn't matter.

09:53.020 --> 09:54.020
It's a thing.

09:54.020 --> 09:56.020
So I mean, I work at a video game company.

09:56.020 --> 09:57.020
We're kind of cool kids.

09:57.020 --> 09:58.020
Does it really fulfill the craving?

09:58.020 --> 09:59.020
It does, though.

09:59.020 --> 10:01.020
Look at him, he's ripped right now.

10:01.020 --> 10:03.020
He's just jamming on nicotine then.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.020
How do you know?

10:04.020 --> 10:09.020
Because when I smoked, I quit at 32, you smoke down to the filter and then you put it out

10:09.020 --> 10:12.020
so you have that satisfaction of the progress indicator.

10:12.020 --> 10:15.020
So, you know, I have friends of mine who are packet A smokers.

10:15.020 --> 10:17.020
I was never a packet A smoker.

10:17.020 --> 10:20.020
I would pack every couple days or maybe if I was out drinking a packet A.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.020
But mostly, like, I would pack every few days.

10:23.020 --> 10:25.020
Like, I smoke just when I feel like it.

10:25.020 --> 10:28.020
I get a couple puffs of it and then that's it.

10:28.020 --> 10:29.020
Oh, okay.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.020
That's like, I feel like, oh, I'm good.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.020
We're good.

10:31.020 --> 10:32.020
All right.

10:32.020 --> 10:35.020
So nicotine, I learned in biology class.

10:35.020 --> 10:37.020
I thought I remembered hearing this.

10:37.020 --> 10:39.020
I thought nicotine was the carcinogen.

10:39.020 --> 10:43.020
I thought that nicotine is a molecule that shaped like a roof shingle that flies like

10:43.020 --> 10:49.020
a karate star into your lung tissue and has a one in a billion chance of cleaving your

10:49.020 --> 10:52.020
cellular membrane into your DNA.

10:52.020 --> 10:58.020
And just like, the reason why you eventually get lung cancer is because every puff you inhale

10:58.020 --> 11:03.020
of nicotine is a one in a zillion, billion, zillion, billion, billion chance of one of

11:03.020 --> 11:08.020
these throwing stars like cutting the exact part of your double helix that makes the cell

11:08.020 --> 11:10.020
go, I want to make more cells.

11:10.020 --> 11:11.020
Pretty much.

11:11.020 --> 11:14.020
And nicotine in and of itself is fine.

11:14.020 --> 11:17.020
That was a white trash guy, not a black guy.

11:17.020 --> 11:18.020
Well done.

11:18.020 --> 11:19.020
Nicotine in and of itself is fine.

11:19.020 --> 11:21.020
Cancer is not a black caricature.

11:21.020 --> 11:24.020
It's a dirty, white, poor person.

11:24.020 --> 11:25.020
It was a little racist.

11:25.020 --> 11:27.020
It was not racist.

11:27.020 --> 11:31.020
What is the black enemy of the human genome?

11:31.020 --> 11:34.020
Oh, do you want to hear black human genome?

11:34.020 --> 11:35.020
What he would sound like?

11:35.020 --> 11:36.020
Exactly.

11:36.020 --> 11:39.020
I intend to create.

11:39.020 --> 11:42.020
I intend to do so responsibly.

11:42.020 --> 11:45.020
He sounds like a very articulate gentleman.

11:45.020 --> 11:47.020
I woke up at nine this morning.

11:47.020 --> 11:49.020
I brushed my teeth.

11:49.020 --> 11:52.020
I have a wife that I love very much.

11:52.020 --> 11:58.020
And I oversee the reproduction of various viscera to keep the human body alive.

11:58.020 --> 12:01.020
What nationality is diabetes?

12:01.020 --> 12:03.020
Italian.

12:03.020 --> 12:05.020
Diabetes?

12:05.020 --> 12:07.020
Oh, you never eat.

12:07.020 --> 12:08.020
I have a cake.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.020
I would have thought Hawaiian.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.020
Oh, diabetes.

12:12.020 --> 12:13.020
Or Greek.

12:13.020 --> 12:14.020
It seems Greek.

12:14.020 --> 12:15.020
It seems pretty Greek.

12:15.020 --> 12:22.020
Diabetes stole sugar from Mount Olympus and was chained to a giant cake.

12:22.020 --> 12:26.020
And an eagle sticks a dipstick into his liver.

12:26.020 --> 12:29.020
Now, you said that Aaron came into your...

12:29.020 --> 12:36.020
A couple of Greek mythology majors just had a conniption fit.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.020
I don't think that's right.

12:38.020 --> 12:41.020
He remembers the eagle.

12:41.020 --> 12:45.020
So you said that Aaron got into your bed and she was singing the praises of e-cigarettes or what?

12:45.020 --> 12:48.020
She came home with a bag because she wouldn't get antibiotics.

12:48.020 --> 12:49.020
She came home.

12:49.020 --> 12:52.020
She stopped at the gas station and by one of the ones there.

12:52.020 --> 12:54.020
I don't know where she was, but she came home.

12:54.020 --> 12:56.020
And I was just going like...

12:56.020 --> 12:59.020
Like I said, I'm eight years, no smoking.

12:59.020 --> 13:01.020
And I just flipped out.

13:01.020 --> 13:05.020
So I started googling, even though I had writing to do.

13:05.020 --> 13:09.020
It was ironic because while I was googling, there was this event that I'm describing earlier.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.020
I wasn't googling the right things.

13:12.020 --> 13:15.020
I just was like...

13:15.020 --> 13:18.020
I was typing in things like, the truth about e-cigarettes.

13:18.020 --> 13:21.020
That always leads you somewhere nice.

13:21.020 --> 13:23.020
The bottom line right now is basically like...

13:23.020 --> 13:26.020
It kind of smells like a fog machine for a second.

13:26.020 --> 13:30.020
She's in bed next to me and she has this little plastic stick that she sucks on.

13:30.020 --> 13:34.020
Unless you put your face in it, you're not going to get the scent of whatever the hell they flavored it with.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.020
And it's called vaping.

13:36.020 --> 13:38.020
And the kids are doing it.

13:38.020 --> 13:40.020
They had to make a stupid verb out of it.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.020
I hate that term, really.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.020
I'm hanging out with this vaping.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.020
What are you doing?

13:46.020 --> 13:47.020
It's the worst.

13:47.020 --> 13:49.020
Can you put drugs in them?

13:49.020 --> 13:51.020
Can you put weed or hash?

13:51.020 --> 13:52.020
That's the worst thing.

13:52.020 --> 13:54.020
You could probably put hash oil.

13:54.020 --> 13:56.020
If you hacked one, you could probably put some of that hash oil.

13:56.020 --> 13:58.020
You probably could.

13:58.020 --> 14:01.020
I'm just worried that they're going to ruin it for normal-looking people.

14:01.020 --> 14:06.020
They have those hitters that are basically an e-cigarette, but you load them with hash oil.

14:06.020 --> 14:08.020
I was talking to someone who's the pot smoker about, and they were like,

14:08.020 --> 14:11.020
Man, no, because e-cigarettes, like, pot smokers, they're botanists, man.

14:11.020 --> 14:14.020
We're not electronics, not so much.

14:14.020 --> 14:19.020
Well, this botanist got to hold on one of these hash oil things.

14:19.020 --> 14:20.020
I'm sure.

14:20.020 --> 14:24.020
I like sucking on a pen and putting it down and enjoying Zardaz.

14:24.020 --> 14:26.020
That's what it takes, right?

14:26.020 --> 14:27.020
One, two, three.

14:27.020 --> 14:29.020
Wait, wait, you're on hash drink Zardaz?

14:29.020 --> 14:30.020
No, no.

14:30.020 --> 14:32.020
Goddamn, that would be the worst.

14:32.020 --> 14:33.020
I was about to be so jealous.

14:33.020 --> 14:35.020
I was sober watching it, and that was...

14:35.020 --> 14:39.020
Yeah, I watched it sober as a judge last night, and it was a bummer.

14:39.020 --> 14:41.020
Alright, tangent-free night.

14:41.020 --> 14:43.020
Let's thank Tyler and get him out of here.

14:43.020 --> 14:44.020
Tyler!

14:44.020 --> 14:48.020
The truth about e-cigarettes.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.020
No tangents.

14:49.020 --> 14:50.020
We're going to have an orderly night.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.020
That was a brief one.

14:52.020 --> 14:59.020
So, Erin is convalescing, but she wanted me to let you guys know, and I quote,

14:59.020 --> 15:04.020
and I don't know if this is because the tetanus has gone to her brain or...

15:04.020 --> 15:07.020
Or her e-cigarettes have been hacked.

15:07.020 --> 15:10.020
I feel like moving in with me is doing weird things to her brain chemistry.

15:10.020 --> 15:11.020
She said,

15:11.020 --> 15:15.020
if any of you are getting married, she will make you a free wedding cake.

15:15.020 --> 15:17.020
Erin, she's cake crazy.

15:17.020 --> 15:24.020
Every 100% of the last 11 times I've been to your place has been a new cake.

15:24.020 --> 15:29.020
And then I went down, she literally has made two cakes now that are miscellaneous cakes.

15:29.020 --> 15:34.020
The first one, we edited it out of the last episode because it wasn't very compelling audio-wise.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.020
Fucker got a cake for his birthday here, right?

15:36.020 --> 15:40.020
It was just, she just wrote, she'll make a cake, and then at a loss, she'll write,

15:40.020 --> 15:41.020
like, yay!

15:41.020 --> 15:45.020
Exclamation point on the cake, and then give it to me and go, bring this to work,

15:45.020 --> 15:48.020
and I'll bring it to work, and I'll go, yay!

15:48.020 --> 15:50.020
So, how old did she get?

15:50.020 --> 15:51.020
28.

15:51.020 --> 15:54.020
28, that's too young for dementia, right?

15:54.020 --> 15:59.020
I mean, yeah, I mean, it's not too young to invent a new thing to be wrong with your brain.

15:59.020 --> 16:05.020
Dan has, as we believe, we've spoken of his Game of Thrones party at Danadoo,

16:05.020 --> 16:09.020
and we were there last night, and Erin makes cakes that are drawings.

16:09.020 --> 16:11.020
Last week was Peter Dinklage.

16:11.020 --> 16:17.020
She made a Dinklage that looked a lot like Cobain, but last night, she made a whip-ass Jon Snow.

16:17.020 --> 16:19.020
Even I knew it was Jon Snow, like, good Jon Snow.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.020
That was a good Jon Snow.

16:20.020 --> 16:26.020
I went down to the kitchen to get some water, or get a glass of some water,

16:26.020 --> 16:30.020
and there's four other boxes of unmade cake mix.

16:30.020 --> 16:33.020
There's proto-cakes already.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.020
She's losing her mind.

16:34.020 --> 16:35.020
Two words.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.020
Citizen Kane.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.020
Remember jigsaw puzzles?

16:37.020 --> 16:39.020
Well, yeah, you did call it Danadoo.

16:39.020 --> 16:40.020
Yeah.

16:40.020 --> 16:41.020
It's too close.

16:41.020 --> 16:44.020
I like to stand in the corner while she's making cakes in the shadows and go,

16:44.020 --> 16:46.020
why are you doing that?

16:46.020 --> 16:48.020
Another cake.

16:48.020 --> 16:52.020
I make them because I like to make them.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.020
You should change the line.

16:53.020 --> 16:55.020
You make a cake, and then people eat it.

16:55.020 --> 16:57.020
What's the point?

16:57.020 --> 17:00.020
There's empires out there, newspapers to own.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.020
I haven't seen Citizen Kane in a long time.

17:03.020 --> 17:05.020
I don't know what he said there.

17:05.020 --> 17:06.020
All right.

17:06.020 --> 17:08.020
Moving right along.

17:08.020 --> 17:09.020
Let's knock this one off the list.

17:09.020 --> 17:11.020
Hey, Alex, thank you for the Space Jam DVD.

17:11.020 --> 17:12.020
Some guy named Alex.

17:12.020 --> 17:13.020
Oh, Jeremy.

17:13.020 --> 17:14.020
It was Jeremy, wasn't it?

17:14.020 --> 17:15.020
Jeremy.

17:15.020 --> 17:18.020
I'm holding a Space Jam DVD with a cigar post.

17:18.020 --> 17:20.020
This is Jeremy on it.

17:20.020 --> 17:22.020
I have neither met nor heard of any of this.

17:22.020 --> 17:23.020
I don't know what's going on.

17:23.020 --> 17:27.020
How did I get Alex out of Jeremy?

17:27.020 --> 17:30.020
And I'm making fun of my girlfriend for making cakes.

17:30.020 --> 17:32.020
All I do is destroy lives.

17:32.020 --> 17:33.020
Wait, wait, wait.

17:33.020 --> 17:34.020
So what are we supposed to do?

17:34.020 --> 17:35.020
Who's Jeremy?

17:35.020 --> 17:36.020
Jeremy, are you here?

17:36.020 --> 17:37.020
All right.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.020
Alex, stand up.

17:38.020 --> 17:39.020
You won a DVD.

17:39.020 --> 17:40.020
No, I'm kidding.

17:40.020 --> 17:41.020
Oh, Jeremy.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.020
You kept calling me on that other show.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.020
Right.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.020
Weird.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.020
I don't know.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.020
There must be some dot in my head that's connected to Jeremy.

17:47.020 --> 17:48.020
Wait, so this is a gift to Dan?

17:48.020 --> 17:49.020
No.

17:49.020 --> 17:52.020
It's a person who was talking about it on the other show.

17:52.020 --> 17:55.020
You're supposed to do the show.

17:55.020 --> 17:56.020
Oh, give it to her?

17:56.020 --> 17:57.020
Yeah.

17:57.020 --> 17:58.020
Oh, who was that girl?

17:58.020 --> 18:01.020
Who was the girl that came up and loved Space Jam?

18:01.020 --> 18:02.020
It was your favorite movie.

18:02.020 --> 18:03.020
That was days ago.

18:03.020 --> 18:05.020
I want to say Lizette.

18:05.020 --> 18:07.020
No, that was yes, though.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.020
She's not here, is she?

18:09.020 --> 18:10.020
I think it was...

18:10.020 --> 18:13.020
There was a Space Jam apologist among you people.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.020
So, she'll turn up.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.020
All right.

18:15.020 --> 18:17.020
Well, Jeremy, you brought this for her?

18:17.020 --> 18:19.020
Well, I brought it for the show.

18:19.020 --> 18:21.020
Are you trying to fuck...

18:21.020 --> 18:23.020
Space Jam, man.

18:23.020 --> 18:27.020
This is the most elaborate come-on I've ever seen in my life.

18:27.020 --> 18:28.020
Well, then.

18:28.020 --> 18:30.020
He's trying to fuck Harmontown.

18:30.020 --> 18:31.020
He's Goldberg-ing.

18:31.020 --> 18:34.020
Adam, hey, Adam, are your brothers okay?

18:34.020 --> 18:36.020
They're in Boston, right?

18:36.020 --> 18:37.020
Yeah.

18:37.020 --> 18:38.020
All right.

18:38.020 --> 18:42.020
But don't pop the quirk on all the Boston talk.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.020
I want to bring up Camille and talk about it.

18:44.020 --> 18:47.020
Adam Goldberg, everybody.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.020
All right.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.020
First things first.

18:50.020 --> 18:52.020
There's a giant Velcro...

18:52.020 --> 18:53.020
Back brace.

18:53.020 --> 18:54.020
Back brace, okay.

18:54.020 --> 18:55.020
It gets attached to something.

18:55.020 --> 18:56.020
What happened?

18:56.020 --> 18:57.020
Yeah.

18:57.020 --> 18:59.020
You know how I kept saying I had a job

18:59.020 --> 19:01.020
and I wasn't going to come to Harmontown anymore?

19:01.020 --> 19:02.020
Yeah, yeah.

19:02.020 --> 19:05.020
Well, one of those is true and one of those is false.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.020
You're on the false one.

19:07.020 --> 19:10.020
You're like both Dory's and the Labyrinth.

19:10.020 --> 19:12.020
The false one is you not coming here anymore.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.020
Yeah.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.020
All right.

19:14.020 --> 19:17.020
But I didn't lose my job because I had workman's comp

19:17.020 --> 19:18.020
and didn't get injured.

19:18.020 --> 19:19.020
That was a tortured sentence.

19:19.020 --> 19:21.020
I also had a true false.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.020
My brothers are fine.

19:23.020 --> 19:30.020
My college went into lockdown and we had domestic terrorism

19:30.020 --> 19:34.020
in my fair city, Boston, which I'm not going to talk about

19:34.020 --> 19:36.020
until Camille gets here.

19:36.020 --> 19:39.020
Your role, not mine.

19:39.020 --> 19:42.020
Were your brothers able to get a hold of you?

19:42.020 --> 19:43.020
Yeah.

19:43.020 --> 19:44.020
Because it's totally locked down.

19:44.020 --> 19:47.020
Yeah, they just faced so many other ways to connect

19:47.020 --> 19:49.020
to people that aren't cell phones.

19:49.020 --> 19:50.020
Yeah, that's true, isn't it?

19:50.020 --> 19:52.020
Just got text, got an email, got all this stuff.

19:52.020 --> 19:56.020
The police have put an IM lockdown on the city of Boston.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.020
AIM is completely down.

19:58.020 --> 20:01.020
ICQ is not working due to the high call volume.

20:01.020 --> 20:03.020
Only emoticons are able to get through.

20:03.020 --> 20:05.020
People are winking at each other.

20:05.020 --> 20:10.020
I posted on Facebook today that there's a tragedy in my hometown

20:10.020 --> 20:13.020
and Facebook is like, do you want to add a smiley to this?

20:13.020 --> 20:17.020
Three people have been vaporized by bombs in a place

20:17.020 --> 20:18.020
you used to go to get coffee.

20:18.020 --> 20:20.020
How about a winky face?

20:20.020 --> 20:23.020
That's Facebook's line, not mine.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.020
I want that to be a jet pack.

20:25.020 --> 20:28.020
I want it to be a battery pack.

20:28.020 --> 20:31.020
For our listeners, Adam has taken off his gray hoodie

20:31.020 --> 20:34.020
and revealed what can only be described as a girdle.

20:34.020 --> 20:39.020
I was going to say, it's trust-like.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.020
Before you took your hoodie off,

20:41.020 --> 20:45.020
I was about to ask you how you stay so thin.

20:45.020 --> 20:46.020
Running from bombs.

20:46.020 --> 20:47.020
No.

20:47.020 --> 20:49.020
I can make that joke.

20:49.020 --> 20:50.020
Adam, see?

20:50.020 --> 20:51.020
That's why I...

20:51.020 --> 20:53.020
That's the one line you can't cross.

20:53.020 --> 20:54.020
Also the finish line.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.020
You can't cross.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.020
Holy shit!

20:56.020 --> 20:57.020
Hey-o!

20:57.020 --> 20:59.020
I can very...

20:59.020 --> 21:07.020
Will you please just put the pedal to the metal and do more Boston bombing jokes?

21:07.020 --> 21:10.020
Just Basie Barrett, just give it all.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.020
It's really embarrassing for me

21:12.020 --> 21:17.020
because this has been 20 years since Boston's last race riot.

21:17.020 --> 21:20.020
It's a little embarrassing history for Bostonians.

21:20.020 --> 21:23.020
Just connecting verbal dots.

21:23.020 --> 21:26.020
There's people rolling around in agony.

21:26.020 --> 21:29.020
You're just like, this word reminds me of another word.

21:29.020 --> 21:32.020
You also say Boston's...

21:32.020 --> 21:37.020
You say Boston's last race riot with the sound of inevitability for the next one.

21:37.020 --> 21:43.020
If you've seen how we've treated any athletic star who can't pass the paper bag test,

21:43.020 --> 21:50.020
you know Boston is a good place for race riot sounds like athletic race riot jokes.

21:50.020 --> 21:52.020
Now, by the time this podcast airs,

21:52.020 --> 21:55.020
you will be able to assemble that last sentence

21:55.020 --> 21:57.020
by going back several times,

21:57.020 --> 21:59.020
but I believe that you'll...

21:59.020 --> 22:02.020
Wait, are you saying you were involved in that?

22:02.020 --> 22:04.020
Yeah, it's a tragedy,

22:04.020 --> 22:07.020
but at some point, as a comedian,

22:07.020 --> 22:09.020
your brain just automatically makes terrible,

22:09.020 --> 22:12.020
jazzle-necky-and-jokes about it.

22:12.020 --> 22:14.020
You just go to the jazzle mix in Illinois.

22:14.020 --> 22:16.020
I mean, it's a tragedy,

22:16.020 --> 22:19.020
but to heap tragic comedy on top of it.

22:19.020 --> 22:24.020
Like, bombs are bad, puns are worse.

22:24.020 --> 22:28.020
I thought I'd come up here and bomb on the other...

22:28.020 --> 22:33.020
I thought I'd come up here and show that not all the bombs are in Boston.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.020
Thank you.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.020
All right, Adam Wilber.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.020
It was worth a try.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.020
Get well soon, would you?

22:44.020 --> 22:45.020
Yo.

22:46.020 --> 22:47.020
Oh, thank you.

22:47.020 --> 22:50.020
Gentlemen, just compliment my haircut.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.020
That was very pleasant.

22:51.020 --> 22:54.020
Thank you, sir. You're not so bad yourself.

22:54.020 --> 22:56.020
That was an interesting social phenomenon.

22:56.020 --> 22:57.020
Adam Goldberg embodied it,

22:57.020 --> 22:59.020
which before the Internet,

22:59.020 --> 23:00.020
when I was a kid,

23:00.020 --> 23:06.020
I remember when this grade of national tragedy would happen,

23:06.020 --> 23:09.020
my mind goes back to the space shuttle Challenger.

23:09.020 --> 23:11.020
The next day on the playground,

23:11.020 --> 23:13.020
there's all this conversation about it,

23:13.020 --> 23:16.020
and then there's the six jokes that everybody...

23:16.020 --> 23:18.020
And they're just awful.

23:18.020 --> 23:19.020
And they're almost like...

23:19.020 --> 23:20.020
They're vicious, too.

23:20.020 --> 23:22.020
Are they vicious, or are they kind of like...

23:22.020 --> 23:24.020
Here's the thing.

23:24.020 --> 23:27.020
They're not funny enough to be okay.

23:27.020 --> 23:29.020
If you're going to tell a funny joke after 9-11,

23:29.020 --> 23:32.020
it has to be a beautifully crafted joke.

23:32.020 --> 23:34.020
Like Warren Thomas had a goodie.

23:34.020 --> 23:38.020
Well, they have to be beautifully crafted to what end, though,

23:38.020 --> 23:41.020
because no one wants to actually laugh about it.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.020
Like if Oscar Wilde said something piffy about it,

23:44.020 --> 23:45.020
people are getting blowed up.

23:45.020 --> 23:47.020
It has to create release to go like...

23:47.020 --> 23:49.020
It's not diminishing it.

23:49.020 --> 23:51.020
It's saying, like, here's the pressure valve.

23:51.020 --> 23:53.020
And just for a second, I go...

23:53.020 --> 23:55.020
There's a rodeo clown effect there.

23:55.020 --> 23:59.020
But that's not an apt metaphor,

23:59.020 --> 24:01.020
because I think we all know that rodeo clowns

24:01.020 --> 24:03.020
are like really superior,

24:03.020 --> 24:07.020
like kind of like bull handlers.

24:07.020 --> 24:09.020
Those are the real craftsmen, blah, blah, blah.

24:09.020 --> 24:11.020
There's someone raising their hand.

24:11.020 --> 24:13.020
Benign violation theory.

24:13.020 --> 24:14.020
What's that?

24:14.020 --> 24:15.020
Benign violation theory.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.020
Would you like to come up?

24:16.020 --> 24:18.020
Get the fuck up here with that, yeah.

24:18.020 --> 24:19.020
It's a town meeting.

24:19.020 --> 24:22.020
Harmontown's got new life briefs into it.

24:22.020 --> 24:25.020
Yeah, if you're going to say three words that interesting,

24:25.020 --> 24:27.020
you have to come up with it.

24:27.020 --> 24:29.020
The divine violation theory?

24:29.020 --> 24:30.020
No, no, no. Benign.

24:30.020 --> 24:31.020
Benign?

24:31.020 --> 24:32.020
Yeah.

24:32.020 --> 24:33.020
Violation theory.

24:33.020 --> 24:35.020
I think as a Harvard professor,

24:35.020 --> 24:38.020
I came up with this theory that in order for humor to be funny,

24:38.020 --> 24:41.020
it has to be benign and deviant.

24:41.020 --> 24:44.020
If it doesn't fulfill both of those things, it isn't funny.

24:44.020 --> 24:47.020
Because if it's not benign, you see it as a threat.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.020
Right.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.020
And if it's not deviant, it's boring.

24:50.020 --> 24:51.020
Deviant in which way?

24:51.020 --> 24:53.020
Deviant as in...

24:53.020 --> 24:56.020
From the accepted path.

24:56.020 --> 24:59.020
So can you give us a, for instance, is there a...

24:59.020 --> 25:01.020
Can you pull one out?

25:01.020 --> 25:03.020
And in the case...

25:03.020 --> 25:05.020
So to continue this theory,

25:05.020 --> 25:08.020
I think we can also benign, but deviant things are easier to do

25:08.020 --> 25:12.020
when they're not in the face of something as sobering

25:12.020 --> 25:14.020
as a national tragedy.

25:14.020 --> 25:17.020
And that is why when these very serious things happen

25:17.020 --> 25:20.020
that everyone can agree are very serious and painful,

25:20.020 --> 25:22.020
actually the worst kind of...

25:22.020 --> 25:25.020
And when I say worst, I don't mean the most caustic,

25:25.020 --> 25:30.020
the most tough crowd with Colin Quinney.

25:30.020 --> 25:34.020
I mean the dumbest, the fozibarriest,

25:34.020 --> 25:37.020
like, punniest, dumbest kind of jokes come out

25:37.020 --> 25:40.020
because in order to prove that they're benign

25:40.020 --> 25:46.020
in the face of flesh being torn and the unignorable stink

25:46.020 --> 25:49.020
of political motivation in the air

25:49.020 --> 25:52.020
and not to mention the political motivation

25:52.020 --> 25:55.020
that's going to be cultivated from it.

25:55.020 --> 26:01.020
In order to be benign, you have to be pretty stupid.

26:01.020 --> 26:05.020
The joke has to be just dumb as bricks.

26:05.020 --> 26:08.020
Well, let's consider everybody loves Raymond.

26:08.020 --> 26:11.020
Not funny to most of us, right?

26:11.020 --> 26:14.020
I've actually never seen an episode of it, I don't know.

26:14.020 --> 26:17.020
Well, there is a demographic that sees his humor

26:17.020 --> 26:19.020
as deviating from the norm.

26:19.020 --> 26:21.020
Yeah.

26:21.020 --> 26:24.020
Let's all pray for them tonight.

26:27.020 --> 26:30.020
You did it. That was benign and deviant.

26:30.020 --> 26:32.020
You did it.

26:32.020 --> 26:34.020
I'm sorry, continue. I didn't mean to derail you.

26:34.020 --> 26:37.020
No, no, that was the only example I could think about.

26:37.020 --> 26:39.020
I'm sorry.

26:39.020 --> 26:41.020
Well, wait, no, but it seems like you were building to a point.

26:41.020 --> 26:43.020
No, no, no, no.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.020
You're just saying that it's a contextual thing.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.020
It's a subjective thing.

26:47.020 --> 26:50.020
To my mom, deviation is like not kneeling

26:50.020 --> 26:53.020
and my mom doesn't kneel anywhere.

26:53.020 --> 26:57.020
To my mythical mom, to grandma.

26:57.020 --> 26:59.020
Yeah, there's no joke that you could say

26:59.020 --> 27:01.020
that would be funny to everybody across the board

27:01.020 --> 27:03.020
in the face of a crisis.

27:03.020 --> 27:05.020
What was your name, sir?

27:05.020 --> 27:07.020
Okay, Bill. Well, let's thank Bill

27:07.020 --> 27:09.020
because we got so much things. Thank you, Bill.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.020
All right.

27:11.020 --> 27:15.020
It's the theory of benign deviance.

27:15.020 --> 27:17.020
I mean, yeah.

27:17.020 --> 27:20.020
Yeah, like, I think that's interesting

27:20.020 --> 27:22.020
because the jokes get dumber

27:22.020 --> 27:27.020
when the tragedy is unmistakable.

27:27.020 --> 27:31.020
And, you know, that theory, such as it is a theory.

27:31.020 --> 27:34.020
I want to say this. By no means do I want this to be funny.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.020
It's not a joke. I'm not saying it's a joke.

27:36.020 --> 27:38.020
I do not want a joke as a response to this.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.020
But there are people when you watch the footage

27:40.020 --> 27:43.020
of the marathon runners coming across the finish line.

27:43.020 --> 27:45.020
Some of them are just coming across the finish line

27:45.020 --> 27:47.020
when things go boom.

27:47.020 --> 27:49.020
And for a split second, their hands are still in the air.

27:49.020 --> 27:51.020
They don't know if that's fireworks going on.

27:51.020 --> 27:53.020
They don't know what the fuck is going on.

27:53.020 --> 27:55.020
Other people are in front of it. They see debris.

27:55.020 --> 27:57.020
They're running for the other side of the street.

27:57.020 --> 27:59.020
But also, there are people that are probably going to finish

27:59.020 --> 28:02.020
in an hour, like they've been running for three or four hours.

28:02.020 --> 28:04.020
It seems like, sorry, that three or four hours that you ran,

28:04.020 --> 28:07.020
like the marathon is over.

28:07.020 --> 28:11.020
That trickles back along a huge route, like a mile-long thing.

28:11.020 --> 28:13.020
It's a very weird thing to go on.

28:13.020 --> 28:15.020
Wait, how do you mean? What do you mean?

28:15.020 --> 28:17.020
There's going to be somebody that's just going to,

28:17.020 --> 28:19.020
at some point you're running and it's going to stop you.

28:19.020 --> 28:21.020
The marathon's over.

28:21.020 --> 28:23.020
Somebody blew up the finish line.

28:23.020 --> 28:25.020
The experience of...

28:25.020 --> 28:27.020
Yeah, I hadn't even thought about that.

28:27.020 --> 28:31.020
The subjective experience of a person who is a mile from...

28:31.020 --> 28:33.020
Doing this thing that...

28:33.020 --> 28:35.020
Who has run 22 and a half miles.

28:35.020 --> 28:37.020
And they have every right and reason to believe

28:37.020 --> 28:40.020
that what they're undergoing is this cataclysmic experience.

28:40.020 --> 28:42.020
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that.

28:42.020 --> 28:44.020
There's people that, your minds are wobbly.

28:44.020 --> 28:46.020
Your legs are wobbly.

28:46.020 --> 28:48.020
I think it was a guy that falls down in that footage.

28:48.020 --> 28:51.020
In my mind, I don't know. It didn't look like he was hit.

28:51.020 --> 28:54.020
It just looks like people's legs are about to give at that moment anyway.

28:54.020 --> 28:56.020
And he heard this big shock.

28:56.020 --> 28:58.020
I don't know if it was he or she, actually.

28:58.020 --> 29:00.020
And somebody just kind of tumbled to the ground.

29:00.020 --> 29:03.020
Well, I will say the thing that you said you're not saying,

29:03.020 --> 29:05.020
which is interesting to me.

29:05.020 --> 29:07.020
I'll be the bad guy and talk about this.

29:07.020 --> 29:10.020
Because I remembered 9-11.

29:10.020 --> 29:13.020
And I remember this.

29:13.020 --> 29:16.020
Please appreciate my candor and don't punish me

29:16.020 --> 29:19.020
for communicating something about human psychology.

29:19.020 --> 29:21.020
Because the easiest thing in the world for me

29:21.020 --> 29:24.020
would be to not share this with you and be a good person.

29:24.020 --> 29:28.020
But the year that 9-11 happened,

29:28.020 --> 29:31.020
there were Emmys same as every year.

29:31.020 --> 29:35.020
Only the year that 9-11 happened, because there was 9-11,

29:35.020 --> 29:38.020
the Emmys were downplayed.

29:38.020 --> 29:41.020
There was no red carpet, for instance.

29:41.020 --> 29:43.020
It's funny how that national psychology happens.

29:43.020 --> 29:45.020
It's like, yeah, I guess it makes sense.

29:45.020 --> 29:46.020
Like, what are we supposed to do?

29:46.020 --> 29:48.020
9-11 just happened.

29:48.020 --> 29:51.020
Let's not roll out. Let's not watch Jennifer Aniston

29:51.020 --> 29:53.020
talk about what she's wearing.

29:53.020 --> 29:56.020
Not because it has anything to do with anything,

29:56.020 --> 29:59.020
but just because it just doesn't seem right.

29:59.020 --> 30:01.020
And I agree with that.

30:01.020 --> 30:03.020
It's odd.

30:03.020 --> 30:06.020
And yet, I live in this universe where it's like,

30:06.020 --> 30:10.020
that's the most important thing in the world, the Emmys.

30:10.020 --> 30:15.020
And my mind went there when I thought about all the writers

30:15.020 --> 30:18.020
who were nominated and not nominated

30:18.020 --> 30:20.020
and nominated hoping to win

30:20.020 --> 30:22.020
or not having a chance to win.

30:22.020 --> 30:26.020
And I'm just thinking about the lives building to this point

30:26.020 --> 30:33.020
and then this 9-11 thing, like making their Emmys like not a thing.

30:33.020 --> 30:36.020
I was just thinking of like, it's not a proud thing.

30:36.020 --> 30:39.020
It's just like humanity consists of two things.

30:39.020 --> 30:43.020
It consists of a big throng of gelatinous,

30:43.020 --> 30:45.020
like societal collective.

30:45.020 --> 30:48.020
And it exists of all these little remarkable little snowflakes.

30:48.020 --> 30:50.020
Also, their own little egos and their own little motivations.

30:50.020 --> 30:53.020
The motivation was for the people or persons that did this thing.

30:53.020 --> 31:00.020
What a fucking crappy thing to do is bomb the stands at the finish line of a race.

31:00.020 --> 31:03.020
Where it's going to almost certainly be friends and family.

31:03.020 --> 31:06.020
Like people that mean nobody any fucking harm at all.

31:06.020 --> 31:08.020
Where are you gonna...

31:08.020 --> 31:11.020
I mean, I just like...

31:11.020 --> 31:14.020
I don't know why I'm having that.

31:14.020 --> 31:16.020
It's another funny thing that I wanted to talk about.

31:16.020 --> 31:18.020
I was standing at the foot of Aaron's bed,

31:18.020 --> 31:21.020
laid up with her, she's gonna take antibiotics and not come to the show.

31:21.020 --> 31:25.020
And she mentioned Boston and I was up the door.

31:25.020 --> 31:27.020
I was like, so nobody knows what's going on.

31:27.020 --> 31:32.020
And I suddenly realized that I had an opinion.

31:32.020 --> 31:36.020
I'm telling you, I'm completely sealed off from the entire thing.

31:36.020 --> 31:39.020
I could tell you in 15 seconds,

31:39.020 --> 31:41.020
everything that I've actually heard about this,

31:41.020 --> 31:43.020
because even in the green room I was telling people don't,

31:43.020 --> 31:47.020
because I think it's actually weird that I was in a bubble today

31:47.020 --> 31:52.020
and I only know multiple bombs went off at the finish line of the Boston Marathon

31:52.020 --> 31:56.020
and scores hundreds of people are horribly injured

31:56.020 --> 31:58.020
and that there's all kinds of gore all over the internet

31:58.020 --> 32:01.020
and that three people are confirmed dead and one of them's a kid.

32:01.020 --> 32:04.020
So I know all that and I know that everybody's trying to figure out

32:04.020 --> 32:06.020
what the fuck happened and that there's a huge blackout,

32:06.020 --> 32:10.020
that cell phones are blacked out because cell phones can be used to activate bombs.

32:10.020 --> 32:14.020
And then I found out in the green room that there's more bombs.

32:14.020 --> 32:17.020
But I want to bring Camille up in a second because he specifically,

32:17.020 --> 32:20.020
he was the opposite of me today.

32:20.020 --> 32:24.020
He was on Twitter and he was telling me before the show

32:24.020 --> 32:28.020
about how his subjective truth was changing every 30 minutes.

32:28.020 --> 32:33.020
But I just wanted to say one thing that I thought was so strange psychologically

32:33.020 --> 32:37.020
as I was standing at the foot of our bed about to leave for the show

32:37.020 --> 32:42.020
and Aaron mentioned something about Boston and I must have said something like,

32:42.020 --> 32:44.020
do they know? Do they know who did it yet?

32:44.020 --> 32:46.020
And she's like, no.

32:46.020 --> 32:52.020
And I said something like, I don't know, this doesn't seem very al-Qaeda-ish.

32:52.020 --> 32:55.020
And I'm like, what am I, Bruce Wayne now?

32:55.020 --> 32:59.020
Who the fuck do I, what am I talking about?

32:59.020 --> 33:01.020
I just think that's such a funny thing.

33:01.020 --> 33:04.020
I had to turn the news off because in that whirlwind,

33:04.020 --> 33:07.020
right after a big event happens, it's an earthquake or it's a robbery

33:07.020 --> 33:11.020
or Charlie Sheen makes a phone call or whatever.

33:11.020 --> 33:14.020
Nobody has any facts, so it's a lot of allege.

33:14.020 --> 33:18.020
But then in my brain immediately without any like five seconds

33:18.020 --> 33:22.020
and my brain chemistry is immediately I'm Val Kilmer sitting in front of a bank of computer.

33:22.020 --> 33:24.020
This isn't the Riddler's style.

33:24.020 --> 33:30.020
Why am I on the case? Why is my brain on the case at all?

33:30.020 --> 33:32.020
Dumb, stupid.

33:32.020 --> 33:35.020
Why isn't your brain not on the case?

33:35.020 --> 33:38.020
But why in this comic book world?

33:38.020 --> 33:40.020
Why isn't my brain on the case of who can I help?

33:40.020 --> 33:42.020
Who do you think did it?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.020
I'm not being glib again.

33:44.020 --> 33:48.020
If you had to guess right now, what do you think is the motive or are the people responsible?

33:48.020 --> 33:52.020
And I'm not being, I mean, and Erin said this in response,

33:52.020 --> 33:56.020
she said, she said kind of like she was intrigued by the thought presence

33:56.020 --> 34:02.020
of like, because it's too specific, you know, it's too, it's like, what, you are,

34:02.020 --> 34:04.020
we should bring Camille up.

34:04.020 --> 34:06.020
I think we want to talk to him about this.

34:06.020 --> 34:19.020
I didn't want to go too much further down this road because I feel like, I, I, I, I, all of a sudden,

34:19.020 --> 34:23.020
the human mind is incredible.

34:23.020 --> 34:28.020
I mean, we're cavemen that were able to create stories out of the fact that we live and die.

34:28.020 --> 34:33.020
In a vacuum, we do what cheetahs and giraffes and mosquitoes do.

34:33.020 --> 34:36.020
We come into a world, we realize we're in it, and then we go away.

34:36.020 --> 34:43.020
But unlike giraffes and cheetahs and mosquitoes, in the span of time that we're here,

34:43.020 --> 34:46.020
we go, oh, you hear that thunder?

34:46.020 --> 34:48.020
That thunder is Zeus.

34:48.020 --> 34:50.020
He's been rollerskating again.

34:50.020 --> 34:52.020
And the kids go, what's the rollerskating?

34:52.020 --> 34:54.020
And we go, well, rollerskating is what happens when it's done.

34:54.020 --> 34:56.020
And we just fill our heads.

34:56.020 --> 35:02.020
Our brains branch out and we create beauty and poetry and dancing and festivals

35:02.020 --> 35:05.020
and, and, and we reach out, we touch each other, we save each other's lives,

35:05.020 --> 35:11.020
we take bullets for each other, but we also, we go like, well, you know, black people.

35:11.020 --> 35:15.020
You know, you put one on a drive-thru and you know, you know, we have that.

35:15.020 --> 35:17.020
That's a new one.

35:17.020 --> 35:20.020
That same computer is constantly.

35:20.020 --> 35:22.020
I didn't know about black Netherlands drive-thru.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.020
You've never been behind a black person in a drive-thru.

35:24.020 --> 35:28.020
What are they doing?

35:28.020 --> 35:30.020
What are the black people doing in drive-thru?

35:30.020 --> 35:32.020
I wish I could tell you, but we got so much to do tonight.

35:32.020 --> 35:33.020
What?

35:33.020 --> 35:34.020
No tangents. No tangents.

35:34.020 --> 35:36.020
Shoot it next week.

35:36.020 --> 35:41.020
It's interesting because the mic stand broke off.

35:41.020 --> 35:45.020
First of all, to answer your question, I hope it's a crazy white guy

35:45.020 --> 35:49.020
or like an Asian lady because we haven't seen them do

35:49.020 --> 35:51.020
just for the novelty of it.

35:51.020 --> 35:56.020
And also I just don't want it to be a brown person again.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.020
I really don't.

35:58.020 --> 36:01.020
What horse do you have on this race?

36:01.020 --> 36:05.020
I just want any of the horses that are not brown.

36:05.020 --> 36:08.020
I don't know, are they winning the race? What's going on?

36:08.020 --> 36:14.020
First of all, my race riot puns have been taken.

36:14.020 --> 36:17.020
Yeah, so that's a real thing if you are...

36:17.020 --> 36:19.020
Well, here's the thing.

36:19.020 --> 36:22.020
If it's like a crazy white guy, then it's just a crazy white guy.

36:22.020 --> 36:26.020
If it's a crazy brown guy, then it's a fucking conspiracy and all.

36:26.020 --> 36:28.020
It turns this whole thing.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.020
I just want it to be not...

36:30.020 --> 36:34.020
I was thinking how frustrating it would be if you were just like a McVeigh,

36:34.020 --> 36:40.020
a unabomber, manifesto kind of crazy guy who just happens to be from Saudi Arabia.

36:40.020 --> 36:41.020
He'd be so...

36:41.020 --> 36:43.020
Because everyone's like, oh yeah, of course he's Al-Qaeda.

36:43.020 --> 36:46.020
He's like, no, I've got my own thing going on.

36:46.020 --> 36:48.020
He's like, read my manifesto.

36:48.020 --> 36:50.020
You mean the Quran? No.

36:50.020 --> 36:52.020
I don't even... I'm an atheist.

36:52.020 --> 36:54.020
No, my mom gave it to me.

36:54.020 --> 36:56.020
She gave it to me. I'm not religious.

36:56.020 --> 36:58.020
I'm just like, honey bees are going to take over the hummingbirds.

36:58.020 --> 37:01.020
But I'm way crazier than you think I am.

37:01.020 --> 37:05.020
This is not institutionalized craziness.

37:05.020 --> 37:08.020
But if you're a crazy manifesto guy that lives in Saudi Arabia,

37:08.020 --> 37:11.020
but you're also lazy, you're like, I'm on Easy Street.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.020
I walk right into this one.

37:13.020 --> 37:15.020
You know what this vein of gold is?

37:15.020 --> 37:18.020
It's benign and deviant.

37:18.020 --> 37:22.020
It's a safe pocket away from anyone mistaking us

37:22.020 --> 37:25.020
for not, you know, having our prayers in grief

37:25.020 --> 37:27.020
with the families of the loved ones.

37:27.020 --> 37:29.020
Sorry, I ruined it.

37:29.020 --> 37:31.020
But it makes sense what you're saying.

37:31.020 --> 37:33.020
What Adam was doing, when you make like base jokes

37:33.020 --> 37:36.020
when something big, when you perceive to be big happens,

37:36.020 --> 37:39.020
it's because you're trying to make sense of the world.

37:39.020 --> 37:41.020
It's the same as saying that thunder is loose.

37:41.020 --> 37:43.020
You're trying to put structure on it.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.020
So if something happens that you can't understand,

37:45.020 --> 37:47.020
well, if you make a joke about it, then it becomes smaller,

37:47.020 --> 37:49.020
something you can process, something you can have.

37:49.020 --> 37:52.020
And here's the thing that I think is really interesting about that.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.020
Well, everything's interesting about it.

37:54.020 --> 37:56.020
Why do I have to point out one thing that's interesting about it?

37:56.020 --> 37:58.020
But the thing that captivates me about it

37:58.020 --> 38:02.020
is that it's a channel to accountability.

38:02.020 --> 38:06.020
A six-year-old on a playground making a joke about Liberace dying of AIDS

38:06.020 --> 38:10.020
or what Rock Hudson, when I was a kid, it was like AIDS was being invented.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.020
And then there were all these Rock Hudson died

38:12.020 --> 38:15.020
and there were all these weird jokes about, you know,

38:15.020 --> 38:20.020
walking in AIDS and, you know, it was like cooties became a real fun thing

38:20.020 --> 38:22.020
and insensitivity ran rampant.

38:22.020 --> 38:24.020
And then the space shuttle Challenger, when I was 12, blew up.

38:24.020 --> 38:26.020
And I'm just like, what does NASA stand for?

38:26.020 --> 38:30.020
A variety of hilarious things that all have to do with not appreciating the fact

38:30.020 --> 38:32.020
that seven people blew up.

38:32.020 --> 38:37.020
But the interesting thing about that is that it all,

38:37.020 --> 38:41.020
knocking on wood, not walking under a ladder,

38:41.020 --> 38:46.020
cats crossing your path, it's superstition and religion and benevolence

38:46.020 --> 38:52.020
and hatred, cruelty, politics, YouTube comment sections.

38:52.020 --> 38:58.020
Humanity, unlike cheetahs and giraffes and eel and mosquitoes,

38:58.020 --> 39:03.020
we reach these tendrils out into a completely chaotic universe

39:03.020 --> 39:08.020
that for all intents and purposes, for every signal that it sends to us,

39:08.020 --> 39:10.020
doesn't give a fuck what happens.

39:10.020 --> 39:13.020
You can't control when it rains.

39:13.020 --> 39:15.020
You don't know who's going to get cancer.

39:15.020 --> 39:20.020
You don't know why Ugg dropped dead and Blug Blug didn't.

39:20.020 --> 39:25.020
But we insist upon reaching out into the world

39:25.020 --> 39:29.020
and I don't think we characterize it by going like,

39:29.020 --> 39:31.020
oh, we're afraid of everything we don't understand

39:31.020 --> 39:33.020
so we try to make sense of it.

39:33.020 --> 39:38.020
Okay, granted, but the flip side of that coin trying to make sense of the unknown

39:38.020 --> 39:41.020
is a lot easier to hide from the unknown.

39:41.020 --> 39:44.020
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

39:44.020 --> 39:46.020
No, I'm not correcting you on anything.

39:46.020 --> 39:47.020
I'm not arguing.

39:47.020 --> 39:49.020
I'm just like, this is amazing.

39:49.020 --> 39:57.020
When a little kid makes a joke about the space shuttle blowing up,

39:57.020 --> 39:59.020
that little kid doesn't know it,

39:59.020 --> 40:03.020
but his unconscious brain is reaching out into the world

40:03.020 --> 40:07.020
and claiming responsibility for seven people blowing up in a space shuttle.

40:07.020 --> 40:13.020
That little child is apotheosizing, if that's a word.

40:13.020 --> 40:15.020
He's becoming God.

40:15.020 --> 40:17.020
He's going like, well, this thing happened

40:17.020 --> 40:19.020
and here's what I got to say about it.

40:19.020 --> 40:21.020
Doodoo's and butt butts.

40:21.020 --> 40:27.020
We are, we are, and so talk about your experience on Twitter today.

40:27.020 --> 40:34.020
Oh, it was just weird because I, so I was driving back from Big Sur today

40:34.020 --> 40:37.020
and I don't know.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.020
What a life.

40:38.020 --> 40:40.020
Yeah, geez, it's rough.

40:40.020 --> 40:43.020
I was driving back and just sort of like,

40:43.020 --> 40:45.020
you were flying back on a private jet,

40:45.020 --> 40:47.020
you were driving back like any old asshole.

40:47.020 --> 40:49.020
Yeah, but he's probably like...

40:49.020 --> 40:51.020
He's kind of gone to little sir.

40:51.020 --> 40:52.020
He knows what he's doing.

40:52.020 --> 40:56.020
I just wanted to drop that I can afford some of the hotels in Big Sur right now.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.020
And guests.

40:57.020 --> 40:59.020
Well, but it...

40:59.020 --> 41:01.020
Even the trees are bigger out there.

41:01.020 --> 41:03.020
Everything's awesome.

41:03.020 --> 41:04.020
It's like heaven on earth.

41:04.020 --> 41:06.020
So I'm driving back.

41:06.020 --> 41:08.020
It really wants me to...

41:08.020 --> 41:09.020
It's a big story.

41:09.020 --> 41:12.020
Like the first thing I wanted to do is write a movie about a guy wanting to write a movie

41:12.020 --> 41:14.020
about writing a write a movie.

41:14.020 --> 41:16.020
This feels like every shitty meta.

41:16.020 --> 41:18.020
Yeah, there's no perspective there.

41:18.020 --> 41:20.020
It's all like we are clearly...

41:20.020 --> 41:22.020
All I want to know is I want to be a writer.

41:22.020 --> 41:23.020
Yeah.

41:23.020 --> 41:25.020
Look at all these trees and dirt.

41:25.020 --> 41:27.020
I think it ties in well to what you were saying is that part of,

41:27.020 --> 41:30.020
I think what we, because our brains are so smart,

41:30.020 --> 41:33.020
we're trying, it's all about power and control.

41:33.020 --> 41:36.020
And control is predictability saying why thunder is happening,

41:36.020 --> 41:38.020
it's because Zeus is angry.

41:38.020 --> 41:39.020
Why did certain things happen?

41:39.020 --> 41:40.020
Because these other things happen.

41:40.020 --> 41:41.020
So I was on Twitter.

41:41.020 --> 41:43.020
I didn't have access to like radio.

41:43.020 --> 41:46.020
So the only thing I had was like just refreshing Twitter over and over and see.

41:46.020 --> 41:49.020
And like you would see like something small would get reported

41:49.020 --> 41:51.020
and then someone would hear it.

41:51.020 --> 41:54.020
And then because it's hundreds of people on Twitter repeating it,

41:54.020 --> 41:55.020
it would become the truth.

41:55.020 --> 41:59.020
So at some point it was that some Saudi national was the guy.

41:59.020 --> 42:02.020
And so then that became the truth for like a half hour.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.020
I was like, fuck my people are at it again, you know.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.020
And that became the truth.

42:06.020 --> 42:08.020
But it's also, that's also part of people being like,

42:08.020 --> 42:10.020
it would, I think most people are like,

42:10.020 --> 42:14.020
it would make most sense if it is al-Qaeda.

42:14.020 --> 42:16.020
Then it's a threat we already have.

42:16.020 --> 42:18.020
We know what that is.

42:18.020 --> 42:20.020
It sucks, but that's what that is.

42:20.020 --> 42:23.020
So people, there was like a sense of relief almost.

42:23.020 --> 42:25.020
People were like tweeting that because I said,

42:25.020 --> 42:26.020
I hope it's a white guy.

42:26.020 --> 42:29.020
Just because I think that's inherently not politicized.

42:29.020 --> 42:32.020
And people would respond to me like sort of like,

42:32.020 --> 42:35.020
like bragging that like, look, it's one of your people.

42:35.020 --> 42:37.020
Like I got a ton of people.

42:37.020 --> 42:39.020
What do you mean?

42:39.020 --> 42:41.020
I said, I hope it's a crazy white guy.

42:41.020 --> 42:43.020
Most people understood what I said.

42:43.020 --> 42:47.020
And so you entered into an unspoken almost like,

42:47.020 --> 42:49.020
like if you're watching The Bachelor with somebody and going like,

42:49.020 --> 42:52.020
I hope he gives the flower to Cynthia and sort of Veronica.

42:52.020 --> 42:54.020
There's just like an automatic kind of, I told you.

42:54.020 --> 42:57.020
Yeah. A lot of people are like, well, sorry to burst your bubble.

42:57.020 --> 43:00.020
I swear someone said that and then linked me.

43:00.020 --> 43:03.020
I'm like, are you, is there a glee that it's,

43:03.020 --> 43:05.020
do you think it's like a guy from the Middle East?

43:05.020 --> 43:08.020
And I think there really is a little bit because that's a known threat.

43:08.020 --> 43:11.020
And that's a way to compartmentalize and control the situation

43:11.020 --> 43:13.020
or at least have some power over it is no like,

43:13.020 --> 43:15.020
Oh, we know these are the bad guys.

43:15.020 --> 43:18.020
It's Dr. Doom again. You know, that's why like people,

43:18.020 --> 43:21.020
even in movies, like superhero movies,

43:21.020 --> 43:23.020
people like when it's like Riddler or whatever,

43:23.020 --> 43:25.020
they don't like like, who's the fuck is this new guy?

43:25.020 --> 43:29.020
I want it to be a new Dr. Doom because I don't want,

43:29.020 --> 43:32.020
I don't want to live in a world where, I mean,

43:32.020 --> 43:35.020
as I was, we're speaking about the cartoon parts of our brains

43:35.020 --> 43:36.020
that are thinking these things.

43:36.020 --> 43:38.020
First of all, why do we think we know things?

43:38.020 --> 43:40.020
Second of all, why do we want certain things over other things?

43:40.020 --> 43:41.020
That's what's interesting to me.

43:41.020 --> 43:44.020
Given no, none of us are in forensics.

43:44.020 --> 43:46.020
None of us are in politics.

43:46.020 --> 43:49.020
None of us are like, but we all have opinions.

43:49.020 --> 43:51.020
We all have theories.

43:51.020 --> 43:53.020
And as I was saying,

43:53.020 --> 43:57.020
I'm like a weird guinea pig in this experiment

43:57.020 --> 44:00.020
because I knew nothing was exposed to nothing.

44:00.020 --> 44:02.020
Well, what's interesting in nothing?

44:02.020 --> 44:05.020
And immediately had opinions and leads

44:05.020 --> 44:07.020
and where you can start your investigation.

44:07.020 --> 44:10.020
The Joker usually leaves a clue at the scene.

44:10.020 --> 44:12.020
There were no cards found.

44:12.020 --> 44:14.020
So it wasn't him, but it's true.

44:14.020 --> 44:16.020
And my girlfriend called me on it and said like,

44:16.020 --> 44:20.020
because it would be weird if Al-Qaeda loved,

44:20.020 --> 44:24.020
like was so into something as specific as a Boston Marathon.

44:24.020 --> 44:26.020
And I was like, yeah, yeah, I guess.

44:26.020 --> 44:29.020
What am I, like an Al-Qaeda expert?

44:29.020 --> 44:30.020
A manhunter?

44:30.020 --> 44:32.020
I'm in the mind of my enemy.

44:32.020 --> 44:36.020
Two things, one, it doesn't seem like their style,

44:36.020 --> 44:37.020
whatever that is.

44:37.020 --> 44:38.020
Two.

44:38.020 --> 44:39.020
Who does it mean?

44:39.020 --> 44:43.020
Their style is airplanes going into a building that no longer exists.

44:43.020 --> 44:46.020
The scope is a little smaller unless it's got fucked up.

44:46.020 --> 44:48.020
I mean, I think it was supposed to be a bigger event than it was.

44:48.020 --> 44:52.020
Well, that's why it sucks if it's one guy who just happens to Middle Eastern

44:52.020 --> 44:54.020
who's like, I'm just going to do this one thing on mine.

44:54.020 --> 44:56.020
But the thing what you were saying, I want to say this real quick,

44:56.020 --> 45:00.020
what you knew just from the four senses is what all of us know.

45:00.020 --> 45:02.020
But if you're following the news cycle,

45:02.020 --> 45:06.020
you just like, things happen and they become truth and then it's false

45:06.020 --> 45:07.020
and then it's truth and then it's false.

45:07.020 --> 45:09.020
But all the things you said, which is like three people die,

45:09.020 --> 45:11.020
there's how many people are injured, there's where it happened,

45:11.020 --> 45:13.020
that is all we know still.

45:13.020 --> 45:14.020
That is all we know.

45:14.020 --> 45:15.020
So you don't know anything.

45:15.020 --> 45:17.020
Here's a really weird question.

45:17.020 --> 45:22.020
What's more racist?

45:22.020 --> 45:24.020
This or that?

45:24.020 --> 45:29.020
The whole audience is going to lean in imperceptibly.

45:29.020 --> 45:34.020
Is it more, are you more racist and jingoistic or whatever phrase you want to use?

45:34.020 --> 45:37.020
This is a half-year grade, you guys.

45:37.020 --> 45:43.020
If you hope it was a Middle Easterner, let's say,

45:43.020 --> 45:48.020
I'm not even going to say Al-Qaeda, let's say,

45:48.020 --> 45:53.020
or if you hope it was, as you say, a crazy white guy,

45:53.020 --> 46:01.020
as a liberal white 40-year-old guy sitting in my house in Los Angeles,

46:01.020 --> 46:06.020
my immediate hope, and this is all instinctive and I'm being honest about it,

46:06.020 --> 46:11.020
I didn't have time to connect any of these dots consciously.

46:11.020 --> 46:15.020
This is what happened in my brain chemistry when I heard the news.

46:15.020 --> 46:20.020
I hope and hope that it is a crazy white guy

46:20.020 --> 46:23.020
and I haven't asked myself yet why I hope that.

46:23.020 --> 46:25.020
Part of it is self-preservation.

46:25.020 --> 46:30.020
I want to have a kid with Aaron and I don't want my kid to grow up in a...

46:30.020 --> 46:34.020
That's your feet to kick time traveling back.

46:34.020 --> 46:36.020
He's like, please do it!

46:36.020 --> 46:38.020
Aaron made it after all.

46:38.020 --> 46:41.020
Yeah, he's saying the penicillin worked so well.

46:41.020 --> 46:43.020
Adam Goldberg applauded because he wants to have a kid

46:43.020 --> 46:48.020
that will come over to that kid's playground uninvited and swing next to him.

46:48.020 --> 46:51.020
And do puns based on the newest tragedy.

46:51.020 --> 46:53.020
I know where all the good water fountains are.

46:53.020 --> 46:57.020
The thing is, my uncle had spina bifida and he doesn't tend to go there,

46:57.020 --> 47:00.020
but pipes is pipes, I don't know.

47:00.020 --> 47:03.020
I think a crazy white guy is better.

47:03.020 --> 47:06.020
Well, a crazy white guy is clean and simple.

47:06.020 --> 47:08.020
And it makes everything feel like a David Fincher film.

47:08.020 --> 47:09.020
It's just one guy.

47:09.020 --> 47:12.020
As opposed to a conspiracy or an ideology.

47:12.020 --> 47:14.020
Adam, Adam, don't blow us up.

47:14.020 --> 47:16.020
Don't blow us up, please.

47:20.020 --> 47:22.020
But am I...

47:24.020 --> 47:28.020
Aren't I, on a deeper Noam Chomsky level,

47:28.020 --> 47:33.020
more racist and more part of the evil

47:33.020 --> 47:38.020
to hope that it wasn't the Visigoths

47:38.020 --> 47:41.020
that spit on the wall of Rome?

47:41.020 --> 47:42.020
Why do you say that?

47:42.020 --> 47:45.020
Because I want to think that they're gone.

47:45.020 --> 47:47.020
Because I don't want them in the picture.

47:47.020 --> 47:49.020
Doesn't that make me...

47:49.020 --> 47:51.020
I want to think.

47:51.020 --> 47:55.020
I don't want to raise my child, my beautiful rich white child,

47:55.020 --> 47:59.020
in a world where the Legion of Doom is still operative.

47:59.020 --> 48:01.020
Well, I think this is what it is.

48:01.020 --> 48:04.020
I think you know the Legion of Doom is still operative, right?

48:04.020 --> 48:06.020
You know there's always going to be...

48:06.020 --> 48:10.020
when you're the most prosperous country in the world.

48:10.020 --> 48:13.020
I think we all know a lot of stuff that we don't consciously deal with.

48:13.020 --> 48:14.020
Sure, sure.

48:14.020 --> 48:16.020
But I think what would be good, from my perspective,

48:16.020 --> 48:17.020
I'll tell you why.

48:17.020 --> 48:18.020
I don't know what your perspective is.

48:18.020 --> 48:20.020
My perspective, it's good if it's not a white guy,

48:20.020 --> 48:23.020
is because I remember right after 9-11 happened

48:23.020 --> 48:25.020
and like the shit that people would say to me on the street.

48:25.020 --> 48:27.020
It's a very, you know, you think about yourself,

48:27.020 --> 48:28.020
you personalize it.

48:28.020 --> 48:30.020
I don't want that stuff happening to me again.

48:30.020 --> 48:31.020
I don't want that shit happening to me.

48:31.020 --> 48:34.020
And also, if it's a white guy, it's just one white guy.

48:34.020 --> 48:38.020
If it's a brown guy, it's all the brown people are somehow accountable.

48:38.020 --> 48:40.020
That's just how it happens.

48:40.020 --> 48:42.020
That's how I see it happening on Twitter.

48:42.020 --> 48:43.020
That's just how it happens.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.020
I would see the looks.

48:44.020 --> 48:45.020
It's interesting.

48:45.020 --> 48:47.020
Like, I live in LA, I go to New York,

48:47.020 --> 48:50.020
but when I go to Ohio, I get looks.

48:50.020 --> 48:51.020
I swear.

48:51.020 --> 48:53.020
I was like, why is that guy looking at me?

48:53.020 --> 48:54.020
I'm like, oh, right.

48:54.020 --> 48:56.020
This was a look I was used to 10 years ago,

48:56.020 --> 48:58.020
but since I've moved to New York or LA,

48:58.020 --> 49:00.020
I don't get that look anymore.

49:00.020 --> 49:02.020
I wonder if it'll ever be a woman.

49:02.020 --> 49:04.020
We're just saying guy, brown guy, white guy,

49:04.020 --> 49:05.020
this guy, that guy.

49:05.020 --> 49:07.020
It's never a woman.

49:07.020 --> 49:10.020
A lot of suicide bombers are women,

49:10.020 --> 49:12.020
because they don't pat them down.

49:12.020 --> 49:13.020
This is true.

49:13.020 --> 49:14.020
I don't know why.

49:14.020 --> 49:15.020
I have a smile.

49:15.020 --> 49:18.020
It's just the only reach up to the resistance.

49:18.020 --> 49:19.020
The what?

49:19.020 --> 49:23.020
Erin said that's only to find the vagina at TSA checkpoints,

49:23.020 --> 49:26.020
because she always opts out when they tell her,

49:26.020 --> 49:28.020
I'm going to reach up to the resistance.

49:28.020 --> 49:30.020
That's what they say?

49:30.020 --> 49:32.020
When they push the resistance, I'm like,

49:32.020 --> 49:36.020
you're telling me, sister.

49:36.020 --> 49:43.020
Viva la resistanz.

49:43.020 --> 49:44.020
I don't know.

49:44.020 --> 49:45.020
It's interesting.

49:45.020 --> 49:47.020
I had a thought in my head,

49:47.020 --> 49:51.020
no, I have none of your motivations.

49:51.020 --> 49:53.020
Your subjective motivations.

49:53.020 --> 49:55.020
Yeah, which are very subjective.

49:55.020 --> 49:58.020
But I'm not saying they're noble at all.

49:58.020 --> 49:59.020
They're not noble.

49:59.020 --> 50:00.020
No, of course.

50:00.020 --> 50:03.020
Noble or not.

50:03.020 --> 50:05.020
Yeah, because I could say,

50:05.020 --> 50:07.020
well, if it's a guy that lived on Franklin,

50:07.020 --> 50:08.020
they'll close off Franklin.

50:08.020 --> 50:10.020
I won't be able to get to my haircut appointment.

50:10.020 --> 50:14.020
Yeah, there's subjective reasons.

50:14.020 --> 50:18.020
And you have a very subjective reason

50:18.020 --> 50:20.020
that I don't have that you pointed out.

50:20.020 --> 50:22.020
And beyond that though,

50:22.020 --> 50:25.020
I want to know in my white brain,

50:25.020 --> 50:27.020
why do I want it to be a white guy?

50:27.020 --> 50:29.020
And I don't think it's because I'm a hero.

50:29.020 --> 50:32.020
I think it's less of a threat if it's a white guy.

50:32.020 --> 50:34.020
Yeah, it just feels more like a comic book.

50:34.020 --> 50:36.020
It feels like a Batman movie.

50:36.020 --> 50:38.020
It's like, oh, who's this guy?

50:38.020 --> 50:41.020
People are just strapping themselves up with a bunch of shit.

50:41.020 --> 50:43.020
Everyone knows how to make a bomb.

50:43.020 --> 50:46.020
We've covered how to turn a cell phone into a weapon.

50:46.020 --> 50:48.020
Everybody knows how to do it.

50:48.020 --> 50:50.020
Anybody who's had a bad week,

50:50.020 --> 50:53.020
a giant cocksucker and blew up a bunch of people,

50:53.020 --> 50:57.020
that to me is worse than some dedicated foe that we hate.

50:57.020 --> 50:58.020
It was the penguin.

50:58.020 --> 51:00.020
And we know that we're after this organization.

51:00.020 --> 51:02.020
We can't get him, but we're trying our heart.

51:02.020 --> 51:03.020
That's one thing.

51:03.020 --> 51:06.020
But if it's just every disenfranchised lunatic out there

51:06.020 --> 51:08.020
that wants to go make a point,

51:08.020 --> 51:11.020
that's what's freaky because there's something about the fact

51:11.020 --> 51:15.020
that appears to be a couple low-level trashcan bombs

51:15.020 --> 51:19.020
that blew up 150 people or whatever.

51:19.020 --> 51:21.020
That's kind of low scope.

51:21.020 --> 51:24.020
You could go a lot bigger than that with just by being an asshole.

51:24.020 --> 51:27.020
And now we're going to, like you said earlier, Dan,

51:27.020 --> 51:32.020
it's not just the politics that go into why someone does shit like that.

51:32.020 --> 51:36.020
It's how that shapes the world we live in after this now.

51:36.020 --> 51:38.020
And everything gets a little bit funkier,

51:38.020 --> 51:40.020
a little bit more security cameras, a little bit more.

51:40.020 --> 51:42.020
Now we're all watching each other.

51:42.020 --> 51:44.020
And somebody very weirdly, but astutely pointed out today,

51:44.020 --> 51:46.020
like, look, there's cameras everywhere.

51:46.020 --> 51:48.020
It's a finish line to race.

51:48.020 --> 51:49.020
Everyone's got their phones out.

51:49.020 --> 51:51.020
They're going to be going through all that shit.

51:51.020 --> 51:53.020
And if they're going to be looking for people of different ethnicity

51:53.020 --> 51:55.020
carrying backpacks, that's everybody there.

51:55.020 --> 51:57.020
Because lots of people from all over the world

51:57.020 --> 51:59.020
have their best friend waiting at the finish line

51:59.020 --> 52:02.020
to give them a fucking power bar and some Gatorade and some shit.

52:02.020 --> 52:04.020
Well, I thought what you were going to say is

52:04.020 --> 52:06.020
if they're going to be looking for people of different ethnicity

52:06.020 --> 52:09.020
carrying backpacks, they're going to be able to focus on those people

52:09.020 --> 52:12.020
more easily than people who blended in that were wearing backpacks.

52:12.020 --> 52:14.020
But the line-up's going to be long

52:14.020 --> 52:16.020
because it's a bunch of people holding knapsacks out there

52:16.020 --> 52:17.020
and stuff like that.

52:17.020 --> 52:19.020
The other thing I want to say is that I don't want this to be

52:19.020 --> 52:20.020
a political statement at all.

52:20.020 --> 52:21.020
I really don't.

52:21.020 --> 52:23.020
And I said this on Twitter and I got a lot of shit for it.

52:23.020 --> 52:26.020
Here's also, and honestly, I'm not trying to downplay anything.

52:26.020 --> 52:28.020
Fuck Mexicans.

52:29.020 --> 52:30.020
No, no, no.

52:30.020 --> 52:31.020
You deleted that one, right?

52:31.020 --> 52:32.020
No, I did.

52:32.020 --> 52:35.020
But honestly, kind of fuck Mexicans.

52:35.020 --> 52:37.020
Like, what's a gordita?

52:37.020 --> 52:38.020
I don't get it.

52:38.020 --> 52:39.020
Like, yeah.

52:39.020 --> 52:40.020
How soft do your tacos have to get?

52:40.020 --> 52:41.020
Yeah, yeah.

52:41.020 --> 52:42.020
Choco taco?

52:42.020 --> 52:43.020
The ice cream taco?

52:43.020 --> 52:44.020
The point is to eat the crispiness.

52:44.020 --> 52:45.020
Yeah.

52:45.020 --> 52:46.020
Get your shit together.

52:46.020 --> 52:48.020
Choco is just a cone in a different shape.

52:48.020 --> 52:50.020
We're all onto you.

52:50.020 --> 52:52.020
Don't make us give Texas back.

52:52.020 --> 52:54.020
Give us some tater tots or something.

52:54.020 --> 52:55.020
You know what I mean?

52:55.020 --> 52:57.020
If it turns out to be a Mexican terrorist that did this,

52:57.020 --> 53:00.020
how does that affect the brown people's standpoint of yours?

53:00.020 --> 53:02.020
Oh, we're cool.

53:02.020 --> 53:03.020
We're, like, good.

53:03.020 --> 53:06.020
They're because of an eye shape and eyebrows and the last name.

53:06.020 --> 53:07.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:07.020 --> 53:08.020
Look how...

53:08.020 --> 53:10.020
I was going to say something horribly raising.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.020
Do it.

53:11.020 --> 53:12.020
No, no, no.

53:12.020 --> 53:15.020
No one's going to tell anybody.

53:15.020 --> 53:17.020
Anybody can hear this.

53:17.020 --> 53:21.020
Here's the one thing I want to say is that I grew up in Pakistan

53:21.020 --> 53:23.020
and the one thing Americans don't have that we had,

53:23.020 --> 53:25.020
that Americans have that we didn't have,

53:25.020 --> 53:28.020
Americans have this assumed sense of security,

53:28.020 --> 53:30.020
which is a huge privilege and it's a luxury

53:30.020 --> 53:33.020
and most of the people in the world do not have that.

53:33.020 --> 53:34.020
I know I didn't have it.

53:34.020 --> 53:38.020
And just, there were, like, bombs in Iraq today

53:38.020 --> 53:40.020
and 42 people died.

53:40.020 --> 53:42.020
And I'm not saying you make the strategy smaller,

53:42.020 --> 53:45.020
but any time you read about a bomb happening

53:45.020 --> 53:47.020
in another part of the world,

53:47.020 --> 53:50.020
try and remember how it felt here to have that happen to,

53:50.020 --> 53:52.020
with three people dying in Boston,

53:52.020 --> 53:55.020
and how that must feel for the people over there.

53:55.020 --> 53:57.020
I think that's a very important...

53:57.020 --> 53:59.020
People, yeah.

54:01.020 --> 54:03.020
Doesn't it feel weird when you get applause

54:03.020 --> 54:05.020
and then you feel like, I didn't do that for applause.

54:05.020 --> 54:08.020
I think when people, you read about bombs all the time,

54:08.020 --> 54:11.020
bombs in Syria, and it always, like, just goes off of you.

54:11.020 --> 54:13.020
You think it's just, like, some other world that's happening.

54:13.020 --> 54:14.020
But that's the world.

54:14.020 --> 54:16.020
People are living their lives there

54:16.020 --> 54:18.020
and they love their kids and they like the food

54:18.020 --> 54:20.020
and they have, you know, favorite ice cream flavors or whatever.

54:20.020 --> 54:23.020
So just remember how awful this is

54:23.020 --> 54:26.020
and even now how distant you are from it

54:26.020 --> 54:28.020
and how it happens to people all over the world.

54:28.020 --> 54:31.020
And it's like a more of a fact of life for a lot of people.

54:31.020 --> 54:32.020
Yeah, absolutely.

54:32.020 --> 54:36.020
I mean, that's, like, yeah, that is the, like, the...

54:36.020 --> 54:38.020
The fucked up thing is that when you're...

54:38.020 --> 54:41.020
When you're a fat, rich, white, 40-year-old,

54:41.020 --> 54:43.020
video game-loving, wheat-thin eatin',

54:43.020 --> 54:45.020
like, community-createin',

54:45.020 --> 54:47.020
if I could drinkin', community-createin',

54:47.020 --> 54:51.020
hangin' out, doin' your showin', guyin',

54:51.020 --> 54:54.020
like, the only time these conversations happen

54:54.020 --> 54:55.020
is when this stuff happens.

54:55.020 --> 54:57.020
And it's when this stuff happens that you think

54:57.020 --> 54:59.020
that exact thought that I do, that I go,

54:59.020 --> 55:03.020
oh, I wonder how many people, like, you know,

55:03.020 --> 55:05.020
I wonder what's going on on the planet

55:05.020 --> 55:08.020
and why this is a bigger deal.

55:08.020 --> 55:11.020
And if I chime in with that sentiment at that point,

55:11.020 --> 55:13.020
I couldn't be a bigger hypocrite because it's like,

55:13.020 --> 55:17.020
I had my chance to give a fuck about whether people lived or died

55:17.020 --> 55:18.020
and I didn't.

55:18.020 --> 55:21.020
So then, did Noam Chomsky chime in when it happens?

55:21.020 --> 55:23.020
It's like, you're the worst of both worlds

55:23.020 --> 55:28.020
because you're eating Twinkies while everyone's dyin'

55:28.020 --> 55:32.020
and then schoolchildren get shot and the thing

55:32.020 --> 55:36.020
and then if I choose to go, well, compared to what happens.

55:36.020 --> 55:37.020
Well, I mean, it's not compared to,

55:37.020 --> 55:39.020
it's not trying to downplay anything.

55:39.020 --> 55:41.020
It's just saying people who are very rotted

55:41.020 --> 55:42.020
and feeling a lot of things.

55:42.020 --> 55:44.020
And if I say this two days from now,

55:44.020 --> 55:46.020
people aren't gonna be feeling that anymore.

55:46.020 --> 55:48.020
The bubble of security will be back.

55:48.020 --> 55:51.020
If you say that today, like, what you feel right now,

55:51.020 --> 55:54.020
how raw and hurt and painful it feels,

55:54.020 --> 55:57.020
that's like a real feeling for a lot of people in the world

55:57.020 --> 55:58.020
all the time.

55:58.020 --> 55:59.020
And that's not to downplay anything.

55:59.020 --> 56:02.020
It's just because someone died somewhere else

56:02.020 --> 56:05.020
and those are bomb, doesn't mean you can't enjoy your video games.

56:05.020 --> 56:07.020
It just means, you know, just be aware.

56:07.020 --> 56:10.020
It's a big world and, you know...

56:10.020 --> 56:13.020
Yeah, well, I do think, yeah, we've entered a world where we...

56:13.020 --> 56:17.020
I'll tell you, it's gonna be a tough segue into D&D after this.

56:17.020 --> 56:19.020
But a welcome one.

56:19.020 --> 56:20.020
I don't think so at all.

56:20.020 --> 56:23.020
I think if you listen to last week's recording,

56:23.020 --> 56:25.020
you're like, well, there's an example of nothing going wrong

56:25.020 --> 56:27.020
in the world and nothing being sensitive

56:27.020 --> 56:29.020
and it's just a shit piece of shit show.

56:29.020 --> 56:31.020
I thought the show was good.

56:31.020 --> 56:32.020
Did you think the show was bad?

56:32.020 --> 56:33.020
I blame myself.

56:33.020 --> 56:35.020
This is a boring turd laying inside.

56:35.020 --> 56:36.020
Was it boring?

56:36.020 --> 56:37.020
Yeah, I think so.

56:37.020 --> 56:38.020
You forgot a belt.

56:38.020 --> 56:39.020
Nope.

56:39.020 --> 56:40.020
It's because I forgot a belt.

56:40.020 --> 56:42.020
Or it's because the microphone didn't work

56:42.020 --> 56:43.020
when I stepped out.

56:43.020 --> 56:44.020
I don't know what it is.

56:44.020 --> 56:45.020
I listened to it when I edited it.

56:45.020 --> 56:48.020
Again, you're trying to find, like, a reason for something happening.

56:48.020 --> 56:50.020
You're trying to put structure on it.

56:50.020 --> 56:53.020
Anyway, but no, but what I'm saying is, no,

56:53.020 --> 56:55.020
I like what I like about Harmontown is that

56:55.020 --> 56:58.020
there's absolutely nothing about something horrible happening

56:58.020 --> 57:02.020
that precludes the possibility of people being smart and fun

57:02.020 --> 57:03.020
and...

57:03.020 --> 57:04.020
And playing D&D.

57:04.020 --> 57:05.020
...touching each other.

57:05.020 --> 57:06.020
That's awesome.

57:06.020 --> 57:08.020
No matter how bad things are,

57:08.020 --> 57:10.020
D&D will always happen on Harmontown.

57:10.020 --> 57:14.020
But yeah, something sticks in my head about what you were saying.

57:14.020 --> 57:15.020
That's a duet on the point.

57:15.020 --> 57:17.020
I think you put it succinctly.

57:17.020 --> 57:25.020
Creature born in 73 and being raised throughout the 80s.

57:25.020 --> 57:27.020
And we've entered this world now.

57:27.020 --> 57:28.020
It's a globalized world.

57:28.020 --> 57:34.020
And we're just so conditioned now.

57:34.020 --> 57:35.020
The news...

57:35.020 --> 57:37.020
Now we don't even watch the news.

57:37.020 --> 57:41.020
Now it's just we get all the information through this kind of trickle charge.

57:41.020 --> 57:45.020
But it's still a child of Tom Brokaw.

57:45.020 --> 57:47.020
It's a child of CNN.

57:47.020 --> 57:49.020
It's a child of all that old media.

57:49.020 --> 57:52.020
And it's kind of like, oh, did you hear the news today?

57:52.020 --> 58:00.020
The news in America, it's like this proudly isolationist kind of like heritage where we go.

58:00.020 --> 58:04.020
Somehow before you even got the information and parsed it,

58:04.020 --> 58:09.020
you're like, liberation fighters and bugle bugle bugle bugle.

58:09.020 --> 58:12.020
We don't know that they're human beings.

58:12.020 --> 58:14.020
We have no idea what the fuck is going on.

58:14.020 --> 58:15.020
Mordor, yeah.

58:15.020 --> 58:18.020
And the one thing that's never going to happen.

58:18.020 --> 58:21.020
I mean, maybe somewhere, but never on CNN and never on Fox News,

58:21.020 --> 58:24.020
never on the big news channels or outlets.

58:24.020 --> 58:27.020
No one's going to say, like, the president can't come on the air and go,

58:27.020 --> 58:29.020
hey, whoever did this, call me up.

58:29.020 --> 58:30.020
Let's talk about it.

58:30.020 --> 58:32.020
Let's find out why you did this.

58:32.020 --> 58:33.020
Let's address the situation.

58:33.020 --> 58:34.020
Let's be adults.

58:34.020 --> 58:35.020
Like, we don't want...

58:35.020 --> 58:36.020
No one can do that.

58:36.020 --> 58:40.020
We have to come down like a ton of like douchebag bricks on everything now.

58:40.020 --> 58:41.020
It has to be like, we're going to get them.

58:41.020 --> 58:42.020
Bring them to justice.

58:42.020 --> 58:44.020
Yeah, bring them to justice.

58:44.020 --> 58:45.020
I saw that a lot.

58:45.020 --> 58:47.020
Like, that is not a positive sentiment.

58:47.020 --> 58:48.020
No, no.

58:48.020 --> 58:50.020
It's just, it's hang them high with Clint Eastwood.

58:50.020 --> 58:54.020
And it's like, I know that people, like, when you're in pain,

58:54.020 --> 58:55.020
everybody wants shit to stop.

58:55.020 --> 58:58.020
But it's just like, when everything goes into, yeah,

58:58.020 --> 59:00.020
our little bubble got burst from them.

59:00.020 --> 59:01.020
And everything has to change.

59:01.020 --> 59:04.020
This giant shift has to happen where, like,

59:04.020 --> 59:07.020
the Constitution's going to go get sodomized in an alleyway and...

59:07.020 --> 59:08.020
And guess what?

59:08.020 --> 59:09.020
And guess what?

59:09.020 --> 59:11.020
As soon as that happens, no more bombs.

59:11.020 --> 59:12.020
Just fucking move.

59:12.020 --> 59:14.020
But I really, it is true.

59:14.020 --> 59:15.020
America isn't such a bubble.

59:15.020 --> 59:17.020
And it's a very unique situation.

59:17.020 --> 59:20.020
And these kinds of things, sort of like you said,

59:20.020 --> 59:21.020
put a little hole in the bubble.

59:21.020 --> 59:25.020
But, you know, try and remember this, but the bubble will be back.

59:25.020 --> 59:27.020
And next week, we won't give a shit about this.

59:27.020 --> 59:28.020
And we'll be back.

59:28.020 --> 59:29.020
Yeah, Robert Williams will be here.

59:29.020 --> 59:32.020
No one will give a fuck.

59:32.020 --> 59:33.020
Zartas?

59:33.020 --> 59:35.020
Glad you guys watched it.

59:35.020 --> 59:37.020
Well, let's get Spencer up, because he was there for you.

59:37.020 --> 59:38.020
Yeah, Spencer, come on up.

59:38.020 --> 59:39.020
Spencer, everybody.

59:39.020 --> 59:41.020
I think my...

59:41.020 --> 59:45.020
Oh, I see what this contraption is.

59:45.020 --> 59:47.020
It's my fault this thing...

59:47.020 --> 59:48.020
It's the worst.

59:48.020 --> 59:50.020
It's fiddling with this thing.

59:50.020 --> 59:55.020
Well, Camille was making points.

59:55.020 --> 59:58.020
Fiddling with the black iron staff.

59:58.020 --> 01:00:02.020
The entertainer twirls his expert fingers.

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:04.020
Spencer came out swinging.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:10.020
How many of you have now seen Zartas?

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.020
By applause.

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.020
Wow.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.020
A good number of people.

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:17.020
Now by Zarpause.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.020
The piece is evil.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.020
Yeah, the gun is good.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.020
The piece is evil.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.020
That movie's wild, man.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.020
I have to say, I've watched it.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:26.020
I think I've tried to watch that movie at least four times.

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.020
Last night, got through it.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.020
Didn't fall asleep.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.020
Made it through Zartas.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:35.020
Yeah, I mean, that movie starts strong and it trickles out.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.020
What's Zartas?

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.020
What is Zartas?

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.020
That's a very good question.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.020
We can start off by answering the simple question,

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.020
what is Zartas?

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:45.020
Well, there's a spoiler answer to that question.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:48.020
You can play it to me because I've never seen it.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.020
That doesn't matter.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.020
If you haven't seen it, watch it.

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.020
I mean, Zartas is an experience.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.020
If you have seen it, what do we have to talk about?

01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:01.020
It's like Vietnam.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.020
You're just like, yeah, I saw action.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.020
I was in the shit.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:13.020
Sean Connery, this is after he has been James Bond.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:19.020
And I guess he had a reputation for not saying no to a lot of stuff.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:23.020
But I think everyone thought Zartas was going to be the real deal.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.020
I think they thought it was going to be a goodie, right?

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:28.020
Yeah, there's no reason why.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:32.020
I find that to be a very compelling movie for the first 30 minutes.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:35.020
I'm very, very interested.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:40.020
There's a modern kind of cogent version of that movie

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.020
that I think is very important, truly,

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.020
because characters like Gilgamesh in ancient stories,

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:52.020
they're just mortals who proceed into the realm of immortality

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.020
with questions, with shit to conquer.

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.020
They go like, why is this thunder clapping?

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.020
Why did my friend die?

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.020
What's going on?

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:01.020
Why did a cheetah jump on my sister?

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.020
And they go to the ends of the earth.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.020
We're used to these stories where people climb beanstalks

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.020
and we shrug it off.

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:10.020
We don't look at that and go, a beanstalk?

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.020
That's stupid.

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:17.020
These characters, they would just walk to the edge of the earth,

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:20.020
which we thought existed, and then they would jump off it,

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.020
and then an eagle would pick them up, and then the eagle would go,

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.020
what are you doing?

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.020
And they're like, you heard me, motherfucker.

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.020
I want to talk to Apollo.

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.020
And they'd go, all right.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.020
I'm just following orders.

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:34.020
You'd have interactions with these confusing weird forces

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:37.020
at the time where characterizations of something

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.020
that people didn't understand.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.020
They didn't invent monotheism yet.

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.020
We still thought that everything unexplained

01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:44.020
had to have a different personality to it.

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.020
So it was amazing that we had these stories about it.

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:52.020
Sean Connery in this thing, he's this noble savage

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:55.020
that, he's not noble, what am I talking about?

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.020
He's a primitive savage who's,

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:01.020
the stone head comes down every day and goes like,

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.020
I'm sort of, here's your guns.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:06.020
And it pukes up all these guns to him and all his friends.

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:09.020
And he jumps in the mouth of the stone head,

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:11.020
and he just arrives with it.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.020
There are these brudels that live out like these people.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.020
This sounds like the greatest movie of all time.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:18.020
It's the greatest, it's the single greatest

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.020
beginning of a movie that's ever existed.

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.020
It starts off with a big head that looks like a big

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.020
gum drop, a stone gum drop,

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:27.020
and it's got a big kabuki face.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.020
And it comes out and goes, oh, it's all it does.

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:32.020
The gun is good, the penis is evil, and vomits guns.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.020
Wait, it says the penis is evil?

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:39.020
Yes, it says, the penis shoots seed, which creates life,

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:42.020
which horrifies the earth, the gun cleanses it of life.

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.020
The gun is good.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.020
The gun shoots death, yeah.

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.020
The penis shoots seed, the gun shoots death.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.020
It's basically, I mean, it's not a direct metaphor

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:54.020
for U.S. foreign policy, but it's like...

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:58.020
You know, Dan, this was written right after the

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.020
Gulf of Tonkin affair.

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:03.020
It's an exploration of any form of hegemony,

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.020
because what it turns out is that these rich people who live...

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.020
Wait, is this a spoiler now?

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:11.020
Sean Connery hitches a ride to this stone head,

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.020
and the first 10 minutes of this movie,

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:17.020
this head that pukes guns up to these poor people...

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.020
It says, the penis is evil.

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:21.020
It says, the penis is evil, go shoot all the people

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.020
that are reproducing it.

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.020
And it has glitter rhinestone eyes.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:28.020
Sean Connery shoots the camera, turns and shoots the camera,

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:30.020
representing his self-awareness.

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.020
And then he goes...

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:36.020
After the title sequence...

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.020
I think that's, fuck you, Roger Moore.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.020
After the title sequence, Sean Connery emerges from

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.020
a pile of grain inside the mouth of the stone head.

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.020
He has hitched a ride inside his own god.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:49.020
He shoots the guy who controls it.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:52.020
The head rides on autopilot back to the suburban

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.020
Silver Lake village where this guy lived.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.020
And in the first eight minutes of this movie,

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.020
you're watching Sean Connery with bandolier straps on

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:04.020
and a red one clock and a red ponytail,

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:07.020
walking around a two-bedroom apartment in Silver Lake,

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:12.020
looking through music boxes of a guy that created his world.

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:14.020
And going like, what the fuck?

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.020
And he doesn't know, his whole life has just been

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:19.020
raping and shooting, and he barely has language for it.

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:22.020
And he's looking at the apartment of this guy.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.020
It turns out all of life is just a fucking farce.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.020
But unlike Gilgamesh,

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:29.020
Sean Connery's only blunder is that he emerged

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:32.020
into a future realized in the early 70s of filmmaking.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:35.020
Where it turns into a really bad

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.020
community theater production of Pippin.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:41.020
And everybody is getting new, like doing little hand gestures.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.020
Well, everything eventually falls apart.

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.020
There's too much commentary on what was happening

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:48.020
at that point in the 70s.

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.020
There's too much like, well, yeah.

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.020
Well, boy, Pet Rocks today.

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.020
What's next?

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.020
Pet Boulders?

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.020
It's like, well, no one's going to care about Pet Rocks

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.020
in 2013 who were watching this.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:01.020
But yeah, like transcendental meditation.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.020
Obviously, it was a movie of its time.

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:07.020
But the thing that carries through, I think,

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:11.020
is a bunch of rich, privileged people

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:13.020
who have achieved immortality,

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.020
which is all our goal.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:18.020
And then these poor people are being created by them.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:20.020
One person's in charge of them,

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.020
like a commissioner or a mayor

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.020
is in charge of a basin of fucking poor people.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.020
Or a pop troller.

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:31.020
And one of them pops into the immortal world

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.020
and is walking around,

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.020
and he's like sort of part Frankenstein part.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.020
He's in the Matrix, too, doesn't he?

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:39.020
And there's a scene where he's at a party

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:41.020
and they're scanning his brain

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.020
and all his rapes and murders that he's committed

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:47.020
are on a screen behind him and all these fashionable people.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.020
But now our rapes, if it's a rape murder,

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.020
does that count as two?

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.020
Or is this not the important question here?

01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:56.020
And they're at an art gallery

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.020
and they're commenting on it and talking about it.

01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.020
And well, I think he's gauche.

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.020
Well, I think he's supposed gauche.

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:05.020
Then they try to get him...

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:10.020
This brutal savage

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:13.020
has a vestigial quality.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.020
His penis can achieve two mesons

01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:19.020
and become rigid in an erection.

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.020
Wait, so they don't get boners?

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.020
Yeah, they can't.

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.020
Because they're immortal.

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.020
They don't need to re-perhence them.

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.020
Why they can't die so they cannot get a heart attack?

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.020
They're actually immortal,

01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:29.020
not like poetically immortal.

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.020
But they punish you if you fuck up in a society

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.020
and you do anything bad.

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.020
They can punish you by aging you five years

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:35.020
and eventually you'll die.

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.020
No, eventually you will never die.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.020
Eventually you'll be senile.

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.020
You'll become senile forever.

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.020
You'll be an old person and then...

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.020
You'll become a renegade.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.020
Or a renegade.

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.020
Yeah, renegade are the crazy senile people.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.020
Or you can become an apathetic and be sexy but stupid.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.020
And they're in a permanent kind of New Year's Eve party

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:52.020
where they're wearing tuxes like,

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.020
Reed as the Oscars.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:57.020
They're all just like popping champagne

01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:00.020
and kind of stumbling around with their prosthetic makeup.

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:01.020
And they show...

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:02.020
It's pretty funny that they...

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:03.020
Because they have a little thing,

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.020
they have a ring where they can make a little computer

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:06.020
and it's a lot like Siri.

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:07.020
It's a lot like an iPhone.

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.020
But they're like, hey, what's this?

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:09.020
It's a flower. For what?

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.020
For decoration.

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.020
Oh, thank you, Siri.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.020
That's nice.

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:13.020
And you can put...

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:16.020
You can put a little screen up on the wall

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.020
like a projector.

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:18.020
It's pretty groovy.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.020
But then they're trying to prove

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.020
that they can get this guy hard.

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.020
So all these ladies are standing around

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.020
in their past-whole rows.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.020
Sean Connery.

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:26.020
Sean Connery standing in a red diaper?

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.020
Diaper.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.020
Short shorts.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.020
It's like American apparel, like ladies' short shorts.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.020
And he's got his balding man ponytail.

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:37.020
He's got a ponytail with a slight receding hairline,

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.020
a handlebar mustache,

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:43.020
and knee-high, like Captain Cook boots on.

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.020
How have I missed this movie?

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.020
I don't know.

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.020
It's a mistake.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.020
It's so good.

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.020
Yeah, it's nuts.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.020
But then they start showing them porn.

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.020
Like, watch this.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.020
I'm going to show you a man, get a boner.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.020
And all the ladies are standing around.

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.020
I've never seen that before.

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.020
And the first in this show is just a tits.

01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:59.020
Yeah, soapy titties.

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.020
The woman is like soap and upper titties.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.020
Like a big, like tight frame.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.020
It works as modern porn.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.020
Yeah, no.

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:07.020
It was hot.

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:12.020
Like the soapy titties was trans-like.

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.020
Because at first I wanted to mock it.

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.020
I was like soapy titties.

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.020
And then I was like, Jesus.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.020
I felt a little tangled.

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:22.020
I felt a little tangled.

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:28.020
I was assumed that a woman like soapy, like rubbing her boobs with soapy water was like,

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:32.020
that that was just like the same thing as a woman laying on the hood of a Ferrari.

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.020
It was just like a needless, like stylistic thing.

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.020
Oh, soapy is necessary and awesome.

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:39.020
At the end of the day, a naked lady is a naked lady.

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.020
Like kind of like who cares?

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.020
Like the idea that high heels or something.

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.020
Oh, the activity of that thing.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.020
Wow.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.020
Okay, soapy.

01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:47.020
Yeah, but he looks at that one and nothing happens.

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.020
And he kind of shakes it off.

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.020
Like Fernando Bellam's whaling.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.020
Like that pitch isn't good.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.020
And then they show another one of just two women in mud.

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.020
And that was notably less sexy.

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.020
Yeah, that one.

01:09:56.020 --> 01:10:02.020
And then you notice that Sean Conner is just staring at the woman who's kind of been the negative Nellie.

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.020
Like she hates him the most.

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:04.020
She's not in the mud pitch.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.020
No, she's putting on the presentation.

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.020
She's a curator.

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.020
And then everyone's eyes kind of cast down.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.020
And he's standing there completely stone faced just looking at the woman.

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.020
And clearly has got a boner.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.020
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:21.020
The boner computer guy, bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou.

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.020
How have I not seen this movie.

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.020
None of, none of your descriptions.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:27.020
And you've been describing it collectively for about 20 minutes,

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.020
maybe.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.020
Oh god I hope not.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:33.020
No single minute of that makes it sound like anything less than the best movie.

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.020
Well, Chris McKenna, one of Dan's writers in community,

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:39.020
and lovely fellow put disease in Zardas left.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:42.020
He was snoring all the way through.

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:46.940
It's like a fishing lure, like the head of it has its impact, and then it just tapers

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.860
off into this lullaby.

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:53.300
I can't believe there hasn't been a t-shirt with a stone-faced guy with glowing eyes that

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.900
says the penis is evil.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:55.900
I bet there is.

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.900
I'm certain there is.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:58.900
There's nothing.

01:10:58.900 --> 01:10:59.900
Yeah.

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.060
It's 106 minutes.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.060
It's definitely worth watching.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:08.620
Wait, so the rest of the movie is him in the immortal people world?

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.100
Most of it, yeah.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:15.300
The movie basically starts with him penetrating that veil, yeah.

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:20.620
As the movie continues, it reveals more truths than a Shyamalan in kind of a way that really

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:24.660
only served a disappoint, because actually the story I was invested in was a savage,

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:28.860
kind of naively bounding into this world and interacting with the immortals.

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:32.820
It turns out, oh, it's all a big thing.

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:37.180
It gets increasingly transcendental and increasingly 70s.

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:38.180
What's the big?

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.740
He can say spoiler alert and then tell me what the big, is that okay if we tell, it's

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:42.740
Zardaz.

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:43.740
You haven't seen it in 40 years.

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:44.740
No, I'm telling you.

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:47.500
It's too much a component of the enjoyment of the movie.

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:53.140
For people who haven't seen the movie, the spoiler, the big spoiler, which actually means

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:59.380
not, it's not important to the plot of the film, but it's such a delicious, ridiculous

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:00.380
spoiler.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:01.380
No, I'm not going to say it.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.900
Watch the fucking movie.

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.380
It's the one reward for watching that thing.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.900
All right, enough.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.100
Spencer, how you been, man?

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:14.380
Yeah, you know, Zardaz, I thought that whole reveal was kind of, you know, it was worth

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:19.980
it, but really, was I invested, I mean, there was the renegades and there was the apathetics,

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:23.860
but at the end of the day, I mean, it really peaked with the whole penis.

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.980
I didn't watch it.

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.980
You've never seen it.

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:28.980
Did that sound good?

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:29.980
You've never seen it?

01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:30.980
Yeah, no, not at all.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:31.980
You motherfucker.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:32.980
Yeah.

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:38.820
I was going to go, I got, yeah, I had a work meeting that night, I was going to go, you

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:39.820
know, head over.

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:43.580
You never have to have an excuse to have not watched Zardaz.

01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:48.180
I would have enjoyed seeing it.

01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:50.340
It slows all the way down now.

01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:55.020
It has that 70s patience, like Rollerball starts off like the best movie you've ever

01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:56.020
seen.

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:59.100
James Cohn's in a roller derby competition with a big metal ball and everyone has spikes

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.740
on and it's been her and like, what the fuck, this is the best, and then there's 45 minutes

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.060
of people at a cocktail party, but light a tree on fire.

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.060
Lighting up trees.

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.060
Yeah, it's so stupid.

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:09.060
Yeah.

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:10.060
Well, that's the 70s for you.

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:11.060
What?

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.900
It was like, on one hand, you did, it was like Harvintown.

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:18.820
You have no idea, you have no, no guarantees, like you don't, you don't know, like Robin

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:23.500
Williams shows up, I drop my pants, I confess to bisexuality or playing with matches.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.660
Who knows?

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.660
You might, you might.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.900
That's the same Zardaz guy.

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:33.380
Little Pyromaniac, look, the, the, on the other hand, it could just be a boring show.

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:39.060
That's just, everything, all the chairs are from Tyler, he's just, he's jamming on E-Nicotine

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.060
right now.

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:41.060
Yeah.

01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:42.060
He's been smoking those 18 milligram.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:45.060
Dude, I'm going to give you a throat hit in a second, man.

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:49.500
But if you read, if you read that, uh, Easy Riders Raging Bulls story, it's the story

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.620
of that, that, that Sin Escape changing.

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:56.180
But you were saying partly joking that, that as soon as they blew up the shark and Jaws,

01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:01.620
that as the point when movies became, I mean, we were all born into, certainly these people,

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:08.180
even me, were born into a world that had been pre-jossed, like, like we don't, we, movies

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.660
are part of our government.

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:14.060
It's the fifth estate, you know, it's, it's, it's, it is, it is our religion.

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:18.220
We go to these temples and we study these things and, and they are, there's a prerequisite

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.100
for these things, that they have to have a third act.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:25.420
Um, uh, the Death Star's got to blow up, the shark's got to blow up, the, the, the, the

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:28.620
people got to go home feeling like there's a purpose in their life.

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:33.380
Um, and, and the, but there was a point before that when, you know, it was like, hey, it's

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:36.340
just a movie, whatever, it's just another way to make money.

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:39.660
You could buy a Styx album or you might go to see this thing.

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.740
It's got Gene Hackman in it, he eats some chocolate, he jerks off in a cup and then

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:43.740
he shoots himself.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.740
That sounds like a third act.

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.740
The chocolate and the suicide?

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:52.740
That's, that's the French connection, right?

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.740
I'll recommend one.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.900
I'll recommend one movie from the seventies that's really, really awesome that a lot of

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:01.660
people haven't seen this movie called, uh, Abominable Dr. Fibes.

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.100
It's a, uh, Vincent Price movie.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.100
It's his best role.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:09.020
It's an amazing movie that you were, like you were saying, it's a product of its time,

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.020
definitely.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:11.020
Let's make that the assignment.

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:12.020
Let's watch.

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.020
I've never seen it.

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:14.020
Let's watch it.

01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:15.020
Abominable Dr. Fibes is fucking awesome.

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:16.020
It's one of my favorite movies.

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.820
Watch that for next week, Harmon, Harmonian.

01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:18.820
I'm sure Schrab has.

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.540
I think we'll watch it there and, you know, you probably fall asleep.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.820
It'd be harder to come by, probably not on iTunes.

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:30.420
Um, yeah, I don't know what it, all right, so, so does it miss, Kevin iTunes?

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.380
The Abominable Dr. Fibes.

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.380
Abominable.

01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.380
Watch the first one.

01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:37.060
Don't watch Dr. Fibes rises again.

01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:38.060
Watch the first one.

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.060
Is that a joke?

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.060
No.

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.060
Oh shit.

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.860
The real, I think it's great, but you got to start where it starts.

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.860
All right.

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:45.860
Okay.

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:46.860
Are there, are there, yeah.

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:50.300
Well, I want to, are there any, is there a woman in the audience who's had, who, who,

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.420
what woman thinks she's had the worst day?

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.420
I've had.

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.420
Tyler?

01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.580
We're not talking to you.

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:59.620
We heard about all your e-cigarettes, uh, there's a lady in front.

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.900
Is there, are there any, oh, are you raising your hand?

01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.780
Are you willing, are you willing to come up here?

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:04.780
Sure.

01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:06.780
Will you, will you play Aaron's part and Dungeons and Dragons?

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:07.780
Okay.

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:08.780
All right, what's your name?

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:09.780
Stephanie, everybody.

01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:10.780
Yes.

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:11.780
Mulray and Sedona.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.780
Tonight, the role of Mulray will be played by Stephanie.

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:16.980
Stephanie, what was so bad about your day?

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:19.180
Uh, I got yelled at by my boss.

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:22.180
Yeah, that's the worst thing that happened today.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:26.260
I'm sorry, I'm just goofing around.

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:27.260
I'm sorry.

01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:29.260
I just, obviously, subjective experiences.

01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:34.020
I know, but I, I felt that today, definitely, like, I called my mom to complain about my

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.860
boss yelling at me, and she, she said that to me, just like, really.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.700
But it doesn't mean your boss yelling at you wasn't shitty, you know?

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:40.700
It was still shitty.

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:41.700
What do you do for a living?

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.700
What's, what's the gig?

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.180
Uh, I work in an animal shelter.

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.180
Oh, Jesus.

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.180
Wow.

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:47.180
Well, is your boss is yelling at you?

01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:49.180
You're not killing enough kittens.

01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:50.180
Yeah, right.

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.180
I actually work at a no-kill shelter.

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.180
Oh.

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.180
What was she, what was your boss?

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:54.180
You killed too many kittens.

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.180
Read the sign, Stephanie.

01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:57.180
No.

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.180
You killed five.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.180
Sorry.

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:00.180
Oh.

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:03.180
What, what, what was her, uh, what was her beef with you today?

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:06.180
By the way, we're all assuming the boss is a she, is it?

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:07.180
No.

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.180
It is not.

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:10.180
I think that's very progressive of us.

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.180
I guess only women can say it.

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:13.180
I have a riddle for you.

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:15.180
Two kittens go into an animal shelter.

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.180
The doctor's a guy.

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:20.180
The doctor says, oh shit, okay.

01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.180
I cannot throw this kitten into a waste basket.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:24.180
It's my kitten.

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.180
The doctor's a doc.

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:29.180
The doctor's a doc.

01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.180
I've already heard it.

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.180
I've heard it.

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.180
What, what was her hang up with you today?

01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:35.180
What, what had she done wrong?

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.180
It's a long story.

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:42.180
Uh, basically, he, basically he accused me of trying to steal money from the company.

01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:43.180
Uh.

01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:45.180
Is there a lot of money to be made?

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:48.180
It's not exactly the boiler room with Vin Diesel.

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:49.180
No.

01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:53.180
Always be closing on the kitten adoptions.

01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:57.180
I think there's a character you work with who's always talking to the camera.

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.180
Let me explain how animal shelter works.

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.180
The kittens come in one door.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:03.180
People love them.

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.180
Then they adopt them.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:09.180
Everyone want, grandma goes home happy, but cha-ching.

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.180
Follow the money.

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:16.180
The coffee is for adopters.

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.180
It's okay.

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.180
We have a mentally unstable guy that makes our coffee, so it's fine.

01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:20.180
What was it?

01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:26.180
Is there, is there like a, is there like a till at the, at the animal shelter that came up short?

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:27.180
No.

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:29.180
Somebody's dividend in the animal shelter.

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.180
No kill animal shelter.

01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.180
We, we not killed six ferrets.

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:35.180
There's, there's 720 in this register.

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:40.180
Um, no, they were, they were accusing me more of stealing time money.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.180
They were saying that I worked more out.

01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.180
Oh.

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:46.180
I did that when I was a data entry clerk.

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:49.180
I was like, who knows if I'm entering data.

01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:51.180
But not killing animals.

01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.180
A higher stakes job to be.

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.180
Yeah.

01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.180
Cause all of a sudden there's just like, yeah.

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.180
If you don't show up to work on time, kittens die, right?

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:00.180
Absolutely.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.180
No, not really.

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:05.180
So your job is about getting animals rescued and stuff?

01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:06.180
Yeah.

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.180
Um, trying to get them adopted more or less.

01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:14.180
I work for specifically polls animals from LA shelters that are high kill.

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:17.180
So trying to make LA a no kill city.

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:18.180
That's the whole thing.

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:24.180
You go to other shelters and, and, and, and take like, like, like load up a truck and take

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.180
them to the no kill shelter.

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.180
Yep.

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.180
Yep.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.180
How does the money come to the no kill shelter?

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.180
How do you keep the lights on?

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:30.180
I have no idea.

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.180
I don't know.

01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:32.180
Well, where do you guys make money?

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.180
You must know where, where the money comes from.

01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:35.180
Something.

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.180
She only knows where it goes.

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.180
In her pocket.

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:40.180
More than should be.

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.180
Um, no, it's a huge, it's a huge organization.

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:49.180
It's, it's been around for like 40 years and they have lots of, lots and lots and lots

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.180
of donors.

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.180
So.

01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.180
Follow the money.

01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:53.180
I'm not.

01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:54.180
Take it easy, Tyler.

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.180
All right.

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.180
Let's play a bit of D&D.

01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:00.180
Stephanie, you're going to help us out and play Aaron's role of Mulray and Sedona tonight.

01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.180
Too much pressure.

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.180
No, no, no.

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.180
You'll be good.

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.180
You'll be good.

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.180
Yeah.

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.180
You'll be good.

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:10.180
Your, your job is much more pressure than.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:13.180
Also Aaron, Aaron told me in advance, I don't know if you heard last week's show.

01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:14.180
Were you here for last week's show?

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:15.180
No, I was not.

01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:16.180
Okay.

01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:20.180
Well, Aaron developed a new trick for fighting invisible enemies called the rope, rope.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.180
Rope packer.

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:22.180
Rope packer.

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:26.180
And she said that you're allowed to use it.

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:30.180
But Jeff's not allowed to fuck it.

01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.180
Those were her specific instructions.

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:32.180
We'll see.

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:36.180
I'm going to have benign violation of Coco tonight.

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:39.180
She's just going to take money from it.

01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.180
All right, Spencer.

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:41.180
What'd I do?

01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:43.180
Spencer, kick us off if you would please.

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.180
Okay.

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:51.180
Last time on Harmon Time, our heroes were on their way towards the thicket of ebb and

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:56.180
pillars, but soon they lost their bearings, assuming they had possessed them in the first

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.180
place.

01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:01.180
Bewildered and surrounded by pillars, Quark climbed the phallic columns and spied with

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:05.180
low light vision, a blob of color on the tip of a far off pillar.

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:09.180
About that time, strange squishing sounds began to surround the heroes.

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:13.180
With an air of urgency, the heroes headed towards the far off column.

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:17.180
As the heroes approached the sought after pillar, the squishing continued.

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.180
The colored shape called out.

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.180
It was a person.

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:24.180
Sharpie casting levitate began to approach the old man and Quark climbed up his pillar

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:27.180
to regard the white clothed old man.

01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:32.180
And Chris took some turns sending correspondence to the pillar dwelling Herman and Quark and

01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:34.180
Sharpie also had some words.

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:38.180
Before the whole ensemble moved back down to the ground level, the old man named Breffie,

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:42.180
as it happened, warned the heroes that they were under assault from a gaggle of deadly

01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:47.180
phantom funguses, which were funguses and definitely not fungi in this specific instance.

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:52.180
The gang slew the monsters with a far sword blast and a fireball spell, which quickly

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:53.180
ignited the ebb and pillars.

01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:58.180
Running quickly, they tore through the forest and came upon a web slung mass in the ebb and thicken.

01:21:58.180 --> 01:21:59.180
Woo!

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.180
Spencer!

01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:01.180
Spencer!

01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:06.180
I gotta say, man, you're in the zone tonight.

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:07.180
You came up in the zone?

01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:08.180
Yeah.

01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.180
I feel like you came loaded for bear.

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:15.180
Well, I feel like if you're like to do baseball or something, I only went at bat twice.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:19.180
So, you know, hitting two, two, you know, balls is easy.

01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:21.180
I guess this would be the third.

01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.180
Yeah.

01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:25.180
This one's more of a base hit.

01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:26.180
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:29.180
So, I mean, that's still, that's really good stats in baseball.

01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:33.180
You know, there's an alternate world where D&D is like the biggest sport and you're the

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:37.180
president of that world, because you're fucking amazing at it.

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:43.180
Wait, why is it two, I didn't get the, you know, why is it two times at bat?

01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.180
I don't understand.

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:49.180
Oh, because when I first came up, I had the comment about your, you know, I was narrating

01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:50.180
that, I think that went over well.

01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.180
He's two for two, he's saying.

01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:52.180
Yeah.

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:55.180
In baseball, if you hit three out of ten, you're in the Hall of Fame.

01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:56.180
Oh, I see.

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:01.180
But I mean, it's easier, it's easy to say I'm doing good if I said two things and both

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:02.180
of them went decently well.

01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:06.180
Speaking of doing good, I would like to share a triumph with my own.

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.180
You're doing great.

01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.180
Thank you.

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:13.180
I recently bought a new MacBook Pro and it's hardware is sophisticated enough to run a

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:17.180
Minecraft with all of the mods that I have had my eye on.

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:19.180
God, that's great news.

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:23.180
This is already the opposite of the Boston bomb story.

01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:28.180
Well, I didn't, you know, it was not my fault that that happened today.

01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:29.180
Sure.

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.180
We don't know that.

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:36.180
I, crazy white guy.

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:42.180
This is getting less benign and more deviant.

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:50.180
There's a lot of, it's called the tech world mod pack in Minecraft and it includes a lot

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:54.580
of generators and electronic things and Minecraft is a game of like mining things and you mine

01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:59.180
ore and then you smelt it into other things and you use those tools to mine ore ore.

01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:04.180
I, in tech world, I created an automatic miner.

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:11.180
So I, when I play Minecraft now, I just have a little box that plays Minecraft for me.

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:15.180
And it mines for me and it just like sucks up the ore and I just collect it.

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.180
So you're just crafting.

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:17.180
Yeah.

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:18.180
So it's just craft.

01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:20.180
The glee on your face is so awesome.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.180
Well, because I think that's so funny.

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:25.180
I saw a guy walking on the street today and he had a shirt that said, I love Minecraft

01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:28.180
and I wept openly.

01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:29.180
For humanity?

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.180
Yes.

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:33.180
That's a game I could never get into.

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:34.180
I've watched you play.

01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:36.180
It's fun to watch you play because it's fun watching.

01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:40.180
It's only, it's unlike any other thing because I mean, like you're talking about games like

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:44.180
Oblivion, the Elder Scrolls games, that we characterize those as like, oh shit, that's

01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:45.180
the hero in a video game.

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:48.180
So I played that for 100 hours, 200 hours, you know, whatever.

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:53.180
Like, I've been playing Minecraft for three, four years because they keep coming out with

01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:54.180
updates.

01:24:54.180 --> 01:25:01.180
It's beyond sandbox into just, it's a combination of knitting, smoking and jerking off.

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:04.180
Like it's just a thing you can do at an airport.

01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:07.180
You can do it while you're, you can't jerk off at an airport.

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.180
You can knit at an airport.

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:10.180
I'm just saying there's different tentacles.

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.180
You can jerk off at an airport.

01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:15.180
But you can't smoke.

01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.180
Spencer!

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:17.180
Yeah, oh yeah.

01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.180
You don't have to jerk off at an airport.

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.180
It's easier to jerk off than so.

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.180
You can do both.

01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:24.180
Not at the same time.

01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:25.180
That's absurd.

01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:29.180
They can tell you're jerking off and they can see your feet under the stall like shaking.

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:30.180
Like gyrating.

01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:32.180
You have to see them gyrating.

01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:35.180
They're going, who fucking, they're going to Hawaii or something.

01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:37.180
Who are they gonna tell?

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.180
I'm nervous that the tropical climate.

01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:41.180
They still don't want to see a guy jerking off on the way to the plane.

01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:45.180
That's the least of my worries while I'm jerking off in an airport.

01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:50.180
Weirdest thing I ever saw at LAX, I walked right where the baggage carousels are.

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.180
There's a bathroom right there.

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.180
I walked in the bathroom door.

01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:55.180
This was like 98.

01:25:55.180 --> 01:26:04.180
And there was a bathroom stall wide open and there was a guy facing away, bent over,

01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:12.180
pants around his ankles, ass cheeks like like like ass hole pointed at anyone that walked

01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:15.180
in the door, stalled her wide open.

01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:21.180
But with a little like toilet paper like in a little Halloween ghost shape, like like

01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:26.180
like kind of like dabbing at his asshole, like he was like wamping his ass but wanted

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.180
America to know.

01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:31.180
And you said to him, captain.

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:34.180
That's right.

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:37.180
I didn't say anything but I stared for a minute.

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.180
I was like what?

01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:41.180
I was like a deer in headlights.

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:44.180
And I'll never know what the guy, where's he from?

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.180
Where is that a thing?

01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:47.180
It was opposite.

01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:51.180
So he was wiping his ass at America.

01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.180
He was making a statement.

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:55.180
Maybe he was like this is what I do in Bangladesh.

01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:56.180
I don't know.

01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:59.180
Maybe it's like you know, did he have a brown ass?

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:01.180
No, I will tell you this.

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:03.180
Tell me this little.

01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:07.180
I really hope it's a crazy white guy.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.180
They can't all be crazy white guys.

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:15.180
And again, I'll tell you please for the second time tonight, respect my candor.

01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:19.180
Reward me for it because I could, I could pretend that this isn't in my head.

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:20.180
I got it.

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.180
I seem to recall that he was an olive skinned gentleman.

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:26.180
Hey, good job on that candor.

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:30.180
So you saw a brown butt wiping its ass at America.

01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:33.180
I, I, I, I, I saw an ass.

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.180
Maybe there was like a dry run of 9-11.

01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:37.180
I saw, I saw it.

01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:38.180
The stakes were much lower.

01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:39.180
I saw an asshole.

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:42.180
I saw the weirdest thing in the, in my life.

01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:44.180
But he was dabbing it delicately with a little, with a little peep.

01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:45.180
It was, it was, I wish I could.

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:49.180
Maybe he was doing the old like come here, come hit her like the dropped handkerchief bits.

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:50.180
You know, he was like.

01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.180
It was simultaneously.

01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:53.180
But I'll tell you what you're gonna get.

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:59.180
It was simultaneously the most private act, but performed so publicly.

01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:04.180
Like almost like you would think like, oh, he's, he wants me to see this.

01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:06.180
But he's not paying attention to me.

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.180
Stephanie, how you doing up there?

01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:08.180
You having fun?

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:09.180
Just great.

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.180
Yeah.

01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:12.180
There's a re, I think we can come up with a reason why he was doing that.

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:17.180
What if, if I'm there, and I'm using my phone and I'm on the toilet.

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:19.180
I was just trying to find out if Thunder was Zeus.

01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:20.180
It's a little bit.

01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:22.180
Your human desire to make sense of it.

01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:23.180
Exactly.

01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:24.180
We're finding Zeus here.

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.180
I'm texting.

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:28.180
As soon as I'm done, I drop my phone in the toilet.

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:31.180
And so I get up and I'm looking for in the toilet.

01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:34.180
And then I'm like, oh shit, my ass is still unwiped.

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.180
So I'm like, I'll do both.

01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:42.180
So I get toilet paper and I'm wiping my ass while I'm looking in the toilet bowl for the phone.

01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:43.180
That's definitely it.

01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.180
That's definitely it.

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:46.180
That's what Dr. Bangladesh was up to.

01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:48.180
The door open.

01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:51.180
The open door is another mystery.

01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:53.180
Why, there are four phones in 98.

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.180
It was pre-9-11.

01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:56.180
That's for sure.

01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:58.180
I don't know why that's significant.

01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:02.180
Oh dude, that's a total 9-10 story.

01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:08.180
This is like Mr. Show era.

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.180
Alright Spencer, what are we looking at?

01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:13.180
Before 9-11, I measured time of what season of Mr. Show was on.

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:16.180
There were only four years before 9-11.

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:20.180
Until HBO canceled existence.

01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:23.180
So Spencer, did we defeat the Funguses?

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:24.180
Yeah, you killed them.

01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:27.180
Yeah, I mean we could keep talking.

01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:31.180
If we keep going like 20 more minutes, I won't have to write anything next week.

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:36.180
No, we're about to go into a phase spider world.

01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:44.180
So you guys remember, you had sliced one in half and Sharpie had cast a fireball that blew up the other one

01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:48.180
and it lit the pillars on fire.

01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:50.180
Yeah, and then we ran into a phase spider thing.

01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:53.180
Spencer, I cast fireball on the spider area.

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:55.180
I'm fucking charging in.

01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:56.180
Do it.

01:29:56.180 --> 01:30:00.180
This national tragedy has filled me with like, fuck it, no regrets.

01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:03.180
We're still fighting phase spiders.

01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:04.180
Fireball!

01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:05.180
Well, you aren't fighting anything.

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.180
There's no fighting.

01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:07.180
No, I don't care.

01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:08.180
I'm fighting the unknown.

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:09.180
Yeah, I was talking to Jeff.

01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:10.180
I'm in a panic.

01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:11.180
Yeah, definitely.

01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:12.180
This is a pre-emptive strike.

01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:14.180
Casting fireball on a...

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:17.180
Crazy white guy!

01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:22.180
And the massive web of webs, the webby mass of webs, the webby mass of mass.

01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:24.180
Why is there a dollar?

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:28.180
The Federal Reserve needs to make hand crank radios.

01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:34.180
I feel like more than ever today we should try and reason with the spider rather than

01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:36.180
trying to just set a bomb.

01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.180
No, they teach at universities.

01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:39.180
Die!

01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:47.180
Okay, so, Sharpie casts fireball on what I'm assuming is like the center of like the

01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:49.180
webby mass or something, yeah?

01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.180
Yeah.

01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:51.180
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:55.180
So it hits, it strikes one of the nets, and immediately bursts into flames.

01:30:55.180 --> 01:31:00.180
Now, if you recall, fire is slightly less effective on the shadow plane.

01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:01.180
However...

01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:02.180
We don't remember being told.

01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:05.180
Yeah, no one remembers anything that happens.

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:09.180
But, uh, yeah.

01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:13.180
No, but, yeah, someone pulled out a torch and it didn't light very well.

01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:14.180
Right.

01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:16.180
It's like Langoliers.

01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.180
Sure.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.180
It's like Zardos.

01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:20.180
You didn't see Zardos.

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:21.180
I know.

01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:24.180
I didn't see Land-o-lakes either.

01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:26.180
Langoliers fucking rocks, dude.

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:28.180
Yeah, you should watch Langoliers, Spencer.

01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:29.180
Oh, watch all nine hours of it.

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:31.180
Valky from Perfect Strange is in it.

01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:34.180
I promise there's a payoff.

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:40.180
Spencer, is the webby mass being tied at any major points?

01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:42.180
Are there major points of tethering to the web?

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:45.180
Well, it's more being consumed by flames.

01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:46.180
Oh, it's right now.

01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.180
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:48.180
It's on fire right now.

01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:49.180
Yeah, and it's burning.

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:51.180
Okay, so that's probably good, right?

01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:52.180
Jar Jar, it's done.

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:53.180
To me!

01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:54.180
Wow!

01:31:54.180 --> 01:32:01.180
As the web starts to burn away, you can hear hisses deep within the webby mass.

01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:06.180
At the same time, you see Breffi kind of fall to his knees like he's been hurt or something.

01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.180
Uh-oh.

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:08.180
Breffi doesn't want it.

01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:10.180
What are you, like a spider baby?

01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:13.180
He's like, I'm Breffi!

01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:16.180
I'm Breffi!

01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:17.180
Breffi!

01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:18.180
Breffi!

01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:19.180
Breffi!

01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.180
Breffi!

01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:21.180
Breffi!

01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:22.180
Breffi!

01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:23.180
Breffi!

01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:24.180
Breffi!

01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:25.180
Breffi!

01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:26.180
Breffi!

01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:27.180
Breffi!

01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.180
Breffi!

01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:29.180
Breffi!

01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:31.180
I meant two episodes, Counting Treasure.

01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:33.180
I just wanted to move ahead.

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:35.180
Look what's happening to Breffi!

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:37.180
He was just a nice, whole wanderer.

01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:39.180
Listen to the last episode.

01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:41.180
He just, all he did was hang out.

01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:42.180
Oh my God!

01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:46.180
This is like you hurling fire, and then they have to go to the madrasas to fight us back.

01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:48.180
Go ahead.

01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:51.180
Too lofty.

01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:57.180
You see points raise up out of his shoulder blades as they elongate and stretch, and then

01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:01.180
pierce out of his back, forming spider-like legs.

01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:07.180
They elongate, and he grows and, you know, grows in size onto his newly formed legs,

01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:14.180
and is transformed into a hybrid humanoid spider form with clacking mandibles and sharp claws.

01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:16.180
And he's like, wait and go, butthead!

01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:21.180
Maybe it's not too late to make a friendship with the spider people.

01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:26.180
Hey, have you heard Lady in Red?

01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:28.180
Do you like that song?

01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:31.180
He makes some sort of utterance, but it's no longer English.

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:34.180
It's more of like a hissing, clacking sort of.

01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:37.180
If it's or do, I got a shot at it.

01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:41.180
Alright, I'm going to be the first to admit I made a mistake.

01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:42.180
No, you weren't first.

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:45.180
We said it before you said it.

01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:49.180
Yes, you're the first to agree.

01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:50.180
No, I said it.

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.180
You agree.

01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:52.180
Okay.

01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:57.180
How do you think you're third to this party?

01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:59.180
Maybe you'll still be friendly.

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:02.180
I'm going to assume that this brefi now means us some harm.

01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:06.180
I don't want to play the blame game.

01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:07.180
Because you'll lose.

01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:14.180
Yeah, you want to play the flame game.

01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:16.180
I try and reason with brefi.

01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:20.180
You have a minus six against righteous indignation right now.

01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:22.180
So what's your reason attempt?

01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:27.180
Hey, brefi, sorry.

01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:28.180
No, don't.

01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:32.180
I got one more attempt at it.

01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:39.180
Hey, brefi, our bad.

01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:42.180
Do you have diplomacy?

01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:44.180
Yeah, I got diplomacy.

01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:46.180
How many ranks do you have in diplomacy?

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.180
Eight, bro.

01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:49.180
Okay, eight ranks.

01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:54.180
He calms down a little slight bit.

01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:59.180
All right, Stephanie, guys, our bad worked.

01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.180
Stephanie, it's your turn.

01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:05.180
Can I put on my hat of disguise and be his mother?

01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:06.180
Whose mother?

01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:07.180
The spiders?

01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:08.180
Yeah.

01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:09.180
You don't know what she looks like.

01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:10.180
Would you like to approximate it?

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.180
Sure.

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:15.180
No, this sounds like a bad.

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.180
Yeah.

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.180
No, no.

01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:20.180
This is going to be worse than the fireball.

01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:27.180
You sort of look like the human form of brefi, but with long hair and womanly traits.

01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:32.180
Because the hat of disguise can't replicate monsters.

01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.180
It can only do humanoid shapes.

01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:39.180
This guy looks like somebody had a good relationship with his parents.

01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:41.180
You know, arachnids.

01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:44.180
The home is where the heart is.

01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:49.180
So Sharpie still has his mage armor spell active from the last session.

01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:52.180
You managed to shrug off his blow.

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:57.180
He rears back with one of his spindly spider-like legs and stabs you directly in the chest.

01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:03.180
However, the force armor guarding your body shrugs it off and it glances off your body.

01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:05.180
I go like this.

01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.180
I'm cocky about it.

01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:10.180
Do you brush it off your shoulders like Kobe did before his injury?

01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:13.180
I don't know what that means, but yes.

01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:17.180
I do what Kobe did.

01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:21.180
You rip your Achilles tendon, right?

01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:23.180
Is that what happened?

01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:28.180
And you cheat on your wife.

01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:33.180
Infidelity.

01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:34.180
It's a long fly.

01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:35.180
It's out of here.

01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:36.180
Spencer, another homework.

01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:40.180
Are you going to roll on the infidelity or?

01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:41.180
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:47.180
See if there's going to be charges.

01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:49.180
No, no.

01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:50.180
Go ahead.

01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:52.180
I think it's your turn.

01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:53.180
It's still your turn.

01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:56.180
You're now looking like a female-style brevi.

01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:58.180
Is he going to fall for it?

01:36:58.180 --> 01:36:59.180
I mean, no.

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.180
No.

01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:01.180
Yeah.

01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:02.180
Damn.

01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:03.180
All right.

01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:06.180
So we're trying to befriend him now, yes?

01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:08.180
We're going to try that.

01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:11.180
He has attacked.

01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:13.180
Throw an attack, Mulrainee.

01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:14.180
All right.

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:15.180
Fuck.

01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:25.180
I would like to shoot two arrows.

01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:30.180
No new taxes.

01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:31.180
Two arrows.

01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:33.180
I shoot two arrows.

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:38.180
It's a national.

01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:42.180
Remember for the next 25 minutes after she shoots two arrows, maybe back ribs are half

01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:43.180
off.

01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:47.180
It's a two arrow discount.

01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:49.180
Two arrows.

01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:54.180
One of the arrows strikes truants, hits him directly in the shoulder.

01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:56.180
The other flies astray.

01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:58.180
Did you say it strikes truant?

01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:59.180
Truant.

01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:00.180
True.

01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.180
Into his shoulder.

01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:04.180
Into the class.

01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:06.180
The arrow strikes truant.

01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:09.180
It goes to a fishing hole.

01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.180
Like Tom Sawyer, it blows up class.

01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:15.180
It avoids the constable.

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.180
All right.

01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:18.180
Befriend them.

01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:20.180
Oh, did I say how much damage that did?

01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.180
Four damage.

01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:22.180
Sorry, everybody.

01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:23.180
Not much.

01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:25.180
Spiders have lots of eyes, right?

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:27.180
Spiders, they got some eyes.

01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:31.180
The dazzling lights, would that be extra effective on their multiple eyes?

01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:32.180
The dazzling lights?

01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.180
Dancing lights.

01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:34.180
Dancing lights, no.

01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:36.180
Yeah, no, the dancing lights would not.

01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:39.180
Oh, dancing lights are just like kind of just for mood.

01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:42.180
It's like, if you want to fuck the spider.

01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:44.180
I haven't ruled it out.

01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:46.180
Yeah, it's like illusions.

01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:51.180
You know, it's like, you're like, oh, I want to make it look like a smiley face is illusion.

01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:52.180
I don't know.

01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:53.180
It's hard to explain.

01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:54.180
All right.

01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:57.180
I take some more reins.

01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:01.180
I'm going to do a combo move here with the rope tracker.

01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:04.180
I'm going to tie my far sword.

01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:06.180
Oh, no, I can't do that.

01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.180
Yeah, your far sword is a technique.

01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:08.180
Yeah, technique.

01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:10.180
You know, okay, forget the rope thing.

01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:14.180
I'm going to take my far sword and swipe it underneath it and try to chop off its legs.

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.180
Okay, so you can swipe at it.

01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.180
You don't have cleave.

01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:21.180
Yeah, you'll swipe at the legs, you know, the point being to try and like cripple them.

01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:23.180
Yeah, I want to immobilize this motherfucker.

01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:24.180
All right.

01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:27.180
In immobilizing strike.

01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:30.180
Oh, shit.

01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:31.180
That's a critical hit.

01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:33.180
Fuck yeah!

01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:35.180
Does that mean you rolled 20?

01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.180
Yeah, I rolled a 20.

01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:37.180
He rolled a 20.

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.180
Critical hit.

01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:40.180
Fucking chopped off all of his legs.

01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.180
No, no.

01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:42.180
Oh.

01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:44.180
Don't get ahead of yourself.

01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:46.180
You do chop off three of his legs.

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.180
Three of eight?

01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:51.180
Three of his legs are cleft straight off of his body and fall to the floor.

01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:55.180
No, if I attacked his head and I got a critical hit, would that have been it for this matter?

01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:59.180
No, I mean it still does the same amount of damage which is...

01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:01.180
It wouldn't have died.

01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:02.180
I'll catch you.

01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:04.180
About 7, 12, 24.

01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:05.180
So you did 24 damage.

01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.180
I'm with you.

01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:07.180
Okay, cool.

01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:08.180
Wow.

01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.180
So we got a hobbled spider.

01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.180
Oh yeah.

01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:13.180
I'm assuming as I aimed at one side that we chopped off like the left side.

01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:17.180
So let's just say you chopped off his left three legs.

01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:20.180
So now he can only walk in ever decreasing circles in one direction.

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:23.180
Or I mean you can hop around on like four feet or something.

01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:24.180
Okay.

01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:25.180
I don't know.

01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.180
Who knows, man?

01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:27.180
Spider physics?

01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:33.180
I would like to hear a list of monsters I could summon with summon monster three.

01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:34.180
Oh shit.

01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:36.180
Oh, darn it.

01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.180
They're all going to say squid.

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.180
They all want squid.

01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:42.180
Squids are so great to summon you guys.

01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:44.180
They just, they don't even drown it.

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:45.180
Is it Keith?

01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:46.180
Keith?

01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:47.180
Yeah, get a squid.

01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:49.180
A squid has, squids have multiple tentacles, man.

01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:53.180
There's a bit, like it was so big, we were in the confines of a ship.

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:55.180
Yeah, that actually made a lot of sense then.

01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:57.180
It was like summoning a rock, you know.

01:40:57.180 --> 01:40:58.180
It's telling some guys.

01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.180
What a whale.

01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:02.180
This is open melee, dude.

01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:04.180
Do what your heart says.

01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:05.180
I'm very interested.

01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:08.180
Last time he did that, he got us in deep shit.

01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:09.180
Yeah, that's right.

01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:11.180
Just don't, well, but now he started it.

01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:12.180
So whatever you gotta do.

01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:14.180
Yeah, dude, you know what?

01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:15.180
Redemption time.

01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:16.180
We are where we are.

01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.180
Redemption time, Sharpie.

01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:20.180
Thanks, guys.

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:25.180
Celestial Black Bear, Celestial Bison, Celestial Dire Badger, Celestial Hippogriff.

01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:26.180
Elemental Small Any.

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:28.180
So that's any type of elemental fire.

01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:29.180
Whatever, next.

01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:30.180
Okay.

01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:32.180
Fiendish Ape, Fiendish Dire Weasel.

01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:34.180
Fiendish Ape, Fiendish Ape.

01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:36.180
He's as tall as the sky.

01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.180
Fiendish Ape.

01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:40.180
Is that, is that the guy that chases you in Temple Run 2?

01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:41.180
Have you guys played Temple Run 2?

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:43.180
Let me, let me, let me just ask one thing though.

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:50.180
On the list of Summon Monster 3 Summonable Monsters, is there some kind of spider type

01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:51.180
monster?

01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:54.180
I just, just in case we get to see it.

01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.180
You know?

01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.180
Yeah.

01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:59.180
The tension is palpable.

01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:01.180
No, I'm not seeing it.

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:03.180
Fiendish Ape.

01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:05.180
Ape that shit, bro.

01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:07.180
Casting your arms in a magical manner.

01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:10.180
Oof, oof, ah, Agnamon.

01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:16.180
An ape, rather fiendish in appearance, leaps into being, and throws himself upon the,

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:18.180
the spider-like creature.

01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:20.180
Spider-um, terminate-um!

01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:21.180
Braffy.

01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:23.180
Uh, yeah.

01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:24.180
Okay.

01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.180
The, the, the, what's it called?

01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.180
The Fiendish Ape, right?

01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:28.180
Fiendish, yeah, that's what it's called.

01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:29.180
Fuck everything.

01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:35.180
The Fiendish Ape leaps upon the spider dude that I mentioned earlier, and begins immediately

01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:39.180
pummeling him with his fists, his big broad ape-like fists.

01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:40.180
Yeah.

01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:41.180
His sensual.

01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:45.180
Do you think there was a non-conflict resolution to this?

01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:46.180
Yeah.

01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:49.180
You fucked that when you threw a fireball at it.

01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:50.180
You guys want spoilers?

01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:51.180
No, no, no.

01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:52.180
Okay.

01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:55.180
Well, I mean, it will actually, it didn't, it's not going to come to fruition, like.

01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:57.180
Okay, tell us what could have happened.

01:42:57.180 --> 01:43:01.180
He's a spider dude, but if he didn't kill the spiders, he would have just been all like,

01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:03.180
I'm a spider dude, I'm going to help these dudes out.

01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:06.180
But he killed his spider, so it's like, fuck you!

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:08.180
So it's completely Sharpie's fault.

01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:09.180
Yeah, definitely.

01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:11.180
Dude, he told you.

01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:15.180
Or, no, I mean, I mean, he might have jumped on you guys anyway as an amateur.

01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.180
Yeah.

01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:18.180
What do you, you're not hearing the same things he's saying.

01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:20.180
I saved the world.

01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:22.180
Dealing six damage.

01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:24.180
Six damage, bro.

01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:26.180
Six world-saving damage.

01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:27.180
I support you, sure.

01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:29.180
Okay, is it, is it my turn now?

01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:30.180
Yeah.

01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:35.180
Uh, misreading the situation, I still try and reason with it.

01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:39.180
Listen, a lot of mistakes were made today.

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:41.180
Dude, I'm on your side.

01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:45.180
Do you have, do you have, uh, Intimidate or just Diplomacy?

01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:46.180
I realize-

01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:49.180
Dude, do you have total denial?

01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:51.180
Uh, it's not under-

01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:53.180
Do you have psychosis?

01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:54.180
What level of psychosis do you have?

01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:55.180
Is that under peace?

01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:57.180
No, then I don't have it.

01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:58.180
It would be under-

01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:01.180
Um, all right, listen, I know we chopped off three of your legs and then

01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:04.180
sent a fiendish ape to punch you in the face.

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:08.180
We've met almost none of it.

01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:12.180
Hey, are we cool?

01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:13.180
It's like-

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:15.180
Are we cool?

01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:16.180
Brefi, right?

01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:17.180
Am I saying that right?

01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:21.180
Your words seem to have, have a swaying effect on him.

01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:24.180
He looks down at the ground and at all of his bleeding stumps

01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:26.180
and realizes he can't win this combat.

01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:27.180
Oh!

01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:31.180
All right, well then I, I weirdly, I take my cloak

01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:33.180
and I try and bandage one of his legs.

01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:36.180
But you guys might have healing potions if you're down to heal him.

01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:39.180
I, I healed the spider.

01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:41.180
Is that a good idea or a bad idea?

01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:43.180
Do you have healing potions?

01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:46.180
Hey, can I borrow some healing potions?

01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:50.180
I've got one left and I just, I just chopped three of his legs up.

01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:51.180
We gotta use it.

01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:52.180
Listen, I know this is a weird idea.

01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:54.180
He's kind of successfully good-copping them, though.

01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:55.180
This might work.

01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:56.180
Okay, all right, okay.

01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:59.180
All right, uh, Christopher, I, I, uh-

01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:01.180
I just, you know what I do, I don't try and bandage it,

01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:05.180
but I, like, try and engage it while, uh, Malred's gonna attack it, okay?

01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:07.180
So I'm gonna be like, so, like, what?

01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:09.180
Like, your deal, like-

01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:14.180
My whole last three generations were just wiped out.

01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:19.180
All right, um, I don't think I have any legs to stand on, so...

01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:21.180
But I did a sh- sh- sh- sh-

01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:22.180
No, I was not-

01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:23.180
Look at that!

01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:24.180
Damn it!

01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:25.180
I was not trying to-

01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:27.180
Too soon!

01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.180
Too soon!

01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:31.180
Oh, God, a bad choice of words!

01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:32.180
I just, uh...

01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:34.180
I wish it was a crazy white guy instead.

01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:36.180
No.

01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:40.180
All right, I step back and, uh...

01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:41.180
Malred?

01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:43.180
Wait, so wait, did you use my healing potion or not?

01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:44.180
I didn't hear it being used.

01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:45.180
No, no, no.

01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:46.180
No, I gave it back and I said,

01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:48.180
We gotta kill this guy!

01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:51.180
Hey, we're on your side, bro.

01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:54.180
I go up to one of his spider legs and I go,

01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:59.180
Oh, no, I don't have anything, but I just wanted to know that-

01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:00.180
You're taunting him.

01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:02.180
Well, uh, I'm not taunting him.

01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:03.180
No, he's trying to-

01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:04.180
I give him some skittles.

01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:05.180
Kill him lowly!

01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:07.180
A lot of times, like, like, like, like,

01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:09.180
like, shock is what'll kill you.

01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:10.180
If people think that it's no big-

01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:13.180
I say, you know, I had a spider brother,

01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:17.180
this same thing happened to him, and he's fine.

01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:19.180
The same thing that happened to him is that you killed

01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:22.180
three generations of his babies.

01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:24.180
Obviously, some mistakes have been made.

01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:28.180
I pull Mulraine aside, knowing it's her turn next,

01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:30.180
and I go, look, I'm a barbarian.

01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:31.180
Let's kill this piece of shit.

01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:32.180
Fuck yeah.

01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:33.180
Yeah.

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:35.180
You're a lie false flat, Sharpie.

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:36.180
Wait, I don't like you, no, never mind.

01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.180
You don't like me?

01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:38.180
No, but I do like you.

01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:39.180
Yeah, we like you.

01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:40.180
Sorry, I was kidding.

01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:41.180
You're a lie false flat.

01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:42.180
It doesn't work.

01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:43.180
Well, Mulraine-

01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:44.180
He's not buying it.

01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:45.180
Well, I feel bad.

01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:48.180
I feel, I mean, I, look, Mulraine,

01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:50.180
do you have anything that can-

01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:51.180
What is-

01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.180
We got him on the ropes, I mean.

01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.180
Maybe he could-

01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:56.180
I have sleep arrows.

01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:58.180
Can at least knock him out.

01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:03.180
It's like in, you know, what was it, thin red line.

01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.180
You know, just give him a lot of sleep arrows

01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:07.180
and like a little drift off.

01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:10.180
I don't know how to kill animals.

01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:11.180
Can we have a little power on,

01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:13.180
decide exactly what we want out of this?

01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:15.180
Oh yeah, she's from a no kill shelter.

01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:18.180
She's the wrong person, dude.

01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:21.180
Why don't you just steal some money from the spider?

01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:23.180
What if I could?

01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:25.180
And then we'll be okay.

01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:26.180
Alright, let's just kill him.

01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:28.180
What are, what are, what are merciful arrows?

01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:30.180
Merciful arrows deal extra damage,

01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:33.180
but they only deal non-lethal damage.

01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.180
So you can, if you're trying to knock people out,

01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:39.180
you can stab them full of merciful arrows, no problem.

01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:40.180
But yeah, they won't die.

01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:41.180
I have a bedroll.

01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:44.180
I'd like to wrap it around the spider's head.

01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:46.180
What?

01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:47.180
Yeah.

01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:48.180
Just drape it over.

01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:50.180
That's a successful throwback.

01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:53.180
That's like a critical hit on throwback.

01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:54.180
Okay.

01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:57.180
And they go shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.180
I start singing to it.

01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:00.180
To lull it to sleep.

01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:01.180
What do you sing?

01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:03.180
Yeah, you know what I sing.

01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:05.180
I'd like to hear it.

01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:09.180
Hit it more right.

01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:12.180
Alright, I would like to shoot

01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:15.180
one sleep arrow.

01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:16.180
Alright.

01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:19.180
Loosing a sleep arrow from your bow.

01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:21.180
You strike him directly in the face.

01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:24.180
Lady and Red!

01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:27.180
He loses consciousness to the dulcet tones

01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:30.180
of Christopher's sweet, sweet voice.

01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:32.180
I put a giant glass over it

01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:38.180
and then slide a huge 60-foot piece of cardboard

01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:40.180
under the glass.

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.180
I would almost never suggest this,

01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:43.180
but I suggest quark.

01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:45.180
If you want to fuck something,

01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:47.180
now's the time to do it.

01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:49.180
You want a story for your friends.

01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:50.180
Okay.

01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:52.180
Under one condition.

01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:54.180
Somebody takes a photo of it.

01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:56.180
I lift up the glass

01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:58.180
and I get inside the glass

01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:02.180
with the sleeping mutilated spider.

01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:05.180
What's the D&D equivalent of a photo?

01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:10.180
As a...

01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:13.180
You can make an illusion about it.

01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:15.180
Let's all just stand and watch

01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.180
and really let it sink in.

01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:19.180
It's really absurd.

01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:22.180
I go over to the glass

01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:24.180
and I lift it up.

01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:25.180
There's no glass.

01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:27.180
I don't have a giant glass.

01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:32.180
I panted my butt like you did it.

01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:35.180
I'm putting the glass back down.

01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:38.180
This is a misuse of my song.

01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:40.180
This is not what I meant.

01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:44.180
I can't hear you because I'm in the imaginary glass right now.

01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:46.180
I go up to the spider

01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:49.180
and I slowly pull the bedroll back off its head.

01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:50.180
And I say...

01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:51.180
I cover Coco's eyes.

01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:53.180
I cover Coco's eyes.

01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:56.180
And I just start fucking that spider.

01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:58.180
But as I'm fucking him,

01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:00.180
I'm giving him posts of subconscious suggestions

01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:02.180
of the look.

01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:05.180
We're going to let you live.

01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:07.180
And when you're awake,

01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:09.180
we're going to heal you.

01:50:09.180 --> 01:50:12.180
And if you want to come with us, you can.

01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:16.180
But I'm going to fuck you every night.

01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:19.180
And then I take out my giant sword

01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:22.180
and I drive it straight to the back of the spider's neck.

01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:24.180
Wait, what?

01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:28.180
You're just a scumbag.

01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:31.180
Shut up, you guys. This guy tried to kill us all.

01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.180
You're a fucking scumbag.

01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:34.180
You're a scumbag.

01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:36.180
But you just told him...

01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:38.180
I was this intricate deal there.

01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:41.180
We're going to let you live, but then we're going to listen to you.

01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:44.180
I'm making fun of all of you guys.

01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:46.180
You just wanted to fuck something as it died.

01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:48.180
Taking out my sword.

01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:50.180
You wanted to go from living for dead

01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:53.180
and living to dead with you inside them.

01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:55.180
That's what you wanted.

01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:57.180
I'm not denying that.

01:50:57.180 --> 01:50:59.180
The penis is evil.

01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:01.180
But the sword is good.

01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:03.180
Hoisting my sword.

01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:05.180
Out of its sheath,

01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:07.180
I drive it straight down,

01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:09.180
like Matador-style,

01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:11.180
to the back of the spider's head,

01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:13.180
with a sickening fluff.

01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:15.180
It pierces his head easily.

01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:17.180
Brains ooze out.

01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:18.180
You did tonight.

01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:21.180
I call out father!

01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:24.180
As I assume, a little bit of spider blood splashes my face.

01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:27.180
They catch me weirdly masturbating on my own.

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:29.180
So is the spider dead?

01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:30.180
Yeah.

01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:32.180
You put your sword through his head.

01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:33.180
You know what?

01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:35.180
And you'll pee this through its blood.

01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:36.180
That's our time.

01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:38.180
But thank you for coming to Harmontown tonight.

01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:40.180
We did it!

01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:42.180
Thank you, Stephanie.

01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:43.180
Thank you.

01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:46.180
Stephanie is Mulray and Sedana.

01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:48.180
Thank you again, of course.

01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:49.180
Spencer Crane.

01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:51.180
Thank you, Tyler, and the e-cigarette.

01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:52.180
Thank you, Bill.

01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:54.180
Violation Theory.

01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:56.180
One more time for Kameo Manziani,

01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:57.180
as always.

01:51:57.180 --> 01:51:59.180
Thank you, Kameo.

01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:02.180
Get well, Erin McGathy, wherever you are.

01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:04.180
I've been Jeff Davis again,

01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:05.180
as your com totaler.

01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:07.180
One more time for Dan Harmon,

01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:08.180
the mayor of Harmontown.

01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:10.180
Good night.

01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:12.180
And drive safe.

01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:13.180
God bless you.

01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:14.180
We love you.

01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:15.180
Nessie.

01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:16.180
Nessie, you're in the show.

01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:19.180
You just kill a spider and you fucking play Zalion.

01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:21.180
Yeah, how did we not just land up on that now?

01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:22.180
Fuck a spider.

01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:23.180
Fuck a spider.

01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:25.180
Kill it and play some E.L.O.

01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:27.180
I'm gonna just get out of here.

01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:52.180
I'm gonna just get out of here.
