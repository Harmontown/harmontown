{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:26.160\nHello everybody, welcome to Harmontown!\n\n00:26.160 --> 00:30.380\nAs always, every Monday night here at Meltdown, the Nerdmelt Theatre in Hollywood, California,\n\n00:30.380 --> 00:34.600\nHarmontown, it's once again in session to solve all the world's crises.\n\n00:34.600 --> 00:40.500\nOnce you welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmonn!\n\n00:40.500 --> 00:47.820\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n\n00:47.820 --> 00:49.420\nyeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...\n\n00:49.420 --> 00:50.420\nUhh, yeah.\n\n00:50.420 --> 00:51.720\nWe got lots to talk about.\n\n00:51.720 --> 00:52.720\nUhh...\n\n00:52.720 --> 00:54.020\nLet's get right to it then.\n\n00:54.020 --> 00:55.020\nYeah.\n\n00:55.020 --> 01:00.020\nI want to talk about the obvious thing later because it's a weird area.\n\n01:00.020 --> 01:05.020\nI want to talk about it with friends because I was sealed off today, completely sealed off.\n\n01:05.020 --> 01:10.020\nI was writing for Rick and Morty from bed at a deadline and I'm doing my pass on a script\n\n01:10.020 --> 01:14.020\nso I was completely turned my phone off, didn't have the internet and it was kind of like,\n\n01:14.020 --> 01:20.020\nand then Aaron called me from out in the world and told me about what happened in Boston today\n\n01:20.020 --> 01:25.020\nwhich by the time you're hearing this as a recording, we'll have all these facts but it just happened today\n\n01:25.020 --> 01:31.020\nand so what I want to talk about is actually just the craziness about it.\n\n01:31.020 --> 01:35.020\nIt's not like we're going to score noble points by not talking about it\n\n01:35.020 --> 01:39.020\nnor are we going to score any other kind of point by talking about it.\n\n01:39.020 --> 01:44.020\nIt's endlessly fascinating of course and we should capitalize on it\n\n01:44.020 --> 01:48.020\nbut because it would be weird to talk about that first\n\n01:48.020 --> 01:52.020\nand then talk about Aaron's leg.\n\n01:52.020 --> 01:57.020\nI just like the brave new world we live in where you can come out and the audience shows up in Hollywood, California\n\n01:57.020 --> 02:03.020\nand a guy comes out with a red solo cup in his hand and just reading off his phone for the first two minutes of the show.\n\n02:03.020 --> 02:04.020\nI love it.\n\n02:04.020 --> 02:07.020\nI was just holding it up. I'm not reading anything off of it.\n\n02:07.020 --> 02:11.020\nThis is what my phone says. This is my Evernote app.\n\n02:11.020 --> 02:18.020\nIt says Aaron's leg, wedding cake, Minecraft, Alex Space Jam, and Zardaz. That's what it says.\n\n02:18.020 --> 02:20.020\nThat sounds like a full lineup.\n\n02:20.020 --> 02:24.020\nI get nervous so I stare at things. I'll put this away.\n\n02:24.020 --> 02:27.020\nAaron's not here tonight because she cut her leg.\n\n02:27.020 --> 02:32.020\nIs she a cutter?\n\n02:32.020 --> 02:34.020\nAnswer the question.\n\n02:34.020 --> 02:45.020\nI have these very low, low, thigh-high, tetanus-riddled, sharp, rusty, pirate yard lamps.\n\n02:45.020 --> 02:54.020\nAs you walk up the stairs to Danadoo and it was a long time coming.\n\n02:54.020 --> 03:02.020\nSomeone finally, while walking down them, I believe she was cutting a wide berth for her.\n\n03:02.020 --> 03:06.020\nShe was disembarking for one of Dustin's dates.\n\n03:06.020 --> 03:11.020\nFor those of you who listen to This Feels Terrible, her podcast, she had just finished recording like a date preamble.\n\n03:11.020 --> 03:17.020\nThey're doing this bachelor kind of thing where Dustin's going on dates with women that are throwing themselves at Dustin.\n\n03:17.020 --> 03:19.020\nIt's a horrible affair.\n\n03:19.020 --> 03:24.020\nThese lovely young ladies are coming over to my house where Farrell Audio is recording its podcast.\n\n03:24.020 --> 03:25.020\nSounds horrible.\n\n03:25.020 --> 03:28.020\nGetting interviewed with Dustin and whatnot and then they leave for these dates.\n\n03:28.020 --> 03:33.020\nLeaving this date for this date, Aaron escorting them out.\n\n03:33.020 --> 03:41.020\nI think to be polite, finally walked close enough to one of these horrible, jagged, toothy cartilage.\n\n03:41.020 --> 03:45.020\nI think they're made out of shark cartilage, these yard lights that I have.\n\n03:45.020 --> 03:50.020\nThey're green and yellow and they're supposed to be just black probably.\n\n03:50.020 --> 03:57.020\nBut I think they were made in the 1900s and just covered in tetanus.\n\n03:57.020 --> 04:02.020\nAnd honed to her razor's edge right along the path just coated.\n\n04:02.020 --> 04:05.020\nIt's titanium laminated in tetanus.\n\n04:05.020 --> 04:08.020\nSo she scraped her thigh on it.\n\n04:08.020 --> 04:14.020\nShe's got this cut on her leg about the length of, let's say, I don't know what I'm holding up here.\n\n04:14.020 --> 04:15.020\nA cigarette.\n\n04:15.020 --> 04:18.020\nBut the length of my penis looks like three inches.\n\n04:18.020 --> 04:21.020\nYour penis is shaped and colored exactly like a cigarette if I'm not mistaken.\n\n04:21.020 --> 04:22.020\nYes.\n\n04:22.020 --> 04:23.020\nAn E-cigarette.\n\n04:23.020 --> 04:28.020\nIt has harmless water vapor in it.\n\n04:28.020 --> 04:30.020\nBut you can get it in any flavor.\n\n04:30.020 --> 04:32.020\nCocoa pebbles.\n\n04:32.020 --> 04:34.020\nWhy is this guy raising his E-cigarette?\n\n04:34.020 --> 04:35.020\nOh, you're holding up your E-cigarette.\n\n04:35.020 --> 04:36.020\nAre you a vapor?\n\n04:36.020 --> 04:37.020\nAre you vaping?\n\n04:37.020 --> 04:38.020\nYeah.\n\n04:38.020 --> 04:40.020\nDo you vape indoors?\n\n04:40.020 --> 04:41.020\nYeah, at work.\n\n04:41.020 --> 04:42.020\nI don't give a shit.\n\n04:42.020 --> 04:43.020\nAre you a former smoker?\n\n04:43.020 --> 04:44.020\nYes.\n\n04:44.020 --> 04:46.020\nOkay, so, hey, come up here.\n\n04:46.020 --> 04:47.020\nWhat's your name?\n\n04:47.020 --> 04:48.020\nI'm sorry, if you want to come up here.\n\n04:48.020 --> 04:49.020\nI learned my...\n\n04:49.020 --> 04:53.020\nOkay, yeah, because if you start crying or freaking out, I don't want to...\n\n04:53.020 --> 04:54.020\nHey, why did you come up here?\n\n04:54.020 --> 04:55.020\nYou told me to.\n\n04:55.020 --> 04:56.020\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n04:56.020 --> 04:57.020\nYou told me to come up here, dude.\n\n04:57.020 --> 04:58.020\nI was drinking.\n\n04:58.020 --> 04:59.020\nWhat's your name?\n\n04:59.020 --> 05:00.020\nTyler.\n\n05:00.020 --> 05:01.020\nTyler, everybody.\n\n05:01.020 --> 05:02.020\nWelcome, Tyler.\n\n05:02.020 --> 05:03.020\nHere we go.\n\n05:03.020 --> 05:04.020\nOkay.\n\n05:04.020 --> 05:06.020\nAll right, an unexpected segment about E-cigarettes.\n\n05:06.020 --> 05:07.020\nIt's fun.\n\n05:07.020 --> 05:13.020\nThen we'll talk about the worst terrorist attack in our country since 9-11.\n\n05:13.020 --> 05:15.020\nBut first, E-cigarettes.\n\n05:15.020 --> 05:17.020\nFat or fashion?\n\n05:17.020 --> 05:18.020\nI don't know.\n\n05:18.020 --> 05:20.020\nOkay, so there's water...\n\n05:20.020 --> 05:21.020\nThere's water vapor.\n\n05:21.020 --> 05:22.020\nYeah, water vapor.\n\n05:22.020 --> 05:24.020\nWell, water vapor is the only emission.\n\n05:24.020 --> 05:28.020\nIt starts off with the chemical that is food coloring, which is...\n\n05:28.020 --> 05:29.020\nWe're not going to get into it.\n\n05:29.020 --> 05:30.020\nPurple or glycerin.\n\n05:30.020 --> 05:31.020\nOkay.\n\n05:31.020 --> 05:33.020\nFlavor, and then however much nicotine you want.\n\n05:33.020 --> 05:34.020\nRight.\n\n05:34.020 --> 05:37.020\nSo I know people who smoke E-cigarettes at work.\n\n05:37.020 --> 05:38.020\nThey're into it.\n\n05:38.020 --> 05:39.020\nThey're not into it.\n\n05:39.020 --> 05:43.020\nI know someone who doesn't smoke at all and kind of got into it just because everyone else\n\n05:43.020 --> 05:44.020\nat work was doing it.\n\n05:44.020 --> 05:45.020\nWell, this is a new thing.\n\n05:45.020 --> 05:46.020\nIt's a new thing.\n\n05:46.020 --> 05:48.020\nI'm going to bed next to my girlfriend today.\n\n05:48.020 --> 05:50.020\nShe comes back from getting her antibiotics.\n\n05:50.020 --> 05:51.020\nShe's holding a bag.\n\n05:51.020 --> 05:52.020\nShe goes, I got it.\n\n05:52.020 --> 05:54.020\nI know I keep going off on our diet.\n\n05:54.020 --> 05:57.020\nIt's because I come for it and all this stuff.\n\n05:57.020 --> 05:58.020\nShe does this big monologue.\n\n05:58.020 --> 06:00.020\nAnd I'm like, what is it going to happen?\n\n06:00.020 --> 06:03.020\nThere's this thing that ends with couples therapy.\n\n06:03.020 --> 06:06.020\nIt's my fault that we always eat mac and cheese.\n\n06:06.020 --> 06:08.020\nShe pulls out E-cigarettes.\n\n06:08.020 --> 06:09.020\nJust today.\n\n06:09.020 --> 06:10.020\nThis is why I brought you up here.\n\n06:10.020 --> 06:12.020\nFor the both of you, like, his and hers E-cigarettes?\n\n06:12.020 --> 06:13.020\nNo, no.\n\n06:13.020 --> 06:15.020\nI can't touch them for religious reasons.\n\n06:15.020 --> 06:16.020\nI'll explain later.\n\n06:16.020 --> 06:18.020\nI believe it.\n\n06:18.020 --> 06:24.020\nBut I want to know about this because she got zero nicotine E-cigarettes.\n\n06:24.020 --> 06:25.020\nYeah.\n\n06:25.020 --> 06:28.020\nI mean, I guess you get kind of the experience from it.\n\n06:28.020 --> 06:29.020\nYou breathe in.\n\n06:29.020 --> 06:30.020\nYou're like, oh, something's going in.\n\n06:30.020 --> 06:31.020\nYou breathe out.\n\n06:31.020 --> 06:33.020\nIt has what they call a throat hit.\n\n06:33.020 --> 06:34.020\nIt has a throat hit.\n\n06:34.020 --> 06:36.020\nThat's the worst name, though.\n\n06:36.020 --> 06:37.020\nThroat hit.\n\n06:37.020 --> 06:39.020\nLike, oh, man, I got this 36 milligram.\n\n06:39.020 --> 06:41.020\nIt's got the best throat hit.\n\n06:41.020 --> 06:46.020\nAnd guys in their basements modding power drill batteries into E-cig things.\n\n06:46.020 --> 06:47.020\nYeah, no.\n\n06:47.020 --> 06:48.020\nWhat they're modifying.\n\n06:48.020 --> 06:49.020\nThere's something.\n\n06:49.020 --> 06:54.020\nIt looks like they're holding an electric screwdriver in their hands.\n\n06:54.020 --> 06:56.020\nTo get more nicotine?\n\n06:56.020 --> 06:57.020\nYeah.\n\n06:57.020 --> 07:00.020\nSo the battery causes the coil to heat faster so they get this.\n\n07:00.020 --> 07:01.020\nYeah, no.\n\n07:01.020 --> 07:03.020\nThey're like, I totally hacked my E-cigarettes.\n\n07:03.020 --> 07:04.020\nExactly.\n\n07:04.020 --> 07:05.020\nNo.\n\n07:05.020 --> 07:06.020\nI put tobacco in it.\n\n07:06.020 --> 07:07.020\nExactly that.\n\n07:07.020 --> 07:09.020\nI jail broke that motherfucker in there.\n\n07:09.020 --> 07:11.020\nBasically.\n\n07:11.020 --> 07:17.020\nI drove by a gas station and it said electronic cigarettes.\n\n07:17.020 --> 07:22.020\nThat sounds like a joke from a sketch group that was shitty 20 years ago.\n\n07:22.020 --> 07:29.020\nOr a horrible 1994 direct-to-video movie set in the future with a lot of kickboxing in it.\n\n07:29.020 --> 07:31.020\nA throat hit is a critical punch, sure.\n\n07:31.020 --> 07:32.020\nThat's true.\n\n07:32.020 --> 07:33.020\nThat's not what I mean.\n\n07:33.020 --> 07:39.020\nI just mean like in Aliens, you see Sigourney Weaver lights up a cigarette and of course the prop masters say,\n\n07:39.020 --> 07:42.020\nhey look, what is it going to be just like a marble red?\n\n07:42.020 --> 07:43.020\nNo, make it yellow.\n\n07:43.020 --> 07:44.020\nMake it yellow.\n\n07:44.020 --> 07:45.020\nMake it glow.\n\n07:45.020 --> 07:49.020\nThroughout history we've been trying to figure out something that Bogart would do.\n\n07:49.020 --> 07:52.020\nIf your movie's set in the future, we've experimented with varieties.\n\n07:52.020 --> 07:54.020\nNow we're living in the world.\n\n07:54.020 --> 07:56.020\nIt lights up with LEDs.\n\n07:56.020 --> 07:59.020\nIt lights up with LEDs and smoke comes out.\n\n07:59.020 --> 08:00.020\nIt's interesting.\n\n08:00.020 --> 08:04.020\nAnd also of course when you introduce technology into people's mania and addictions,\n\n08:04.020 --> 08:07.020\nyou're going to have people in their basement soupin' them up.\n\n08:07.020 --> 08:08.020\nThat's exactly what it is.\n\n08:08.020 --> 08:15.020\nYou've got it, but it's as opposed to, I mean I suppose there's an element of it that's the techies kind of up in the hills.\n\n08:15.020 --> 08:17.020\nAlright, what's your name?\n\n08:17.020 --> 08:18.020\nTyler.\n\n08:18.020 --> 08:19.020\nTyler.\n\n08:19.020 --> 08:25.020\nSo the big question for me is because my girlfriend came home today with e-cigarettes that she, as a non-smoker,\n\n08:25.020 --> 08:31.020\nI quit when I was 32 and I cannot, I quit, I made a deal with God that I cannot go back on.\n\n08:31.020 --> 08:32.020\nIt's probably a good idea.\n\n08:32.020 --> 08:36.020\nAs much as I'm tempted to, because these things will look interesting to me,\n\n08:36.020 --> 08:41.020\nI can't put one in my mouth because I don't know if God knows the difference.\n\n08:41.020 --> 08:42.020\nYeah?\n\n08:42.020 --> 08:45.020\nAnd what I want to know is, what is she inhaling?\n\n08:45.020 --> 08:48.020\nShe's like all, she's like, well it's zero nicotine.\n\n08:48.020 --> 08:50.020\nI'm like, yeah, but you're inhaling something.\n\n08:50.020 --> 08:52.020\nI looked online, it's like, basically it's like...\n\n08:52.020 --> 08:56.020\nSo there's nothing burning, I mean there's nothing that is turning into a carcinogen.\n\n08:56.020 --> 08:58.020\nYou're not setting something on fire and inhaling it.\n\n08:58.020 --> 09:02.020\nYou're turning a chemical into vapor.\n\n09:02.020 --> 09:05.020\nIt's basically like you said, like food coloring in there.\n\n09:05.020 --> 09:08.020\nI mean you're just, you're smoking food coloring with nicotine and flavor in it.\n\n09:08.020 --> 09:11.020\nBut it's not, you're not burning it, it's just turning into a vapor.\n\n09:11.020 --> 09:15.020\nYou hold down a button, it superheats a coil, you inhale it.\n\n09:15.020 --> 09:16.020\nYou're like, this is...\n\n09:16.020 --> 09:21.020\nAnd it said the FDA says that there's no significant health risks.\n\n09:21.020 --> 09:22.020\nAbsolutely.\n\n09:22.020 --> 09:23.020\nYeah, I mean it's...\n\n09:23.020 --> 09:25.020\nWe're talking about the zero nicotine.\n\n09:25.020 --> 09:28.020\nSir Walter Rawley said the same thing about tobacco.\n\n09:28.020 --> 09:30.020\nI mean, and the FDA says the same thing about...\n\n09:30.020 --> 09:32.020\nRight, it's somewhere in the...\n\n09:32.020 --> 09:36.020\nIt's somewhere in the thousands of magnitude as bad for you as a normal cigarette.\n\n09:36.020 --> 09:38.020\nYeah, a millionth, it's a millionth.\n\n09:38.020 --> 09:39.020\nOr more, yeah.\n\n09:39.020 --> 09:41.020\nSome of them have a one millionth of whatever.\n\n09:41.020 --> 09:44.020\nBut while we're on the topic and I have you up here, so you're a former smoker.\n\n09:44.020 --> 09:45.020\nYes.\n\n09:45.020 --> 09:48.020\nNow you're using e-cigarettes to quit or how long?\n\n09:48.020 --> 09:49.020\nIt's cheaper.\n\n09:49.020 --> 09:52.020\nI can do it at my desk at work.\n\n09:52.020 --> 09:53.020\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n09:53.020 --> 09:54.020\nIt's a thing.\n\n09:54.020 --> 09:56.020\nSo I mean, I work at a video game company.\n\n09:56.020 --> 09:57.020\nWe're kind of cool kids.\n\n09:57.020 --> 09:58.020\nDoes it really fulfill the craving?\n\n09:58.020 --> 09:59.020\nIt does, though.\n\n09:59.020 --> 10:01.020\nLook at him, he's ripped right now.\n\n10:01.020 --> 10:03.020\nHe's just jamming on nicotine then.\n\n10:03.020 --> 10:04.020\nHow do you know?\n\n10:04.020 --> 10:09.020\nBecause when I smoked, I quit at 32, you smoke down to the filter and then you put it out\n\n10:09.020 --> 10:12.020\nso you have that satisfaction of the progress indicator.\n\n10:12.020 --> 10:15.020\nSo, you know, I have friends of mine who are packet A smokers.\n\n10:15.020 --> 10:17.020\nI was never a packet A smoker.\n\n10:17.020 --> 10:20.020\nI would pack every couple days or maybe if I was out drinking a packet A.\n\n10:20.020 --> 10:23.020\nBut mostly, like, I would pack every few days.\n\n10:23.020 --> 10:25.020\nLike, I smoke just when I feel like it.\n\n10:25.020 --> 10:28.020\nI get a couple puffs of it and then that's it.\n\n10:28.020 --> 10:29.020\nOh, okay.\n\n10:29.020 --> 10:30.020\nThat's like, I feel like, oh, I'm good.\n\n10:30.020 --> 10:31.020\nWe're good.\n\n10:31.020 --> 10:32.020\nAll right.\n\n10:32.020 --> 10:35.020\nSo nicotine, I learned in biology class.\n\n10:35.020 --> 10:37.020\nI thought I remembered hearing this.\n\n10:37.020 --> 10:39.020\nI thought nicotine was the carcinogen.\n\n10:39.020 --> 10:43.020\nI thought that nicotine is a molecule that shaped like a roof shingle that flies like\n\n10:43.020 --> 10:49.020\na karate star into your lung tissue and has a one in a billion chance of cleaving your\n\n10:49.020 --> 10:52.020\ncellular membrane into your DNA.\n\n10:52.020 --> 10:58.020\nAnd just like, the reason why you eventually get lung cancer is because every puff you inhale\n\n10:58.020 --> 11:03.020\nof nicotine is a one in a zillion, billion, zillion, billion, billion chance of one of\n\n11:03.020 --> 11:08.020\nthese throwing stars like cutting the exact part of your double helix that makes the cell\n\n11:08.020 --> 11:10.020\ngo, I want to make more cells.\n\n11:10.020 --> 11:11.020\nPretty much.\n\n11:11.020 --> 11:14.020\nAnd nicotine in and of itself is fine.\n\n11:14.020 --> 11:17.020\nThat was a white trash guy, not a black guy.\n\n11:17.020 --> 11:18.020\nWell done.\n\n11:18.020 --> 11:19.020\nNicotine in and of itself is fine.\n\n11:19.020 --> 11:21.020\nCancer is not a black caricature.\n\n11:21.020 --> 11:24.020\nIt's a dirty, white, poor person.\n\n11:24.020 --> 11:25.020\nIt was a little racist.\n\n11:25.020 --> 11:27.020\nIt was not racist.\n\n11:27.020 --> 11:31.020\nWhat is the black enemy of the human genome?\n\n11:31.020 --> 11:34.020\nOh, do you want to hear black human genome?\n\n11:34.020 --> 11:35.020\nWhat he would sound like?\n\n11:35.020 --> 11:36.020\nExactly.\n\n11:36.020 --> 11:39.020\nI intend to create.\n\n11:39.020 --> 11:42.020\nI intend to do so responsibly.\n\n11:42.020 --> 11:45.020\nHe sounds like a very articulate gentleman.\n\n11:45.020 --> 11:47.020\nI woke up at nine this morning.\n\n11:47.020 --> 11:49.020\nI brushed my teeth.\n\n11:49.020 --> 11:52.020\nI have a wife that I love very much.\n\n11:52.020 --> 11:58.020\nAnd I oversee the reproduction of various viscera to keep the human body alive.\n\n11:58.020 --> 12:01.020\nWhat nationality is diabetes?\n\n12:01.020 --> 12:03.020\nItalian.\n\n12:03.020 --> 12:05.020\nDiabetes?\n\n12:05.020 --> 12:07.020\nOh, you never eat.\n\n12:07.020 --> 12:08.020\nI have a cake.\n\n12:08.020 --> 12:10.020\nI would have thought Hawaiian.\n\n12:10.020 --> 12:12.020\nOh, diabetes.\n\n12:12.020 --> 12:13.020\nOr Greek.\n\n12:13.020 --> 12:14.020\nIt seems Greek.\n\n12:14.020 --> 12:15.020\nIt seems pretty Greek.\n\n12:15.020 --> 12:22.020\nDiabetes stole sugar from Mount Olympus and was chained to a giant cake.\n\n12:22.020 --> 12:26.020\nAnd an eagle sticks a dipstick into his liver.\n\n12:26.020 --> 12:29.020\nNow, you said that Aaron came into your...\n\n12:29.020 --> 12:36.020\nA couple of Greek mythology majors just had a conniption fit.\n\n12:36.020 --> 12:38.020\nI don't think that's right.\n\n12:38.020 --> 12:41.020\nHe remembers the eagle.\n\n12:41.020 --> 12:45.020\nSo you said that Aaron got into your bed and she was singing the praises of e-cigarettes or what?\n\n12:45.020 --> 12:48.020\nShe came home with a bag because she wouldn't get antibiotics.\n\n12:48.020 --> 12:49.020\nShe came home.\n\n12:49.020 --> 12:52.020\nShe stopped at the gas station and by one of the ones there.\n\n12:52.020 --> 12:54.020\nI don't know where she was, but she came home.\n\n12:54.020 --> 12:56.020\nAnd I was just going like...\n\n12:56.020 --> 12:59.020\nLike I said, I'm eight years, no smoking.\n\n12:59.020 --> 13:01.020\nAnd I just flipped out.\n\n13:01.020 --> 13:05.020\nSo I started googling, even though I had writing to do.\n\n13:05.020 --> 13:09.020\nIt was ironic because while I was googling, there was this event that I'm describing earlier.\n\n13:09.020 --> 13:12.020\nI wasn't googling the right things.\n\n13:12.020 --> 13:15.020\nI just was like...\n\n13:15.020 --> 13:18.020\nI was typing in things like, the truth about e-cigarettes.\n\n13:18.020 --> 13:21.020\nThat always leads you somewhere nice.\n\n13:21.020 --> 13:23.020\nThe bottom line right now is basically like...\n\n13:23.020 --> 13:26.020\nIt kind of smells like a fog machine for a second.\n\n13:26.020 --> 13:30.020\nShe's in bed next to me and she has this little plastic stick that she sucks on.\n\n13:30.020 --> 13:34.020\nUnless you put your face in it, you're not going to get the scent of whatever the hell they flavored it with.\n\n13:34.020 --> 13:36.020\nAnd it's called vaping.\n\n13:36.020 --> 13:38.020\nAnd the kids are doing it.\n\n13:38.020 --> 13:40.020\nThey had to make a stupid verb out of it.\n\n13:40.020 --> 13:42.020\nI hate that term, really.\n\n13:42.020 --> 13:44.020\nI'm hanging out with this vaping.\n\n13:44.020 --> 13:46.020\nWhat are you doing?\n\n13:46.020 --> 13:47.020\nIt's the worst.\n\n13:47.020 --> 13:49.020\nCan you put drugs in them?\n\n13:49.020 --> 13:51.020\nCan you put weed or hash?\n\n13:51.020 --> 13:52.020\nThat's the worst thing.\n\n13:52.020 --> 13:54.020\nYou could probably put hash oil.\n\n13:54.020 --> 13:56.020\nIf you hacked one, you could probably put some of that hash oil.\n\n13:56.020 --> 13:58.020\nYou probably could.\n\n13:58.020 --> 14:01.020\nI'm just worried that they're going to ruin it for normal-looking people.\n\n14:01.020 --> 14:06.020\nThey have those hitters that are basically an e-cigarette, but you load them with hash oil.\n\n14:06.020 --> 14:08.020\nI was talking to someone who's the pot smoker about, and they were like,\n\n14:08.020 --> 14:11.020\nMan, no, because e-cigarettes, like, pot smokers, they're botanists, man.\n\n14:11.020 --> 14:14.020\nWe're not electronics, not so much.\n\n14:14.020 --> 14:19.020\nWell, this botanist got to hold on one of these hash oil things.\n\n14:19.020 --> 14:20.020\nI'm sure.\n\n14:20.020 --> 14:24.020\nI like sucking on a pen and putting it down and enjoying Zardaz.\n\n14:24.020 --> 14:26.020\nThat's what it takes, right?\n\n14:26.020 --> 14:27.020\nOne, two, three.\n\n14:27.020 --> 14:29.020\nWait, wait, you're on hash drink Zardaz?\n\n14:29.020 --> 14:30.020\nNo, no.\n\n14:30.020 --> 14:32.020\nGoddamn, that would be the worst.\n\n14:32.020 --> 14:33.020\nI was about to be so jealous.\n\n14:33.020 --> 14:35.020\nI was sober watching it, and that was...\n\n14:35.020 --> 14:39.020\nYeah, I watched it sober as a judge last night, and it was a bummer.\n\n14:39.020 --> 14:41.020\nAlright, tangent-free night.\n\n14:41.020 --> 14:43.020\nLet's thank Tyler and get him out of here.\n\n14:43.020 --> 14:44.020\nTyler!\n\n14:44.020 --> 14:48.020\nThe truth about e-cigarettes.\n\n14:48.020 --> 14:49.020\nNo tangents.\n\n14:49.020 --> 14:50.020\nWe're going to have an orderly night.\n\n14:50.020 --> 14:52.020\nThat was a brief one.\n\n14:52.020 --> 14:59.020\nSo, Erin is convalescing, but she wanted me to let you guys know, and I quote,\n\n14:59.020 --> 15:04.020\nand I don't know if this is because the tetanus has gone to her brain or...\n\n15:04.020 --> 15:07.020\nOr her e-cigarettes have been hacked.\n\n15:07.020 --> 15:10.020\nI feel like moving in with me is doing weird things to her brain chemistry.\n\n15:10.020 --> 15:11.020\nShe said,\n\n15:11.020 --> 15:15.020\nif any of you are getting married, she will make you a free wedding cake.\n\n15:15.020 --> 15:17.020\nErin, she's cake crazy.\n\n15:17.020 --> 15:24.020\nEvery 100% of the last 11 times I've been to your place has been a new cake.\n\n15:24.020 --> 15:29.020\nAnd then I went down, she literally has made two cakes now that are miscellaneous cakes.\n\n15:29.020 --> 15:34.020\nThe first one, we edited it out of the last episode because it wasn't very compelling audio-wise.\n\n15:34.020 --> 15:36.020\nFucker got a cake for his birthday here, right?\n\n15:36.020 --> 15:40.020\nIt was just, she just wrote, she'll make a cake, and then at a loss, she'll write,\n\n15:40.020 --> 15:41.020\nlike, yay!\n\n15:41.020 --> 15:45.020\nExclamation point on the cake, and then give it to me and go, bring this to work,\n\n15:45.020 --> 15:48.020\nand I'll bring it to work, and I'll go, yay!\n\n15:48.020 --> 15:50.020\nSo, how old did she get?\n\n15:50.020 --> 15:51.020\n28.\n\n15:51.020 --> 15:54.020\n28, that's too young for dementia, right?\n\n15:54.020 --> 15:59.020\nI mean, yeah, I mean, it's not too young to invent a new thing to be wrong with your brain.\n\n15:59.020 --> 16:05.020\nDan has, as we believe, we've spoken of his Game of Thrones party at Danadoo,\n\n16:05.020 --> 16:09.020\nand we were there last night, and Erin makes cakes that are drawings.\n\n16:09.020 --> 16:11.020\nLast week was Peter Dinklage.\n\n16:11.020 --> 16:17.020\nShe made a Dinklage that looked a lot like Cobain, but last night, she made a whip-ass Jon Snow.\n\n16:17.020 --> 16:19.020\nEven I knew it was Jon Snow, like, good Jon Snow.\n\n16:19.020 --> 16:20.020\nThat was a good Jon Snow.\n\n16:20.020 --> 16:26.020\nI went down to the kitchen to get some water, or get a glass of some water,\n\n16:26.020 --> 16:30.020\nand there's four other boxes of unmade cake mix.\n\n16:30.020 --> 16:33.020\nThere's proto-cakes already.\n\n16:33.020 --> 16:34.020\nShe's losing her mind.\n\n16:34.020 --> 16:35.020\nTwo words.\n\n16:35.020 --> 16:36.020\nCitizen Kane.\n\n16:36.020 --> 16:37.020\nRemember jigsaw puzzles?\n\n16:37.020 --> 16:39.020\nWell, yeah, you did call it Danadoo.\n\n16:39.020 --> 16:40.020\nYeah.\n\n16:40.020 --> 16:41.020\nIt's too close.\n\n16:41.020 --> 16:44.020\nI like to stand in the corner while she's making cakes in the shadows and go,\n\n16:44.020 --> 16:46.020\nwhy are you doing that?\n\n16:46.020 --> 16:48.020\nAnother cake.\n\n16:48.020 --> 16:52.020\nI make them because I like to make them.\n\n16:52.020 --> 16:53.020\nYou should change the line.\n\n16:53.020 --> 16:55.020\nYou make a cake, and then people eat it.\n\n16:55.020 --> 16:57.020\nWhat's the point?\n\n16:57.020 --> 17:00.020\nThere's empires out there, newspapers to own.\n\n17:00.020 --> 17:03.020\nI haven't seen Citizen Kane in a long time.\n\n17:03.020 --> 17:05.020\nI don't know what he said there.\n\n17:05.020 --> 17:06.020\nAll right.\n\n17:06.020 --> 17:08.020\nMoving right along.\n\n17:08.020 --> 17:09.020\nLet's knock this one off the list.\n\n17:09.020 --> 17:11.020\nHey, Alex, thank you for the Space Jam DVD.\n\n17:11.020 --> 17:12.020\nSome guy named Alex.\n\n17:12.020 --> 17:13.020\nOh, Jeremy.\n\n17:13.020 --> 17:14.020\nIt was Jeremy, wasn't it?\n\n17:14.020 --> 17:15.020\nJeremy.\n\n17:15.020 --> 17:18.020\nI'm holding a Space Jam DVD with a cigar post.\n\n17:18.020 --> 17:20.020\nThis is Jeremy on it.\n\n17:20.020 --> 17:22.020\nI have neither met nor heard of any of this.\n\n17:22.020 --> 17:23.020\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n17:23.020 --> 17:27.020\nHow did I get Alex out of Jeremy?\n\n17:27.020 --> 17:30.020\nAnd I'm making fun of my girlfriend for making cakes.\n\n17:30.020 --> 17:32.020\nAll I do is destroy lives.\n\n17:32.020 --> 17:33.020\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n17:33.020 --> 17:34.020\nSo what are we supposed to do?\n\n17:34.020 --> 17:35.020\nWho's Jeremy?\n\n17:35.020 --> 17:36.020\nJeremy, are you here?\n\n17:36.020 --> 17:37.020\nAll right.\n\n17:37.020 --> 17:38.020\nAlex, stand up.\n\n17:38.020 --> 17:39.020\nYou won a DVD.\n\n17:39.020 --> 17:40.020\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n17:40.020 --> 17:41.020\nOh, Jeremy.\n\n17:41.020 --> 17:42.020\nYou kept calling me on that other show.\n\n17:42.020 --> 17:43.020\nRight.\n\n17:43.020 --> 17:44.020\nWeird.\n\n17:44.020 --> 17:45.020\nI don't know.\n\n17:45.020 --> 17:47.020\nThere must be some dot in my head that's connected to Jeremy.\n\n17:47.020 --> 17:48.020\nWait, so this is a gift to Dan?\n\n17:48.020 --> 17:49.020\nNo.\n\n17:49.020 --> 17:52.020\nIt's a person who was talking about it on the other show.\n\n17:52.020 --> 17:55.020\nYou're supposed to do the show.\n\n17:55.020 --> 17:56.020\nOh, give it to her?\n\n17:56.020 --> 17:57.020\nYeah.\n\n17:57.020 --> 17:58.020\nOh, who was that girl?\n\n17:58.020 --> 18:01.020\nWho was the girl that came up and loved Space Jam?\n\n18:01.020 --> 18:02.020\nIt was your favorite movie.\n\n18:02.020 --> 18:03.020\nThat was days ago.\n\n18:03.020 --> 18:05.020\nI want to say Lizette.\n\n18:05.020 --> 18:07.020\nNo, that was yes, though.\n\n18:07.020 --> 18:09.020\nShe's not here, is she?\n\n18:09.020 --> 18:10.020\nI think it was...\n\n18:10.020 --> 18:13.020\nThere was a Space Jam apologist among you people.\n\n18:13.020 --> 18:14.020\nSo, she'll turn up.\n\n18:14.020 --> 18:15.020\nAll right.\n\n18:15.020 --> 18:17.020\nWell, Jeremy, you brought this for her?\n\n18:17.020 --> 18:19.020\nWell, I brought it for the show.\n\n18:19.020 --> 18:21.020\nAre you trying to fuck...\n\n18:21.020 --> 18:23.020\nSpace Jam, man.\n\n18:23.020 --> 18:27.020\nThis is the most elaborate come-on I've ever seen in my life.\n\n18:27.020 --> 18:28.020\nWell, then.\n\n18:28.020 --> 18:30.020\nHe's trying to fuck Harmontown.\n\n18:30.020 --> 18:31.020\nHe's Goldberg-ing.\n\n18:31.020 --> 18:34.020\nAdam, hey, Adam, are your brothers okay?\n\n18:34.020 --> 18:36.020\nThey're in Boston, right?\n\n18:36.020 --> 18:37.020\nYeah.\n\n18:37.020 --> 18:38.020\nAll right.\n\n18:38.020 --> 18:42.020\nBut don't pop the quirk on all the Boston talk.\n\n18:42.020 --> 18:44.020\nI want to bring up Camille and talk about it.\n\n18:44.020 --> 18:47.020\nAdam Goldberg, everybody.\n\n18:47.020 --> 18:49.020\nAll right.\n\n18:49.020 --> 18:50.020\nFirst things first.\n\n18:50.020 --> 18:52.020\nThere's a giant Velcro...\n\n18:52.020 --> 18:53.020\nBack brace.\n\n18:53.020 --> 18:54.020\nBack brace, okay.\n\n18:54.020 --> 18:55.020\nIt gets attached to something.\n\n18:55.020 --> 18:56.020\nWhat happened?\n\n18:56.020 --> 18:57.020\nYeah.\n\n18:57.020 --> 18:59.020\nYou know how I kept saying I had a job\n\n18:59.020 --> 19:01.020\nand I wasn't going to come to Harmontown anymore?\n\n19:01.020 --> 19:02.020\nYeah, yeah.\n\n19:02.020 --> 19:05.020\nWell, one of those is true and one of those is false.\n\n19:05.020 --> 19:07.020\nYou're on the false one.\n\n19:07.020 --> 19:10.020\nYou're like both Dory's and the Labyrinth.\n\n19:10.020 --> 19:12.020\nThe false one is you not coming here anymore.\n\n19:12.020 --> 19:13.020\nYeah.\n\n19:13.020 --> 19:14.020\nAll right.\n\n19:14.020 --> 19:17.020\nBut I didn't lose my job because I had workman's comp\n\n19:17.020 --> 19:18.020\nand didn't get injured.\n\n19:18.020 --> 19:19.020\nThat was a tortured sentence.\n\n19:19.020 --> 19:21.020\nI also had a true false.\n\n19:21.020 --> 19:23.020\nMy brothers are fine.\n\n19:23.020 --> 19:30.020\nMy college went into lockdown and we had domestic terrorism\n\n19:30.020 --> 19:34.020\nin my fair city, Boston, which I'm not going to talk about\n\n19:34.020 --> 19:36.020\nuntil Camille gets here.\n\n19:36.020 --> 19:39.020\nYour role, not mine.\n\n19:39.020 --> 19:42.020\nWere your brothers able to get a hold of you?\n\n19:42.020 --> 19:43.020\nYeah.\n\n19:43.020 --> 19:44.020\nBecause it's totally locked down.\n\n19:44.020 --> 19:47.020\nYeah, they just faced so many other ways to connect\n\n19:47.020 --> 19:49.020\nto people that aren't cell phones.\n\n19:49.020 --> 19:50.020\nYeah, that's true, isn't it?\n\n19:50.020 --> 19:52.020\nJust got text, got an email, got all this stuff.\n\n19:52.020 --> 19:56.020\nThe police have put an IM lockdown on the city of Boston.\n\n19:56.020 --> 19:58.020\nAIM is completely down.\n\n19:58.020 --> 20:01.020\nICQ is not working due to the high call volume.\n\n20:01.020 --> 20:03.020\nOnly emoticons are able to get through.\n\n20:03.020 --> 20:05.020\nPeople are winking at each other.\n\n20:05.020 --> 20:10.020\nI posted on Facebook today that there's a tragedy in my hometown\n\n20:10.020 --> 20:13.020\nand Facebook is like, do you want to add a smiley to this?\n\n20:13.020 --> 20:17.020\nThree people have been vaporized by bombs in a place\n\n20:17.020 --> 20:18.020\nyou used to go to get coffee.\n\n20:18.020 --> 20:20.020\nHow about a winky face?\n\n20:20.020 --> 20:23.020\nThat's Facebook's line, not mine.\n\n20:23.020 --> 20:25.020\nI want that to be a jet pack.\n\n20:25.020 --> 20:28.020\nI want it to be a battery pack.\n\n20:28.020 --> 20:31.020\nFor our listeners, Adam has taken off his gray hoodie\n\n20:31.020 --> 20:34.020\nand revealed what can only be described as a girdle.\n\n20:34.020 --> 20:39.020\nI was going to say, it's trust-like.\n\n20:39.020 --> 20:41.020\nBefore you took your hoodie off,\n\n20:41.020 --> 20:45.020\nI was about to ask you how you stay so thin.\n\n20:45.020 --> 20:46.020\nRunning from bombs.\n\n20:46.020 --> 20:47.020\nNo.\n\n20:47.020 --> 20:49.020\nI can make that joke.\n\n20:49.020 --> 20:50.020\nAdam, see?\n\n20:50.020 --> 20:51.020\nThat's why I...\n\n20:51.020 --> 20:53.020\nThat's the one line you can't cross.\n\n20:53.020 --> 20:54.020\nAlso the finish line.\n\n20:54.020 --> 20:55.020\nYou can't cross.\n\n20:55.020 --> 20:56.020\nHoly shit!\n\n20:56.020 --> 20:57.020\nHey-o!\n\n20:57.020 --> 20:59.020\nI can very...\n\n20:59.020 --> 21:07.020\nWill you please just put the pedal to the metal and do more Boston bombing jokes?\n\n21:07.020 --> 21:10.020\nJust Basie Barrett, just give it all.\n\n21:10.020 --> 21:12.020\nIt's really embarrassing for me\n\n21:12.020 --> 21:17.020\nbecause this has been 20 years since Boston's last race riot.\n\n21:17.020 --> 21:20.020\nIt's a little embarrassing history for Bostonians.\n\n21:20.020 --> 21:23.020\nJust connecting verbal dots.\n\n21:23.020 --> 21:26.020\nThere's people rolling around in agony.\n\n21:26.020 --> 21:29.020\nYou're just like, this word reminds me of another word.\n\n21:29.020 --> 21:32.020\nYou also say Boston's...\n\n21:32.020 --> 21:37.020\nYou say Boston's last race riot with the sound of inevitability for the next one.\n\n21:37.020 --> 21:43.020\nIf you've seen how we've treated any athletic star who can't pass the paper bag test,\n\n21:43.020 --> 21:50.020\nyou know Boston is a good place for race riot sounds like athletic race riot jokes.\n\n21:50.020 --> 21:52.020\nNow, by the time this podcast airs,\n\n21:52.020 --> 21:55.020\nyou will be able to assemble that last sentence\n\n21:55.020 --> 21:57.020\nby going back several times,\n\n21:57.020 --> 21:59.020\nbut I believe that you'll...\n\n21:59.020 --> 22:02.020\nWait, are you saying you were involved in that?\n\n22:02.020 --> 22:04.020\nYeah, it's a tragedy,\n\n22:04.020 --> 22:07.020\nbut at some point, as a comedian,\n\n22:07.020 --> 22:09.020\nyour brain just automatically makes terrible,\n\n22:09.020 --> 22:12.020\njazzle-necky-and-jokes about it.\n\n22:12.020 --> 22:14.020\nYou just go to the jazzle mix in Illinois.\n\n22:14.020 --> 22:16.020\nI mean, it's a tragedy,\n\n22:16.020 --> 22:19.020\nbut to heap tragic comedy on top of it.\n\n22:19.020 --> 22:24.020\nLike, bombs are bad, puns are worse.\n\n22:24.020 --> 22:28.020\nI thought I'd come up here and bomb on the other...\n\n22:28.020 --> 22:33.020\nI thought I'd come up here and show that not all the bombs are in Boston.\n\n22:33.020 --> 22:34.020\nThank you.\n\n22:34.020 --> 22:35.020\nAll right, Adam Wilber.\n\n22:35.020 --> 22:37.020\nIt was worth a try.\n\n22:40.020 --> 22:42.020\nGet well soon, would you?\n\n22:44.020 --> 22:45.020\nYo.\n\n22:46.020 --> 22:47.020\nOh, thank you.\n\n22:47.020 --> 22:50.020\nGentlemen, just compliment my haircut.\n\n22:50.020 --> 22:51.020\nThat was very pleasant.\n\n22:51.020 --> 22:54.020\nThank you, sir. You're not so bad yourself.\n\n22:54.020 --> 22:56.020\nThat was an interesting social phenomenon.\n\n22:56.020 --> 22:57.020\nAdam Goldberg embodied it,\n\n22:57.020 --> 22:59.020\nwhich before the Internet,\n\n22:59.020 --> 23:00.020\nwhen I was a kid,\n\n23:00.020 --> 23:06.020\nI remember when this grade of national tragedy would happen,\n\n23:06.020 --> 23:09.020\nmy mind goes back to the space shuttle Challenger.\n\n23:09.020 --> 23:11.020\nThe next day on the playground,\n\n23:11.020 --> 23:13.020\nthere's all this conversation about it,\n\n23:13.020 --> 23:16.020\nand then there's the six jokes that everybody...\n\n23:16.020 --> 23:18.020\nAnd they're just awful.\n\n23:18.020 --> 23:19.020\nAnd they're almost like...\n\n23:19.020 --> 23:20.020\nThey're vicious, too.\n\n23:20.020 --> 23:22.020\nAre they vicious, or are they kind of like...\n\n23:22.020 --> 23:24.020\nHere's the thing.\n\n23:24.020 --> 23:27.020\nThey're not funny enough to be okay.\n\n23:27.020 --> 23:29.020\nIf you're going to tell a funny joke after 9-11,\n\n23:29.020 --> 23:32.020\nit has to be a beautifully crafted joke.\n\n23:32.020 --> 23:34.020\nLike Warren Thomas had a goodie.\n\n23:34.020 --> 23:38.020\nWell, they have to be beautifully crafted to what end, though,\n\n23:38.020 --> 23:41.020\nbecause no one wants to actually laugh about it.\n\n23:41.020 --> 23:44.020\nLike if Oscar Wilde said something piffy about it,\n\n23:44.020 --> 23:45.020\npeople are getting blowed up.\n\n23:45.020 --> 23:47.020\nIt has to create release to go like...\n\n23:47.020 --> 23:49.020\nIt's not diminishing it.\n\n23:49.020 --> 23:51.020\nIt's saying, like, here's the pressure valve.\n\n23:51.020 --> 23:53.020\nAnd just for a second, I go...\n\n23:53.020 --> 23:55.020\nThere's a rodeo clown effect there.\n\n23:55.020 --> 23:59.020\nBut that's not an apt metaphor,\n\n23:59.020 --> 24:01.020\nbecause I think we all know that rodeo clowns\n\n24:01.020 --> 24:03.020\nare like really superior,\n\n24:03.020 --> 24:07.020\nlike kind of like bull handlers.\n\n24:07.020 --> 24:09.020\nThose are the real craftsmen, blah, blah, blah.\n\n24:09.020 --> 24:11.020\nThere's someone raising their hand.\n\n24:11.020 --> 24:13.020\nBenign violation theory.\n\n24:13.020 --> 24:14.020\nWhat's that?\n\n24:14.020 --> 24:15.020\nBenign violation theory.\n\n24:15.020 --> 24:16.020\nWould you like to come up?\n\n24:16.020 --> 24:18.020\nGet the fuck up here with that, yeah.\n\n24:18.020 --> 24:19.020\nIt's a town meeting.\n\n24:19.020 --> 24:22.020\nHarmontown's got new life briefs into it.\n\n24:22.020 --> 24:25.020\nYeah, if you're going to say three words that interesting,\n\n24:25.020 --> 24:27.020\nyou have to come up with it.\n\n24:27.020 --> 24:29.020\nThe divine violation theory?\n\n24:29.020 --> 24:30.020\nNo, no, no. Benign.\n\n24:30.020 --> 24:31.020\nBenign?\n\n24:31.020 --> 24:32.020\nYeah.\n\n24:32.020 --> 24:33.020\nViolation theory.\n\n24:33.020 --> 24:35.020\nI think as a Harvard professor,\n\n24:35.020 --> 24:38.020\nI came up with this theory that in order for humor to be funny,\n\n24:38.020 --> 24:41.020\nit has to be benign and deviant.\n\n24:41.020 --> 24:44.020\nIf it doesn't fulfill both of those things, it isn't funny.\n\n24:44.020 --> 24:47.020\nBecause if it's not benign, you see it as a threat.\n\n24:47.020 --> 24:48.020\nRight.\n\n24:48.020 --> 24:50.020\nAnd if it's not deviant, it's boring.\n\n24:50.020 --> 24:51.020\nDeviant in which way?\n\n24:51.020 --> 24:53.020\nDeviant as in...\n\n24:53.020 --> 24:56.020\nFrom the accepted path.\n\n24:56.020 --> 24:59.020\nSo can you give us a, for instance, is there a...\n\n24:59.020 --> 25:01.020\nCan you pull one out?\n\n25:01.020 --> 25:03.020\nAnd in the case...\n\n25:03.020 --> 25:05.020\nSo to continue this theory,\n\n25:05.020 --> 25:08.020\nI think we can also benign, but deviant things are easier to do\n\n25:08.020 --> 25:12.020\nwhen they're not in the face of something as sobering\n\n25:12.020 --> 25:14.020\nas a national tragedy.\n\n25:14.020 --> 25:17.020\nAnd that is why when these very serious things happen\n\n25:17.020 --> 25:20.020\nthat everyone can agree are very serious and painful,\n\n25:20.020 --> 25:22.020\nactually the worst kind of...\n\n25:22.020 --> 25:25.020\nAnd when I say worst, I don't mean the most caustic,\n\n25:25.020 --> 25:30.020\nthe most tough crowd with Colin Quinney.\n\n25:30.020 --> 25:34.020\nI mean the dumbest, the fozibarriest,\n\n25:34.020 --> 25:37.020\nlike, punniest, dumbest kind of jokes come out\n\n25:37.020 --> 25:40.020\nbecause in order to prove that they're benign\n\n25:40.020 --> 25:46.020\nin the face of flesh being torn and the unignorable stink\n\n25:46.020 --> 25:49.020\nof political motivation in the air\n\n25:49.020 --> 25:52.020\nand not to mention the political motivation\n\n25:52.020 --> 25:55.020\nthat's going to be cultivated from it.\n\n25:55.020 --> 26:01.020\nIn order to be benign, you have to be pretty stupid.\n\n26:01.020 --> 26:05.020\nThe joke has to be just dumb as bricks.\n\n26:05.020 --> 26:08.020\nWell, let's consider everybody loves Raymond.\n\n26:08.020 --> 26:11.020\nNot funny to most of us, right?\n\n26:11.020 --> 26:14.020\nI've actually never seen an episode of it, I don't know.\n\n26:14.020 --> 26:17.020\nWell, there is a demographic that sees his humor\n\n26:17.020 --> 26:19.020\nas deviating from the norm.\n\n26:19.020 --> 26:21.020\nYeah.\n\n26:21.020 --> 26:24.020\nLet's all pray for them tonight.\n\n26:27.020 --> 26:30.020\nYou did it. That was benign and deviant.\n\n26:30.020 --> 26:32.020\nYou did it.\n\n26:32.020 --> 26:34.020\nI'm sorry, continue. I didn't mean to derail you.\n\n26:34.020 --> 26:37.020\nNo, no, that was the only example I could think about.\n\n26:37.020 --> 26:39.020\nI'm sorry.\n\n26:39.020 --> 26:41.020\nWell, wait, no, but it seems like you were building to a point.\n\n26:41.020 --> 26:43.020\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n26:43.020 --> 26:45.020\nYou're just saying that it's a contextual thing.\n\n26:45.020 --> 26:47.020\nIt's a subjective thing.\n\n26:47.020 --> 26:50.020\nTo my mom, deviation is like not kneeling\n\n26:50.020 --> 26:53.020\nand my mom doesn't kneel anywhere.\n\n26:53.020 --> 26:57.020\nTo my mythical mom, to grandma.\n\n26:57.020 --> 26:59.020\nYeah, there's no joke that you could say\n\n26:59.020 --> 27:01.020\nthat would be funny to everybody across the board\n\n27:01.020 --> 27:03.020\nin the face of a crisis.\n\n27:03.020 --> 27:05.020\nWhat was your name, sir?\n\n27:05.020 --> 27:07.020\nOkay, Bill. Well, let's thank Bill\n\n27:07.020 --> 27:09.020\nbecause we got so much things. Thank you, Bill.\n\n27:09.020 --> 27:11.020\nAll right.\n\n27:11.020 --> 27:15.020\nIt's the theory of benign deviance.\n\n27:15.020 --> 27:17.020\nI mean, yeah.\n\n27:17.020 --> 27:20.020\nYeah, like, I think that's interesting\n\n27:20.020 --> 27:22.020\nbecause the jokes get dumber\n\n27:22.020 --> 27:27.020\nwhen the tragedy is unmistakable.\n\n27:27.020 --> 27:31.020\nAnd, you know, that theory, such as it is a theory.\n\n27:31.020 --> 27:34.020\nI want to say this. By no means do I want this to be funny.\n\n27:34.020 --> 27:36.020\nIt's not a joke. I'm not saying it's a joke.\n\n27:36.020 --> 27:38.020\nI do not want a joke as a response to this.\n\n27:38.020 --> 27:40.020\nBut there are people when you watch the footage\n\n27:40.020 --> 27:43.020\nof the marathon runners coming across the finish line.\n\n27:43.020 --> 27:45.020\nSome of them are just coming across the finish line\n\n27:45.020 --> 27:47.020\nwhen things go boom.\n\n27:47.020 --> 27:49.020\nAnd for a split second, their hands are still in the air.\n\n27:49.020 --> 27:51.020\nThey don't know if that's fireworks going on.\n\n27:51.020 --> 27:53.020\nThey don't know what the fuck is going on.\n\n27:53.020 --> 27:55.020\nOther people are in front of it. They see debris.\n\n27:55.020 --> 27:57.020\nThey're running for the other side of the street.\n\n27:57.020 --> 27:59.020\nBut also, there are people that are probably going to finish\n\n27:59.020 --> 28:02.020\nin an hour, like they've been running for three or four hours.\n\n28:02.020 --> 28:04.020\nIt seems like, sorry, that three or four hours that you ran,\n\n28:04.020 --> 28:07.020\nlike the marathon is over.\n\n28:07.020 --> 28:11.020\nThat trickles back along a huge route, like a mile-long thing.\n\n28:11.020 --> 28:13.020\nIt's a very weird thing to go on.\n\n28:13.020 --> 28:15.020\nWait, how do you mean? What do you mean?\n\n28:15.020 --> 28:17.020\nThere's going to be somebody that's just going to,\n\n28:17.020 --> 28:19.020\nat some point you're running and it's going to stop you.\n\n28:19.020 --> 28:21.020\nThe marathon's over.\n\n28:21.020 --> 28:23.020\nSomebody blew up the finish line.\n\n28:23.020 --> 28:25.020\nThe experience of...\n\n28:25.020 --> 28:27.020\nYeah, I hadn't even thought about that.\n\n28:27.020 --> 28:31.020\nThe subjective experience of a person who is a mile from...\n\n28:31.020 --> 28:33.020\nDoing this thing that...\n\n28:33.020 --> 28:35.020\nWho has run 22 and a half miles.\n\n28:35.020 --> 28:37.020\nAnd they have every right and reason to believe\n\n28:37.020 --> 28:40.020\nthat what they're undergoing is this cataclysmic experience.\n\n28:40.020 --> 28:42.020\nI'm not saying that. I'm just saying that.\n\n28:42.020 --> 28:44.020\nThere's people that, your minds are wobbly.\n\n28:44.020 --> 28:46.020\nYour legs are wobbly.\n\n28:46.020 --> 28:48.020\nI think it was a guy that falls down in that footage.\n\n28:48.020 --> 28:51.020\nIn my mind, I don't know. It didn't look like he was hit.\n\n28:51.020 --> 28:54.020\nIt just looks like people's legs are about to give at that moment anyway.\n\n28:54.020 --> 28:56.020\nAnd he heard this big shock.\n\n28:56.020 --> 28:58.020\nI don't know if it was he or she, actually.\n\n28:58.020 --> 29:00.020\nAnd somebody just kind of tumbled to the ground.\n\n29:00.020 --> 29:03.020\nWell, I will say the thing that you said you're not saying,\n\n29:03.020 --> 29:05.020\nwhich is interesting to me.\n\n29:05.020 --> 29:07.020\nI'll be the bad guy and talk about this.\n\n29:07.020 --> 29:10.020\nBecause I remembered 9-11.\n\n29:10.020 --> 29:13.020\nAnd I remember this.\n\n29:13.020 --> 29:16.020\nPlease appreciate my candor and don't punish me\n\n29:16.020 --> 29:19.020\nfor communicating something about human psychology.\n\n29:19.020 --> 29:21.020\nBecause the easiest thing in the world for me\n\n29:21.020 --> 29:24.020\nwould be to not share this with you and be a good person.\n\n29:24.020 --> 29:28.020\nBut the year that 9-11 happened,\n\n29:28.020 --> 29:31.020\nthere were Emmys same as every year.\n\n29:31.020 --> 29:35.020\nOnly the year that 9-11 happened, because there was 9-11,\n\n29:35.020 --> 29:38.020\nthe Emmys were downplayed.\n\n29:38.020 --> 29:41.020\nThere was no red carpet, for instance.\n\n29:41.020 --> 29:43.020\nIt's funny how that national psychology happens.\n\n29:43.020 --> 29:45.020\nIt's like, yeah, I guess it makes sense.\n\n29:45.020 --> 29:46.020\nLike, what are we supposed to do?\n\n29:46.020 --> 29:48.020\n9-11 just happened.\n\n29:48.020 --> 29:51.020\nLet's not roll out. Let's not watch Jennifer Aniston\n\n29:51.020 --> 29:53.020\ntalk about what she's wearing.\n\n29:53.020 --> 29:56.020\nNot because it has anything to do with anything,\n\n29:56.020 --> 29:59.020\nbut just because it just doesn't seem right.\n\n29:59.020 --> 30:01.020\nAnd I agree with that.\n\n30:01.020 --> 30:03.020\nIt's odd.\n\n30:03.020 --> 30:06.020\nAnd yet, I live in this universe where it's like,\n\n30:06.020 --> 30:10.020\nthat's the most important thing in the world, the Emmys.\n\n30:10.020 --> 30:15.020\nAnd my mind went there when I thought about all the writers\n\n30:15.020 --> 30:18.020\nwho were nominated and not nominated\n\n30:18.020 --> 30:20.020\nand nominated hoping to win\n\n30:20.020 --> 30:22.020\nor not having a chance to win.\n\n30:22.020 --> 30:26.020\nAnd I'm just thinking about the lives building to this point\n\n30:26.020 --> 30:33.020\nand then this 9-11 thing, like making their Emmys like not a thing.\n\n30:33.020 --> 30:36.020\nI was just thinking of like, it's not a proud thing.\n\n30:36.020 --> 30:39.020\nIt's just like humanity consists of two things.\n\n30:39.020 --> 30:43.020\nIt consists of a big throng of gelatinous,\n\n30:43.020 --> 30:45.020\nlike societal collective.\n\n30:45.020 --> 30:48.020\nAnd it exists of all these little remarkable little snowflakes.\n\n30:48.020 --> 30:50.020\nAlso, their own little egos and their own little motivations.\n\n30:50.020 --> 30:53.020\nThe motivation was for the people or persons that did this thing.\n\n30:53.020 --> 31:00.020\nWhat a fucking crappy thing to do is bomb the stands at the finish line of a race.\n\n31:00.020 --> 31:03.020\nWhere it's going to almost certainly be friends and family.\n\n31:03.020 --> 31:06.020\nLike people that mean nobody any fucking harm at all.\n\n31:06.020 --> 31:08.020\nWhere are you gonna...\n\n31:08.020 --> 31:11.020\nI mean, I just like...\n\n31:11.020 --> 31:14.020\nI don't know why I'm having that.\n\n31:14.020 --> 31:16.020\nIt's another funny thing that I wanted to talk about.\n\n31:16.020 --> 31:18.020\nI was standing at the foot of Aaron's bed,\n\n31:18.020 --> 31:21.020\nlaid up with her, she's gonna take antibiotics and not come to the show.\n\n31:21.020 --> 31:25.020\nAnd she mentioned Boston and I was up the door.\n\n31:25.020 --> 31:27.020\nI was like, so nobody knows what's going on.\n\n31:27.020 --> 31:32.020\nAnd I suddenly realized that I had an opinion.\n\n31:32.020 --> 31:36.020\nI'm telling you, I'm completely sealed off from the entire thing.\n\n31:36.020 --> 31:39.020\nI could tell you in 15 seconds,\n\n31:39.020 --> 31:41.020\neverything that I've actually heard about this,\n\n31:41.020 --> 31:43.020\nbecause even in the green room I was telling people don't,\n\n31:43.020 --> 31:47.020\nbecause I think it's actually weird that I was in a bubble today\n\n31:47.020 --> 31:52.020\nand I only know multiple bombs went off at the finish line of the Boston Marathon\n\n31:52.020 --> 31:56.020\nand scores hundreds of people are horribly injured\n\n31:56.020 --> 31:58.020\nand that there's all kinds of gore all over the internet\n\n31:58.020 --> 32:01.020\nand that three people are confirmed dead and one of them's a kid.\n\n32:01.020 --> 32:04.020\nSo I know all that and I know that everybody's trying to figure out\n\n32:04.020 --> 32:06.020\nwhat the fuck happened and that there's a huge blackout,\n\n32:06.020 --> 32:10.020\nthat cell phones are blacked out because cell phones can be used to activate bombs.\n\n32:10.020 --> 32:14.020\nAnd then I found out in the green room that there's more bombs.\n\n32:14.020 --> 32:17.020\nBut I want to bring Camille up in a second because he specifically,\n\n32:17.020 --> 32:20.020\nhe was the opposite of me today.\n\n32:20.020 --> 32:24.020\nHe was on Twitter and he was telling me before the show\n\n32:24.020 --> 32:28.020\nabout how his subjective truth was changing every 30 minutes.\n\n32:28.020 --> 32:33.020\nBut I just wanted to say one thing that I thought was so strange psychologically\n\n32:33.020 --> 32:37.020\nas I was standing at the foot of our bed about to leave for the show\n\n32:37.020 --> 32:42.020\nand Aaron mentioned something about Boston and I must have said something like,\n\n32:42.020 --> 32:44.020\ndo they know? Do they know who did it yet?\n\n32:44.020 --> 32:46.020\nAnd she's like, no.\n\n32:46.020 --> 32:52.020\nAnd I said something like, I don't know, this doesn't seem very al-Qaeda-ish.\n\n32:52.020 --> 32:55.020\nAnd I'm like, what am I, Bruce Wayne now?\n\n32:55.020 --> 32:59.020\nWho the fuck do I, what am I talking about?\n\n32:59.020 --> 33:01.020\nI just think that's such a funny thing.\n\n33:01.020 --> 33:04.020\nI had to turn the news off because in that whirlwind,\n\n33:04.020 --> 33:07.020\nright after a big event happens, it's an earthquake or it's a robbery\n\n33:07.020 --> 33:11.020\nor Charlie Sheen makes a phone call or whatever.\n\n33:11.020 --> 33:14.020\nNobody has any facts, so it's a lot of allege.\n\n33:14.020 --> 33:18.020\nBut then in my brain immediately without any like five seconds\n\n33:18.020 --> 33:22.020\nand my brain chemistry is immediately I'm Val Kilmer sitting in front of a bank of computer.\n\n33:22.020 --> 33:24.020\nThis isn't the Riddler's style.\n\n33:24.020 --> 33:30.020\nWhy am I on the case? Why is my brain on the case at all?\n\n33:30.020 --> 33:32.020\nDumb, stupid.\n\n33:32.020 --> 33:35.020\nWhy isn't your brain not on the case?\n\n33:35.020 --> 33:38.020\nBut why in this comic book world?\n\n33:38.020 --> 33:40.020\nWhy isn't my brain on the case of who can I help?\n\n33:40.020 --> 33:42.020\nWho do you think did it?\n\n33:42.020 --> 33:44.020\nI'm not being glib again.\n\n33:44.020 --> 33:48.020\nIf you had to guess right now, what do you think is the motive or are the people responsible?\n\n33:48.020 --> 33:52.020\nAnd I'm not being, I mean, and Erin said this in response,\n\n33:52.020 --> 33:56.020\nshe said, she said kind of like she was intrigued by the thought presence\n\n33:56.020 --> 34:02.020\nof like, because it's too specific, you know, it's too, it's like, what, you are,\n\n34:02.020 --> 34:04.020\nwe should bring Camille up.\n\n34:04.020 --> 34:06.020\nI think we want to talk to him about this.\n\n34:06.020 --> 34:19.020\nI didn't want to go too much further down this road because I feel like, I, I, I, I, all of a sudden,\n\n34:19.020 --> 34:23.020\nthe human mind is incredible.\n\n34:23.020 --> 34:28.020\nI mean, we're cavemen that were able to create stories out of the fact that we live and die.\n\n34:28.020 --> 34:33.020\nIn a vacuum, we do what cheetahs and giraffes and mosquitoes do.\n\n34:33.020 --> 34:36.020\nWe come into a world, we realize we're in it, and then we go away.\n\n34:36.020 --> 34:43.020\nBut unlike giraffes and cheetahs and mosquitoes, in the span of time that we're here,\n\n34:43.020 --> 34:46.020\nwe go, oh, you hear that thunder?\n\n34:46.020 --> 34:48.020\nThat thunder is Zeus.\n\n34:48.020 --> 34:50.020\nHe's been rollerskating again.\n\n34:50.020 --> 34:52.020\nAnd the kids go, what's the rollerskating?\n\n34:52.020 --> 34:54.020\nAnd we go, well, rollerskating is what happens when it's done.\n\n34:54.020 --> 34:56.020\nAnd we just fill our heads.\n\n34:56.020 --> 35:02.020\nOur brains branch out and we create beauty and poetry and dancing and festivals\n\n35:02.020 --> 35:05.020\nand, and, and we reach out, we touch each other, we save each other's lives,\n\n35:05.020 --> 35:11.020\nwe take bullets for each other, but we also, we go like, well, you know, black people.\n\n35:11.020 --> 35:15.020\nYou know, you put one on a drive-thru and you know, you know, we have that.\n\n35:15.020 --> 35:17.020\nThat's a new one.\n\n35:17.020 --> 35:20.020\nThat same computer is constantly.\n\n35:20.020 --> 35:22.020\nI didn't know about black Netherlands drive-thru.\n\n35:22.020 --> 35:24.020\nYou've never been behind a black person in a drive-thru.\n\n35:24.020 --> 35:28.020\nWhat are they doing?\n\n35:28.020 --> 35:30.020\nWhat are the black people doing in drive-thru?\n\n35:30.020 --> 35:32.020\nI wish I could tell you, but we got so much to do tonight.\n\n35:32.020 --> 35:33.020\nWhat?\n\n35:33.020 --> 35:34.020\nNo tangents. No tangents.\n\n35:34.020 --> 35:36.020\nShoot it next week.\n\n35:36.020 --> 35:41.020\nIt's interesting because the mic stand broke off.\n\n35:41.020 --> 35:45.020\nFirst of all, to answer your question, I hope it's a crazy white guy\n\n35:45.020 --> 35:49.020\nor like an Asian lady because we haven't seen them do\n\n35:49.020 --> 35:51.020\njust for the novelty of it.\n\n35:51.020 --> 35:56.020\nAnd also I just don't want it to be a brown person again.\n\n35:56.020 --> 35:58.020\nI really don't.\n\n35:58.020 --> 36:01.020\nWhat horse do you have on this race?\n\n36:01.020 --> 36:05.020\nI just want any of the horses that are not brown.\n\n36:05.020 --> 36:08.020\nI don't know, are they winning the race? What's going on?\n\n36:08.020 --> 36:14.020\nFirst of all, my race riot puns have been taken.\n\n36:14.020 --> 36:17.020\nYeah, so that's a real thing if you are...\n\n36:17.020 --> 36:19.020\nWell, here's the thing.\n\n36:19.020 --> 36:22.020\nIf it's like a crazy white guy, then it's just a crazy white guy.\n\n36:22.020 --> 36:26.020\nIf it's a crazy brown guy, then it's a fucking conspiracy and all.\n\n36:26.020 --> 36:28.020\nIt turns this whole thing.\n\n36:28.020 --> 36:30.020\nI just want it to be not...\n\n36:30.020 --> 36:34.020\nI was thinking how frustrating it would be if you were just like a McVeigh,\n\n36:34.020 --> 36:40.020\na unabomber, manifesto kind of crazy guy who just happens to be from Saudi Arabia.\n\n36:40.020 --> 36:41.020\nHe'd be so...\n\n36:41.020 --> 36:43.020\nBecause everyone's like, oh yeah, of course he's Al-Qaeda.\n\n36:43.020 --> 36:46.020\nHe's like, no, I've got my own thing going on.\n\n36:46.020 --> 36:48.020\nHe's like, read my manifesto.\n\n36:48.020 --> 36:50.020\nYou mean the Quran? No.\n\n36:50.020 --> 36:52.020\nI don't even... I'm an atheist.\n\n36:52.020 --> 36:54.020\nNo, my mom gave it to me.\n\n36:54.020 --> 36:56.020\nShe gave it to me. I'm not religious.\n\n36:56.020 --> 36:58.020\nI'm just like, honey bees are going to take over the hummingbirds.\n\n36:58.020 --> 37:01.020\nBut I'm way crazier than you think I am.\n\n37:01.020 --> 37:05.020\nThis is not institutionalized craziness.\n\n37:05.020 --> 37:08.020\nBut if you're a crazy manifesto guy that lives in Saudi Arabia,\n\n37:08.020 --> 37:11.020\nbut you're also lazy, you're like, I'm on Easy Street.\n\n37:11.020 --> 37:13.020\nI walk right into this one.\n\n37:13.020 --> 37:15.020\nYou know what this vein of gold is?\n\n37:15.020 --> 37:18.020\nIt's benign and deviant.\n\n37:18.020 --> 37:22.020\nIt's a safe pocket away from anyone mistaking us\n\n37:22.020 --> 37:25.020\nfor not, you know, having our prayers in grief\n\n37:25.020 --> 37:27.020\nwith the families of the loved ones.\n\n37:27.020 --> 37:29.020\nSorry, I ruined it.\n\n37:29.020 --> 37:31.020\nBut it makes sense what you're saying.\n\n37:31.020 --> 37:33.020\nWhat Adam was doing, when you make like base jokes\n\n37:33.020 --> 37:36.020\nwhen something big, when you perceive to be big happens,\n\n37:36.020 --> 37:39.020\nit's because you're trying to make sense of the world.\n\n37:39.020 --> 37:41.020\nIt's the same as saying that thunder is loose.\n\n37:41.020 --> 37:43.020\nYou're trying to put structure on it.\n\n37:43.020 --> 37:45.020\nSo if something happens that you can't understand,\n\n37:45.020 --> 37:47.020\nwell, if you make a joke about it, then it becomes smaller,\n\n37:47.020 --> 37:49.020\nsomething you can process, something you can have.\n\n37:49.020 --> 37:52.020\nAnd here's the thing that I think is really interesting about that.\n\n37:52.020 --> 37:54.020\nWell, everything's interesting about it.\n\n37:54.020 --> 37:56.020\nWhy do I have to point out one thing that's interesting about it?\n\n37:56.020 --> 37:58.020\nBut the thing that captivates me about it\n\n37:58.020 --> 38:02.020\nis that it's a channel to accountability.\n\n38:02.020 --> 38:06.020\nA six-year-old on a playground making a joke about Liberace dying of AIDS\n\n38:06.020 --> 38:10.020\nor what Rock Hudson, when I was a kid, it was like AIDS was being invented.\n\n38:10.020 --> 38:12.020\nAnd then there were all these Rock Hudson died\n\n38:12.020 --> 38:15.020\nand there were all these weird jokes about, you know,\n\n38:15.020 --> 38:20.020\nwalking in AIDS and, you know, it was like cooties became a real fun thing\n\n38:20.020 --> 38:22.020\nand insensitivity ran rampant.\n\n38:22.020 --> 38:24.020\nAnd then the space shuttle Challenger, when I was 12, blew up.\n\n38:24.020 --> 38:26.020\nAnd I'm just like, what does NASA stand for?\n\n38:26.020 --> 38:30.020\nA variety of hilarious things that all have to do with not appreciating the fact\n\n38:30.020 --> 38:32.020\nthat seven people blew up.\n\n38:32.020 --> 38:37.020\nBut the interesting thing about that is that it all,\n\n38:37.020 --> 38:41.020\nknocking on wood, not walking under a ladder,\n\n38:41.020 --> 38:46.020\ncats crossing your path, it's superstition and religion and benevolence\n\n38:46.020 --> 38:52.020\nand hatred, cruelty, politics, YouTube comment sections.\n\n38:52.020 --> 38:58.020\nHumanity, unlike cheetahs and giraffes and eel and mosquitoes,\n\n38:58.020 --> 39:03.020\nwe reach these tendrils out into a completely chaotic universe\n\n39:03.020 --> 39:08.020\nthat for all intents and purposes, for every signal that it sends to us,\n\n39:08.020 --> 39:10.020\ndoesn't give a fuck what happens.\n\n39:10.020 --> 39:13.020\nYou can't control when it rains.\n\n39:13.020 --> 39:15.020\nYou don't know who's going to get cancer.\n\n39:15.020 --> 39:20.020\nYou don't know why Ugg dropped dead and Blug Blug didn't.\n\n39:20.020 --> 39:25.020\nBut we insist upon reaching out into the world\n\n39:25.020 --> 39:29.020\nand I don't think we characterize it by going like,\n\n39:29.020 --> 39:31.020\noh, we're afraid of everything we don't understand\n\n39:31.020 --> 39:33.020\nso we try to make sense of it.\n\n39:33.020 --> 39:38.020\nOkay, granted, but the flip side of that coin trying to make sense of the unknown\n\n39:38.020 --> 39:41.020\nis a lot easier to hide from the unknown.\n\n39:41.020 --> 39:44.020\nI'm not saying it's a bad thing.\n\n39:44.020 --> 39:46.020\nNo, I'm not correcting you on anything.\n\n39:46.020 --> 39:47.020\nI'm not arguing.\n\n39:47.020 --> 39:49.020\nI'm just like, this is amazing.\n\n39:49.020 --> 39:57.020\nWhen a little kid makes a joke about the space shuttle blowing up,\n\n39:57.020 --> 39:59.020\nthat little kid doesn't know it,\n\n39:59.020 --> 40:03.020\nbut his unconscious brain is reaching out into the world\n\n40:03.020 --> 40:07.020\nand claiming responsibility for seven people blowing up in a space shuttle.\n\n40:07.020 --> 40:13.020\nThat little child is apotheosizing, if that's a word.\n\n40:13.020 --> 40:15.020\nHe's becoming God.\n\n40:15.020 --> 40:17.020\nHe's going like, well, this thing happened\n\n40:17.020 --> 40:19.020\nand here's what I got to say about it.\n\n40:19.020 --> 40:21.020\nDoodoo's and butt butts.\n\n40:21.020 --> 40:27.020\nWe are, we are, and so talk about your experience on Twitter today.\n\n40:27.020 --> 40:34.020\nOh, it was just weird because I, so I was driving back from Big Sur today\n\n40:34.020 --> 40:37.020\nand I don't know.\n\n40:37.020 --> 40:38.020\nWhat a life.\n\n40:38.020 --> 40:40.020\nYeah, geez, it's rough.\n\n40:40.020 --> 40:43.020\nI was driving back and just sort of like,\n\n40:43.020 --> 40:45.020\nyou were flying back on a private jet,\n\n40:45.020 --> 40:47.020\nyou were driving back like any old asshole.\n\n40:47.020 --> 40:49.020\nYeah, but he's probably like...\n\n40:49.020 --> 40:51.020\nHe's kind of gone to little sir.\n\n40:51.020 --> 40:52.020\nHe knows what he's doing.\n\n40:52.020 --> 40:56.020\nI just wanted to drop that I can afford some of the hotels in Big Sur right now.\n\n40:56.020 --> 40:57.020\nAnd guests.\n\n40:57.020 --> 40:59.020\nWell, but it...\n\n40:59.020 --> 41:01.020\nEven the trees are bigger out there.\n\n41:01.020 --> 41:03.020\nEverything's awesome.\n\n41:03.020 --> 41:04.020\nIt's like heaven on earth.\n\n41:04.020 --> 41:06.020\nSo I'm driving back.\n\n41:06.020 --> 41:08.020\nIt really wants me to...\n\n41:08.020 --> 41:09.020\nIt's a big story.\n\n41:09.020 --> 41:12.020\nLike the first thing I wanted to do is write a movie about a guy wanting to write a movie\n\n41:12.020 --> 41:14.020\nabout writing a write a movie.\n\n41:14.020 --> 41:16.020\nThis feels like every shitty meta.\n\n41:16.020 --> 41:18.020\nYeah, there's no perspective there.\n\n41:18.020 --> 41:20.020\nIt's all like we are clearly...\n\n41:20.020 --> 41:22.020\nAll I want to know is I want to be a writer.\n\n41:22.020 --> 41:23.020\nYeah.\n\n41:23.020 --> 41:25.020\nLook at all these trees and dirt.\n\n41:25.020 --> 41:27.020\nI think it ties in well to what you were saying is that part of,\n\n41:27.020 --> 41:30.020\nI think what we, because our brains are so smart,\n\n41:30.020 --> 41:33.020\nwe're trying, it's all about power and control.\n\n41:33.020 --> 41:36.020\nAnd control is predictability saying why thunder is happening,\n\n41:36.020 --> 41:38.020\nit's because Zeus is angry.\n\n41:38.020 --> 41:39.020\nWhy did certain things happen?\n\n41:39.020 --> 41:40.020\nBecause these other things happen.\n\n41:40.020 --> 41:41.020\nSo I was on Twitter.\n\n41:41.020 --> 41:43.020\nI didn't have access to like radio.\n\n41:43.020 --> 41:46.020\nSo the only thing I had was like just refreshing Twitter over and over and see.\n\n41:46.020 --> 41:49.020\nAnd like you would see like something small would get reported\n\n41:49.020 --> 41:51.020\nand then someone would hear it.\n\n41:51.020 --> 41:54.020\nAnd then because it's hundreds of people on Twitter repeating it,\n\n41:54.020 --> 41:55.020\nit would become the truth.\n\n41:55.020 --> 41:59.020\nSo at some point it was that some Saudi national was the guy.\n\n41:59.020 --> 42:02.020\nAnd so then that became the truth for like a half hour.\n\n42:02.020 --> 42:04.020\nI was like, fuck my people are at it again, you know.\n\n42:04.020 --> 42:06.020\nAnd that became the truth.\n\n42:06.020 --> 42:08.020\nBut it's also, that's also part of people being like,\n\n42:08.020 --> 42:10.020\nit would, I think most people are like,\n\n42:10.020 --> 42:14.020\nit would make most sense if it is al-Qaeda.\n\n42:14.020 --> 42:16.020\nThen it's a threat we already have.\n\n42:16.020 --> 42:18.020\nWe know what that is.\n\n42:18.020 --> 42:20.020\nIt sucks, but that's what that is.\n\n42:20.020 --> 42:23.020\nSo people, there was like a sense of relief almost.\n\n42:23.020 --> 42:25.020\nPeople were like tweeting that because I said,\n\n42:25.020 --> 42:26.020\nI hope it's a white guy.\n\n42:26.020 --> 42:29.020\nJust because I think that's inherently not politicized.\n\n42:29.020 --> 42:32.020\nAnd people would respond to me like sort of like,\n\n42:32.020 --> 42:35.020\nlike bragging that like, look, it's one of your people.\n\n42:35.020 --> 42:37.020\nLike I got a ton of people.\n\n42:37.020 --> 42:39.020\nWhat do you mean?\n\n42:39.020 --> 42:41.020\nI said, I hope it's a crazy white guy.\n\n42:41.020 --> 42:43.020\nMost people understood what I said.\n\n42:43.020 --> 42:47.020\nAnd so you entered into an unspoken almost like,\n\n42:47.020 --> 42:49.020\nlike if you're watching The Bachelor with somebody and going like,\n\n42:49.020 --> 42:52.020\nI hope he gives the flower to Cynthia and sort of Veronica.\n\n42:52.020 --> 42:54.020\nThere's just like an automatic kind of, I told you.\n\n42:54.020 --> 42:57.020\nYeah. A lot of people are like, well, sorry to burst your bubble.\n\n42:57.020 --> 43:00.020\nI swear someone said that and then linked me.\n\n43:00.020 --> 43:03.020\nI'm like, are you, is there a glee that it's,\n\n43:03.020 --> 43:05.020\ndo you think it's like a guy from the Middle East?\n\n43:05.020 --> 43:08.020\nAnd I think there really is a little bit because that's a known threat.\n\n43:08.020 --> 43:11.020\nAnd that's a way to compartmentalize and control the situation\n\n43:11.020 --> 43:13.020\nor at least have some power over it is no like,\n\n43:13.020 --> 43:15.020\nOh, we know these are the bad guys.\n\n43:15.020 --> 43:18.020\nIt's Dr. Doom again. You know, that's why like people,\n\n43:18.020 --> 43:21.020\neven in movies, like superhero movies,\n\n43:21.020 --> 43:23.020\npeople like when it's like Riddler or whatever,\n\n43:23.020 --> 43:25.020\nthey don't like like, who's the fuck is this new guy?\n\n43:25.020 --> 43:29.020\nI want it to be a new Dr. Doom because I don't want,\n\n43:29.020 --> 43:32.020\nI don't want to live in a world where, I mean,\n\n43:32.020 --> 43:35.020\nas I was, we're speaking about the cartoon parts of our brains\n\n43:35.020 --> 43:36.020\nthat are thinking these things.\n\n43:36.020 --> 43:38.020\nFirst of all, why do we think we know things?\n\n43:38.020 --> 43:40.020\nSecond of all, why do we want certain things over other things?\n\n43:40.020 --> 43:41.020\nThat's what's interesting to me.\n\n43:41.020 --> 43:44.020\nGiven no, none of us are in forensics.\n\n43:44.020 --> 43:46.020\nNone of us are in politics.\n\n43:46.020 --> 43:49.020\nNone of us are like, but we all have opinions.\n\n43:49.020 --> 43:51.020\nWe all have theories.\n\n43:51.020 --> 43:53.020\nAnd as I was saying,\n\n43:53.020 --> 43:57.020\nI'm like a weird guinea pig in this experiment\n\n43:57.020 --> 44:00.020\nbecause I knew nothing was exposed to nothing.\n\n44:00.020 --> 44:02.020\nWell, what's interesting in nothing?\n\n44:02.020 --> 44:05.020\nAnd immediately had opinions and leads\n\n44:05.020 --> 44:07.020\nand where you can start your investigation.\n\n44:07.020 --> 44:10.020\nThe Joker usually leaves a clue at the scene.\n\n44:10.020 --> 44:12.020\nThere were no cards found.\n\n44:12.020 --> 44:14.020\nSo it wasn't him, but it's true.\n\n44:14.020 --> 44:16.020\nAnd my girlfriend called me on it and said like,\n\n44:16.020 --> 44:20.020\nbecause it would be weird if Al-Qaeda loved,\n\n44:20.020 --> 44:24.020\nlike was so into something as specific as a Boston Marathon.\n\n44:24.020 --> 44:26.020\nAnd I was like, yeah, yeah, I guess.\n\n44:26.020 --> 44:29.020\nWhat am I, like an Al-Qaeda expert?\n\n44:29.020 --> 44:30.020\nA manhunter?\n\n44:30.020 --> 44:32.020\nI'm in the mind of my enemy.\n\n44:32.020 --> 44:36.020\nTwo things, one, it doesn't seem like their style,\n\n44:36.020 --> 44:37.020\nwhatever that is.\n\n44:37.020 --> 44:38.020\nTwo.\n\n44:38.020 --> 44:39.020\nWho does it mean?\n\n44:39.020 --> 44:43.020\nTheir style is airplanes going into a building that no longer exists.\n\n44:43.020 --> 44:46.020\nThe scope is a little smaller unless it's got fucked up.\n\n44:46.020 --> 44:48.020\nI mean, I think it was supposed to be a bigger event than it was.\n\n44:48.020 --> 44:52.020\nWell, that's why it sucks if it's one guy who just happens to Middle Eastern\n\n44:52.020 --> 44:54.020\nwho's like, I'm just going to do this one thing on mine.\n\n44:54.020 --> 44:56.020\nBut the thing what you were saying, I want to say this real quick,\n\n44:56.020 --> 45:00.020\nwhat you knew just from the four senses is what all of us know.\n\n45:00.020 --> 45:02.020\nBut if you're following the news cycle,\n\n45:02.020 --> 45:06.020\nyou just like, things happen and they become truth and then it's false\n\n45:06.020 --> 45:07.020\nand then it's truth and then it's false.\n\n45:07.020 --> 45:09.020\nBut all the things you said, which is like three people die,\n\n45:09.020 --> 45:11.020\nthere's how many people are injured, there's where it happened,\n\n45:11.020 --> 45:13.020\nthat is all we know still.\n\n45:13.020 --> 45:14.020\nThat is all we know.\n\n45:14.020 --> 45:15.020\nSo you don't know anything.\n\n45:15.020 --> 45:17.020\nHere's a really weird question.\n\n45:17.020 --> 45:22.020\nWhat's more racist?\n\n45:22.020 --> 45:24.020\nThis or that?\n\n45:24.020 --> 45:29.020\nThe whole audience is going to lean in imperceptibly.\n\n45:29.020 --> 45:34.020\nIs it more, are you more racist and jingoistic or whatever phrase you want to use?\n\n45:34.020 --> 45:37.020\nThis is a half-year grade, you guys.\n\n45:37.020 --> 45:43.020\nIf you hope it was a Middle Easterner, let's say,\n\n45:43.020 --> 45:48.020\nI'm not even going to say Al-Qaeda, let's say,\n\n45:48.020 --> 45:53.020\nor if you hope it was, as you say, a crazy white guy,\n\n45:53.020 --> 46:01.020\nas a liberal white 40-year-old guy sitting in my house in Los Angeles,\n\n46:01.020 --> 46:06.020\nmy immediate hope, and this is all instinctive and I'm being honest about it,\n\n46:06.020 --> 46:11.020\nI didn't have time to connect any of these dots consciously.\n\n46:11.020 --> 46:15.020\nThis is what happened in my brain chemistry when I heard the news.\n\n46:15.020 --> 46:20.020\nI hope and hope that it is a crazy white guy\n\n46:20.020 --> 46:23.020\nand I haven't asked myself yet why I hope that.\n\n46:23.020 --> 46:25.020\nPart of it is self-preservation.\n\n46:25.020 --> 46:30.020\nI want to have a kid with Aaron and I don't want my kid to grow up in a...\n\n46:30.020 --> 46:34.020\nThat's your feet to kick time traveling back.\n\n46:34.020 --> 46:36.020\nHe's like, please do it!\n\n46:36.020 --> 46:38.020\nAaron made it after all.\n\n46:38.020 --> 46:41.020\nYeah, he's saying the penicillin worked so well.\n\n46:41.020 --> 46:43.020\nAdam Goldberg applauded because he wants to have a kid\n\n46:43.020 --> 46:48.020\nthat will come over to that kid's playground uninvited and swing next to him.\n\n46:48.020 --> 46:51.020\nAnd do puns based on the newest tragedy.\n\n46:51.020 --> 46:53.020\nI know where all the good water fountains are.\n\n46:53.020 --> 46:57.020\nThe thing is, my uncle had spina bifida and he doesn't tend to go there,\n\n46:57.020 --> 47:00.020\nbut pipes is pipes, I don't know.\n\n47:00.020 --> 47:03.020\nI think a crazy white guy is better.\n\n47:03.020 --> 47:06.020\nWell, a crazy white guy is clean and simple.\n\n47:06.020 --> 47:08.020\nAnd it makes everything feel like a David Fincher film.\n\n47:08.020 --> 47:09.020\nIt's just one guy.\n\n47:09.020 --> 47:12.020\nAs opposed to a conspiracy or an ideology.\n\n47:12.020 --> 47:14.020\nAdam, Adam, don't blow us up.\n\n47:14.020 --> 47:16.020\nDon't blow us up, please.\n\n47:20.020 --> 47:22.020\nBut am I...\n\n47:24.020 --> 47:28.020\nAren't I, on a deeper Noam Chomsky level,\n\n47:28.020 --> 47:33.020\nmore racist and more part of the evil\n\n47:33.020 --> 47:38.020\nto hope that it wasn't the Visigoths\n\n47:38.020 --> 47:41.020\nthat spit on the wall of Rome?\n\n47:41.020 --> 47:42.020\nWhy do you say that?\n\n47:42.020 --> 47:45.020\nBecause I want to think that they're gone.\n\n47:45.020 --> 47:47.020\nBecause I don't want them in the picture.\n\n47:47.020 --> 47:49.020\nDoesn't that make me...\n\n47:49.020 --> 47:51.020\nI want to think.\n\n47:51.020 --> 47:55.020\nI don't want to raise my child, my beautiful rich white child,\n\n47:55.020 --> 47:59.020\nin a world where the Legion of Doom is still operative.\n\n47:59.020 --> 48:01.020\nWell, I think this is what it is.\n\n48:01.020 --> 48:04.020\nI think you know the Legion of Doom is still operative, right?\n\n48:04.020 --> 48:06.020\nYou know there's always going to be...\n\n48:06.020 --> 48:10.020\nwhen you're the most prosperous country in the world.\n\n48:10.020 --> 48:13.020\nI think we all know a lot of stuff that we don't consciously deal with.\n\n48:13.020 --> 48:14.020\nSure, sure.\n\n48:14.020 --> 48:16.020\nBut I think what would be good, from my perspective,\n\n48:16.020 --> 48:17.020\nI'll tell you why.\n\n48:17.020 --> 48:18.020\nI don't know what your perspective is.\n\n48:18.020 --> 48:20.020\nMy perspective, it's good if it's not a white guy,\n\n48:20.020 --> 48:23.020\nis because I remember right after 9-11 happened\n\n48:23.020 --> 48:25.020\nand like the shit that people would say to me on the street.\n\n48:25.020 --> 48:27.020\nIt's a very, you know, you think about yourself,\n\n48:27.020 --> 48:28.020\nyou personalize it.\n\n48:28.020 --> 48:30.020\nI don't want that stuff happening to me again.\n\n48:30.020 --> 48:31.020\nI don't want that shit happening to me.\n\n48:31.020 --> 48:34.020\nAnd also, if it's a white guy, it's just one white guy.\n\n48:34.020 --> 48:38.020\nIf it's a brown guy, it's all the brown people are somehow accountable.\n\n48:38.020 --> 48:40.020\nThat's just how it happens.\n\n48:40.020 --> 48:42.020\nThat's how I see it happening on Twitter.\n\n48:42.020 --> 48:43.020\nThat's just how it happens.\n\n48:43.020 --> 48:44.020\nI would see the looks.\n\n48:44.020 --> 48:45.020\nIt's interesting.\n\n48:45.020 --> 48:47.020\nLike, I live in LA, I go to New York,\n\n48:47.020 --> 48:50.020\nbut when I go to Ohio, I get looks.\n\n48:50.020 --> 48:51.020\nI swear.\n\n48:51.020 --> 48:53.020\nI was like, why is that guy looking at me?\n\n48:53.020 --> 48:54.020\nI'm like, oh, right.\n\n48:54.020 --> 48:56.020\nThis was a look I was used to 10 years ago,\n\n48:56.020 --> 48:58.020\nbut since I've moved to New York or LA,\n\n48:58.020 --> 49:00.020\nI don't get that look anymore.\n\n49:00.020 --> 49:02.020\nI wonder if it'll ever be a woman.\n\n49:02.020 --> 49:04.020\nWe're just saying guy, brown guy, white guy,\n\n49:04.020 --> 49:05.020\nthis guy, that guy.\n\n49:05.020 --> 49:07.020\nIt's never a woman.\n\n49:07.020 --> 49:10.020\nA lot of suicide bombers are women,\n\n49:10.020 --> 49:12.020\nbecause they don't pat them down.\n\n49:12.020 --> 49:13.020\nThis is true.\n\n49:13.020 --> 49:14.020\nI don't know why.\n\n49:14.020 --> 49:15.020\nI have a smile.\n\n49:15.020 --> 49:18.020\nIt's just the only reach up to the resistance.\n\n49:18.020 --> 49:19.020\nThe what?\n\n49:19.020 --> 49:23.020\nErin said that's only to find the vagina at TSA checkpoints,\n\n49:23.020 --> 49:26.020\nbecause she always opts out when they tell her,\n\n49:26.020 --> 49:28.020\nI'm going to reach up to the resistance.\n\n49:28.020 --> 49:30.020\nThat's what they say?\n\n49:30.020 --> 49:32.020\nWhen they push the resistance, I'm like,\n\n49:32.020 --> 49:36.020\nyou're telling me, sister.\n\n49:36.020 --> 49:43.020\nViva la resistanz.\n\n49:43.020 --> 49:44.020\nI don't know.\n\n49:44.020 --> 49:45.020\nIt's interesting.\n\n49:45.020 --> 49:47.020\nI had a thought in my head,\n\n49:47.020 --> 49:51.020\nno, I have none of your motivations.\n\n49:51.020 --> 49:53.020\nYour subjective motivations.\n\n49:53.020 --> 49:55.020\nYeah, which are very subjective.\n\n49:55.020 --> 49:58.020\nBut I'm not saying they're noble at all.\n\n49:58.020 --> 49:59.020\nThey're not noble.\n\n49:59.020 --> 50:00.020\nNo, of course.\n\n50:00.020 --> 50:03.020\nNoble or not.\n\n50:03.020 --> 50:05.020\nYeah, because I could say,\n\n50:05.020 --> 50:07.020\nwell, if it's a guy that lived on Franklin,\n\n50:07.020 --> 50:08.020\nthey'll close off Franklin.\n\n50:08.020 --> 50:10.020\nI won't be able to get to my haircut appointment.\n\n50:10.020 --> 50:14.020\nYeah, there's subjective reasons.\n\n50:14.020 --> 50:18.020\nAnd you have a very subjective reason\n\n50:18.020 --> 50:20.020\nthat I don't have that you pointed out.\n\n50:20.020 --> 50:22.020\nAnd beyond that though,\n\n50:22.020 --> 50:25.020\nI want to know in my white brain,\n\n50:25.020 --> 50:27.020\nwhy do I want it to be a white guy?\n\n50:27.020 --> 50:29.020\nAnd I don't think it's because I'm a hero.\n\n50:29.020 --> 50:32.020\nI think it's less of a threat if it's a white guy.\n\n50:32.020 --> 50:34.020\nYeah, it just feels more like a comic book.\n\n50:34.020 --> 50:36.020\nIt feels like a Batman movie.\n\n50:36.020 --> 50:38.020\nIt's like, oh, who's this guy?\n\n50:38.020 --> 50:41.020\nPeople are just strapping themselves up with a bunch of shit.\n\n50:41.020 --> 50:43.020\nEveryone knows how to make a bomb.\n\n50:43.020 --> 50:46.020\nWe've covered how to turn a cell phone into a weapon.\n\n50:46.020 --> 50:48.020\nEverybody knows how to do it.\n\n50:48.020 --> 50:50.020\nAnybody who's had a bad week,\n\n50:50.020 --> 50:53.020\na giant cocksucker and blew up a bunch of people,\n\n50:53.020 --> 50:57.020\nthat to me is worse than some dedicated foe that we hate.\n\n50:57.020 --> 50:58.020\nIt was the penguin.\n\n50:58.020 --> 51:00.020\nAnd we know that we're after this organization.\n\n51:00.020 --> 51:02.020\nWe can't get him, but we're trying our heart.\n\n51:02.020 --> 51:03.020\nThat's one thing.\n\n51:03.020 --> 51:06.020\nBut if it's just every disenfranchised lunatic out there\n\n51:06.020 --> 51:08.020\nthat wants to go make a point,\n\n51:08.020 --> 51:11.020\nthat's what's freaky because there's something about the fact\n\n51:11.020 --> 51:15.020\nthat appears to be a couple low-level trashcan bombs\n\n51:15.020 --> 51:19.020\nthat blew up 150 people or whatever.\n\n51:19.020 --> 51:21.020\nThat's kind of low scope.\n\n51:21.020 --> 51:24.020\nYou could go a lot bigger than that with just by being an asshole.\n\n51:24.020 --> 51:27.020\nAnd now we're going to, like you said earlier, Dan,\n\n51:27.020 --> 51:32.020\nit's not just the politics that go into why someone does shit like that.\n\n51:32.020 --> 51:36.020\nIt's how that shapes the world we live in after this now.\n\n51:36.020 --> 51:38.020\nAnd everything gets a little bit funkier,\n\n51:38.020 --> 51:40.020\na little bit more security cameras, a little bit more.\n\n51:40.020 --> 51:42.020\nNow we're all watching each other.\n\n51:42.020 --> 51:44.020\nAnd somebody very weirdly, but astutely pointed out today,\n\n51:44.020 --> 51:46.020\nlike, look, there's cameras everywhere.\n\n51:46.020 --> 51:48.020\nIt's a finish line to race.\n\n51:48.020 --> 51:49.020\nEveryone's got their phones out.\n\n51:49.020 --> 51:51.020\nThey're going to be going through all that shit.\n\n51:51.020 --> 51:53.020\nAnd if they're going to be looking for people of different ethnicity\n\n51:53.020 --> 51:55.020\ncarrying backpacks, that's everybody there.\n\n51:55.020 --> 51:57.020\nBecause lots of people from all over the world\n\n51:57.020 --> 51:59.020\nhave their best friend waiting at the finish line\n\n51:59.020 --> 52:02.020\nto give them a fucking power bar and some Gatorade and some shit.\n\n52:02.020 --> 52:04.020\nWell, I thought what you were going to say is\n\n52:04.020 --> 52:06.020\nif they're going to be looking for people of different ethnicity\n\n52:06.020 --> 52:09.020\ncarrying backpacks, they're going to be able to focus on those people\n\n52:09.020 --> 52:12.020\nmore easily than people who blended in that were wearing backpacks.\n\n52:12.020 --> 52:14.020\nBut the line-up's going to be long\n\n52:14.020 --> 52:16.020\nbecause it's a bunch of people holding knapsacks out there\n\n52:16.020 --> 52:17.020\nand stuff like that.\n\n52:17.020 --> 52:19.020\nThe other thing I want to say is that I don't want this to be\n\n52:19.020 --> 52:20.020\na political statement at all.\n\n52:20.020 --> 52:21.020\nI really don't.\n\n52:21.020 --> 52:23.020\nAnd I said this on Twitter and I got a lot of shit for it.\n\n52:23.020 --> 52:26.020\nHere's also, and honestly, I'm not trying to downplay anything.\n\n52:26.020 --> 52:28.020\nFuck Mexicans.\n\n52:29.020 --> 52:30.020\nNo, no, no.\n\n52:30.020 --> 52:31.020\nYou deleted that one, right?\n\n52:31.020 --> 52:32.020\nNo, I did.\n\n52:32.020 --> 52:35.020\nBut honestly, kind of fuck Mexicans.\n\n52:35.020 --> 52:37.020\nLike, what's a gordita?\n\n52:37.020 --> 52:38.020\nI don't get it.\n\n52:38.020 --> 52:39.020\nLike, yeah.\n\n52:39.020 --> 52:40.020\nHow soft do your tacos have to get?\n\n52:40.020 --> 52:41.020\nYeah, yeah.\n\n52:41.020 --> 52:42.020\nChoco taco?\n\n52:42.020 --> 52:43.020\nThe ice cream taco?\n\n52:43.020 --> 52:44.020\nThe point is to eat the crispiness.\n\n52:44.020 --> 52:45.020\nYeah.\n\n52:45.020 --> 52:46.020\nGet your shit together.\n\n52:46.020 --> 52:48.020\nChoco is just a cone in a different shape.\n\n52:48.020 --> 52:50.020\nWe're all onto you.\n\n52:50.020 --> 52:52.020\nDon't make us give Texas back.\n\n52:52.020 --> 52:54.020\nGive us some tater tots or something.\n\n52:54.020 --> 52:55.020\nYou know what I mean?\n\n52:55.020 --> 52:57.020\nIf it turns out to be a Mexican terrorist that did this,\n\n52:57.020 --> 53:00.020\nhow does that affect the brown people's standpoint of yours?\n\n53:00.020 --> 53:02.020\nOh, we're cool.\n\n53:02.020 --> 53:03.020\nWe're, like, good.\n\n53:03.020 --> 53:06.020\nThey're because of an eye shape and eyebrows and the last name.\n\n53:06.020 --> 53:07.020\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n53:07.020 --> 53:08.020\nLook how...\n\n53:08.020 --> 53:10.020\nI was going to say something horribly raising.\n\n53:10.020 --> 53:11.020\nDo it.\n\n53:11.020 --> 53:12.020\nNo, no, no.\n\n53:12.020 --> 53:15.020\nNo one's going to tell anybody.\n\n53:15.020 --> 53:17.020\nAnybody can hear this.\n\n53:17.020 --> 53:21.020\nHere's the one thing I want to say is that I grew up in Pakistan\n\n53:21.020 --> 53:23.020\nand the one thing Americans don't have that we had,\n\n53:23.020 --> 53:25.020\nthat Americans have that we didn't have,\n\n53:25.020 --> 53:28.020\nAmericans have this assumed sense of security,\n\n53:28.020 --> 53:30.020\nwhich is a huge privilege and it's a luxury\n\n53:30.020 --> 53:33.020\nand most of the people in the world do not have that.\n\n53:33.020 --> 53:34.020\nI know I didn't have it.\n\n53:34.020 --> 53:38.020\nAnd just, there were, like, bombs in Iraq today\n\n53:38.020 --> 53:40.020\nand 42 people died.\n\n53:40.020 --> 53:42.020\nAnd I'm not saying you make the strategy smaller,\n\n53:42.020 --> 53:45.020\nbut any time you read about a bomb happening\n\n53:45.020 --> 53:47.020\nin another part of the world,\n\n53:47.020 --> 53:50.020\ntry and remember how it felt here to have that happen to,\n\n53:50.020 --> 53:52.020\nwith three people dying in Boston,\n\n53:52.020 --> 53:55.020\nand how that must feel for the people over there.\n\n53:55.020 --> 53:57.020\nI think that's a very important...\n\n53:57.020 --> 53:59.020\nPeople, yeah.\n\n54:01.020 --> 54:03.020\nDoesn't it feel weird when you get applause\n\n54:03.020 --> 54:05.020\nand then you feel like, I didn't do that for applause.\n\n54:05.020 --> 54:08.020\nI think when people, you read about bombs all the time,\n\n54:08.020 --> 54:11.020\nbombs in Syria, and it always, like, just goes off of you.\n\n54:11.020 --> 54:13.020\nYou think it's just, like, some other world that's happening.\n\n54:13.020 --> 54:14.020\nBut that's the world.\n\n54:14.020 --> 54:16.020\nPeople are living their lives there\n\n54:16.020 --> 54:18.020\nand they love their kids and they like the food\n\n54:18.020 --> 54:20.020\nand they have, you know, favorite ice cream flavors or whatever.\n\n54:20.020 --> 54:23.020\nSo just remember how awful this is\n\n54:23.020 --> 54:26.020\nand even now how distant you are from it\n\n54:26.020 --> 54:28.020\nand how it happens to people all over the world.\n\n54:28.020 --> 54:31.020\nAnd it's like a more of a fact of life for a lot of people.\n\n54:31.020 --> 54:32.020\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n54:32.020 --> 54:36.020\nI mean, that's, like, yeah, that is the, like, the...\n\n54:36.020 --> 54:38.020\nThe fucked up thing is that when you're...\n\n54:38.020 --> 54:41.020\nWhen you're a fat, rich, white, 40-year-old,\n\n54:41.020 --> 54:43.020\nvideo game-loving, wheat-thin eatin',\n\n54:43.020 --> 54:45.020\nlike, community-createin',\n\n54:45.020 --> 54:47.020\nif I could drinkin', community-createin',\n\n54:47.020 --> 54:51.020\nhangin' out, doin' your showin', guyin',\n\n54:51.020 --> 54:54.020\nlike, the only time these conversations happen\n\n54:54.020 --> 54:55.020\nis when this stuff happens.\n\n54:55.020 --> 54:57.020\nAnd it's when this stuff happens that you think\n\n54:57.020 --> 54:59.020\nthat exact thought that I do, that I go,\n\n54:59.020 --> 55:03.020\noh, I wonder how many people, like, you know,\n\n55:03.020 --> 55:05.020\nI wonder what's going on on the planet\n\n55:05.020 --> 55:08.020\nand why this is a bigger deal.\n\n55:08.020 --> 55:11.020\nAnd if I chime in with that sentiment at that point,\n\n55:11.020 --> 55:13.020\nI couldn't be a bigger hypocrite because it's like,\n\n55:13.020 --> 55:17.020\nI had my chance to give a fuck about whether people lived or died\n\n55:17.020 --> 55:18.020\nand I didn't.\n\n55:18.020 --> 55:21.020\nSo then, did Noam Chomsky chime in when it happens?\n\n55:21.020 --> 55:23.020\nIt's like, you're the worst of both worlds\n\n55:23.020 --> 55:28.020\nbecause you're eating Twinkies while everyone's dyin'\n\n55:28.020 --> 55:32.020\nand then schoolchildren get shot and the thing\n\n55:32.020 --> 55:36.020\nand then if I choose to go, well, compared to what happens.\n\n55:36.020 --> 55:37.020\nWell, I mean, it's not compared to,\n\n55:37.020 --> 55:39.020\nit's not trying to downplay anything.\n\n55:39.020 --> 55:41.020\nIt's just saying people who are very rotted\n\n55:41.020 --> 55:42.020\nand feeling a lot of things.\n\n55:42.020 --> 55:44.020\nAnd if I say this two days from now,\n\n55:44.020 --> 55:46.020\npeople aren't gonna be feeling that anymore.\n\n55:46.020 --> 55:48.020\nThe bubble of security will be back.\n\n55:48.020 --> 55:51.020\nIf you say that today, like, what you feel right now,\n\n55:51.020 --> 55:54.020\nhow raw and hurt and painful it feels,\n\n55:54.020 --> 55:57.020\nthat's like a real feeling for a lot of people in the world\n\n55:57.020 --> 55:58.020\nall the time.\n\n55:58.020 --> 55:59.020\nAnd that's not to downplay anything.\n\n55:59.020 --> 56:02.020\nIt's just because someone died somewhere else\n\n56:02.020 --> 56:05.020\nand those are bomb, doesn't mean you can't enjoy your video games.\n\n56:05.020 --> 56:07.020\nIt just means, you know, just be aware.\n\n56:07.020 --> 56:10.020\nIt's a big world and, you know...\n\n56:10.020 --> 56:13.020\nYeah, well, I do think, yeah, we've entered a world where we...\n\n56:13.020 --> 56:17.020\nI'll tell you, it's gonna be a tough segue into D&D after this.\n\n56:17.020 --> 56:19.020\nBut a welcome one.\n\n56:19.020 --> 56:20.020\nI don't think so at all.\n\n56:20.020 --> 56:23.020\nI think if you listen to last week's recording,\n\n56:23.020 --> 56:25.020\nyou're like, well, there's an example of nothing going wrong\n\n56:25.020 --> 56:27.020\nin the world and nothing being sensitive\n\n56:27.020 --> 56:29.020\nand it's just a shit piece of shit show.\n\n56:29.020 --> 56:31.020\nI thought the show was good.\n\n56:31.020 --> 56:32.020\nDid you think the show was bad?\n\n56:32.020 --> 56:33.020\nI blame myself.\n\n56:33.020 --> 56:35.020\nThis is a boring turd laying inside.\n\n56:35.020 --> 56:36.020\nWas it boring?\n\n56:36.020 --> 56:37.020\nYeah, I think so.\n\n56:37.020 --> 56:38.020\nYou forgot a belt.\n\n56:38.020 --> 56:39.020\nNope.\n\n56:39.020 --> 56:40.020\nIt's because I forgot a belt.\n\n56:40.020 --> 56:42.020\nOr it's because the microphone didn't work\n\n56:42.020 --> 56:43.020\nwhen I stepped out.\n\n56:43.020 --> 56:44.020\nI don't know what it is.\n\n56:44.020 --> 56:45.020\nI listened to it when I edited it.\n\n56:45.020 --> 56:48.020\nAgain, you're trying to find, like, a reason for something happening.\n\n56:48.020 --> 56:50.020\nYou're trying to put structure on it.\n\n56:50.020 --> 56:53.020\nAnyway, but no, but what I'm saying is, no,\n\n56:53.020 --> 56:55.020\nI like what I like about Harmontown is that\n\n56:55.020 --> 56:58.020\nthere's absolutely nothing about something horrible happening\n\n56:58.020 --> 57:02.020\nthat precludes the possibility of people being smart and fun\n\n57:02.020 --> 57:03.020\nand...\n\n57:03.020 --> 57:04.020\nAnd playing D&D.\n\n57:04.020 --> 57:05.020\n...touching each other.\n\n57:05.020 --> 57:06.020\nThat's awesome.\n\n57:06.020 --> 57:08.020\nNo matter how bad things are,\n\n57:08.020 --> 57:10.020\nD&D will always happen on Harmontown.\n\n57:10.020 --> 57:14.020\nBut yeah, something sticks in my head about what you were saying.\n\n57:14.020 --> 57:15.020\nThat's a duet on the point.\n\n57:15.020 --> 57:17.020\nI think you put it succinctly.\n\n57:17.020 --> 57:25.020\nCreature born in 73 and being raised throughout the 80s.\n\n57:25.020 --> 57:27.020\nAnd we've entered this world now.\n\n57:27.020 --> 57:28.020\nIt's a globalized world.\n\n57:28.020 --> 57:34.020\nAnd we're just so conditioned now.\n\n57:34.020 --> 57:35.020\nThe news...\n\n57:35.020 --> 57:37.020\nNow we don't even watch the news.\n\n57:37.020 --> 57:41.020\nNow it's just we get all the information through this kind of trickle charge.\n\n57:41.020 --> 57:45.020\nBut it's still a child of Tom Brokaw.\n\n57:45.020 --> 57:47.020\nIt's a child of CNN.\n\n57:47.020 --> 57:49.020\nIt's a child of all that old media.\n\n57:49.020 --> 57:52.020\nAnd it's kind of like, oh, did you hear the news today?\n\n57:52.020 --> 58:00.020\nThe news in America, it's like this proudly isolationist kind of like heritage where we go.\n\n58:00.020 --> 58:04.020\nSomehow before you even got the information and parsed it,\n\n58:04.020 --> 58:09.020\nyou're like, liberation fighters and bugle bugle bugle bugle.\n\n58:09.020 --> 58:12.020\nWe don't know that they're human beings.\n\n58:12.020 --> 58:14.020\nWe have no idea what the fuck is going on.\n\n58:14.020 --> 58:15.020\nMordor, yeah.\n\n58:15.020 --> 58:18.020\nAnd the one thing that's never going to happen.\n\n58:18.020 --> 58:21.020\nI mean, maybe somewhere, but never on CNN and never on Fox News,\n\n58:21.020 --> 58:24.020\nnever on the big news channels or outlets.\n\n58:24.020 --> 58:27.020\nNo one's going to say, like, the president can't come on the air and go,\n\n58:27.020 --> 58:29.020\nhey, whoever did this, call me up.\n\n58:29.020 --> 58:30.020\nLet's talk about it.\n\n58:30.020 --> 58:32.020\nLet's find out why you did this.\n\n58:32.020 --> 58:33.020\nLet's address the situation.\n\n58:33.020 --> 58:34.020\nLet's be adults.\n\n58:34.020 --> 58:35.020\nLike, we don't want...\n\n58:35.020 --> 58:36.020\nNo one can do that.\n\n58:36.020 --> 58:40.020\nWe have to come down like a ton of like douchebag bricks on everything now.\n\n58:40.020 --> 58:41.020\nIt has to be like, we're going to get them.\n\n58:41.020 --> 58:42.020\nBring them to justice.\n\n58:42.020 --> 58:44.020\nYeah, bring them to justice.\n\n58:44.020 --> 58:45.020\nI saw that a lot.\n\n58:45.020 --> 58:47.020\nLike, that is not a positive sentiment.\n\n58:47.020 --> 58:48.020\nNo, no.\n\n58:48.020 --> 58:50.020\nIt's just, it's hang them high with Clint Eastwood.\n\n58:50.020 --> 58:54.020\nAnd it's like, I know that people, like, when you're in pain,\n\n58:54.020 --> 58:55.020\neverybody wants shit to stop.\n\n58:55.020 --> 58:58.020\nBut it's just like, when everything goes into, yeah,\n\n58:58.020 --> 59:00.020\nour little bubble got burst from them.\n\n59:00.020 --> 59:01.020\nAnd everything has to change.\n\n59:01.020 --> 59:04.020\nThis giant shift has to happen where, like,\n\n59:04.020 --> 59:07.020\nthe Constitution's going to go get sodomized in an alleyway and...\n\n59:07.020 --> 59:08.020\nAnd guess what?\n\n59:08.020 --> 59:09.020\nAnd guess what?\n\n59:09.020 --> 59:11.020\nAs soon as that happens, no more bombs.\n\n59:11.020 --> 59:12.020\nJust fucking move.\n\n59:12.020 --> 59:14.020\nBut I really, it is true.\n\n59:14.020 --> 59:15.020\nAmerica isn't such a bubble.\n\n59:15.020 --> 59:17.020\nAnd it's a very unique situation.\n\n59:17.020 --> 59:20.020\nAnd these kinds of things, sort of like you said,\n\n59:20.020 --> 59:21.020\nput a little hole in the bubble.\n\n59:21.020 --> 59:25.020\nBut, you know, try and remember this, but the bubble will be back.\n\n59:25.020 --> 59:27.020\nAnd next week, we won't give a shit about this.\n\n59:27.020 --> 59:28.020\nAnd we'll be back.\n\n59:28.020 --> 59:29.020\nYeah, Robert Williams will be here.\n\n59:29.020 --> 59:32.020\nNo one will give a fuck.\n\n59:32.020 --> 59:33.020\nZartas?\n\n59:33.020 --> 59:35.020\nGlad you guys watched it.\n\n59:35.020 --> 59:37.020\nWell, let's get Spencer up, because he was there for you.\n\n59:37.020 --> 59:38.020\nYeah, Spencer, come on up.\n\n59:38.020 --> 59:39.020\nSpencer, everybody.\n\n59:39.020 --> 59:41.020\nI think my...\n\n59:41.020 --> 59:45.020\nOh, I see what this contraption is.\n\n59:45.020 --> 59:47.020\nIt's my fault this thing...\n\n59:47.020 --> 59:48.020\nIt's the worst.\n\n59:48.020 --> 59:50.020\nIt's fiddling with this thing.\n\n59:50.020 --> 59:55.020\nWell, Camille was making points.\n\n59:55.020 --> 59:58.020\nFiddling with the black iron staff.\n\n59:58.020 --> 01:00:02.020\nThe entertainer twirls his expert fingers.\n\n01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:04.020\nSpencer came out swinging.\n\n01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:10.020\nHow many of you have now seen Zartas?\n\n01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.020\nBy applause.\n\n01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.020\nWow.\n\n01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.020\nA good number of people.\n\n01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:17.020\nNow by Zarpause.\n\n01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.020\nThe piece is evil.\n\n01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.020\nYeah, the gun is good.\n\n01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.020\nThe piece is evil.\n\n01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.020\nThat movie's wild, man.\n\n01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.020\nI have to say, I've watched it.\n\n01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:26.020\nI think I've tried to watch that movie at least four times.\n\n01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.020\nLast night, got through it.\n\n01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.020\nDidn't fall asleep.\n\n01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.020\nMade it through Zartas.\n\n01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:35.020\nYeah, I mean, that movie starts strong and it trickles out.\n\n01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.020\nWhat's Zartas?\n\n01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.020\nWhat is Zartas?\n\n01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.020\nThat's a very good question.\n\n01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.020\nWe can start off by answering the simple question,\n\n01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.020\nwhat is Zartas?\n\n01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:45.020\nWell, there's a spoiler answer to that question.\n\n01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:48.020\nYou can play it to me because I've never seen it.\n\n01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.020\nThat doesn't matter.\n\n01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.020\nIf you haven't seen it, watch it.\n\n01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.020\nI mean, Zartas is an experience.\n\n01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.020\nIf you have seen it, what do we have to talk about?\n\n01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:01.020\nIt's like Vietnam.\n\n01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.020\nYou're just like, yeah, I saw action.\n\n01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.020\nI was in the shit.\n\n01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:13.020\nSean Connery, this is after he has been James Bond.\n\n01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:19.020\nAnd I guess he had a reputation for not saying no to a lot of stuff.\n\n01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:23.020\nBut I think everyone thought Zartas was going to be the real deal.\n\n01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.020\nI think they thought it was going to be a goodie, right?\n\n01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:28.020\nYeah, there's no reason why.\n\n01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:32.020\nI find that to be a very compelling movie for the first 30 minutes.\n\n01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:35.020\nI'm very, very interested.\n\n01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:40.020\nThere's a modern kind of cogent version of that movie\n\n01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.020\nthat I think is very important, truly,\n\n01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.020\nbecause characters like Gilgamesh in ancient stories,\n\n01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:52.020\nthey're just mortals who proceed into the realm of immortality\n\n01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.020\nwith questions, with shit to conquer.\n\n01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.020\nThey go like, why is this thunder clapping?\n\n01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.020\nWhy did my friend die?\n\n01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.020\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:01.020\nWhy did a cheetah jump on my sister?\n\n01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.020\nAnd they go to the ends of the earth.\n\n01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.020\nWe're used to these stories where people climb beanstalks\n\n01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.020\nand we shrug it off.\n\n01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:10.020\nWe don't look at that and go, a beanstalk?\n\n01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.020\nThat's stupid.\n\n01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:17.020\nThese characters, they would just walk to the edge of the earth,\n\n01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:20.020\nwhich we thought existed, and then they would jump off it,\n\n01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.020\nand then an eagle would pick them up, and then the eagle would go,\n\n01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.020\nwhat are you doing?\n\n01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.020\nAnd they're like, you heard me, motherfucker.\n\n01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.020\nI want to talk to Apollo.\n\n01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.020\nAnd they'd go, all right.\n\n01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.020\nI'm just following orders.\n\n01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:34.020\nYou'd have interactions with these confusing weird forces\n\n01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:37.020\nat the time where characterizations of something\n\n01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.020\nthat people didn't understand.\n\n01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.020\nThey didn't invent monotheism yet.\n\n01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.020\nWe still thought that everything unexplained\n\n01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:44.020\nhad to have a different personality to it.\n\n01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.020\nSo it was amazing that we had these stories about it.\n\n01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:52.020\nSean Connery in this thing, he's this noble savage\n\n01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:55.020\nthat, he's not noble, what am I talking about?\n\n01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.020\nHe's a primitive savage who's,\n\n01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:01.020\nthe stone head comes down every day and goes like,\n\n01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.020\nI'm sort of, here's your guns.\n\n01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:06.020\nAnd it pukes up all these guns to him and all his friends.\n\n01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:09.020\nAnd he jumps in the mouth of the stone head,\n\n01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:11.020\nand he just arrives with it.\n\n01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.020\nThere are these brudels that live out like these people.\n\n01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.020\nThis sounds like the greatest movie of all time.\n\n01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:18.020\nIt's the greatest, it's the single greatest\n\n01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.020\nbeginning of a movie that's ever existed.\n\n01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.020\nIt starts off with a big head that looks like a big\n\n01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.020\ngum drop, a stone gum drop,\n\n01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:27.020\nand it's got a big kabuki face.\n\n01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.020\nAnd it comes out and goes, oh, it's all it does.\n\n01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:32.020\nThe gun is good, the penis is evil, and vomits guns.\n\n01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.020\nWait, it says the penis is evil?\n\n01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:39.020\nYes, it says, the penis shoots seed, which creates life,\n\n01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:42.020\nwhich horrifies the earth, the gun cleanses it of life.\n\n01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.020\nThe gun is good.\n\n01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.020\nThe gun shoots death, yeah.\n\n01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.020\nThe penis shoots seed, the gun shoots death.\n\n01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.020\nIt's basically, I mean, it's not a direct metaphor\n\n01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:54.020\nfor U.S. foreign policy, but it's like...\n\n01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:58.020\nYou know, Dan, this was written right after the\n\n01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.020\nGulf of Tonkin affair.\n\n01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:03.020\nIt's an exploration of any form of hegemony,\n\n01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.020\nbecause what it turns out is that these rich people who live...\n\n01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.020\nWait, is this a spoiler now?\n\n01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:11.020\nSean Connery hitches a ride to this stone head,\n\n01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.020\nand the first 10 minutes of this movie,\n\n01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:17.020\nthis head that pukes guns up to these poor people...\n\n01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.020\nIt says, the penis is evil.\n\n01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:21.020\nIt says, the penis is evil, go shoot all the people\n\n01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.020\nthat are reproducing it.\n\n01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.020\nAnd it has glitter rhinestone eyes.\n\n01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:28.020\nSean Connery shoots the camera, turns and shoots the camera,\n\n01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:30.020\nrepresenting his self-awareness.\n\n01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.020\nAnd then he goes...\n\n01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:36.020\nAfter the title sequence...\n\n01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.020\nI think that's, fuck you, Roger Moore.\n\n01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.020\nAfter the title sequence, Sean Connery emerges from\n\n01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.020\na pile of grain inside the mouth of the stone head.\n\n01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.020\nHe has hitched a ride inside his own god.\n\n01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:49.020\nHe shoots the guy who controls it.\n\n01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:52.020\nThe head rides on autopilot back to the suburban\n\n01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.020\nSilver Lake village where this guy lived.\n\n01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.020\nAnd in the first eight minutes of this movie,\n\n01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.020\nyou're watching Sean Connery with bandolier straps on\n\n01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:04.020\nand a red one clock and a red ponytail,\n\n01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:07.020\nwalking around a two-bedroom apartment in Silver Lake,\n\n01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:12.020\nlooking through music boxes of a guy that created his world.\n\n01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:14.020\nAnd going like, what the fuck?\n\n01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.020\nAnd he doesn't know, his whole life has just been\n\n01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:19.020\nraping and shooting, and he barely has language for it.\n\n01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:22.020\nAnd he's looking at the apartment of this guy.\n\n01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.020\nIt turns out all of life is just a fucking farce.\n\n01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.020\nBut unlike Gilgamesh,\n\n01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:29.020\nSean Connery's only blunder is that he emerged\n\n01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:32.020\ninto a future realized in the early 70s of filmmaking.\n\n01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:35.020\nWhere it turns into a really bad\n\n01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.020\ncommunity theater production of Pippin.\n\n01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:41.020\nAnd everybody is getting new, like doing little hand gestures.\n\n01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.020\nWell, everything eventually falls apart.\n\n01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.020\nThere's too much commentary on what was happening\n\n01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:48.020\nat that point in the 70s.\n\n01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.020\nThere's too much like, well, yeah.\n\n01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.020\nWell, boy, Pet Rocks today.\n\n01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.020\nWhat's next?\n\n01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.020\nPet Boulders?\n\n01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.020\nIt's like, well, no one's going to care about Pet Rocks\n\n01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.020\nin 2013 who were watching this.\n\n01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:01.020\nBut yeah, like transcendental meditation.\n\n01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.020\nObviously, it was a movie of its time.\n\n01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:07.020\nBut the thing that carries through, I think,\n\n01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:11.020\nis a bunch of rich, privileged people\n\n01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:13.020\nwho have achieved immortality,\n\n01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.020\nwhich is all our goal.\n\n01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:18.020\nAnd then these poor people are being created by them.\n\n01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:20.020\nOne person's in charge of them,\n\n01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.020\nlike a commissioner or a mayor\n\n01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.020\nis in charge of a basin of fucking poor people.\n\n01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.020\nOr a pop troller.\n\n01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:31.020\nAnd one of them pops into the immortal world\n\n01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.020\nand is walking around,\n\n01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.020\nand he's like sort of part Frankenstein part.\n\n01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.020\nHe's in the Matrix, too, doesn't he?\n\n01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:39.020\nAnd there's a scene where he's at a party\n\n01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:41.020\nand they're scanning his brain\n\n01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.020\nand all his rapes and murders that he's committed\n\n01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:47.020\nare on a screen behind him and all these fashionable people.\n\n01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.020\nBut now our rapes, if it's a rape murder,\n\n01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.020\ndoes that count as two?\n\n01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.020\nOr is this not the important question here?\n\n01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:56.020\nAnd they're at an art gallery\n\n01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.020\nand they're commenting on it and talking about it.\n\n01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.020\nAnd well, I think he's gauche.\n\n01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.020\nWell, I think he's supposed gauche.\n\n01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:05.020\nThen they try to get him...\n\n01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:10.020\nThis brutal savage\n\n01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:13.020\nhas a vestigial quality.\n\n01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.020\nHis penis can achieve two mesons\n\n01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:19.020\nand become rigid in an erection.\n\n01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.020\nWait, so they don't get boners?\n\n01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.020\nYeah, they can't.\n\n01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.020\nBecause they're immortal.\n\n01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.020\nThey don't need to re-perhence them.\n\n01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.020\nWhy they can't die so they cannot get a heart attack?\n\n01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.020\nThey're actually immortal,\n\n01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:29.020\nnot like poetically immortal.\n\n01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.020\nBut they punish you if you fuck up in a society\n\n01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.020\nand you do anything bad.\n\n01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.020\nThey can punish you by aging you five years\n\n01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:35.020\nand eventually you'll die.\n\n01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.020\nNo, eventually you will never die.\n\n01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.020\nEventually you'll be senile.\n\n01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.020\nYou'll become senile forever.\n\n01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.020\nYou'll be an old person and then...\n\n01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.020\nYou'll become a renegade.\n\n01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.020\nOr a renegade.\n\n01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.020\nYeah, renegade are the crazy senile people.\n\n01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.020\nOr you can become an apathetic and be sexy but stupid.\n\n01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.020\nAnd they're in a permanent kind of New Year's Eve party\n\n01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:52.020\nwhere they're wearing tuxes like,\n\n01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.020\nReed as the Oscars.\n\n01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:57.020\nThey're all just like popping champagne\n\n01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:00.020\nand kind of stumbling around with their prosthetic makeup.\n\n01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:01.020\nAnd they show...\n\n01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:02.020\nIt's pretty funny that they...\n\n01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:03.020\nBecause they have a little thing,\n\n01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.020\nthey have a ring where they can make a little computer\n\n01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:06.020\nand it's a lot like Siri.\n\n01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:07.020\nIt's a lot like an iPhone.\n\n01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.020\nBut they're like, hey, what's this?\n\n01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:09.020\nIt's a flower. For what?\n\n01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.020\nFor decoration.\n\n01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.020\nOh, thank you, Siri.\n\n01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.020\nThat's nice.\n\n01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:13.020\nAnd you can put...\n\n01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:16.020\nYou can put a little screen up on the wall\n\n01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.020\nlike a projector.\n\n01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:18.020\nIt's pretty groovy.\n\n01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.020\nBut then they're trying to prove\n\n01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.020\nthat they can get this guy hard.\n\n01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.020\nSo all these ladies are standing around\n\n01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.020\nin their past-whole rows.\n\n01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.020\nSean Connery.\n\n01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:26.020\nSean Connery standing in a red diaper?\n\n01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.020\nDiaper.\n\n01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.020\nShort shorts.\n\n01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.020\nIt's like American apparel, like ladies' short shorts.\n\n01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.020\nAnd he's got his balding man ponytail.\n\n01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:37.020\nHe's got a ponytail with a slight receding hairline,\n\n01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.020\na handlebar mustache,\n\n01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:43.020\nand knee-high, like Captain Cook boots on.\n\n01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.020\nHow have I missed this movie?\n\n01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.020\nIt's a mistake.\n\n01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.020\nIt's so good.\n\n01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.020\nYeah, it's nuts.\n\n01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.020\nBut then they start showing them porn.\n\n01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.020\nLike, watch this.\n\n01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.020\nI'm going to show you a man, get a boner.\n\n01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.020\nAnd all the ladies are standing around.\n\n01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.020\nI've never seen that before.\n\n01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.020\nAnd the first in this show is just a tits.\n\n01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:59.020\nYeah, soapy titties.\n\n01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.020\nThe woman is like soap and upper titties.\n\n01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.020\nLike a big, like tight frame.\n\n01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.020\nIt works as modern porn.\n\n01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.020\nYeah, no.\n\n01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:07.020\nIt was hot.\n\n01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:12.020\nLike the soapy titties was trans-like.\n\n01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.020\nBecause at first I wanted to mock it.\n\n01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.020\nI was like soapy titties.\n\n01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.020\nAnd then I was like, Jesus.\n\n01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.020\nI felt a little tangled.\n\n01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:22.020\nI felt a little tangled.\n\n01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:28.020\nI was assumed that a woman like soapy, like rubbing her boobs with soapy water was like,\n\n01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:32.020\nthat that was just like the same thing as a woman laying on the hood of a Ferrari.\n\n01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.020\nIt was just like a needless, like stylistic thing.\n\n01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.020\nOh, soapy is necessary and awesome.\n\n01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:39.020\nAt the end of the day, a naked lady is a naked lady.\n\n01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.020\nLike kind of like who cares?\n\n01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.020\nLike the idea that high heels or something.\n\n01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.020\nOh, the activity of that thing.\n\n01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.020\nWow.\n\n01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.020\nOkay, soapy.\n\n01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:47.020\nYeah, but he looks at that one and nothing happens.\n\n01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.020\nAnd he kind of shakes it off.\n\n01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.020\nLike Fernando Bellam's whaling.\n\n01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.020\nLike that pitch isn't good.\n\n01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.020\nAnd then they show another one of just two women in mud.\n\n01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.020\nAnd that was notably less sexy.\n\n01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.020\nYeah, that one.\n\n01:09:56.020 --> 01:10:02.020\nAnd then you notice that Sean Conner is just staring at the woman who's kind of been the negative Nellie.\n\n01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.020\nLike she hates him the most.\n\n01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:04.020\nShe's not in the mud pitch.\n\n01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.020\nNo, she's putting on the presentation.\n\n01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.020\nShe's a curator.\n\n01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.020\nAnd then everyone's eyes kind of cast down.\n\n01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.020\nAnd he's standing there completely stone faced just looking at the woman.\n\n01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.020\nAnd clearly has got a boner.\n\n01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.020\nOh, Jesus Christ.\n\n01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:21.020\nThe boner computer guy, bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou.\n\n01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.020\nHow have I not seen this movie.\n\n01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.020\nNone of, none of your descriptions.\n\n01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:27.020\nAnd you've been describing it collectively for about 20 minutes,\n\n01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.020\nmaybe.\n\n01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.020\nOh god I hope not.\n\n01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:33.020\nNo single minute of that makes it sound like anything less than the best movie.\n\n01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.020\nWell, Chris McKenna, one of Dan's writers in community,\n\n01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:39.020\nand lovely fellow put disease in Zardas left.\n\n01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:42.020\nHe was snoring all the way through.\n\n01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:46.940\nIt's like a fishing lure, like the head of it has its impact, and then it just tapers\n\n01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.860\noff into this lullaby.\n\n01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:53.300\nI can't believe there hasn't been a t-shirt with a stone-faced guy with glowing eyes that\n\n01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.900\nsays the penis is evil.\n\n01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:55.900\nI bet there is.\n\n01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.900\nI'm certain there is.\n\n01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:58.900\nThere's nothing.\n\n01:10:58.900 --> 01:10:59.900\nYeah.\n\n01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.060\nIt's 106 minutes.\n\n01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.060\nIt's definitely worth watching.\n\n01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:08.620\nWait, so the rest of the movie is him in the immortal people world?\n\n01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.100\nMost of it, yeah.\n\n01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:15.300\nThe movie basically starts with him penetrating that veil, yeah.\n\n01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:20.620\nAs the movie continues, it reveals more truths than a Shyamalan in kind of a way that really\n\n01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:24.660\nonly served a disappoint, because actually the story I was invested in was a savage,\n\n01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:28.860\nkind of naively bounding into this world and interacting with the immortals.\n\n01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:32.820\nIt turns out, oh, it's all a big thing.\n\n01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:37.180\nIt gets increasingly transcendental and increasingly 70s.\n\n01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:38.180\nWhat's the big?\n\n01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.740\nHe can say spoiler alert and then tell me what the big, is that okay if we tell, it's\n\n01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:42.740\nZardaz.\n\n01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:43.740\nYou haven't seen it in 40 years.\n\n01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:44.740\nNo, I'm telling you.\n\n01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:47.500\nIt's too much a component of the enjoyment of the movie.\n\n01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:53.140\nFor people who haven't seen the movie, the spoiler, the big spoiler, which actually means\n\n01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:59.380\nnot, it's not important to the plot of the film, but it's such a delicious, ridiculous\n\n01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:00.380\nspoiler.\n\n01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:01.380\nNo, I'm not going to say it.\n\n01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.900\nWatch the fucking movie.\n\n01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.380\nIt's the one reward for watching that thing.\n\n01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.900\nAll right, enough.\n\n01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.100\nSpencer, how you been, man?\n\n01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:14.380\nYeah, you know, Zardaz, I thought that whole reveal was kind of, you know, it was worth\n\n01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:19.980\nit, but really, was I invested, I mean, there was the renegades and there was the apathetics,\n\n01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:23.860\nbut at the end of the day, I mean, it really peaked with the whole penis.\n\n01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.980\nI didn't watch it.\n\n01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.980\nYou've never seen it.\n\n01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:28.980\nDid that sound good?\n\n01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:29.980\nYou've never seen it?\n\n01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:30.980\nYeah, no, not at all.\n\n01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:31.980\nYou motherfucker.\n\n01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:32.980\nYeah.\n\n01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:38.820\nI was going to go, I got, yeah, I had a work meeting that night, I was going to go, you\n\n01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:39.820\nknow, head over.\n\n01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:43.580\nYou never have to have an excuse to have not watched Zardaz.\n\n01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:48.180\nI would have enjoyed seeing it.\n\n01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:50.340\nIt slows all the way down now.\n\n01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:55.020\nIt has that 70s patience, like Rollerball starts off like the best movie you've ever\n\n01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:56.020\nseen.\n\n01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:59.100\nJames Cohn's in a roller derby competition with a big metal ball and everyone has spikes\n\n01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.740\non and it's been her and like, what the fuck, this is the best, and then there's 45 minutes\n\n01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.060\nof people at a cocktail party, but light a tree on fire.\n\n01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.060\nLighting up trees.\n\n01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.060\nYeah, it's so stupid.\n\n01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:09.060\nYeah.\n\n01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:10.060\nWell, that's the 70s for you.\n\n01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:11.060\nWhat?\n\n01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.900\nIt was like, on one hand, you did, it was like Harvintown.\n\n01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:18.820\nYou have no idea, you have no, no guarantees, like you don't, you don't know, like Robin\n\n01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:23.500\nWilliams shows up, I drop my pants, I confess to bisexuality or playing with matches.\n\n01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.660\nWho knows?\n\n01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.660\nYou might, you might.\n\n01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.900\nThat's the same Zardaz guy.\n\n01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:33.380\nLittle Pyromaniac, look, the, the, on the other hand, it could just be a boring show.\n\n01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:39.060\nThat's just, everything, all the chairs are from Tyler, he's just, he's jamming on E-Nicotine\n\n01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.060\nright now.\n\n01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:41.060\nYeah.\n\n01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:42.060\nHe's been smoking those 18 milligram.\n\n01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:45.060\nDude, I'm going to give you a throat hit in a second, man.\n\n01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:49.500\nBut if you read, if you read that, uh, Easy Riders Raging Bulls story, it's the story\n\n01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.620\nof that, that, that Sin Escape changing.\n\n01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:56.180\nBut you were saying partly joking that, that as soon as they blew up the shark and Jaws,\n\n01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:01.620\nthat as the point when movies became, I mean, we were all born into, certainly these people,\n\n01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:08.180\neven me, were born into a world that had been pre-jossed, like, like we don't, we, movies\n\n01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.660\nare part of our government.\n\n01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:14.060\nIt's the fifth estate, you know, it's, it's, it's, it is, it is our religion.\n\n01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:18.220\nWe go to these temples and we study these things and, and they are, there's a prerequisite\n\n01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.100\nfor these things, that they have to have a third act.\n\n01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:25.420\nUm, uh, the Death Star's got to blow up, the shark's got to blow up, the, the, the, the\n\n01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:28.620\npeople got to go home feeling like there's a purpose in their life.\n\n01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:33.380\nUm, and, and the, but there was a point before that when, you know, it was like, hey, it's\n\n01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:36.340\njust a movie, whatever, it's just another way to make money.\n\n01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:39.660\nYou could buy a Styx album or you might go to see this thing.\n\n01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.740\nIt's got Gene Hackman in it, he eats some chocolate, he jerks off in a cup and then\n\n01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:43.740\nhe shoots himself.\n\n01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.740\nThat sounds like a third act.\n\n01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.740\nThe chocolate and the suicide?\n\n01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:52.740\nThat's, that's the French connection, right?\n\n01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.740\nI'll recommend one.\n\n01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.900\nI'll recommend one movie from the seventies that's really, really awesome that a lot of\n\n01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:01.660\npeople haven't seen this movie called, uh, Abominable Dr. Fibes.\n\n01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.100\nIt's a, uh, Vincent Price movie.\n\n01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.100\nIt's his best role.\n\n01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:09.020\nIt's an amazing movie that you were, like you were saying, it's a product of its time,\n\n01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.020\ndefinitely.\n\n01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:11.020\nLet's make that the assignment.\n\n01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:12.020\nLet's watch.\n\n01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.020\nI've never seen it.\n\n01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:14.020\nLet's watch it.\n\n01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:15.020\nAbominable Dr. Fibes is fucking awesome.\n\n01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:16.020\nIt's one of my favorite movies.\n\n01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.820\nWatch that for next week, Harmon, Harmonian.\n\n01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:18.820\nI'm sure Schrab has.\n\n01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.540\nI think we'll watch it there and, you know, you probably fall asleep.\n\n01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.820\nIt'd be harder to come by, probably not on iTunes.\n\n01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:30.420\nUm, yeah, I don't know what it, all right, so, so does it miss, Kevin iTunes?\n\n01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.380\nThe Abominable Dr. Fibes.\n\n01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.380\nAbominable.\n\n01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.380\nWatch the first one.\n\n01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:37.060\nDon't watch Dr. Fibes rises again.\n\n01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:38.060\nWatch the first one.\n\n01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.060\nIs that a joke?\n\n01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.060\nNo.\n\n01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.060\nOh shit.\n\n01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.860\nThe real, I think it's great, but you got to start where it starts.\n\n01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.860\nAll right.\n\n01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:45.860\nOkay.\n\n01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:46.860\nAre there, are there, yeah.\n\n01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:50.300\nWell, I want to, are there any, is there a woman in the audience who's had, who, who,\n\n01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.420\nwhat woman thinks she's had the worst day?\n\n01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.420\nI've had.\n\n01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.420\nTyler?\n\n01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.580\nWe're not talking to you.\n\n01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:59.620\nWe heard about all your e-cigarettes, uh, there's a lady in front.\n\n01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.900\nIs there, are there any, oh, are you raising your hand?\n\n01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.780\nAre you willing, are you willing to come up here?\n\n01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:04.780\nSure.\n\n01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:06.780\nWill you, will you play Aaron's part and Dungeons and Dragons?\n\n01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:07.780\nOkay.\n\n01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:08.780\nAll right, what's your name?\n\n01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:09.780\nStephanie, everybody.\n\n01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:10.780\nYes.\n\n01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:11.780\nMulray and Sedona.\n\n01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.780\nTonight, the role of Mulray will be played by Stephanie.\n\n01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:16.980\nStephanie, what was so bad about your day?\n\n01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:19.180\nUh, I got yelled at by my boss.\n\n01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:22.180\nYeah, that's the worst thing that happened today.\n\n01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:26.260\nI'm sorry, I'm just goofing around.\n\n01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:27.260\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:29.260\nI just, obviously, subjective experiences.\n\n01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:34.020\nI know, but I, I felt that today, definitely, like, I called my mom to complain about my\n\n01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.860\nboss yelling at me, and she, she said that to me, just like, really.\n\n01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.700\nBut it doesn't mean your boss yelling at you wasn't shitty, you know?\n\n01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:40.700\nIt was still shitty.\n\n01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:41.700\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\n01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.700\nWhat's, what's the gig?\n\n01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.180\nUh, I work in an animal shelter.\n\n01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.180\nOh, Jesus.\n\n01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.180\nWow.\n\n01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:47.180\nWell, is your boss is yelling at you?\n\n01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:49.180\nYou're not killing enough kittens.\n\n01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:50.180\nYeah, right.\n\n01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.180\nI actually work at a no-kill shelter.\n\n01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.180\nOh.\n\n01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.180\nWhat was she, what was your boss?\n\n01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:54.180\nYou killed too many kittens.\n\n01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.180\nRead the sign, Stephanie.\n\n01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:57.180\nNo.\n\n01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.180\nYou killed five.\n\n01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.180\nSorry.\n\n01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:00.180\nOh.\n\n01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:03.180\nWhat, what, what was her, uh, what was her beef with you today?\n\n01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:06.180\nBy the way, we're all assuming the boss is a she, is it?\n\n01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:07.180\nNo.\n\n01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.180\nIt is not.\n\n01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:10.180\nI think that's very progressive of us.\n\n01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.180\nI guess only women can say it.\n\n01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:13.180\nI have a riddle for you.\n\n01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:15.180\nTwo kittens go into an animal shelter.\n\n01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.180\nThe doctor's a guy.\n\n01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:20.180\nThe doctor says, oh shit, okay.\n\n01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.180\nI cannot throw this kitten into a waste basket.\n\n01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:24.180\nIt's my kitten.\n\n01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.180\nThe doctor's a doc.\n\n01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:29.180\nThe doctor's a doc.\n\n01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.180\nI've already heard it.\n\n01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.180\nI've heard it.\n\n01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.180\nWhat, what was her hang up with you today?\n\n01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:35.180\nWhat, what had she done wrong?\n\n01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.180\nIt's a long story.\n\n01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:42.180\nUh, basically, he, basically he accused me of trying to steal money from the company.\n\n01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:43.180\nUh.\n\n01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:45.180\nIs there a lot of money to be made?\n\n01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:48.180\nIt's not exactly the boiler room with Vin Diesel.\n\n01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:49.180\nNo.\n\n01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:53.180\nAlways be closing on the kitten adoptions.\n\n01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:57.180\nI think there's a character you work with who's always talking to the camera.\n\n01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.180\nLet me explain how animal shelter works.\n\n01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.180\nThe kittens come in one door.\n\n01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:03.180\nPeople love them.\n\n01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.180\nThen they adopt them.\n\n01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:09.180\nEveryone want, grandma goes home happy, but cha-ching.\n\n01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.180\nFollow the money.\n\n01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:16.180\nThe coffee is for adopters.\n\n01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.180\nIt's okay.\n\n01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.180\nWe have a mentally unstable guy that makes our coffee, so it's fine.\n\n01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:20.180\nWhat was it?\n\n01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:26.180\nIs there, is there like a, is there like a till at the, at the animal shelter that came up short?\n\n01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:27.180\nNo.\n\n01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:29.180\nSomebody's dividend in the animal shelter.\n\n01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.180\nNo kill animal shelter.\n\n01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.180\nWe, we not killed six ferrets.\n\n01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:35.180\nThere's, there's 720 in this register.\n\n01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:40.180\nUm, no, they were, they were accusing me more of stealing time money.\n\n01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.180\nThey were saying that I worked more out.\n\n01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.180\nOh.\n\n01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:46.180\nI did that when I was a data entry clerk.\n\n01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:49.180\nI was like, who knows if I'm entering data.\n\n01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:51.180\nBut not killing animals.\n\n01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.180\nA higher stakes job to be.\n\n01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.180\nYeah.\n\n01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.180\nCause all of a sudden there's just like, yeah.\n\n01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.180\nIf you don't show up to work on time, kittens die, right?\n\n01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:00.180\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.180\nNo, not really.\n\n01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:05.180\nSo your job is about getting animals rescued and stuff?\n\n01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:06.180\nYeah.\n\n01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.180\nUm, trying to get them adopted more or less.\n\n01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:14.180\nI work for specifically polls animals from LA shelters that are high kill.\n\n01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:17.180\nSo trying to make LA a no kill city.\n\n01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:18.180\nThat's the whole thing.\n\n01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:24.180\nYou go to other shelters and, and, and, and take like, like, like load up a truck and take\n\n01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.180\nthem to the no kill shelter.\n\n01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.180\nYep.\n\n01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.180\nYep.\n\n01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.180\nHow does the money come to the no kill shelter?\n\n01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.180\nHow do you keep the lights on?\n\n01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:30.180\nI have no idea.\n\n01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.180\nI don't know.\n\n01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:32.180\nWell, where do you guys make money?\n\n01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.180\nYou must know where, where the money comes from.\n\n01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:35.180\nSomething.\n\n01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.180\nShe only knows where it goes.\n\n01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.180\nIn her pocket.\n\n01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:40.180\nMore than should be.\n\n01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.180\nUm, no, it's a huge, it's a huge organization.\n\n01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:49.180\nIt's, it's been around for like 40 years and they have lots of, lots and lots and lots\n\n01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.180\nof donors.\n\n01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.180\nSo.\n\n01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.180\nFollow the money.\n\n01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:53.180\nI'm not.\n\n01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:54.180\nTake it easy, Tyler.\n\n01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.180\nAll right.\n\n01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.180\nLet's play a bit of D&D.\n\n01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:00.180\nStephanie, you're going to help us out and play Aaron's role of Mulray and Sedona tonight.\n\n01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.180\nToo much pressure.\n\n01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.180\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.180\nYou'll be good.\n\n01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.180\nYou'll be good.\n\n01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.180\nYeah.\n\n01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.180\nYou'll be good.\n\n01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:10.180\nYour, your job is much more pressure than.\n\n01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:13.180\nAlso Aaron, Aaron told me in advance, I don't know if you heard last week's show.\n\n01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:14.180\nWere you here for last week's show?\n\n01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:15.180\nNo, I was not.\n\n01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:16.180\nOkay.\n\n01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:20.180\nWell, Aaron developed a new trick for fighting invisible enemies called the rope, rope.\n\n01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.180\nRope packer.\n\n01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:22.180\nRope packer.\n\n01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:26.180\nAnd she said that you're allowed to use it.\n\n01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:30.180\nBut Jeff's not allowed to fuck it.\n\n01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.180\nThose were her specific instructions.\n\n01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:32.180\nWe'll see.\n\n01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:36.180\nI'm going to have benign violation of Coco tonight.\n\n01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:39.180\nShe's just going to take money from it.\n\n01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.180\nAll right, Spencer.\n\n01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:41.180\nWhat'd I do?\n\n01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:43.180\nSpencer, kick us off if you would please.\n\n01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.180\nOkay.\n\n01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:51.180\nLast time on Harmon Time, our heroes were on their way towards the thicket of ebb and\n\n01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:56.180\npillars, but soon they lost their bearings, assuming they had possessed them in the first\n\n01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.180\nplace.\n\n01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:01.180\nBewildered and surrounded by pillars, Quark climbed the phallic columns and spied with\n\n01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:05.180\nlow light vision, a blob of color on the tip of a far off pillar.\n\n01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:09.180\nAbout that time, strange squishing sounds began to surround the heroes.\n\n01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:13.180\nWith an air of urgency, the heroes headed towards the far off column.\n\n01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:17.180\nAs the heroes approached the sought after pillar, the squishing continued.\n\n01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.180\nThe colored shape called out.\n\n01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.180\nIt was a person.\n\n01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:24.180\nSharpie casting levitate began to approach the old man and Quark climbed up his pillar\n\n01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:27.180\nto regard the white clothed old man.\n\n01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:32.180\nAnd Chris took some turns sending correspondence to the pillar dwelling Herman and Quark and\n\n01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:34.180\nSharpie also had some words.\n\n01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:38.180\nBefore the whole ensemble moved back down to the ground level, the old man named Breffie,\n\n01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:42.180\nas it happened, warned the heroes that they were under assault from a gaggle of deadly\n\n01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:47.180\nphantom funguses, which were funguses and definitely not fungi in this specific instance.\n\n01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:52.180\nThe gang slew the monsters with a far sword blast and a fireball spell, which quickly\n\n01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:53.180\nignited the ebb and pillars.\n\n01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:58.180\nRunning quickly, they tore through the forest and came upon a web slung mass in the ebb and thicken.\n\n01:21:58.180 --> 01:21:59.180\nWoo!\n\n01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.180\nSpencer!\n\n01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:01.180\nSpencer!\n\n01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:06.180\nI gotta say, man, you're in the zone tonight.\n\n01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:07.180\nYou came up in the zone?\n\n01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:08.180\nYeah.\n\n01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.180\nI feel like you came loaded for bear.\n\n01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:15.180\nWell, I feel like if you're like to do baseball or something, I only went at bat twice.\n\n01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:19.180\nSo, you know, hitting two, two, you know, balls is easy.\n\n01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:21.180\nI guess this would be the third.\n\n01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.180\nYeah.\n\n01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:25.180\nThis one's more of a base hit.\n\n01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:26.180\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:29.180\nSo, I mean, that's still, that's really good stats in baseball.\n\n01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:33.180\nYou know, there's an alternate world where D&D is like the biggest sport and you're the\n\n01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:37.180\npresident of that world, because you're fucking amazing at it.\n\n01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:43.180\nWait, why is it two, I didn't get the, you know, why is it two times at bat?\n\n01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.180\nI don't understand.\n\n01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:49.180\nOh, because when I first came up, I had the comment about your, you know, I was narrating\n\n01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:50.180\nthat, I think that went over well.\n\n01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.180\nHe's two for two, he's saying.\n\n01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:52.180\nYeah.\n\n01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:55.180\nIn baseball, if you hit three out of ten, you're in the Hall of Fame.\n\n01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:56.180\nOh, I see.\n\n01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.180\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:01.180\nBut I mean, it's easier, it's easy to say I'm doing good if I said two things and both\n\n01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:02.180\nof them went decently well.\n\n01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:06.180\nSpeaking of doing good, I would like to share a triumph with my own.\n\n01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.180\nYou're doing great.\n\n01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.180\nThank you.\n\n01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:13.180\nI recently bought a new MacBook Pro and it's hardware is sophisticated enough to run a\n\n01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:17.180\nMinecraft with all of the mods that I have had my eye on.\n\n01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:19.180\nGod, that's great news.\n\n01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:23.180\nThis is already the opposite of the Boston bomb story.\n\n01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:28.180\nWell, I didn't, you know, it was not my fault that that happened today.\n\n01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:29.180\nSure.\n\n01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.180\nWe don't know that.\n\n01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:36.180\nI, crazy white guy.\n\n01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:42.180\nThis is getting less benign and more deviant.\n\n01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:50.180\nThere's a lot of, it's called the tech world mod pack in Minecraft and it includes a lot\n\n01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:54.580\nof generators and electronic things and Minecraft is a game of like mining things and you mine\n\n01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:59.180\nore and then you smelt it into other things and you use those tools to mine ore ore.\n\n01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:04.180\nI, in tech world, I created an automatic miner.\n\n01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:11.180\nSo I, when I play Minecraft now, I just have a little box that plays Minecraft for me.\n\n01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:15.180\nAnd it mines for me and it just like sucks up the ore and I just collect it.\n\n01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.180\nSo you're just crafting.\n\n01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:17.180\nYeah.\n\n01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:18.180\nSo it's just craft.\n\n01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:20.180\nThe glee on your face is so awesome.\n\n01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.180\nWell, because I think that's so funny.\n\n01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:25.180\nI saw a guy walking on the street today and he had a shirt that said, I love Minecraft\n\n01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:28.180\nand I wept openly.\n\n01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:29.180\nFor humanity?\n\n01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.180\nYes.\n\n01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:33.180\nThat's a game I could never get into.\n\n01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:34.180\nI've watched you play.\n\n01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:36.180\nIt's fun to watch you play because it's fun watching.\n\n01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:40.180\nIt's only, it's unlike any other thing because I mean, like you're talking about games like\n\n01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:44.180\nOblivion, the Elder Scrolls games, that we characterize those as like, oh shit, that's\n\n01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:45.180\nthe hero in a video game.\n\n01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:48.180\nSo I played that for 100 hours, 200 hours, you know, whatever.\n\n01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:53.180\nLike, I've been playing Minecraft for three, four years because they keep coming out with\n\n01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:54.180\nupdates.\n\n01:24:54.180 --> 01:25:01.180\nIt's beyond sandbox into just, it's a combination of knitting, smoking and jerking off.\n\n01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:04.180\nLike it's just a thing you can do at an airport.\n\n01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:07.180\nYou can do it while you're, you can't jerk off at an airport.\n\n01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.180\nYou can knit at an airport.\n\n01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:10.180\nI'm just saying there's different tentacles.\n\n01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.180\nYou can jerk off at an airport.\n\n01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:15.180\nBut you can't smoke.\n\n01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.180\nSpencer!\n\n01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:17.180\nYeah, oh yeah.\n\n01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.180\nYou don't have to jerk off at an airport.\n\n01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.180\nIt's easier to jerk off than so.\n\n01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.180\nYou can do both.\n\n01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:24.180\nNot at the same time.\n\n01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:25.180\nThat's absurd.\n\n01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:29.180\nThey can tell you're jerking off and they can see your feet under the stall like shaking.\n\n01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:30.180\nLike gyrating.\n\n01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:32.180\nYou have to see them gyrating.\n\n01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:35.180\nThey're going, who fucking, they're going to Hawaii or something.\n\n01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:37.180\nWho are they gonna tell?\n\n01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.180\nI'm nervous that the tropical climate.\n\n01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:41.180\nThey still don't want to see a guy jerking off on the way to the plane.\n\n01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:45.180\nThat's the least of my worries while I'm jerking off in an airport.\n\n01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:50.180\nWeirdest thing I ever saw at LAX, I walked right where the baggage carousels are.\n\n01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.180\nThere's a bathroom right there.\n\n01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.180\nI walked in the bathroom door.\n\n01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:55.180\nThis was like 98.\n\n01:25:55.180 --> 01:26:04.180\nAnd there was a bathroom stall wide open and there was a guy facing away, bent over,\n\n01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:12.180\npants around his ankles, ass cheeks like like like ass hole pointed at anyone that walked\n\n01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:15.180\nin the door, stalled her wide open.\n\n01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:21.180\nBut with a little like toilet paper like in a little Halloween ghost shape, like like\n\n01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:26.180\nlike kind of like dabbing at his asshole, like he was like wamping his ass but wanted\n\n01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.180\nAmerica to know.\n\n01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:31.180\nAnd you said to him, captain.\n\n01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:34.180\nThat's right.\n\n01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:37.180\nI didn't say anything but I stared for a minute.\n\n01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.180\nI was like what?\n\n01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:41.180\nI was like a deer in headlights.\n\n01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:44.180\nAnd I'll never know what the guy, where's he from?\n\n01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.180\nWhere is that a thing?\n\n01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:47.180\nIt was opposite.\n\n01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:51.180\nSo he was wiping his ass at America.\n\n01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.180\nHe was making a statement.\n\n01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:55.180\nMaybe he was like this is what I do in Bangladesh.\n\n01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:56.180\nI don't know.\n\n01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:59.180\nMaybe it's like you know, did he have a brown ass?\n\n01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:01.180\nNo, I will tell you this.\n\n01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:03.180\nTell me this little.\n\n01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:07.180\nI really hope it's a crazy white guy.\n\n01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.180\nThey can't all be crazy white guys.\n\n01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:15.180\nAnd again, I'll tell you please for the second time tonight, respect my candor.\n\n01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:19.180\nReward me for it because I could, I could pretend that this isn't in my head.\n\n01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:20.180\nI got it.\n\n01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.180\nI seem to recall that he was an olive skinned gentleman.\n\n01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:26.180\nHey, good job on that candor.\n\n01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:30.180\nSo you saw a brown butt wiping its ass at America.\n\n01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:33.180\nI, I, I, I, I saw an ass.\n\n01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.180\nMaybe there was like a dry run of 9-11.\n\n01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:37.180\nI saw, I saw it.\n\n01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:38.180\nThe stakes were much lower.\n\n01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:39.180\nI saw an asshole.\n\n01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:42.180\nI saw the weirdest thing in the, in my life.\n\n01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:44.180\nBut he was dabbing it delicately with a little, with a little peep.\n\n01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:45.180\nIt was, it was, I wish I could.\n\n01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:49.180\nMaybe he was doing the old like come here, come hit her like the dropped handkerchief bits.\n\n01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:50.180\nYou know, he was like.\n\n01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.180\nIt was simultaneously.\n\n01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:53.180\nBut I'll tell you what you're gonna get.\n\n01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:59.180\nIt was simultaneously the most private act, but performed so publicly.\n\n01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:04.180\nLike almost like you would think like, oh, he's, he wants me to see this.\n\n01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:06.180\nBut he's not paying attention to me.\n\n01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.180\nStephanie, how you doing up there?\n\n01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:08.180\nYou having fun?\n\n01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:09.180\nJust great.\n\n01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.180\nYeah.\n\n01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:12.180\nThere's a re, I think we can come up with a reason why he was doing that.\n\n01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:17.180\nWhat if, if I'm there, and I'm using my phone and I'm on the toilet.\n\n01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:19.180\nI was just trying to find out if Thunder was Zeus.\n\n01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:20.180\nIt's a little bit.\n\n01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:22.180\nYour human desire to make sense of it.\n\n01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:23.180\nExactly.\n\n01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:24.180\nWe're finding Zeus here.\n\n01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.180\nI'm texting.\n\n01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:28.180\nAs soon as I'm done, I drop my phone in the toilet.\n\n01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:31.180\nAnd so I get up and I'm looking for in the toilet.\n\n01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:34.180\nAnd then I'm like, oh shit, my ass is still unwiped.\n\n01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.180\nSo I'm like, I'll do both.\n\n01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:42.180\nSo I get toilet paper and I'm wiping my ass while I'm looking in the toilet bowl for the phone.\n\n01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:43.180\nThat's definitely it.\n\n01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.180\nThat's definitely it.\n\n01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:46.180\nThat's what Dr. Bangladesh was up to.\n\n01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:48.180\nThe door open.\n\n01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:51.180\nThe open door is another mystery.\n\n01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:53.180\nWhy, there are four phones in 98.\n\n01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.180\nIt was pre-9-11.\n\n01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:56.180\nThat's for sure.\n\n01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:58.180\nI don't know why that's significant.\n\n01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:02.180\nOh dude, that's a total 9-10 story.\n\n01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:08.180\nThis is like Mr. Show era.\n\n01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.180\nAlright Spencer, what are we looking at?\n\n01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:13.180\nBefore 9-11, I measured time of what season of Mr. Show was on.\n\n01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:16.180\nThere were only four years before 9-11.\n\n01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:20.180\nUntil HBO canceled existence.\n\n01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:23.180\nSo Spencer, did we defeat the Funguses?\n\n01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:24.180\nYeah, you killed them.\n\n01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:27.180\nYeah, I mean we could keep talking.\n\n01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:31.180\nIf we keep going like 20 more minutes, I won't have to write anything next week.\n\n01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:36.180\nNo, we're about to go into a phase spider world.\n\n01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:44.180\nSo you guys remember, you had sliced one in half and Sharpie had cast a fireball that blew up the other one\n\n01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:48.180\nand it lit the pillars on fire.\n\n01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:50.180\nYeah, and then we ran into a phase spider thing.\n\n01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:53.180\nSpencer, I cast fireball on the spider area.\n\n01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:55.180\nI'm fucking charging in.\n\n01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:56.180\nDo it.\n\n01:29:56.180 --> 01:30:00.180\nThis national tragedy has filled me with like, fuck it, no regrets.\n\n01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:03.180\nWe're still fighting phase spiders.\n\n01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:04.180\nFireball!\n\n01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:05.180\nWell, you aren't fighting anything.\n\n01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.180\nThere's no fighting.\n\n01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:07.180\nNo, I don't care.\n\n01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:08.180\nI'm fighting the unknown.\n\n01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:09.180\nYeah, I was talking to Jeff.\n\n01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:10.180\nI'm in a panic.\n\n01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:11.180\nYeah, definitely.\n\n01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:12.180\nThis is a pre-emptive strike.\n\n01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:14.180\nCasting fireball on a...\n\n01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:17.180\nCrazy white guy!\n\n01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:22.180\nAnd the massive web of webs, the webby mass of webs, the webby mass of mass.\n\n01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:24.180\nWhy is there a dollar?\n\n01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:28.180\nThe Federal Reserve needs to make hand crank radios.\n\n01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:34.180\nI feel like more than ever today we should try and reason with the spider rather than\n\n01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:36.180\ntrying to just set a bomb.\n\n01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.180\nNo, they teach at universities.\n\n01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:39.180\nDie!\n\n01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:47.180\nOkay, so, Sharpie casts fireball on what I'm assuming is like the center of like the\n\n01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:49.180\nwebby mass or something, yeah?\n\n01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.180\nYeah.\n\n01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:51.180\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:55.180\nSo it hits, it strikes one of the nets, and immediately bursts into flames.\n\n01:30:55.180 --> 01:31:00.180\nNow, if you recall, fire is slightly less effective on the shadow plane.\n\n01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:01.180\nHowever...\n\n01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:02.180\nWe don't remember being told.\n\n01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:05.180\nYeah, no one remembers anything that happens.\n\n01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:09.180\nBut, uh, yeah.\n\n01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:13.180\nNo, but, yeah, someone pulled out a torch and it didn't light very well.\n\n01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:14.180\nRight.\n\n01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:16.180\nIt's like Langoliers.\n\n01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.180\nSure.\n\n01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.180\nIt's like Zardos.\n\n01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:20.180\nYou didn't see Zardos.\n\n01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:21.180\nI know.\n\n01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:24.180\nI didn't see Land-o-lakes either.\n\n01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:26.180\nLangoliers fucking rocks, dude.\n\n01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:28.180\nYeah, you should watch Langoliers, Spencer.\n\n01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:29.180\nOh, watch all nine hours of it.\n\n01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:31.180\nValky from Perfect Strange is in it.\n\n01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:34.180\nI promise there's a payoff.\n\n01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:40.180\nSpencer, is the webby mass being tied at any major points?\n\n01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:42.180\nAre there major points of tethering to the web?\n\n01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:45.180\nWell, it's more being consumed by flames.\n\n01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:46.180\nOh, it's right now.\n\n01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.180\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:48.180\nIt's on fire right now.\n\n01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:49.180\nYeah, and it's burning.\n\n01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:51.180\nOkay, so that's probably good, right?\n\n01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:52.180\nJar Jar, it's done.\n\n01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:53.180\nTo me!\n\n01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:54.180\nWow!\n\n01:31:54.180 --> 01:32:01.180\nAs the web starts to burn away, you can hear hisses deep within the webby mass.\n\n01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:06.180\nAt the same time, you see Breffi kind of fall to his knees like he's been hurt or something.\n\n01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.180\nUh-oh.\n\n01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:08.180\nBreffi doesn't want it.\n\n01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:10.180\nWhat are you, like a spider baby?\n\n01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:13.180\nHe's like, I'm Breffi!\n\n01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:16.180\nI'm Breffi!\n\n01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:17.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:18.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:19.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:21.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:22.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:23.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:24.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:25.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:26.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:27.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:29.180\nBreffi!\n\n01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:31.180\nI meant two episodes, Counting Treasure.\n\n01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:33.180\nI just wanted to move ahead.\n\n01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:35.180\nLook what's happening to Breffi!\n\n01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:37.180\nHe was just a nice, whole wanderer.\n\n01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:39.180\nListen to the last episode.\n\n01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:41.180\nHe just, all he did was hang out.\n\n01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:42.180\nOh my God!\n\n01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:46.180\nThis is like you hurling fire, and then they have to go to the madrasas to fight us back.\n\n01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:48.180\nGo ahead.\n\n01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:51.180\nToo lofty.\n\n01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:57.180\nYou see points raise up out of his shoulder blades as they elongate and stretch, and then\n\n01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:01.180\npierce out of his back, forming spider-like legs.\n\n01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:07.180\nThey elongate, and he grows and, you know, grows in size onto his newly formed legs,\n\n01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:14.180\nand is transformed into a hybrid humanoid spider form with clacking mandibles and sharp claws.\n\n01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:16.180\nAnd he's like, wait and go, butthead!\n\n01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:21.180\nMaybe it's not too late to make a friendship with the spider people.\n\n01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:26.180\nHey, have you heard Lady in Red?\n\n01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:28.180\nDo you like that song?\n\n01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:31.180\nHe makes some sort of utterance, but it's no longer English.\n\n01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:34.180\nIt's more of like a hissing, clacking sort of.\n\n01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:37.180\nIf it's or do, I got a shot at it.\n\n01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:41.180\nAlright, I'm going to be the first to admit I made a mistake.\n\n01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:42.180\nNo, you weren't first.\n\n01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:45.180\nWe said it before you said it.\n\n01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:49.180\nYes, you're the first to agree.\n\n01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:50.180\nNo, I said it.\n\n01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.180\nYou agree.\n\n01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:52.180\nOkay.\n\n01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:57.180\nHow do you think you're third to this party?\n\n01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:59.180\nMaybe you'll still be friendly.\n\n01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:02.180\nI'm going to assume that this brefi now means us some harm.\n\n01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:06.180\nI don't want to play the blame game.\n\n01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:07.180\nBecause you'll lose.\n\n01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:14.180\nYeah, you want to play the flame game.\n\n01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:16.180\nI try and reason with brefi.\n\n01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:20.180\nYou have a minus six against righteous indignation right now.\n\n01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:22.180\nSo what's your reason attempt?\n\n01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:27.180\nHey, brefi, sorry.\n\n01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:28.180\nNo, don't.\n\n01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:32.180\nI got one more attempt at it.\n\n01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:39.180\nHey, brefi, our bad.\n\n01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:42.180\nDo you have diplomacy?\n\n01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:44.180\nYeah, I got diplomacy.\n\n01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:46.180\nHow many ranks do you have in diplomacy?\n\n01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.180\nEight, bro.\n\n01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:49.180\nOkay, eight ranks.\n\n01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:54.180\nHe calms down a little slight bit.\n\n01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:59.180\nAll right, Stephanie, guys, our bad worked.\n\n01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.180\nStephanie, it's your turn.\n\n01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:05.180\nCan I put on my hat of disguise and be his mother?\n\n01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:06.180\nWhose mother?\n\n01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:07.180\nThe spiders?\n\n01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:08.180\nYeah.\n\n01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:09.180\nYou don't know what she looks like.\n\n01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:10.180\nWould you like to approximate it?\n\n01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.180\nSure.\n\n01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:15.180\nNo, this sounds like a bad.\n\n01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.180\nYeah.\n\n01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.180\nNo, no.\n\n01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:20.180\nThis is going to be worse than the fireball.\n\n01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:27.180\nYou sort of look like the human form of brefi, but with long hair and womanly traits.\n\n01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:32.180\nBecause the hat of disguise can't replicate monsters.\n\n01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.180\nIt can only do humanoid shapes.\n\n01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:39.180\nThis guy looks like somebody had a good relationship with his parents.\n\n01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:41.180\nYou know, arachnids.\n\n01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:44.180\nThe home is where the heart is.\n\n01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:49.180\nSo Sharpie still has his mage armor spell active from the last session.\n\n01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:52.180\nYou managed to shrug off his blow.\n\n01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:57.180\nHe rears back with one of his spindly spider-like legs and stabs you directly in the chest.\n\n01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:03.180\nHowever, the force armor guarding your body shrugs it off and it glances off your body.\n\n01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:05.180\nI go like this.\n\n01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.180\nI'm cocky about it.\n\n01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:10.180\nDo you brush it off your shoulders like Kobe did before his injury?\n\n01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:13.180\nI don't know what that means, but yes.\n\n01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:17.180\nI do what Kobe did.\n\n01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:21.180\nYou rip your Achilles tendon, right?\n\n01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:23.180\nIs that what happened?\n\n01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:28.180\nAnd you cheat on your wife.\n\n01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:33.180\nInfidelity.\n\n01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:34.180\nIt's a long fly.\n\n01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:35.180\nIt's out of here.\n\n01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:36.180\nSpencer, another homework.\n\n01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:40.180\nAre you going to roll on the infidelity or?\n\n01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:41.180\nOh yeah, yeah.\n\n01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:47.180\nSee if there's going to be charges.\n\n01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:49.180\nNo, no.\n\n01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:50.180\nGo ahead.\n\n01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:52.180\nI think it's your turn.\n\n01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:53.180\nIt's still your turn.\n\n01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:56.180\nYou're now looking like a female-style brevi.\n\n01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:58.180\nIs he going to fall for it?\n\n01:36:58.180 --> 01:36:59.180\nI mean, no.\n\n01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.180\nNo.\n\n01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:01.180\nYeah.\n\n01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:02.180\nDamn.\n\n01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:03.180\nAll right.\n\n01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:06.180\nSo we're trying to befriend him now, yes?\n\n01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:08.180\nWe're going to try that.\n\n01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:11.180\nHe has attacked.\n\n01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:13.180\nThrow an attack, Mulrainee.\n\n01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:14.180\nAll right.\n\n01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:15.180\nFuck.\n\n01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:25.180\nI would like to shoot two arrows.\n\n01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:30.180\nNo new taxes.\n\n01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:31.180\nTwo arrows.\n\n01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:33.180\nI shoot two arrows.\n\n01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:38.180\nIt's a national.\n\n01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:42.180\nRemember for the next 25 minutes after she shoots two arrows, maybe back ribs are half\n\n01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:43.180\noff.\n\n01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:47.180\nIt's a two arrow discount.\n\n01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:49.180\nTwo arrows.\n\n01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:54.180\nOne of the arrows strikes truants, hits him directly in the shoulder.\n\n01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:56.180\nThe other flies astray.\n\n01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:58.180\nDid you say it strikes truant?\n\n01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:59.180\nTruant.\n\n01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:00.180\nTrue.\n\n01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.180\nInto his shoulder.\n\n01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:04.180\nInto the class.\n\n01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:06.180\nThe arrow strikes truant.\n\n01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:09.180\nIt goes to a fishing hole.\n\n01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.180\nLike Tom Sawyer, it blows up class.\n\n01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:15.180\nIt avoids the constable.\n\n01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.180\nAll right.\n\n01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:18.180\nBefriend them.\n\n01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:20.180\nOh, did I say how much damage that did?\n\n01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.180\nFour damage.\n\n01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:22.180\nSorry, everybody.\n\n01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:23.180\nNot much.\n\n01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:25.180\nSpiders have lots of eyes, right?\n\n01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:27.180\nSpiders, they got some eyes.\n\n01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:31.180\nThe dazzling lights, would that be extra effective on their multiple eyes?\n\n01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:32.180\nThe dazzling lights?\n\n01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.180\nDancing lights.\n\n01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:34.180\nDancing lights, no.\n\n01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:36.180\nYeah, no, the dancing lights would not.\n\n01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:39.180\nOh, dancing lights are just like kind of just for mood.\n\n01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:42.180\nIt's like, if you want to fuck the spider.\n\n01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:44.180\nI haven't ruled it out.\n\n01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:46.180\nYeah, it's like illusions.\n\n01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:51.180\nYou know, it's like, you're like, oh, I want to make it look like a smiley face is illusion.\n\n01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:52.180\nI don't know.\n\n01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:53.180\nIt's hard to explain.\n\n01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:54.180\nAll right.\n\n01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:57.180\nI take some more reins.\n\n01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:01.180\nI'm going to do a combo move here with the rope tracker.\n\n01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:04.180\nI'm going to tie my far sword.\n\n01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:06.180\nOh, no, I can't do that.\n\n01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.180\nYeah, your far sword is a technique.\n\n01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:08.180\nYeah, technique.\n\n01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:10.180\nYou know, okay, forget the rope thing.\n\n01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:14.180\nI'm going to take my far sword and swipe it underneath it and try to chop off its legs.\n\n01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.180\nOkay, so you can swipe at it.\n\n01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.180\nYou don't have cleave.\n\n01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:21.180\nYeah, you'll swipe at the legs, you know, the point being to try and like cripple them.\n\n01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:23.180\nYeah, I want to immobilize this motherfucker.\n\n01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:24.180\nAll right.\n\n01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:27.180\nIn immobilizing strike.\n\n01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:30.180\nOh, shit.\n\n01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:31.180\nThat's a critical hit.\n\n01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:33.180\nFuck yeah!\n\n01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:35.180\nDoes that mean you rolled 20?\n\n01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.180\nYeah, I rolled a 20.\n\n01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:37.180\nHe rolled a 20.\n\n01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.180\nCritical hit.\n\n01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:40.180\nFucking chopped off all of his legs.\n\n01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.180\nNo, no.\n\n01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:42.180\nOh.\n\n01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:44.180\nDon't get ahead of yourself.\n\n01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:46.180\nYou do chop off three of his legs.\n\n01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.180\nThree of eight?\n\n01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:51.180\nThree of his legs are cleft straight off of his body and fall to the floor.\n\n01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:55.180\nNo, if I attacked his head and I got a critical hit, would that have been it for this matter?\n\n01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:59.180\nNo, I mean it still does the same amount of damage which is...\n\n01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:01.180\nIt wouldn't have died.\n\n01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:02.180\nI'll catch you.\n\n01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:04.180\nAbout 7, 12, 24.\n\n01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:05.180\nSo you did 24 damage.\n\n01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.180\nI'm with you.\n\n01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:07.180\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:08.180\nWow.\n\n01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.180\nSo we got a hobbled spider.\n\n01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.180\nOh yeah.\n\n01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:13.180\nI'm assuming as I aimed at one side that we chopped off like the left side.\n\n01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:17.180\nSo let's just say you chopped off his left three legs.\n\n01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:20.180\nSo now he can only walk in ever decreasing circles in one direction.\n\n01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:23.180\nOr I mean you can hop around on like four feet or something.\n\n01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:24.180\nOkay.\n\n01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:25.180\nI don't know.\n\n01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.180\nWho knows, man?\n\n01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:27.180\nSpider physics?\n\n01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:33.180\nI would like to hear a list of monsters I could summon with summon monster three.\n\n01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:34.180\nOh shit.\n\n01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:36.180\nOh, darn it.\n\n01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.180\nThey're all going to say squid.\n\n01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.180\nThey all want squid.\n\n01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:42.180\nSquids are so great to summon you guys.\n\n01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:44.180\nThey just, they don't even drown it.\n\n01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:45.180\nIs it Keith?\n\n01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:46.180\nKeith?\n\n01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:47.180\nYeah, get a squid.\n\n01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:49.180\nA squid has, squids have multiple tentacles, man.\n\n01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:53.180\nThere's a bit, like it was so big, we were in the confines of a ship.\n\n01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:55.180\nYeah, that actually made a lot of sense then.\n\n01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:57.180\nIt was like summoning a rock, you know.\n\n01:40:57.180 --> 01:40:58.180\nIt's telling some guys.\n\n01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.180\nWhat a whale.\n\n01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:02.180\nThis is open melee, dude.\n\n01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:04.180\nDo what your heart says.\n\n01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:05.180\nI'm very interested.\n\n01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:08.180\nLast time he did that, he got us in deep shit.\n\n01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:09.180\nYeah, that's right.\n\n01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:11.180\nJust don't, well, but now he started it.\n\n01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:12.180\nSo whatever you gotta do.\n\n01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:14.180\nYeah, dude, you know what?\n\n01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:15.180\nRedemption time.\n\n01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:16.180\nWe are where we are.\n\n01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.180\nRedemption time, Sharpie.\n\n01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:20.180\nThanks, guys.\n\n01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:25.180\nCelestial Black Bear, Celestial Bison, Celestial Dire Badger, Celestial Hippogriff.\n\n01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:26.180\nElemental Small Any.\n\n01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:28.180\nSo that's any type of elemental fire.\n\n01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:29.180\nWhatever, next.\n\n01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:30.180\nOkay.\n\n01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:32.180\nFiendish Ape, Fiendish Dire Weasel.\n\n01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:34.180\nFiendish Ape, Fiendish Ape.\n\n01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:36.180\nHe's as tall as the sky.\n\n01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.180\nFiendish Ape.\n\n01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:40.180\nIs that, is that the guy that chases you in Temple Run 2?\n\n01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:41.180\nHave you guys played Temple Run 2?\n\n01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:43.180\nLet me, let me, let me just ask one thing though.\n\n01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:50.180\nOn the list of Summon Monster 3 Summonable Monsters, is there some kind of spider type\n\n01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:51.180\nmonster?\n\n01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:54.180\nI just, just in case we get to see it.\n\n01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.180\nYou know?\n\n01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.180\nYeah.\n\n01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:59.180\nThe tension is palpable.\n\n01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:01.180\nNo, I'm not seeing it.\n\n01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:03.180\nFiendish Ape.\n\n01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:05.180\nApe that shit, bro.\n\n01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:07.180\nCasting your arms in a magical manner.\n\n01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:10.180\nOof, oof, ah, Agnamon.\n\n01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:16.180\nAn ape, rather fiendish in appearance, leaps into being, and throws himself upon the,\n\n01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:18.180\nthe spider-like creature.\n\n01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:20.180\nSpider-um, terminate-um!\n\n01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:21.180\nBraffy.\n\n01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:23.180\nUh, yeah.\n\n01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:24.180\nOkay.\n\n01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.180\nThe, the, the, what's it called?\n\n01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.180\nThe Fiendish Ape, right?\n\n01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:28.180\nFiendish, yeah, that's what it's called.\n\n01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:29.180\nFuck everything.\n\n01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:35.180\nThe Fiendish Ape leaps upon the spider dude that I mentioned earlier, and begins immediately\n\n01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:39.180\npummeling him with his fists, his big broad ape-like fists.\n\n01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:40.180\nYeah.\n\n01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:41.180\nHis sensual.\n\n01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:45.180\nDo you think there was a non-conflict resolution to this?\n\n01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:46.180\nYeah.\n\n01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:49.180\nYou fucked that when you threw a fireball at it.\n\n01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:50.180\nYou guys want spoilers?\n\n01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:51.180\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:52.180\nOkay.\n\n01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:55.180\nWell, I mean, it will actually, it didn't, it's not going to come to fruition, like.\n\n01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:57.180\nOkay, tell us what could have happened.\n\n01:42:57.180 --> 01:43:01.180\nHe's a spider dude, but if he didn't kill the spiders, he would have just been all like,\n\n01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:03.180\nI'm a spider dude, I'm going to help these dudes out.\n\n01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:06.180\nBut he killed his spider, so it's like, fuck you!\n\n01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:08.180\nSo it's completely Sharpie's fault.\n\n01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:09.180\nYeah, definitely.\n\n01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:11.180\nDude, he told you.\n\n01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:15.180\nOr, no, I mean, I mean, he might have jumped on you guys anyway as an amateur.\n\n01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.180\nYeah.\n\n01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:18.180\nWhat do you, you're not hearing the same things he's saying.\n\n01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:20.180\nI saved the world.\n\n01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:22.180\nDealing six damage.\n\n01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:24.180\nSix damage, bro.\n\n01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:26.180\nSix world-saving damage.\n\n01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:27.180\nI support you, sure.\n\n01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:29.180\nOkay, is it, is it my turn now?\n\n01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:30.180\nYeah.\n\n01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:35.180\nUh, misreading the situation, I still try and reason with it.\n\n01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:39.180\nListen, a lot of mistakes were made today.\n\n01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:41.180\nDude, I'm on your side.\n\n01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:45.180\nDo you have, do you have, uh, Intimidate or just Diplomacy?\n\n01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:46.180\nI realize-\n\n01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:49.180\nDude, do you have total denial?\n\n01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:51.180\nUh, it's not under-\n\n01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:53.180\nDo you have psychosis?\n\n01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:54.180\nWhat level of psychosis do you have?\n\n01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:55.180\nIs that under peace?\n\n01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:57.180\nNo, then I don't have it.\n\n01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:58.180\nIt would be under-\n\n01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:01.180\nUm, all right, listen, I know we chopped off three of your legs and then\n\n01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:04.180\nsent a fiendish ape to punch you in the face.\n\n01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:08.180\nWe've met almost none of it.\n\n01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:12.180\nHey, are we cool?\n\n01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:13.180\nIt's like-\n\n01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:15.180\nAre we cool?\n\n01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:16.180\nBrefi, right?\n\n01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:17.180\nAm I saying that right?\n\n01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:21.180\nYour words seem to have, have a swaying effect on him.\n\n01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:24.180\nHe looks down at the ground and at all of his bleeding stumps\n\n01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:26.180\nand realizes he can't win this combat.\n\n01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:27.180\nOh!\n\n01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:31.180\nAll right, well then I, I weirdly, I take my cloak\n\n01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:33.180\nand I try and bandage one of his legs.\n\n01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:36.180\nBut you guys might have healing potions if you're down to heal him.\n\n01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:39.180\nI, I healed the spider.\n\n01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:41.180\nIs that a good idea or a bad idea?\n\n01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:43.180\nDo you have healing potions?\n\n01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:46.180\nHey, can I borrow some healing potions?\n\n01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:50.180\nI've got one left and I just, I just chopped three of his legs up.\n\n01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:51.180\nWe gotta use it.\n\n01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:52.180\nListen, I know this is a weird idea.\n\n01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:54.180\nHe's kind of successfully good-copping them, though.\n\n01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:55.180\nThis might work.\n\n01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:56.180\nOkay, all right, okay.\n\n01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:59.180\nAll right, uh, Christopher, I, I, uh-\n\n01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:01.180\nI just, you know what I do, I don't try and bandage it,\n\n01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:05.180\nbut I, like, try and engage it while, uh, Malred's gonna attack it, okay?\n\n01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:07.180\nSo I'm gonna be like, so, like, what?\n\n01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:09.180\nLike, your deal, like-\n\n01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:14.180\nMy whole last three generations were just wiped out.\n\n01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:19.180\nAll right, um, I don't think I have any legs to stand on, so...\n\n01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:21.180\nBut I did a sh- sh- sh- sh-\n\n01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:22.180\nNo, I was not-\n\n01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:23.180\nLook at that!\n\n01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:24.180\nDamn it!\n\n01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:25.180\nI was not trying to-\n\n01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:27.180\nToo soon!\n\n01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.180\nToo soon!\n\n01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:31.180\nOh, God, a bad choice of words!\n\n01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:32.180\nI just, uh...\n\n01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:34.180\nI wish it was a crazy white guy instead.\n\n01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:36.180\nNo.\n\n01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:40.180\nAll right, I step back and, uh...\n\n01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:41.180\nMalred?\n\n01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:43.180\nWait, so wait, did you use my healing potion or not?\n\n01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:44.180\nI didn't hear it being used.\n\n01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:45.180\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:46.180\nNo, I gave it back and I said,\n\n01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:48.180\nWe gotta kill this guy!\n\n01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:51.180\nHey, we're on your side, bro.\n\n01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:54.180\nI go up to one of his spider legs and I go,\n\n01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:59.180\nOh, no, I don't have anything, but I just wanted to know that-\n\n01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:00.180\nYou're taunting him.\n\n01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:02.180\nWell, uh, I'm not taunting him.\n\n01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:03.180\nNo, he's trying to-\n\n01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:04.180\nI give him some skittles.\n\n01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:05.180\nKill him lowly!\n\n01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:07.180\nA lot of times, like, like, like, like,\n\n01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:09.180\nlike, shock is what'll kill you.\n\n01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:10.180\nIf people think that it's no big-\n\n01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:13.180\nI say, you know, I had a spider brother,\n\n01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:17.180\nthis same thing happened to him, and he's fine.\n\n01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:19.180\nThe same thing that happened to him is that you killed\n\n01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:22.180\nthree generations of his babies.\n\n01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:24.180\nObviously, some mistakes have been made.\n\n01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:28.180\nI pull Mulraine aside, knowing it's her turn next,\n\n01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:30.180\nand I go, look, I'm a barbarian.\n\n01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:31.180\nLet's kill this piece of shit.\n\n01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:32.180\nFuck yeah.\n\n01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:33.180\nYeah.\n\n01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:35.180\nYou're a lie false flat, Sharpie.\n\n01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:36.180\nWait, I don't like you, no, never mind.\n\n01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.180\nYou don't like me?\n\n01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:38.180\nNo, but I do like you.\n\n01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:39.180\nYeah, we like you.\n\n01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:40.180\nSorry, I was kidding.\n\n01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:41.180\nYou're a lie false flat.\n\n01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:42.180\nIt doesn't work.\n\n01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:43.180\nWell, Mulraine-\n\n01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:44.180\nHe's not buying it.\n\n01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:45.180\nWell, I feel bad.\n\n01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:48.180\nI feel, I mean, I, look, Mulraine,\n\n01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:50.180\ndo you have anything that can-\n\n01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:51.180\nWhat is-\n\n01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.180\nWe got him on the ropes, I mean.\n\n01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.180\nMaybe he could-\n\n01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:56.180\nI have sleep arrows.\n\n01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:58.180\nCan at least knock him out.\n\n01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:03.180\nIt's like in, you know, what was it, thin red line.\n\n01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.180\nYou know, just give him a lot of sleep arrows\n\n01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:07.180\nand like a little drift off.\n\n01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:10.180\nI don't know how to kill animals.\n\n01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:11.180\nCan we have a little power on,\n\n01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:13.180\ndecide exactly what we want out of this?\n\n01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:15.180\nOh yeah, she's from a no kill shelter.\n\n01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:18.180\nShe's the wrong person, dude.\n\n01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:21.180\nWhy don't you just steal some money from the spider?\n\n01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:23.180\nWhat if I could?\n\n01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:25.180\nAnd then we'll be okay.\n\n01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:26.180\nAlright, let's just kill him.\n\n01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:28.180\nWhat are, what are, what are merciful arrows?\n\n01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:30.180\nMerciful arrows deal extra damage,\n\n01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:33.180\nbut they only deal non-lethal damage.\n\n01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.180\nSo you can, if you're trying to knock people out,\n\n01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:39.180\nyou can stab them full of merciful arrows, no problem.\n\n01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:40.180\nBut yeah, they won't die.\n\n01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:41.180\nI have a bedroll.\n\n01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:44.180\nI'd like to wrap it around the spider's head.\n\n01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:46.180\nWhat?\n\n01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:47.180\nYeah.\n\n01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:48.180\nJust drape it over.\n\n01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:50.180\nThat's a successful throwback.\n\n01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:53.180\nThat's like a critical hit on throwback.\n\n01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:54.180\nOkay.\n\n01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:57.180\nAnd they go shh, shh, shh, shh.\n\n01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.180\nI start singing to it.\n\n01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:00.180\nTo lull it to sleep.\n\n01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:01.180\nWhat do you sing?\n\n01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:03.180\nYeah, you know what I sing.\n\n01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:05.180\nI'd like to hear it.\n\n01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:09.180\nHit it more right.\n\n01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:12.180\nAlright, I would like to shoot\n\n01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:15.180\none sleep arrow.\n\n01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:16.180\nAlright.\n\n01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:19.180\nLoosing a sleep arrow from your bow.\n\n01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:21.180\nYou strike him directly in the face.\n\n01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:24.180\nLady and Red!\n\n01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:27.180\nHe loses consciousness to the dulcet tones\n\n01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:30.180\nof Christopher's sweet, sweet voice.\n\n01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:32.180\nI put a giant glass over it\n\n01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:38.180\nand then slide a huge 60-foot piece of cardboard\n\n01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:40.180\nunder the glass.\n\n01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.180\nI would almost never suggest this,\n\n01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:43.180\nbut I suggest quark.\n\n01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:45.180\nIf you want to fuck something,\n\n01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:47.180\nnow's the time to do it.\n\n01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:49.180\nYou want a story for your friends.\n\n01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:50.180\nOkay.\n\n01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:52.180\nUnder one condition.\n\n01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:54.180\nSomebody takes a photo of it.\n\n01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:56.180\nI lift up the glass\n\n01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:58.180\nand I get inside the glass\n\n01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:02.180\nwith the sleeping mutilated spider.\n\n01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:05.180\nWhat's the D&D equivalent of a photo?\n\n01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:10.180\nAs
