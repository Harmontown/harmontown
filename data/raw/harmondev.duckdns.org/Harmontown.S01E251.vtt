{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:20.680\nFor a beautiful uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:20.680 --> 00:28.100\nSpencer Crittenden then.\n\n00:28.100 --> 00:43.100\nHe's a man with a plaid pillow because he probably has hemorrhoids at the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:43.100 --> 00:50.100\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you for coming out. Happy summer. Happy Burbank to you.\n\n00:50.100 --> 00:54.100\nDo you need a better chair? We could get you a chair.\n\n00:54.100 --> 00:59.100\nEventually, sure. Let's put that on a vision board.\n\n00:59.100 --> 01:02.100\nAre you getting sore buns over there on your plastic chair?\n\n01:02.100 --> 01:10.100\nI have in the past. I figured it out. You know, these plaid pillows, we got them from Harmon Quest Season 2 tapings.\n\n01:10.100 --> 01:18.100\nThey were bought as mostly, I think, a joke by the people who furnished the green rooms.\n\n01:18.100 --> 01:23.100\nAnd then they just gave them to me afterwards because they only bought them as a joke.\n\n01:23.100 --> 01:27.100\nSo you're mad that they came out of the budget for your show?\n\n01:27.100 --> 01:34.100\nYeah, it's really wasteful in my opinion. No, no, it was great, but it's just great that I really can use it.\n\n01:34.100 --> 01:39.100\nBecause it's like, you know, and then I was like, great, now I have these pillows. I don't really have anywhere to put them.\n\n01:39.100 --> 01:42.100\nWhy not put them on my ass?\n\n01:42.100 --> 01:48.100\nIn the 80s, especially in animation, there was a heavy tradition of characters that could turn into other things.\n\n01:48.100 --> 01:55.100\nAnd then they would keep their motif if they turned into something like plastic man could turn into anything,\n\n01:55.100 --> 02:02.100\nbut he always had this belt and a little outfit that would be stretched around the middle of the car.\n\n02:02.100 --> 02:09.100\nAnd there was Rubik the Amazing Cube who could turn into things, but he always had this weird blue decaying ET head.\n\n02:09.100 --> 02:14.100\nBecause someone said, well, it's just a Rubik's Cube. We have to make it adorable.\n\n02:14.100 --> 02:21.100\nAnd they put this fucking weird ET head on it, like mistaking just any alien head for a cube.\n\n02:21.100 --> 02:25.100\nAnd it was really disturbing and not at all Rubik-oriented.\n\n02:25.100 --> 02:30.100\nReally drifted from Rubik's original vision.\n\n02:30.100 --> 02:35.100\nPeople only know him for his cube, but he saw a world of order.\n\n02:35.100 --> 02:41.100\nHe never intended people to mess those things up. He was racist.\n\n02:41.100 --> 02:45.100\nRubik's Cube was all white.\n\n02:45.100 --> 02:53.100\nBut he married a wonderful Latina lady, and as a result he became a little less racist\n\n02:53.100 --> 03:00.100\nand that he was like, let's make this cube six different colors, but still so into the separation of them.\n\n03:00.100 --> 03:03.100\nHe credited himself with being more open-minded.\n\n03:03.100 --> 03:07.100\nThe goal is to separate all the races.\n\n03:07.100 --> 03:13.100\nAnd that was the slogan at the end of the commercials. He would pop up at the bottom of the screen and go,\n\n03:13.100 --> 03:18.100\ndon't forget to separate all the races.\n\n03:18.100 --> 03:23.100\nIt's a separate but equal exclamation point on the box.\n\n03:23.100 --> 03:28.100\nHe just thought he wasn't racist because that's what white people are good at.\n\n03:28.100 --> 03:33.100\nThey're good at fooling themselves into thinking that all kinds of racism is not racist.\n\n03:33.100 --> 03:37.100\nIt's in our blood. We were good at it.\n\n03:37.100 --> 03:40.100\nThat's also Harmontown's motto, I think.\n\n03:40.100 --> 03:44.100\nSeparate those races.\n\n03:44.100 --> 03:48.100\nThe point that you were going at is that Spencer brings on a plaid pillow.\n\n03:48.100 --> 03:50.100\nThat's what he turns into.\n\n03:50.100 --> 03:53.100\nIf Spencer turned into a pillow, that's what it would look like.\n\n03:53.100 --> 03:56.100\nIt would be this plaid pillow and have glasses and a beard on it.\n\n03:56.100 --> 03:58.100\nThat would be so good.\n\n03:58.100 --> 04:04.100\nIt would be great if we were like the super friends and we were just hanging out and turning into pillows and stuff.\n\n04:04.100 --> 04:09.100\nOh, it would be like Steven Universe.\n\n04:09.100 --> 04:16.100\nDan, you would turn into an Adderall.\n\n04:16.100 --> 04:24.100\nI didn't know this bit was an opportunity to take shots at each other.\n\n04:24.100 --> 04:28.100\nYou would turn into an old-timey typewriter, I think.\n\n04:28.100 --> 04:32.100\nYou'd be like a little typewriter on wheels.\n\n04:32.100 --> 04:35.100\nWe're talking about characters that can turn into anything.\n\n04:35.100 --> 04:39.100\nThat's why they have to retain those physical characteristics.\n\n04:39.100 --> 04:41.100\nThe super friends is another one.\n\n04:41.100 --> 04:45.100\nThey would say Wonder Twin powers activate and then one of them could turn into any animal\n\n04:45.100 --> 04:50.100\nand one of them could turn into any kind of thing that involved water, which included ice.\n\n04:50.100 --> 04:53.100\nAnd a bucket to hold the water.\n\n04:53.100 --> 04:57.100\nWait, I can turn into other things besides water.\n\n04:57.100 --> 05:06.100\nAt one point he turned into an ice giant and it was like, all right, wait a minute.\n\n05:06.100 --> 05:08.100\nI was like, why don't you turn into Ice Superman?\n\n05:08.100 --> 05:12.100\nI can't remember if he did that or if that was in my just bitchings about it.\n\n05:12.100 --> 05:17.100\nIce giant? What does he have? Ice arteries and ice heart?\n\n05:17.100 --> 05:21.100\nIce is just anything, then fuck you.\n\n05:21.100 --> 05:26.100\nI think he was like a form of a nice helicopter.\n\n05:26.100 --> 05:27.100\nIt's silly.\n\n05:27.100 --> 05:29.100\nThere's moving parts. Just stop it.\n\n05:29.100 --> 05:32.100\nWhere is the verisimilitude, Wonder Twins?\n\n05:32.100 --> 05:35.100\nThat's my question.\n\n05:35.100 --> 05:38.100\nI know we've talked about this before, because whenever Super Friends comes up,\n\n05:38.100 --> 05:43.100\nthe thing that I think is so funny is that there was obviously a push for diversity,\n\n05:43.100 --> 05:49.100\n70s style from that cartoon, and they added this guy who I can't remember the superhero's name.\n\n05:49.100 --> 05:52.100\nIs it El Diablo or El Dorado?\n\n05:52.100 --> 05:58.100\nHe was a Latino gentleman, but I never saw him in the cartoon.\n\n05:58.100 --> 06:05.100\nThey just had him in the title sequence to just like, maybe there was like protests happening outside of the Super Friends building\n\n06:05.100 --> 06:09.100\nwhere they draw the cartoon and they're just like, shut up.\n\n06:09.100 --> 06:11.100\nHis name is El Dorado.\n\n06:11.100 --> 06:14.100\nCaesar Chavez is holding great protest right now on the streets.\n\n06:14.100 --> 06:16.100\nWe've got to get some Mexicans on this.\n\n06:16.100 --> 06:24.100\nIn the title sequence, El Dorado has a medallion, and he's like a handsome kind of darkly-complected man,\n\n06:24.100 --> 06:31.100\nand he just has this red cape, and he just whips it over his face and disappears.\n\n06:31.100 --> 06:35.100\nYou never see him in the show.\n\n06:35.100 --> 06:38.100\nThat was the diversity push.\n\n06:38.100 --> 06:40.100\nHe's invisible, but he's always there.\n\n06:40.100 --> 06:47.100\nHe supports the Super Friends community with his, he works for Lassim.\n\n06:47.100 --> 06:53.100\nThere was that time when the Wondertons were walking down a beach and there was six set of footprints.\n\n06:53.100 --> 07:00.100\nThat's how you know when your unfairly paid labor force was carrying you.\n\n07:00.100 --> 07:06.100\nAll the while sending money home, and boy.\n\n07:06.100 --> 07:13.100\nI'm just saying, I'm a Californian. I know better than the rest of the country this concept\n\n07:13.100 --> 07:20.100\nthat my heart bleeds for our wonderful friends from down south.\n\n07:20.100 --> 07:25.100\nIt must be a terrifying time for them. What a great show.\n\n07:25.100 --> 07:28.100\nWe're experiencing that thing right now. They're fucking with journalists,\n\n07:28.100 --> 07:33.100\nand of course they started with immigrants.\n\n07:33.100 --> 07:36.100\nI know it's cliche, but it's like, come on, you're next.\n\n07:36.100 --> 07:39.100\nIt doesn't matter how white you are, it doesn't matter, you're next, you're next.\n\n07:39.100 --> 07:44.100\nYou're either going to put on the jumpsuit and get into the honeycomb in the Mars base,\n\n07:44.100 --> 07:48.100\nor you're going to be, I mean, there's not, I don't know what people keep thinking.\n\n07:48.100 --> 07:56.100\nThey keep thinking, oh, if we just are polite enough, if we just adhere to our own rules\n\n07:56.100 --> 08:01.100\nof what makes good people enough, this is going to blow over.\n\n08:01.100 --> 08:06.100\nI don't know, man. It's like, it's hard to say these words,\n\n08:06.100 --> 08:12.100\nbut it's just not going to stop until, and then you have to stop talking\n\n08:12.100 --> 08:15.100\nbecause then you're, what are you encouraging? I don't know.\n\n08:15.100 --> 08:18.100\nWe all have to just sit cross-legged in the street and just eat Twinkies\n\n08:18.100 --> 08:21.100\nuntil the world stops turning or something.\n\n08:21.100 --> 08:26.100\nI don't know, they can't put all of us in prison. I don't know what to do.\n\n08:26.100 --> 08:31.100\nI put the guest here and there that they could come in and maybe they could give us some guidance and stuff,\n\n08:31.100 --> 08:36.100\nbut you know, that one guy, whoever you are, I don't know where you tweeted or whatever,\n\n08:36.100 --> 08:40.100\noh, I wish I missed the days when the show could go for an hour without talking about Trump.\n\n08:40.100 --> 08:43.100\nWell, why don't you suck my dick?\n\n08:43.100 --> 08:50.100\nAgain, it's like, what, and then the people on the Instagram,\n\n08:50.100 --> 08:54.100\nlike, I have my iPad, I play with my photo app.\n\n08:54.100 --> 08:57.100\nHe's the most famous guy in the world. He's on everyone's mind.\n\n08:57.100 --> 09:00.100\nI'm going to fuck with his face and put it on a hot dog or something.\n\n09:00.100 --> 09:03.100\nIt's not a fucking meme. I just think these 15-year-olds going like,\n\n09:03.100 --> 09:07.100\ndude, your meme game is weak. You're the losing side of a meme war.\n\n09:07.100 --> 09:09.100\nMotherfucker, it's called photography.\n\n09:09.100 --> 09:13.100\nSo what are these people that just came into our world like larva\n\n09:13.100 --> 09:16.100\nand they just like think that every, they're just like these horrible animal people,\n\n09:16.100 --> 09:21.100\nterrible, just dumb people, just awful people with brains the size of capers.\n\n09:21.100 --> 09:27.100\nThey're just like, just bad, bad people and you can't humanize them anymore.\n\n09:27.100 --> 09:29.100\nAnd I know you're not supposed to side with the split.\n\n09:29.100 --> 09:32.100\nYou're supposed to like, we're supposed to be the good guys.\n\n09:32.100 --> 09:35.100\nWe're supposed to believe, but it's just, no, you're a fucking dumbass.\n\n09:35.100 --> 09:40.100\nYou're a terrible, and you make up apparently at least enough of the country,\n\n09:40.100 --> 09:45.100\njust barely enough of the country that, yeah, now this is all with your liberal tier mugs\n\n09:45.100 --> 09:48.100\nand I just like, go fuck yourself.\n\n09:48.100 --> 09:54.100\nAnd I was going to buy a Tesla. I was this close to retirement.\n\n09:54.100 --> 09:59.100\nI was in the zone. I was fucking sliding through, man.\n\n09:59.100 --> 10:01.100\nAnd they pulled you back in.\n\n10:01.100 --> 10:03.100\nIt's just that, you know, everything's going to pay less.\n\n10:03.100 --> 10:05.100\nYou know, I'm going to get blacklisted.\n\n10:05.100 --> 10:08.100\nYou know, I'm like four years and people are going to be like having hearings\n\n10:08.100 --> 10:13.100\nor like, Mr. Harmon, do you ever consult with Mexicans?\n\n10:13.100 --> 10:18.100\nYou know, I'm like, yeah, yeah, I probably do. I have that honor.\n\n10:18.100 --> 10:22.100\nI have that honor and they'll drag me away.\n\n10:22.100 --> 10:27.100\nI love my housekeeper. I love my housekeeper.\n\n10:27.100 --> 10:34.100\nI give her children my clothes.\n\n10:34.100 --> 10:35.100\nIsn't she El Salvador?\n\n10:35.100 --> 10:37.100\nWe invited her to my wedding.\n\n10:37.100 --> 10:42.100\nShe looked at me weird when I did, but I did.\n\n10:42.100 --> 10:44.100\nYou invited her to the wedding?\n\n10:44.100 --> 10:50.100\nErin did.\n\n10:50.100 --> 10:54.100\nI can't talk to her. I can't talk to her.\n\n10:54.100 --> 10:59.100\nDan can't talk to her, which is great because I could talk to her.\n\n10:59.100 --> 11:00.100\nShe's fine.\n\n11:00.100 --> 11:01.100\nYeah, she's the best.\n\n11:01.100 --> 11:04.100\nWe have the same housekeeper, Sophia, and she's the fucking, she's my diver.\n\n11:04.100 --> 11:05.100\nShe fixes everything.\n\n11:05.100 --> 11:06.100\nYeah, she's great.\n\n11:06.100 --> 11:07.100\nShe's really good.\n\n11:07.100 --> 11:09.100\nI just, I can't, I can't, I get scared talking to her.\n\n11:09.100 --> 11:12.100\nIt's not easy to talk to her, but it is quite possible.\n\n11:12.100 --> 11:16.100\nI told you what, because Dan, I mean, she speaks, she speaks very good English,\n\n11:16.100 --> 11:18.100\nbut it's obviously not her first language.\n\n11:18.100 --> 11:22.100\nBut she's a super badass hardworking.\n\n11:22.100 --> 11:25.100\nI told you the time about Harvey when she came over and talked about Harvey,\n\n11:25.100 --> 11:27.100\nwhen she first started working for you.\n\n11:27.100 --> 11:28.100\nOh, yeah.\n\n11:28.100 --> 11:29.100\nShe's on the trash, yeah.\n\n11:29.100 --> 11:36.100\nI, so look, I can't talk, people who talk quietly, people who, like,\n\n11:36.100 --> 11:40.100\nI am the guy who in every conversation is always going,\n\n11:40.100 --> 11:41.100\nWhat?\n\n11:41.100 --> 11:42.100\nWhat?\n\n11:42.100 --> 11:43.100\nWhat?\n\n11:43.100 --> 11:45.100\nAnd, like, the fifth time you say what, you feel like a dick.\n\n11:45.100 --> 11:49.100\nLike, so, then I just, like, and I'm just, like, really riddled with social anxiety.\n\n11:49.100 --> 11:55.100\nLike, I've made up my mind at some point, I guess, and go ahead and laugh it up when\n\n11:55.100 --> 11:59.100\nI say this, that I could get through this life without offending anyone.\n\n11:59.100 --> 12:01.100\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n12:01.100 --> 12:07.100\nAnd it's like, you're Dan Harmon, you're like a pariah, you only offend people.\n\n12:07.100 --> 12:10.100\nBut that's not, I'm not trying, that's the difference.\n\n12:10.100 --> 12:12.100\nLike, I'm not trying not to.\n\n12:12.100 --> 12:14.100\nAnd then I'm like, I just put my foot in my mouth or whatever.\n\n12:14.100 --> 12:17.100\nAnd I was like, I just, I just, I'm just riddled, I'm riddled with social anxiety.\n\n12:17.100 --> 12:19.100\nI just don't want to be the bad guy.\n\n12:19.100 --> 12:20.100\nI don't want to say no to people.\n\n12:20.100 --> 12:23.100\nI don't want to, you know, that's why after the show, I just run out and I get,\n\n12:23.100 --> 12:27.100\nI get into a jet ski and I just, I just, and then I'm like, there's no water, there's no water!\n\n12:27.100 --> 12:34.100\nBecause I don't want to, I don't want to, because I don't want to tell the third person\n\n12:34.100 --> 12:37.100\nthat wants to get a photo after the show, after a talk for two hours, I don't want,\n\n12:37.100 --> 12:38.100\nwhat do you say no?\n\n12:38.100 --> 12:39.100\nWhat do you say no to somebody?\n\n12:39.100 --> 12:40.100\nThat's crazy.\n\n12:40.100 --> 12:41.100\nYou don't say no.\n\n12:41.100 --> 12:46.100\nSo instead I did this rude behavior where I just fucking, I just throw down ninja balls\n\n12:46.100 --> 12:53.100\nand ninja testicles are, when they hit the floor, they emit a sound.\n\n12:53.100 --> 12:57.100\nIt's the, it's the, it's the sound of the, of the ninja's heart dying.\n\n12:57.100 --> 13:01.100\nAnd it's so spiritually distracting that you don't notice someone running away.\n\n13:01.100 --> 13:04.100\nIn the movies, they characterize it as smoke.\n\n13:04.100 --> 13:09.100\nBut now people know if they want to get, get to you after the show,\n\n13:09.100 --> 13:11.100\nor just hang out by the jet ski that's out front.\n\n13:11.100 --> 13:13.100\nYeah, well I always put it in a different place.\n\n13:13.100 --> 13:17.100\nAnd don't try listening for the engine, because it's solar powered.\n\n13:17.100 --> 13:20.100\nIt's a Tesla jet ski.\n\n13:20.100 --> 13:25.100\nIt's a Tetski.\n\n13:25.100 --> 13:27.100\nIt's a Tetski.\n\n13:27.100 --> 13:29.100\nYou saw Mr. Musk tweeting about it.\n\n13:29.100 --> 13:31.100\nThey're here just for a select few.\n\n13:31.100 --> 13:32.100\nI'm part of a weight glove program.\n\n13:32.100 --> 13:33.100\nI'm checking it out.\n\n13:33.100 --> 13:35.100\nIt's a Tetski.\n\n13:35.100 --> 13:38.100\nSo you've decided against getting the Tesla now?\n\n13:38.100 --> 13:39.100\nYeah, I just got a Tetski.\n\n13:39.100 --> 13:40.100\nYou got a Tetski.\n\n13:40.100 --> 13:43.100\nNo, I can't, oh look, I got my money.\n\n13:43.100 --> 13:44.100\nI'm not, I'm not a liquid man.\n\n13:44.100 --> 13:45.100\nOkay.\n\n13:45.100 --> 13:47.100\nUnlike one of the Wonder Twins.\n\n13:47.100 --> 13:48.100\nRight.\n\n13:48.100 --> 13:53.100\nLike, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I definitely, you know, money comes into the Harmon Empire.\n\n13:53.100 --> 13:59.100\nAnd I definitely like, I put it back out into the fields, you know, like I plant more seeds.\n\n13:59.100 --> 14:02.100\nI go like, oh, let's, let's meet with these people.\n\n14:02.100 --> 14:04.100\nAnd let's, let's do this out of pocket.\n\n14:04.100 --> 14:06.100\nLet's, let's start this or that.\n\n14:06.100 --> 14:07.100\nI don't know.\n\n14:07.100 --> 14:09.100\nIt's just kind of like, but moreover, it's not about me being philanthropical.\n\n14:09.100 --> 14:16.100\nIt's about me like, instead of taking jobs that pay, I kind of tell, well, why don't I do this project that's kind of will pay off later.\n\n14:16.100 --> 14:21.100\nSo I am kind of largely what you, a rich person would call broke.\n\n14:21.100 --> 14:30.100\nI don't really look at the actual bank statements, but I just, you can see Levy's, like the blood leaves his face.\n\n14:30.100 --> 14:31.100\nHe's like a thermometer.\n\n14:31.100 --> 14:33.100\nLike, like, like he looks at it.\n\n14:33.100 --> 14:34.100\nAnd then I'm like, how are you doing?\n\n14:34.100 --> 14:35.100\nWhat's going on?\n\n14:35.100 --> 14:36.100\nPretty good.\n\n14:36.100 --> 14:45.100\nSounds like, sounds like I'm down to 40 grand, better, better get that, better turn in one of these treatments.\n\n14:45.100 --> 14:50.100\nI learned how to write this weekend.\n\n14:50.100 --> 14:52.100\nFucking finally.\n\n14:52.100 --> 14:55.100\nThat's good news.\n\n14:55.100 --> 15:06.100\nI mean, I really, I was like, because I, you go into therapy and, and, and, and, you know, I, look, I, I've said in the past have been like, can you please help me?\n\n15:06.100 --> 15:09.100\nI don't know why I sometimes write very slowly.\n\n15:09.100 --> 15:14.100\nAnd, and, and, you know, it was like, well, like, like for a while.\n\n15:14.100 --> 15:16.100\nI was like, you know, just breathe.\n\n15:16.100 --> 15:18.100\nAnd I was like, okay, I'm breathing.\n\n15:18.100 --> 15:24.100\nAnd then, and then like, just like, I'll take you through a meditation and just, you know, is God a part of your writing?\n\n15:24.100 --> 15:36.100\nAnd I'm like, I'm like, yeah, I mean, he is, but, or she, but it's like, like, like, well, and, and she's like, well, just say to God, like, you take care of the quality.\n\n15:36.100 --> 15:38.100\nI'll take care of the quantity.\n\n15:38.100 --> 15:40.100\nAnd I was like, oh, okay, that's good.\n\n15:40.100 --> 15:42.100\nAnd then, and then I was like, yeah, take care of the quality.\n\n15:42.100 --> 15:43.100\nI'll take care of the kind.\n\n15:43.100 --> 15:49.100\nAnd I was like, well, that's just, you're just saying what everyone keeps saying to me, which is right faster.\n\n15:49.100 --> 15:57.100\nYou just threw God under the bus and just like, so then I didn't bring it up for a couple of weeks, but then I went in because I was like really jammed up on this treatment.\n\n15:57.100 --> 15:59.100\nAnd I was just like, it was just torture.\n\n15:59.100 --> 16:12.100\nIt was like, I have these like modes of operation where you've seen if you've, if you're a fan of mine that you, you know, I can like, I could like, you know, I'll do a thing where I'm like, oh, I'm upside down in a tank and I'm typing a screenplay.\n\n16:12.100 --> 16:13.100\nWell, there's snakes on me.\n\n16:13.100 --> 16:18.100\nAnd then it's like, oh, look how fast and that's pretty good for snake typing.\n\n16:18.100 --> 16:22.100\nAnd then also I'll collaborate with other people.\n\n16:22.100 --> 16:32.100\nThat was the thing is as a community, I had to learn to collaborate with writers and then I had to let go of this terror I had of letting people see my process.\n\n16:32.100 --> 16:39.100\nAnd so I was explaining that to her and she said, well, are you one of these people that goes to a cafe?\n\n16:39.100 --> 16:42.100\nBecause you, you know, you want to be seen writing or something?\n\n16:42.100 --> 16:44.100\nI said, you mean a hack?\n\n16:44.100 --> 16:45.100\nNo, I'm not.\n\n16:45.100 --> 16:48.100\nShe's like, well, I don't know if those people are hacks or not.\n\n16:48.100 --> 16:53.100\nBut I was like, well, I mean, they're not, they can't be good.\n\n16:53.100 --> 16:57.100\nI like, and she's like, well, I think some people want to be seen writing.\n\n16:57.100 --> 17:00.100\nIt like makes them feel like they got to keep writing or something.\n\n17:00.100 --> 17:02.100\nI'm like, okay, all right, they're not, they're the good people.\n\n17:02.100 --> 17:04.100\nBut no, that's not me.\n\n17:04.100 --> 17:06.100\nI've never done that, which is interesting data.\n\n17:06.100 --> 17:10.100\nLike, and it's like, I wouldn't type next to Cody if I was on an airplane.\n\n17:10.100 --> 17:13.100\nLike, because she wouldn't be part of the process.\n\n17:13.100 --> 17:18.100\nSo, but I work good with collaborators and Mr. Nimoy.\n\n17:18.100 --> 17:22.100\nAnd, and, and I, and I, and I, and I can do it as performance.\n\n17:22.100 --> 17:27.100\nAnd then I was like, oh, okay, so there's something going on here.\n\n17:27.100 --> 17:32.100\nBut I use, and so she's like, so who are the people, what are the people providing?\n\n17:32.100 --> 17:39.100\nI'm like, well, you know, they let me off the hook because they're kind of like, you know, they're, they're, they're okay with whatever's going on.\n\n17:39.100 --> 17:41.100\nAnd she's like, you're, you see, you're performing.\n\n17:41.100 --> 17:46.100\nYou can, like, everyone's looking up your skirt and they're saying, like, I like that.\n\n17:46.100 --> 17:50.100\nAnd I was like, okay, yeah.\n\n17:50.100 --> 17:54.100\nAnd she's like, and so when, and so it's these times when you say, okay, I'll go do that alone.\n\n17:54.100 --> 17:59.100\nAnd then I'll bring my work back that it's like, I was like, yeah, I guess it's like saying, okay, let me go away for three hours.\n\n17:59.100 --> 18:04.100\nAnd I'm going to really do something great under my skirt and then come back and lift it up.\n\n18:04.100 --> 18:08.100\nAnd, and that, and that, yeah, enough that it's like, what are you supposed to do?\n\n18:08.100 --> 18:12.100\nAnd she's like, yeah, see so, see so.\n\n18:12.100 --> 18:20.100\nThe, the, I mean, I know you guys are going to go like, oh, that doesn't help me write it all.\n\n18:20.100 --> 18:22.100\nWell, fuck you. It's my $200.\n\n18:22.100 --> 18:25.100\nI'm just telling you what I learned.\n\n18:25.100 --> 18:34.100\nShe says, she goes, well, you know, you know, tell, tell me like a, like a, like a, like a memory of you writing.\n\n18:34.100 --> 18:36.100\nAnd I've told you guys the story.\n\n18:36.100 --> 18:40.100\nBrother got caught playing with matches and I was with him and, and then wait till your dad gets home.\n\n18:40.100 --> 18:43.100\nAnd then my, my, my mom said, well, your dad's coming home.\n\n18:43.100 --> 18:51.100\nWhy don't you write one of those stories you write about a boy that gets caught playing with matches and lives to regret it.\n\n18:51.100 --> 18:55.100\nAnd I was like, okay, good. And then I wrote the story and then I got meta.\n\n18:55.100 --> 19:01.100\nAnd I was like, at the end of the story of the little boy, like, write such a good story that the mom's like, oh, your dad doesn't have to spank you now.\n\n19:01.100 --> 19:08.100\nAnd that was the story. And I gave it to my mom and she was like, this is amazing. I don't buy the ending.\n\n19:08.100 --> 19:18.100\nAnd I was like, I think that's kind of like, you know, I've mythologized that story, but I do also think that that is truly, she's like, yeah, when you're working and you,\n\n19:18.100 --> 19:24.100\nand she said, so tell me about God and your work. And I said, I said, well, okay, this is going to be hard to, to explain.\n\n19:24.100 --> 19:31.100\nBut it's like, you get like, there, yeah, there's a God, whatever you want to call that, it's nothingness, it's the cosmos, it's life itself, whatever.\n\n19:31.100 --> 19:38.100\nIt's the Dow, it's, it's ISIS. That's what ISIS worship, right? ISIS.\n\n19:38.100 --> 19:42.100\nThat's why they're called ISIS. They worship the Greek goddess, ISIS.\n\n19:42.100 --> 19:49.100\nForm of an ISIS. That'd be amazing.\n\n19:49.100 --> 19:55.100\nIt's like, you could see how there would be, you know, there would be friction there with the rest of Islam. It's like, ISIS, what?\n\n19:55.100 --> 20:00.100\nIsn't that like a cat lady? All right.\n\n20:00.100 --> 20:05.100\nWhat are you, are you cat burglars? Is that, no, we hurt people real bad.\n\n20:05.100 --> 20:11.100\nOkay, well, and it's not funny, I guess. Well, Dan Harmon's next job is going to make it real funny.\n\n20:11.100 --> 20:15.100\nAm I going to take advice on ISIS, what was show to go to?\n\n20:15.100 --> 20:19.100\nWell, I love, love Dan Harmon's show, that's all I'm saying.\n\n20:19.100 --> 20:21.100\nGet out of here, ISIS.\n\n20:21.100 --> 20:27.100\nEveryone's a, everyone's a theater recommender.\n\n20:27.100 --> 20:29.100\nPatron.\n\n20:29.100 --> 20:32.100\nSo you're talking about God.\n\n20:32.100 --> 20:42.100\nSo I said, what has been my standard answer, which is you have to, you have to, you know, you have to be there. You have to put a hole in your chest.\n\n20:42.100 --> 20:52.100\nAnd like God comes through and because God can't write, he's like, you know.\n\n20:52.100 --> 20:55.100\nHe can write on stone with lightning.\n\n20:55.100 --> 20:59.100\nWell, I mean, you gotta like bring him the stone or something.\n\n20:59.100 --> 21:02.100\nDid that happen in the Bible?\n\n21:02.100 --> 21:07.100\nBut he can't like write an episode of Nash Bridges. He can't, I mean, it would take forever.\n\n21:07.100 --> 21:14.100\nLike, on the first day, Nash Bridges is making an omelet.\n\n21:14.100 --> 21:16.100\nAnd the fireballs are hitting the tablets.\n\n21:16.100 --> 21:22.100\nAnd he's like, I got to start a new tablet. I'm not even done with the master shot.\n\n21:22.100 --> 21:26.100\nThe doorbell rings.\n\n21:26.100 --> 21:30.100\nGod, the PAs are getting tired of walking up and down the mountain with your tablets.\n\n21:30.100 --> 21:32.100\nCan we streamline this process?\n\n21:32.100 --> 21:42.100\nYou go tell them, do you want a bad show or a good one?\n\n21:42.100 --> 21:52.100\nAnd then God finally like, this is like, we're rolling in an hour and God goes down the hill and like David Mills just lays on the set and shouts dialogue out while the actors perform.\n\n21:52.100 --> 22:01.100\nAlright. So I said, you know, you put a hole in yourself so that God comes through.\n\n22:01.100 --> 22:04.100\nYou don't want to impede it.\n\n22:04.100 --> 22:11.100\nAnd, you know, you want that hole as wide as possible.\n\n22:11.100 --> 22:15.100\nAnd like, it's going to scrape the edges of your hole.\n\n22:15.100 --> 22:18.100\nAnd that's your voice. That's your style, you know.\n\n22:18.100 --> 22:23.100\nBut like people mistake that for meaning like, oh, you got to make that whole cookie shaped, you know.\n\n22:23.100 --> 22:27.100\nLike, I'm going to, oh, look at my indie movie.\n\n22:27.100 --> 22:29.100\nYou can tell I wrote the shit out of it.\n\n22:29.100 --> 22:32.100\nAnd it's like, that's somebody that's like, their hole isn't circular.\n\n22:32.100 --> 22:34.100\nIt's not like pure, you know.\n\n22:34.100 --> 22:38.100\nIt's like, will you please let God just do his work here?\n\n22:38.100 --> 22:42.100\nHe's trying to write and he can't write because he has to use tablets otherwise.\n\n22:42.100 --> 22:45.100\nThat's not part of it.\n\n22:45.100 --> 22:51.100\nSo she said, so what I'm hearing is this process involves the removal of your heart\n\n22:51.100 --> 23:00.100\nand that you can fuck up by being too there at the moment when God is there\n\n23:00.100 --> 23:06.100\nand like you, to the extent that he's there, you have to not be there.\n\n23:06.100 --> 23:08.100\nThat's part of the process.\n\n23:08.100 --> 23:12.100\nOkay, alright. A little gotcha therapy.\n\n23:12.100 --> 23:15.100\nAnd she's like, so what do you think the other people are providing?\n\n23:15.100 --> 23:18.100\nLike, do you really believe in God?\n\n23:18.100 --> 23:19.100\nDo you think he created it?\n\n23:19.100 --> 23:20.100\nI said, I don't know.\n\n23:20.100 --> 23:28.100\nI believe that nothingness over infinity has 100% chance of deciding to explode into everything.\n\n23:28.100 --> 23:31.100\nMakes sense.\n\n23:31.100 --> 23:33.100\nI dropped out of college.\n\n23:33.100 --> 23:35.100\nMakes sense to me.\n\n23:35.100 --> 23:38.100\nI watched a Nova.\n\n23:38.100 --> 23:46.100\nAnd so I think there's an impulse to all of existence that prefers existence over non-existence.\n\n23:46.100 --> 23:47.100\nIt has a tendency.\n\n23:47.100 --> 23:53.100\nI don't think you can all the way call it consciousness and yet it's so vast and we're all a part of it.\n\n23:53.100 --> 24:00.100\nYeah, I think there's something ineffable that if you're on its side\n\n24:00.100 --> 24:06.100\nor if it sees benefit in letting you do your thing, then you have better luck.\n\n24:06.100 --> 24:09.100\nI guess you call that karma or something.\n\n24:09.100 --> 24:13.100\nOr maybe just look at it like there's a balance to the universe.\n\n24:13.100 --> 24:18.100\nSo if you're out of the moment, you tend to have shitty days because you're trying too hard.\n\n24:18.100 --> 24:22.100\nAnd then when you're in the moment, you have those days where you feel like you're in the zone.\n\n24:22.100 --> 24:28.100\nAnd that's because if you surrender to nothingness, that's like Taoism.\n\n24:28.100 --> 24:39.100\nYou're jamming along and you're tooting your horn and you're blowing your friends and you're just having...\n\n24:39.100 --> 24:41.100\nI was like, well, you can't blow a horn.\n\n24:41.100 --> 24:42.100\nYou already chewed at that.\n\n24:42.100 --> 24:43.100\nI don't know what the...\n\n24:43.100 --> 24:48.100\nWhat's the list of things people do?\n\n24:48.100 --> 24:52.100\nSo I'm letting you into my process.\n\n24:52.100 --> 24:55.100\nAnd you're telling me with your laughter, you're saying, it doesn't matter.\n\n24:55.100 --> 24:58.100\nYou can fuck up and say, toot your horn, blow your friends.\n\n24:58.100 --> 24:59.100\nWe like that.\n\n24:59.100 --> 25:03.100\nWe like everything that you do because we know that it's happening in the moment.\n\n25:03.100 --> 25:12.100\nWe like when you widen your hole so much that we don't scrape its edges.\n\n25:12.100 --> 25:16.100\nSo she's like, well, don't you think that what it is...\n\n25:16.100 --> 25:20.100\nBecause I was like, well, there was a time before community when I didn't know how to collaborate.\n\n25:20.100 --> 25:22.100\nAnd it was like, did you write then?\n\n25:22.100 --> 25:23.100\nWere you productive then?\n\n25:23.100 --> 25:25.100\nMore so than after community.\n\n25:25.100 --> 25:28.100\nAnd I think what it was is I kind of came up with this one.\n\n25:28.100 --> 25:29.100\nI'm going to give myself credit.\n\n25:29.100 --> 25:30.100\nI was like, oh.\n\n25:30.100 --> 25:37.100\nSo I think that what that means is that I lacked something that I gained from collaboration.\n\n25:37.100 --> 25:42.100\nAnd I didn't want to go back to writing alone because it would be like going off of heroin,\n\n25:42.100 --> 25:44.100\nback to just cold turkey.\n\n25:44.100 --> 25:47.100\nBut neither thing was actually what you're supposed to be doing.\n\n25:47.100 --> 25:50.100\nYou're supposed to somehow be generating this adoration.\n\n25:50.100 --> 25:53.100\nYou're supposed to love yourself and self-care.\n\n25:53.100 --> 26:00.100\nYou're supposed to atone with a God that actually is glad that you exist and is thankful that you are writing.\n\n26:00.100 --> 26:01.100\nIt doesn't care.\n\n26:01.100 --> 26:05.100\nIt doesn't think that there's any way for you to fuck up because good writer, bad writer, whatever.\n\n26:05.100 --> 26:08.100\nIt's like God's like Jeff Bridges in Starman.\n\n26:08.100 --> 26:09.100\nHe's just hanging out.\n\n26:09.100 --> 26:11.100\nHe's going like, whoa, like Nash Bridges?\n\n26:11.100 --> 26:13.100\nThat's brilliant.\n\n26:13.100 --> 26:21.100\nIt was the show, so weird that that's my go-to reference.\n\n26:21.100 --> 26:25.100\nI think it's because at my WGA orientation, they went around the table and were like,\n\n26:25.100 --> 26:27.100\ntell the story of how you got to the WGA.\n\n26:27.100 --> 26:32.100\nAnd somebody was like, I wrote a Nash Bridges and I just always thought that was so funny.\n\n26:32.100 --> 26:35.100\nBecause they worked at Nash Bridges and then someone got sick.\n\n26:35.100 --> 26:37.100\nAnd then they're like, I can write Nash Bridges.\n\n26:37.100 --> 26:42.100\nAnd I was like, this story does not reflect well on Nash Bridges.\n\n26:42.100 --> 26:48.100\nIt was just like this person was like, I deliver pepper to the Nash Bridges office.\n\n26:48.100 --> 26:52.100\nAnd then a wheel fell on someone from the salt truck.\n\n26:52.100 --> 26:59.100\nAnd they said, hey, what would a detective do if he was in Texas?\n\n26:59.100 --> 27:01.100\nI don't know where Nash Bridges is.\n\n27:01.100 --> 27:04.100\nAnd I just drew on my pepper experience.\n\n27:04.100 --> 27:09.100\nI was like, maybe he sneezes and I want an Emmy and here I am.\n\n27:09.100 --> 27:14.100\nNow I have a dental plan and fuck the pepper industry.\n\n27:14.100 --> 27:16.100\nThey act like it's an honor to work for them.\n\n27:16.100 --> 27:24.100\nI was like, Hollywood's fair.\n\n27:24.100 --> 27:29.100\nSo the bottom line is, you know, and you're like, oh, I'm a Dan Harmon fan.\n\n27:29.100 --> 27:30.100\nI'm an atheist.\n\n27:30.100 --> 27:32.100\nI hate God.\n\n27:32.100 --> 27:33.100\nI hate the concept of God.\n\n27:33.100 --> 27:34.100\nI get it.\n\n27:34.100 --> 27:35.100\nYou're smart.\n\n27:35.100 --> 27:36.100\nI love you.\n\n27:36.100 --> 27:37.100\nYou're fine.\n\n27:37.100 --> 27:38.100\nBecause I'm God.\n\n27:38.100 --> 27:39.100\nBecause I believe in God.\n\n27:39.100 --> 27:44.100\nBecause how would you be this special if there was nothing out there?\n\n27:44.100 --> 27:47.100\nLike, what do you think is coursing through me fucking magnets?\n\n27:47.100 --> 27:52.100\nYou think I was just born on a rock that had like a weird angle to it?\n\n27:52.100 --> 27:55.100\nI've got God in me.\n\n27:55.100 --> 27:58.100\nYou don't believe in it because you're like, damn, then that means he hates me.\n\n27:58.100 --> 28:03.100\nWell, be holy.\n\n28:03.100 --> 28:08.100\nYou're better than thou.\n\n28:08.100 --> 28:11.100\nNo, but look, I'm not.\n\n28:11.100 --> 28:17.100\nSome people get so triggered by the fucking G word that they're like, oh, Dan's like,\n\n28:17.100 --> 28:22.100\nlook, I'm just saying, like, it's Tom Hanks' volleyball.\n\n28:22.100 --> 28:25.100\nIt's like, you need a mythology.\n\n28:25.100 --> 28:26.100\nYou're a primate.\n\n28:26.100 --> 28:30.100\nYou were born with equipment that spontaneously generates mythology.\n\n28:30.100 --> 28:36.100\nIt's like, why would you, I'm not saying why would you, it also generates like science.\n\n28:36.100 --> 28:39.100\nAnd that's like very, we need way more atheists and skeptics.\n\n28:39.100 --> 28:42.100\nAnd we need way more science right now than we need the other thing.\n\n28:42.100 --> 28:47.100\nBut I'm just saying you do have the software and hardware in your head that you actually\n\n28:47.100 --> 28:48.100\nhave to like suppress it.\n\n28:48.100 --> 28:52.100\nLike, you tend to invent shit in your head when you're looking for a parking spot.\n\n28:52.100 --> 28:56.100\nAnd you're like, oh man, I missed that spot because I shouldn't have been a dick to that\n\n28:56.100 --> 28:57.100\nbarista.\n\n28:57.100 --> 29:00.100\nYou just, you always do it.\n\n29:00.100 --> 29:08.100\nAnd you watch stories in movies and TV that they're all like circling around this concept\n\n29:08.100 --> 29:12.100\nthat there's an order to the universe because you're a sentient monkey and it's really fucked\n\n29:12.100 --> 29:13.100\nup.\n\n29:13.100 --> 29:16.100\nWe got mentally ill when we became conscious.\n\n29:16.100 --> 29:20.100\nWe were just animals and we were like running around and there are other animals were eating\n\n29:20.100 --> 29:21.100\nus and we were eating them.\n\n29:21.100 --> 29:22.100\nAnd it was like, this is great.\n\n29:22.100 --> 29:23.100\nIt's a game of monopoly.\n\n29:23.100 --> 29:24.100\nLike, who cares?\n\n29:24.100 --> 29:25.100\nIt's fun.\n\n29:25.100 --> 29:29.100\nIt's not fun for us because we don't have claws and we're just like getting our ass\n\n29:29.100 --> 29:33.100\nkicked because we're like, who came up with this idea of being a monkey that can't be\n\n29:33.100 --> 29:34.600\nin a tree?\n\n29:34.600 --> 29:37.100\nAnd then we just kind of exploded one day.\n\n29:37.100 --> 29:38.100\nWho knows?\n\n29:38.100 --> 29:40.100\nMaybe it's just your brain gets to a certain size.\n\n29:40.100 --> 29:45.100\nMaybe if you eat enough muscles, I don't know, but get enough vitamin B or something.\n\n29:45.100 --> 29:49.100\nAnd then we were like, whoa, I get it.\n\n29:49.100 --> 29:50.100\nYou're born.\n\n29:50.100 --> 29:51.100\nAnd then you die.\n\n29:51.100 --> 29:59.100\nAnd then we looked down at the gazelle brain we were eating and we're like, oh, God, Jesus\n\n29:59.100 --> 30:00.100\nChrist.\n\n30:00.100 --> 30:01.100\nJesus Christ.\n\n30:01.100 --> 30:08.100\nAnd then we calmed down enough to get through the day, but we're just like, you know, we're\n\n30:08.100 --> 30:09.100\nlike, oh.\n\n30:09.100 --> 30:15.100\nSee, that origin story of Jesus Christ is so much less complicated than virgin birth and\n\n30:15.100 --> 30:16.100\nwise men.\n\n30:16.100 --> 30:18.600\nPeople will tell you it has something to do with Jerusalem.\n\n30:18.600 --> 30:26.600\nNo, it goes back to 30,000 B.C. and no, I'm just saying like, it's hard.\n\n30:26.600 --> 30:32.180\nWhen you watch an Eli Roth movie, the thing that you're getting high off of if you're\n\n30:32.180 --> 30:36.420\nenjoying it or the thing that's freaking you out if you're not enjoying it is that it's\n\n30:36.420 --> 30:41.660\nhitting your system as a toxicity because the signal you're getting is that nothing,\n\n30:41.660 --> 30:48.180\nyou know, you can't do anything to like make bad things not happen to good people.\n\n30:48.180 --> 30:52.060\nYou can't, you don't know when an eyeball is just going to fall out of a head or when\n\n30:52.060 --> 30:58.620\na weird Czechoslovakian company is going to print business cards that allows people\n\n30:58.620 --> 31:03.500\nto be a secret Harry Potter society that blow torches people's faces.\n\n31:03.500 --> 31:07.540\nThere's got to be other stuff those people can do.\n\n31:07.540 --> 31:08.540\nWhat are they?\n\n31:08.540 --> 31:17.460\nThe lady that just wants to lay in a bath and like use a scythe on a backpacker and\n\n31:17.460 --> 31:18.460\nbathe in her blood.\n\n31:18.460 --> 31:19.460\nLike, how many times has she done that?\n\n31:19.460 --> 31:20.460\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n31:20.460 --> 31:21.460\nI have no idea.\n\n31:21.460 --> 31:22.460\nI fell off this train.\n\n31:22.460 --> 31:23.460\nIt's one of those hostile movies.\n\n31:23.460 --> 31:24.460\nI don't know if it's hostile one or hostile two.\n\n31:24.460 --> 31:25.460\nThat was like doing mescalematic.\n\n31:25.460 --> 31:36.620\nBut yeah, I mean, there's a whole tub there she had built.\n\n31:36.620 --> 31:37.620\nYou know that.\n\n31:37.620 --> 31:41.420\nI mean, it's like, that's pretty, how many women has she bathed in the blood of?\n\n31:41.420 --> 31:45.340\nThat's got to get, like change it up.\n\n31:45.340 --> 31:47.420\nDoes she think it makes her strong?\n\n31:47.420 --> 31:48.420\nIs in that movie?\n\n31:48.420 --> 31:49.420\nIs that way?\n\n31:49.420 --> 31:51.260\nThere's no magic in that movie.\n\n31:51.260 --> 31:54.060\nIf she could jump higher when she did it, then I'd be like, okay, well, that's what\n\n31:54.060 --> 31:55.060\nhappened.\n\n31:55.060 --> 31:56.060\nLike, look how high she can jump.\n\n31:56.060 --> 31:57.940\nShe doesn't want to jump lower.\n\n31:57.940 --> 31:58.940\nThat's what happens.\n\n31:58.940 --> 31:59.940\nShe's dependent on the blood.\n\n31:59.940 --> 32:02.780\nBut I would assume that after a while she'd be like, you know, my sciatic nerve is still\n\n32:02.780 --> 32:03.780\nacting up.\n\n32:03.780 --> 32:12.540\nAnd no amount of this sticky gross blood that I bathe in is helping me not age.\n\n32:12.540 --> 32:16.260\nI'm going to try just yogurt and sitting at home and save 500 grand.\n\n32:16.260 --> 32:24.460\nOkay, so anyways, I'm just saying, I'm just saying life is like we are like God to us\n\n32:24.460 --> 32:27.340\nlike when he doesn't exist is like Eli Roth.\n\n32:27.340 --> 32:30.180\nLike it's like, it's like, oh, we're in the hands of a maniac.\n\n32:30.180 --> 32:35.180\nLike, a log could fall on my caveman friend and then it's like not his fault, it's not\n\n32:35.180 --> 32:36.180\nmy fault.\n\n32:36.180 --> 32:37.460\nAnd it's like, oh man, I just fell in love.\n\n32:37.460 --> 32:41.780\nOh, now I feel a lump and like, like, oh, now it's like a tiger to eat my baby.\n\n32:41.780 --> 32:45.300\nLike, like, like, like, you just, you just run it and also all the shitty things that\n\n32:45.300 --> 32:46.300\nyou do.\n\n32:46.300 --> 32:49.740\nYou're like, oh, I killed the tiger for killing my baby and now the tiger likes its heart\n\n32:49.740 --> 32:50.740\nlooks like my heart.\n\n32:50.740 --> 32:51.740\nAnd like, I can't take it.\n\n32:51.740 --> 32:52.740\nI can't take it.\n\n32:52.740 --> 32:55.260\nThere's no cocaine or invented yet.\n\n32:55.260 --> 32:56.500\nI can't like deal with this.\n\n32:56.500 --> 32:57.500\nI got to go.\n\n32:57.500 --> 32:58.500\nI'm just running around my cave.\n\n32:58.500 --> 32:59.500\nI'm going to freak out.\n\n32:59.500 --> 33:00.500\nFreaking out.\n\n33:00.500 --> 33:06.460\nAnd I need some coke to calm the calm down a little bit.\n\n33:06.460 --> 33:10.260\nAnd so then some smarty pants caveman was like, you know, like, well, look, here's the thing.\n\n33:10.260 --> 33:14.660\nI mean, look, you know, when that thunder happens, that's angels bowling.\n\n33:14.660 --> 33:16.660\nAnd the guy's like, go on, go on.\n\n33:16.660 --> 33:20.140\nAre you singing my tune?\n\n33:20.140 --> 33:21.740\nThat tiger killed your baby.\n\n33:21.740 --> 33:23.940\nYou got baby points.\n\n33:23.940 --> 33:29.700\nYou're going to get those back later when you become a tiger in the next life.\n\n33:29.700 --> 33:32.540\nAnd the angels are going to bowl with me.\n\n33:32.540 --> 33:37.380\nNo, that's just an ancillary cosmology that sounds like the angels just bowl like they\n\n33:37.380 --> 33:39.260\ndon't even know what the fuck's going on.\n\n33:39.260 --> 33:40.260\nOkay.\n\n33:40.260 --> 33:41.260\nYou just you're explaining thunder.\n\n33:41.260 --> 33:42.260\nYeah.\n\n33:42.260 --> 33:43.820\nDon't let the thunder freak you out.\n\n33:43.820 --> 33:47.940\nYou focus on your tiger points.\n\n33:47.940 --> 33:52.780\nWhere do you redeem your tiger baby points in the afterlife or in this in this life?\n\n33:52.780 --> 33:59.900\nYou go to confession and you say, I bless you father caveman for I had I had bad I had\n\n33:59.900 --> 34:01.580\nbad tigerless thoughts.\n\n34:01.580 --> 34:05.100\nI have two tiger points and one baby point.\n\n34:05.100 --> 34:08.940\nAnd then the father caveman says like, well, you might as well just say one tiger point\n\n34:08.940 --> 34:11.940\nbecause a baby point is the opposite of a tiger point.\n\n34:11.940 --> 34:12.940\nOkay.\n\n34:12.940 --> 34:17.420\nI heard I've been told that but you're you're you're you're ruling class doesn't let us\n\n34:17.420 --> 34:18.420\nlearn math.\n\n34:18.420 --> 34:20.780\nSo, well, there's a reason for that.\n\n34:20.780 --> 34:24.260\nWe don't want everybody just starting a random religion about every animal they see.\n\n34:24.260 --> 34:29.020\nYou're going to keep this fucking shit under your cave hat.\n\n34:29.020 --> 34:31.100\nI understand.\n\n34:31.100 --> 34:36.820\nAll right, well, I can't we haven't invented hinges or slides or knobs yet.\n\n34:36.820 --> 34:39.380\nSo we're just sitting in a rock.\n\n34:39.380 --> 34:42.260\nIt's not like we're in a booth.\n\n34:42.260 --> 34:44.100\nSo why are you telling me that?\n\n34:44.100 --> 34:45.100\nI don't know.\n\n34:45.100 --> 34:50.900\nI just I start to I guess I'm feeling like plagued with guilt being a caveman priest.\n\n34:50.900 --> 34:52.420\nLike I don't I don't hunt.\n\n34:52.420 --> 34:54.060\nI don't provide any food.\n\n34:54.060 --> 34:57.980\nWhy are you unloading who's confessing here?\n\n34:57.980 --> 34:59.780\nWhy are you laying this on me?\n\n34:59.780 --> 35:00.780\nI don't even know math.\n\n35:00.780 --> 35:01.780\nI'm a caveman.\n\n35:01.780 --> 35:03.980\nSee now I'm going to start a religion.\n\n35:03.980 --> 35:15.700\nYou protested piece of shit anyway, and that caveman name was Martin Luther's stone.\n\n35:15.700 --> 35:26.220\nIt's still a junior to you know, okay, senior Martin Luther's senior.\n\n35:26.220 --> 35:27.220\nRemember the Flintstones trailer?\n\n35:27.220 --> 35:28.220\nNo, you don't.\n\n35:28.220 --> 35:29.220\nYou're 11.\n\n35:29.220 --> 35:33.700\nThere's a Flintstones trailer and then it was like I said Steven Spielrock presents\n\n35:33.700 --> 35:34.700\nSpielrock.\n\n35:34.700 --> 35:35.700\nYeah.\n\n35:35.700 --> 35:36.700\nIt's a piss up a rope.\n\n35:36.700 --> 35:39.700\nWhat are you doing?\n\n35:39.700 --> 35:40.700\nSpielrock.\n\n35:40.700 --> 35:41.700\nYeah.\n\n35:41.700 --> 35:49.180\nThey didn't want to say Stoneburg to Jewish, I guess like I would say like it like it like\n\n35:49.180 --> 35:54.300\nshines a light on the they're like are you making a no because there probably is an actual\n\n35:54.300 --> 35:56.820\ndirector named Steven Stoneburg, right?\n\n35:56.820 --> 36:06.980\nThere's that yeah, you've got away with such hack shit back then the not the Flintstones\n\n36:06.980 --> 36:13.860\nmovie the Flint the show when every show that you see in reruns it was all like it was all\n\n36:13.860 --> 36:17.420\nbased on some like they took like a character who was like a comic back then it would be\n\n36:17.420 --> 36:21.940\nthey would just rip off their act and like draw make him an animal fucking like a bunch\n\n36:21.940 --> 36:22.940\nof hacks.\n\n36:22.940 --> 36:32.020\nOh that Phil Silvers is really funny why don't we just make him a dolphin and I don't know\n\n36:32.020 --> 36:35.700\nwhat I'm talking about Phil Silvers was on everything him and Don Adams were in every\n\n36:35.700 --> 36:39.740\ncartoon in some form or other yeah they also you know those comics they got jobs and playing\n\n36:39.740 --> 36:45.380\nthose voices yeah yeah who played the great Gazoo is a little dumb dumb was it Harvey\n\n36:45.380 --> 36:52.900\nCorman yeah yeah Harvey Cytel yeah after a after a while the Flintstones ran out of\n\n36:52.900 --> 37:00.660\ngas a little bit I guess they I guess they didn't expect it to run as long as it did\n\n37:00.660 --> 37:06.100\nbecause gas hadn't been invented because not enough dinosaurs had died to create gas\n\n37:06.100 --> 37:13.980\nso they added a fucking alien that granted wishes yeah to just be alive back then like\n\n37:13.980 --> 37:19.660\nI just just yeah I don't know but you know but none of us could have jobs you know it's\n\n37:19.660 --> 37:24.100\nlike it was it was less less television less power than consolidated I would have been just\n\n37:24.100 --> 37:28.060\nlike what would I what would I have been I would have been a I think I would have been\n\n37:28.060 --> 37:39.140\na welder because I lived I was born in Milwaukee I would have been a welder and I would make\n\n37:39.140 --> 37:43.940\nlike shitty sculpture in the backyard and people would be like what are you doing trying\n\n37:43.940 --> 37:55.940\nto get out of Milwaukee leaving alone just welding a bicycle rim to a ashtray I'm welding\n\n37:55.940 --> 38:01.140\nit I'm welding a sculpture to prove to my mom that I I've learned my lesson about playing\n\n38:01.140 --> 38:09.220\nwith matches right all right so so I said I says to the therapist I says that's how\n\n38:09.220 --> 38:13.660\nit works and she says well just be there and let the God hit you in the back and go into\n\n38:13.660 --> 38:17.820\nyour body and then you'd be like whoo it's fun to write if you if you suck or you're\n\n38:17.820 --> 38:33.420\nslow I was like you're right so I can I don't write now the long and winding road Spencer\n\n38:33.420 --> 38:44.740\nwhat's going on in politics oh let me tell you Spencer politics corner all right you\n\n38:44.740 --> 38:54.060\nguys hear about this tower fire in London town yeah it was a while ago that happened\n\n38:54.060 --> 39:00.820\noh boy it was a real mess health and safety is a big part of governmental responsibility\n\n39:00.820 --> 39:08.780\ntowards society and they really did not hold up their end of the bargain and you see the\n\n39:08.780 --> 39:15.020\nresults of that and it was very tragic and man it makes you wonder what it what you think\n\n39:15.020 --> 39:26.900\nwhen people aren't valuing the safety of the American people so flaw capitalism that was\n\n39:26.900 --> 39:33.060\nthe end of Spencer's politics I really deliver capitalism needs to be it's a great system\n\n39:33.060 --> 39:40.020\nit's worked very well it needs to be augmented as in all of your pocket apps with a additional\n\n39:40.020 --> 39:47.780\nmana currency right something about the app store not just something you can generate internally\n\n39:47.780 --> 39:52.460\nbecause then you can cheat at the game you don't have to pay anything right I recommend\n\n39:52.460 --> 39:58.180\nflogging I think we should flog ourselves you know you can you you can I don't know in\n\n39:58.180 --> 40:04.700\na way those crystals those that that alternate currency is political influence isn't it yeah\n\n40:04.700 --> 40:15.060\nyeah high right now man what you hi no way man before a show no that's not professional\n\n40:15.060 -->

know because he all is because his whole all his\n\n43:16.620 --> 43:23.020\nproblems stem from his ability to like manipulate and control that's all that's a total sacrificing\n\n43:23.020 --> 43:26.740\nof the status that she needs to have in that room needs to yeah she needs to be formidable\n\n43:26.740 --> 43:30.900\nfor me to listen to her about I tried to watch family guy three times

and it was an album like they just I don't know how recent it is but they\n\n44:56.500 --> 45:00.580\ndid an album that was kind of like a fan them making music with fans or something like that\n\n45:00.580 --> 45:05.420\nso there's like and there's an interview on the album with like a guy who invented the\n\n45:05.420 --> 45:09.620\ndrum machine or the metronome or something like that there's a guy there's a guy talking\n\n45:09.620 --> 45:15.780\nand I there was that but that's not how this conversation happened there was a there was\n\n45:15.780 --> 45:20.740\na song where someone was like singing in robot voice they were going like everybody that's\n\n45:20.740 --> 45:23.820\nnot a robot you can't do an impression of robot that was Michael McDonald from the\n\n45:23.820 --> 45:32.140\nprevious yeah I thought I could just do an impression of yeah I but but you know that\n\n45:32.140 --> 45:37.900\nrobot voice like not share auto-tune voice but just like take me to Funky Town robot voice\n\n45:37.900 --> 45:51.180\nlike like size old-school Cylons kids I will make you 40 before I'm 50 and then I'm gonna\n\n45:51.180 --> 45:55.820\nretire and you're gonna take over and I'm gonna be I'm gonna be fucking I'm gonna be\n\n45:55.820 --> 46:07.900\nin the Caimans just counting my Michael Jackson chimp movie money hundred dollars from Netflix\n\n46:07.900 --> 46:15.860\nI really got a iron grip on this industry I'm sure they pay very fairly I haven't closed\n\n46:15.860 --> 46:21.100\nmy deal I spent so do you have it I think you let's try to finish my story cuz I'll\n\n46:21.100 --> 46:25.660\nnever all right well I'm gonna lose it though I'm story let's put an air quotes it's more\n\n46:25.660 --> 46:30.060\nof a slice of life can you catch me up yeah yeah I was listening to Daft Punk and there\n\n46:30.060 --> 46:34.020\nwas a robot voice all right not being that familiar with Daft Punk I was like is that\n\n46:34.020 --> 46:38.780\nis that is the person singing in the robot filter is that the is that the Daft Punk\n\n46:38.780 --> 46:43.700\nman is he like is is is there like a lead singer and does he does he do a lot of robot\n\n46:43.700 --> 46:52.500\nsinging and and and Mike said no no it's like a guest guest vocalist like they're you know\n\n46:52.500 --> 46:59.260\nlargely a instrumental group and but and they're French so I don't think they would want to\n\n46:59.260 --> 47:05.900\nsing because then they it would just sound weird cuz they'd be like you must listen to\n\n47:05.900 --> 47:14.500\nthe robots and I thought that was really funny you must listen to the robots as I wrote it\n\n47:14.500 --> 47:22.020\ndown and fuck you I knew it wasn't gonna lay I knew I was like I wanted to share it like\n\n47:22.020 --> 47:29.260\nthat I didn't expect you to laugh it's a little laugh it's a little glimpse into your day it's\n\n47:29.260 --> 47:33.740\na nice moment we had there was there's you need to listen to the robots it's funny you\n\n47:33.740 --> 47:41.980\nknow you don't think about how that how antithetical French stuff is to robot stuff it's not like\n\n47:41.980 --> 47:44.780\nsomething you think about but then you go like yeah you know that's not near each other\n\n47:44.780 --> 47:50.820\non the color wheel no good reason it's just kind of funny the idea of a French robot or\n\n47:50.820 --> 47:54.980\na French French robotics I'm sure they're very capable as you see that thing of course\n\n47:54.980 --> 47:58.780\nyou said I think about the one of the Afghani girl robotics team that couldn't get in the\n\n47:58.780 --> 48:04.340\ncountry yeah bullshit I mean could you could you feel like somebody go down there with\n\n48:04.340 --> 48:09.540\na briefcase and be like oops like like you pass like they're not even concerned about\n\n48:09.540 --> 48:15.300\nthe PR thing then be concerned you just turned away the what a bunch of people that were\n\n48:15.300 --> 48:21.180\nlike oh I know why I'm not you know gonna cause any trouble it's because I fucking I\n\n48:21.180 --> 48:25.620\ndon't want to be in the world of technology and all this shit literally no back to back\n\n48:25.620 --> 48:29.780\nto Afghanistan with you but but but one thing has changed about you on this trip you now\n\n48:29.780 --> 48:37.780\nhate America so do what you will with your robotics skills which are now part of a rogue\n\n48:37.780 --> 48:45.900\nstate and if your angle is that that we don't want Afghani robot robot ladies here because\n\n48:45.900 --> 48:52.260\nthey're against the American way we are a nazi put us on the moon like I don't understand\n\n48:52.260 --> 49:00.780\nwhat is what is what is what is the mentality

system applesauce it was an okay guess\n\n57:50.380 --> 57:55.100\nyou should have said at this lab systematic and you should have you should have you should\n\n57:55.100 --> 58:03.500\nhave a handle

get disappeared and I didn't think to save it so it's gone\n\n01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:09.180\nthat was still satisfying I love it yeah that was pretty good where's Rob how come he doesn't\n\n01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:16.220\ncome to the show anymore he's got a wife he had a wife when he was on the show too well\n\n01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.580\nthat's just what he says I don't know I believe him but I don't know yeah it'd be great for\n\n01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:32.140\nhim to be here tonight yeah but remember when Norman Lear was here whew was Rob misbehaving\n\n01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:40.700\nduring Norman Lear he was great it'd be great for anybody to be here you know I'm on fire\n\n01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:48.260\nbut how much more can I burn how much God can I let through me let's see let's find\n\n01:00:48.260 --> 01:01:04.980\nout but you you you sing you want God to pass through you but then you also told us earlier\n\n01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.820\nthat you are God so how does what do you think happens when God passes through you and what\n\n01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:13.140\nwas my therapy story about it's I'm saying I used to let God go through the hole now\n\n01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:21.700\nGod comes in he don't get out you're like you're like a roach motel for God yeah well\n\n01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:28.140\nI caught God like a leprechaun and I wished for the gold of good writing but does God\n\n01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:33.420\nwant to get out he probably wants to get out he might miss his old life from time to time\n\n01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:46.740\nbut you know he he he wanted to see what it's like to be me so yeah you know I'm so like\n\n01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:52.660\nlike like what I can't I can't I can't let him out I'm not God I thought you are God\n\n01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:59.860\nnow that God's inside you yeah but he's trapped I'm saying I can't it gives nothing I can\n\n01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:04.340\ndo about it yeah you're God you just don't want God to get up and he's not gonna be God\n\n01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:07.580\nanymore and then you're gonna go shit I should have kept God in there and you know that God's\n\n01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.180\nnot coming back in you when you let him out you're like that fucker kept me in there for\n\n01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:16.300\nlike four weeks you're making me sound like the devil now as if but you're making it sound\n\n01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:22.100\nlike I really tricked God because I was really the devil and now I trapped him and now I\n\n01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:27.980\nhave all God's power and I'm actually the devil here on earth right to woo people with\n\n01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:37.260\nmy liberal virtue signaling into an anti-Christ movement that appears on its face to be a\n\n01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:43.980\nholy cult that's how I get you and then you have the number Harmon on your head and then\n\n01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:55.500\nit's like doomsday and it turns out Trump was Christ think about it like would you would\n\n01:02:55.500 --> 01:03:00.340\nyou if you were the anti-Christ would you come back as a person who looked exactly like\n\n01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:05.220\nthe anti-Christ and acted like him as it's Jesus has come back in the form of Donald\n\n01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:11.860\nTrump and because he's again he he's we're literally going to crucify him but you need\n\n01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:20.180\na reason I don't know it's a working theory I I had another theory that he's what he's\n\n01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:25.740\nit's we're in a state we're in his dream because he's just like he's the only he's like we're\n\n01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.780\nall just like we just took us this long to start realizing like because he's about to\n\n01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:35.540\ndie and his dream will of old age and and and like his dreams going to be over good\n\n01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:40.740\nsafe good safe and so and so it's like it's kind of like the end the the whole end of\n\n01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.500\neverything like where it's like coalescing like like we walked around thinking we're\n\n01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.500\na part of this like regular world but we didn't know we were just like in the we're in a\n\n01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:55.300\nJacob's ladder scenario yeah I guess so but we're all Macaulay Culkin oh yeah we're back\n\n01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:59.500\nto home alone we're back on home alone again what's going on he's in Jacob's ladder okay\n\n01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:05.620\nI don't want to spoil Jacob's ladder but Macaulay Culkin's in it sounds like a joke but he is\n\n01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:13.300\nif I tell you who he is it's kind of a spoiler because he's Tim Robin's dead son that sounds\n\n01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:19.700\na lot like a spoiler yeah it sounds a lot like it yeah where is our Macaulay Culkin\n\n01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:25.380\nis he doing all right I don't I think he I think he would say yes but I think like objective\n\n01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:31.180\nreports are that he seems like he he's not well right that he's if you see him out that\n\n01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:39.980\nhe's you know he could use a hug and maybe like some broccoli but you know who hangs\n\n01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:44.140\nout with him Seth Green oh yeah we could have Seth on and we could ask him how's Macaulay\n\n01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:51.700\ndoing we could have Macaulay on probably bring us some broccoli hug the shit out of him\n\n01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:57.660\nbut when Macaulay comes we're gonna put boards with nails under all the windows fucking get\n\n01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:03.860\nthat guy you guys saw the theory online that Macaulay Culkin's character in home alone\n\n01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:13.620\ngrows up to become jigsaw it's pretty well thought out the time works where it works\n\n01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:20.860\nreally well that he like gets a taste for human trapping and wait the timeline works\n\n01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:27.900\npretty well I think so in that home alone happened before saw movies I can tell from\n\n01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:31.620\nthe tone of your voice that you're about to prove me wrong so no I just think that's\n\n01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:39.260\nvery sound if you're saying that home before you're sarcastically high-fiving me I don't\n\n01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:44.460\nyou know I'm not gonna comment on your commenting because it might be right or it might be wrong\n\n01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:50.700\nbut you're saying of course the timing works one movie is set well yeah well one kid and\n\n01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:57.980\nthen presumably jigsaw is older so yeah that works out perfectly how would it not how would\n\n01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:06.380\nthat not work stay down Dan stay down because you clearly haven't seen the soft franchise\n\n01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:10.220\nthey fuck with the unlinear storytelling a lot there's a lot of flashbacks to like he\n\n01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:17.540\nworks in a soup kitchen in the 80s or something so maybe it doesn't work so there oh okay but\n\n01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:30.580\nthen there's that flash forward in home alone three where he's working at that soup kitchen\n\n01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:37.340\nwhat is that what does that talk boy say what's the filthy kids oh hey kids we're home early\n\n01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:42.940\nthat's the only one I remember someone says that it's in the I think it's one of the one\n\n01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:49.020\nof the bandits says that no the talk boy right the talk boy says hey kids we're home early\n\n01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:53.620\nin the commercial he goes hey kids we're home early and then he pitches it down and it goes\n\n01:06:53.620 --> 01:07:00.340\nhey kids we're home early and then the boyfriend he gets uncomfortable because he was getting\n\n01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:06.220\na little close you know oh so in the commercial parents were coming home little kid using\n\n01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:12.420\nit to freak out yeah teenage yeah sounds like the slut shamed sister yeah it is well it's\n\n01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:19.900\nnot her fault it's his fault it's 9-11 9-11 really wow remember that video we saw you\n\n01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:25.420\nknow it's hot in Burbank but only a part of the audience cheers for 9-11 I hope it's hotter\n\n01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.820\nup here than it is down there but probably not you guys Diana I'm under lights but you\n\n01:07:28.820 -->

word for it they love they're\n\n01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:44.580\nmore comfortable when they're on top of each other that's nice they're like kind of like\n\n01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:48.900\nwhen you see a lone roach you're seeing a roach that is like stressed out that feels the way\n\n01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:54.980\nyou feel when you see a roach it's like it's like it's like a woody Allen roach that's\n\n01:07:54.980 --> 01:08:02.740\nlike I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing that was a terrible your roaches an older Jewish\n\n01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:10.500\nman from New York well isn't he an

right it's not a big deal Tom fell good on\n\n01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:29.100\nyou Tom tells unconscious all right so well and yet woke so we run downstairs so I run\n\n01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:36.620\ndownstairs and go off in pursuit of the ghost yep all right it's it seems to be going a\n\n01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:42.340\nbit north towards the edge of town the location of the graveyard even though I don't need\n\n01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:48.660\nit because we're following a ghost I use no direction so I can discern north oh it's that\n\n01:31:48.660 --> 01:32:02.420\nway all right I just wanted to use that level zero spell yes good well we're walking notes\n\n01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:07.780\ndiarrhea how do you think that went down what would we do right would be how can we avoid\n\n01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:13.060\nI wasn't you know I got caught up in the moment and I wasn't really paying attention to what\n\n01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:19.340\nyou guys are doing I would be woodpeckers or I'm really ashamed of myself and I let fear\n\n01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:26.620\ntake over I should just talk to that woman before acting so violently you know it wasn't\n\n01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:34.700\nvery churchly of me well we're a different kind of church we're part of the church militants\n\n01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:44.220\nwe're out here to kick button you know and diarrhea I think I don't I think that it's\n\n01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:50.140\ngreat this is what this is what it's all about it's about penitents after the fact like it's\n\n01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:55.700\nnot whether you make mistakes about how you repair so good job like I'll tell you what\n\n01:32:55.700 --> 01:33:03.100\nI did wrong everything like I ran my mouth I I thought I ran upstairs when I shouldn't\n\n01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:06.740\nknow if I like went in there you know it's just like I got a hang back and I got a slow\n\n01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:14.780\nmy role I haven't been out of the place that I was before the adventure started in a while\n\n01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:19.580\nduring this I'm taking some cloth and bandaging up my sliced ankles and I also use some cloth\n\n01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:27.340\nto bandage bandage DJ up to all right then you succeeded that but it's never too late\n\n01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:31.580\nto start fresh that's what I wanted to say I say we start like let's say we got off to\n\n01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:38.020\na bouncy start but now mistakes were made lessons were learned let's be professional about this\n\n01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:42.180\nlet's look under every bed and every room we go into from now on and let's also you\n\n01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:48.180\nknow let's let's let's when we encounter other people let's not assume that they're monsters\n\n01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:57.540\nand that they're hiding something that's I'm talking to myself I think that the silver\n\n01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:03.380\nflame is shining on us in a world where a bouncy mission can result in a child being\n\n01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:10.140\nfreed of an evil spirit that was beautiful there were no deaths on that beautiful did\n\n01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:16.380\nthe ghost just leave or we are we still following him okay we're walking talk yeah that was\n\n01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:27.060\na walk and talk how close are we to the graveyard oh man you're there oh all right the graveyards\n\n01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:32.340\non the edge of this little this this forest the forest stands thick isn't and imposing\n\n01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:38.740\nit looms over the buildings of the tiny town kind of like like like an ominous horizon\n\n01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:46.260\nof clouds there's air coming from the forest it feels a bit more fresh than like the stale\n\n01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:51.420\ntown air but you make your way to the graveyard it's a little rickety graveyard for a small\n\n01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:55.700\nlittle town but there's a lot of graves in it more than you'd expect for a town of this\n\n01:34:55.700 --> 01:35:02.820\nsize which is about 10 people conservatively it's a little graveyard just full of graves\n\n01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:14.340\nyou see some graves yeah I examine the dates of the deceased oh there's no dates that says\n\n01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:23.740\nif someone didn't read them down I have no idea when these people died maybe they didn't\n\n01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:28.820\nwant us to know what do you think we could tell just from looking at the freshness of\n\n01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:35.780\nthe graves like what's the ratio of fresh graves to old graves you see you see there's\n\n01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:43.500\nmaybe about three graves that seem pretty fresh like like less than a month fresh where\n\n01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:49.820\ndid the ghost go the ghost it went over to the to the thing and it kind of went like\n\n01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:55.860\nabove the graveyard and it kind of faded out and went so it didn't go to any specific\n\n01:35:55.860 --> 01:36:00.580\ngrave not at the moment do you think it was mad at us that sound do you think that's the\n\n01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:03.500\nsound of it leaving or do you think it was like I think I think you're projecting I\n\n01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:09.460\nthink I think ghosts make weird scary sounds that's that's that's what ghosts do I think\n\n01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:16.100\nyou know you're being needlessly you know oh at the same time Don is starting to break\n\n01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:21.460\nyou've been up all night I go over and read the names on the graves of the freshest ones\n\n01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:31.220\nall right the freshest ones the freshest ones are are are okay Ving Reims Blazen Bazin and\n\n01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:36.620\nArcher fell those are the three graves that seem freshest guys we need to focus on this\n\n01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:45.500\nVing Reims character who who's a second one he died by the way like within a month well\n\n01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:54.140\nI don't know who's the second name after Ving Reims before Archer Blazen Bazin he was related\n\n01:36:54.140 --> 01:37:08.860\nto Jerry Lewis I think I thought like Jeff Leppard write songs about him okay I think\n\n01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:13.100\nwe might want to examine the grave of Archer and maybe see how he died sure do some forensic\n\n01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:17.980\nstudy should I take my shovel out and dig well let's oh yeah you have a shovel sorry\n\n01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:22.340\nwell let's let's before we do that because I mean we're I feel like we're we're in the\n\n01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:28.860\nblack with the family you know like yeah let's just read the headstone it's a regular headstone\n\n01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:39.060\nyeah it says Archer fell that's all it's regular yeah all right dig it up dig it up look I\n\n01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:44.300\njust want to I want to do right by you guys you know I sometimes I might suggest a stupid\n\n01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:50.740\nthing you just got to tell me right I'm gonna dig up this grave though I take out my foldable\n\n01:37:50.740 --> 01:38:02.300\nshovel fold it out start digging all right okay yeah wait yeah great you dig a hole in\n\n01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:08.420\nthe ground you dig and you dig and you find you find the coffin the wooden cheap coffin\n\n01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:15.340\nthe coffin of a peasant it has it has what do you call it like you see slightly curved\n\n01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:22.500\nscuff marks divots on it like like things have been hitting the outside of the coffin\n\n01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:30.940\nrecently do you see those mark I mean is that normal marks for when you put the describe\n\n01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:39.540\nthe marks again sorry they seem like shovel marks I compare the shovel head of diarrhea\n\n01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:45.540\njunior shoveled it matches up perfect no no it's just it's just it's a different shovel\n\n01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:51.060\nit's a more a more worksman shovel Steve's shovel is like a little trenching shovel it's\n\n01:38:51.060 --> 01:39:00.060\nkind of like a little compact I'm sure yeah but it lets him achieve great speeds yeah I'm\n\n01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:07.460\nsure you use it very well yeah the the but that's important to me this is a we're we\n\n01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:13.580\njust exhumed a we're re-exhuming a grave yeah that's data I it's it's not open though right\n\n01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:20.220\nthe well it's your it's mostly still covered you're just seeing like I'll take some work\n\n01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:25.060\nif you want to get the coffin out of the ground we all I start helping dig around and get\n\n01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:27.900\nthe coffin all right well what's your goal do you want to get the coffin out of the ground\n\n01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:33.540\nor just into an openable state or what are you trying to do openable state okay all right\n\n01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:38.820\nyou do that you get the live lit off and you notice that most of the nails are gone and\n\n01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:49.900\ninside you just see the corpse of a dog it's like a rotting dog what this is fucked up\n\n01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:57.340\nI call out to the to archer if Archer's spirit is still present are you here you get no\n\n01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:04.100\nresponse all right oh at this point it's like say about eight in the morning it's past dawn\n\n01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:11.500\nbecause it takes a while to dig up a great guys it takes a community to what no that's\n\n01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:22.340\njust because that's over it takes a Rick and a Morty for six seasons we have it it takes\n\n01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:30.060\nit I I'm going to cut to the end what I'm going to say it's it's morning I think we\n\n01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:37.380\nshould we should cover this back up as quickly as possible and because we're the rest of\n\n01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:41.940\nour mission is going to have to do with finding facts from people that might not be willing\n\n01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:45.820\nto talk to us right okay I just examine the dog and rest of the coffin to see if there's\n\n01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:52.780\nanything interesting on the like like like a collar identifying it or anything like that\n\n01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:56.740\nno nothing on the dog or anything nothing nothing else in the coffin besides the corpse\n\n01:40:56.740 --> 01:41:01.500\nof the dog no there's nothing like remaining it just seems kind of like it was disturbed\n\n01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:06.500\na little bit yeah so they took this body out for some nefarious magic and left a dog in\n\n01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:12.380\nits place how old I mean how long do you think this dog has been buried here the dog seems\n\n01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:16.580\nlike it's been rotting for a while like it seems mostly decayed like it was decaying\n\n01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:21.820\nbefore they tossed it in there's another scenario that involves two exhumations the second being\n\n01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:27.580\nours is that the dog was put in the coffin for weight it's part of a fake funeral the\n\n01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:38.020\nboy was never in it and then girl the girl I don't see gender the the and that either\n\n01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:44.620\nthe family or maybe the other family that was burnt to death or who knows like got suspicious\n\n01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:49.500\ndug it up found out the truth paid for it with their life I mean there's that scenario\n\n01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:57.380\ntoo should we dig up being rams or should we just I think I think you're right you want\n\n01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:04.820\nto go ahead into town this morning yeah well let's let's put the diarrhea rebury this coffin\n\n01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:10.300\nokay we probably all chip in you know many hands make a quick one I don't have any moved\n\n01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:20.260\ndirt spells that's okay why don't you cast use hands I start burying the dog again I\n\n01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:31.060\nhelp all right all right yeah I cast detect high road I'm I help to it's an opportunity\n\n01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:42.580\nto I believe that a strenuous labor is a punishment that will make me a purer you believe that\n\n01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:47.460\nall right you do the thing it's buried it's it looks pretty fresh but what are you going\n\n01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:52.580\nto do right I think I'm gonna make it look a little fresher maybe put some pitchforks\n\n01:42:52.580 --> 01:43:06.540\non the I just need to die was that the pitchforks a straight reference yeah the idea of freshness\n\n01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:12.860\nas urban culture from the 80s right that's that's that's a pretty deep cut yeah all right\n\n01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:16.620\nlet's head let's head into town and start asking some questions you guys maybe a get\n\n01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:22.780\nsomething to eat we haven't eaten I know and we just did a lot of calorie burning

their spells that's brutal who it's enough to make a kid haunt the\n\n01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:19.460\nworld wonder what they're trying to reanimate reanimate is no you said you said

it's like it's literally like six\n\n01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:00.780\nor seven buildings you see a building that looks kind of like a half dome like made out of clay\n\n01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:06.460\nyou see a couple buildings that just look like little small wooden buildings one of them has two\n\n01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:11.500\nstories the other end has one story you see like the one-story building has a little garden\n\n01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:17.460\noutside of it and then there's just two more regular looking homes and then another farmhouse\n\n01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:23.220\nother than Tom's and then there's the church so and then there's a big concrete building with a\n\n01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:33.260\ngiant fiberglass hot dog on top yeah so there's no signage that would indicate like inns taverns\n\n01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:51.220\nhotels bistros boutiques je n'ai c'est quoi c'est mad it could wait for a half hour to say that\n\n01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:58.900\nthere's not a lot of signs but as you enter you kind of walk towards the center of town which is\n\n01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:03.420\nlike a little hill you see the old one of the only signs you've seen so far which is a sign that\n\n01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:09.460\njust says dairy hill and there's like a tree on the top of the hill and you see a woman kind of\n\n01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:16.100\njust standing around just looking around and then she sits on the ground except then she sees you\n\n01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:32.260\nso she stands back up okay maybe she has some cheese dairy oh it's spelled D e r r y oh all right\n\n01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:36.900\nwell let's maybe she probably knows good spots for breakfast we should go up there to dairy hill\n\n01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:48.180\nyeah you who I don't say you who oh yeah Carlos you're kind of the mouthpiece why don't you\n\n01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:57.620\ngo make her her acquaintance all right young woman hey hey

01:49:16.340\nthe silver flame yes I'm new here you have me at an advantage hmm I'm Rhonda you're right right\n\n01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:28.500\nRhonda Rhonda of the watch what do you keep watch over the town someone's got to do it what do you\n\n01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:40.180\nwatch for trouble seen any well lately no just recently there's been a lot of livestock's being\n\n01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:45.700\nmutilated and murdered like three or four cows by now it's been ramping up it's pretty it's a lot\n\n01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:50.740\nyou know you lose a cow that's almost you know you're whole lively we passed a couple cows and\n\n01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:57.220\nan old guy out in the field recently those those cows seem to be doing all right yeah\n\n01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:05.300\nuh any any dogs missing\n\n01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:14.020\nuh not that I can think of but I don't really keep track there's just you know wild dogs\n\n01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:18.100\nsometimes coming in out of town they're sure they're real trouble so you're not a watchdog\n\n01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:27.940\nno I do watch your dogs you do watchdogs I thought you never mind I am I go back to where I was\n\n01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:34.020\nstanding before I walked up and said that so livestock gone missing huh we'll be mutilated\n\n01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:44.100\nwe we found it oh can you take me to some of them oh yeah she takes you to tom fells farm oh shit oh\n\n01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:52.260\nscene of the crime they're not going to give us any food here I just you know I I thought\n\n01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:57.460\nI would have stopped her halfway through this journey but here we are just kind of like\n\n01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:01.540\nlost in thought and you don't have to we don't you could stop we don't have to go all the way\n\n01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:07.220\nare you taking us to tom fells farm all right yeah I was I say we were doing that right before we\n\n01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:17.460\nleave uh so is the bulk of the uh strangeness happening at tom fells farm well I'd say maybe\n\n01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:21.780\nhalf of the cows that are killed were his but that's because we basically have two farmers\n\n01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:32.740\nhmm so who's the other farmer uh donovan manneal where does he live over there\n\n01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:40.900\ndo they have a business rivalry uh yeah I guess I didn't I didn't really thought about it to be\n\n01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:47.620\nhonest but they must I mean they can't be price fixing that would be a violation of antitrust\n\n01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:57.380\nlegislation they're supposed to compete with each other unlike airlines who who makes a better\n\n01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:05.540\nbreakfast burrito because Carlos he loves those breakfast burritos hmm um well we don't really\n\n01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:13.140\ndo food service here like I got some cheese you want some cheese we'll eat that while you\n\n01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:21.220\ntake us to Darren McLaren's farm donovan who he means donovan manneal manneal of course\n\n01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:28.420\nyeah you wrote down that strap on site too\n\n01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:39.140\nall right uh the manneal house is is pretty pretty close it's right there you're right there\n\n01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:46.100\nI

weird mood he's like\n\n01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:58.740\nwhat do you guys want I'm busy here to help with your cattle problem oh it's not my problem\n\n01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:06.100\nthat's just the life of a farmer my man word around town is your cattle problems are\n\n01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:15.220\nare nothing normal at all well normal normal is what you make of it in a world with ghosts\n\n01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:20.020\nand demons and monsters and stuff like cattle mutilations are shitty but it's just part of\n\n01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:25.140\nbeing a farmer I mean I lost a couple cattle here or there but you don't see me making a big stink\n\n01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:31.860\nof it not like Tom fell bitching and moaning like his kid getting sick some big deal kids get sick\n\n01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:36.020\nmy kid got sick it just happened I didn't go bitching around he got better it's fine\n\n01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:43.380\ndid the ghosts and demons mutilate your cows what no probably not I mean well let's just say no\n\n01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:50.100\nI mean I guess it's time to sense motive\n\n01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:55.140\num you sense that he doesn't like
