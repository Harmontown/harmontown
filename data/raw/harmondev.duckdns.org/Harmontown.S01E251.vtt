WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.680
For a beautiful uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.

00:20.680 --> 00:28.100
Spencer Crittenden then.

00:28.100 --> 00:43.100
He's a man with a plaid pillow because he probably has hemorrhoids at the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:43.100 --> 00:50.100
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you for coming out. Happy summer. Happy Burbank to you.

00:50.100 --> 00:54.100
Do you need a better chair? We could get you a chair.

00:54.100 --> 00:59.100
Eventually, sure. Let's put that on a vision board.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.100
Are you getting sore buns over there on your plastic chair?

01:02.100 --> 01:10.100
I have in the past. I figured it out. You know, these plaid pillows, we got them from Harmon Quest Season 2 tapings.

01:10.100 --> 01:18.100
They were bought as mostly, I think, a joke by the people who furnished the green rooms.

01:18.100 --> 01:23.100
And then they just gave them to me afterwards because they only bought them as a joke.

01:23.100 --> 01:27.100
So you're mad that they came out of the budget for your show?

01:27.100 --> 01:34.100
Yeah, it's really wasteful in my opinion. No, no, it was great, but it's just great that I really can use it.

01:34.100 --> 01:39.100
Because it's like, you know, and then I was like, great, now I have these pillows. I don't really have anywhere to put them.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.100
Why not put them on my ass?

01:42.100 --> 01:48.100
In the 80s, especially in animation, there was a heavy tradition of characters that could turn into other things.

01:48.100 --> 01:55.100
And then they would keep their motif if they turned into something like plastic man could turn into anything,

01:55.100 --> 02:02.100
but he always had this belt and a little outfit that would be stretched around the middle of the car.

02:02.100 --> 02:09.100
And there was Rubik the Amazing Cube who could turn into things, but he always had this weird blue decaying ET head.

02:09.100 --> 02:14.100
Because someone said, well, it's just a Rubik's Cube. We have to make it adorable.

02:14.100 --> 02:21.100
And they put this fucking weird ET head on it, like mistaking just any alien head for a cube.

02:21.100 --> 02:25.100
And it was really disturbing and not at all Rubik-oriented.

02:25.100 --> 02:30.100
Really drifted from Rubik's original vision.

02:30.100 --> 02:35.100
People only know him for his cube, but he saw a world of order.

02:35.100 --> 02:41.100
He never intended people to mess those things up. He was racist.

02:41.100 --> 02:45.100
Rubik's Cube was all white.

02:45.100 --> 02:53.100
But he married a wonderful Latina lady, and as a result he became a little less racist

02:53.100 --> 03:00.100
and that he was like, let's make this cube six different colors, but still so into the separation of them.

03:00.100 --> 03:03.100
He credited himself with being more open-minded.

03:03.100 --> 03:07.100
The goal is to separate all the races.

03:07.100 --> 03:13.100
And that was the slogan at the end of the commercials. He would pop up at the bottom of the screen and go,

03:13.100 --> 03:18.100
don't forget to separate all the races.

03:18.100 --> 03:23.100
It's a separate but equal exclamation point on the box.

03:23.100 --> 03:28.100
He just thought he wasn't racist because that's what white people are good at.

03:28.100 --> 03:33.100
They're good at fooling themselves into thinking that all kinds of racism is not racist.

03:33.100 --> 03:37.100
It's in our blood. We were good at it.

03:37.100 --> 03:40.100
That's also Harmontown's motto, I think.

03:40.100 --> 03:44.100
Separate those races.

03:44.100 --> 03:48.100
The point that you were going at is that Spencer brings on a plaid pillow.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.100
That's what he turns into.

03:50.100 --> 03:53.100
If Spencer turned into a pillow, that's what it would look like.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.100
It would be this plaid pillow and have glasses and a beard on it.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.100
That would be so good.

03:58.100 --> 04:04.100
It would be great if we were like the super friends and we were just hanging out and turning into pillows and stuff.

04:04.100 --> 04:09.100
Oh, it would be like Steven Universe.

04:09.100 --> 04:16.100
Dan, you would turn into an Adderall.

04:16.100 --> 04:24.100
I didn't know this bit was an opportunity to take shots at each other.

04:24.100 --> 04:28.100
You would turn into an old-timey typewriter, I think.

04:28.100 --> 04:32.100
You'd be like a little typewriter on wheels.

04:32.100 --> 04:35.100
We're talking about characters that can turn into anything.

04:35.100 --> 04:39.100
That's why they have to retain those physical characteristics.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.100
The super friends is another one.

04:41.100 --> 04:45.100
They would say Wonder Twin powers activate and then one of them could turn into any animal

04:45.100 --> 04:50.100
and one of them could turn into any kind of thing that involved water, which included ice.

04:50.100 --> 04:53.100
And a bucket to hold the water.

04:53.100 --> 04:57.100
Wait, I can turn into other things besides water.

04:57.100 --> 05:06.100
At one point he turned into an ice giant and it was like, all right, wait a minute.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.100
I was like, why don't you turn into Ice Superman?

05:08.100 --> 05:12.100
I can't remember if he did that or if that was in my just bitchings about it.

05:12.100 --> 05:17.100
Ice giant? What does he have? Ice arteries and ice heart?

05:17.100 --> 05:21.100
Ice is just anything, then fuck you.

05:21.100 --> 05:26.100
I think he was like a form of a nice helicopter.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.100
It's silly.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.100
There's moving parts. Just stop it.

05:29.100 --> 05:32.100
Where is the verisimilitude, Wonder Twins?

05:32.100 --> 05:35.100
That's my question.

05:35.100 --> 05:38.100
I know we've talked about this before, because whenever Super Friends comes up,

05:38.100 --> 05:43.100
the thing that I think is so funny is that there was obviously a push for diversity,

05:43.100 --> 05:49.100
70s style from that cartoon, and they added this guy who I can't remember the superhero's name.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.100
Is it El Diablo or El Dorado?

05:52.100 --> 05:58.100
He was a Latino gentleman, but I never saw him in the cartoon.

05:58.100 --> 06:05.100
They just had him in the title sequence to just like, maybe there was like protests happening outside of the Super Friends building

06:05.100 --> 06:09.100
where they draw the cartoon and they're just like, shut up.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.100
His name is El Dorado.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.100
Caesar Chavez is holding great protest right now on the streets.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.100
We've got to get some Mexicans on this.

06:16.100 --> 06:24.100
In the title sequence, El Dorado has a medallion, and he's like a handsome kind of darkly-complected man,

06:24.100 --> 06:31.100
and he just has this red cape, and he just whips it over his face and disappears.

06:31.100 --> 06:35.100
You never see him in the show.

06:35.100 --> 06:38.100
That was the diversity push.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.100
He's invisible, but he's always there.

06:40.100 --> 06:47.100
He supports the Super Friends community with his, he works for Lassim.

06:47.100 --> 06:53.100
There was that time when the Wondertons were walking down a beach and there was six set of footprints.

06:53.100 --> 07:00.100
That's how you know when your unfairly paid labor force was carrying you.

07:00.100 --> 07:06.100
All the while sending money home, and boy.

07:06.100 --> 07:13.100
I'm just saying, I'm a Californian. I know better than the rest of the country this concept

07:13.100 --> 07:20.100
that my heart bleeds for our wonderful friends from down south.

07:20.100 --> 07:25.100
It must be a terrifying time for them. What a great show.

07:25.100 --> 07:28.100
We're experiencing that thing right now. They're fucking with journalists,

07:28.100 --> 07:33.100
and of course they started with immigrants.

07:33.100 --> 07:36.100
I know it's cliche, but it's like, come on, you're next.

07:36.100 --> 07:39.100
It doesn't matter how white you are, it doesn't matter, you're next, you're next.

07:39.100 --> 07:44.100
You're either going to put on the jumpsuit and get into the honeycomb in the Mars base,

07:44.100 --> 07:48.100
or you're going to be, I mean, there's not, I don't know what people keep thinking.

07:48.100 --> 07:56.100
They keep thinking, oh, if we just are polite enough, if we just adhere to our own rules

07:56.100 --> 08:01.100
of what makes good people enough, this is going to blow over.

08:01.100 --> 08:06.100
I don't know, man. It's like, it's hard to say these words,

08:06.100 --> 08:12.100
but it's just not going to stop until, and then you have to stop talking

08:12.100 --> 08:15.100
because then you're, what are you encouraging? I don't know.

08:15.100 --> 08:18.100
We all have to just sit cross-legged in the street and just eat Twinkies

08:18.100 --> 08:21.100
until the world stops turning or something.

08:21.100 --> 08:26.100
I don't know, they can't put all of us in prison. I don't know what to do.

08:26.100 --> 08:31.100
I put the guest here and there that they could come in and maybe they could give us some guidance and stuff,

08:31.100 --> 08:36.100
but you know, that one guy, whoever you are, I don't know where you tweeted or whatever,

08:36.100 --> 08:40.100
oh, I wish I missed the days when the show could go for an hour without talking about Trump.

08:40.100 --> 08:43.100
Well, why don't you suck my dick?

08:43.100 --> 08:50.100
Again, it's like, what, and then the people on the Instagram,

08:50.100 --> 08:54.100
like, I have my iPad, I play with my photo app.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.100
He's the most famous guy in the world. He's on everyone's mind.

08:57.100 --> 09:00.100
I'm going to fuck with his face and put it on a hot dog or something.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.100
It's not a fucking meme. I just think these 15-year-olds going like,

09:03.100 --> 09:07.100
dude, your meme game is weak. You're the losing side of a meme war.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.100
Motherfucker, it's called photography.

09:09.100 --> 09:13.100
So what are these people that just came into our world like larva

09:13.100 --> 09:16.100
and they just like think that every, they're just like these horrible animal people,

09:16.100 --> 09:21.100
terrible, just dumb people, just awful people with brains the size of capers.

09:21.100 --> 09:27.100
They're just like, just bad, bad people and you can't humanize them anymore.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.100
And I know you're not supposed to side with the split.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.100
You're supposed to like, we're supposed to be the good guys.

09:32.100 --> 09:35.100
We're supposed to believe, but it's just, no, you're a fucking dumbass.

09:35.100 --> 09:40.100
You're a terrible, and you make up apparently at least enough of the country,

09:40.100 --> 09:45.100
just barely enough of the country that, yeah, now this is all with your liberal tier mugs

09:45.100 --> 09:48.100
and I just like, go fuck yourself.

09:48.100 --> 09:54.100
And I was going to buy a Tesla. I was this close to retirement.

09:54.100 --> 09:59.100
I was in the zone. I was fucking sliding through, man.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.100
And they pulled you back in.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.100
It's just that, you know, everything's going to pay less.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.100
You know, I'm going to get blacklisted.

10:05.100 --> 10:08.100
You know, I'm like four years and people are going to be like having hearings

10:08.100 --> 10:13.100
or like, Mr. Harmon, do you ever consult with Mexicans?

10:13.100 --> 10:18.100
You know, I'm like, yeah, yeah, I probably do. I have that honor.

10:18.100 --> 10:22.100
I have that honor and they'll drag me away.

10:22.100 --> 10:27.100
I love my housekeeper. I love my housekeeper.

10:27.100 --> 10:34.100
I give her children my clothes.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.100
Isn't she El Salvador?

10:35.100 --> 10:37.100
We invited her to my wedding.

10:37.100 --> 10:42.100
She looked at me weird when I did, but I did.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.100
You invited her to the wedding?

10:44.100 --> 10:50.100
Erin did.

10:50.100 --> 10:54.100
I can't talk to her. I can't talk to her.

10:54.100 --> 10:59.100
Dan can't talk to her, which is great because I could talk to her.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.100
She's fine.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.100
Yeah, she's the best.

11:01.100 --> 11:04.100
We have the same housekeeper, Sophia, and she's the fucking, she's my diver.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.100
She fixes everything.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.100
Yeah, she's great.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.100
She's really good.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.100
I just, I can't, I can't, I get scared talking to her.

11:09.100 --> 11:12.100
It's not easy to talk to her, but it is quite possible.

11:12.100 --> 11:16.100
I told you what, because Dan, I mean, she speaks, she speaks very good English,

11:16.100 --> 11:18.100
but it's obviously not her first language.

11:18.100 --> 11:22.100
But she's a super badass hardworking.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.100
I told you the time about Harvey when she came over and talked about Harvey,

11:25.100 --> 11:27.100
when she first started working for you.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.100
Oh, yeah.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.100
She's on the trash, yeah.

11:29.100 --> 11:36.100
I, so look, I can't talk, people who talk quietly, people who, like,

11:36.100 --> 11:40.100
I am the guy who in every conversation is always going,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.100
What?

11:41.100 --> 11:42.100
What?

11:42.100 --> 11:43.100
What?

11:43.100 --> 11:45.100
And, like, the fifth time you say what, you feel like a dick.

11:45.100 --> 11:49.100
Like, so, then I just, like, and I'm just, like, really riddled with social anxiety.

11:49.100 --> 11:55.100
Like, I've made up my mind at some point, I guess, and go ahead and laugh it up when

11:55.100 --> 11:59.100
I say this, that I could get through this life without offending anyone.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.100
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

12:01.100 --> 12:07.100
And it's like, you're Dan Harmon, you're like a pariah, you only offend people.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.100
But that's not, I'm not trying, that's the difference.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.100
Like, I'm not trying not to.

12:12.100 --> 12:14.100
And then I'm like, I just put my foot in my mouth or whatever.

12:14.100 --> 12:17.100
And I was like, I just, I just, I'm just riddled, I'm riddled with social anxiety.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.100
I just don't want to be the bad guy.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.100
I don't want to say no to people.

12:20.100 --> 12:23.100
I don't want to, you know, that's why after the show, I just run out and I get,

12:23.100 --> 12:27.100
I get into a jet ski and I just, I just, and then I'm like, there's no water, there's no water!

12:27.100 --> 12:34.100
Because I don't want to, I don't want to, because I don't want to tell the third person

12:34.100 --> 12:37.100
that wants to get a photo after the show, after a talk for two hours, I don't want,

12:37.100 --> 12:38.100
what do you say no?

12:38.100 --> 12:39.100
What do you say no to somebody?

12:39.100 --> 12:40.100
That's crazy.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.100
You don't say no.

12:41.100 --> 12:46.100
So instead I did this rude behavior where I just fucking, I just throw down ninja balls

12:46.100 --> 12:53.100
and ninja testicles are, when they hit the floor, they emit a sound.

12:53.100 --> 12:57.100
It's the, it's the, it's the sound of the, of the ninja's heart dying.

12:57.100 --> 13:01.100
And it's so spiritually distracting that you don't notice someone running away.

13:01.100 --> 13:04.100
In the movies, they characterize it as smoke.

13:04.100 --> 13:09.100
But now people know if they want to get, get to you after the show,

13:09.100 --> 13:11.100
or just hang out by the jet ski that's out front.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.100
Yeah, well I always put it in a different place.

13:13.100 --> 13:17.100
And don't try listening for the engine, because it's solar powered.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.100
It's a Tesla jet ski.

13:20.100 --> 13:25.100
It's a Tetski.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.100
It's a Tetski.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.100
You saw Mr. Musk tweeting about it.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.100
They're here just for a select few.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.100
I'm part of a weight glove program.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.100
I'm checking it out.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.100
It's a Tetski.

13:35.100 --> 13:38.100
So you've decided against getting the Tesla now?

13:38.100 --> 13:39.100
Yeah, I just got a Tetski.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.100
You got a Tetski.

13:40.100 --> 13:43.100
No, I can't, oh look, I got my money.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.100
I'm not, I'm not a liquid man.

13:44.100 --> 13:45.100
Okay.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.100
Unlike one of the Wonder Twins.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.100
Right.

13:48.100 --> 13:53.100
Like, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I definitely, you know, money comes into the Harmon Empire.

13:53.100 --> 13:59.100
And I definitely like, I put it back out into the fields, you know, like I plant more seeds.

13:59.100 --> 14:02.100
I go like, oh, let's, let's meet with these people.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.100
And let's, let's do this out of pocket.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.100
Let's, let's start this or that.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.100
I don't know.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.100
It's just kind of like, but moreover, it's not about me being philanthropical.

14:09.100 --> 14:16.100
It's about me like, instead of taking jobs that pay, I kind of tell, well, why don't I do this project that's kind of will pay off later.

14:16.100 --> 14:21.100
So I am kind of largely what you, a rich person would call broke.

14:21.100 --> 14:30.100
I don't really look at the actual bank statements, but I just, you can see Levy's, like the blood leaves his face.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.100
He's like a thermometer.

14:31.100 --> 14:33.100
Like, like, like he looks at it.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.100
And then I'm like, how are you doing?

14:34.100 --> 14:35.100
What's going on?

14:35.100 --> 14:36.100
Pretty good.

14:36.100 --> 14:45.100
Sounds like, sounds like I'm down to 40 grand, better, better get that, better turn in one of these treatments.

14:45.100 --> 14:50.100
I learned how to write this weekend.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.100
Fucking finally.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.100
That's good news.

14:55.100 --> 15:06.100
I mean, I really, I was like, because I, you go into therapy and, and, and, and, you know, I, look, I, I've said in the past have been like, can you please help me?

15:06.100 --> 15:09.100
I don't know why I sometimes write very slowly.

15:09.100 --> 15:14.100
And, and, and, you know, it was like, well, like, like for a while.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.100
I was like, you know, just breathe.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.100
And I was like, okay, I'm breathing.

15:18.100 --> 15:24.100
And then, and then like, just like, I'll take you through a meditation and just, you know, is God a part of your writing?

15:24.100 --> 15:36.100
And I'm like, I'm like, yeah, I mean, he is, but, or she, but it's like, like, like, well, and, and she's like, well, just say to God, like, you take care of the quality.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.100
I'll take care of the quantity.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.100
And I was like, oh, okay, that's good.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.100
And then, and then I was like, yeah, take care of the quality.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.100
I'll take care of the kind.

15:43.100 --> 15:49.100
And I was like, well, that's just, you're just saying what everyone keeps saying to me, which is right faster.

15:49.100 --> 15:57.100
You just threw God under the bus and just like, so then I didn't bring it up for a couple of weeks, but then I went in because I was like really jammed up on this treatment.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.100
And I was just like, it was just torture.

15:59.100 --> 16:12.100
It was like, I have these like modes of operation where you've seen if you've, if you're a fan of mine that you, you know, I can like, I could like, you know, I'll do a thing where I'm like, oh, I'm upside down in a tank and I'm typing a screenplay.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.100
Well, there's snakes on me.

16:13.100 --> 16:18.100
And then it's like, oh, look how fast and that's pretty good for snake typing.

16:18.100 --> 16:22.100
And then also I'll collaborate with other people.

16:22.100 --> 16:32.100
That was the thing is as a community, I had to learn to collaborate with writers and then I had to let go of this terror I had of letting people see my process.

16:32.100 --> 16:39.100
And so I was explaining that to her and she said, well, are you one of these people that goes to a cafe?

16:39.100 --> 16:42.100
Because you, you know, you want to be seen writing or something?

16:42.100 --> 16:44.100
I said, you mean a hack?

16:44.100 --> 16:45.100
No, I'm not.

16:45.100 --> 16:48.100
She's like, well, I don't know if those people are hacks or not.

16:48.100 --> 16:53.100
But I was like, well, I mean, they're not, they can't be good.

16:53.100 --> 16:57.100
I like, and she's like, well, I think some people want to be seen writing.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.100
It like makes them feel like they got to keep writing or something.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.100
I'm like, okay, all right, they're not, they're the good people.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.100
But no, that's not me.

17:04.100 --> 17:06.100
I've never done that, which is interesting data.

17:06.100 --> 17:10.100
Like, and it's like, I wouldn't type next to Cody if I was on an airplane.

17:10.100 --> 17:13.100
Like, because she wouldn't be part of the process.

17:13.100 --> 17:18.100
So, but I work good with collaborators and Mr. Nimoy.

17:18.100 --> 17:22.100
And, and, and I, and I, and I, and I can do it as performance.

17:22.100 --> 17:27.100
And then I was like, oh, okay, so there's something going on here.

17:27.100 --> 17:32.100
But I use, and so she's like, so who are the people, what are the people providing?

17:32.100 --> 17:39.100
I'm like, well, you know, they let me off the hook because they're kind of like, you know, they're, they're, they're okay with whatever's going on.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.100
And she's like, you're, you see, you're performing.

17:41.100 --> 17:46.100
You can, like, everyone's looking up your skirt and they're saying, like, I like that.

17:46.100 --> 17:50.100
And I was like, okay, yeah.

17:50.100 --> 17:54.100
And she's like, and so when, and so it's these times when you say, okay, I'll go do that alone.

17:54.100 --> 17:59.100
And then I'll bring my work back that it's like, I was like, yeah, I guess it's like saying, okay, let me go away for three hours.

17:59.100 --> 18:04.100
And I'm going to really do something great under my skirt and then come back and lift it up.

18:04.100 --> 18:08.100
And, and that, and that, yeah, enough that it's like, what are you supposed to do?

18:08.100 --> 18:12.100
And she's like, yeah, see so, see so.

18:12.100 --> 18:20.100
The, the, I mean, I know you guys are going to go like, oh, that doesn't help me write it all.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.100
Well, fuck you. It's my $200.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.100
I'm just telling you what I learned.

18:25.100 --> 18:34.100
She says, she goes, well, you know, you know, tell, tell me like a, like a, like a, like a memory of you writing.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.100
And I've told you guys the story.

18:36.100 --> 18:40.100
Brother got caught playing with matches and I was with him and, and then wait till your dad gets home.

18:40.100 --> 18:43.100
And then my, my, my mom said, well, your dad's coming home.

18:43.100 --> 18:51.100
Why don't you write one of those stories you write about a boy that gets caught playing with matches and lives to regret it.

18:51.100 --> 18:55.100
And I was like, okay, good. And then I wrote the story and then I got meta.

18:55.100 --> 19:01.100
And I was like, at the end of the story of the little boy, like, write such a good story that the mom's like, oh, your dad doesn't have to spank you now.

19:01.100 --> 19:08.100
And that was the story. And I gave it to my mom and she was like, this is amazing. I don't buy the ending.

19:08.100 --> 19:18.100
And I was like, I think that's kind of like, you know, I've mythologized that story, but I do also think that that is truly, she's like, yeah, when you're working and you,

19:18.100 --> 19:24.100
and she said, so tell me about God and your work. And I said, I said, well, okay, this is going to be hard to, to explain.

19:24.100 --> 19:31.100
But it's like, you get like, there, yeah, there's a God, whatever you want to call that, it's nothingness, it's the cosmos, it's life itself, whatever.

19:31.100 --> 19:38.100
It's the Dow, it's, it's ISIS. That's what ISIS worship, right? ISIS.

19:38.100 --> 19:42.100
That's why they're called ISIS. They worship the Greek goddess, ISIS.

19:42.100 --> 19:49.100
Form of an ISIS. That'd be amazing.

19:49.100 --> 19:55.100
It's like, you could see how there would be, you know, there would be friction there with the rest of Islam. It's like, ISIS, what?

19:55.100 --> 20:00.100
Isn't that like a cat lady? All right.

20:00.100 --> 20:05.100
What are you, are you cat burglars? Is that, no, we hurt people real bad.

20:05.100 --> 20:11.100
Okay, well, and it's not funny, I guess. Well, Dan Harmon's next job is going to make it real funny.

20:11.100 --> 20:15.100
Am I going to take advice on ISIS, what was show to go to?

20:15.100 --> 20:19.100
Well, I love, love Dan Harmon's show, that's all I'm saying.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.100
Get out of here, ISIS.

20:21.100 --> 20:27.100
Everyone's a, everyone's a theater recommender.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.100
Patron.

20:29.100 --> 20:32.100
So you're talking about God.

20:32.100 --> 20:42.100
So I said, what has been my standard answer, which is you have to, you have to, you know, you have to be there. You have to put a hole in your chest.

20:42.100 --> 20:52.100
And like God comes through and because God can't write, he's like, you know.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.100
He can write on stone with lightning.

20:55.100 --> 20:59.100
Well, I mean, you gotta like bring him the stone or something.

20:59.100 --> 21:02.100
Did that happen in the Bible?

21:02.100 --> 21:07.100
But he can't like write an episode of Nash Bridges. He can't, I mean, it would take forever.

21:07.100 --> 21:14.100
Like, on the first day, Nash Bridges is making an omelet.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.100
And the fireballs are hitting the tablets.

21:16.100 --> 21:22.100
And he's like, I got to start a new tablet. I'm not even done with the master shot.

21:22.100 --> 21:26.100
The doorbell rings.

21:26.100 --> 21:30.100
God, the PAs are getting tired of walking up and down the mountain with your tablets.

21:30.100 --> 21:32.100
Can we streamline this process?

21:32.100 --> 21:42.100
You go tell them, do you want a bad show or a good one?

21:42.100 --> 21:52.100
And then God finally like, this is like, we're rolling in an hour and God goes down the hill and like David Mills just lays on the set and shouts dialogue out while the actors perform.

21:52.100 --> 22:01.100
Alright. So I said, you know, you put a hole in yourself so that God comes through.

22:01.100 --> 22:04.100
You don't want to impede it.

22:04.100 --> 22:11.100
And, you know, you want that hole as wide as possible.

22:11.100 --> 22:15.100
And like, it's going to scrape the edges of your hole.

22:15.100 --> 22:18.100
And that's your voice. That's your style, you know.

22:18.100 --> 22:23.100
But like people mistake that for meaning like, oh, you got to make that whole cookie shaped, you know.

22:23.100 --> 22:27.100
Like, I'm going to, oh, look at my indie movie.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.100
You can tell I wrote the shit out of it.

22:29.100 --> 22:32.100
And it's like, that's somebody that's like, their hole isn't circular.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.100
It's not like pure, you know.

22:34.100 --> 22:38.100
It's like, will you please let God just do his work here?

22:38.100 --> 22:42.100
He's trying to write and he can't write because he has to use tablets otherwise.

22:42.100 --> 22:45.100
That's not part of it.

22:45.100 --> 22:51.100
So she said, so what I'm hearing is this process involves the removal of your heart

22:51.100 --> 23:00.100
and that you can fuck up by being too there at the moment when God is there

23:00.100 --> 23:06.100
and like you, to the extent that he's there, you have to not be there.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.100
That's part of the process.

23:08.100 --> 23:12.100
Okay, alright. A little gotcha therapy.

23:12.100 --> 23:15.100
And she's like, so what do you think the other people are providing?

23:15.100 --> 23:18.100
Like, do you really believe in God?

23:18.100 --> 23:19.100
Do you think he created it?

23:19.100 --> 23:20.100
I said, I don't know.

23:20.100 --> 23:28.100
I believe that nothingness over infinity has 100% chance of deciding to explode into everything.

23:28.100 --> 23:31.100
Makes sense.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.100
I dropped out of college.

23:33.100 --> 23:35.100
Makes sense to me.

23:35.100 --> 23:38.100
I watched a Nova.

23:38.100 --> 23:46.100
And so I think there's an impulse to all of existence that prefers existence over non-existence.

23:46.100 --> 23:47.100
It has a tendency.

23:47.100 --> 23:53.100
I don't think you can all the way call it consciousness and yet it's so vast and we're all a part of it.

23:53.100 --> 24:00.100
Yeah, I think there's something ineffable that if you're on its side

24:00.100 --> 24:06.100
or if it sees benefit in letting you do your thing, then you have better luck.

24:06.100 --> 24:09.100
I guess you call that karma or something.

24:09.100 --> 24:13.100
Or maybe just look at it like there's a balance to the universe.

24:13.100 --> 24:18.100
So if you're out of the moment, you tend to have shitty days because you're trying too hard.

24:18.100 --> 24:22.100
And then when you're in the moment, you have those days where you feel like you're in the zone.

24:22.100 --> 24:28.100
And that's because if you surrender to nothingness, that's like Taoism.

24:28.100 --> 24:39.100
You're jamming along and you're tooting your horn and you're blowing your friends and you're just having...

24:39.100 --> 24:41.100
I was like, well, you can't blow a horn.

24:41.100 --> 24:42.100
You already chewed at that.

24:42.100 --> 24:43.100
I don't know what the...

24:43.100 --> 24:48.100
What's the list of things people do?

24:48.100 --> 24:52.100
So I'm letting you into my process.

24:52.100 --> 24:55.100
And you're telling me with your laughter, you're saying, it doesn't matter.

24:55.100 --> 24:58.100
You can fuck up and say, toot your horn, blow your friends.

24:58.100 --> 24:59.100
We like that.

24:59.100 --> 25:03.100
We like everything that you do because we know that it's happening in the moment.

25:03.100 --> 25:12.100
We like when you widen your hole so much that we don't scrape its edges.

25:12.100 --> 25:16.100
So she's like, well, don't you think that what it is...

25:16.100 --> 25:20.100
Because I was like, well, there was a time before community when I didn't know how to collaborate.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.100
And it was like, did you write then?

25:22.100 --> 25:23.100
Were you productive then?

25:23.100 --> 25:25.100
More so than after community.

25:25.100 --> 25:28.100
And I think what it was is I kind of came up with this one.

25:28.100 --> 25:29.100
I'm going to give myself credit.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.100
I was like, oh.

25:30.100 --> 25:37.100
So I think that what that means is that I lacked something that I gained from collaboration.

25:37.100 --> 25:42.100
And I didn't want to go back to writing alone because it would be like going off of heroin,

25:42.100 --> 25:44.100
back to just cold turkey.

25:44.100 --> 25:47.100
But neither thing was actually what you're supposed to be doing.

25:47.100 --> 25:50.100
You're supposed to somehow be generating this adoration.

25:50.100 --> 25:53.100
You're supposed to love yourself and self-care.

25:53.100 --> 26:00.100
You're supposed to atone with a God that actually is glad that you exist and is thankful that you are writing.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.100
It doesn't care.

26:01.100 --> 26:05.100
It doesn't think that there's any way for you to fuck up because good writer, bad writer, whatever.

26:05.100 --> 26:08.100
It's like God's like Jeff Bridges in Starman.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.100
He's just hanging out.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.100
He's going like, whoa, like Nash Bridges?

26:11.100 --> 26:13.100
That's brilliant.

26:13.100 --> 26:21.100
It was the show, so weird that that's my go-to reference.

26:21.100 --> 26:25.100
I think it's because at my WGA orientation, they went around the table and were like,

26:25.100 --> 26:27.100
tell the story of how you got to the WGA.

26:27.100 --> 26:32.100
And somebody was like, I wrote a Nash Bridges and I just always thought that was so funny.

26:32.100 --> 26:35.100
Because they worked at Nash Bridges and then someone got sick.

26:35.100 --> 26:37.100
And then they're like, I can write Nash Bridges.

26:37.100 --> 26:42.100
And I was like, this story does not reflect well on Nash Bridges.

26:42.100 --> 26:48.100
It was just like this person was like, I deliver pepper to the Nash Bridges office.

26:48.100 --> 26:52.100
And then a wheel fell on someone from the salt truck.

26:52.100 --> 26:59.100
And they said, hey, what would a detective do if he was in Texas?

26:59.100 --> 27:01.100
I don't know where Nash Bridges is.

27:01.100 --> 27:04.100
And I just drew on my pepper experience.

27:04.100 --> 27:09.100
I was like, maybe he sneezes and I want an Emmy and here I am.

27:09.100 --> 27:14.100
Now I have a dental plan and fuck the pepper industry.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.100
They act like it's an honor to work for them.

27:16.100 --> 27:24.100
I was like, Hollywood's fair.

27:24.100 --> 27:29.100
So the bottom line is, you know, and you're like, oh, I'm a Dan Harmon fan.

27:29.100 --> 27:30.100
I'm an atheist.

27:30.100 --> 27:32.100
I hate God.

27:32.100 --> 27:33.100
I hate the concept of God.

27:33.100 --> 27:34.100
I get it.

27:34.100 --> 27:35.100
You're smart.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.100
I love you.

27:36.100 --> 27:37.100
You're fine.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.100
Because I'm God.

27:38.100 --> 27:39.100
Because I believe in God.

27:39.100 --> 27:44.100
Because how would you be this special if there was nothing out there?

27:44.100 --> 27:47.100
Like, what do you think is coursing through me fucking magnets?

27:47.100 --> 27:52.100
You think I was just born on a rock that had like a weird angle to it?

27:52.100 --> 27:55.100
I've got God in me.

27:55.100 --> 27:58.100
You don't believe in it because you're like, damn, then that means he hates me.

27:58.100 --> 28:03.100
Well, be holy.

28:03.100 --> 28:08.100
You're better than thou.

28:08.100 --> 28:11.100
No, but look, I'm not.

28:11.100 --> 28:17.100
Some people get so triggered by the fucking G word that they're like, oh, Dan's like,

28:17.100 --> 28:22.100
look, I'm just saying, like, it's Tom Hanks' volleyball.

28:22.100 --> 28:25.100
It's like, you need a mythology.

28:25.100 --> 28:26.100
You're a primate.

28:26.100 --> 28:30.100
You were born with equipment that spontaneously generates mythology.

28:30.100 --> 28:36.100
It's like, why would you, I'm not saying why would you, it also generates like science.

28:36.100 --> 28:39.100
And that's like very, we need way more atheists and skeptics.

28:39.100 --> 28:42.100
And we need way more science right now than we need the other thing.

28:42.100 --> 28:47.100
But I'm just saying you do have the software and hardware in your head that you actually

28:47.100 --> 28:48.100
have to like suppress it.

28:48.100 --> 28:52.100
Like, you tend to invent shit in your head when you're looking for a parking spot.

28:52.100 --> 28:56.100
And you're like, oh man, I missed that spot because I shouldn't have been a dick to that

28:56.100 --> 28:57.100
barista.

28:57.100 --> 29:00.100
You just, you always do it.

29:00.100 --> 29:08.100
And you watch stories in movies and TV that they're all like circling around this concept

29:08.100 --> 29:12.100
that there's an order to the universe because you're a sentient monkey and it's really fucked

29:12.100 --> 29:13.100
up.

29:13.100 --> 29:16.100
We got mentally ill when we became conscious.

29:16.100 --> 29:20.100
We were just animals and we were like running around and there are other animals were eating

29:20.100 --> 29:21.100
us and we were eating them.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.100
And it was like, this is great.

29:22.100 --> 29:23.100
It's a game of monopoly.

29:23.100 --> 29:24.100
Like, who cares?

29:24.100 --> 29:25.100
It's fun.

29:25.100 --> 29:29.100
It's not fun for us because we don't have claws and we're just like getting our ass

29:29.100 --> 29:33.100
kicked because we're like, who came up with this idea of being a monkey that can't be

29:33.100 --> 29:34.600
in a tree?

29:34.600 --> 29:37.100
And then we just kind of exploded one day.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.100
Who knows?

29:38.100 --> 29:40.100
Maybe it's just your brain gets to a certain size.

29:40.100 --> 29:45.100
Maybe if you eat enough muscles, I don't know, but get enough vitamin B or something.

29:45.100 --> 29:49.100
And then we were like, whoa, I get it.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.100
You're born.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.100
And then you die.

29:51.100 --> 29:59.100
And then we looked down at the gazelle brain we were eating and we're like, oh, God, Jesus

29:59.100 --> 30:00.100
Christ.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.100
Jesus Christ.

30:01.100 --> 30:08.100
And then we calmed down enough to get through the day, but we're just like, you know, we're

30:08.100 --> 30:09.100
like, oh.

30:09.100 --> 30:15.100
See, that origin story of Jesus Christ is so much less complicated than virgin birth and

30:15.100 --> 30:16.100
wise men.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.600
People will tell you it has something to do with Jerusalem.

30:18.600 --> 30:26.600
No, it goes back to 30,000 B.C. and no, I'm just saying like, it's hard.

30:26.600 --> 30:32.180
When you watch an Eli Roth movie, the thing that you're getting high off of if you're

30:32.180 --> 30:36.420
enjoying it or the thing that's freaking you out if you're not enjoying it is that it's

30:36.420 --> 30:41.660
hitting your system as a toxicity because the signal you're getting is that nothing,

30:41.660 --> 30:48.180
you know, you can't do anything to like make bad things not happen to good people.

30:48.180 --> 30:52.060
You can't, you don't know when an eyeball is just going to fall out of a head or when

30:52.060 --> 30:58.620
a weird Czechoslovakian company is going to print business cards that allows people

30:58.620 --> 31:03.500
to be a secret Harry Potter society that blow torches people's faces.

31:03.500 --> 31:07.540
There's got to be other stuff those people can do.

31:07.540 --> 31:08.540
What are they?

31:08.540 --> 31:17.460
The lady that just wants to lay in a bath and like use a scythe on a backpacker and

31:17.460 --> 31:18.460
bathe in her blood.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.460
Like, how many times has she done that?

31:19.460 --> 31:20.460
What are you talking about?

31:20.460 --> 31:21.460
I have no idea.

31:21.460 --> 31:22.460
I fell off this train.

31:22.460 --> 31:23.460
It's one of those hostile movies.

31:23.460 --> 31:24.460
I don't know if it's hostile one or hostile two.

31:24.460 --> 31:25.460
That was like doing mescalematic.

31:25.460 --> 31:36.620
But yeah, I mean, there's a whole tub there she had built.

31:36.620 --> 31:37.620
You know that.

31:37.620 --> 31:41.420
I mean, it's like, that's pretty, how many women has she bathed in the blood of?

31:41.420 --> 31:45.340
That's got to get, like change it up.

31:45.340 --> 31:47.420
Does she think it makes her strong?

31:47.420 --> 31:48.420
Is in that movie?

31:48.420 --> 31:49.420
Is that way?

31:49.420 --> 31:51.260
There's no magic in that movie.

31:51.260 --> 31:54.060
If she could jump higher when she did it, then I'd be like, okay, well, that's what

31:54.060 --> 31:55.060
happened.

31:55.060 --> 31:56.060
Like, look how high she can jump.

31:56.060 --> 31:57.940
She doesn't want to jump lower.

31:57.940 --> 31:58.940
That's what happens.

31:58.940 --> 31:59.940
She's dependent on the blood.

31:59.940 --> 32:02.780
But I would assume that after a while she'd be like, you know, my sciatic nerve is still

32:02.780 --> 32:03.780
acting up.

32:03.780 --> 32:12.540
And no amount of this sticky gross blood that I bathe in is helping me not age.

32:12.540 --> 32:16.260
I'm going to try just yogurt and sitting at home and save 500 grand.

32:16.260 --> 32:24.460
Okay, so anyways, I'm just saying, I'm just saying life is like we are like God to us

32:24.460 --> 32:27.340
like when he doesn't exist is like Eli Roth.

32:27.340 --> 32:30.180
Like it's like, it's like, oh, we're in the hands of a maniac.

32:30.180 --> 32:35.180
Like, a log could fall on my caveman friend and then it's like not his fault, it's not

32:35.180 --> 32:36.180
my fault.

32:36.180 --> 32:37.460
And it's like, oh man, I just fell in love.

32:37.460 --> 32:41.780
Oh, now I feel a lump and like, like, oh, now it's like a tiger to eat my baby.

32:41.780 --> 32:45.300
Like, like, like, like, you just, you just run it and also all the shitty things that

32:45.300 --> 32:46.300
you do.

32:46.300 --> 32:49.740
You're like, oh, I killed the tiger for killing my baby and now the tiger likes its heart

32:49.740 --> 32:50.740
looks like my heart.

32:50.740 --> 32:51.740
And like, I can't take it.

32:51.740 --> 32:52.740
I can't take it.

32:52.740 --> 32:55.260
There's no cocaine or invented yet.

32:55.260 --> 32:56.500
I can't like deal with this.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.500
I got to go.

32:57.500 --> 32:58.500
I'm just running around my cave.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.500
I'm going to freak out.

32:59.500 --> 33:00.500
Freaking out.

33:00.500 --> 33:06.460
And I need some coke to calm the calm down a little bit.

33:06.460 --> 33:10.260
And so then some smarty pants caveman was like, you know, like, well, look, here's the thing.

33:10.260 --> 33:14.660
I mean, look, you know, when that thunder happens, that's angels bowling.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.660
And the guy's like, go on, go on.

33:16.660 --> 33:20.140
Are you singing my tune?

33:20.140 --> 33:21.740
That tiger killed your baby.

33:21.740 --> 33:23.940
You got baby points.

33:23.940 --> 33:29.700
You're going to get those back later when you become a tiger in the next life.

33:29.700 --> 33:32.540
And the angels are going to bowl with me.

33:32.540 --> 33:37.380
No, that's just an ancillary cosmology that sounds like the angels just bowl like they

33:37.380 --> 33:39.260
don't even know what the fuck's going on.

33:39.260 --> 33:40.260
Okay.

33:40.260 --> 33:41.260
You just you're explaining thunder.

33:41.260 --> 33:42.260
Yeah.

33:42.260 --> 33:43.820
Don't let the thunder freak you out.

33:43.820 --> 33:47.940
You focus on your tiger points.

33:47.940 --> 33:52.780
Where do you redeem your tiger baby points in the afterlife or in this in this life?

33:52.780 --> 33:59.900
You go to confession and you say, I bless you father caveman for I had I had bad I had

33:59.900 --> 34:01.580
bad tigerless thoughts.

34:01.580 --> 34:05.100
I have two tiger points and one baby point.

34:05.100 --> 34:08.940
And then the father caveman says like, well, you might as well just say one tiger point

34:08.940 --> 34:11.940
because a baby point is the opposite of a tiger point.

34:11.940 --> 34:12.940
Okay.

34:12.940 --> 34:17.420
I heard I've been told that but you're you're you're you're ruling class doesn't let us

34:17.420 --> 34:18.420
learn math.

34:18.420 --> 34:20.780
So, well, there's a reason for that.

34:20.780 --> 34:24.260
We don't want everybody just starting a random religion about every animal they see.

34:24.260 --> 34:29.020
You're going to keep this fucking shit under your cave hat.

34:29.020 --> 34:31.100
I understand.

34:31.100 --> 34:36.820
All right, well, I can't we haven't invented hinges or slides or knobs yet.

34:36.820 --> 34:39.380
So we're just sitting in a rock.

34:39.380 --> 34:42.260
It's not like we're in a booth.

34:42.260 --> 34:44.100
So why are you telling me that?

34:44.100 --> 34:45.100
I don't know.

34:45.100 --> 34:50.900
I just I start to I guess I'm feeling like plagued with guilt being a caveman priest.

34:50.900 --> 34:52.420
Like I don't I don't hunt.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.060
I don't provide any food.

34:54.060 --> 34:57.980
Why are you unloading who's confessing here?

34:57.980 --> 34:59.780
Why are you laying this on me?

34:59.780 --> 35:00.780
I don't even know math.

35:00.780 --> 35:01.780
I'm a caveman.

35:01.780 --> 35:03.980
See now I'm going to start a religion.

35:03.980 --> 35:15.700
You protested piece of shit anyway, and that caveman name was Martin Luther's stone.

35:15.700 --> 35:26.220
It's still a junior to you know, okay, senior Martin Luther's senior.

35:26.220 --> 35:27.220
Remember the Flintstones trailer?

35:27.220 --> 35:28.220
No, you don't.

35:28.220 --> 35:29.220
You're 11.

35:29.220 --> 35:33.700
There's a Flintstones trailer and then it was like I said Steven Spielrock presents

35:33.700 --> 35:34.700
Spielrock.

35:34.700 --> 35:35.700
Yeah.

35:35.700 --> 35:36.700
It's a piss up a rope.

35:36.700 --> 35:39.700
What are you doing?

35:39.700 --> 35:40.700
Spielrock.

35:40.700 --> 35:41.700
Yeah.

35:41.700 --> 35:49.180
They didn't want to say Stoneburg to Jewish, I guess like I would say like it like it like

35:49.180 --> 35:54.300
shines a light on the they're like are you making a no because there probably is an actual

35:54.300 --> 35:56.820
director named Steven Stoneburg, right?

35:56.820 --> 36:06.980
There's that yeah, you've got away with such hack shit back then the not the Flintstones

36:06.980 --> 36:13.860
movie the Flint the show when every show that you see in reruns it was all like it was all

36:13.860 --> 36:17.420
based on some like they took like a character who was like a comic back then it would be

36:17.420 --> 36:21.940
they would just rip off their act and like draw make him an animal fucking like a bunch

36:21.940 --> 36:22.940
of hacks.

36:22.940 --> 36:32.020
Oh that Phil Silvers is really funny why don't we just make him a dolphin and I don't know

36:32.020 --> 36:35.700
what I'm talking about Phil Silvers was on everything him and Don Adams were in every

36:35.700 --> 36:39.740
cartoon in some form or other yeah they also you know those comics they got jobs and playing

36:39.740 --> 36:45.380
those voices yeah yeah who played the great Gazoo is a little dumb dumb was it Harvey

36:45.380 --> 36:52.900
Corman yeah yeah Harvey Cytel yeah after a after a while the Flintstones ran out of

36:52.900 --> 37:00.660
gas a little bit I guess they I guess they didn't expect it to run as long as it did

37:00.660 --> 37:06.100
because gas hadn't been invented because not enough dinosaurs had died to create gas

37:06.100 --> 37:13.980
so they added a fucking alien that granted wishes yeah to just be alive back then like

37:13.980 --> 37:19.660
I just just yeah I don't know but you know but none of us could have jobs you know it's

37:19.660 --> 37:24.100
like it was it was less less television less power than consolidated I would have been just

37:24.100 --> 37:28.060
like what would I what would I have been I would have been a I think I would have been

37:28.060 --> 37:39.140
a welder because I lived I was born in Milwaukee I would have been a welder and I would make

37:39.140 --> 37:43.940
like shitty sculpture in the backyard and people would be like what are you doing trying

37:43.940 --> 37:55.940
to get out of Milwaukee leaving alone just welding a bicycle rim to a ashtray I'm welding

37:55.940 --> 38:01.140
it I'm welding a sculpture to prove to my mom that I I've learned my lesson about playing

38:01.140 --> 38:09.220
with matches right all right so so I said I says to the therapist I says that's how

38:09.220 --> 38:13.660
it works and she says well just be there and let the God hit you in the back and go into

38:13.660 --> 38:17.820
your body and then you'd be like whoo it's fun to write if you if you suck or you're

38:17.820 --> 38:33.420
slow I was like you're right so I can I don't write now the long and winding road Spencer

38:33.420 --> 38:44.740
what's going on in politics oh let me tell you Spencer politics corner all right you

38:44.740 --> 38:54.060
guys hear about this tower fire in London town yeah it was a while ago that happened

38:54.060 --> 39:00.820
oh boy it was a real mess health and safety is a big part of governmental responsibility

39:00.820 --> 39:08.780
towards society and they really did not hold up their end of the bargain and you see the

39:08.780 --> 39:15.020
results of that and it was very tragic and man it makes you wonder what it what you think

39:15.020 --> 39:26.900
when people aren't valuing the safety of the American people so flaw capitalism that was

39:26.900 --> 39:33.060
the end of Spencer's politics I really deliver capitalism needs to be it's a great system

39:33.060 --> 39:40.020
it's worked very well it needs to be augmented as in all of your pocket apps with a additional

39:40.020 --> 39:47.780
mana currency right something about the app store not just something you can generate internally

39:47.780 --> 39:52.460
because then you can cheat at the game you don't have to pay anything right I recommend

39:52.460 --> 39:58.180
flogging I think we should flog ourselves you know you can you you can I don't know in

39:58.180 --> 40:04.700
a way those crystals those that that alternate currency is political influence isn't it yeah

40:04.700 --> 40:15.060
yeah high right now man what you hi no way man before a show no that's not professional

40:15.060 --> 40:19.900
I thought I thought I would get a laugh if I asked so it's like no I mean I'm chasing

40:19.900 --> 40:24.140
the dragon called laughs it's too real is there an episode Spencer you could think back to

40:24.140 --> 40:28.900
or point back to you what you think we use the highest you've ever been oh yeah I would

40:28.900 --> 40:39.420
easily say 224 enter the dragon for real are you joking February 24th no 224 enter the

40:39.420 --> 40:47.740
dragon okay yeah Ang Bak was there who was Ang Bak he wasn't in enter the dragon but he

40:47.740 --> 40:58.380
was a hero from martial arts films I think this fuckers hi why are you trying to ask

40:58.380 --> 41:05.860
me to remember an episode in which I was high yeah this flaw logic there I guess yeah and

41:05.860 --> 41:12.940
I feel like on that count I delivered reasonably well I'm not it's fine you guys are fine yeah

41:12.940 --> 41:18.940
you're more than living up to your side of the bargain audience the drunkest show had

41:18.940 --> 41:24.540
to be Nashville maybe for you oh yeah yeah and then for me probably San Francisco towards

41:24.540 --> 41:29.940
the end of that tour I don't remember being in San Francisco for that show yeah I was

41:29.940 --> 41:47.740
just tits up during that one yeah therapist gets in on me you know she's trying she's

41:47.740 --> 41:52.780
trying to she brings up the drinking like like you know like she knows she can tell she does

41:52.780 --> 41:58.180
by the way I told you this didn't I like she keeps she she she uses family guy as a as

41:58.180 --> 42:03.380
a reference yeah deal breaker the second time she did it I said she's like it's like with

42:03.380 --> 42:13.380
Peter you know the episode where he's got the thing I said therapist if you if you use

42:13.380 --> 42:22.060
the family guy as common ground to Tonka me about our feelings I'm gonna need a second

42:22.060 --> 42:33.700
therapist like and as I have a cartoon you could watch and and she said I saw I saw an

42:33.700 --> 42:41.540
episode of it somebody was puking everywhere what are you my mother but she knows she knows

42:41.540 --> 42:45.100
she knows the minute that I would come in and she'd be like well how's your date by

42:45.100 --> 42:52.740
the way first thing I gotta say I spent the weekend watching Rick and Morty that show

42:52.740 --> 42:59.660
is amazing it'd be like three weeks later I'd be like gone it's like there is something

42:59.660 --> 43:03.700
sick about I think she knows that she sees a lot of writers and people working TV and

43:03.700 --> 43:07.580
stuff so I think she knows I don't know if she I don't I don't think she's lying when

43:07.580 --> 43:10.940
she says she's only seen one episode I think she's just like I'm not gonna want I'm not

43:10.940 --> 43:16.620
gonna become a fan of this windbag you know because he all is because his whole all his

43:16.620 --> 43:23.020
problems stem from his ability to like manipulate and control that's all that's a total sacrificing

43:23.020 --> 43:26.740
of the status that she needs to have in that room needs to yeah she needs to be formidable

43:26.740 --> 43:30.900
for me to listen to her about I tried to watch family guy three times because people kept

43:30.900 --> 43:38.060
telling me how good it is that's show sucks it's not funny it's not you can see every

43:38.060 --> 43:43.260
joke coming a mile away it's so I've never seen a frame of it so I'm out of this conversation

43:43.260 --> 43:51.060
frame I don't I don't want any feuds it's the Toby Keith's of animation I'm just all

43:51.060 --> 43:54.900
I'll say is I've heard about the show I know if I have lots of people that worked on it

43:54.900 --> 43:58.900
and I know that that your objection to Rick and Morty can't be a guy was puking I've

43:58.900 --> 44:04.460
heard that people I've got people fuck horses on that show and stuff yeah people even puke

44:04.460 --> 44:09.940
on that show Rob Schrab's been sending me those little voice messages you could do an

44:09.940 --> 44:16.300
I messages and their impressions of Peter Griffin they're like hey Spencer it's me

44:16.300 --> 44:22.060
and it's just like he's just say I hope you have a good morning can you play one on your

44:22.060 --> 44:30.380
phone do you have any handy let me see yeah stretch stretch that's a whole show what is

44:30.380 --> 44:41.140
it I really need you to cover for me I was listening to Daft Punk today well I was writing

44:41.140 --> 44:44.180
with Mike McMahon who is that we were working on this treatment that we've been spending

44:44.180 --> 44:48.420
all this time on it Daft Punk was on he likes Daft Punk I don't know anything about Daft

44:48.420 --> 44:56.500
Punk and it was and it was an album like they just I don't know how recent it is but they

44:56.500 --> 45:00.580
did an album that was kind of like a fan them making music with fans or something like that

45:00.580 --> 45:05.420
so there's like and there's an interview on the album with like a guy who invented the

45:05.420 --> 45:09.620
drum machine or the metronome or something like that there's a guy there's a guy talking

45:09.620 --> 45:15.780
and I there was that but that's not how this conversation happened there was a there was

45:15.780 --> 45:20.740
a song where someone was like singing in robot voice they were going like everybody that's

45:20.740 --> 45:23.820
not a robot you can't do an impression of robot that was Michael McDonald from the

45:23.820 --> 45:32.140
previous yeah I thought I could just do an impression of yeah I but but you know that

45:32.140 --> 45:37.900
robot voice like not share auto-tune voice but just like take me to Funky Town robot voice

45:37.900 --> 45:51.180
like like size old-school Cylons kids I will make you 40 before I'm 50 and then I'm gonna

45:51.180 --> 45:55.820
retire and you're gonna take over and I'm gonna be I'm gonna be fucking I'm gonna be

45:55.820 --> 46:07.900
in the Caimans just counting my Michael Jackson chimp movie money hundred dollars from Netflix

46:07.900 --> 46:15.860
I really got a iron grip on this industry I'm sure they pay very fairly I haven't closed

46:15.860 --> 46:21.100
my deal I spent so do you have it I think you let's try to finish my story cuz I'll

46:21.100 --> 46:25.660
never all right well I'm gonna lose it though I'm story let's put an air quotes it's more

46:25.660 --> 46:30.060
of a slice of life can you catch me up yeah yeah I was listening to Daft Punk and there

46:30.060 --> 46:34.020
was a robot voice all right not being that familiar with Daft Punk I was like is that

46:34.020 --> 46:38.780
is that is the person singing in the robot filter is that the is that the Daft Punk

46:38.780 --> 46:43.700
man is he like is is is there like a lead singer and does he does he do a lot of robot

46:43.700 --> 46:52.500
singing and and and Mike said no no it's like a guest guest vocalist like they're you know

46:52.500 --> 46:59.260
largely a instrumental group and but and they're French so I don't think they would want to

46:59.260 --> 47:05.900
sing because then they it would just sound weird cuz they'd be like you must listen to

47:05.900 --> 47:14.500
the robots and I thought that was really funny you must listen to the robots as I wrote it

47:14.500 --> 47:22.020
down and fuck you I knew it wasn't gonna lay I knew I was like I wanted to share it like

47:22.020 --> 47:29.260
that I didn't expect you to laugh it's a little laugh it's a little glimpse into your day it's

47:29.260 --> 47:33.740
a nice moment we had there was there's you need to listen to the robots it's funny you

47:33.740 --> 47:41.980
know you don't think about how that how antithetical French stuff is to robot stuff it's not like

47:41.980 --> 47:44.780
something you think about but then you go like yeah you know that's not near each other

47:44.780 --> 47:50.820
on the color wheel no good reason it's just kind of funny the idea of a French robot or

47:50.820 --> 47:54.980
a French French robotics I'm sure they're very capable as you see that thing of course

47:54.980 --> 47:58.780
you said I think about the one of the Afghani girl robotics team that couldn't get in the

47:58.780 --> 48:04.340
country yeah bullshit I mean could you could you feel like somebody go down there with

48:04.340 --> 48:09.540
a briefcase and be like oops like like you pass like they're not even concerned about

48:09.540 --> 48:15.300
the PR thing then be concerned you just turned away the what a bunch of people that were

48:15.300 --> 48:21.180
like oh I know why I'm not you know gonna cause any trouble it's because I fucking I

48:21.180 --> 48:25.620
don't want to be in the world of technology and all this shit literally no back to back

48:25.620 --> 48:29.780
to Afghanistan with you but but but one thing has changed about you on this trip you now

48:29.780 --> 48:37.780
hate America so do what you will with your robotics skills which are now part of a rogue

48:37.780 --> 48:45.900
state and if your angle is that that we don't want Afghani robot robot ladies here because

48:45.900 --> 48:52.260
they're against the American way we are a nazi put us on the moon like I don't understand

48:52.260 --> 49:00.780
what is what is what is what is the mentality I don't understand what are you what do you

49:00.780 --> 49:08.500
think what we got a new remix coming next week do we have the guy's remix I think it

49:08.500 --> 49:13.500

50:06.580 --> 50:16.580
now you are proud of your race right I'm hearing you say yes the reason you're proud of your

50:16.580 --> 50:24.060
race is because it's better than other races right okay great who cares why I don't know

off of your body and and put in the mail to the government like just realize that what

51:06.340 --> 51:10.780
you think is being proud of your race is you actually being proud of being poor and proud

51:10.780 --> 51:16.100
of being a working class person and then look around you and understand that you're wrong

51:16.100 --> 51:22.420

51:31.940 --> 51:37.020
nobody's nobody wants your pants you don't even have any you don't have anything that's

51:37.020 --> 51:43.740

51:43.740 --> 51:49.180
how these people work and you can Google it you can look back they don't help the working

51:49.180 --> 51:53.840
man they don't do it they don't turn around and go thank you so much thank you for helping

your money they never do that last part they never make it rain on racists they just like

52:07.500 --> 52:12.580
fucking they go secretly have sex with exotic women and some dungeon somewhere and while

52:12.580 --> 52:17.740
they spend all of your labor doing wars that won't work because all they really want is

52:17.740 --> 52:22.780
to justify their own emergency like they just gonna they like like like Donald Trump knows

52:22.780 --> 52:26.500
that everywhere he goes things start falling apart and he knows when things start falling

52:26.500 --> 52:31.180
apart you have to you start making rules go out the window so he's like and he doesn't

52:31.180 --> 52:35.540
understand rules so he's just gonna stand in the middle of America and go like here

52:35.540 --> 52:40.140
I am and he's just like way he can hear it buckling he loves it and we keep going you're

52:40.140 --> 52:46.820
making it buckle and he's like nah he knows he is he loves it he's never gonna be shamed

52:46.820 --> 52:56.100
into submission someone go arrest him all right go go arrest him or don't I'm 44 I live

52:56.100 --> 53:03.220

53:08.700 --> 53:14.820
what you're a you're a racist okay that's like a weird turn I that went when I get

53:14.820 --> 53:19.420
a test you lost a little high ground on that one yeah I'm saying like like like like look

53:19.420 --> 53:24.500
I could put on a red cap and just vanish into the woodwork and be like yay Nazis I love

53:24.500 --> 53:31.340
it like I'm not doing it cuz I'm cool like Alec Baldwin no I'm not doing it the reason

53:31.340 --> 53:35.620
I'm not doing it is because I know I got a big mouth and I'm gonna be dead but I'll just

53:35.620 --> 53:43.580
say this and then the racist can stop listening I got a gun like stop saying shit in my Instagram

53:43.580 --> 53:48.740

53:48.740 --> 54:03.340
me and I got a gun like like just you know maybe maybe don't maybe don't put that hook

54:03.340 --> 54:12.020
in the water and how much how much water did you say you have and you and it's just the

54:12.020 --> 54:17.020
one gun right but I've been watching I think I'm gonna be okay in a racist siege of my

54:17.020 --> 54:23.620
home cuz I I I've been watching like these Jan Michael Vincent movies like defiance you

54:23.620 --> 54:27.260
just put nails and boards underneath all the windows and then when they come in they're

54:27.260 --> 54:32.140
like ow it's kind of like home alone it's the original defiance is the original home

54:32.140 --> 54:57.940
alone it's like give us a bit of that remix back takes a while to get going we're getting

54:57.940 --> 55:27.900
down there here it is because we made that Zach

55:27.900 --> 55:33.580
was fine I'll tweet it out I think or ash or something by the way that's what the Russia

55:33.580 --> 55:39.540
thing is are we not nobody's talking about that isn't the Russia thing it's like a what

55:39.540 --> 55:43.820
it's like a white country right that's like the unspoken thing like that's why everyone's

55:43.820 --> 55:49.420
like who cares if they're the people on the bad unspoken it's like a Eurasian identity

55:49.420 --> 55:55.940
thing the Russians are the true Eurasians yeah there's that stuff's out there yeah like

55:55.940 --> 56:01.700
that's yeah it's like it's like oh yeah I mean it's like man all right let's just do

56:01.700 --> 56:16.980
it let's dance yeah white people can't dance civil war with drones toys are us drones there's

56:16.980 --> 56:22.300
gonna be like fucking hand grenades falling off under your roof somebody's drone and you're

56:22.300 --> 56:30.980
gonna be like that sounds like a that sounds like a Rick and Morty drone from top topic

56:30.980 --> 56:36.500
that's got a range of 30 meters split up and cover the area people are gonna be brothers

56:36.500 --> 56:51.020
killing brothers for what for some memes for some dank memes I hope they were real dank

56:51.020 --> 57:01.860
how dank do you think your memes currently are they're not memes and I'm a hobbyist photo

57:01.860 --> 57:10.980
editor I bought an iPad 10.5 inch pro with pro motion technology embedded in the glass

57:10.980 --> 57:21.540
that has a variable refresh rate variable it's not like random like what are you caught

57:21.540 --> 57:26.580
not the other word for variable that means like adjustable well it you know selective

57:26.580 --> 57:33.060
I think it's might be selective variable systematic system that was that was a that was way too

57:33.060 --> 57:39.060
much confidence for that guess it wasn't it wasn't a bad guess but it was that was so

57:39.060 --> 57:50.380
confident for just like really it's just like a thing system applesauce it was an okay guess

57:50.380 --> 57:55.100
you should have said at this lab systematic and you should have you should have you should

57:55.100 --> 58:03.500
have a handle on the on like systematic I don't know that was it was worth systematic

58:03.500 --> 58:23.060
I've got it and handle this I mean everything is systematic that's except love who's that

58:23.060 --> 58:26.980
guy what's that guy doing what was that guy what's he doing Spencer Spencer you got the

58:26.980 --> 58:31.700

him to be here tonight yeah but remember when Norman Lear was here whew was Rob misbehaving

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:40.700
during Norman Lear he was great it'd be great for anybody to be here you know I'm on fire

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:48.260
but how much more can I burn how much God can I let through me let's see let's find

01:00:48.260 --> 01:01:04.980
out but you you you sing you want God to pass through you but then you also told us earlier

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.820
that you are God so how does what do you think happens when God passes through you and what

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:13.140
was my therapy story about it's I'm saying I used to let God go through the hole now

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:21.700
God comes in he don't get out you're like you're like a roach motel for God yeah well

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:28.140
I caught God like a leprechaun and I wished for the gold of good writing but does God

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:33.420
want to get out he probably wants to get out he might miss his old life from time to time

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:46.740
but you know he he he wanted to see what it's like to be me so yeah you know I'm so like

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:52.660
like like what I can't I can't I can't let him out I'm not God I thought you are God

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:59.860
now that God's inside you yeah but he's trapped I'm saying I can't it gives nothing I can

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:04.340
do about it yeah you're God you just don't want God to get up and he's not gonna be God

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:07.580
anymore and then you're gonna go shit I should have kept God in there and you know that God's

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.180
not coming back in you when you let him out you're like that fucker kept me in there for

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:16.300
like four weeks you're making me sound like the devil now as if but you're making it sound

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:22.100
like I really tricked God because I was really the devil and now I trapped him and now I

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:27.980
have all God's power and I'm actually the devil here on earth right to woo people with

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:37.260
my liberal virtue signaling into an anti-Christ movement that appears on its face to be a

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:43.980
holy cult that's how I get you and then you have the number Harmon on your head and then

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:55.500
it's like doomsday and it turns out Trump was Christ think about it like would you would

01:02:55.500 --> 01:03:00.340
you if you were the anti-Christ would you come back as a person who looked exactly like

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:05.220
the anti-Christ and acted like him as it's Jesus has come back in the form of Donald

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:11.860
Trump and because he's again he he's we're literally going to crucify him but you need

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:20.180
a reason I don't know it's a working theory I I had another theory that he's what he's

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:25.740
it's we're in a state we're in his dream because he's just like he's the only he's like we're

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.780
all just like we just took us this long to start realizing like because he's about to

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:35.540
die and his dream will of old age and and and like his dreams going to be over good

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:40.740
safe good safe and so and so it's like it's kind of like the end the the whole end of

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.500
everything like where it's like coalescing like like we walked around thinking we're

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.500
a part of this like regular world but we didn't know we were just like in the we're in a

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:55.300
Jacob's ladder scenario yeah I guess so but we're all Macaulay Culkin oh yeah we're back

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:59.500
to home alone we're back on home alone again what's going on he's in Jacob's ladder okay

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:05.620
I don't want to spoil Jacob's ladder but Macaulay Culkin's in it sounds like a joke but he is

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:13.300
if I tell you who he is it's kind of a spoiler because he's Tim Robin's dead son that sounds

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:19.700
a lot like a spoiler yeah it sounds a lot like it yeah where is our Macaulay Culkin

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:25.380
is he doing all right I don't I think he I think he would say yes but I think like objective

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:31.180
reports are that he seems like he he's not well right that he's if you see him out that

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:39.980
he's you know he could use a hug and maybe like some broccoli but you know who hangs

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:44.140
out with him Seth Green oh yeah we could have Seth on and we could ask him how's Macaulay

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:51.700
doing we could have Macaulay on probably bring us some broccoli hug the shit out of him

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:57.660
but when Macaulay comes we're gonna put boards with nails under all the windows fucking get

01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:03.860
that guy you guys saw the theory online that Macaulay Culkin's character in home alone

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:13.620
grows up to become jigsaw it's pretty well thought out the time works where it works

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:20.860
really well that he like gets a taste for human trapping and wait the timeline works

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:27.900
pretty well I think so in that home alone happened before saw movies I can tell from

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:31.620
the tone of your voice that you're about to prove me wrong so no I just think that's

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:39.260
very sound if you're saying that home before you're sarcastically high-fiving me I don't

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:44.460
you know I'm not gonna comment on your commenting because it might be right or it might be wrong

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:50.700
but you're saying of course the timing works one movie is set well yeah well one kid and

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:57.980
then presumably jigsaw is older so yeah that works out perfectly how would it not how would

01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:06.380
that not work stay down Dan stay down because you clearly haven't seen the soft franchise

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:10.220
they fuck with the unlinear storytelling a lot there's a lot of flashbacks to like he

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:17.540
works in a soup kitchen in the 80s or something so maybe it doesn't work so there oh okay but

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:30.580
then there's that flash forward in home alone three where he's working at that soup kitchen

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:37.340
what is that what does that talk boy say what's the filthy kids oh hey kids we're home early

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:42.940
that's the only one I remember someone says that it's in the I think it's one of the one

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:49.020
of the bandits says that no the talk boy right the talk boy says hey kids we're home early

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:53.620
in the commercial he goes hey kids we're home early and then he pitches it down and it goes

01:06:53.620 --> 01:07:00.340
hey kids we're home early and then the boyfriend he gets uncomfortable because he was getting

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:06.220
a little close you know oh so in the commercial parents were coming home little kid using

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:12.420
it to freak out yeah teenage yeah sounds like the slut shamed sister yeah it is well it's

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:19.900
not her fault it's his fault it's 9-11 9-11 really wow remember that video we saw you

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:25.420
know it's hot in Burbank but only a part of the audience cheers for 9-11 I hope it's hotter

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.820
up here than it is down there but probably not you guys Diana I'm under lights but you

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:34.620
guys are it's not great it's mostly so still roaches kind of like on top of each other

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:39.980
do you know wrote you know roaches love the they there is some word for it they love they're

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:44.580
more comfortable when they're on top of each other that's nice they're like kind of like

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:48.900
when you see a lone roach you're seeing a roach that is like stressed out that feels the way

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:54.980
you feel when you see a roach it's like it's like it's like a woody Allen roach that's

01:07:54.980 --> 01:08:02.740
like I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing that was a terrible your roaches an older Jewish

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:10.500
man from New York well isn't he an answer something yeah but who can't do a woody Allen impression

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.580
I guess me it's pretty interesting to find out try again try again wait hold on let's

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:21.300
go to a break and on the break we cut out your attempt all right well let's go to a break

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:27.460
though a word from one of our sponsors that you don't have to listen to if you paid $5

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:34.060
a month right and I'm going to show you some special things and if you didn't pay $5 you

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:39.140
can fast forward like everybody else no wait what was your impression though the pressure

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:44.540
was going to be special yeah well let's not deal with it okay Dan what are you doing Dan's

01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:49.900
going to his iPad we really are taking a break well the thing is this isn't actually going

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:53.900
to get down to the point is not to take a break from the paying people that came here

01:08:53.900 --> 01:09:00.380
to the show these people are actually still human beings that are sweating in front of

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:09.180
us I can't figure out how to do a mid-roll break that was pretty good that was good

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:29.260

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:52.500
where I spent a long time look at this like I made like yeah isn't that creepy it's almost

01:09:52.500 --> 01:10:02.940
as creepy as this I think this might be a new hobby or fetish of my like erasing people's

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.420
faces and just like like and like trying to nail the like like what their head would look

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:12.580

I accidentally found because I'm into like pantyhose and tights and things and I I stumbled

01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:08.100
into this this this with this new branch of porn and sometimes I think it's driven by

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:12.260
effect if you're like writing in a deadline I found that Cody has found this too because

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:16.620
she was like she's writing it off she's in self-imposed like retreat right now writing

01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:20.860

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:54.060
whole like it's it's strap-on the it's lesbian strap-on porn like it's like starts with like

01:12:54.060 --> 01:13:01.020
two women in pantyhose and then one of one of them puts a but it's not it's strapless

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:07.140
strap-on because there's a little thing there's a little dildo part that goes into the vagina

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:18.700
of the woman that's gonna do the the the fucking the endowment the investment oh and and and

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:24.100
but this is like and then they and then they do it like with the with the dildo but then

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:30.020
also a lot of them they have like a money shot because they have like a it's like a special

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:35.340
effect dildo and then the woman pulls out and like since I guess since they know you

01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:40.900
know it's fake they they they can just go with a copious amounts so it's like a like

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:47.420
a weird art piece and it's just like slow motion wait there's there's fake semen inside

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:56.420
the strap the strap of the strap on try to keep up and how do they what's the trigger

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:59.700
system on that how do I don't know what's happened I don't know if it's like they do

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:03.500
this with guy you ever see like regular porn like where it's like oh wait that's a fake

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:08.580
come shot this like I don't know if they they do like maybe the guy has like a tube under

01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:11.300
the dick or something and they'll like cut to a different angle and then the guy'll

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:19.060
be like oh and then like all this like cake batter will just fly out it's just like well

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:23.380
that doesn't really I mean you're you jump the shark here like it doesn't really you

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:29.820
should if you just did that but choked up on the bat like I don't know but I don't know

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:34.260
it's interesting like when there's like women like like like beautiful women in there in

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:39.060
there and then there it's high def and then there I don't know I got like eight or nine

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:45.780
videos now that are like wow I feel so cosmopolitan I'm kind of into like lesbian strap on action

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:54.580
yeah with a with a with a crazy rick baker special effect come shot that is so cosmopolitan

01:14:54.580 --> 01:15:01.380
of you I love that I feel like I should I should I should I should drink a mojito and

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:11.220
listen to NPR and we're bad for public radio I am so is there is there a what's the what's

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:21.100
the handle for that I felt I find it ironic that I felt just a little bit of judgment

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:26.940
from you but you're writing this down the cap is on my pen you can't wait to hear this

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:33.300
because you want to know I'm just curious hot to you admit it sounds okay sounds hot

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:41.460
yeah it had me I don't know about the Rick Hums the Rick the Rick Baker I'm watching it

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:46.260
on porn hub the thing in the corner I'm trying to remember it says like Rick rick Baker come

01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:56.940
shot sure it it says I think I want to say strapless dildo dot com so there's feel feel

01:15:56.940 --> 01:16:14.300
dough is the name of the of what those things are right field though field though I guess

01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:17.820
because you could feel it while you're doing because as opposed to a strap on that's just

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:24.820
like yeah right it makes sense it's kind it's you know like hey it's progressive it sounds

01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:32.740
like potentially everyone's a winner yeah everyone's a wiener everyone has a wiener

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:42.540
inside them everyone is a win everyone I'm gonna get back to you on this one it's not

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:53.980
about whether you wiener lose nice it's how you play the game that wasn't that good let's

01:16:53.980 --> 01:17:14.380
bring Steve Levy up to the stage Steve Levy hey what was that he's just farted what was

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:20.940
that wasn't from me he's gonna blame the chair but it was he clearly farted when he came on

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:26.780
stage do we have playback on that I think that was from the audience sound like a chair

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:35.780
that was squeaking well no it didn't it sounded like a funny playful fart but I can use honestly

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:45.980

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:13.820
never had a drink in my life what's really yeah I thought you knew that I don't I guess

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:19.100
that in my life like you're like super yeah but also Steve's one of those people that

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:30.180
thinks butt chugging doesn't count I've never but in college in college I have friends who

01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:36.500
always threatened to get me basted which is where they they take vodka in a turkey baster

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:42.580
and you shove it up your ass and squeeze it out wow and get drunk really fast apparently

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:51.820
yeah also you find out who your friends aren't or are they also make one where the turkey

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:55.700
baster goes inside your your your butts and then you put it in somebody else's butt it's

01:18:55.700 --> 01:19:00.060
called I always heard you said that's called feel stir I heard I always heard that that's

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:11.900
called a slow thanksgiving it's like it's like slow news day slow thanksgiving

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:20.300
conversation sort of hit a low with that vodka that's a thing that's fucking wow yeah basting

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:24.020
is that what you're well again as a thing I'm welling that I wonder who's doing that

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:28.180
like oh the idea it's youth because they're saying like whoa it's all about the thrill

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:32.060
I'm like the Chuck Jagger of getting drunk you also don't need that much and it gets

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:36.420
it gets your drunk yeah I mean so oh you don't need that much like I'm sure the college kids

01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:41.260
doing this aren't our support system I think it was more a problem in high schools right

01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:45.860
and how is it different than butt chugging it's the same I think you can you don't have

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:52.340
to do like a handstand I guess you can just you have the apparatus to go squeeze squeeze

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:57.500
it just desired amount of vodka inside you yeah and I thought it was clever getting basted

01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:07.140
it sounds great this is amazing that I didn't have friendships like that where it was like

01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:11.540
that like okay put this in my butt like I'm not saying I'm not trying to be home well you

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:17.220
have a very intimate like like like like at an age when you're most defensive and all

01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:21.820
that stuff but then you hear stories like people's sexual development like like people

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:27.540
summer camp stories and things are just like different like everybody has like a weird

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:33.460
story from their life like there's nobody got through with what anyone would describe

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:37.660
as a normal sexual development like everyone has like one like thing that would make other

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:46.340
people go wait what wow but like and like yeah I said I but but you know what one thing

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:50.580
that I'd never did was like well I mean I told you guys about the humping the pillows with

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:56.700

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:15.020
like married women when he was like in high school and stuff like that and we're sitting

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:19.460

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:52.620
okay so yeah yeah here's my conversation I said why and he said sorry and then I said

01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:56.940
ha ha and then he said did you see that soccer player do a Rick and Morty reference and I

01:23:56.940 --> 01:24:00.740
said I miss you Rob who you're doing well I said huh no I didn't he said it's fucking

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:05.660
insane Harmon has to know about it I can't I can't believe he hasn't said anything and

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:09.460
I said send me the clip all right I don't know if it's whatever fuck it he sent it to

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:26.020
me right yeah okay here it is the Rick and Morty soccer clip yeah okay so Spencer you

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:33.620
want to explain for the people it was a five dollars this one yeah there was a soccer clip

01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:38.740
and it quickly cut to an old man or woman lying you know listeners for five dollars

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:47.300
a month being licked by cows you can see Rob's Rob Rick roll you into watching a man's dick

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:54.500
he's like a cow it was a guy laying down in the field and I mean first it was soccer

01:24:54.500 --> 01:25:01.100
yeah for three three seconds it's a clip of a Schrab.does this thing where he he does these

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:05.500
clips where it's like someone's about to hit a baseball and then like because he I think

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:10.900
he there's me there's what what are the videos like that where it's like your sense of anticipation

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:15.340
as a viewer is heightened because something's about to happen like a baseball's about to

01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:21.300
get hit or something's about to impact and then it'll cut to like a crazy porn clip like

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:27.940
a woman getting hit in the face with a giant dick or something and this one was a soccer

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:33.060
game and the guy's about to kick what will either be a goal or not a goal so now you're

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:39.940
invested you lean in and it cuts to as his foot impacts the ball it cuts to a man laying

01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:46.300
in a field with multiple cows around him one cow is kissing his ear one cow is kissing

01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:56.780
his ear no nipple play but what the main cow I'll call him is is is just look I mean it's

01:25:56.780 --> 01:26:04.340
like he's I mean you'll see why in a second he's suckling on his penis I guess I hope

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:10.540
I hope he's not chewing on it I hope he thinks it's an utter not a not a field it was it's

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:16.060
disturbing because the cow is like going up and down and it's just it was an unfortunate

01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:20.460
clip to receive and I didn't send it to you I didn't send the guys I got he sent it to

01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:25.020
me and think I mean he's crazy oh okay yeah all right you got to be so relaxed to not

01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:28.820
fidget during that he was so still like he was completely he knows that what he's been

01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:33.100
out there hours that you have to stay still to further get the cows to come right it's

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:37.980
like seagull seagull hunting right yeah did I tell you guys about the time that I scared

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:44.500
a bunch of buffaloes no so like I was camping on Catelyn as long as you scared the whole

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:51.940
buffalo then you're I was camping on Catelyn Island and there is just a bunch of Buffalo

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:57.860
had wandered in and so I snuck into the middle of the the pile of Buffalo or whatever not

01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:02.740
a pile it was like a group though and then I played a really loud sound on like an emergency

01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:07.940
radio it like hadn't siren and then all the buffalo like scattered in all directions but

01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:12.180
I didn't realize that they could have scattered in like one direction and like just ran me

01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:17.580
over and I could have just been murdered on an island yeah you just you forced a stampede

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:20.580
that you could have been right in the middle yeah and I definitely would have deserved

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:23.860
it really dumb way to do it yeah they must have thought you looked like an alligator

01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:30.100
right just enough he's like he's I think I'm sure I said we need to like we need to hire

01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:33.940
like a person who's just in charge of telling a week ago like I'm sure I've said this before

01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:39.500
and then the person can go yes he did let's go have a little alcoholic like deputy but

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:44.580
but I was sitting with Dino and they're talking about Buffalo is that you have you had Buffalo

01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:47.940
meat or something like that I'm like Buffalo meat this is a dangerous species he's like

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:52.660
no no they're fine now I guess I was like what how do we wait we saved Buffalo and he's

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:55.900
like yeah yeah they're fine there's like a million of them or whatever I'm like that's

01:27:55.900 --> 01:28:01.980
not a lot it's like don't don't get off on a tangent in the retelling of this and I won't

01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:06.740
I won't um but I was like how did we how did we save Buffalo that fast there's all these

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:12.980
endangered species and he said Dino said well have you ever seen a female Buffalo and he

01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:19.820
and he he whistled he did the I can't whistle he's like did that whistle well his hands

01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:34.060
formed the perfect outline of a Buffalo it's like he went it was like if there was a hieroglyphic

01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:41.540
of a Buffalo he just traced it with his hands while making that whistle it was the funniest

01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:46.140

downstairs and go off in pursuit of the ghost yep all right it's it seems to be going a

01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:42.340
bit north towards the edge of town the location of the graveyard even though I don't need

01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:48.660
it because we're following a ghost I use no direction so I can discern north oh it's that

01:31:48.660 --> 01:32:02.420
way all right I just wanted to use that level zero spell yes good well we're walking notes

01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:07.780
diarrhea how do you think that went down what would we do right would be how can we avoid

01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:13.060
I wasn't you know I got caught up in the moment and I wasn't really paying attention to what

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:19.340
you guys are doing I would be woodpeckers or I'm really ashamed of myself and I let fear

01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:26.620
take over I should just talk to that woman before acting so violently you know it wasn't

01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:34.700
very churchly of me well we're a different kind of church we're part of the church militants

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:44.220
we're out here to kick button you know and diarrhea I think I don't I think that it's

01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:50.140
great this is what this is what it's all about it's about penitents after the fact like it's

01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:55.700
not whether you make mistakes about how you repair so good job like I'll tell you what

01:32:55.700 --> 01:33:03.100
I did wrong everything like I ran my mouth I I thought I ran upstairs when I shouldn't

01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:06.740
know if I like went in there you know it's just like I got a hang back and I got a slow

01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:14.780
my role I haven't been out of the place that I was before the adventure started in a while

01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:19.580
during this I'm taking some cloth and bandaging up my sliced ankles and I also use some cloth

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:27.340
to bandage bandage DJ up to all right then you succeeded that but it's never too late

01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:31.580
to start fresh that's what I wanted to say I say we start like let's say we got off to

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:38.020
a bouncy start but now mistakes were made lessons were learned let's be professional about this

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:42.180
let's look under every bed and every room we go into from now on and let's also you

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:48.180
know let's let's let's when we encounter other people let's not assume that they're monsters

01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:57.540
and that they're hiding something that's I'm talking to myself I think that the silver

01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:03.380
flame is shining on us in a world where a bouncy mission can result in a child being

01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:10.140
freed of an evil spirit that was beautiful there were no deaths on that beautiful did

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:16.380
the ghost just leave or we are we still following him okay we're walking talk yeah that was

01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:27.060
a walk and talk how close are we to the graveyard oh man you're there oh all right the graveyards

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:32.340
on the edge of this little this this forest the forest stands thick isn't and imposing

01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:38.740
it looms over the buildings of the tiny town kind of like like like an ominous horizon

01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:46.260
of clouds there's air coming from the forest it feels a bit more fresh than like the stale

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:51.420
town air but you make your way to the graveyard it's a little rickety graveyard for a small

01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:55.700
little town but there's a lot of graves in it more than you'd expect for a town of this

01:34:55.700 --> 01:35:02.820
size which is about 10 people conservatively it's a little graveyard just full of graves

01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:14.340
you see some graves yeah I examine the dates of the deceased oh there's no dates that says

01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:23.740
if someone didn't read them down I have no idea when these people died maybe they didn't

01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:28.820
want us to know what do you think we could tell just from looking at the freshness of

01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:35.780
the graves like what's the ratio of fresh graves to old graves you see you see there's

01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:43.500
maybe about three graves that seem pretty fresh like like less than a month fresh where

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:49.820
did the ghost go the ghost it went over to the to the thing and it kind of went like

01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:55.860
above the graveyard and it kind of faded out and went so it didn't go to any specific

01:35:55.860 --> 01:36:00.580
grave not at the moment do you think it was mad at us that sound do you think that's the

01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:03.500
sound of it leaving or do you think it was like I think I think you're projecting I

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:09.460
think I think ghosts make weird scary sounds that's that's that's what ghosts do I think

01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:16.100
you know you're being needlessly you know oh at the same time Don is starting to break

01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:21.460
you've been up all night I go over and read the names on the graves of the freshest ones

01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:31.220
all right the freshest ones the freshest ones are are are okay Ving Reims Blazen Bazin and

01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:36.620
Archer fell those are the three graves that seem freshest guys we need to focus on this

01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:45.500
Ving Reims character who who's a second one he died by the way like within a month well

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:54.140
I don't know who's the second name after Ving Reims before Archer Blazen Bazin he was related

01:36:54.140 --> 01:37:08.860
to Jerry Lewis I think I thought like Jeff Leppard write songs about him okay I think

01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:13.100
we might want to examine the grave of Archer and maybe see how he died sure do some forensic

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:17.980
study should I take my shovel out and dig well let's oh yeah you have a shovel sorry

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:22.340
well let's let's before we do that because I mean we're I feel like we're we're in the

01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:28.860
black with the family you know like yeah let's just read the headstone it's a regular headstone

01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:39.060
yeah it says Archer fell that's all it's regular yeah all right dig it up dig it up look I

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:44.300
just want to I want to do right by you guys you know I sometimes I might suggest a stupid

01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:50.740
thing you just got to tell me right I'm gonna dig up this grave though I take out my foldable

01:37:50.740 --> 01:38:02.300
shovel fold it out start digging all right okay yeah wait yeah great you dig a hole in

01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:08.420
the ground you dig and you dig and you find you find the coffin the wooden cheap coffin

01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:15.340
the coffin of a peasant it has it has what do you call it like you see slightly curved

01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:22.500
scuff marks divots on it like like things have been hitting the outside of the coffin

01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:30.940
recently do you see those mark I mean is that normal marks for when you put the describe

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:39.540
the marks again sorry they seem like shovel marks I compare the shovel head of diarrhea

01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:45.540
junior shoveled it matches up perfect no no it's just it's just it's a different shovel

01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:51.060
it's a more a more worksman shovel Steve's shovel is like a little trenching shovel it's

01:38:51.060 --> 01:39:00.060
kind of like a little compact I'm sure yeah but it lets him achieve great speeds yeah I'm

01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:07.460
sure you use it very well yeah the the but that's important to me this is a we're we

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:13.580
just exhumed a we're re-exhuming a grave yeah that's data I it's it's not open though right

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:20.220
the well it's your it's mostly still covered you're just seeing like I'll take some work

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:25.060
if you want to get the coffin out of the ground we all I start helping dig around and get

01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:27.900
the coffin all right well what's your goal do you want to get the coffin out of the ground

01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:33.540
or just into an openable state or what are you trying to do openable state okay all right

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:38.820
you do that you get the live lit off and you notice that most of the nails are gone and

01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:49.900
inside you just see the corpse of a dog it's like a rotting dog what this is fucked up

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:57.340
I call out to the to archer if Archer's spirit is still present are you here you get no

01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:04.100
response all right oh at this point it's like say about eight in the morning it's past dawn

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:11.500
because it takes a while to dig up a great guys it takes a community to what no that's

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:22.340
just because that's over it takes a Rick and a Morty for six seasons we have it it takes

01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:30.060
it I I'm going to cut to the end what I'm going to say it's it's morning I think we

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:37.380
should we should cover this back up as quickly as possible and because we're the rest of

01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:41.940
our mission is going to have to do with finding facts from people that might not be willing

01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:45.820
to talk to us right okay I just examine the dog and rest of the coffin to see if there's

01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:52.780
anything interesting on the like like like a collar identifying it or anything like that

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:56.740
no nothing on the dog or anything nothing nothing else in the coffin besides the corpse

01:40:56.740 --> 01:41:01.500
of the dog no there's nothing like remaining it just seems kind of like it was disturbed

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:06.500
a little bit yeah so they took this body out for some nefarious magic and left a dog in

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:12.380
its place how old I mean how long do you think this dog has been buried here the dog seems

01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:16.580
like it's been rotting for a while like it seems mostly decayed like it was decaying

01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:21.820
before they tossed it in there's another scenario that involves two exhumations the second being

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:27.580
ours is that the dog was put in the coffin for weight it's part of a fake funeral the

01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:38.020
boy was never in it and then girl the girl I don't see gender the the and that either

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:44.620
the family or maybe the other family that was burnt to death or who knows like got suspicious

01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:49.500
dug it up found out the truth paid for it with their life I mean there's that scenario

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:57.380
too should we dig up being rams or should we just I think I think you're right you want

01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:04.820
to go ahead into town this morning yeah well let's let's put the diarrhea rebury this coffin

01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:10.300
okay we probably all chip in you know many hands make a quick one I don't have any moved

01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:20.260
dirt spells that's okay why don't you cast use hands I start burying the dog again I

01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:31.060
help all right all right yeah I cast detect high road I'm I help to it's an opportunity

01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:42.580
to I believe that a strenuous labor is a punishment that will make me a purer you believe that

01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:47.460
all right you do the thing it's buried it's it looks pretty fresh but what are you going

01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:52.580
to do right I think I'm gonna make it look a little fresher maybe put some pitchforks

01:42:52.580 --> 01:43:06.540
on the I just need to die was that the pitchforks a straight reference yeah the idea of freshness

01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:12.860
as urban culture from the 80s right that's that's that's a pretty deep cut yeah all right

01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:16.620
let's head let's head into town and start asking some questions you guys maybe a get

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:22.780
something to eat we haven't eaten I know and we just did a lot of calorie burning reburying

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:27.220
that dead dog why don't we go back get our get our wagon take it into town is that our

01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:31.860
euphemism for eating oh that we have an actual wagon we had our wagon that we just left yeah

01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:37.100
you hit it you hit it somewhere on the fell farm or near the fell farm before you first

01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:40.980
went in back at the farm kind of crazy walk back get in the wagon then ride back to where

01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:44.220
we have they're gonna find our wagon and they're gonna fuck this wagon as we're assholes they're

01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:48.220
gonna fuck up our wagon what time fails to fuck up a wagon what why why take the body

01:43:48.220 --> 01:44:00.740
of a dead child oh Steve we're hungry how far a walk is it into town yeah a couple minutes

01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:04.940
you're pretty close it's a small town can I answer that question given that as a cleric

01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:09.620
I am like with a bulk of my skills are knowledge categories one of which is knowledge of our

01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:15.500
canna you know like do I have an answer to that question what what would you typically

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:22.420
do assuming necromancy possibly with a dead kid like like why would you want a dead kid

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:30.940
okay what are they good for what's your what's your knowledge our canna or knowledge religion

01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:39.580
well it's just checked off I don't it would be your wisdom my well knowledge our canna it would be intelligence

01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:49.460
that's what it says okay what's your intelligence seven necromancy boom so it's so I don't really

01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:53.980
have knowledge of our yeah I just kind of like cliff clavin about it I've got a plus

01:44:53.980 --> 01:45:02.340
four arcana knowledge okay well and I have a I have my intelligence I have a 16 intelligence

01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:10.180
too so please well why don't you ask why don't you take five because I don't know what five

01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:18.340
is I'll just I'll take a bunch what were those numbers again Jeff 16 intelligence in a plus

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:26.820
four knowledge our canna okay all right Dan you realize that necromancy is a branch of magic

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:41.700
involving death Jeff you realize that the flesh of the living especially of innocence can be used

01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:48.740
as a powerful magical reagent the what of the other youthful what just the flesh okay oh only the

01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:55.420
flesh yeah I mean Dan I mean Carlos you did real good there by the way but make up job but

01:45:55.420 --> 01:46:02.740
sometimes they use the flesh of the of children it's a very powerful magical agent so they might

01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:11.860
be using that for some of their spells that's brutal who it's enough to make a kid haunt the

01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:19.460
world wonder what they're trying to reanimate reanimate is no you said you said reagent

01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:35.180
read reagent means like magical catalyst got it or something look I'm I'm only a 12 intelligence so smarter than me alright

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:42.580
let's walk into town boys let's get breakfast what is we is hungry for well certainly not dog

01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:55.860
all right the town is not like it's not like a big town it's like it's literally like six

01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:00.780
or seven buildings you see a building that looks kind of like a half dome like made out of clay

01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:06.460
you see a couple buildings that just look like little small wooden buildings one of them has two

01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:11.500
stories the other end has one story you see like the one-story building has a little garden

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:17.460
outside of it and then there's just two more regular looking homes and then another farmhouse

01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:23.220
other than Tom's and then there's the church so and then there's a big concrete building with a

01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:33.260
giant fiberglass hot dog on top yeah so there's no signage that would indicate like inns taverns

01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:51.220
hotels bistros boutiques je n'ai c'est quoi c'est mad it could wait for a half hour to say that

01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:58.900
there's not a lot of signs but as you enter you kind of walk towards the center of town which is

01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:03.420
like a little hill you see the old one of the only signs you've seen so far which is a sign that

01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:09.460
just says dairy hill and there's like a tree on the top of the hill and you see a woman kind of

01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:16.100
just standing around just looking around and then she sits on the ground except then she sees you

01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:32.260
so she stands back up okay maybe she has some cheese dairy oh it's spelled D e r r y oh all right

01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:36.900
well let's maybe she probably knows good spots for breakfast we should go up there to dairy hill

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:48.180
yeah you who I don't say you who oh yeah Carlos you're kind of the mouthpiece why don't you

01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:57.620
go make her her acquaintance all right young woman hey hey you're you're new here right who are you

01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:07.500
you look churchly hmm I'm Carlos the unimaginative and the inarticulate I I'm from the church in

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:16.340
the silver flame yes I'm new here you have me at an advantage hmm I'm Rhonda you're right right

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:28.500
Rhonda Rhonda of the watch what do you keep watch over the town someone's got to do it what do you

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:40.180
watch for trouble seen any well lately no just recently there's been a lot of livestock's being

01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:45.700
mutilated and murdered like three or four cows by now it's been ramping up it's pretty it's a lot

01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:50.740
you know you lose a cow that's almost you know you're whole lively we passed a couple cows and

01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:57.220
an old guy out in the field recently those those cows seem to be doing all right yeah

01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:05.300
uh any any dogs missing

01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:14.020
uh not that I can think of but I don't really keep track there's just you know wild dogs

01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:18.100
sometimes coming in out of town they're sure they're real trouble so you're not a watchdog

01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:27.940
no I do watch your dogs you do watchdogs I thought you never mind I am I go back to where I was

01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:34.020
standing before I walked up and said that so livestock gone missing huh we'll be mutilated

01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:44.100
we we found it oh can you take me to some of them oh yeah she takes you to tom fells farm oh shit oh

01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:52.260
scene of the crime they're not going to give us any food here I just you know I I thought

01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:57.460
I would have stopped her halfway through this journey but here we are just kind of like

01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:01.540
lost in thought and you don't have to we don't you could stop we don't have to go all the way

01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:07.220
are you taking us to tom fells farm all right yeah I was I say we were doing that right before we

01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:17.460
leave uh so is the bulk of the uh strangeness happening at tom fells farm well I'd say maybe

01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:21.780
half of the cows that are killed were his but that's because we basically have two farmers

01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:32.740
hmm so who's the other farmer uh donovan manneal where does he live over there

01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:40.900
do they have a business rivalry uh yeah I guess I didn't I didn't really thought about it to be

01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:47.620
honest but they must I mean they can't be price fixing that would be a violation of antitrust

01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:57.380
legislation they're supposed to compete with each other unlike airlines who who makes a better

01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:05.540
breakfast burrito because Carlos he loves those breakfast burritos hmm um well we don't really

01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:13.140
do food service here like I got some cheese you want some cheese we'll eat that while you

01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:21.220
take us to Darren McLaren's farm donovan who he means donovan manneal manneal of course

01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:28.420
yeah you wrote down that strap on site too

01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:39.140
all right uh the manneal house is is pretty pretty close it's right there you're right there

01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:46.100
I think we've given we've given the fell family enough business for one 24 hour period let's

01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:52.500
let's go to Donovan's house Donovan answers the door he seems to be in a weird mood he's like

01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:58.740
what do you guys want I'm busy here to help with your cattle problem oh it's not my problem

01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:06.100
that's just the life of a farmer my man word around town is your cattle problems are

01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:15.220
are nothing normal at all well normal normal is what you make of it in a world with ghosts

01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:20.020
and demons and monsters and stuff like cattle mutilations are shitty but it's just part of

01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:25.140
being a farmer I mean I lost a couple cattle here or there but you don't see me making a big stink

01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:31.860
of it not like Tom fell bitching and moaning like his kid getting sick some big deal kids get sick

01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:36.020
my kid got sick it just happened I didn't go bitching around he got better it's fine
