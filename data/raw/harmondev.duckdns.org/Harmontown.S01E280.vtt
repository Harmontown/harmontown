00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Music

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Kiss me, I'm Monday

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
From beautiful uptown Burbank

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Harmontown is now in session

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Please welcome to the stage your Game Master

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Extraordinaire, Spencer Frenchman

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Music

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
What you got in that bag

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Also your Mayor of Harmontown, you know him

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
His name is Dan Harmon

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Music

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Wrapping to the flow

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Wrapping to the beat

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Wrapping all night

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Gonna eat some meat

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Then some veggies

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
What can I say?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
I like a full plate

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
All day

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
My name's Mr. Eating

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm made of a mouth

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
And a stomach

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I like to eat things with the former

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
And swallow them down to the latter

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Fuck your mom so hard

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Then her pussy turned into pancake batter

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Put it in a pan

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Turned it into discs

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Aided down with a swish of red wine

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Cause I'm a functional alcoholic

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
In the morning, I'm calling you

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
For brunch

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
For a lady or two

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Mimosas?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Samosas?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
No

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
That's Indian

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Alright

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Welcome to Harmontown

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Uh

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Is it me, Dan?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Are you getting better at freestyle?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I think you're finding your flow

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
I think I'm getting worse at freestyle

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
I think I'm getting better at

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Focusing in on the 90 words

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
That rhyme with each other

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Maybe Eminem feels the same way

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
No, he doesn't

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Cause he'll say

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Still your mom is Acura

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Wrecked it, gave it back to her

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
You don't know that Acura

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Rimes with back to her

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Unless you're a true rapper

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Like, I'm just thinking

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
I just learned to stay away from the word

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Not in a tempo

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Just rhyme

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Be Eminem for a minute

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
And just try to freestyle rhymes for Acura

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
That are kind of loosely rhyming

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I don't know, it's got bacula

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah, that's great

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Sure, guys

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I mean, obviously

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
So you can do it

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
You have that muscle too

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Now let's hit that beat again

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Put that beat back up

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Now just let it

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
So just be phonetic

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Just think phonetically

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
No, we'll just do better

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Just be real good to true rhymes

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
So you guys, you have my best interest

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Absolutely

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Like, you know, this isn't some kind of side show

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
No, that's not true at all

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm supporting you right now

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
In order for me to be better at what I do

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And to feel better about myself

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
You guys want me to just do another rap

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
No, no, no

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
We're trying to ruin you

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
We're trying to destroy your career tonight

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Through rap

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Spencer and I have been waiting

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Three and a half years for this very moment

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
To take you down

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Tonight is the night

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Let's just, Joe, come on

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Give me a beat

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yo

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yo

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yo

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Whoa

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Yo

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Go

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Yo

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Up and down

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
The snow blow

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Yo

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
The snow blow

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
In the driveway

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Gonna fuck your mama

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Gonna do it the right way

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
See, I can't

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah, you did it

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
The right way in the right way

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
You did?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
That's the same thing

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
It's the same thing I was doing before

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
But you said that after you had Scott Bakula

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Right way, right way

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
We got a big show tonight

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
We got a lot of guests

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
We got a lot of old friends

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
We got better shit to do than to fuck with me

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
No one's fucking with you, Dan

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
We're here to support you

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Maybe I've been drinking

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
The only topic that I have to address tonight

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Is I want to talk about prostate massage

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Thank God

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
So if you think that we can get

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Through everything else we have to do tonight

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
And still address it

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Why don't we get that out of the way

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Let's leave the prostate massage

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
And then we'll bring our guests up

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
We're gonna need a lot of time for this

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Are you saying do we want the guests on stage

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
For this prostate massage conversation?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Well, I guess I'll

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Let's bring up Rob Schrab

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Rob Schrab

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
I'm not saying he's the prostate massage of guests

04:12.000 --> 04:22.000
Or that he's an expert in it

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Hello

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Oh, yeah

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
We got beard growing Schrab

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Always a pleasure

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Is it my Logan phase?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Like it

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Jealous

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Jealous of its lustrousness

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
What phase is Jeff going through?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
You got a haircut

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah, I'm going through my haircut phase

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
You're a guy, Pierce

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
I'm going through my L.A. confidential

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Like 5 and under phase

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Alright, well if you're a fan of mine

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
And you are

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
One of the things that you know about me

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Is that once in the late 90s

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I experimented having heard about

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
The stimulation of the prostate

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
As an extra option

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
At the country buffet of jerking off

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I took a Sharpie pen

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
And put the non-cap end up my rectum

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
While jerking off

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Which I usually do on my knees anyway

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
So I was kneeling on a pen

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
And kind of like moving it around

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And it did feel a little extra good

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And I came the way I usually do

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Through my penis

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
And then I never

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
That was the last time I did it

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Because then I had come

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
And I was kneeling on my bed

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
With a pen up my ass

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And I had to get pulled out

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Was there a mirror in front of you?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
No, that's not something that I think

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Would ever add for me to the sexual experience

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, I don't think you would put it there

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
On purpose

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
There I am

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
There you are, air wolf

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
But so I always thought of it like

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Okay, guys have assholes

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Women have assholes

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
True

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Everyone has an asshole

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
And that guys, because they're homophobic

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Assholes are Mars, vaginas are Venus, I think

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
That guys, because they're homophobic

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
We just associate, we've been socialized

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
To not be like, what are you doing with my butthole?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
And then other people would be like

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
No, there's just as many nerve endings up there

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
As there is in the outside of your dick

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Or the pussy

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Like whatever, it's all science

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
And I've been content to be like

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah, I'm not interested in anal things or anything

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
But the, so here, I just typed it in

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
And I don't know why

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Because I remember a conversation with a friend of mine

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Who, no, well there was, that was the first

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Prostate conversation I ever had was with a Schrab

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Put a pin in that

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
I'll put a sharpie in that

06:41.000 --> 06:50.000
I remember a writer on one of my empire's shows

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Going like, well have you ever had your prostate milked?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And I went, no

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
And he's like, yeah I did that with so and so

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
His girlfriend

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
And so they, you know

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
And then he described this thing

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
And it was like, you said prostate milk

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
So I'm not gonna, I'm just gonna support you

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
And I'll think about it later

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
So then I googled it

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
So your prostate is a, first of all

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Women don't have them, did you know that?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
No

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, I did

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
I just found that out

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Pretty, pretty sure

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I guess I figured that out in my head

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
They don't die of prostate cancer

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
They never do

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Well you know what the prostate does, right?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Well it does, it's the muscle

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
It's the pump on the aquarium

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I mean it puts the pee out

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
It releases for the pee to come out

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
And then it pumps your, a third of your

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
It does the whole pumping motion

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Of everything that makes everything go out

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And it also provides as a gland

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
A third of the total

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Seminal fluid

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Ingredients of seminal fluid

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Hell yeah

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
So apparently the prostate

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
But it builds shit up

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
But I don't know if these are websites

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
That are just selling you

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Spamware

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Anal tools

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And dressing the whole

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Cause they're all kind of geocities looking

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
And there's like a gift of a nurse

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Like going like, yeah this is important for you

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Are these sponsored ads that you're reading?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Like

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
I don't know how I got it

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I think I typed prostate milking into Google

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And then I started surfing

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
As the kids call it

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Image search

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
On the reg

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
And what the people that would

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Keep in mind these are people who are selling you

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Things that you put in your butt

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
So they want you to put something in your butt

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I don't know, they might be on the side of

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
It's in their best interest that you do

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
That you put something in your butt

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Right

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
So they're gonna say

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Run by big butt stuff

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Big butt stuff

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
But apparently I never

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
When I put the Sharpie in my butt

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I wasn't doing it right

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Because you can go to reddits

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Where people are talking about

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
The prostate orgasm

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Like the milky prostate

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Like you put something in your butt

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Right

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
And you wiggle it around the right way

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
You like massage the prostate

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
From the inside of your butt hole

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
And eventually you'll have an almost

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
To a guy

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
What feels like an involuntary

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Shuddering orgasm

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Right

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
That has nothing to do with

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
When you do the other thing

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
It's like a different thing

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Where you're like whoa

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And there's like an earthquake

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And then there's guys on subreddits

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Going like trust me

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Like I get it

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
You don't want to put a thing in your butt

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
But you show

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Guys

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
And I just am 45 years old

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
And I just encountered it

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Should we make podcast history right now?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Well I think we need

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
We'll make podcast history next week

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
When you said earlier

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
That when you put the sharpie

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
In your butt

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Did you

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
And you said you did it wrong

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Well just I

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
What's the right way to stick a sharpie

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
In your butt

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Right that's what I was pushing back against

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
You did it just fine

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Don't worry

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Well no I did everything

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
As long as you didn't hurt yourself

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Everyone that does something

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Does something just fine

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Well you came didn't you

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
The sharpie wasn't designed to milk your prostate

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
When guys are talking about putting stuff

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
In their butts

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
They're not just saying

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh there's a hole there that feels good

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
When you stick stuff in it

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
That there's also a thing

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
There's a G spot in there

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
But let's not rush too quickly past

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
You can like rub

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
It's great to put stuff in your butt

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Sure

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Everyone loves it

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
It's great to put stuff in your ear too

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
You don't need to milk nothing

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
To just shove a bunch of shit up your ass

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
It's great to let your cat outside

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
But you're not supposed to do that

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
It's great to have a milk shake

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
For dinner

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Yeah

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
I mean look

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Where's this Russia

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
You're going through some shit

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
I add ice cream and apple pie

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
For breakfast

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
Oh boy

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
What if that was the end of the podcast

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
We just actually

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
It was the first

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Great if we had credits to roll

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Is the end of the podcast

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Rob are you lying

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Or did you really have that

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
No I ate it

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Why would you make that up

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
And then do that mic drop

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Both

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Like vegan ice cream

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
And vegan cake

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Both got in from Whole Foods

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Where they sell the whole food

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
Like if you wanted to get 2% of milk

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
They would just give you the whole milk

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
If you wanted to get half a sandwich

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
They would say no

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
You have to take the whole sandwich

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
If you wanted to have

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
You know like

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
What if

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
You're like Reese's Pieces

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
No

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
You have to have the whole Reese

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
This is Whole Foods

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
We don't have pieces or halves

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Or 2% of anything here

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
You want grapes

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Sure

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
That's the gimmick of the story

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Is that their only milk is 100% milk

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
It's the Whole Foods

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
So if you

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Let's say I walked into Whole Foods

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
And said I need some half and half

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
No

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
No

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Go across the street

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And have two gallons of it

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
And you can mix them together

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
In one gallon

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Because we're going to give you

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Whole milk

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I have to take one half

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Can I buy the one half of the one part of it

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
And the other half of the other part of it

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I'll have to talk to my manager

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
That is highly unorthodox

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
It's called being a fur trapper

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
That's what the story would become

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
It would become a trading post

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Where a guy draped in fur

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Was like what do you want

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
You wanted a cow udder filled with

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Everything milk has in it

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Before you remove some

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Or would you like a shoe made out of a log

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Because a shoe is what is that

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
That's just a peered down log

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Your plan is bullshit

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Whatever you want

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
You can't have it

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
It's not how it works

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
So you see the prostate is like a plum sized

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Like growth

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Plum?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Well not a growth

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It's like a plum

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
They say it's the size of a plum

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
That if you put something in your butt

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Like a finger

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Like your own finger

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
You can reach up toward your belly button

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
And you can feel something

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
The size of a plum

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I'm sure you can feel all sorts of stuff

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
And they say don't rub the middle of it

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Don't rub the middle of it

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Don't rub the middle of it

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Rub each clove

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Rub each like

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Chemistry

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Like don't rub the middle

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
The middle hurts more than it does anything

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
It's got lobes

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
The idea is that you get your prostate

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
It's more than a muscle

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
It's like a factory

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
It's making a third of your cum

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
It's mostly a factor

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
I'm surprised like the way that you know it is this

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Urine pump is very strange to me

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I don't want to use this card

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
But I grew up in the 80s brother

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
It's always interesting to pump

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
All we had to know

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Spencer when I was your age

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
You know what we had to know

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Who forms the head in Voltron

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
That's what we had to know

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Who forms the head in Voltron

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
The yellow lion probably

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Whatever

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
You know why don't you shoot up a school

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I thought of it

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Alright alright

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Why don't the rest of you put it on the comment card

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Okay alright

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
No that's good

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I was saying that his generation

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
You can't say that that came out of me

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I was accusing him of it

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Who do you think was

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Who do you think was the Christopher Columbus

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Of

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Frostate Massage

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Well remember you told me

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
You gotta try it

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
That when you rub the

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Your taint

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It like

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
What it doesn't what

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Now I just do it

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
25 years of coming

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And now I just my hand goes there

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Because Rob Schrab told me something once

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Please don't be thinking about that

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
While you're doing it

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Oh yeah

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm masturbating

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I don't do it anymore

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I have one story about this

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
But I feel weird telling it

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Because church is sitting right there

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Oh don't say it

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
She's not listening

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Church do you want to step inside

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Church didn't do it

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
This is like from when I was 19

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Oh to be cool there I didn't think the church did it

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Yeah

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
There was a girl

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
When I was like 22

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
She stood up in there with her finger

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
And did something I don't know what she did

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I couldn't describe if there was lobes

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Or clothes or whatever the flimflam

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
But all I know is I came

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
For three days

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Like a laser beam

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Wait for three days

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
It was not like a regular pulsing guy

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Orgasm

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
It was just this

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Like

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
The death star blowing up

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Alderaan

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
The beam of orgasm

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
She went up there

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
And found this magic button

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Of my butthole

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I never knew there were different things

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Look you seem exasperated

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Which is insane

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I was holding my breath for a while

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
And I breathed

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
You want to talk

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
No I didn't

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I had nothing to say

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
What am I doing wrong

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Dan

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
You want me to change the lighting

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
What am I doing wrong

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
How can I make you seem crazy

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
You were acting crazy

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
You were like gaspings

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
No I'm not even

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
He was like

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
This is not how prostate touching should be

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
And I'm about to explain what it should be

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Thank you

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I threw you under the bus and pretended you were a clone

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I picked up that signal from him

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I thought he had something to say about it

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
How much stuff have you ever put in your butt

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
To what effect

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
To what effect

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Well I told you about the time

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
When the doctor put the thing in my butt

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
When I was asleep

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I woke up

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
In the middle of it

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
They were making fun of you

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
No they weren't

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I pretended to be asleep though

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
And they were making fun

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Dan

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
You're misremembering

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I pretended to be asleep

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
So I could

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Find out

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
If they were making fun of me

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
And they never did

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
But then somebody sent

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
All of us like

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Man records on his phone

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
The doctor is making fun of him

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
While he's asleep

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Three Rob Schrab stories

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Back to back

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
This is for the people who haven't just finished

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Listening to 350 episodes

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
In a row

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
But if this is your first time here

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Pretend there's a snow storm

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Why Rob Schrab

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Here's the three best Rob Schrab stories in the world

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
First one is

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Schrab

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
There was a

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Let's start with that one so people don't think I'm insane

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
You're just saying

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Like

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
You're leaving me

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I don't know what we're grabbing

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
You're pointing

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I don't know what that means

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I'm sorry

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
But Schrab

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
There's this song called Space Oddity

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Was that the 80s song coming Major Tom

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Are you receiving?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Major Tom

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Or not Space Oddity

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
It's called Major Tom

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
5, 3, 2, 1

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Yes

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I've told this story before

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
There's a verse in the song

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
When the astronaut

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Is drifting into space

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
And he goes

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And then they go across the stratosphere

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
The signal comes in

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
And this is Major Tom

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Communicating to ground control

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
He goes

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Give my wife my love

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Then nothing more

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
And that's the dramatic point where

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
They lose contact with Major Tom

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
And Schrab

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Thought that there was Major Tom

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Saying don't fuck my wife

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Give my wife my love

19:20.000 --> 19:20.000
Not yours

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Jeremy

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Give my wife my love

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
And leave it at that Kyle

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
No more

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Just give her the message

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And take her home

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Okay, you know

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And then there's a Diet Coke one

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
That I told a thousand times

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Where the guy on the set

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Of Heat Vision of Jack

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
The medical guy is talking to us

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And Schrab goes I'm drinking too much

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I gotta stop drinking so much Diet Coke

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
And the medical guy goes

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah, well you know it makes your dick soft

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
And Schrab goes really?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And the guy's like

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Well, yeah

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
A study show

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah, it does, it makes your dick soft

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Just so you know, and Schrab goes

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Would he just pour it over it?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
And it wasn't

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I'm not telling stories about funny jokes

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
No, no, no

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I'm telling stories about the moment

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
See, this is a different fucking world

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You're putting it up already

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It makes your dick soft

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
And I said, you mean like silk?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah, like velvet, like no, yeah

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
If you just pour it over it, it's just become like

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Velvet, yeah, no, you're right

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I said silk, you're adding velvet

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
And changing the story

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Which is softer you guys think?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Silk or velvet?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
It's fucking silk, man

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Silk

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Why did I launch into the

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
You said you had a third one

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
It was a trilogy that you just like

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Sorry, it's good

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I don't know

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
It doesn't matter

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I'm just

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I just think it's funny that

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
After all this time it turns out

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
If you stick a finger up your ass

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
You have a different kind of

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Orgasm

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
It has nothing to do with your other orgasm

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Are you going to explore this at home?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I don't know about that

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I'll update my podcast audiences

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I always have

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Sounds to me that if

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
It was as good as you're claiming to be

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
You would do it again

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
You don't know

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
No, I'm saying like when I did it with the Sharpie

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I didn't do

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I didn't do the thing that they

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I thought you said you just recently

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
No, I didn't do, I was reading about it

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Go to the pleasure chest in West Hollywood

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
And go into the toy room

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
And talk to the people that work there

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
And say, hey, I've heard about this

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Prostate thing for a gentleman

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
What's the story on that?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
And they will walk you into a little chamber

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Of like, or down an aisle

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And they go, this is the stuff

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
That

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
You or your partner can put up your

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Butthole and it's going to make you come to

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Jeff, I don't want to cut you off there

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
But if we're going to talk to anybody about this

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
We should bring up DeMorge Brown

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
Oh, yeah

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
DeMorge Brown for the Butthole segment

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
It's time to go deep

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
First let's just talk about

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
The world's greatest intros

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Throughout history

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Okay, Jesus

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Entering on a donkey

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Palm Sunday, right?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
That was a good intro

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Elvis parachuting into

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
The Rose Bowl

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
DeMorge Brown

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Being announced on Harmontown

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
In association with

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Anal stimulation

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Darth Vader

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Coming through the door

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
In a new hope

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Demorge, that's all of them

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Any booty fun stories for us?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Only that

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Things that I've heard

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
That's about it

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
What if you heard Demorge?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
That's probably planned

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I'd rather hear what you've heard

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
It's only going to get better

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
If you go like, well

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I heard a rumor

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Good

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I don't know

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I have friends

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
It comes up in conversation

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
They talk about it

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I have no idea what you're talking about

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
But then they spill their guts

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Name one gut spilled

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Yeah

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
It's not supposed to work like that

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I'm just saying

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
You don't have to tell us about

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
The

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Tell us the real thing

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
It's very real

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Tell us the one story

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
That made you go

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
What, man?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
When was the last time somebody told you

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Like a butt story

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
That made you go

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
What the

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
What the

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
What are you talking about, man?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Or just tell any stories that made you have that reaction

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
It doesn't have to be about my stuff

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Any story that made you go

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
What are you talking about?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Alright, I get it

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
You kind of minor a world star sort of thing

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
There was this story

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
The thing in part was because I was 17

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I think when I heard it

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
But there was a friend of ours

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Who's older brother went to college

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
And

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
He came back

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
One Thanksgiving I think

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
And had a story about a formal

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
He's formal dances where

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
The women would

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
The guy would ask a girl or a girl would ask a guy out

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Depending on who was the host of the party

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
And the idea was

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
You would meet and have wine and cheese and crackers

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
And do whatever

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
And then all hop on a chartered coach

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
To go to a resort somewhere for a big party

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
That involved a dinner

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
With several forks and knives

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
This is a story about butt sex

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Oh, it's getting there

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
You're doing a good job perfectly

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
This is a classier lead up to a butt fun story

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
And the toast master comes down

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
You brought me up here

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
You're doing everything right

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Everyone fucked up but me

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
So

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
This is a story

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And he's probably 19

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Talking to 17 year olds

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
And he's only talking to me and my friend

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
He kicked everybody else out of the room

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
And he says I don't know

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
And also made the guy

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
My friend almost signed a blood contract

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Not to tell mom and dad

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
But he said that

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
He went on a date

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Or was asked by this girl

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
To a formal

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
And he goes to the formal

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
To the party

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Talks about a bunch of the idiots there

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Trying to chat him up

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
And see if he has the qualities

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
To work in finance or whatever

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Older guys

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
They all get in a charter

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
They go to the thing

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
The girl's very nice

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
The conversation is awesome

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
That's our

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Very tone deaf

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Fully guy

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
He doesn't have an expansive library

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And he doesn't have very good timing

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Am I still going with it?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
We're two realities

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Deep where people get on a charter

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Or is it that it doesn't

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
The story came from

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Where you had to go on a plane to get to the

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
No, not a charter plane, a charter bus

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
These are college students

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
But the way you met the guy

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
That's telling the story is you were on a plane

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
No, I'm his little brother's friend

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
And he comes back from Thanksgiving

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
To tell us a story

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And he's saying

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
He's kicked everybody out of the room

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Except us at this party

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
And he's saying here's what college is like

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
That was the funny thing about what he was saying

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
He's telling the story and he just said

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
That he went with this girl

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
They had a great time at dinner

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
They both got liquored up

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
They both decided to leave before the charter was going back

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Got a tax or something to take them back

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
And she takes them back to his room

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
And people do, they get down

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
So to speak

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And the guy wakes up the next day

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
At daylight

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Just as a crack of daylight

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And realizes that he's

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Covered in excrement

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
His entire, like everything

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Oh boy

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And he doesn't know what to do

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
So he sort of gently

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Wakes the girl up and she says

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Oh my god, I have something to tell you

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
But we got to deal with this first

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
To them, they're the only ones awake at this point

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
And they go through this sort of like

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Horrific Swiss family Robinson thing

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Of like taking each piece

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
And figuring out a way to get rid of it

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
The mattress had to go out

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Wait a minute, so where did they go?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
They went back to her place

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Obviously, roommate

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Yes

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Well, it's a non-linear story

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
The protagonist also doesn't know what you don't know

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
You're asking questions that he's going to answer

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
But at the time I didn't

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Right

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
It's a non-linear story

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
It's not linear

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
It was non-linear and I was confused

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Oh, I'm sorry

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
You just interrupted

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
A non-linear story

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
He's a fish

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Let him fucking craft his web

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
We know he's a fish

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
The bottom line is this

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
That everything was cool at the end of it

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
But they had to

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
She had to tell him after they got everything settled

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
They had to clean up

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I have so many questions

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
They had to clean up

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Who's poop was it?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Was it his or somebody else's?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It was hers

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
She has to tell him

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
That she discovered

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
In high school that she had a natural reaction

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
To specifically what you were talking about

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Which is that

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
She has this sort of super orgasm

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
But then

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Her body vents itself

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Evacuates itself

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Maybe she should have led with that

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Maybe she should have said

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Hey, just so you know

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Don't freak out

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I didn't ask to come up here, man

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I might shit all over you

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
The bed, the living room

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I might sleep in it too

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I have to get rid of the bed

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
He was saying the girl should have led with that

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
He wasn't saying you should have led with that

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I was trying to

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
He fucked this chick

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
She pooped her

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
She came so hard

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
He fucked the shit out of her

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
They had to

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
They immediately went to sleep

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Good night everyone

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
You gotta be pretty tired

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I'll say

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
We have to be pretty tired

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
To go to sleep

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Both people

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Both people

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Like she didn't go

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Oh god I just shat all over his

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
His dick, his balls, his stomach

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
His neck

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
And his

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Cheats and everything

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
But I'm just

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Just a little sleepy

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I'm just gonna

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Not off right now

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Namaste

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Can we at least

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Drop $50 on an actual

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Soundboard or something

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Like this

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I know

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm a man of the people

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
It's just

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
The sounds are

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
They raise more questions

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Than they answer

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Sounds like your complaints are unpopular

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
It does

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
But please continue

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
It's just like he does this

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Farting one and I'm like

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Crinkling a

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Gatorade bottle

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Like it doesn't sound like fart

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
And it's like

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
See what's this

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
It's just a mud slide

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
This is a train in a windstorm

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
His soundboard is 9

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Muffled crowds and 3 shitty farts

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
It's just

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
It's confusing you want sound effects

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
To answer questions

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
And then every 20 presses

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
He has to watch an ad for a

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Match 3 game

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Some of those are good

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Yeah

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Well anyways

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Men only have prostates

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Women don't

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And men have

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
They have a grape in their butt

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
That if you rub it the right way

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
There's a whole thing

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
And that's it

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I'm content leaving this topic

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Wait a minute

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
What's that procedure that you

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
When you

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Were the Kalaniks

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Sunday's used to be

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Kalanik day for me

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
And I would get Kalaniks

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Take it from there

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
And it was

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
At first

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I was trepidatious of it

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I was

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Kind of

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I was worried about it

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Because I heard stories

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
About what they do there

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
But when I got there

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
And then they took care of me

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
It was actually

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
In hindsight it was pretty good

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
It was alright

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
In hindsight

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
You felt cleaned out

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Yes, I felt great

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
People said

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
My eyes were brighter

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
My

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
The people at the facility

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
No, no, no

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
People at work were going

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
You look good, what are you doing

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
All number two

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Except one time

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
She said

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Whatever you do

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Maybe two days before

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
You come in here

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Eat something

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Eat something hot

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Whatever

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
And for some reason

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I forgot I had an appointment

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
And I spent

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
All day eating french fries

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Chips

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
She said

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Eat stuff, but don't

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Work hard

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Don't point

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
A snowblower at the

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Shovel

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
At the sidewalk

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Halfway through

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
There's a problem

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I'm getting some blockage

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Which is

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Which is hot

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
It's a turd

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
And anyway

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I'm going

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
And she's being very cool

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
She's trying to make conversation

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
She's like, just breathe

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
You're gonna be okay

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
So what are you and your wife gonna do this weekend

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
How's your dog doing

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
She's okay

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
And I'm tapping my leg

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I don't know

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Man

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
She's like, just breathe

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Okay, you're leaking a little

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
She's telling you that

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Do you need to

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Do you need to go

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Do you need to go

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
And I was like, see if you can breathe through it

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Do you don't have that

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I'm like, I can't

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Okay, okay, okay

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I'm gonna pull it out

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Can I pause?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Sure

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
A lot of people listening

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Want to know

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
What position you're in

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I'm laying on my back

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Laying on your back

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Laying on my back

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
And there's a tube coming down

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
I start on my side

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
She puts a tube up my butt

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
And there's a tube coming down from an IV line

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
But what do you call it

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
And there's a machine with a little window

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
You can see all the stiff you ate

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Throughout the week going by

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
But when it comes out of different hose

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
I mean

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
What do you mean comes out of different hose

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
You just said you saw stuff going by

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
And also she's concerned about leaking

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Like isn't the whole point to leak

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Well, it's supposed to

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Like shoot water up your butt

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
And then

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
For a while

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
And then it breaks down everything

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
And I guess she turns it up

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And it sucks it out

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
I didn't know that

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
So

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
To eat a bunch of french fries

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Is to create a kind of dam

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Of half french fry

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Half

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
It's painful

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
It's palpable that this isn't going all the way up

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
The water is supposed to go all the way up

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
There's supposed to be a gopher in this hole

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Yeah

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
We've come to an impasse

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
And she's saying

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
To you and she says

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Are you going to be okay?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Do you want me to stop

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
She means do you want to go take a shit

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Or she's saying should I run for cover

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Should I

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Get behind her

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
The story's not over yet

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
So anyway

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
And I'm like

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I can't do it

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I can't hold it in

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I'm saying to her there's only one person in the room

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
No but I thought inner monologue

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Inner monologue

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Inner

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Inner monologue I thought you said in her monologue

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
No

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Like she did stand up while I was

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
During her monologue you're talking

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
No I'm sorry

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
You're saying out loud you're going

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I'm having a

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I can't

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
I think I need to go

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
She's like okay well

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
You're really leaking

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Okay here we go

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Walk from the table

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
To the toilet that's across the room

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And just

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Shit all over her

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Shit on her, the floor

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Everywhere

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
And then while I'm

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Shitting and she's just

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I'm alone I said yeah I think

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I need some time alone

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I don't understand

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Why she's not more

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Why her industry isn't more

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Prepared for this

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
She told me not to eat french fries

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
That's too much

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
She did her job I screwed up

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
And she

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Had a wonderful attitude about it

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Because I was like

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
You're leaking it

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Sounds like you have a dysfunction

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Not oh you've been using

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Your body the way a body should be used

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
You're leaking there's a turd halfway down

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
The water is hitting the turd

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Early she could just

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Couldn't she just tie it off

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
There's all this water that's already

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Up in my intestine right now

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I mean she could turn it off but there's still stuff up there

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
When she checked in with you and said

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Hey something's happening

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Can we get on the same page here

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
And like if you had said

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
No it's cool

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
She would have been like

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Okay I'll just increase the pressure of the hose

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Yeah I mean like what would happen

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
On your average day

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
There would be moments of oh boy

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
That's a part

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
That's a part there

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
That's an area that's something

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
We have to deal with and then I'd be like

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
And then she would get out

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Jazz man

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
There's a clump of grass in there

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Okay this is going to be

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
And then we would go through

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
And it would

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
This is the thing is like they're getting out

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
All the gunk and crap and shit

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
And awful stuff and cleaning you up

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
That's what I'm confused by is how they regard that

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
As force majeure when it happens

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
This is a turd in this ass

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
That's like the united going

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Ladies and gentlemen again we do have a full flight

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I don't know how it happened

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I know how it happened you double booked

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
You work in the airline or

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Ass industry

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I'm on your side

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
My ass is supposed to suck that out

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Cleanly and efficiently

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
What's supposed to suck?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
The tube that's in my bag

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Is it sucking or is it shooting?

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
It's doing both it's shooting water up

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
And then sucking it out

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
She turns up water for a while and then she goes

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Okay I'm going to do some suction

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
And you go oh what is that

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Onions

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And then

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
But then there's some times where

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
It's too much

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Where I'm like a good good good good

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Where it's like oh man

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
You know when you're trying to hold in like

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Poop and stuff

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Okay so when she says it's leaking

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
She means

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
You're shitting all over my hands

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
She means my arm

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
My blouse

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
She means you are not being a conduit

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
You're a broken circuit

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
She's

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Regretting some life choices

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
She's saying like there's

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
A lot because

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I hate to acroid you

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
About this but the so the thing going up

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Your ass is a two

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
It's got two tubes

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
An ingoing in it

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I think it's a two way thing

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Like an electrical cable

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
It's completing a circuit

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Like the whole

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I think I got

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
I feel right about this

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I'm not exactly sure

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I'm sure there's plenty of people

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
That are listening to this show

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
That will kindly correct me

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I don't think anybody's

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Still listening to this show

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
No no no

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
So

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
We're talking to the void right now

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Except for the best people in America

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
She pulls it out

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
She pulls it out and it's just like

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
You know

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Popping a water balloon and I'm just like

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Yeah

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
And I'm doing this

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Oh

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Shit all over my hand

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
The floor

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
It looks like

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
I'm going to give you some time alone

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Yeah I think you should

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
She leaves the time alone

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
And then she turns on

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
The ambient music

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
A little louder

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
She can just switch on the door

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Oh what a feeling

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
So they will dance it on the sea

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Yeah the music goes up full

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And of course

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I'm finishing on the toilet

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And after I've washed my hands

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
The first thing I do is

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Of course I have to text AG

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
And go I just shit all over

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
This poor woman

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
And he's writing back oh my god

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
What are you talking about

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I got this

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
This colonic

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
And I ate poorly

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Two days before

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
And it gave me some issues

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Shit all over this woman

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
I mean that's the part I'm trying to

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
It's not that I don't have anything not figured out yet

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I'm just sort of trying to wrap my brain around

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
The colonic industry

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Come inside we're going to wash the inside

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Of your butt out

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
We're going to pump warm water

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Up one side we're going to suck

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Everything that comes out the other side

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
No it's the same tube

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
She's water up

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
It's the same tube

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
They're moving forward

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
She's got a

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
She's in charge

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
This is starting to make sense

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
She's like Mark Twain

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
She's got a mechanism

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
She's like forward and after

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
There's soapy water going that way

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And then she's like okay how you feeling

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
And you're like peachy and she goes cool

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And then she's supposed to see

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
A certain amount of

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Coming back and then what she sees

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Is you know a half a pineapple

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
And she's like did you

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Have a heavy breakfast

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
And you're like no you told me not to

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
And she's like suit yourself

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
This thing's a lie detector

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
She shoots it up forward

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
And then you're like okay that's not fun

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
And she brings it backward and there's like a wedding ring

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
And a wrist watch

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
And she's like look you had brunch

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Say you had brunch

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
I had brunch and she's like go to the bathroom

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Shit out your

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Shit stuff

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Before I clean your asshole rim

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Okay and she threads it out

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
And then diarrhea explodes everywhere

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
All over the world

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
And she's like

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
And she goes

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
And she's like it's okay

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
And she kills herself

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I never see her again

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
But she didn't say

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
She wasn't like it's okay it's okay it's normal

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
She wanted to impress upon you

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
She's been doing this for a long time

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I'm sure I'm not the first time

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I'm sure today was not the first time

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
If you ate a

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
As in the Stephen Wright bit

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
If you ate a box of Oreos

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Before going to the dentist

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
They'd be like look

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
What did you do? Come on

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
You want to meet me halfway

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
And you'd be like what do you mean

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
You ate a box of Oreos

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I want to give my money's worth

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
You're the expert

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Yeah they changed the tube

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Everybody gets the same tube

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Leavey

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Leavey asked from the audience

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Do they change the tube?

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Do they change the tube?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Yeah even I'm

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
For those of you listening

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
That's diarrhea sound number

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Right

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I mentioned this on the

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Another

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Another episode

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
But she made it a point to say

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
There's the nozzle tip

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
There's like an adult size

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
And then there's a child size

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
I like to use the adult

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
A child size

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
On adults because it's not

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
As evasive

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
So it's the size of a small

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Dick

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Why do we think that

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Men in America

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Associate

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
The butthole and things going

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Up it like why is that

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
A normal amount of American

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
But like

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Women too

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Is it an American

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Butthole thing or is it a male

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
American

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Gay thing

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I think it's an American male

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Gay thing. I think the worst thing

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
You could ever be in America

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
For most Americans believe this

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Is to be a gay man

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
And we're told early on that

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Gay men use the butthole

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
That's the joke

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
That you're told in

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
They don't have vaginas to

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Use the butthole

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
That's the beginning of being

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Othered as a kid

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
You're gay man

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
And everybody goes

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
We're also genuinely ashamed of jerking off

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Kids that you talk to

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
There's different mythologies

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Are kids still ashamed of jerking off?

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I had to move towns

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I had to change schools

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
The family left town

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Because somebody

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Caught him

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
And looked through the window of his house

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
And he was there masturbating

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
And his nickname became Jack Hammer

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Yeah, I remember you telling me about that

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
And he was so ashamed and humiliated

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
He left the goddamn town

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
And that's for you kids listening

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
And my kids I mean 30 and below

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Here's how you fort that

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
If you're a high school

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Masterbader

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
In high school you're masturbating

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Don't let people catch you

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Be in the bay window of your house

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
And you should be jerking off

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
And dare them to come up in your lawn

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
It's a different steeple chase

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
But the crazy thing is

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
That kid, because there was no internet yet

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
That kid could look in your drapes

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
See you jerking off

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
And then convincingly tell the locker room

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
He was jerking off and then you'd have to change schools

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
This isn't about changing times

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
This is about our attitude

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
About sex

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
And self exploration

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Because like how bad it's always been

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
And hasn't really changed

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Even though nowadays a kid could look in your drapes

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
And see you jerking off

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
But the difference is

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
If he didn't have his camera

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
It'd be your word against his

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
And it wouldn't matter

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
It's really about the cringe value

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Of how you look when you jerk off now

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Because now the kids know everyone jerks off

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
But how vulnerable you are

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Which is the same thing

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
You know what I mean?

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
The things that you're talking about now

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
We're around at a time where now

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
There are kids in that age group

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Who now are adults

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
And have children

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
And they probably socialize them differently

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
And sometimes they bet you're fucking the kid up

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
By trying to be responsible

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Like who wants your dad sitting on the foot of your bed

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Talking about your dick

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
It could be the 40% of the time

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
When you think you're doing it right

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Who's dad it is?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Chris Pratt's dad

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I'm just saying

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
You don't know you could have the best of intentions

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
You could have

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Because we don't have

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
We know everything about beastings

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
That you should know by now

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Until we invent a way to treat beastings better

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
We don't know anything about

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Kids going through puberty

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
And like starting to feel

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
How they feel and blah blah blah

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
We put it off

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
And it's not even just

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Even though we feel like in America

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
It's the species

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
It's the whole fucking species

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
We don't just go

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
By the way, there's a thing in your butt

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
And there's a thing in your balls

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
No one wants to talk to kids about this shit

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
When do you talk to them?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
You're seven years old

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Before you care about it

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Let's talk about your butt and your balls

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
And your dick and your nipples

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
What are you talking about? Spiderman

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
But then a year later that kid could be like

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I'm gonna go fucking insane

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Because no one understands what I'm going through

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Because my nipples feel weird

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Fucking, what a lost species

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Do women shame each other about masturbation?

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Is that a girl thing?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Church?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
I've never heard a story of

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Women walking in on another girl

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Masturbating in high school and that being a giant bummer

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Is that just a guy thing?

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
You did it together

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Yeah, they learned, I mean I hear a lot of

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Stories about girls like more

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Like this kissing and stuff

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
But I'm not gonna

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Spokesman that, but I do feel like

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
But I've also heard stories about

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Dudes talking about jerking off

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
And then one kid in the group of friends

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Will be like, yeah, jerk off, it's the best

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
And then that'll just be the story of how

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
That kid changed

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
That community

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
They're like, oh, but you're cool

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
And he's like, yeah, and I fucking jerk it off all the time

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
So do all of you, bye

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
And everyone's like, he's right

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
I've heard those stories, it's kind of like

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
If word got out in

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
My high school that

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Anybody, any of the

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Guys that got outed for

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Wearing women's underwear, that guy would

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Have been run out of town

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
But there was one guy who was a badass

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
And his dad was like in the mafia

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
And there's people like, hey man

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Apparently you wear like women's panties

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Like silky little like

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Thong panties, he goes, yeah, they're really comfortable

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
And everyone's like, oh shit

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Like

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
If he backed off on that

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
That he would have been tortured

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
But he goes, yeah, why don't you

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Yeah, I've heard a couple of those stories

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
They're called taste makers

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
They're called the

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
And I don't know if

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
It's like we want to talk about

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
How girls are different from boys

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
But also it's like

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
If you were high in high school, did it

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Me and these ads, we would have been really punished

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
For it, but you and I as adults

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
We like

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
To wear the soft undies

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Yeah, we like soft undies

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I'm hungry, I'm starving

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I missed dinner, yeah

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Do you wish the podcast was over so you could go eat?

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
No, I wish I brought something to eat

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
What would you have brought if you had planned ahead?

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Chiyo

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Psst

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
We all know the answer to that question

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Now as a vegan now

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
How do you get your nachos?

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
You do the vegan nachos?

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
But I don't do

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
I do vegan cheese

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
It's not the same

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Vegan cheese is kind of a drag

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
It's getting better

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Everything's getting better

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Beyond burgers

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Are fantastic

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I don't melt

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Vegan cheese

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
It just doesn't taste as good

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
But

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I still love it

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Eat that shit

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
I went and had a chat with Kevin Smith

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Who is basically vegan now

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Because he just had his first heart attack

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
I don't want to

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
I'm not scheduling more heart attacks

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Didn't he almost like

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Yeah, he almost died

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
He had a huge total

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
We didn't talk about that that much

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Because I figured he's been talking about that forever on his podcast

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
But

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
He's two years older than me

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
And he

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
So he was never a heavy drinker

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
But now

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
He's like

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
He's just gonna go vegan

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
And it has nothing to do with him caring about animals

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
He's just like

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
They told me I have to

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
It's like all this meat and stuff

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
And then he's like

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Yeah, then my friends are like

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Now that you had a heart attack

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
You're gonna be this kind of person

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
And he's like, no, I'm just

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I ate meat for 47 years

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
It was a good run

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Now I'm gonna go vegan

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Because of this thing happening

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Oh, so you almost died

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Because you weren't doing something

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
So all of a sudden you're gonna start doing it now

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
You were thrown 80 feet from a car wreck

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
And you're gonna start wearing your seat belt

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
All of a sudden

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
It's like a really weird

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
People love to put people down

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
I'm sure there's not a single person we could pull up

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
That they're like, yeah, that was me

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I was Kevin Smith's friend

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I'm sure he was just kind of collectively

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
That would be true

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Kevin Smith still has all these friends that just bully him

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
That would be like

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Amazing

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I wonder what that's like

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
That guy's a big Rob Schwab fan

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
I'll tell you that

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Talk to Kevin Smith about Rob Schwab

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
He's been very nice

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Nice to me

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Did you talk about Robot Bastard?

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
No

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
I was like, can we move on?

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
And he was like

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
What's it like working with Schwab?

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
I'm like, I don't know

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Like, I don't know

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Dumb?

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
No, come on, it can't be that dumb

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I'm like, prove it

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
And he's like, prove what?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
I'm like, fuck you

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
What do you want to do with Kevin Smith?

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
It sounds like you could collaborate

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Hang out with him instead of Dan

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
No

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
That's on the table

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
That's so weak

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Every time I see Kevin

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
He's very, very nice

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
He's actually a big reason why

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I did the last

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Fourishes of Skud

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Somebody sent me, oh, Kevin's talking to you on

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
On the forum

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Remember forums?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
He's talking to you about you on the forum

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
And he just wrote like

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
You know, I love Skud

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
And Schwab never wants to finish the

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Book, it's okay

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I just, you know

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I just respect him, I think he's good

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
And whatever

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I got the whole shebang right here

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Did you buy that somewhere? Is this a new release, Schwab?

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
It's a

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
New edition of the whole shebang

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Which came out in 2008

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
This is the fourth reprint of it

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
And it's got a new cover

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
It's got the whole, it's hefty

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Like the OED or the like

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Yeah, it's like over 800 pages

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
I'm hoping I can do a Kickstarter

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
This year for the 25th anniversary

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
To maybe do, I don't know

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
I'm going to regret saying this

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
But a color version of the whole book

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
I think Skuds, I'm not talking

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Shit about comic books, I just never got into them

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
But I think Skuds are the only

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Comic books I've read like cover to cover

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Oh, thank you

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Because I know you gave them to me

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
But they're so well drawn

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Well, thanks

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
How do you do it?

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I don't anymore, I don't do anything

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
One issue a month

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Like, we would all hang out

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
And we'd smoke weed

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
And drink and do whatever we were doing

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
But then every once in a while

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Schwab would be like

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
How am I going to go work?

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Like, what are you working on?

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I'm working on a thing

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Like he didn't want to open it up to us

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
And talk it out and invite

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Like all of that

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Maelstrom, so he was like

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
For at least a month

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Probably several months

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Maybe like a month and a half

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
But like going home and like Bob Cratchit

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Like fingerless gloves under your kitchen table

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
You're like drawing a page of a comic book

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
And you weren't, it wasn't like running around

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Telling everybody, I'm going to do a comic book

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
And it's going to be about this and that

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Never said anything about it

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Just would go home

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Every night and work on it

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
And then one day

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Unveiled that he, well the rest of us

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Had been not

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Understanding our prostates

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
That he had made this

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Comic book on his kitchen table

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Very interesting

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Interesting behavior

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Delayed gratification, they call it

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I guess

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Yeah, I got it

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Yeah

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
So what would it be like

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
If Kevin Smith had friends

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
That were like making fun of him all the time

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I don't know

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I thought you were asking

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Was I?

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Let's check into a Spencer

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Thank you

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
What do you think it would be like?

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I think it would be a little something like this

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Hey, stop leaving me alone

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I already gave you a copy of Tusk

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Like that

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
How's living with

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Kali Kazoo going?

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
She's pretty cool

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
She's playing Stardew Valley right now

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
We're both playing Stardew Valley

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Stardew Valley

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Is what?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
It's a video game

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
A video game

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
What platform are you playing on?

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
On the Switch, it's great

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Are you both playing on the Switch?

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Yeah, she has one too, we both have them

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
And Switch is jargon

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
You mean a Nintendo

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
It's a kind of game boy

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Nintendo operating

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Man, you're playing on the Switch

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
You're playing them

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
You're playing them games on the Switch

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Can you play that game multiplayer?

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Can she go to your farm?

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Can you go to her farm and switch on the game?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Can you play on the game with the farm?

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
I don't think so

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Can you go Switch?

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
No

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
You guys are living in the same room

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Do you have to be in the same room to Switch?

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Look how mad Dan is right now

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Switch, man

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
I'm gonna get me some nuke

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
I'm gonna go to my dealer and get me some nuke

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Gonna shoot that thing right into my ear

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
You liked video games at one point?

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Yeah, I still do

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
What do you like?

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I like Pepper 2

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
I like Pepper 2

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
It's a good game

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I also like Squisham Sam

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
You're making shit up

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
You're making fun of video games

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Squisham Sam

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
I like Minor 2049er

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
That's an old game

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
from the Commodore 64

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
So you didn't specify that

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
You didn't...

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Do you like video games?

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Here's three

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Those are the video games that I wanted you to play

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Alright Rob

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Desert Island, you get to pick between

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
I would play the Desert Island game

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
You know

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
You didn't hear me out

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
You get one old school

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
one old school 80s video game

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
You have to choose between one of these two

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Desert Island for the rest of your life

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
or until you get rescued

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Burger Time or Elevator Action

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
That's easy

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Come on, man

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Elevator Action

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Oh my god

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Elevator Action

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Harmon?

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I don't know what you guys are talking about

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
I've gotta be honest

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
You never played Burger Time?

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
That's a shit game

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Spencer, did you play Burger Time?

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
It was in one of your raps

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I was making fun of it

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Kevin Smith was a fan

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
of the Mama Rap

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
We sent him the album

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
That's a pretty cold rhyme

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
but your mama plays Burger Time

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
eating up the pickles with a little squeeze of lime

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I'm a craftsman, I don't

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I don't think pickles would need lime

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Your mama gets none

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
She's kind of like a steak

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
cause she's always getting done rare

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Over there, she put Elevator Action

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
and they made her take the stairs

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Is this anything you really denigrate your mom?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I can name maybe three

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Supreme Court justices

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I know all the words to the Mama Rap

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
The Mama Rap

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
is that trackable

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
or can you find that?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Oh yeah, I'm sure it's on YouTube

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I hope it's everywhere

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Did we talk

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
last week

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
did we talk about Nunberg

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
and this isn't a political thing

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
This is entertainment

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Did we talk about Nunberg?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
That video that you posted

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Yeah, just anybody that's listening

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Wait, was I here last week?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Just Google Nunberg

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Sam Nunberg, he's

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
the best

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
He really is like the

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
We thought we peaked at

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
at the mooch

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
but this guy fucking out mooch

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
the mooch by just being

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
a complete fucking

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
It was kind of fun, like it was the very definition

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
of a rodeo clown

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
You smell like booze

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
He just came drunk

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
to tell Robert Mueller to go fuck himself

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
on every

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
liberal news platform

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
It's such a great, like Martin Shorty

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
used to do that Nathan Thurm guy

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
whatever you asked him, he was just like

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
No, I didn't

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I had this affidavit

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
That's stupid

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Don't you think it's stupid?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I think it's stupid

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Oh my god

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Yeah, but that was, I mean it's a different character

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
because the thing about

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Nunberg is, he's like the

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
he's like the

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Cupid version of that

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
like what do you call it, a cherub

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
version of Martin Shorty's

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Nathan Thurm

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
So the sweat hasn't

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
gathered in his lip yet, he's just like

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
a flying baby who just

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
flitted through and he just had a little

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
quiver and it's just like

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I think you should be in love

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Roger Stone's my father, he's like a father figure to me

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
and he just like, he didn't know

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
of anything that didn't taste like marshmallows

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
until that day

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
What was the end result with him?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
He testified

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
He went in and he was

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
He said, I'm not gonna go in and somebody said

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
you're gonna go to jail

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Yeah, it's just rule of law

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
and so he went in and

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
and then he came out and he was like, you know what

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
it's not that bad

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I think that's how it ended

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I think he's like, yeah, it's alright

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
that's fine

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
He just needed a little extra

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
You know, a little baby

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
He goes in for a haircut, you need to like give him a dinosaur to chew on

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
You know, he just needed a little extra from us

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I think he got drunk

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
and then he was like

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I'm gonna be famous

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I'm gonna be like that girl

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
who caught cash meat outside

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
This is gonna be great

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Or like the lady who wouldn't make the cake for the gays

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
or whatever, but like

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I think he brought into the

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
like, I think he got

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
swallowed up in the

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
weird gel that they used

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
to douse the hillbillies

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
like he started getting high on that supply

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
and being like, well, wait, this

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
this subpoena is bullshit

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Hillary didn't do a subpoena

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
and meanwhile everybody's going like, yeah, well we all

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
like, yeah, it's one thing

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
you can't do what you're doing

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
and then you're like watching him go

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
oh, I guess I have to go do it

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I have to go to eat broccoli

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
He got high on the gel

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Thanks, Spencer

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
He looked like

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
You're gonna get high on the gel when you're sweet

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Callie

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I'm in my room with my cat

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I'm gonna go switch on that gel

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
How about you?

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Why don't you

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Why don't you come back?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Why don't you text me back?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Give me some emojis, motherfucker

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I want to get

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I want to switch out, motherfucker

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Come on, motherfucker, let's get high on that gel, motherfucker

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
We got to pay rent

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
What are we gonna fucking do, man?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
We got no money

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
We got to sell some of them

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
We got to sell some of this furniture

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
We got to sell

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
We got to sell some of this

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Motherfucker, we got to

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Motherfucker, we got to sell some of this

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Seafoam couch

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Okay, now he's incorporating her

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Seafoam couch

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Can we get

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Can we sell some of these

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Cushions at least, not the whole couch

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
But just a couple of cushions

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
There's four more

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Cushions

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
That's what happens

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
That happened yesterday

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I never watched an episode of Mary Hartman

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Mary Hartman

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Am I missing out?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Am I missing out? I mean, like, I keep

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
It keeps coming back

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Is anybody, I mean, seriously

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Be serious

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Has anyone on the stage

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Watched an episode of Mary Hartman

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Mary Hartman

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I saw all of them when I was a kid

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Okay, stand corrected

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Tell me the premise of the story

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
She gets bit by a radio act of what?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I was a kid

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
She just seemed

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Out of touch

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
And very

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
It's sort of unhappy, but trying to put a happy face

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
On stuff

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
And they shot it like a soap opera

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
It was on every day

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It was offered to the same buffet as the soap opera

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So you were getting guiding light

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I remember being a late night thing

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
In New York it was maybe syndication

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
It was probably

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
No, 12, they couldn't put it on before

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
It had to go on at midnight

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It was probably the Muppet Show where they sold it syndicated

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Right, but I was always told

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
It was like, oh, that's going to risqué

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
It's going to risqué or whatever

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
What's the deal? She's just like

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
It's because people that

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Consider themselves above a soap opera

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Wrote a soap opera

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
So it was meta

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It was like, I'm a soap opera

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Meet Mupp

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
You're a piece of shit for watching me

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Wasn't Fernwood tonight

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Just been off of that

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And in the show

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
She doesn't hear well

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
You're saying that's why it's called

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Because you have to say everything twice

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Yeah

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Well, let's go to the weather

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Section of our podcast

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
It's been raining

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Tonight

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Weather

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It's partly cloudy

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Always

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Absolutely no circumstances

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
It's a lot of rain, man

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Lot of rain

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Man

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Listen, you hippies

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
You scumbags

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You zipperheads

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
You squeeze squads, you chuds

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It's going to be a rain

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
That's going to wash it all away

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
And I'm going to be that rain

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
You zipperheads

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You tranks

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Are you doing the dude from Warriors?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
With a scholarship

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Back to the future, too

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I'm doing a little taxi driver

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Back to the future

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Who's the dude?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Can you dig it, suckers?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Silas

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Silas from Warriors

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I knew that you could

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Yeah

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Can you dig it?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
All right

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
We remember Patton Oswell

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Tweeted to Obama

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Saying, come on, please, just once

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Say it

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Can you dig it?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Just say once, just once

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
You know we said it in private

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I should go out and blow these people's minds

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I'd like them to go, come on, man

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
That was the best

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Can you dig it?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I wanted to

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I don't have any Zardos quotes

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I'm trying to think

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
The penis is mightier than

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
The gun

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
The sword

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Spencer, did you have a...

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
The gun is good, the penis is evil

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Spencer, did you have a butt stuff story?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Oh, yeah

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
It felt like no pun intended you were sitting on one

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I had a funnel

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
and some golf balls

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
That's most of the story

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
No

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Um

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
No, I don't have a singular

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
butt stuff story

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
What about like an average one?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Average butt stuff story

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Taking a shower

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Put some stuff in your butt

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Some fingers

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
You know

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Seriously at all

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
This is serious

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
No, it was worth a shot

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
We've told the story on the show before

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
about you flying too close

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
to the sun with your bathtub, right?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Yeah, I put my butt up against the nozzle

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
of my bathtub

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
You have like a jacuzzi, like a spa

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Like a water jet

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
What's the melted wax wings

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
of flying too close to the sun?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
You get air bubbles in your bloodstream

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
You get flooded

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
with water

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Oh, like scrub

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Yeah, I just immediately

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
had this sensation

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It was a reverse pooping

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Were your eyes brighter after?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
You texted me immediately

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
and said

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Jeff, I took a bubble bath

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
You have been reporting to me daily

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
about how you found out that you could

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
jerk off in your bathtub

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
by kneeling down in front of the side

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
nozzle and putting

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
jacuzzi water up your butt while you jerked off

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
You're like, it's the best

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And then you texted me one day and said, Jeff

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I flew too close to the sun

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
and I inflated myself like a water balloon

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Yeah

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Yeah, and I had to get out of the now empty bathtub

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
and run

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
over to the toilet and sat down on it and then

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
just like this sound

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
It sounded like you just bought a bucket

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
from Home Depot and just poured it

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
It just sounded like that

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
But I was like, wow, I was like, I gave myself

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Yeah, I've told that story

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Yes, I have told that story

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I'm famously forthcoming

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
And

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Backcoming

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Good one, sir

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Jeff, you told me a story once

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Is this true?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
You didn't know what I mean

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Jeff told me a story

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
once long ago that he says one time

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I shit so bad

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
that I passed out

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
and I

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
hit my head on the sink

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
and then cut my head open

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Is this true?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
It looked like somebody murdered

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
It was the day after Christmas

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
So Boxing Day

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Red Nose Day

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And I was at my grandma's house

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
and I had eaten a lot of Christmas

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
turkey before I was a vegetarian

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
so I'm a pre-toe turkey dish

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I was probably 22-ish

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
22 shits

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I remember waking up

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
like

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
panting

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
and I was like, it was cold where I was laying

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
and I opened my eyes

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
and all I see is floor

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
wall and door

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
and I look up and there's blood

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
everywhere

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
like all over the mirror, the sink, the thing

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
and I apparently had either

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
peed or pooed

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and I was sitting down and got up

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
painted and smashed my face

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
into the edge of the sink

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
and then flew to the other side of the bathroom

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
and landed there and only woke up

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
and my grandma said, Jeff, the phone is for you

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
and I look up and I still have a scar

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
across my nose and it's one

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
of the two reasons my nose goes a little bit that way

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
but yeah, I fucked myself up

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
How do you know it wasn't

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
aliens?

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Is the second reason your nose always

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
goes that way?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I fucking punched you

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
The guy punched me at a Knit Cave

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Oh, that's the, wow

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
That's the reason why it goes a little bit more of the same way

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Oh yeah, that was recent

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
But I

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
This is controversial, remember I talked about

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
the woman Alice Flaherty, the great neurologist

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
who kind of reads you like an MRI

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
She walked by me and I was saying

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I was telling this other actress and this pilot

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
we were doing based on this

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
neurologist from Harvard's life

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
and I said, I was telling

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
the story about, I passed out and I broke my nose

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
and she walked by and she goes

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
What? You passed out? When?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
When? How old were you?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I said I was 22 and she goes

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Had you just peed?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I said, yeah

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
and she goes, oh good

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
and she walked away

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I knew you were a Pisces

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
You know

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I fucked myself up man

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I had a cut across my ear

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
my cheek, my nose and the other cheek

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I went just wham

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
and you went into the bathroom

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
closed the door, locked it hopefully

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
shit so hard

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
that you passed out

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
and cut your face open

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I stood up too quickly

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I faint from time to time, my dad faints

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
my brother faints, we're tall, we're skinny

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
we get up and if we've just

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
eaten a lot or whatever

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
if we stand up too quickly

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
My dad, remember, fainted at channel 101

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
and I was all worried that my dad had a heart attack

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
the paramedic came

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
in a load chair, do you normally stay up this late?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Did you just eat a lot? Yeah

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
and did you stand up quickly? Yeah, you're fine

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
get the fuck out of here

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I faint from time to time

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
if I'm on low blood sugar

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
and stand up too quickly

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
So

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
everybody else in the Thanksgiving

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
family setting

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
goes, oh goodbye

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I'm gonna go take a shit, okay goodbye

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
and then you leave

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
and then like phone rings

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
and you're back on the door

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
hey, the phone's for you, you come in

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
come out, covered in blood

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
and they went, huh

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
it was just me and my grandma

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I had gone from the

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
it could only be one person

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
reacting to this

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
but she was like, Jeff, your phone's for you

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
and that's when I woke up and I see blood everywhere

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
and I go, tell them I'll call

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
find out who it is, I'll call them back

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
and I looked up and my face is just

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
covered in blood

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
it was a complete crime scene

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
were you still bleeding?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
oh yeah, I was still pouring blood

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
out of my cuts

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
so did you like go to the hospital

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
to get stitches?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I probably should have, I think I either glued it

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
probably glued it

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
like a skateboarder trick

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
hmm, Vietnam

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
hockey trick, yeah

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
it's a Vietnam trick

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
but then I like, I got one of those

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
little small like

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
band-aids, the little ones

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
the boxers got in a fight

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
yeah, like Bugs Bunny

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
and I had that across my nose

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I've never been a tough looking guy

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
but if you walk into a bar

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
even at 22, when I weighed

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
like 170 pounds

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
with the one across your nose

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
and a big shiner

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
people wouldn't even make eye contact

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
with me, I think I looked tougher

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
because like

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
like Bugs Bunny

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I'd be like, well he's vulnerable

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
when I was in high school

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
me and my friends used to like sword fight

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
with PVC pipes and one time

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
we had a tremendous

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
parry that blew up both of our pipes

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
and one of the shards

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
of PVC sliced into my face

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
and caused this like vertical

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
scar

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
going from my eye, like down

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
my cheek and like

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
like you see in cartoons and stuff

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
it had those little cross cut things

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
along it for whatever reason

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
and so like when I went to school

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
people were like, that's crazy, how'd you get in?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
and I was like, oh I was in a fight

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
and then people thought I was a total bad ass

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
did you get stitches for that?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
no, no, that was so weird

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
because I assume it was stitches but it's like

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
it just like naturally formed that in the scar

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
they got those little butterfly band-aids that are great

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
like I've cut myself pretty bad

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
and there's ones that you like stretch them out

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and they pull it back together

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
it's almost like a stitch

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
what do those have like extra

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I don't care about those

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
well I have nothing else to talk about

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
you hate stories about cut fingers

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
no, well I'm sure but you guys weren't

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
telling those, that's fine

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
you guys were doing great

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Schrab made

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Kiss Me on Monday

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
you know drinking coffee is a lot of fun

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
but you know it's not drinking fun

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
drinking coffee out of a mug that's not made by Rob Schrab

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
you made these Rob?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
yes

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
yeah, that's for you

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I brought them in for you

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Church, you have your new coffee mug at home

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
kiss me on Monday

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
kiss me on Monday

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Rob Schrab original

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
where do you get it Rob?

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
you get it at my tea public store

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
go to tea public

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
and use the honey add-on

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
to try and find a coupon code for it

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I saw that a guy commented on your

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
one of your things and he said

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
will there be any Cheapy Peepy t-shirts

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
applied to him

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
why would I make fake merch a piece of shit

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
like

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
yeah

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
why would I?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
what you're trying to say to that kid is you're not Cheapy Peepy

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
and you don't know what he's talking about

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
well we know that I'm not so why

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
why would this be a surprise to you

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
and why would you

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
why wouldn't I react

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
why would it be fake merch?

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
because I'm not

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
that word

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
does that make the merch fake?

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
am not that word

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
but the merch is real regardless of what you are

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
then make all the merch you want

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I'm not that word

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
are you enjoying the ipad pro

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
seems like you might want it

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I'm going through a bad time

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
I want to draw

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
but I can't do

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I can't force myself

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
so the ipad pro isn't something you're using right now

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I'm trying

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I just kind of lay around

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and do nothing

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
you still have Dan's ipad pro

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
yeah I'll give it back

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I mean

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I'll give it back

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
are you still testing it out?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
yeah

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
kind of

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I'll give it back

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I just did this whole

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
drama

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
this whole like

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
dragging me through

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
this fucking mud

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
and making this shame

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
every time I open it and look at it

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I just hear

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
you probably should return it

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
I feel bad about myself

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I can't even look you in the eyes

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
so now you've

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
talked about dragging people into the mud

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
so now you're

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
implying to me

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
that I've inhibited your creative throughput

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
no no no

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I was there long before

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
you got about

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
you didn't help it

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
but

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
you aren't responsible

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
so you don't like the ipad pro

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I don't like

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
he doesn't like the person who gave it to him

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I'm having a hard time with everything right now

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I don't like my laptop

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I don't like

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
my Apple TV

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
I don't like

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
you know whatever

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
I'm just

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
I could talk more about this off

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
mic

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I'm not

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I'll give it back

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I'll give it back

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
why would I

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
why would I make

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
a chibi

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
peepee anything

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I'm not saying you would make it

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I'm saying it wouldn't be fake merch

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
yes it would

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
you would have made a real piece of merch

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
that says the worst Cheapy Peepy

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
in that sentence

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I wouldn't have done that

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
so don't say you

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
it would have been fake because I didn't do it

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
we're too

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
in the hypothetical situation

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
where you did this you wouldn't have done it

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
I did though

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
I'm not going to

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
this is totally theoretical hypothetical

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
what if

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
if I came from

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
like a twilight zone

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
figure from outer space

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Schrab if you make

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Cheapy Peepy merchandise

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
you'll get 10 million dollars

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I don't want 10 million dollars

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
saying

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
something that is absolutely

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
hurtful

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
wrong

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
false shitty

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
why would I want to celebrate

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
him making

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
front of me

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
why would I want to put a spotlight on that

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
why would I want to

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
why would I

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
want to

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
but not for 10 million dollars

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
you wouldn't do it

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I'm not a hooker dude

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I'm not going to just

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
hold on to your principles

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
hold on to my principles

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
hold on to my principles

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
alright

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
not a hooker dude

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
that makes sense

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
why I would hurt you

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I could make 10 million dollars

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
all I have to do is not have any self esteem

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
there there

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
sounds like a good trade off

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I'm the one that's got to

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
look at me in the mirror in the morning

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
every morning

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I got to live with me the rest of my life

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
might as well cash in on

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
shit

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
30 million dollars

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
what am I going to spend 30 million dollars

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
you could use 100 million dollars

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
to make other people less cheap

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
you could create institutions

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
where you could teach kids to have

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
cool attitude about money

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I'm not cheap

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
anyway

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
alright

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
how's your fucking free coffee mug ass dick

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
oh boy

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
ass dick

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
how's your free coffee mug ass dick

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
there's going to be a set of mugs

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
that should be a t-shirt

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
as how's your free coffee mug ass dick

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
yeah it's funny it was not on a mug

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
it's a better bumper sticker or t-shirt

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
that's not how coffee mugs used to be

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
coffee mugs used to have to have

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
like a more banal

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
amount of

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
like invective to them

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
like a weekly for the weekend

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
but what you're really thinking is fuck this job

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
but like ranking dads

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
well

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
yeah I've never seen a number

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
two dad

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
worlds

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
second best father

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
those mugs get hidden

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
they're in the back

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
they get pushed to the back

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
behind the generic mugs

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
you ever go through a phase

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
where you're like you love your grandma right

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
and then like

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
you look back on it and go like oh yeah

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
there's kind of a

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
planets lined up and I was kind of like

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I wrote a letter to my grandma

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I was like you're a super grandma

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
and then like the next year it was like

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
all the previous years so it was like

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
grandma must have been like oh cool

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
this moment has arrived now these grandkids

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
are paying off let's put this on the fridge

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
better leave some space for the next year

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I think he's just like fuck this

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
this is a hard super grandma

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
what the fuck am I talking about

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
how do I even know I got one grandma

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I try to call her

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I know she's the shittiest one

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I try to call her like

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
every other week or something

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
you try to call your grandma every other week

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Jesus

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
or she'll call me

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
she'll call me like at 11.30 at night

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
and she just wants to talk

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I feel like nobody ever you're high-roading me

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
you don't give a fuck about your grandma

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
you don't give a fuck about your grandma

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
my grandma calls you

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
she's the only grandparent I have left

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
do you have any ex-grandparents

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
yeah I got

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
I'm not high-roading I'm just saying

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
alright

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
have you ever done

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I never

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
I don't know if you saw this

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
when you said I called my grandmother

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I talked to her once every other week

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Dan instantly just crossed his arms

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
instantly crossed his arms

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I wasn't yelling at him he goes

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
he said have you ever done

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
have you ever

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
done your grandma

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
right or whatever

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
and I answered and I go

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
and you go

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
whatever

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
I got some

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
grandparents that are alive

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
yeah I got so many

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
our relationships are great they all call

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
me regularly and I don't have to

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
maintain the relationships it's just so easy

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
you're doing exactly what they're

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
they give me gifts that I appreciate

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
and not off-color

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I've never had a meal by them

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
that tasted stale and disgusting

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
are you guys jumping into

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
a grandma loving barge

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
do you have grandparents around?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
yeah my grandmother is 95

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I still as vibrant as she ever was

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
and loves to cook and do some stuff

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
are you close? does she live nearby?

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
no she lives in Arkansas

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
and I

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
she can't see as well right now

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
but you could talk to her on the phone right?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I'll talk to her on the phone

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
yeah absolutely

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
that's what they're for

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
it must be real fucking nice

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
will you please help me out

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
what am I...

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
get him

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
he needs you to hate your grandma

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
someone like back me up

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
this is gross

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
it's so upsetting to hear normal family stories

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
oh so you were lying Spencer

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
oh yeah

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I was giving

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
an account of something that would be

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
impossible by most understandings

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
he was algorithmically mocking

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
your relationships with your grandmothers

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
oh that's cool

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
yeah

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
I didn't know you were doing that

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I'm sorry

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
that must be real hard

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
you must have to have one of your schedule calls

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
to talk about it

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
you're fucking low-roading

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
why don't you go take advantage

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
of your normal social or safety network

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
it's great

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
thank you

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Jesus Christ

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
there's nothing safe about loving someone

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
my grandpa's dead

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
it's great

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
minds are too

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
it's great right

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
you're in sixth grade fourth grade

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
all of a sudden all the other guys

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
they're all talking about showers

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
oh they love showering

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I can't believe it

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
you can't get enough water

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
dude I take three showers a day

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I take 90 showers a day

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
how did this happen overnight

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
we used to like being dirty

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
what happened here

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
why is this the new metric for how to be normal

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
I can't believe how many showers I take

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
look obviously if it's

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
an unconscious mechanism

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
if you just love showering

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
then fine

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
if you love your parents

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
if you love emotional

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
connections with people

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
then good for you

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
we're like figuring

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
we finally figured out

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
we're taking showers and then all of a sudden

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
it's relations with your grandparents

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
that everyone's talking about

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
we're just figuring out soap and conditioner

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
now it's grandparents

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
just in time for the grandparents to die

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
by the way

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
one mitigating factor

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
is that you had a grandma that may have murdered two people

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
that was my great grandma

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
that was my grandma's mom

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
well bring her around

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
it doesn't matter

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
did she ever convicted of murder

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
or was that just

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
only in hell

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
here's what all family is now

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
all family is just

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
bare traps

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
spread across social media

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
that you never know which one you're gonna snap off

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
hey

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
who's listening

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I don't

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
there is no

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
then you meet Cody's family

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
they love each other

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
they got a background together

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I don't know how

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
isn't there supposed to be some kind of foundation

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
am I the monster

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
am I the Hannibal Lecter

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
that's like oh how come family can't be eating

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
with fava beans

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
am I the one

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
because they're not calorically valuable

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I know

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I know who will tell you

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
the answer is yes

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
my family

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I'm sure they'd be like oh yeah

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
he's a weird one that one

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
what am I gonna take their word for it

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
but bones doesn't talk to your parents either

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
bones don't talk to nobody

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
bones don't need to talk to nobody

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
bones talking to nobody

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
never

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
his brother gave himself a nickname

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
he don't talk to me

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I don't talk to him

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
bones don't talk to nobody

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
nobody in my family would be talking to nobody

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
and like everybody's like

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
but then every once in a while somebody will have

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
a fucking coronary and then somebody will send

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
a facebook message to somebody going like

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
good to see you Grimm, Pappy, Pappy, Smaps

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I don't know you

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
then don't fuck with me

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
what are the legends

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
then I have no feelings

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
it's time for Levy

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
but what's the time Levy gets up here

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Levy get up here

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
oh

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Steve Levy

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
he's my favorite Levy

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Levy we're working on this

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
yeah I have it

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
where are you lifting

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
in a garage

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
sometimes in a gym

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
other times in a garage

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
where are you lifting

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
there's one in Noho

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
that I go to

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I don't know the name of it

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
you don't know the name of it

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
do you do that crossfit stuff

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I used to do crossfit

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I'm easing back here

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I'm doing weights right now

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
it's high intensity

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
multiple really fast

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
it's close to like NFL combine

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
yeah so just a bunch of different things

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
high intensity

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
it's like NFL combine

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
it's like NFL combine

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
you do like 30 burpees

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
and then you go jump through things

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
it's like circuit training

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
you do a bunch of different things

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
can I do a little business before I forget

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I want to plug

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
this thing that star burns audio is doing

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
what used to be frail is no star burns audio

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
and there's a thing that's happening called

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
like these tapes are coming out

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
you know about this

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
yeah

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
so real quick

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
and for 20 bucks a month

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
it's like the VIP level thing

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
it comes with an actual old school Walkman

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
and extra tracks 13 bucks a month

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
you just get a tape of the month kind of thing

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
if you go to

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
d.rip

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
forward slash sbi-press

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
dot com all over a case

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
you get monthly tapes

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
there's Johnny Pemberton's prank call tape

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Ron Lynch double tape which sounds amazing

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
you have to play two tapes at once

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
and he's a fucking lunatic and I love him

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
you get Dino Stamatopoulos's music

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
sorry about everything

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
there's also a tape of Dan Harmon's

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
all the Dan Harmon.wn raps are going to be on tape

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
so if you like the Harmontown thing

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I'm doing a thing called the Jeff Davis library

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
there's a million other things

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Neil Hamburger a bunch of motherfuckers

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
tape sound effect

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
so go to

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
sbi-press

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
they have a facebook page and check it out

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
and Simon already is the man

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
that's in charge of that and he's a bad motherfucker

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
so dig it

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
or check out the ad that we'll play at the end of the episode

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
are we doing one? probably

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
I love it

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
it'll be great

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
if what was that then

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I don't know

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I have no idea what that just was

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
it sounded like

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
an ad

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
it did yeah

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
have you ever had suicidal ideations

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Spencer? oh yeah

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
more in high school what do you mean by ideations

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
like thinking about it how'd you do it

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
ideas

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
oh god

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
no no no god ideations

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
what is it if I said

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
thinking about it

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
instead of ideas

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
because guess what

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
if your language is practical

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
you could just go

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
uh when you like something

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
uh uh when you don't

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
pedampion yeah

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
you're gonna need new ones so ideations

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
means not just ideas

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
because ideas could mean oh I came up with an idea

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
of how to kill myself

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
ideation like are you having

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
suicidal thoughts

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
why not just say thoughts

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I'm old

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
language janitor I'm Rob Schwab

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I'm gonna clean up

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
6000 years of organic

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
evolution of language

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
it's a brother

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
it's a living thing yeah brother

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
you ever go to art school

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
think of it like a little bit

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
like a jawa or something you draw

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
it's terrible

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
what do you draw like an apple

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
so if I said did you ever have

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
any suicidal ideas

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
or thoughts

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
you wouldn't know what I was talking about

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
oh god

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
you would be like

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
oh no

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
I have a glaze in your heart

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
he covered like oh no

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
I have a glaze

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
I don't know what you're talking about

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
but see how much time you

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
saved by saying it

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
your way

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
we've got the answer

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
from what Spencer said

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
oh no we don't

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
because we've been talking

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
about

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
this word

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
there's a million ways to say everything

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
and I

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
yeah

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
but the way that you said was bad

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
apparently

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
but you would have known what I meant

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
and we could have moved on you can say anything

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
any way you want thank you

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
thank you for permission

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
thanks for permitting me

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
every time we choose a way

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
to say a word we should stop down

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
and explore alternate ways

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
we could have said that phrase or sentence

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
by the way it's also like a tag

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
like a kid could type in suicidal ideation

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
instead of suicidal ideas

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
if they type in suicidal ideas

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
they might get half of them schematics

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
for how to kill yourself

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
if they type in ideation maybe it takes them to

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
more crisis lines

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I'm gonna test this theory

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
I'm gonna go home

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
and I'm gonna type both then

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
this could be huge for you

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
blown away by the difference

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I'm gonna be just

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
event one

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
big bang

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
blown away by the difference

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
look I don't want to care about

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
people anymore either

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I have a shit story

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
hell yeah

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
tell me more

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I think this could be the most

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I was

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
I was 14 I was in eighth grade

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
so middle school

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
not quite high school yet

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
and my grandparents they lived on Long Island

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
we had

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
we were visiting we had like Chinese food

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
or something

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
we lived in New Jersey

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
and it was about hour and change to get back

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
home

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
and we had a

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Chrysler Town and Country minivan

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
it's a 2

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
7

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
so you have the 2 front of the seat

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
driver passenger and then

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
2 seats behind those

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
seats and then a bench in the back

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I need you guys to understand

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
a bench what?

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
like a 3 person

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
you have to understand the full geography

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
if this car

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
drops you off at DeMorge's charter plane

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
wait I just want you guys to understand

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
you guys

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
so

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
my dad's

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
that was an option

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
but we didn't have the wood paneling

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
my dad was driving my mom was in the passenger seat

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
my brother who was 2 years younger

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
than me so he was

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
12 was

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
sitting behind my mom was in the passenger seat

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
my sister is in her car seat so

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
she's 9 years younger than me so she's like

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
5 and then I'm behind

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
my brother in the

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
in the back seat

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
big family

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
in the

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
in the very back of the minivan

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
you're 14 years old

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
if this story culminates

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
and you diarying

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
in a fan and we

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
are supposed to be laughing because we realized

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
your sister got hit first

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
we have a right to go we didn't retain

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
the bird's eyes

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
but just so you understand

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I'm in the very back

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
my siblings are in the middle

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
you get a big family

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
whatever

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
it's very

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
it's visceral for me because

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
it's haunted me

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
so we're driving

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
back to New Jersey

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
from Long Island and my stomach

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
starts hurting and I'm like oh no

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
this could be potentially bad

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I think I could maybe wait it out but

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
there's so much traffic

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
on the cross Bronx and it's like

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
not great areas driving through

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
and I'm starting to go like

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
can we stop

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I'm sorry

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
like northern Jersey Mars County

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
from

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
from

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
from Long Island

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
at least eat the mic if you're gonna

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
do more just New York thoroughfare bullying him

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
he's like you took the

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
you took the Bronx from the tunnel at the Lincoln

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
you know it's like a sad

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
it's like a sad

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
but I was a kid I mean I felt like I could

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I could

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I just felt like I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
soon

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
you guys just found after four

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
what

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
yeah

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
so

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
so we're driving and I'm like okay

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
I think I might have to go to the bathroom

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
can we stop somewhere soon

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
and my dad and my mom are going

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
look we're stuck in traffic and this is not a great

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
area to stop anywhere

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
it's late at night already we don't know

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
what's gonna be open just try to hold it you'll be fine

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
I was like okay I'm holding it I'm holding it

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
we keep going we're getting closer

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
to like the George Washington bridge which

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
takes you from New York to New Jersey

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
and now your siblings they're

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
tuned in are they merciful are they

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
they're leaving are they like hey buddy

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
no no I mean I'm not

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
yet complaining to the point where it's a problem

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I'm just going cleared your throat

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
at this point yeah I'm voicing

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
what's happening a little bit just like

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
hey just a heads up well there was a

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
conversation though where they said could you hold it

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
and they knew it wasn't number one they knew it

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
was number two yeah

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I was like look I really got to go

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
so then you're simply your siblings aren't like

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
this yeah yeah

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000

I'm not I mean it didn't hit that

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
point it didn't hit like maybe it's a loving

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
family maybe it's a loving family so

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
so we're going to get closer to the bridge

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000

an invisible touch

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
she takes control

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000

it's just like diarrhea flowing out of me

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
and the worst noises and I just

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
remember my brother going oh my god oh my god

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
and my sister going ew it smells

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
she's fucking five years old

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
ew open a window

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
open a window

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
well of course open a window

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
my sister's right

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
like who thought

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
seal us in

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
but it's like freezing winter time

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
no one cares if George Washington

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
had been watching

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
he'd be like open all the windows

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
so I mean this happens

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
I felt like an eternity

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
and then finally the pain but then it's like

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
you can't sit down

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
back on that seat also like

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
nothing to fucking wipe with

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
there's no napkins nothing

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
bag full of diarrhea

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
but for the rest of the life

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
it was explosive I have no idea

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
what happened

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
and there's no spots on the bridge to just pull over

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
no even just for

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
your traps and I'm just hovering over and we finally

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
get over the George Washington bridge

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
and my dad gets off and he makes a right and we

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
get to this KFC to

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
assess the damage and we turn on the lights

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
and it's just

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
it's just

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I maybe got like

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
if I was lucky 60% in the bag

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
and not only that

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
but

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
and I

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
and it was like it was all

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
it was all over my boxers and everything

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I just remember my dad taking the bag out of the car

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
with my boxers and just

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
throwing in a dumpster behind KFC

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
and we just drove home silently

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I only just wanted to be at the

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Nordstroms that the bag came from

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
the Marshalls

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
and we

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
we get home and my mom is just like

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I'm so sorry that happened

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
she's like why don't you go upstairs

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
and just clean off and go lie in bed

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
and she cleaned the back seat

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
of the car because I missed it so much

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
in the bag

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
and it was traumatizing

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
and my family will never

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
forget that it happened

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
but they all laugh at it

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
everyone's an older brother

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
so you don't have any older siblings

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Jordan's two years younger than me

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
and my sister's

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
nine years younger than me

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
and that's just the three

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
but so yeah so now

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
everybody remembers it now it's funny

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
like it's not like it causes you pain to remember it

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
except to the place where you transport back

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
you're like that own that story

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
it was embarrassing at that time

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
it's like you know you're trying to like

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I can't believe the little brother wasn't fucking dying

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
no he was just like

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
if Jeff Schrab was taking a shit in the back seat

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I would have been

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
dying laughing

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
yeah but not when you started to smell it though

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
that's his little sister

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
she's like it stinks

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
she's like I get it now

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
there's consequences

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
and then someone's like

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
rolled out a window yeah you think

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
yeah your family

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
sucks

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
just kidding I love my grandparents

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I call them once a week

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I talk to my mom

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
but also my dad

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
you know what else are you shitting bags

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
why didn't

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
couldn't they just stop dead

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
on the bridge

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
no the tunnels there's nowhere to stop

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
no you stop

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
but then throw the bag of diarrhea

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
out into the bridge

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
that's awful

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Henry portrait of a serial killer

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
you stop on the bridge

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
and then you get out

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
and then you shit outside

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
your upholstered car

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
with all the cars

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
slowly passing on

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
dude I don't think it's legal for me to

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
diarrhea on the George Washington bridge

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
imagine the car

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
is going 10 miles an hour

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
you're imagining

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
it's probably going to freeze

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
it's all stopped

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
they're not at all stopped

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
it's a big long bridge and imagine them going like the speed of a

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
but I feel like there's stops and

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
starts you know with traffic

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
if you're stopping at all then you just stop

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
and be like it's going to take a minute instead

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
at 10 seconds

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I think if there were any other

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
option than him shitting a bag

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
in the backseat I think they would have taken that option

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I don't think they took it seriously

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
and that's why the situation unfolded the way it did

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
I think there are options

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
on the table that were not fully explored

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
the options were to pull off in the Bronx

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
and like try to find a

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
local

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
well that you should have done

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
once you're on the bridge

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
you tried to make it onto the bridge

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
you've got our sympathies once you're on the bridge

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
right don't tell us

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
you weren't willing to take a shit in the Bronx

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
or you become the villain

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
I was willing but it was late

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
it was like 10 o'clock at night so where do you

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
they don't know

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
it could not pull over in the Bronx because judgment night

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
was still in theaters

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Dennis Larry would still

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
come for you

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
but no I mean I'm just saying

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
as much as it might be the case

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
like a bridge everyone's like I get it

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
the bridge Spencer

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
is fascinating me because he's picturing the bridge

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
in a very nuanced way

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
the thing about a car in front of you

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
is it's an impassable obstacle

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
you can't drive through a car

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
because it's not obeying traffic laws

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
you simply have to stop

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
so if they had to shit that

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
bad that you stopped your car

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
in the middle of traffic the cars behind you

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
would stop

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
would it instantly cause a car

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
at any age 14 years old

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
till now would rather shit in the car

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
as my family than get out and shit in front of a punch

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
in New York

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I think you're picturing

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
bumper to bumper

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
or like stop and start traffic

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
it's like there's a

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
medium split there where it's like

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
it's like a conveyor belt you're not going to

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
let your kid go out

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
could you just sit on the edge

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
of the bridge

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
and get a newspaper

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
and just kind of

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
find a way to

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
I wasn't that confident

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
this was my fourth line item

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
this was a town and country minivan right

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
sliding door

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
couldn't you just hang it up

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
like you're painting the other line

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
see if we were your family

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
this would be handled

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
if your family had been Spencer's

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
they would have said look

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
stop the car

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
the kid goes out takes a shit in the snow

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
on the side of the George Washington bridge

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
and people who honk

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
like the Spencer in the front like goes back

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
and goes like look the kid is

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
having diarrhea would you rather

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
him have it in my car

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
and then they keep honking and the dad goes

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
keep honking it won't make his diarrhea

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
right exactly this is exactly what I expect to be

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
happening and everyone's fine

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
and then the kid the good the upside of that is

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
that the kid gets back in the car and he's like

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
my dad fucking loves me

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I mean it's got my back

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
either way I was going to diarrhea

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
it's just how much

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
how much we're going to put out everybody else

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
to the car

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
do we take on that burden ourselves or share it with the rest of the George Washington bridge

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
New York

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Spencer surely you understand

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
people are shitting everywhere already

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
New York has a schedule

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
New York you got

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
you got the uptown

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
you got the midtown

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
and then people are like honk honk honk

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
and he's like I'm shitting over here

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
right well that's I'm shitting here

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
but you guys are here

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
you guys are referring to a man who

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
didn't stop

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
he said I'm walking here

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
that means I'm getting out of your way here

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I'm almost through

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
you can't say I'm shitting here that means I'm

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
staying here if Dustin Hoffman's

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
line in midnight cowboy had been I'm

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I'm standing here

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
that movie would have ended 20 minutes

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
into it would have been better

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
well yeah I've

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
never seen it but I understand it to be pretty boring

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
isn't it just two guys like

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
running around doing drugs and sleeping

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
with people

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
apparently that was improvised

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
the car that pulls up was not supposed to be in the shot

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
and he actually rifted that line

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
oh wow well that makes it good

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
he was walking there

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
but the guy in the backseat of that car was taking a giant poop

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
is that why you're Diarrhea Jr

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
in our pathway

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I mean could be

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
not intentionally but yeah that sounds like an origin story

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
alright well we definitely

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
then yeah we don't have to play D&D anymore

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I was D&D I think

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
we did the whole podcast

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
we book ended this Harmontown

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
with prostate massage and

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
poop stories all I wanted to talk about was the

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
prostate thing

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
I feel like as usual

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I found out who my real friends are

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I like your hair

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
and your beard harmonies looking good

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
you're looking more and more like a combination

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
of several of the captains on Deadliest Catch

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
I'm not going to let that

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
make me trust you

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
I like the sound of it

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
you remind me of you

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
you look like you might go into the

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Bering Sea and you know

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
the Bering Sea gives up its gold

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
you mean crab Jesus Christ

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
how many ways are you going to trick me to think

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
the show isn't boring

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
fucking A

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
alright there's more crab coming out

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
the Bering Sea

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
gives up its gold

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
crab you mean say crab

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
please their language won't you

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I don't watch the show

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I watch an episode in the hotel

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I don't watch a lot of TV hotel TVs

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
I watched an episode of Wicked Tuna

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
and one of the boats

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
they're all from Massachusetts one of the tuna boats

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Wicked Pissa

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
but Jeff you want to promote

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
you don't want to promote but I want to check out

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
this like Forge and Fire reality show

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Oh yeah

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Forge and Fire

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
and Church and I

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
I made Church watch some

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Forge and Fire is good fun

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
it's a bunch of dudes that are all clearly

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
like kind of

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
spectrumy nerds

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
who like probably cosplay

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
or they're not good around people

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
and they have a Forge and they have to make

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
historical weapons and it's great

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
it's a testament to our society

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
that

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
we are murdering so many people

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
per minute that

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
you can now unlike in the

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
80s when

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Dungeons and Dragons was of concern to parents

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
because it simulated the idea of

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
edged weapons

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
you can now have a reality show on TLC

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
or whatever it's like yes

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
this axe which I recommend

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
you kids at home try making

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
because

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
you'll only be able to kill one person

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
per police taser

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
it's like chops the show is like chops

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
but hilariously the name chops

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
was already taken so they can't go

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
sorry like one of your blades

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
is not up to snuff you've been

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
chopped that would be perfect but they've already

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
took that for a cooking show so they go your blade

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
did not make the cuts but the whole point

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
anyone wants to be on that show is Doug

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Makeda the Asian

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
martial artist edged weapon master

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
will do a kill

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
test on a ballistics demi with fake ribs

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
and blue gel organs

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
he'll just take a viking

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
battle axe and

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
kill a fake person and it's

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
chop a hog in half and they go your blade

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
will kill

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
that's the

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
that's the you're fired of

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
your blade

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
will kill

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
and you actually want to hear it

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
a double headed battle axe
