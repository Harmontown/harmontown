getting better at\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:37.000\nFocusing in on the 90 words\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:39.000\nThat rhyme with each other\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:42.000\nMaybe Eminem feels the same way\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:43.000\nNo, he doesn't\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:44.000\nCause he'll say\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nStill your mom is Acura\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:48.000\nWrecked it, gave it back to

I'm just thinking\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:58.000\nI just learned to stay away from the word\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nNot in a tempo\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.000\nJust rhyme\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nBe Eminem for a minute\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:06.000\nAnd just try to freestyle rhymes for Acura\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:08.000\nThat are kind of loosely rhyming\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:10.000\nI don't know, it's got bacula\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:12.000\nYeah, that's great\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:13.000\nSure, guys\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:15.000\nI mean, obviously\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:16.000\nSo you can do it\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:17.000\nYou have that muscle too\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:18.000\nNow let's hit that beat again\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:20.000\nPut that beat back up\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:22.000\nNow just let it\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:23.000\nSo just be phonetic\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nJust think phonetically\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:26.000\nNo, we'll just do better\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:29.000\nJust be real good to true rhymes\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nSo you guys, you have my best interest\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:32.000\nAbsolutely\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:35.000\nLike, you know, this isn't some kind of side show\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:37.000\nNo, that's not true at all\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:38.000\nI'm supporting you right now\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:40.000\nIn order for me to be better at what I do\n\n02:40.000

02:55.000\nThree and a half years for this very moment\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:56.000\nTo take you down\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:57.000\nTonight is the night\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:59.000\nLet's just, Joe, come

03:10.000\nYo\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:11.000\nThe snow blow\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:12.000\nIn the driveway\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:13.000\nGonna fuck your mama\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:14.000\nGonna do it the right way\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:15.000\nSee, I can't\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:16.000\nYeah, you did it\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:17.000\nThe right way in the right way\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nYou did?\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:19.000\nYeah\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.000\nThat's the same thing\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nIt's the same thing I was doing before\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:25.000\nBut you said that after you had Scott Bakula\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:27.000\nRight way, right way\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:28.000\nWe got a big show tonight\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:29.000\nWe got a lot of guests\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:30.000\nWe got a lot of old friends\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\nWe got better shit to do than to fuck with me\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nNo one's fucking with you, Dan\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:36.000\nWe're here to support you\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:38.000\nMaybe I've been drinking\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:41.000\nThe only topic that I have to address tonight\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nIs I want to talk about prostate massage\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.000\nThank God\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nSo if you think that we can get\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.000\nThrough everything else we have to do tonight\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nAnd still address it\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nWhy don't we get that out of the way\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:54.000\nLet's leave the prostate massage\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nAnd then we'll bring our guests up\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nWe're gonna need a lot of time for this\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nAre you saying do we want the guests on stage\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nFor this prostate massage conversation?\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nWell, I guess I'll\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:04.000\nLet's bring up Rob Schrab\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:05.000\nRob Schrab\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:12.000\nI'm not saying he's the prostate massage of guests\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:22.000\nOr that he's an expert in it\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:23.000\nHello\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:24.000\nOh, yeah\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nWe got beard growing Schrab\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:28.000\nAlways a pleasure\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nIs it my Logan phase?\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nLike it\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nJealous\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:33.000\nJealous of its lustrousness\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nWhat phase is Jeff going through?\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:36.000\nYou got a haircut\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:39.000\nYeah, I'm going through my haircut phase\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:41.000\nYou're a guy, Pierce\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:45.000\nI'm going through my L.A. confidential\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:48.000\nLike 5 and under phase\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:49.000\nAlright, well if you're a fan of mine\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:50.000\nAnd you are\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nOne of the things that you know about me\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:55.000\nIs that once in the late 90s\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nI experimented having heard about\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nThe stimulation of the prostate\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:02.000\nAs an extra option\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nAt the country buffet of jerking off\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:06.000\nI took a Sharpie pen\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:09.000\nAnd put the non-cap end up my rectum\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nWhile jerking off\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nWhich I usually do on my knees anyway\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nSo I was kneeling on a pen\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nAnd kind of like moving it around\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nAnd it did feel a little extra good\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nAnd I came the way I usually do\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:23.000\nThrough my penis\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nAnd then I never\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:26.000\nThat was the last time I did it\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:27.000\nBecause then I had come\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nAnd I was kneeling on my bed\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:30.000\nWith a pen up my ass\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nAnd I had to get pulled out\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nWas there a mirror in front of you?\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nNo, that's not something that I think\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nWould ever add for me to the sexual experience\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nWell, I don't think you would put it there\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nOn purpose\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:43.000\nThere I am\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nThere you are, air wolf\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:49.000\nBut so I always thought of it like\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nOkay, guys have assholes\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:52.000\nWomen have assholes\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:53.000\nTrue\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:54.000\nEveryone has an asshole\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nAnd that guys, because they're homophobic\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:00.000\nAssholes are Mars, vaginas are Venus, I think\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:03.000\nThat guys, because they're homophobic\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nWe just associate, we've been socialized\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nTo not be like, what are you doing with my butthole?\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:10.000\nAnd then other people would be like\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.000\nNo, there's just as many nerve endings up there\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nAs there is in the outside of your dick\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nOr the pussy\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nLike whatever, it's all science\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:21.000\nAnd I've been content to be like\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nYeah, I'm not interested in anal things or anything\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:28.000\nBut the, so here, I just typed it in\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nAnd I don't know why\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:32.000\nBecause I remember a conversation with a friend of mine\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nWho, no, well there was, that was the first\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nProstate conversation I ever had was with a Schrab\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:39.000\nPut a pin in that\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nI'll put a sharpie in that\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:50.000\nI remember a writer on one of my empire's shows\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:54.000\nGoing like, well have you ever had your prostate milked?\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nAnd I went, no\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nAnd he's like, yeah I did that with so and so\n\n06:58.000 --> 06:59.000\nHis girlfriend\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nAnd so they, you know\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nAnd then he described this thing\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nAnd it was like, you said prostate milk\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nSo I'm not gonna, I'm just gonna support you\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nAnd I'll think about it later\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nSo then I googled it\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:17.000\nSo your prostate is a, first of all\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:18.000\nWomen don't have them, did you know that?\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nNo\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nYeah, I did\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nI just found that out\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nPretty, pretty sure\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nI guess I figured that out in my head\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nThey don't die of prostate cancer\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:27.000\nThey never do\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nWell you know what the prostate does, right?\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:31.000\nWell it does, it's the muscle\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nIt's the pump on the aquarium\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nI mean it puts the pee out\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nIt releases for the pee to come out\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:43.000\nAnd then it pumps your, a third of your\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nIt does the whole pumping motion\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nOf everything that makes everything go out\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nAnd it also provides as a gland\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:53.000\nA third of the total\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nSeminal fluid\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nIngredients of seminal fluid\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nHell yeah\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nSo apparently the prostate\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nBut it builds shit up\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nBut I don't know if these are websites\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nThat are just selling you\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nSpamware\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.000\nAnal tools\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nAnd dressing the whole\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:12.000\nCause they're all kind of geocities looking\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nAnd there's like a gift of a nurse\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nLike going like, yeah this is important for you\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nAre these sponsored ads that you're reading?\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:19.000\nLike\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nI don't know how I got it\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nI think I typed prostate milking into Google\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nAnd then I started surfing\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nAs the kids call it\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nImage search\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nOn the reg\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nAnd what the people that would\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:35.000\nKeep in mind these are people who are selling you\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nThings that you put in your butt\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nSo they want you to put something in your butt\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nI don't know, they might be on the side of\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nIt's in their best interest that you do\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nThat you put something in your butt\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:45.000\nRight\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:46.000\nSo they're gonna say\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\nRun by big butt stuff\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nBig butt stuff\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:52.000\nBut apparently I never\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nWhen I put the Sharpie in my butt\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nI wasn't doing it right\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:57.000\nBecause you can go to reddits\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nWhere people are talking about\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nThe prostate orgasm\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nLike the milky prostate\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:04.000\nLike you put something in your butt\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:05.000\nRight\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nAnd you wiggle it around the right way\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nYou like massage the prostate\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nFrom the inside of your butt hole\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nAnd eventually you'll have an almost\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nTo a guy\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nWhat feels like an involuntary\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nShuddering orgasm\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:18.000\nRight\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nThat has nothing to do with\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nWhen you do the other thing\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nIt's like a different thing\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:25.000\nWhere you're like whoa\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nAnd there's like an earthquake\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nAnd then there's guys on subreddits\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nGoing like trust me\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.000\nLike I get it\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nYou don't want to put a thing in your butt\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nBut you show\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nGuys\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nAnd I just am 45 years old\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nAnd I just encountered it\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nShould we make podcast history right now?\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nWell I think we need\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nWe'll make podcast history next week\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:51.000\nWhen you said earlier\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nThat when you put the sharpie\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nIn your butt\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nDid you\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nAnd you said you did it wrong\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nWell just I\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nWhat's the right way to stick a sharpie\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:04.000\nIn your butt\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:05.000\nRight that's what I was pushing back against\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nYou did it just fine\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:07.000\nDon't worry\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:08.000\nWell no I did everything\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nAs long as you didn't hurt yourself\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\nEveryone that does something\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:11.000\nDoes something just fine\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:12.000\nWell you came didn't you\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nThe sharpie wasn't designed to milk your prostate\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nWhen guys are talking about putting stuff\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nIn their butts\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nThey're not just saying\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nOh there's a hole there that feels good\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nWhen you stick stuff in it\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nThat there's also a thing\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nThere's a G spot in there\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nBut let's not rush too quickly past\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nYou can like rub\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nIt's great to put stuff in your butt\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:32.000\nSure\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nEveryone loves it\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nIt's great to put stuff in your ear too\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nYou don't need to milk nothing\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nTo just shove a bunch of shit up your ass\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nIt's great to let your cat outside\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nBut you're not supposed to do that\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:46.000\nIt's great to have a milk shake\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nFor dinner\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:49.000\nYeah\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:50.000\nI mean look\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:51.000\nWhere's this Russia\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nYou're going through some shit\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:57.000\nI add ice cream and apple pie\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nFor breakfast\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:04.000\nOh boy\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.000\nWhat if that was the end of the podcast\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nWe just actually\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nIt was the first\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:11.000\nGreat if we had credits to roll\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nIs the end of the podcast\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nRob are you lying\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nOr did you really have that\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nNo I ate it\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nWhy would you make that up\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nAnd then do that mic drop\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nBoth\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nLike vegan ice cream\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nAnd vegan cake\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:27.000\nBoth got in from Whole Foods\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nWhere they sell the whole food\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:34.000\nLike if you wanted to get 2% of milk\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nThey would just give you the whole milk\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nIf you wanted to get half a sandwich\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nThey would say no\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nYou have to take the whole sandwich\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nIf you wanted to have\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nYou know like\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:46.000\nWhat if\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:47.000\nYou're like Reese's Pieces\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.000\nNo\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nYou have to have the whole Reese\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nThis is Whole Foods\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nWe don't have pieces or halves\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nOr 2% of anything here\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nYou want grapes\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nSure\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nThat's the gimmick of the story\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nIs that their only milk is 100% milk\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nYeah\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:08.000\nIt's the Whole Foods\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:09.000\nSo if you\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:10.000\nLet's say I walked into Whole Foods\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nAnd said I need some half and half\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nNo\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nNo\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nGo across the street\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nAnd have two gallons of it\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nAnd you can mix them together\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nYeah\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nIn one gallon\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nBecause we're going to give you\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nWhole milk\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nI have to take one half\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nCan I buy the one half of the one part of it\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nAnd the other half of the other part of it\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nI'll have to talk to my manager\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nThat is highly unorthodox\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nIt's called being a fur trapper\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nThat's what the story would become\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nIt would become a trading post\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nWhere a guy draped in fur\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:41.000\nWas like what do you want\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nYou wanted a cow udder filled with\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nEverything milk has in it\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nBefore you remove some\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.000\nOr would you like a shoe made out of a log\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nBecause a shoe is what is that\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nThat's just a peered down log\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nYour plan is bullshit\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nWhatever you want\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nYou can't have it\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nIt's not how it works\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nSo you see the prostate is like a plum sized\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nLike growth\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nPlum?\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nWell not a growth\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nIt's like a plum\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:10.000\nThey say it's the size of a plum\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nThat if you put something in your butt\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:13.000\nLike a finger\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:14.000\nLike your own finger\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nYou can reach up toward your belly button\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nAnd you can feel something\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nThe size of a plum\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nI'm sure you can feel all sorts of stuff\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nAnd they say don't rub the middle of it\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nDon't rub the middle of it\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:28.000\nDon't rub the middle of it\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nRub each clove\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nRub each like\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nChemistry\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nLike don't rub the middle\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nThe middle hurts more than it does anything\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nIt's got lobes\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nThe idea is that you get your prostate\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.000\nIt's more than a muscle\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nIt's like a factory\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nIt's making a third of your cum\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nIt's mostly a factor\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nI'm surprised like the way that you know it is this\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nUrine pump is very strange to me\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nI don't want to use this card\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nBut I grew up in the 80s brother\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nIt's always interesting to pump\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nAll we had to know\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.000\nSpencer when I was your age\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.000\nYou know what we had to know\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nWho forms the head in Voltron\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nThat's what we had to know\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nWho forms the head in Voltron\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nThe yellow lion probably\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nWhatever\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nYou know why don't you shoot up a school\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nI thought of it\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nAlright alright\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nWhy don't the rest of you put it on the comment card\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nOkay alright\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nNo that's good\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nI was saying that his generation\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nYou can't say that that came out of me\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nI was accusing him of it\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nYeah\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nWho do you think was\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nWho do you think was the Christopher Columbus\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nOf\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nFrostate Massage\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nWell remember you told me\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nYou gotta try it\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nThat when you rub the\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nYour taint\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nIt like\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nWhat it doesn't what\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nNow I just do it\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\n25 years of coming\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nAnd now I just my hand goes there\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nBecause Rob Schrab told me something once\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nPlease don't be thinking about that\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nWhile you're doing it\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nOh yeah\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nI'm masturbating\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nI don't do it anymore\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nI have one story about this\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nBut I feel weird telling it\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nBecause church is sitting right there\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nOh don't say it\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nShe's not listening\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nChurch do you want to step inside\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nChurch didn't do it\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nThis is like from when I was 19\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nOh to be cool there I didn't think the church did it\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nYeah\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nThere was a girl\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nWhen I was like 22\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nShe stood up in there with her finger\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nAnd did something I don't know what she did\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nI couldn't describe if there was lobes\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nOr clothes or whatever the flimflam\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nBut all I know is I came\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:46.000\nFor three days\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nLike a laser beam\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nWait for three days\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nIt was not like a regular pulsing guy\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nOrgasm\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nIt was just this\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nLike\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nThe death star blowing up\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nAlderaan\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nThe beam of orgasm\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nShe went up there\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nAnd found this magic button\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nOf my butthole\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nI never knew there were different things\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nLook you seem exasperated\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nWhich is insane\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nI was holding my breath for a while\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nAnd I breathed\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nYou want to talk\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nNo I didn't\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nI had nothing to say\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nWhat am I doing wrong\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nDan\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nYou want me to change the lighting\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nWhat am I doing wrong\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nHow can I make you seem crazy\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nYou were acting crazy\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nYou were like gaspings\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nNo I'm not even\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nHe was like\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nThis is not how prostate touching should be\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nAnd I'm about to explain what it should be\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nThank you\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nI threw you under the bus and pretended you were a clone\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nI picked up that signal from him\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nI thought he had something to say about it\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nHow much stuff have you ever put in your butt\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nTo what effect\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nTo what effect\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nWell I told you about the time\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nWhen the doctor put the thing in my butt\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nWhen I was asleep\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nI woke up\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nIn the middle of it\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nThey were making fun of you\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nNo they weren't\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nI pretended to be asleep though\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nAnd they were making fun\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nDan\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nYou're misremembering\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nI pretended to be asleep\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nSo I could\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nFind out\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nIf they were making fun of me\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nAnd they never did\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nBut then somebody sent\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nAll of us like\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nMan records on his phone\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nThe doctor is making fun of him\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nWhile he's asleep\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nThree Rob Schrab stories\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nBack to back\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nThis is for the people who haven't just finished\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nListening to 350 episodes\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nIn a row\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nBut if this is your first time here\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nPretend there's a snow storm\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nWhy Rob Schrab\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nHere's the three best Rob Schrab stories in the world\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nFirst one is\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nSchrab\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nThere was a\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nLet's start with that one so people don't think I'm insane\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nYou're just saying\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nLike\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nYou're leaving me\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nI don't know what we're grabbing\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nYou're pointing\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nI don't know what that means\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nI'm sorry\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nBut Schrab\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nThere's this song called Space Oddity\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nWas that the 80s song coming Major Tom\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nAre you receiving?\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nMajor Tom\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nOr not Space Oddity\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nIt's called Major Tom\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\n5, 3, 2, 1\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nYes\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nI've told this story before\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nThere's a verse in the song\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nWhen the astronaut\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nIs drifting into space\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nAnd he goes\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nAnd then they go across the stratosphere\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nThe signal comes in\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nAnd this is Major Tom\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nCommunicating to ground control\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nHe goes\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nGive my wife my love\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nThen nothing more\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nAnd that's the dramatic point where\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nThey lose contact with Major Tom\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nAnd Schrab\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nThought that there was Major Tom\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nSaying don't fuck my wife\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nYeah\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nGive my wife my love\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:20.000\nNot yours\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nJeremy\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nGive my wife my love\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nAnd leave it at that Kyle\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nNo more\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nJust give her the message\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nAnd take her home\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nOkay, you know\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nAnd then there's a Diet Coke one\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nThat I told a thousand times\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nWhere the guy on the set\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nOf Heat Vision of Jack\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nThe medical guy is talking to us\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nAnd Schrab goes I'm drinking too much\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nI gotta stop drinking so much Diet Coke\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nAnd the medical guy goes\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nYeah, well you know it makes your dick soft\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nAnd Schrab goes really?\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nAnd the guy's like\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nWell, yeah\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nA study show\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nYeah, it does, it makes your dick soft\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nJust so you know, and Schrab goes\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nWould he just pour it over it?\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nAnd it wasn't\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nI'm not telling stories about funny jokes\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nNo, no, no\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nI'm telling stories about the moment\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nSee, this is a different fucking world\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nYou're putting it up already\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nIt makes your dick soft\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nAnd I said, you mean like silk?\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nYeah, like velvet, like no, yeah\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nIf you just pour it over it, it's just become like\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nVelvet, yeah, no, you're right\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nI said silk, you're adding velvet\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nAnd changing the story\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nWhich is softer you guys think?\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nSilk or velvet?\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nIt's fucking silk, man\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nSilk\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nWhy did I launch into

it turns out\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nIf you stick a finger up your ass\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nYou have a different kind of\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nOrgasm\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nIt has nothing to do with your other orgasm\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nAre you going to explore this at home?\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.000\nI don't know about that\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nI'll update

21:20.000\nYou would do it again\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nYou don't know\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nNo, I'm saying like when I did it with the Sharpie\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nI didn't do\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nI didn't do the thing that they\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nI thought you said you just recently\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nNo, I didn't do, I was reading about

to cut you off there\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nBut if we're going to talk to anybody about this\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nWe should bring up DeMorge Brown\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:08.000\nOh,

22:56.000\nWhat if you heard Demorge?\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nThat's probably planned\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nI'd rather hear what you've heard\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nIt's only going to get better\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nIf you go like, well\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nI heard a rumor\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nGood\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nI don't know\n\n23:10.000 -->

about\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nBut then they spill their guts\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nName one gut spilled\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nYeah\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nIt's not supposed to work like that\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nI'm just saying\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nYou don't have to tell us about\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nThe\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nTell us the real thing\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nIt's very real\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nTell us the one story\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nThat made you go\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nWhat, man?\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nWhen was the last time somebody told you\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nLike a butt story\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nThat made you go\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nWhat the\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nWhat the\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nWhat are you talking about, man?\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nOr just tell any stories that made you have that reaction\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nIt doesn't have to be about my stuff\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nAny story that made you go\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nAlright, I get it\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nYou kind of minor a world star sort of thing\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nThere was this story\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\nThe thing in part was because I was 17\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nI think when I heard it\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nBut there was a friend of ours\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nWho's older brother went to college\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nAnd\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nHe came back\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nOne Thanksgiving I think\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nAnd had a story about a formal\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nHe's formal dances where\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nThe women would\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nThe guy would ask a girl or a girl would ask a guy out\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nDepending on who was the host of the party\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nAnd the idea was\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nYou would meet and have wine and cheese and crackers\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nAnd do whatever\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nAnd then all hop on a chartered coach\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nTo go to a resort somewhere for a big party\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nThat involved a dinner\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nWith several forks and knives\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nThis is a story about butt sex\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nOh, it's getting there\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nYou're doing a good job perfectly\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nThis is a classier lead up to a butt fun story\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nAnd the toast master comes down\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:08.000\nYou brought me up here\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nYou're doing everything right\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nEveryone fucked up but me\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nSo\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nThis is a story\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nAnd he's probably 19\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nTalking to 17 year olds\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nAnd he's only talking to me and my friend\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nHe kicked everybody else out of the room\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nAnd he says I don't know\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nAnd also made the guy\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nMy friend almost signed a blood contract\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nNot to tell mom and dad\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:34.000\nBut he said that\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:36.000\nHe went on a date\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nOr was asked by this girl\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nTo a formal\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nAnd he goes to the formal\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nTo the party\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nTalks about a bunch of the idiots there\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nTrying to chat him up\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nAnd see if he has the qualities\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nTo work in finance or whatever\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.000\nOlder guys\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nThey all get in a charter\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nThey go to the thing\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nThe girl's very nice\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nThe conversation is awesome\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nThat's our\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nVery tone deaf\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nFully guy\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nHe doesn't have an expansive library\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.000\nAnd he doesn't have very good timing\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nAm I still going with it?\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nWe're two realities\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nDeep where people get on a charter\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nOr is it that it doesn't\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nThe story came from\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nWhere you had to go on a plane to get to the\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nNo, not a charter plane, a charter bus\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nThese are college students\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nBut the way you met the guy\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nThat's telling the story is you were on a plane\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nNo, I'm his little brother's friend\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nAnd he comes back from Thanksgiving\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nTo tell us a story\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nAnd he's saying\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nHe's kicked everybody out of the room\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nExcept us at this party\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nAnd he's saying here's what college is like\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nThat was the funny thing about what he was saying\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nHe's telling the story and he just said\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nThat he went with this girl\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nThey had a great time at dinner\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nThey both got liquored up\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nThey both decided to leave before the charter was going back\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nGot a tax or something to take them back\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nAnd she takes them back to his room\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nAnd people do, they get down\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nSo to speak\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nAnd the guy wakes up the next day\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nAt daylight\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nJust as a crack of daylight\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nAnd realizes that he's\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nCovered in excrement\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nHis entire, like everything\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nOh boy\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nAnd he doesn't know what to do\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nSo he sort of gently\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nWakes the girl up and she says\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nOh my god, I have something to tell you\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:34.000\nBut we got to deal with this first\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nTo them, they're the only ones awake at this point\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nAnd they go through this sort of like\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nHorrific Swiss family Robinson thing\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nOf like taking each piece\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nAnd figuring out a way to get rid of it\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nThe mattress had to go out\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nWait a minute, so where did they go?\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nThey went back to her place\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nObviously, roommate\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nYes\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nWell, it's a non-linear story\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nThe protagonist also doesn't know what you don't know\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nYou're asking questions that he's going to answer\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nBut at the time I didn't\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:04.000\nRight\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nIt's a non-linear story\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nIt's not linear\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nIt was non-linear and I was confused\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nOh, I'm sorry\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nYou just interrupted\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nA non-linear story\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nHe's a fish\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nLet him fucking craft his web\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nWe know he's a fish\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nThe bottom line is this\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nThat everything was cool at the end of it\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nBut they had to\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nShe had to tell him after they got everything settled\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nThey had to clean up\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nI have so many questions\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nThey had to clean up\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nWho's poop was it?\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nWas it his or somebody else's?\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nIt was hers\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nShe has to tell him\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nThat she discovered\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nIn high school that she had a natural reaction\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nTo specifically what you were talking about\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nWhich is that\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nShe has this sort of super orgasm\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nBut then\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nHer body vents itself\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nEvacuates itself\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nMaybe she should have led with that\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nMaybe she should have said\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nHey, just so you know\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nDon't freak out\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nI didn't ask to come up here, man\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nI might shit all over you\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nThe bed, the living room\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nI might sleep in it too\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nI have to get rid of the bed\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nHe was saying the girl should have led with that\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nHe wasn't saying you should have led with that\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nI was trying to\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nHe fucked this chick\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nShe pooped her\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nShe came so hard\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nHe fucked the shit out of her\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nThey had to\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nThey immediately went to sleep\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nGood night everyone\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nYou gotta be pretty tired\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nI'll say\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nWe have to be pretty tired\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nTo go to sleep\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nBoth people\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nBoth people\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nLike she didn't go\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nOh god I just shat all over his\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nHis dick, his balls, his stomach\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nHis neck\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nAnd his\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nCheats and everything\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nBut I'm just\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nJust a little sleepy\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nI'm just gonna\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nNot off right now\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nNamaste\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nCan we at least\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nDrop $50 on an actual\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nSoundboard or something\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nLike this\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nI know\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nI'm a man of the people\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nIt's just\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nThe sounds are\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nThey raise more questions\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nThan they answer\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nSounds like your complaints are unpopular\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nIt does\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nBut please continue\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nIt's just like he does this\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nFarting one and I'm like\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nCrinkling a\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nGatorade bottle\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nLike it doesn't sound like fart\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nAnd it's like\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nSee what's this\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nIt's just a mud slide\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nThis is a train in a windstorm\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nHis soundboard is 9\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nMuffled crowds and 3 shitty farts\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nIt's just\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nIt's confusing you want sound effects\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nTo answer questions\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nAnd then every 20 presses\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nHe has to watch an ad for a\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nMatch 3 game\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nSome of those are good\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nYeah\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nWell anyways\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nMen only have prostates\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nWomen don't\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nAnd men have\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nThey have a grape in their butt\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nThat if you rub it the right way\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nThere's a whole thing\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nAnd that's it\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nI'm content leaving this topic\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nWait a minute\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nWhat's that procedure that you\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nWhen you\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nWere the Kalaniks\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nSunday's used to be\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nKalanik day for me\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nAnd I would get Kalaniks\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nTake it from there\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nAnd it was\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nAt first\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:00.000\nI was trepidatious of it\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nI was\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nKind of\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nI was worried about it\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nBecause I heard stories\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nAbout what they do there\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nBut when I got there\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\nAnd then they took care of me\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nIt was actually\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nIn hindsight it was pretty good\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nIt was alright\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nIn hindsight\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nYou felt cleaned out\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nYes, I felt great\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.000\nPeople said\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nMy eyes were brighter\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nMy\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nThe people at the facility\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nNo, no, no\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nPeople at work were going\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nYou look good, what are you doing\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nAll number two\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nExcept one time\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nShe said\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nWhatever you do\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nMaybe two days before\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nYou come in here\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nEat something\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nEat something hot\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nWhatever\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nAnd for some reason\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nI forgot I had an appointment\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nAnd I spent\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nAll day eating french fries\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nChips\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nShe said\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nEat stuff, but don't\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nWork hard\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nDon't point\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nA snowblower at the\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nShovel\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nAt the sidewalk\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nHalfway through\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nThere's a problem\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nI'm getting some blockage\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nWhich is\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nWhich is hot\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nIt's a turd\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nAnd anyway\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.000\nI'm going\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nAnd she's being very cool\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nShe's trying to make conversation\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nShe's like, just breathe\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\nYou're gonna be okay\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nSo what are you and your wife gonna do this weekend\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\nHow's your dog doing\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nShe's okay\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nAnd I'm tapping my leg\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nI don't know\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nMan\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nShe's like, just breathe\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nOkay, you're leaking a little\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nShe's telling you that\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nDo you need to\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nDo you need to go\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nDo you need to go\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nAnd I was like, see if you can breathe through it\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nDo you don't have that\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nI'm like, I can't\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nOkay, okay, okay\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nI'm gonna pull it out\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nCan I pause?\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nSure\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nA lot of people listening\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nWant to know\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nWhat position you're in\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nI'm laying on my back\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nLaying on your back\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nLaying on my back\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nAnd there's a tube coming down\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nI start on my side\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nShe puts a tube up my butt\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nAnd there's a tube coming down from an IV line\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nBut what do you call it\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nAnd there's a machine with a little window\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nYou can see all the stiff you ate\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nThroughout the week going by\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nBut when it comes out of different hose\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:10.000\nI mean\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nWhat do you mean comes out of different hose\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nYou just said you saw stuff going by\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nAnd also she's concerned about leaking\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nLike isn't the whole point to leak\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nWell, it's supposed to\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nLike shoot water up your butt\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nAnd then\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nFor a while\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nAnd then it breaks down everything\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nAnd I guess she turns it up\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nAnd it sucks it out\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nI didn't know that\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nSo\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nTo eat a bunch of french fries\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nIs to create a kind of dam\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nOf half french fry\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nHalf\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nIt's painful\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nIt's palpable that this isn't going all the way up\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nThe water is supposed to go all the way up\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nThere's supposed to be a gopher in this hole\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nYeah\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nWe've come to an impasse\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nAnd she's saying\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nTo you and she says\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nAre you going to be okay?\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nDo you want me to stop\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:06.000\nShe means do you want to go take a shit\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nOr she's saying should I run for cover\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nShould I\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nGet behind her\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nThe story's not over yet\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nSo anyway\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nAnd I'm like\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nI can't do it\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nI can't hold it in\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nI'm saying to her there's only one person in the room\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nNo but I thought inner monologue\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nInner monologue\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nInner\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nInner monologue I thought you said in her monologue\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nNo\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nLike she did stand up while I was\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nDuring her monologue you're talking\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nNo I'm sorry\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nYou're saying out loud you're going\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nI'm having a\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nI can't\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nI think I need to go\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nShe's like okay well\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nYou're really leaking\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nOkay here we go\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nWalk from the table\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nTo the toilet that's across the room\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nAnd just\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nShit all over her\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nShit on her, the floor\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nEverywhere\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nAnd then while I'm\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nShitting and she's just\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nI'm alone I said yeah I think\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nI need some time alone\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nI don't understand\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nWhy she's not more\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nWhy her industry isn't more\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nPrepared for this\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:34.000\nShe told me not to eat french fries\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nThat's too much\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nShe did her job I screwed up\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nAnd she\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:42.000\nHad a wonderful attitude about it\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:44.000\nBecause I was like\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nYou're leaking it\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nSounds like you have a dysfunction\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nNot oh you've been using\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nYour body the way a body should be used\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nYou're leaking there's a turd halfway down\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nThe water is hitting the turd\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nEarly she could just\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nCouldn't she just tie it off\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nThere's all this water that's already\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nUp in my intestine right now\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nI mean she could turn it off but there's still stuff up there\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nWhen she checked in with you and said\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nHey something's happening\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nCan we get on the same page here\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nAnd like if you had said\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\nNo it's cool\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\nShe would have been like\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nOkay I'll just increase the pressure of the hose\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nYeah I mean like what would happen\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nOn your average day\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nThere would be moments of oh boy\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nThat's a part\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nThat's a part there\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nThat's an area that's something\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\nWe have to deal with and then I'd be like\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nAnd then she would get out\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nJazz man\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nThere's a clump of grass in there\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nOkay this is going to be\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nAnd then we would go through\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nAnd it would\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nThis is the thing is like they're getting out\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nAll the gunk and crap and shit\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nAnd awful stuff and cleaning you up\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:54.000\nThat's what I'm confused by is how they regard that\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nAs force majeure when it happens\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nThis is a turd in this ass\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nThat's like the united going\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nLadies and gentlemen again we do have a full flight\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\nI don't know how it happened\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:06.000\nI know how it happened you double booked\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nYou work in the airline or\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:10.000\nAss industry\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nI'm on your side\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nMy ass is supposed to suck that out\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nCleanly and efficiently\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nWhat's supposed to suck?\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nThe tube that's in my bag\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nIs it sucking or is it shooting?\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:24.000\nIt's doing both it's shooting water up\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.000\nAnd then sucking it out\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:28.000\nShe turns up water for a while and then she goes\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nOkay I'm going to do some suction\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\nAnd you go oh what is that\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\nOnions\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:38.000\nAnd then\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:40.000\nBut then there's some times where\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\nIt's too much\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nWhere I'm like a good good good good\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nWhere it's like oh man\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\nYou know when you're trying to hold in like\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:49.000\nPoop and stuff\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nOkay so when she says it's leaking\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nShe means\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nYou're shitting all over my hands\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nShe means my arm\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:58.000\nMy blouse\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nShe means you are not being a conduit\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nYou're a broken circuit\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nShe's\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nRegretting some life choices\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nShe's saying like there's\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\nA lot because\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nI hate to acroid you\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nAbout this but the so the thing going up\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nYour ass is a two\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nIt's got two tubes\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nAn ingoing in it\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nI think it's a two way thing\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nLike an electrical cable\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:26.000\nIt's completing a circuit\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nLike the whole\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nI think I got\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nI feel right about this\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\nI'm not exactly sure\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nI'm sure there's plenty of people\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:38.000\nThat are listening to this show\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:40.000\nThat will kindly correct me\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nI don't think anybody's\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nStill listening to this show\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nNo no no\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nSo\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nWe're talking to the void right now\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nExcept for the best people in America\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nShe pulls it out\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nShe pulls it out and it's just like\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nYou know\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nPopping a water balloon and I'm just like\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:02.000\nYeah\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.000\nAnd I'm doing this\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nOh\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nShit all over my hand\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nThe floor\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nIt looks like\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:14.000\nI'm going to give you some time alone\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\nYeah I think you should\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\nShe leaves the time alone\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nAnd then she turns on\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nThe ambient music\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nA little louder\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nShe can just switch on the door\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nOh what a feeling\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nSo they will dance it on the sea\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nYeah the music goes up full\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:34.000\nAnd of course\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nI'm finishing on the toilet\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nAnd after I've washed my hands\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nThe first thing I do is\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nOf course I have to text AG\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nAnd go I just shit all over\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nThis poor woman\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nAnd he's writing back oh my god\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nWhat are you talking about\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:52.000\nI got this\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:54.000\nThis colonic\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.000\nAnd I ate poorly\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:58.000\nTwo days before\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:00.000\nAnd it gave me some issues\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nShit all over this woman\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:04.000\nI mean that's the part I'm trying to\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nIt's not that I don't have anything not figured out yet\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.000\nI'm just sort of trying to wrap my brain around\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nThe colonic industry\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:12.000\nCome inside we're going to wash the inside\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:14.000\nOf your butt out\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nWe're going to pump warm water\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nUp one side we're going to suck\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:20.000\nEverything that comes out the other side\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nNo it's the same tube\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:24.000\nShe's water up\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.000\nIt's the same tube\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:28.000\nThey're moving forward\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nShe's got a\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nShe's in charge\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nThis is starting to make sense\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nShe's like Mark Twain\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nShe's got a mechanism\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:40.000\nShe's like forward and after\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:42.000\nThere's soapy water going that way\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:44.000\nAnd then she's like okay how you feeling\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:46.000\nAnd you're like peachy and she goes cool\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nAnd then she's supposed to see\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nA certain amount of\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nComing back and then what she sees\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.000\nIs you know a half a pineapple\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nAnd she's like did you\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nHave a heavy breakfast\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:00.000\nAnd you're like no you told me not to\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:02.000\nAnd she's like suit yourself\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nThis thing's a lie detector\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\nShe shoots it up forward\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nAnd then you're like okay that's not fun\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nAnd she brings it backward and there's like a wedding ring\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nAnd a wrist watch\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nAnd she's like look you had brunch\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nSay you had brunch\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nI had brunch and she's like go to the bathroom\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nShit out your\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nShit stuff\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nBefore I clean your asshole rim\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:26.000\nOkay and she threads it out\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nAnd then diarrhea explodes everywhere\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nAll over the world\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nAnd she's like\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nAnd she goes\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nAnd she's like it's okay\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\nAnd she kills herself\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nI never see her again\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:42.000\nBut she didn't say\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nShe wasn't like it's okay it's okay it's normal\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nShe wanted to impress upon you\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nShe's been doing this for a long time\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nI'm sure I'm not the first time\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nI'm sure today was not the first time\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nIf you ate a\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nAs in the Stephen Wright bit\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nIf you ate a box of Oreos\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nBefore going to the dentist\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:02.000\nThey'd be like look\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nWhat did you do? Come on\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nYou want to meet me halfway\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:08.000\nAnd you'd be like what do you mean\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nYou ate a box of Oreos\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nI want to give my money's worth\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nYou're the expert\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nYeah they changed the tube\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nEverybody gets the same tube\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nLeavey\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nLeavey asked from the audience\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nDo they change the tube?\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\nDo they change the tube?\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nYeah even I'm\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.000\nFor those of you listening\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.000\nThat's diarrhea sound number\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.000\nRight\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nI mentioned this on the\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:40.000\nAnother\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nAnother episode\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nBut she made it a point to say\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nThere's the nozzle tip\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nThere's like an adult size\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nAnd then there's a child size\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nI like to use the adult\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nA child size\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nOn adults because it's not\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nAs evasive\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nSo it's the size of a small\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nDick\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nWhy do we think that\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nMen in America\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nAssociate\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nThe butthole and things going\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nUp it like why is that\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nA normal amount of American\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nBut like\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:18.000\nWomen too\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nIs it an American\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nButthole thing or is it a male\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.000\nAmerican\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nGay thing\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nI think it's an American male\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.000\nGay thing. I think the worst thing\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nYou could ever be in America\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nFor most Americans believe this\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:36.000\nIs to be a gay man\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nAnd we're told early on that\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nGay men use the butthole\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nThat's the joke\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nThat you're told in\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nThey don't have vaginas to\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nUse the butthole\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nThat's the beginning of being\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nOthered as a kid\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nYou're gay man\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nAnd everybody goes\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nWe're also genuinely ashamed of jerking off\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nKids that you talk to\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nThere's different mythologies\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\nAre kids still ashamed of jerking off?\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nI had to move towns\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nI had to change schools\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nThe family left town\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nBecause somebody\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nCaught him\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nAnd looked through the window of his house\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nAnd he was there masturbating\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nAnd his nickname became Jack Hammer\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nYeah, I remember you telling me about that\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\nAnd he was so ashamed and humiliated\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nHe left the goddamn town\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nAnd that's for you kids listening\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nAnd my kids I mean 30 and below\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nHere's how you fort that\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nIf you're a high school\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nMasterbader\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nIn high school you're masturbating\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nDon't let people catch you\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nBe in the bay window of your house\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nAnd you should be jerking off\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nAnd dare them to come up in your lawn\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nIt's a different steeple chase\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nBut the crazy thing is\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nThat kid, because there was no internet yet\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nThat kid could look in your drapes\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:56.000\nSee you jerking off\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nAnd then convincingly tell the locker room\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nHe was jerking off and then you'd have to change schools\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nThis isn't about changing times\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nThis is about our attitude\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nAbout sex\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nAnd self exploration\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nBecause like how bad it's always been\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nAnd hasn't really changed\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nEven though nowadays a kid could look in your drapes\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nAnd see you jerking off\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nBut the difference is\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nIf he didn't have his camera\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nIt'd be your word against his\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\nAnd it wouldn't matter\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:26.000\nIt's really about the cringe value\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nOf how you look when you jerk off now\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nBecause now the kids know everyone jerks off\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nBut how vulnerable you are\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nWhich is the same thing\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nThe things that you're talking about now\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\nWe're around at a time where now\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nThere are kids in that age group\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nWho now are adults\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:46.000\nAnd have children\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\nAnd they probably socialize them differently\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:50.000\nAnd sometimes they bet you're fucking the kid up\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nBy trying to be responsible\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nLike who wants your dad sitting on the foot of your bed\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nTalking about your dick\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:58.000\nIt could be the 40% of the time\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nWhen you think you're doing it right\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nWho's dad it is?\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nChris Pratt's dad\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nI'm just saying\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nYou don't know you could have the best of intentions\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nYou could have\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nBecause we don't have\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nWe know everything about beastings\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nThat you should know by now\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nUntil we invent a way to treat beastings better\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\nWe don't know anything about\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nKids going through puberty\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nAnd like starting to feel\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nHow they feel and blah blah blah\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nWe put it off\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\nAnd it's not even just\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nEven though we feel like in America\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\nIt's the species\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nIt's the whole fucking species\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nWe don't just go\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nBy the way, there's a thing in your butt\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nAnd there's a thing in your balls\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\nNo one wants to talk to kids about this shit\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nWhen do you talk to them?\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:48.000\nYou're seven years old\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:50.000\nBefore you care about it\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:52.000\nLet's talk about your butt and your balls\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:54.000\nAnd your dick and your nipples\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nWhat are you talking about? Spiderman\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nBut then a year later that kid could be like\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nI'm gonna go fucking insane\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:02.000\nBecause no one understands what I'm going through\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nBecause my nipples feel weird\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nFucking, what a lost species\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nDo women shame each other about masturbation?\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nIs that a girl thing?\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nChurch?\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nI've never heard a story of\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nWomen walking in on another girl\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nMasturbating in high school and that being a giant bummer\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nIs that just a guy thing?\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nYou did it together\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nYeah, they learned, I mean I hear a lot of\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nStories about girls like more\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nLike this kissing and stuff\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nBut I'm not gonna\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\nSpokesman that, but I do feel like\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nBut I've also heard stories about\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nDudes talking about jerking off\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nAnd then one kid in the group of friends\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nWill be like, yeah, jerk off, it's the best\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nAnd then that'll just be the story of how\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nThat kid changed\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nThat community\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nThey're like, oh, but you're cool\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nAnd he's like, yeah, and I fucking jerk it off all the time\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nSo do all of you, bye\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nAnd everyone's like, he's right\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nI've heard those stories, it's kind of like\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nIf word got out in\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nMy high school that\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nAnybody, any of the\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nGuys that got outed for\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nWearing women's underwear, that guy would\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nHave been run out of town\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nBut there was one guy who was a badass\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nAnd his dad was like in the mafia\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nAnd there's people like, hey man\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nApparently you wear like women's panties\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nLike silky little like\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nThong panties, he goes, yeah, they're really comfortable\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nAnd everyone's like, oh shit\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:26.000\nLike\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:28.000\nIf he backed off on that\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:30.000\nThat he would have been tortured\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nBut he goes, yeah, why don't you\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nYeah, I've heard a couple of those stories\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nThey're called taste makers\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nThey're called the\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nAnd I don't know if\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nIt's like we want to talk about\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nHow girls are different from boys\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nBut also it's like\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nIf you were high in high school, did it\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nMe and these ads, we would have been really punished\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nFor it, but you and I as adults\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\nWe like\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nTo wear the soft undies\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nYeah, we like soft undies\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nI'm hungry, I'm starving\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nI missed dinner, yeah\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nDo you wish the podcast was over so you could go eat?\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nNo, I wish I brought something to eat\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nWhat would you have brought if you had planned ahead?\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:10.000\nChiyo\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:12.000\nPsst\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nWe all know the answer to that question\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:16.000\nNow as a vegan now\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:18.000\nHow do you get your nachos?\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nYou do the vegan nachos?\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nBut I don't do\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nI do vegan cheese\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nIt's not the same\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nVegan cheese is kind of a drag\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nIt's getting better\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nEverything's getting better\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nBeyond burgers\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nAre fantastic\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nI don't melt\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nVegan cheese\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nIt just doesn't taste as good\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:46.000\nBut\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.000\nI still love it\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\nEat that shit\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nI went and had a chat with Kevin Smith\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nWho is basically vegan now\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nBecause he just had his first heart attack\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nI don't want to\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:00.000\nI'm not scheduling more heart attacks\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nDidn't he almost like\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nYeah, he almost died\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nHe had a huge total\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nWe didn't talk about that that much\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nBecause I figured he's been talking about that forever on his podcast\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nBut\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nHe's two years older than me\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nAnd he\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nSo he was never a heavy drinker\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nBut now\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nHe's like\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nHe's just gonna go vegan\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nAnd it has nothing to do with him caring about animals\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nHe's just like\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nThey told me I have to\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nIt's like all this meat and stuff\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nAnd then he's like\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:36.000\nYeah, then my friends are like\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nNow that you had a heart attack\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nYou're gonna be this kind of person\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nAnd he's like, no, I'm just\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nI ate meat for 47 years\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nIt was a good run\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nNow I'm gonna go vegan\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nBecause of this thing happening\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nOh, so you almost died\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nBecause you weren't doing something\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nSo all of a sudden you're gonna start doing it now\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nYou were thrown 80 feet from a car wreck\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nAnd you're gonna start wearing your seat belt\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nAll of a sudden\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nIt's like a really weird\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nPeople love to put people down\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\nI'm sure there's not a single person we could pull up\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\nThat they're like, yeah, that was me\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nI was Kevin Smith's friend\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nI'm sure he was just kind of collectively\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nThat would be true\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nKevin Smith still has all these friends that just bully him\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nThat would be like\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nAmazing\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nI wonder what that's like\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nThat guy's a big Rob Schwab fan\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nI'll tell you that\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nTalk to Kevin Smith about Rob Schwab\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nHe's been very nice\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nNice to me\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:36.000\nDid you talk about Robot Bastard?\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\nNo\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nI was like, can we move on?\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nAnd he was like\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:44.000\nWhat's it like working with Schwab?\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nI'm like, I don't know\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nLike, I don't know\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nDumb?\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nNo, come on, it can't be that dumb\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nI'm like, prove it\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nAnd he's like, prove what?\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nI'm like, fuck you\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nWhat do you want to do with Kevin Smith?\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nIt sounds like you could collaborate\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nHang out with him instead of Dan\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nNo\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\nThat's on the table\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nThat's so weak\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nEvery time I see Kevin\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nHe's very, very nice\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nHe's actually a big reason why\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nI did the last\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nFourishes of Skud\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nSomebody sent me, oh, Kevin's talking to you on\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nOn the forum\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nRemember forums?\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nHe's talking to you about you on the forum\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:32.000\nAnd he just wrote like\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nYou know, I love Skud\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nAnd Schwab never wants to finish the\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nBook, it's okay\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nI just, you know\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:42.000\nI just respect him, I think he's good\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nAnd whatever\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nI got the whole shebang right here\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nDid you buy that somewhere? Is this a new release, Schwab?\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.000\nIt's a\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:52.000\nNew edition of the whole shebang\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nWhich came out in 2008\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nThis is the fourth reprint of it\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:58.000\nAnd it's got a new cover\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:00.000\nIt's got the whole, it's hefty\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:02.000\nLike the OED or the like\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.000\nYeah, it's like over 800 pages\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.000\nI'm hoping I can do a Kickstarter\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:08.000\nThis year for the 25th anniversary\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:10.000\nTo maybe do, I don't know\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.000\nI'm going to regret saying this\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:14.000\nBut a color version of the whole book\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:16.000\nI think Skuds, I'm not talking\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:18.000\nShit about comic books, I just never got into them\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nBut I think Skuds are the only\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nComic books I've read like cover to cover\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:24.000\nOh, thank you\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:26.000\nBecause I know you gave them to me\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:28.000\nBut they're so well drawn\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nWell, thanks\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:32.000\nHow do you do it?\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:34.000\nI don't anymore, I don't do anything\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.000\nOne issue a month\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nLike, we would all hang out\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nAnd we'd smoke weed\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:42.000\nAnd drink and do whatever we were doing\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.000\nBut then every once in a while\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nSchwab would be like\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:48.000\nHow am I going to go work?\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:50.000\nLike, what are you working on?\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:52.000\nI'm working on a thing\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:54.000\nLike he didn't want to open it up to us\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:56.000\nAnd talk it out and invite\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nLike all of that\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nMaelstrom, so he was like\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:02.000\nFor at least a month\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nProbably several months\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nMaybe like a month and a half\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:08.000\nBut like going home and like Bob Cratchit\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.000\nLike fingerless gloves under your kitchen table\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:12.000\nYou're like drawing a page of a comic book\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:14.000\nAnd you weren't, it wasn't like running around\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:16.000\nTelling everybody, I'm going to do a comic book\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:18.000\nAnd it's going to be about this and that\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nNever said anything
