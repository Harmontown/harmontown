{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:23.200\nHello everybody, I'm Jeff Davis, I'm your Comptroller, Carmen Town, from downtown, from\n\n00:23.200 --> 00:27.760\nthese prestigious heroin and get stabbed district of Los Angeles.\n\n00:27.760 --> 00:33.200\nCarmen Town is now in session. Let's bring out our Game Master Extrusionaire, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:40.800 --> 00:46.880\nHello Spencer. What's up? What it is, man? I got the couch back. You're wearing, you got your\n\n00:46.880 --> 00:54.960\ncouch, you're wearing your iconic Lumberjackie kind of classic wardrobe. Let's bring out your mayor,\n\n00:54.960 --> 00:59.280\nhis name is Daniel Anastasia Harmon.\n\n01:05.920 --> 01:06.400\nDamn.\n\n01:08.880 --> 01:15.120\nLiving in the city isn't easy for a child.\n\n01:17.120 --> 01:22.720\nTrying to reach the sunlight even though your spirit's wild.\n\n01:22.720 --> 01:32.960\nLiving in the city should be, should be, pretty easy to reach sunlight if you're wild.\n\n01:32.960 --> 01:40.480\nOh, I didn't know I had a note session with a fellow person singing a song.\n\n01:40.480 --> 01:46.480\nLiving in the city feels trite. What does that even mean?\n\n01:46.480 --> 01:54.000\nIt feels trite. That's just a thing that high school teachers write on your essays.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:57.600\nSeven on a kitty. Damn. This feels overwrought.\n\n01:59.600 --> 02:08.960\nI'm seventeen. It's a creative writing class. I should be overwrought. I don't know how to\n\n02:09.600 --> 02:12.160\ntake that note. It sounds like over ready.\n\n02:12.160 --> 02:20.160\nHello, Dan. How's it going? Compared to these days, which I imagine you kids,\n\n02:20.160 --> 02:25.360\nyou probably didn't have a school paper. You probably have a school text, a school emoji.\n\n02:27.200 --> 02:30.720\nWhere you're like, we're going to send out the school emoji.\n\n02:32.080 --> 02:38.960\nYou fucking robots. I'm not blaming you. I feel bad for you. I didn't make my school paper,\n\n02:38.960 --> 02:43.440\nbut I had one, and we had deadlines. You didn't work on your school paper.\n\n02:43.440 --> 02:46.720\nI would assume that you would have been editor-in-chief of your school paper.\n\n02:46.720 --> 02:52.800\nLook, make no mistake. I was top shit in terms of creating the content. That's not true.\n\n02:54.640 --> 02:58.640\nNo, there were better workers, harder workers, and there were people more respected. There were\n\n02:58.640 --> 03:03.600\nbetter poets. There were better writers. But I loved working on the school paper.\n\n03:03.600 --> 03:10.320\nI just wanted glory. I had a serialized Spencer. Hell, yes. This will wake you up.\n\n03:10.320 --> 03:17.200\nSerial? I'm awake. I'm just behind everyone else. A new way of saying hi.\n\n03:21.040 --> 03:25.280\nDidn't get that big a laugh. I'm not feeling good vibes tonight.\n\n03:25.280 --> 03:33.120\nI'm not laughing at them. It seemed like I was shaming you like I'm I'm proud of you being\n\n03:33.120 --> 03:39.920\nhigh. Oh yeah, me too. No, I'm loving it. I'm just not on my game. Love how high you are.\n\n03:39.920 --> 03:46.480\nYeah, see proud of you son. Oh yeah. I was in Boston where I didn't smoke much every time I\n\n03:46.480 --> 03:51.840\ncome back from a trip. That's the highest I've ever been. It's the best. Why are you in Boston?\n\n03:51.840 --> 03:56.880\nThere's this thing called packs. I guess there's a bunch of them. There's once closer\n\n03:56.880 --> 04:04.880\napparently, but I went to the one in Boston. You play games. Oh, you were were you DMing?\n\n04:04.880 --> 04:11.840\nNo, no, I should have. If I had any forethought at all, it would have been insane. How is it\n\n04:11.840 --> 04:17.440\npacks compared to a Gen Con? I've never been to Gen Con. I want to do that too, but I don't know.\n\n04:17.440 --> 04:20.800\nIt was just weird though. I've never been to anything because it was it was kind of like\n\n04:20.800 --> 04:25.040\nComic Con just with a convention floor, you know, but then a good third of the space was just like\n\n04:25.040 --> 04:30.080\nlong tables and chairs that were just full of people playing fucking board games and games and\n\n04:30.080 --> 04:35.120\nshit. It was crazy. There's so much game playing. I've just never seen. I mean, there's all these\n\n04:35.120 --> 04:40.080\ncons we've been on. It's like check out what's on Fox and then it's like the cosplay brigade\n\n04:40.080 --> 04:44.000\nor whatever, but it's like it's all this thing. You know, it's all just kind of like this weird\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:51.200\nartifice or marketing or whatever. But like, this is just people doing doing games. It was interesting.\n\n04:51.200 --> 04:58.640\nWhen I was your age, uh, uh, Ulysses S. Grant was president of the United States.\n\n04:59.920 --> 05:05.680\nBlood was fair enough. I remember Comic Con. We would go to Comic Con and it would be like\n\n05:05.680 --> 05:10.160\nbecause we were working in comic books and it would be like, oh, we're here to sign a comic book.\n\n05:10.160 --> 05:14.480\nAnd then you'd walk around and be like, God damn, this place has a lot of people selling comic books.\n\n05:14.480 --> 05:18.560\nRight. And then there was like also people are like, well, guys are walking around selling,\n\n05:18.560 --> 05:24.080\nbuying comic books. Maybe you'd like a sword. And the answer is that's fair. Yeah. There was a\n\n05:24.080 --> 05:27.920\ndude. Lots of people want swords. There was a dude by comic books. It makes sense. In Inglewood,\n\n05:27.920 --> 05:37.680\nthat was had a sword in a Scientology church and he got killed by police because I think he\n\n05:37.680 --> 05:43.600\nfucked up a couple of cops with a sword. Oh yeah. In a Scientology church. Is that what you called\n\n05:43.600 --> 05:51.120\nthem? Uh-huh. And it's like Inglewood's fucked up for a lot of reasons, but uh, if you're gonna\n\n05:51.120 --> 05:56.000\nfucking have a sword thrown down, I like that it was a Scientology venue. Well, when you're,\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.040\nit's because, because you're able to just be objective and you don't have to root for either\n\n05:59.040 --> 06:06.320\nside. You're like, oh, I hope the police learned their lesson along with Zinu. I will, I will stab\n\n06:06.320 --> 06:11.440\nyour Satan. I don't know how it works. You just heard the word sword. And like, I mean, I'm already\n\n06:11.440 --> 06:16.000\nthree tangents deep, but I can't have you doing that. What? You're sober. I guess I can't. It's\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.360\nfine. There's no guest. There's no guest. This is it. This is the show. I brought it up. Well,\n\n06:19.360 --> 06:24.160\nwhat, it's okay. It's all right. It was a, it was a very spurious connection. I think. I was like,\n\n06:24.160 --> 06:27.520\nI was like, based on something Spencer was saying about this convention where it's like,\n\n06:27.520 --> 06:32.080\noh, it's just people play games. And I was like, I remember from the old days, the early 90s,\n\n06:32.080 --> 06:38.880\nlike 93, 95, like I remember being a comic con and like selling and buying comic books out of\n\n06:38.880 --> 06:43.440\nbig boxes and everyone was just like, it's just comic con. And yeah, there was a ton of shit that\n\n06:43.440 --> 06:48.240\nwasn't comics. I'm not, I don't, I'm not going to like be an old timer that like pretends and,\n\n06:48.240 --> 06:51.280\nyou know, there's nothing but comic books. I was like, no, it's a bunch of swords.\n\n06:53.280 --> 06:58.080\nAnd, and like, but, and then I, but I remember like when it was like that central area of the\n\n06:58.080 --> 07:04.080\nexhibit floor, like the day that it was like the PlayStation one, like, like kind of like, like,\n\n07:04.080 --> 07:09.040\noh, what's the fuck is going on in the middle of this fucking, why the hell are we having to walk\n\n07:09.040 --> 07:15.040\naround this? I was like, well, some video game decided that because technically we're all nerds\n\n07:15.680 --> 07:19.920\nthat maybe we'd be interested in Papa the Rapper, like, like, like coming out on\n\n07:19.920 --> 07:23.200\nfucking Xbox or something. And it was like, like it just started. And there was like,\n\n07:23.200 --> 07:26.720\nlike along with that, it was like everyone's wrong. What was that Bruce Willis? What the\n\n07:26.720 --> 07:31.280\nfuck's going on? Yeah. Hey, and then, and then with that comes like that. Hey, stop sitting on\n\n07:31.280 --> 07:38.880\nthe floor, fatty. Well, I got a bunch of comic books. Yeah, bet you do. You know who's got more\n\n07:38.880 --> 07:43.760\ncomic books than you, Bruce Willis. You fucking sit in the floor in front of him. I'm gonna fucking\n\n07:43.760 --> 07:49.120\nmace your ass. Now that conversation never happened. Yeah, no, those guys, the guys are bad. Those\n\n07:49.120 --> 07:53.600\nstaff guys at Comic Con are bad. At PAX, they were like volunteers and they were actually really\n\n07:53.600 --> 08:00.000\ngood at their jobs. They were like very, like, like contextual with their enforcements. But\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:07.360\njust so that both sides are represented. I'm a big both sideist. Uh-oh. We were at WonderCon.\n\n08:07.360 --> 08:12.560\nThat was a real like all the security there was volunteer, which is why a guy came up to talk\n\n08:12.560 --> 08:17.520\nabout Deadpool and his friend came up to punch him in the face. And then we were paid in an\n\n08:17.520 --> 08:22.880\nenvelope of cash and whisked back to the hotel. Those were bad. I will never go back to Florida\n\n08:22.880 --> 08:29.600\nagain. If I want to know about Florida, I will watch Flocka videos. That was a show that I was\n\n08:29.600 --> 08:35.920\nnot... You on that Flocka? Wow! Wow! I was not at that show. I wonder like how that would have\n\n08:35.920 --> 08:41.760\ngone down if I had interfered in that like interference loop. I bet you would have caught\n\n08:41.760 --> 08:47.760\nhis punch. No, I wouldn't because I'm not a martial artist. No, you wouldn't. I just think\n\n08:47.760 --> 08:50.960\nI would have made the person feel bad before they started throwing punches at people.\n\n08:50.960 --> 08:56.080\nThe guy who did not take a survey, like he... It was all very... It all happened very fast.\n\n08:56.080 --> 09:02.480\nThe guy walked up and punched his friend in the face. The thing is, it looked like he\n\n09:02.480 --> 09:08.720\nwas going to grab a mic until the very last second, which is a semi-precedent phenomenon,\n\n09:08.720 --> 09:13.760\nunfortunately. And he punched his friend. He's alleged friend. Well, we found out later that\n\n09:13.760 --> 09:19.520\nthey were friends. Was that a setup? It may have been. What's the difference when you're 22?\n\n09:19.520 --> 09:24.240\nEverything's a joke. Nothing's a joke. Like everything's... You're Tyler Durden. You're\n\n09:25.600 --> 09:28.400\nRobert Edwards or whatever the Hulk's name is. You're...\n\n09:29.920 --> 09:31.840\nBruce Bannon. It's not Robert Evans. Ed Norton.\n\n09:34.560 --> 09:40.320\nYou're Robert Evans. You're kids in the picture. You're kids out of the picture.\n\n09:41.200 --> 09:45.760\nThe kids of the Hulk. It doesn't matter to them. They're 22. What's the difference between life\n\n09:45.760 --> 09:53.280\nand death? You're 22. Here was what I did when I was 22. I spent five years doing nothing but\n\n09:53.280 --> 10:01.200\nsmoking weed out of a bong I made out of a syrup bottle. It was fucking melted plastic I was smoking.\n\n10:01.200 --> 10:07.360\nLike I wasn't even smoking weed. I tested that theory. I was like, well, maybe it's just a placebo.\n\n10:07.360 --> 10:16.400\nYeah, or you've been huffing fucking burnt plastic for five years. Like Cheryl Crowe thinks she got\n\n10:16.400 --> 10:20.640\ncancer from the water bottles in the backseat of her car. Like it's a real thing. Like the idea\n\n10:20.640 --> 10:28.240\nof just water soaking in plastic, let alone heated. This is why I can't remember Ed Norton's name.\n\n10:29.760 --> 10:34.480\nIt's not Ed Norton. That's from Honeymooners. It's Robert Evans.\n\n10:34.480 --> 10:42.720\nEd Norton is the Hulk. It's Bixby. Bixby is the Hulk. Well, come on. Bill Bixby played. Bill Bixby\n\n10:42.720 --> 10:49.600\nplayed the name of the character. Ed Norton. It's not Ed Norton. That's the actor of the\n\n10:49.600 --> 10:56.400\nnew Hulk. He played the Hulk in one of the nine Hulk movies. The angry one where the Hulk appears on\n\n10:56.400 --> 11:06.080\npage 71. Wait, what? Wait, say what? Ed Norton made the punk rock response. He was like, yeah,\n\n11:06.080 --> 11:12.080\nno, come on. I'm not making that fucking shit. The Hulk speaks to me. It's about trying to manage\n\n11:12.080 --> 11:20.080\nyour fucking anger. I'm not mocking him. It sounds a lot like I am. It was good. No, no.\n\n11:20.080 --> 11:26.880\nMark Ruffalo, right? Mark Ruffalo. He bees the Hulk. No, no, no. Who was in the angry one?\n\n11:27.920 --> 11:35.360\nEric Banna. Ang Lee, Eric Banna. Josh Whedon cracked the code. Like, don't make Hulk movies.\n\n11:35.360 --> 11:40.960\nJosh Whedon said, he's like, you can't make a Hulk movie. The Hulk is a Marvel character that\n\n11:40.960 --> 11:45.040\nhates the one thing the audience loves. Like, you can't. The Thor isn't like that. He's like,\n\n11:45.040 --> 11:50.480\ndon't get that fucking hammer away from me. Unfortunately, the Hulk is just like the closest\n\n11:50.480 --> 11:54.720\nthing you're going to get to a DC character in the Marvel universe. You can do anything but\n\n11:54.720 --> 12:00.400\ndoesn't want to. Who is the actor that played the 70s or 80s Hulk? Bill Bixby. Bill Bixby, yeah.\n\n12:00.400 --> 12:06.160\nWell, Lufrigna was the Hulk, but who? Bill Bixby was the non-Hulky version of that character.\n\n12:06.160 --> 12:11.920\nFantastic. I wish, I really wish Bill Bixby, well, I mean, if he was, Bill Bixby is fucking great.\n\n12:11.920 --> 12:16.000\nWatch my favorite Martian, the young Bill Bixby. He'd Hulk out and his pants would fly off,\n\n12:16.800 --> 12:21.840\nand then all of a sudden he had a rope belt. Where did that rope come from? He had an endless\n\n12:21.840 --> 12:25.520\nsupply of rope, but not an endless supply. It came from a satisfied audience in the Academy of\n\n12:25.520 --> 12:32.960\nTelevision Sciences because that show won an Emmy for Best Dramatic Series on television. The Hulk,\n\n12:32.960 --> 12:36.800\nwhere they would regularly, if they had to show a close-up of the Hulk's foot,\n\n12:36.800 --> 12:43.680\nmashing a gas pedal, as it sometimes did, because sometimes the Hulk did need to angrily drive a\n\n12:43.680 --> 12:49.200\ncar. And they would show a close-up of his foot, and it would be Lufrigna's foot with a little\n\n12:49.200 --> 12:54.880\ngreen pantyhose on it, like a little, like a spandex. But also the pants were torn in a way\n\n12:54.880 --> 13:01.040\nthat like a pirate's pants are torn. They weren't torn in regular, like, I, oh, my leg got three\n\n13:01.040 --> 13:04.240\ntimes bigger. They were torn in a weird department kind of way. But it was amazing, like they would\n\n13:04.240 --> 13:09.760\nshow, I was watching a Hulk rerun and they showed like the Hulk went, and like jammed his foot.\n\n13:09.760 --> 13:12.480\nAnd you could tell, it's like, okay, so what are we going to cut to in the edit bay? And the answer\n\n13:12.480 --> 13:16.480\nis usually like a second unit. Like if you, you can bank this stuff, like they're like, well,\n\n13:16.480 --> 13:21.520\nyeah, we sent out the crew and we shot like one of the stunt guys or whatever, like we shot their\n\n13:21.520 --> 13:25.280\nfoot going through the thing. And it was like the guys, like whoever it is, they're wearing like,\n\n13:25.280 --> 13:28.720\nthey're wearing a thing that would make sense for them to wear instead of spray painting their feet\n\n13:28.720 --> 13:32.000\ngreen if they're doing like shots of them, like leaping over fences or whatever. But this, which\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:36.560\nis like they're wearing like a green sock on their foot. And it doesn't, it's not like, I mean in\n\n13:36.560 --> 13:40.400\nthis world of CG, you don't even probably don't even understand what I'm really saying. Like it's\n\n13:40.400 --> 13:47.360\njust like green tights like on your foot, like, so there's no toes. And they do like a close-up of\n\n13:47.360 --> 13:52.160\nbig, and it's like, editor was like, yeah, I'll use it. And the executive producer was like,\n\n13:52.160 --> 13:55.680\nwhat are you doing a sock commercial? And he's like, no, this is your show about the Hulk.\n\n13:55.680 --> 14:02.880\nAnd the EP was like, okay, well, what's it, what do we do after this? It goes into the Smithsonian.\n\n14:02.880 --> 14:08.480\nNo, it goes on television for an hour. And like, oh, are you sure people aren't gonna, dude,\n\n14:08.480 --> 14:13.840\nthere's no, what do you think people are gonna record it? People are gonna watch it over and\n\n14:13.840 --> 14:19.280\nover again. 75% of the human beings that love your show and gave you an Emmy are never gonna\n\n14:19.280 --> 14:24.960\nsee that foot. They're gonna be making a sandwich. They're gonna be yelling at their daughter for\n\n14:24.960 --> 14:33.360\njoining the occult. The MRA. And like, none of them knew, the VCR hadn't been invented. So like,\n\n14:33.360 --> 14:38.480\nback then, it was just going out of the airwaves, which means it's like going, like, it's like\n\n14:38.480 --> 14:48.800\npissing it out of your dick. But also, watching old TV on high-def television, like a great digital\n\n14:48.800 --> 14:54.320\nTV, changes everything. When it's remastered, like if they would shoot Night Rider on film,\n\n14:54.320 --> 14:58.800\nand then they would, and then it got broadcast, you know, that some of these old shows, like they\n\n14:58.800 --> 15:03.760\nshoot it on film and then, and then if they kept the shit or whatever, it's like they'll do like\n\n15:03.760 --> 15:08.080\nNight Rider on Blu-ray. You can like watch the thing and you're like, oh, now you're seeing\n\n15:08.080 --> 15:12.480\nshit that not only, but I'm just saying even, even before high-def where you're like, oh,\n\n15:12.480 --> 15:16.480\nthey didn't know Wonder Woman's like wig would look like, you know, they didn't know we could see\n\n15:16.480 --> 15:21.440\nthat makeup because they didn't have high-def. But I'm saying even like the, they also didn't\n\n15:21.440 --> 15:28.000\nunderstand the high-def that is we would all have all media permanently stored forever.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:33.200\nForever, yeah. It wasn't momentary. They were just like, well, what we do is we like throw\n\n15:33.200 --> 15:38.880\nthese candies at a parade. And I'm not imputing them at all. They took great pride in it, but they\n\n15:38.880 --> 15:43.760\nthought that their job was like, they've spent more time going like, when you throw candy,\n\n15:43.760 --> 15:48.400\ndon't hit a kid in the eye. Don't let them choke, you know, like don't throw it to a kid who looks\n\n15:48.400 --> 15:52.880\nlike his epiglottis might be malformed. Like they, they were focused more on different shit\n\n15:52.880 --> 15:56.560\nbecause it was of the moment. And now we live in this world where it's like every candy is like\n\n15:56.560 --> 16:01.200\nbeamed into their brain by Venmo and they have it forever. So keep in mind that five years from now\n\n16:01.200 --> 16:07.840\nyou might be committing a felony. Do you remember when the Harlem Globetrotters made it to Gilligan's\n\n16:07.840 --> 16:18.240\nIsland? Yeah, but they finally made it. But also, also fucking, also they got off the island. Like in\n\n16:18.240 --> 16:25.120\nthe same episode. Everybody does. How come the cast can't be smarter than the Harlem Globetrotters\n\n16:25.120 --> 16:32.080\nand make a boat? These are, these are old questions, Jeff. Everybody wonders that. Let's do a segment\n\n16:32.080 --> 16:38.640\ncalled old TV questions. Oh yeah. Who's got an old TV question for me? Don't ask them.\n\n16:39.600 --> 16:46.720\nI have 800,000 questions about Fantasy Island. Yeah. Chris McKenna and I are obsessed. Like\n\n16:46.720 --> 16:50.720\nwithout having even really rewatched the show, Chris McKenna and I are from community are\n\n16:50.720 --> 16:56.080\nconstantly talking about like doing our Fantasy Island reboot where, where you focus more on the\n\n16:56.080 --> 16:59.840\npeople that work at Fantasy Island because it's like, what the fuck for those of you who don't\n\n16:59.840 --> 17:03.360\nknow, you probably have heard the log. Like you're probably as familiar with it as I am,\n\n17:03.360 --> 17:06.400\neven though I grew up like with it actually on the air, but you probably because it's such a\n\n17:06.400 --> 17:13.680\nsimple concept. It's Mr. Rourke, Ricardo Montalban, Montalban and his diminutive magical friend,\n\n17:14.480 --> 17:20.400\nHerve Villaches playing a guy named Tattoo. They both wear white suits and they work on this island\n\n17:20.400 --> 17:25.600\nand a plane comes down plane lands with three people or couples. And as they get off the plane,\n\n17:25.600 --> 17:34.080\nMr. Tattoo goes, who's that boss? What about them? Ah, Tattoo. That is a famous author, J.K. Rowling.\n\n17:35.520 --> 17:39.680\nSometimes it would be ripped from the headlines in that like subtle 70s way. Like that's a famous\n\n17:39.680 --> 17:46.720\nauthor, R.K. Fowling. You know, like, oh, I get it. Like the archetype of the famous author. And\n\n17:46.720 --> 17:53.600\nit's like, she's, oh God, she sold over 300,000 books. That's half the population of the earth.\n\n17:53.600 --> 18:03.040\nThat's correct, Tattoo. But she's never experienced the gas shortage. No, I'm just trying to say it's\n\n18:03.040 --> 18:10.640\nlike a 70s show. I don't know. Dan Harmon answers his own TV question. But like a massive bulk\n\n18:10.640 --> 18:20.240\nof the people that came to Fantasy Island, a huge percentage of the people that came to Fantasy\n\n18:20.240 --> 18:26.640\nIsland were getting, you know, they all paid ostensibly, I would say, an exorbitant price.\n\n18:26.640 --> 18:31.040\nOtherwise, why isn't there a ship full of people? It's always a sea plane and people are getting\n\n18:31.040 --> 18:37.760\noff and they look rich and they're like always bestselling authors. And so they paid a hefty sum\n\n18:37.760 --> 18:44.960\nand then like a lot of them were like, like came there going, I want to be famous or I want to be\n\n18:44.960 --> 18:51.040\na rock star or I want to be rich. I want to be respected. And like a bunch of them, if not all\n\n18:51.040 --> 18:57.840\nof them, like it was like, oh, okay, I guess that's kind of fucked up that you made me get chased by\n\n18:57.840 --> 19:11.120\na dinosaur. But now that I think of it, I just needed confidence. Bye. Thank you. Fantasy fulfilled\n\n19:11.120 --> 19:18.160\njust not the one I paid for the one I needed. Can I have my money back? My memory is that they\n\n19:18.160 --> 19:22.720\nwere always like, they accidentally found out they needed to fall in love with Orson Welles or\n\n19:22.720 --> 19:28.320\nsomebody like they had to. I mean, all I remember as a kid is it was always like the only theme I\n\n19:28.320 --> 19:33.360\nremember concept was just sort of like, but I'm unhappy now. Yes, but that's the point. Oh, thank\n\n19:33.360 --> 19:42.080\nyou. I could I could have sworn I could have gone to McDonald's with a thousand times less money\n\n19:42.080 --> 19:48.400\nthan I gave you and gotten more opportunity to inspect myself. But would you have hung out with\n\n19:48.400 --> 19:55.680\nStephanie? What's her name? Zimbalist? The cast of that show is always great. Well,\n\n19:56.560 --> 20:00.240\nbut that's the only other thing about Fantasy Island is like the fascinating thing is that\n\n20:00.240 --> 20:03.600\neven though there's three couples that show up at the beginning of the episode,\n\n20:05.120 --> 20:08.960\nthere's like there's always these establishing shots of like, oh, and then fantasy island\n\n20:08.960 --> 20:14.080\nbusiness is going on. And there's like, you see like people, there's like waiters bringing\n\n20:14.800 --> 20:19.680\ncoconut drinks to like people that are sitting by the side of the pool. And none of those people\n\n20:19.680 --> 20:26.560\ncame in on a sea plane. I think they all did. I think they're all on a fantasy island. You think\n\n20:26.560 --> 20:32.640\nevery time I mean that's like a rotation of sea planes. The camera focuses on Stephanie powers\n\n20:32.640 --> 20:40.000\nand like Robert something. I was assuming more that like you could also come to fantasy island\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:46.240\non a huge shitty ferry from New Jersey or something and like pay $80 a weekend to like\n\n20:46.240 --> 20:50.160\nsit near rich people who were being taught that they shouldn't need shit as much.\n\n20:50.160 --> 20:56.960\nLike you're just like, give me another drink. Stop yelling. Hey, well, listen, Mr. Rourke\n\n20:56.960 --> 21:02.560\nain't going to teach you to fucking quit lipping off. So because we didn't pay for the platinum\n\n21:02.560 --> 21:08.480\npackage to just fucking do what I say and give me a napkin. I can't wait till we're rich enough\n\n21:08.480 --> 21:13.840\nto come to this island and and tattoo says who's that and Mr. Rourke says it's a guy who wishes\n\n21:13.840 --> 21:19.520\nhis wife would shut up so that you get chased by a dinosaur. Yeah, well, I'm looking around and I\n\n21:19.520 --> 21:31.920\nain't see a new dinosaurs. So shut your lip, Rebecca. Oh, it's a living. I was just in Atlantic\n\n21:31.920 --> 21:38.160\nCity and you did a perfect impression of everybody every conversation. You just walk down the\n\n21:38.160 --> 21:43.120\nstreet and you see, oh, this looks like a lovely couple. And I was like, Oh, who's going to fuck\n\n21:43.120 --> 21:50.240\nme tonight? You fucking jamook. You fucking piece of shit. Stugatz. And there's the guy\n\n21:50.960 --> 21:55.920\ntalking to the girl and the girl goes, Oh, who the fuck are you? You fucking and then they go,\n\n21:55.920 --> 22:02.240\nOh, Jeff Davis, we love your show coming tonight. That's terrific. And then they come up on stage.\n\n22:02.240 --> 22:07.920\nThe audience was drunker than the cast, which we find highly disrespectful.\n\n22:07.920 --> 22:15.280\nHoly fuck, Jersey audiences. I had it off to you because wow.\n\n22:18.560 --> 22:23.360\nThe women smoke and talk like stevedores. It's really, it's amazing. I mean, that's hot.\n\n22:26.400 --> 22:31.200\nBut that might be part of the Marissa Tomei, my cousin Vinnie Trope of like, like, I don't know,\n\n22:31.200 --> 22:36.080\nbut I think I mean, I like, I like a dirty girl. I told you the story. Have I told the story?\n\n22:36.080 --> 22:40.160\nI don't like Princess Leia. I don't want to soil Princess Leia. I know I did my little disgusting\n\n22:40.160 --> 22:44.880\nmisogynistic rant about Amy Grant, but that was my old 15 year old self. I was like, Oh, I want to,\n\n22:46.240 --> 22:52.960\nI have grown into a man that wants to be soiled. And I have found a partner that I feel, I always\n\n22:52.960 --> 22:59.120\nfeel dirtier after I have sex with Cody. And that's why I am proud to give her my fucking.\n\n22:59.120 --> 23:04.560\nI'm never going to get an erection again after that.\n\n23:05.840 --> 23:09.520\nI have told the story about what the girl said that was trying to come on to Ryan in\n\n23:10.880 --> 23:13.760\nMorristown, New Jersey, right? I've told the story before, haven't I?\n\n23:13.760 --> 23:17.600\nI don't know. Audience have. Go for it. Just let her rip.\n\n23:17.600 --> 23:21.760\nAll right. So we're at, we did a show in Morristown, New Jersey. It's very nice.\n\n23:21.760 --> 23:28.720\nAnd it's like the Mayo something. It's a fancy theater and across the street is a nice pub.\n\n23:29.600 --> 23:34.160\nWe meet some... The Mayo theater sounds incredible. One of those fancy places, like the Mayo theater.\n\n23:34.160 --> 23:38.800\nNo, like the Mayo Center. Like it's like an aristocratic kind of, you know,\n\n23:38.800 --> 23:42.320\nhealthy occupational... A healthy... Asker Meyer auditorium.\n\n23:42.320 --> 23:48.960\nYes. It was a miracle. And we are at this pub across the street and Ryan and I and Greg\n\n23:48.960 --> 23:54.160\nProops and I think Chip Eston, we meet a gang of waitresses and they all say,\n\n23:54.160 --> 23:56.720\nhey, you guys got to come to this bar after we're done.\n\n23:56.720 --> 24:00.720\nYou got to come to this fucking bar. No, no, no. They're currently working.\n\n24:00.720 --> 24:03.520\nThey're wearing their working tops. So they can't cuss.\n\n24:03.520 --> 24:06.640\nThey can't cuss. They're being very... Well, I think that's how people in Jersey dress.\n\n24:06.640 --> 24:08.640\nHuh? Well, go ahead. Get started.\n\n24:09.840 --> 24:14.080\nThese are women that are wearing a bow tie and an apron and a thing at a club.\n\n24:14.080 --> 24:19.040\nWe go to a club and it is... I will never forget that when we walked in,\n\n24:19.040 --> 24:22.080\nIce Ice Baby was playing and people were line dancing to it.\n\n24:25.600 --> 24:28.560\nThey were doing the electric slide to Ice Ice Baby.\n\n24:28.560 --> 24:32.480\nThey're like, oh shit, it's fucking 1991 right now. It's great.\n\n24:32.480 --> 24:39.520\nAnd there was a giant transgender woman, I'll say, who looked like Mean Joe Green\n\n24:39.520 --> 24:45.440\nwearing a blue cocktail dress who like immediately fell in love with Ryan Stiles\n\n24:45.440 --> 24:48.080\nbecause he knew who he was. You're selling this place.\n\n24:49.440 --> 24:52.960\nIf you go to Maristown, find this fucking place because it's great.\n\n24:52.960 --> 24:58.240\nLike it's just drywall. There's no... There's nothing. It's just a fucking nightmare.\n\n24:58.240 --> 25:04.640\nAnd we want to hide right now. Are we safe?\n\n25:04.640 --> 25:07.040\nRyan Stiles is six foot six, I think.\n\n25:07.040 --> 25:10.320\nThis guy is a head taller than him.\n\n25:10.320 --> 25:11.440\nThe cocktail fella?\n\n25:11.440 --> 25:14.960\nHe's just a person that's at the bar.\n\n25:14.960 --> 25:16.240\nOh, okay. Different fella.\n\n25:16.240 --> 25:21.680\nAnd Ryan introduced me to him or her and said, hey, Jeff, have you met the little lady?\n\n25:21.680 --> 25:26.000\nHave you met the little lady? He died laughing. We all had a good time.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:31.040\nAnd then we all went to another bar and then three girls followed us.\n\n25:31.040 --> 25:35.680\nOne girl who was also like flat footed my height.\n\n25:35.680 --> 25:41.120\nI'm 6'4\". She in the middle of the street just started making out with me.\n\n25:41.120 --> 25:42.080\nHe's 6'2\".\n\n25:42.080 --> 25:43.040\nThis was unheralded.\n\n25:43.040 --> 25:44.640\nHe's 6'4 on his toes.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:47.840\nAnd I go, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n25:47.840 --> 25:51.680\nAnd the other girl comes up to me that was coming on to Ryan,\n\n25:51.680 --> 25:54.240\nwho is like the best looking of the trio.\n\n25:54.240 --> 25:59.760\nAnd she goes, Jeff, she goes, I want to make out with Ryan tonight.\n\n25:59.760 --> 26:04.080\nI go, you just told me that that guy right behind us is your fiance.\n\n26:04.080 --> 26:06.080\nYou know that Ryan is married.\n\n26:06.080 --> 26:10.080\nAnd she goes, oh, you got to be single to fuck with you guys.\n\n26:14.080 --> 26:18.080\nAll right. You found my, I don't want to go there anymore.\n\n26:18.080 --> 26:20.080\nI don't like, I don't like...\n\n26:20.080 --> 26:22.080\nNew Jersey is fucking insane.\n\n26:22.080 --> 26:24.080\nIt's a crazy place made of crazy people.\n\n26:24.080 --> 26:30.080\nWhen I got to Boston, like within like two hours of being there,\n\n26:30.080 --> 26:32.080\nI got to my hotel and then I left my hotel to get dinner\n\n26:32.080 --> 26:34.080\nand just walking to a restaurant.\n\n26:34.080 --> 26:40.080\nI heard two separate people just like call other people the F word for a gaisler.\n\n26:40.080 --> 26:44.080\nAnd I was like, wow, this is just, yeah, this is Boston. Okay.\n\n26:44.080 --> 26:46.080\nLike the two syllable version?\n\n26:46.080 --> 26:50.080\nYeah, yeah. It was, I was like, wow, this is, it was great.\n\n26:50.080 --> 26:54.080\nI mean, not great, you know, it was Boston as fuck.\n\n26:54.080 --> 26:56.080\nBoston.\n\n26:56.080 --> 26:58.080\nSimpler times.\n\n26:58.080 --> 27:00.080\nI was, I was in...\n\n27:00.080 --> 27:02.080\nI was in Vegas yesterday.\n\n27:02.080 --> 27:04.080\nI was in Las Vegas.\n\n27:04.080 --> 27:06.080\nDid someone say Thursday?\n\n27:06.080 --> 27:08.080\nYeah, that's what happened.\n\n27:08.080 --> 27:10.080\nYou said it. Simpler times Thursday.\n\n27:10.080 --> 27:12.080\nYeah, in Boston.\n\n27:12.080 --> 27:16.080\nI was walking behind two cats at a place in Vegas yesterday\n\n27:16.080 --> 27:20.080\nand the guy goes, I'm pretty sure Philadelphia accent.\n\n27:20.080 --> 27:24.080\nI can't do a great Philadelphia accent, but I guarantee.\n\n27:24.080 --> 27:26.080\nWhich borough?\n\n27:26.080 --> 27:28.080\nYou heard me. Which side of the 10105?\n\n27:28.080 --> 27:30.080\nYeah, it's by the fucking thing.\n\n27:30.080 --> 27:32.080\nWhat the fuck are you want to talk about?\n\n27:32.080 --> 27:34.080\nWho am I? The fucking guy?\n\n27:34.080 --> 27:36.080\nLike a West, a West Lisbon.\n\n27:36.080 --> 27:38.080\nIt's by Permanis and you got to get it off your chest.\n\n27:38.080 --> 27:40.080\nIt's by Permanis.\n\n27:40.080 --> 27:44.080\nBut a guy in front of me wearing a tank top\n\n27:44.080 --> 27:48.080\non a Saturday afternoon, as you do in Vegas,\n\n27:48.080 --> 27:52.080\nif you are determined to never get late.\n\n27:52.080 --> 27:54.080\nSandals and tank tops.\n\n27:54.080 --> 27:58.080\nOne guy in a tank top with a backwards baseball cap\n\n27:58.080 --> 28:00.080\nsays to the other guy in a tank top\n\n28:00.080 --> 28:02.080\nwhat I think with a forward baseball cap.\n\n28:02.080 --> 28:06.080\nHe goes, you fucking motherfucker.\n\n28:06.080 --> 28:08.080\nI was up 12 grand.\n\n28:08.080 --> 28:12.080\nI'm down 12 grand now, you fucking motherfucker.\n\n28:12.080 --> 28:14.080\nI'm fucking down 12 grand.\n\n28:14.080 --> 28:18.080\nBut you should have fucking walked away.\n\n28:18.080 --> 28:22.080\nThere's children walking by them.\n\n28:22.080 --> 28:26.080\nThe beauty of Vegas is that nobody has any fucking heldry\n\n28:26.080 --> 28:28.080\nand fucking bull.\n\n28:28.080 --> 28:30.080\nWell, that's how those guys learned.\n\n28:30.080 --> 28:32.080\nBut also, I like the fact that that guy had 12 grand\n\n28:32.080 --> 28:34.080\nto throw around.\n\n28:34.080 --> 28:36.080\nIt's not like if you keep those kids out of that place\n\n28:36.080 --> 28:38.080\nthey all turn into neurophysicists.\n\n28:38.080 --> 28:42.080\nThey basically end up 85% of them back there going\n\n28:42.080 --> 28:44.080\nhey, oh, wait.\n\n28:44.080 --> 28:48.080\nI hate all of you.\n\n28:48.080 --> 28:51.080\nIf you're down 12 grand and you're wearing a tank top,\n\n28:51.080 --> 28:54.080\nthat's your fault.\n\n28:54.080 --> 28:56.080\nYeah, because it's a choice you make.\n\n28:56.080 --> 28:58.080\nI'm saying I'm adding the added cynicism\n\n28:58.080 --> 29:00.080\nthat you can't save those kids.\n\n29:00.080 --> 29:03.080\nMost of them turn out to be fucking idiots.\n\n29:03.080 --> 29:07.080\nYou could raise them in a fucking under a rockin' at NASA.\n\n29:07.080 --> 29:09.080\nI guess that's dangerous.\n\n29:09.080 --> 29:12.080\nWhere's the smartest place you could raise a kid?\n\n29:12.080 --> 29:14.080\nWhere's a kid surrounded?\n\n29:14.080 --> 29:17.080\nUnder underneath a giant rocket.\n\n29:17.080 --> 29:19.080\nI already said that's not a good place.\n\n29:19.080 --> 29:21.080\nDummy.\n\n29:21.080 --> 29:26.080\nYou fucking Stugots.\n\n29:26.080 --> 29:31.080\nAnyways, what I was going to say to you was\n\n29:31.080 --> 29:34.080\nthat, god damn it, now I lost it again.\n\n29:34.080 --> 29:35.080\nOh, no.\n\n29:35.080 --> 29:37.080\nIt was, wait, shit, shit, shit, shit, fuck, fuck, fuck.\n\n29:37.080 --> 29:38.080\nWe're almost there.\n\n29:38.080 --> 29:39.080\nGod damn it, god damn it.\n\n29:39.080 --> 29:40.080\nIt's coming around.\n\n29:40.080 --> 29:41.080\nYou're going to get it.\n\n29:41.080 --> 29:42.080\nThis is about Boston.\n\n29:42.080 --> 29:43.080\nYou're going to get it.\n\n29:43.080 --> 29:44.080\nIt wasn't Boston.\n\n29:44.080 --> 29:45.080\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n29:45.080 --> 29:46.080\nWay, way back.\n\n29:46.080 --> 29:48.080\nWay back.\n\n29:48.080 --> 29:50.080\nMemory.\n\n29:50.080 --> 29:52.080\nMaybe a beat will bring it around for you.\n\n29:52.080 --> 29:53.080\nTalk it.\n\n29:53.080 --> 29:56.080\nTry to think about the thoughts in your head.\n\n29:56.080 --> 29:59.080\nTry to visualize a warehouse instead.\n\n29:59.080 --> 30:03.080\nLike the Dreamcatcher movie when they went through the halls\n\n30:03.080 --> 30:10.080\nso that you could understand it all about the concept of memory.\n\n30:10.080 --> 30:13.080\nSo you guys see Dreamcatcher?\n\n30:13.080 --> 30:14.080\nAll right, stop.\n\n30:14.080 --> 30:17.080\nI just got bummed out.\n\n30:17.080 --> 30:22.080\nA character in the movie Dreamcatcher, Stephen King's Dreamcatcher,\n\n30:22.080 --> 30:25.080\nand they're like, oh, man.\n\n30:25.080 --> 30:28.080\nIt's a nine-hour mini-series event.\n\n30:28.080 --> 30:33.080\nThey couldn't figure out what to remove from this tome.\n\n30:33.080 --> 30:34.080\nIt's just adapted.\n\n30:34.080 --> 30:36.080\nPeople need to see it.\n\n30:36.080 --> 30:38.080\nIt's words coming out of a typewriter.\n\n30:38.080 --> 30:39.080\nWhat do we do?\n\n30:39.080 --> 30:40.080\nWe got to commit it to film.\n\n30:40.080 --> 30:43.080\nIf the book says they did this, they got to do that.\n\n30:43.080 --> 30:46.080\nIf the book was 300 pages, then the script's going to be 900 pages.\n\n30:46.080 --> 30:49.080\nIf that means that the thing's going to be 10 hours long,\n\n30:49.080 --> 30:50.080\nthen we can't put it in a theater.\n\n30:50.080 --> 30:53.080\nNo theater will fit.\n\n30:53.080 --> 30:54.080\nRelease it on television.\n\n30:54.080 --> 30:57.080\nThere, I said it.\n\n30:57.080 --> 31:05.080\nOK, so Dreamcatcher is like a 900-page script for a 10-hour event\n\n31:05.080 --> 31:11.080\nabout a group of grown-ups who get this in their childhood\n\n31:11.080 --> 31:16.080\nused to experience magical things that were scary,\n\n31:16.080 --> 31:20.080\nthat taught them that they were special in amorphous ways.\n\n31:20.080 --> 31:24.080\nSo then in adulthood, they get together and the ay-ya-yi-ya-yi\n\n31:24.080 --> 31:29.080\nfind your backspace key.\n\n31:29.080 --> 31:32.080\nThere, I said it.\n\n31:32.080 --> 31:36.080\nI got drunk enough.\n\n31:36.080 --> 31:38.080\nI wouldn't do anything.\n\n31:38.080 --> 31:39.080\nYou know why?\n\n31:39.080 --> 31:44.080\nI have enough integrity that I don't ever write anything.\n\n31:44.080 --> 31:48.080\nMy fingers tremble with the responsibility above the keys\n\n31:48.080 --> 31:51.080\nbecause I'm no hack.\n\n31:51.080 --> 31:56.080\nI would never finish Monster House.\n\n31:56.080 --> 31:59.080\nI would have spent another 20 years.\n\n31:59.080 --> 32:04.080\nYou would never know how that house would stop being a monster.\n\n32:04.080 --> 32:06.080\nI never would have told you how it started.\n\n32:06.080 --> 32:08.080\nWhy did the house become a monster?\n\n32:08.080 --> 32:12.080\nThe lady at a circus didn't get loved enough.\n\n32:12.080 --> 32:15.080\nThey finished that for me.\n\n32:15.080 --> 32:21.080\nAs far as I understood it,\n\n32:21.080 --> 32:23.080\nthe point of the movie was supposed to be,\n\n32:23.080 --> 32:25.080\ndon't ask those questions.\n\n32:25.080 --> 32:27.080\nThey go to the library and they pull out a book\n\n32:27.080 --> 32:29.080\nand it's supposed to be like,\n\n32:29.080 --> 32:31.080\nSchrabs pitched it and I was like, that's great.\n\n32:31.080 --> 32:33.080\nLet's just do it this way.\n\n32:33.080 --> 32:35.080\nThey go to the library and they pull out a book\n\n32:35.080 --> 32:38.080\nand there's a page and it's like Abe Lincoln's fighting a monster log cabin\n\n32:38.080 --> 32:40.080\nwith a coal shovel.\n\n32:40.080 --> 32:43.080\nThey're like, this has been happening since the beginning of time.\n\n32:43.080 --> 32:45.080\nThere's a word for this kind of demon.\n\n32:45.080 --> 32:47.080\nIt's like a property demon.\n\n32:47.080 --> 32:51.080\nIf you die coveting your property a certain amount,\n\n32:51.080 --> 32:54.080\nthere's like a monster pyramid biting in Egyptian.\n\n32:54.080 --> 32:56.080\nIt's like, if you...\n\n32:56.080 --> 33:00.080\nFuck it, make monster pyramid.\n\n33:00.080 --> 33:02.080\nThat's a fucking, that's your movie.\n\n33:02.080 --> 33:06.080\nWhat if they had let me finish that beautiful script?\n\n33:06.080 --> 33:09.080\nI would be on my third draft by now,\n\n33:09.080 --> 33:12.080\nbut no, they dragged it out of me.\n\n33:12.080 --> 33:15.080\nMonster pyramid, I want to fucking see that immediately.\n\n33:15.080 --> 33:20.080\nBut you're not supposed to then go find out that,\n\n33:20.080 --> 33:23.080\noh, on top of that there's another reason why the house is a monster\n\n33:23.080 --> 33:26.080\nand it's not what you thought, it's because of body shaming.\n\n33:26.080 --> 33:28.080\nI'm fine with that too,\n\n33:28.080 --> 33:31.080\nbut it's like I would have removed the time life book\n\n33:31.080 --> 33:33.080\nand I would have like, you know,\n\n33:33.080 --> 33:36.080\nbut you know, I would have not written it is my point.\n\n33:36.080 --> 33:38.080\nHere I am, 46 years old,\n\n33:38.080 --> 33:41.080\nlike what am I trying to convince you kids of?\n\n33:41.080 --> 33:46.080\nThe mythology of the auteur, it's garbage.\n\n33:46.080 --> 33:48.080\nLike what am I? I'm a piece of shit.\n\n33:48.080 --> 33:52.080\nI'm a terrible, like I'm a scarecrow, a living scarecrow.\n\n33:52.080 --> 33:55.080\nI should be a cautionary tale to you.\n\n33:55.080 --> 33:59.080\nDon't let the crows of your ambition land in my corn.\n\n33:59.080 --> 34:08.080\nYou should see me crucified by my own self-imposed paralysis.\n\n34:08.080 --> 34:11.080\nThat was a lot of redundancy and I would have refined that,\n\n34:11.080 --> 34:13.080\nbut I don't have a backspace key in the podcast.\n\n34:13.080 --> 34:15.080\nIt's like I wouldn't have written this scene.\n\n34:15.080 --> 34:16.080\nHit the backspace.\n\n34:16.080 --> 34:18.080\nOkay, let's move on to something else.\n\n34:18.080 --> 34:20.080\nSo it was the fucking...\n\n34:20.080 --> 34:21.080\nYeah.\n\n34:21.080 --> 34:22.080\nGod damn it.\n\n34:22.080 --> 34:23.080\nThank you.\n\n34:23.080 --> 34:26.080\nI was talking about, what did I talk about when I first came out?\n\n34:26.080 --> 34:30.080\nNo, that was me. What did you talk about?\n\n34:30.080 --> 34:31.080\nGo back.\n\n34:31.080 --> 34:32.080\nRight.\n\n34:32.080 --> 34:34.080\nBecause you would just say, Fort?\n\n34:34.080 --> 34:35.080\nSchool papers.\n\n34:35.080 --> 34:36.080\nSchool papers. Ah, yes.\n\n34:36.080 --> 34:37.080\nYes.\n\n34:37.080 --> 34:38.080\nThanks.\n\n34:38.080 --> 34:39.080\nGood job, guys.\n\n34:39.080 --> 34:40.080\nThank you.\n\n34:40.080 --> 34:41.080\nWe did it.\n\n34:41.080 --> 34:42.080\nWe worked as a team.\n\n34:42.080 --> 34:44.080\nTeamwork makes the dream work.\n\n34:44.080 --> 34:47.080\nThis podcast is going to be all right.\n\n34:47.080 --> 34:52.080\nI just wanted to let you know that on my school paper,\n\n34:52.080 --> 34:59.080\nI wrote, I tried to write a serialized medieval fantasy piece.\n\n34:59.080 --> 35:00.080\nYeah, that's awesome.\n\n35:00.080 --> 35:02.080\nThat was going to be this epic thing.\n\n35:02.080 --> 35:05.080\nIt was called The Legend of Falstaff or something.\n\n35:05.080 --> 35:06.080\nUh-huh.\n\n35:06.080 --> 35:08.080\nAnd I was like, I think I wrote like two installments\n\n35:08.080 --> 35:09.080\nand just like walked away from it.\n\n35:09.080 --> 35:10.080\nYeah.\n\n35:10.080 --> 35:13.080\nBecause I was like, this is so long and rambling.\n\n35:13.080 --> 35:16.080\nI don't want to do this anymore.\n\n35:16.080 --> 35:21.080\nMy friend used to just do like fraudulent articles in his school newspaper\n\n35:21.080 --> 35:25.080\nand it would just be all like, there's a new Coke in the Pepsi machine\n\n35:25.080 --> 35:28.080\nbecause Russia is trying to initiate a new Red Scare\n\n35:28.080 --> 35:29.080\nor something like that.\n\n35:29.080 --> 35:30.080\nYeah.\n\n35:30.080 --> 35:31.080\nHe's ahead of his time.\n\n35:31.080 --> 35:32.080\nYeah.\n\n35:32.080 --> 35:34.080\nAnd that guy's name?\n\n35:34.080 --> 35:36.080\nReince Priebus.\n\n35:36.080 --> 35:37.080\nThank you.\n\n35:37.080 --> 35:39.080\nI got one big laugh from a dude.\n\n35:39.080 --> 35:41.080\nIt's a funny name.\n\n35:41.080 --> 35:43.080\nThat guy loves the Priebus.\n\n35:43.080 --> 35:48.080\nYou laughed harder than I hoped anybody would.\n\n35:48.080 --> 35:50.080\nI don't know how you pronounce it.\n\n35:50.080 --> 35:52.080\nYou pronounce Priebus' first name.\n\n35:52.080 --> 35:53.080\nI think it's Reince.\n\n35:53.080 --> 35:54.080\nReince.\n\n35:54.080 --> 35:55.080\nReince.\n\n35:55.080 --> 35:56.080\nReince.\n\n35:56.080 --> 35:57.080\nReince.\n\n35:57.080 --> 35:58.080\nI like that you were kind of like,\n\n35:58.080 --> 36:00.080\nthat was like after 9-11 when my grandma was like,\n\n36:00.080 --> 36:04.080\nwhat's up with that bin laden?\n\n36:04.080 --> 36:08.080\nLike you haven't heard bin laden's name said by anyone?\n\n36:08.080 --> 36:11.080\nLike that old person like impulsed\n\n36:11.080 --> 36:14.080\nlike I'm not going to fucking say the vowels of their name, right?\n\n36:14.080 --> 36:16.080\nThe fuck have they done for me?\n\n36:16.080 --> 36:17.080\nBin laden.\n\n36:17.080 --> 36:20.080\nYou still say baggle, instead of baggle.\n\n36:20.080 --> 36:24.080\nYeah, that's not because I fucking wish baggles would burn in hell\n\n36:24.080 --> 36:25.080\nbecause they fucking inged...\n\n36:25.080 --> 36:28.080\nBut you've heard the word baggle more than you said it.\n\n36:28.080 --> 36:30.080\nYou certainly must have heard the word baggle more\n\n36:30.080 --> 36:31.080\nthan you've pronounced the word baggle.\n\n36:31.080 --> 36:33.080\nMy fucking grandma just learned the word\n\n36:33.080 --> 36:34.080\nthe same time everyone else did.\n\n36:34.080 --> 36:36.080\nShe's watching the towers go down.\n\n36:36.080 --> 36:37.080\nShe sees bin laden.\n\n36:37.080 --> 36:40.080\nWolf Blitzer says bin laden.\n\n36:40.080 --> 36:41.080\nWhat the...\n\n36:41.080 --> 36:43.080\nYou telling me my fucking grandma doesn't have the option?\n\n36:43.080 --> 36:44.080\nShe's dead now.\n\n36:44.080 --> 36:45.080\nAre you happy?\n\n36:45.080 --> 36:46.080\nI am.\n\n36:46.080 --> 36:47.080\nHow is that comparable?\n\n36:47.080 --> 36:52.080\nI'm talking about you not saying baggle.\n\n36:52.080 --> 36:53.080\nYeah, I know.\n\n36:53.080 --> 36:56.080\nIt's crazy that you're drawing that parallel.\n\n36:56.080 --> 36:57.080\nIt's crazy.\n\n36:57.080 --> 36:59.080\nIt's crazy.\n\n36:59.080 --> 37:04.080\nYou can't say baggle.\n\n37:04.080 --> 37:06.080\nI try not to.\n\n37:06.080 --> 37:08.080\nI don't know what people are talking about.\n\n37:08.080 --> 37:09.080\nBaggle.\n\n37:09.080 --> 37:12.080\nIt's spelled like a fucking bag.\n\n37:12.080 --> 37:17.080\nAt this point in my life, I've tried to own it.\n\n37:17.080 --> 37:19.080\nI've tried to celebrate it.\n\n37:19.080 --> 37:21.080\nI've tried to fucking fix it.\n\n37:21.080 --> 37:24.080\nYou people are ridiculous.\n\n37:24.080 --> 37:27.080\nYou people are ridiculous.\n\n37:27.080 --> 37:29.080\nI'll apparently, every once in a while, by the way,\n\n37:29.080 --> 37:32.080\napparently I'll accidentally say baggle.\n\n37:32.080 --> 37:33.080\nBaggle.\n\n37:33.080 --> 37:35.080\nYou have to act like you're going to eat one.\n\n37:35.080 --> 37:36.080\nBaggle.\n\n37:36.080 --> 37:39.080\nApparently I'll accidentally do that sometimes\n\n37:39.080 --> 37:41.080\nbecause when I do,\n\n37:41.080 --> 37:44.080\nthat's where the shit really flies.\n\n37:44.080 --> 37:47.080\nIt's like the time I combed my hair in seventh grade.\n\n37:47.080 --> 37:49.080\nNever again.\n\n37:49.080 --> 37:51.080\nWhoa, dude, dude, whoa.\n\n37:51.080 --> 37:53.080\nYou combed your hair.\n\n37:53.080 --> 37:56.080\nYeah, like on accident.\n\n37:56.080 --> 38:00.080\nBecause believe me, I'm not taking fucking notes from you.\n\n38:00.080 --> 38:04.080\nYou fucking immaculate piece of shit.\n\n38:04.080 --> 38:09.080\nYou horrible precursor to 30 years of suffering\n\n38:09.080 --> 38:11.080\nthat will culminate in it being unfashionable\n\n38:11.080 --> 38:15.080\nfor me to be a victim?\n\n38:15.080 --> 38:20.080\nHave you ever thought about how it feels?\n\n38:20.080 --> 38:23.080\nFor my career to culminate right when old white men\n\n38:23.080 --> 38:26.080\naren't fun anymore?\n\n38:26.080 --> 38:31.080\nThink about, what did you think about me for a second?\n\n38:31.080 --> 38:34.080\nIt's high time the white men had a platform.\n\n38:34.080 --> 38:36.080\nYeah.\n\n38:36.080 --> 38:38.080\nWell, it's a high time we kept it.\n\n38:38.080 --> 38:40.080\nI guess it's what I just got here.\n\n38:40.080 --> 38:42.080\nI just got on that platform.\n\n38:42.080 --> 38:44.080\nI clambered up it.\n\n38:44.080 --> 38:46.080\nI felt like a woman.\n\n38:46.080 --> 38:48.080\nI had to work so hard.\n\n38:48.080 --> 38:50.080\nI don't even know what it's like to be white,\n\n38:50.080 --> 38:52.080\nbut it can't be any different.\n\n38:52.080 --> 38:54.080\nI'm going to explain it all.\n\n38:54.080 --> 38:57.080\nWhat do you mean you don't want to hear from me?\n\n38:57.080 --> 38:58.080\nWhere are you going?\n\n38:58.080 --> 39:02.080\nCome back.\n\n39:02.080 --> 39:04.080\nAll right, I'll just buy this house over here.\n\n39:04.080 --> 39:06.080\nHey, did you make a sketch where you fucked a baby?\n\n39:06.080 --> 39:08.080\nNo, it wasn't a real baby.\n\n39:08.080 --> 39:10.080\nBut you never heard the word bagel?\n\n39:10.080 --> 39:12.080\nGod damn it!\n\n39:12.080 --> 39:14.080\nI only ever saw it in print.\n\n39:14.080 --> 39:19.080\nI didn't grow up in a fucking fancy house like yours.\n\n39:19.080 --> 39:21.080\nHam and rules.\n\n39:21.080 --> 39:23.080\nI know how to pronounce ham and rules.\n\n39:23.080 --> 39:26.080\nYou fucking debutant.\n\n39:26.080 --> 39:29.080\nAre you saying that you were so deep into Wisconsin\n\n39:29.080 --> 39:31.080\nthat there was no bagel shops around?\n\n39:31.080 --> 39:34.080\nWe had bagels, but they were fucking...\n\n39:34.080 --> 39:36.080\nIt's not a regional thing, okay?\n\n39:36.080 --> 39:39.080\nI grew up fucking poor, and I was like...\n\n39:39.080 --> 39:40.080\nNo, you fucking didn't.\n\n39:40.080 --> 39:41.080\nYeah, I did.\n\n39:41.080 --> 39:42.080\nNo, you didn't.\n\n39:42.080 --> 39:44.080\nProve I didn't.\n\n39:44.080 --> 39:45.080\nOh, shit.\n\n39:45.080 --> 39:49.080\nShow us the tax returns.\n\n39:49.080 --> 39:50.080\nI grew up so poor.\n\n39:50.080 --> 39:51.080\nWait, I mean...\n\n39:51.080 --> 39:53.080\nHow poor were you?\n\n39:53.080 --> 39:58.080\nMy Tonka trucks were tonsil trucks.\n\n39:58.080 --> 40:01.080\nThey were removed tonsils from privileged kids\n\n40:01.080 --> 40:03.080\nwho could have their tonsils removed.\n\n40:03.080 --> 40:05.080\nMy tonsils rotted in the back of my throat,\n\n40:05.080 --> 40:07.080\nand I had to swallow them and donate my shit\n\n40:07.080 --> 40:10.080\nto the coal company that my dad worked for.\n\n40:10.080 --> 40:12.080\nAlso, I heard you were pretty poor.\n\n40:12.080 --> 40:15.080\nHow poor was he?\n\n40:15.080 --> 40:18.080\nI just told you, and I'm like a really reliable metric.\n\n40:18.080 --> 40:19.080\nNo, do another one.\n\n40:19.080 --> 40:20.080\nTop five.\n\n40:20.080 --> 40:22.080\nHow poor was Dan Harmon growing up?\n\n40:22.080 --> 40:26.080\nWhen I got...\n\n40:26.080 --> 40:29.080\nWhat'd you do with paper plates?\n\n40:29.080 --> 40:31.080\nProbably something funny.\n\n40:31.080 --> 40:34.080\nNo, you can't.\n\n40:34.080 --> 40:37.080\nDan was so poor, his uncle died\n\n40:37.080 --> 40:39.080\nand came back as a hillbilly,\n\n40:39.080 --> 40:45.080\nand the doctor called it a case of re-intarnation.\n\n40:45.080 --> 40:48.080\nThat's so fucking poor.\n\n40:48.080 --> 40:51.080\nThat's how poor Dan's family was.\n\n40:51.080 --> 40:52.080\nRe-incarnation.\n\n40:52.080 --> 40:54.080\nWow.\n\n40:54.080 --> 40:56.080\nYour family's so poor that they taught you\n\n40:56.080 --> 41:00.080\nhow to stretch a premise connection.\n\n41:00.080 --> 41:03.080\nA bartender told me that joke in Sacramento\n\n41:03.080 --> 41:05.080\nfour days ago, and I think,\n\n41:05.080 --> 41:07.080\nHere's how poor you are.\n\n41:07.080 --> 41:11.080\nTwo guys walked into a bar.\n\n41:11.080 --> 41:13.080\nMy least-in-locks were real locks there.\n\n41:13.080 --> 41:15.080\nThat's the one I had in the chamber.\n\n41:15.080 --> 41:17.080\nNow listen, we got a lot of stuff to talk about.\n\n41:17.080 --> 41:21.080\nDo you know the difference between...\n\n41:21.080 --> 41:26.080\nDale Earnhardt and Pink Floyd have in common?\n\n41:26.080 --> 41:29.080\nBoth of their last hits was The Wall.\n\n41:29.080 --> 41:32.080\nOh.\n\n41:32.080 --> 41:33.080\nThat's crass.\n\n41:33.080 --> 41:34.080\nThat's wildling humor.\n\n41:34.080 --> 41:35.080\nNo heraldry.\n\n41:35.080 --> 41:36.080\nThat's not a wildling joke.\n\n41:36.080 --> 41:37.080\nThere's no heraldry anymore.\n\n41:37.080 --> 41:39.080\nThat's a fucking good joke.\n\n41:39.080 --> 41:40.080\nNo heraldry.\n\n41:40.080 --> 41:43.080\nMaybe if the Lannisters bullied you for your whole life\n\n41:43.080 --> 41:46.080\nand you were thrown to the wolves\n\n41:46.080 --> 41:48.080\nand then you were raised by white walkers,\n\n41:48.080 --> 41:50.080\nbut you fight them enough for them to respect you,\n\n41:50.080 --> 41:53.080\nand then you were a redhead whittling in a cave.\n\n41:53.080 --> 41:55.080\nMaybe I'd let you laugh at that.\n\n41:55.080 --> 41:58.080\nIf you were like that one...\n\n41:58.080 --> 42:00.080\nWhat was your name?\n\n42:00.080 --> 42:01.080\nTeam Cersei.\n\n42:01.080 --> 42:02.080\nI'm Team Cersei.\n\n42:02.080 --> 42:03.080\nTeam Cersei?\n\n42:03.080 --> 42:06.080\nWhat about those sleeves, honey?\n\n42:06.080 --> 42:08.080\nI don't know whether to...\n\n42:08.080 --> 42:10.080\nWhere are this or...\n\n42:10.080 --> 42:12.080\nWhat is it, a slanket?\n\n42:12.080 --> 42:16.080\nAll right.\n\n42:16.080 --> 42:19.080\nI appreciate you guys being here.\n\n42:19.080 --> 42:23.080\nDan, do you know why Joseph Stalin\n\n42:23.080 --> 42:25.080\nonly wrote in lowercase letters?\n\n42:25.080 --> 42:28.080\nWait, why always...\n\n42:28.080 --> 42:31.080\nI hated capitalism.\n\n42:31.080 --> 42:37.080\nDo you know why ducks have tail feathers?\n\n42:37.080 --> 42:42.080\nTo protect their capitalism.\n\n42:42.080 --> 42:46.080\nBecause they hate capitalism.\n\n42:46.080 --> 42:47.080\nWhy?\n\n42:47.080 --> 42:50.080\nIt's to protect their butt quacks.\n\n42:50.080 --> 42:52.080\nButt quacks?\n\n42:52.080 --> 42:55.080\nBecause they're ducks, Dan.\n\n42:55.080 --> 42:58.080\nThey also have regular assholes.\n\n42:58.080 --> 43:00.080\nHave a little glee in your life.\n\n43:00.080 --> 43:03.080\nLearn how to be a child again.\n\n43:03.080 --> 43:05.080\nThat's just willful absurdity.\n\n43:05.080 --> 43:07.080\nThat's not childhood innocence.\n\n43:07.080 --> 43:10.080\nButt quacks, they also have butt cracks.\n\n43:10.080 --> 43:12.080\nThey have tail feathers.\n\n43:12.080 --> 43:14.080\nBut they don't have butt cracks.\n\n43:14.080 --> 43:16.080\nThey have butt quacks because they're ducks.\n\n43:16.080 --> 43:19.080\nThen say what do ducks go to the proctologists\n\n43:19.080 --> 43:21.080\nto have inspected?\n\n43:21.080 --> 43:23.080\nLet me answer.\n\n43:23.080 --> 43:25.080\nAsk me.\n\n43:25.080 --> 43:27.080\nYes, what?\n\n43:27.080 --> 43:29.080\nButt quacks.\n\n43:29.080 --> 43:31.080\nWhat's the difference between what I did and what you did?\n\n43:31.080 --> 43:35.080\nMine is more efficient.\n\n43:35.080 --> 43:39.080\nMine is nature saying that God gave them tail feathers\n\n43:39.080 --> 43:41.080\nto protect their butt quacks.\n\n43:41.080 --> 43:47.080\nSo they don't have to go to seek medical attention.\n\n43:47.080 --> 43:50.080\nJeff, do you comb your butt?\n\n43:50.080 --> 43:53.080\nI don't.\n\n43:53.080 --> 43:57.080\nThen why do you have a part in the middle?\n\n43:57.080 --> 44:01.080\nDo you know why the toilet paper could not cross the road?\n\n44:01.080 --> 44:04.080\nIt tee peas.\n\n44:04.080 --> 44:07.080\nIt got stuck in a crack.\n\n44:13.080 --> 44:15.080\nYeah, I mean, that works.\n\n44:15.080 --> 44:18.080\nBy the way, for the record, I approve of that kind of wordplay.\n\n44:18.080 --> 44:20.080\nI don't laugh at it.\n\n44:20.080 --> 44:22.080\nBut I'm like, okay, that scans, I'm fine.\n\n44:22.080 --> 44:25.080\nThe butt quack thing, I'm not going to, whatever.\n\n44:25.080 --> 44:30.080\nDan, a friend of mine just got a job as a security guard.\n\n44:30.080 --> 44:35.080\nAnd his boss told him, you got to watch the office.\n\n44:35.080 --> 44:40.080\nAnd he's on season three right now.\n\n44:40.080 --> 44:42.080\nHe loves it.\n\n44:42.080 --> 44:44.080\nHe hates it, but he loves it.\n\n44:44.080 --> 44:48.080\nHe's just mad it wasn't community.\n\n44:48.080 --> 44:50.080\nI don't think so.\n\n44:50.080 --> 44:53.080\nNot that we, I mean, this steam train's steaming,\n\n44:53.080 --> 44:57.080\nbut like, I was going to...\n\n44:57.080 --> 45:00.080\nI dropped a suit off of the dry cleaners.\n\n45:00.080 --> 45:03.080\nOkay, well let me, let's just make this a segment\n\n45:03.080 --> 45:05.080\nso I can sit down for it.\n\n45:05.080 --> 45:06.080\nI feel like...\n\n45:06.080 --> 45:08.080\nPress the button.\n\n45:08.080 --> 45:10.080\nWell, I tried.\n\n45:10.080 --> 45:13.080\nJeff's joke corner.\n\n45:13.080 --> 45:16.080\nJeff's joke corner.\n\n45:16.080 --> 45:19.080\nJeff's joke corner.\n\n45:19.080 --> 45:21.080\nThis is not a joke.\n\n45:21.080 --> 45:26.080\nThis is an actual slice of life daily Jeff Davis kind of information.\n\n45:26.080 --> 45:28.080\nI got one of those, too.\n\n45:28.080 --> 45:31.080\nThere's a white nationalist in the Oval Office.\n\n45:31.080 --> 45:33.080\nI could use a joke.\n\n45:33.080 --> 45:35.080\nJeff's joke corner.\n\n45:35.080 --> 45:37.080\nAll right, Spencer, you got one?\n\n45:37.080 --> 45:39.080\nWhat did the hot dog say to the sausage?\n\n45:39.080 --> 45:41.080\nNo, no, yours is going to be better.\n\n45:41.080 --> 45:43.080\nWell, that's why I want you to go first.\n\n45:43.080 --> 45:44.080\nOh, no.\n\n45:44.080 --> 45:46.080\nOkay, so I was driving down the road.\n\n45:46.080 --> 45:47.080\nWhat was it?\n\n45:47.080 --> 45:52.080\nThe five north towards Sun Valley, right?\n\n45:52.080 --> 45:57.080\nAnd I see an ambulance and it's going buck wild\n\n45:57.080 --> 46:01.080\nand the back opens up and this ice chest flies out.\n\n46:01.080 --> 46:02.080\nAnd so I pull over.\n\n46:02.080 --> 46:03.080\nWait, this really happened?\n\n46:03.080 --> 46:04.080\nOh, yeah.\n\n46:04.080 --> 46:09.080\nAnd so I pull over and I get it and there's a human toe inside.\n\n46:09.080 --> 46:10.080\nOkay.\n\n46:10.080 --> 46:11.080\nYeah.\n\n46:11.080 --> 46:12.080\nSo I called the tow truck.\n\n46:12.080 --> 46:13.080\nYes.\n\n46:13.080 --> 46:14.080\nYeah.\n\n46:14.080 --> 46:17.080\nJeff's joke corner.\n\n46:17.080 --> 46:19.080\nJeff's joke corner.\n\n46:19.080 --> 46:21.080\nOkay, I don't know how to.\n\n46:21.080 --> 46:26.080\nI'm familiar with a set of circumstances also related to the medical community\n\n46:26.080 --> 46:29.080\nthat surround a set of circumstances.\n\n46:29.080 --> 46:31.080\nBuckle up, everybody.\n\n46:31.080 --> 46:34.080\nBut I don't know the wording right because it seems to me\n\n46:34.080 --> 46:36.080\nthat the only way to tell the joke is to repeat the same word\n\n46:36.080 --> 46:37.080\nin the setup as in the punchline.\n\n46:37.080 --> 46:39.080\nThat's the part I can't figure out.\n\n46:39.080 --> 46:40.080\nThat's what's tricky.\n\n46:40.080 --> 46:43.080\nI'm going to construct it in a way that doesn't require that.\n\n46:43.080 --> 46:44.080\nYes, that's the hard part.\n\n46:44.080 --> 46:45.080\nJust shoot from the hip.\n\n46:45.080 --> 46:46.080\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n46:46.080 --> 46:47.080\nI'm going to.\n\n46:47.080 --> 46:48.080\nSpray and pray, baby.\n\n46:48.080 --> 46:53.080\nThere's a guy went into the doctor and this just happened.\n\n46:53.080 --> 46:57.080\nAnd the doctor said, hello.\n\n46:57.080 --> 46:58.080\nHow can I help you?\n\n46:58.080 --> 47:02.080\nAnd the guy was like, well, I don't know.\n\n47:02.080 --> 47:03.080\nHow do I start?\n\n47:03.080 --> 47:05.080\nLike, should you shrink me down?\n\n47:05.080 --> 47:08.080\nAnd the doctor's like, what?\n\n47:08.080 --> 47:12.080\nWell, this is not a conversation I ever have in here.\n\n47:12.080 --> 47:14.080\nWe don't have that kind of technology.\n\n47:14.080 --> 47:17.080\nAnd the guy's like, well, what do you have, like, a large bottle\n\n47:17.080 --> 47:19.080\nthat I fit in?\n\n47:19.080 --> 47:21.080\nAnd the doctor's like, well, sir, please.\n\n47:21.080 --> 47:23.080\nWe could go on like this forever.\n\n47:23.080 --> 47:25.080\nBut just explain to me what's going on.\n\n47:25.080 --> 47:29.080\nHe's like, I saw this sign outside your building.\n\n47:29.080 --> 47:35.080\nIt said, vitamin B1.\n\n47:35.080 --> 47:39.080\nYeah, Jess Joe Karner.\n\n47:39.080 --> 47:42.080\nJess Joe Karner.\n\n47:42.080 --> 47:46.080\nI'm really, I'm going to listen to a playback of the sound you guys\n\n47:46.080 --> 47:48.080\njust finished making.\n\n47:48.080 --> 47:50.080\nBecause there was a lot of victory in it.\n\n47:50.080 --> 47:52.080\nLike, I kind of thought it was like a rolling thunder.\n\n47:52.080 --> 47:53.080\nIt was good.\n\n47:53.080 --> 47:55.080\nIt was kind of like just uncomfortable.\n\n47:55.080 --> 47:56.080\nOh, yeah.\n\n47:56.080 --> 48:01.080\nBut part of it was that I like invited you into a kind of a magical world.\n\n48:01.080 --> 48:02.080\nThey were ready.\n\n48:02.080 --> 48:05.080\nLike, it wasn't like, oh, you suck to telling the joke,\n\n48:05.080 --> 48:08.080\nor that guy's dumb for wanting to be a vitamin.\n\n48:08.080 --> 48:10.080\nI do have a lot of questions about him, too.\n\n48:10.080 --> 48:12.080\nYou were like, oh, fuck.\n\n48:12.080 --> 48:13.080\nWhat kind of world is this?\n\n48:13.080 --> 48:15.080\nThis guy wants to be a vitamin that bad?\n\n48:15.080 --> 48:16.080\nJust because a sign told him?\n\n48:16.080 --> 48:17.080\nHe wanted to be a vitamin.\n\n48:17.080 --> 48:19.080\nLike, what if he passed a sign that was like,\n\n48:19.080 --> 48:22.080\nI mean, who knows what that guy could have read that day?\n\n48:22.080 --> 48:25.080\nHe's even, he's gotten to the point in his head\n\n48:25.080 --> 48:28.080\nwhere he's interpreting letters as verbs.\n\n48:28.080 --> 48:30.080\nLike, it's just B1.\n\n48:30.080 --> 48:31.080\nAnd he's like, I got it.\n\n48:31.080 --> 48:34.080\nYou didn't want to waste time on that sign.\n\n48:34.080 --> 48:36.080\nI'll go ask the doctor how to shrink me.\n\n48:36.080 --> 48:38.080\nBecause in the original joke, it's like the guy says,\n\n48:38.080 --> 48:40.080\nI want to be a vitamin.\n\n48:40.080 --> 48:41.080\nThat's not a real joke.\n\n48:41.080 --> 48:42.080\nYou can't say that.\n\n48:42.080 --> 48:44.080\nThe guy says, I want to be a vitamin.\n\n48:44.080 --> 48:45.080\nAnd the doctor says, why?\n\n48:45.080 --> 48:48.080\nAnd the guy says, because the sign said vitamin B1.\n\n48:48.080 --> 48:49.080\nWell, the doctor would be like, well,\n\n48:49.080 --> 48:52.080\nyou can't use the word vitamin and B in your fucking setup.\n\n48:52.080 --> 48:55.080\nAnd the guy would be like, I'm not a joke.\n\n48:55.080 --> 48:58.080\nThe doctor would be like, well, then you're just a psychopath.\n\n48:58.080 --> 48:59.080\nYou're dangerous.\n\n48:59.080 --> 49:03.080\nLike Sirhan, Sirhan had more going on.\n\n49:03.080 --> 49:07.080\nAnd he shot a Kennedy.\n\n49:07.080 --> 49:09.080\nAnd the guy's like, who's that?\n\n49:09.080 --> 49:11.080\nThere's jokes from the 50s.\n\n49:11.080 --> 49:14.080\nLike vitamin B1 signs were so new that people were like,\n\n49:14.080 --> 49:17.080\nwhat if this happened?\n\n49:17.080 --> 49:18.080\nPeople were so scared.\n\n49:18.080 --> 49:22.080\nVitamin advertisements were going to undermine the fabric.\n\n49:22.080 --> 49:24.080\nThey're like, hey, did you hear about that guy?\n\n49:24.080 --> 49:26.080\nSomeone's going to see that sign and walk right in there\n\n49:26.080 --> 49:29.080\nand try to turn into a vitamin.\n\n49:29.080 --> 49:32.080\nThat was their definition of problems.\n\n49:32.080 --> 49:35.080\nThey reflected growing tensions of abbreviations at the time.\n\n49:35.080 --> 49:39.080\nAnd then they went to Woodstock and they just fucked the planet.\n\n49:39.080 --> 49:41.080\nThey were like, oh, peace, love.\n\n49:41.080 --> 49:42.080\nFuck this.\n\n49:42.080 --> 49:43.080\nWhat if this is a polar ice cap?\n\n49:43.080 --> 49:44.080\nLet me smoke that.\n\n49:44.080 --> 49:46.080\nI don't even know what these people were doing.\n\n49:46.080 --> 49:49.080\nI know it's all their fault.\n\n49:49.080 --> 49:50.080\nThat's right.\n\n49:50.080 --> 49:51.080\nWell, you heard me.\n\n49:51.080 --> 49:52.080\nThere's smoke in the ice.\n\n49:52.080 --> 49:53.080\nI didn't stutter.\n\n49:53.080 --> 49:56.080\nI assume you're grandparents.\n\n49:56.080 --> 49:58.080\nMy parents, they hurt you.\n\n49:58.080 --> 49:59.080\nThey did it.\n\n49:59.080 --> 50:01.080\nWe got to blame somebody.\n\n50:01.080 --> 50:05.080\nThey love the Beatles and they ruined everything.\n\n50:05.080 --> 50:07.080\nI'm not on Twitter anymore.\n\n50:07.080 --> 50:12.080\nI can't blame the attorney general for anything.\n\n50:12.080 --> 50:14.080\nI can't remember his name.\n\n50:14.080 --> 50:17.080\nRoseanne Barr.\n\n50:17.080 --> 50:20.080\nWhat do you think of that Mueller report, Jeff?\n\n50:20.080 --> 50:21.080\nAny thoughts on that?\n\n50:21.080 --> 50:24.080\nI thought it was pretty fucking disappointing.\n\n50:24.080 --> 50:27.080\nAnd it was always going to be disappointing.\n\n50:27.080 --> 50:30.080\nAnd this motherfucker is going to get re-elected.\n\n50:30.080 --> 50:32.080\nFucking mark my words.\n\n50:32.080 --> 50:34.080\nI don't mean to be the voice of doom.\n\n50:34.080 --> 50:36.080\nBut why do you think otherwise?\n\n50:36.080 --> 50:39.080\nIs Beto at work going to come save the day?\n\n50:39.080 --> 50:40.080\nOh, yeah.\n\n50:40.080 --> 50:41.080\nHe's going to do it.\n\n50:41.080 --> 50:42.080\nNo, he's fucking not.\n\n50:42.080 --> 50:43.080\nOh, yeah.\n\n50:43.080 --> 50:44.080\nHe's going to win.\n\n50:44.080 --> 50:45.080\nNo.\n\n50:45.080 --> 50:46.080\nHe's going to win.\n\n50:46.080 --> 50:47.080\nNo, he's not.\n\n50:47.080 --> 50:49.080\nI bought 50 bucks on him winning.\n\n50:49.080 --> 50:51.080\nWe're betting tonight.\n\n50:51.080 --> 50:52.080\nWe're taking bets.\n\n50:52.080 --> 50:53.080\nI forgot.\n\n50:53.080 --> 50:54.080\nIt's March Madness.\n\n50:54.080 --> 50:55.080\nOh, yeah.\n\n50:55.080 --> 50:56.080\nPurdue in overtime.\n\n50:56.080 --> 50:57.080\nYeah, a lot.\n\n50:57.080 --> 50:58.080\nSomething.\n\n50:58.080 --> 51:02.080\nSo, Dan, did you hear that I took my suit into the dry cleaners\n\n51:02.080 --> 51:03.080\nthe other day?\n\n51:03.080 --> 51:04.080\nYeah.\n\n51:04.080 --> 51:07.080\nAs I do, because I wear a lot of suits.\n\n51:07.080 --> 51:08.080\nI'm on the road a lot.\n\n51:08.080 --> 51:09.080\nI travel.\n\n51:09.080 --> 51:10.080\nI wear a lot of suits.\n\n51:10.080 --> 51:13.080\nAnd I took my suit into the dry cleaners and she said,\n\n51:13.080 --> 51:14.080\ncome again.\n\n51:14.080 --> 51:17.080\nAnd I said, well, no, it's just a little toothpaste.\n\n51:17.080 --> 51:18.080\nYeah.\n\n51:18.080 --> 51:19.080\nI like it.\n\n51:19.080 --> 51:20.080\nI like it.\n\n51:20.080 --> 51:24.080\nBecause she assumes that I have jizz all over my suits.\n\n51:24.080 --> 51:25.080\nYeah.\n\n51:25.080 --> 51:27.080\nAnd you assume that she was like, again.\n\n51:27.080 --> 51:34.080\nI think that she's very justified because I frequently jerk off all over my suits.\n\n51:34.080 --> 51:39.080\nWell, no, it's like, it's a call of dressing like that isn't to make other people come.\n\n51:39.080 --> 51:40.080\nWhat is it?\n\n51:40.080 --> 51:41.080\nNothing.\n\n51:41.080 --> 51:42.080\nGo ahead.\n\n51:42.080 --> 51:43.080\nKeep going.\n\n51:43.080 --> 51:45.080\nI didn't assume it was your cum.\n\n51:45.080 --> 51:46.080\nShe did.\n\n51:46.080 --> 51:47.080\nHow do you know?\n\n51:47.080 --> 51:48.080\nI was thinking.\n\n51:48.080 --> 51:49.080\nTell the duck joke.\n\n51:49.080 --> 51:50.080\nOK.\n\n51:50.080 --> 51:51.080\nOK.\n\n51:51.080 --> 51:52.080\nThe duck?\n\n51:52.080 --> 51:53.080\nNo.\n\n51:53.080 --> 51:54.080\nThe guy?\n\n51:54.080 --> 51:55.080\nWait.\n\n51:55.080 --> 51:56.080\nDon't happen, Professor.\n\n51:56.080 --> 51:57.080\nI fucked up.\n\n51:57.080 --> 51:58.080\nI ruined it.\n\n51:58.080 --> 52:07.080\nThe guy goes to a brothel and he says, I want to have sex with a sex worker, but I only\n\n52:07.080 --> 52:08.480\nhave a dollar.\n\n52:08.480 --> 52:15.400\nAnd the brothel manager says, then you can use this duck and gives him a duck and he goes\n\n52:15.400 --> 52:26.560\nupstairs with the duck and he comes back down and he says, that was the best sex ever.\n\n52:26.560 --> 52:28.520\nI can't believe it only cost a dollar.\n\n52:28.520 --> 52:33.920\nI probably shouldn't feed back this much.\n\n52:33.920 --> 52:34.920\nHe's filling out.\n\n52:34.920 --> 52:35.920\nBut fuck it.\n\n52:35.920 --> 52:39.520\nI want to live in a transparent society where you should know, customer satisfaction, thumbs\n\n52:39.520 --> 52:42.320\nup, best dollar I ever spent, best sex I ever had.\n\n52:42.320 --> 52:45.960\nGoodbye, my name is Herman Johnson.\n\n52:45.960 --> 52:52.680\nFrom the North Hampshire, Johnson's.\n\n52:52.680 --> 52:55.760\nMy branch of the family represents a bit of a black sheep.\n\n52:55.760 --> 52:57.760\nApparently we have Woody Woodpecker in the crowd.\n\n52:57.760 --> 52:58.760\nDon't tell him.\n\n52:58.760 --> 53:02.400\nThat was the greatest laugh of all time.\n\n53:02.400 --> 53:04.280\nMost involuntary laugh for sure.\n\n53:04.280 --> 53:07.160\nNo one would sound that way on purpose.\n\n53:07.160 --> 53:13.320\nHe did a full on Woody Woodpecker.\n\n53:13.320 --> 53:16.400\nAnyways, that was an intentional departure.\n\n53:16.400 --> 53:21.480\nThe truth is I can tell this joke effortlessly and sound like a regular road comic.\n\n53:21.480 --> 53:24.560\nThe guy then comes back the next day.\n\n53:24.560 --> 53:26.280\nThe sun goes down and comes back up.\n\n53:26.280 --> 53:29.240\nThere's other things that happen in the town.\n\n53:29.240 --> 53:31.920\nThis isn't the most important thing that's happening in the town, but it's just where\n\n53:31.920 --> 53:33.920\nwe are.\n\n53:33.920 --> 53:42.000\nAnd the guy comes back in and he goes, I would like to have the same sex for the same price.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:47.800\nAnd they're like, here's your duck, fuck no, they don't say that.\n\n53:47.800 --> 53:52.360\nThey say, here's, fuck, they don't say anything because if they do, it fucks it up.\n\n53:52.360 --> 54:01.400\nThey put, but I also can't say, it's going to end up being a different duck and I have\n\n54:01.400 --> 54:03.160\nto work around that.\n\n54:03.160 --> 54:04.640\nHow do you do that?\n\n54:04.640 --> 54:08.560\nHow do you not refer to the duck as either the duck or a duck?\n\n54:08.560 --> 54:10.360\nI think it is the duck.\n\n54:10.360 --> 54:13.160\nHe asks for the duck and they give him a duck.\n\n54:13.160 --> 54:14.160\nDo you have the duck?\n\n54:14.160 --> 54:15.160\nOkay.\n\n54:15.160 --> 54:17.960\nI'll watch it and it says, do you have the duck?\n\n54:17.960 --> 54:20.240\nI'll have the duck again.\n\n54:20.240 --> 54:26.040\nAnd they're like, and they silently put a duck on the counter.\n\n54:26.040 --> 54:31.680\nAnd he's like, I can't believe you, white feathers, orange bills, quacks.\n\n54:31.680 --> 54:33.680\nYou can't tell this joke.\n\n54:33.680 --> 54:34.680\nYou've told it.\n\n54:34.680 --> 54:35.680\nSee you in a minute.\n\n54:35.680 --> 54:36.680\nWow.\n\n54:36.680 --> 54:43.440\nAnd I'll pay you afterward this time because even though last time it started with me telling\n\n54:43.440 --> 54:48.200\nyou how much money I had and you giving me the duck because of the price, this time the\n\n54:48.200 --> 54:52.120\ntransaction has changed even though I'm back for the same thing.\n\n54:52.120 --> 54:54.480\nThere's an unspoken sort of like, I'm good for it.\n\n54:54.480 --> 54:55.920\nI'm a satisfied customer.\n\n54:55.920 --> 54:57.000\nYou've seen my Yelp review.\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nI'm not going to bulk at the price.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:00.240\nI don't expect it to change.\n\n55:00.240 --> 55:05.520\nIt's been one day, but thanks for the duck.\n\n55:05.520 --> 55:14.520\nAnd the person's like, they just nod because the less he knows, the better at this point.\n\n55:14.520 --> 55:20.640\nSo he has again, then pause, hit pause, hold your thought.\n\n55:20.640 --> 55:21.760\nAre you fucking around?\n\n55:21.760 --> 55:24.440\nAre you really that bad at remembering this joke?\n\n55:24.440 --> 55:29.320\nI'm telling the judge, I know I'm taking longer, but I just like I'm pointing out spots that\n\n55:29.320 --> 55:30.320\nI don't.\n\n55:30.320 --> 55:31.320\nI'm getting hung up on.\n\n55:31.320 --> 55:32.320\nOkay.\n\n55:32.320 --> 55:33.320\nI'm not.\n\n55:33.320 --> 55:34.320\nOkay.\n\n55:34.320 --> 55:35.320\nPlay.\n\n55:35.320 --> 55:36.320\nIt was not the part.\n\n55:36.320 --> 55:39.120\nI did the part as a joke, like where the guy had the guy's family, whatever, like that\n\n55:39.120 --> 55:41.840\nwas a joke because I didn't think I would get hung up again by other stuff.\n\n55:41.840 --> 55:44.040\nSo he comes back in and he gets the other thing.\n\n55:44.040 --> 55:49.640\nSo he has more sex with what he thinks is the, but he just, he just, he just, he's just\n\n55:49.640 --> 55:50.640\nup there.\n\n55:50.640 --> 55:51.640\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n55:51.640 --> 55:52.640\nThe camera stays down here.\n\n55:52.640 --> 55:57.960\nAnd then he, so he comes back down with the duck.\n\n55:57.960 --> 56:00.360\nAnd by the duck, we now mean the duck he's holding.\n\n56:00.360 --> 56:03.240\nSo we're none the wiser.\n\n56:03.240 --> 56:08.920\nAnd he, and he puts it on the counter and he says, now I'm going to settle my tab.\n\n56:08.920 --> 56:16.320\nHere's the dollar that I paid last time for sex with the duck and the, and the sex worker\n\n56:16.320 --> 56:25.160\ntender says, uh, sex worker tender, welcome to the nineties, bro.\n\n56:25.160 --> 56:35.840\nUm, the kids call it being weak.\n\n56:35.840 --> 56:38.400\nYou need to get weak.\n\n56:38.400 --> 56:39.880\nOkay.\n\n56:39.880 --> 56:40.880\nOkay.\n\n56:40.880 --> 56:44.880\nSo the guy comes back down with the, with the duck, right?\n\n56:44.880 --> 56:47.560\nHe puts on the counter, he put his dollar down and he's about, he's leaving cause he\n\n56:47.560 --> 56:50.400\nfigures transaction complete.\n\n56:50.400 --> 56:54.240\nAnd the person behind the counter, let's make her a woman just because there's been nothing\n\n56:54.240 --> 56:56.200\nbut ducks and men in this story.\n\n56:56.200 --> 56:57.200\nAnd I'm not white nighting.\n\n56:57.200 --> 57:01.600\nI'm just like, and also genders construct the duck.\n\n57:01.600 --> 57:02.600\nWe don't even know.\n\n57:02.600 --> 57:03.600\nWe'll never know.\n\n57:03.600 --> 57:04.600\nWe don't have to know.\n\n57:04.600 --> 57:10.280\nI can't tell if you're doing a bit or not.\n\n57:10.280 --> 57:18.240\nLike I, how much of this is you just like the female brothel manager, the sex worker\n\n57:18.240 --> 57:24.200\nmadam feels problematic, but I don't know why you'll find out five minutes from\n\n57:24.200 --> 57:25.440\nnow and then, but it'll be too late.\n\n57:25.440 --> 57:26.440\nYou'll be fired.\n\n57:26.440 --> 57:32.920\nNova, you can you do you understand the world you're joining these walls have teeth and\n\n57:32.920 --> 57:33.920\nears.\n\n57:33.920 --> 57:34.920\nYou're a good kid.\n\n57:34.920 --> 57:35.920\nYou still have time.\n\n57:35.920 --> 57:38.640\nJust say nothing and you'll be safe.\n\n57:38.640 --> 57:42.680\nThis joke is this joke is five sentences, by the way.\n\n57:42.680 --> 57:43.680\nIt's good.\n\n57:43.680 --> 57:44.680\nThe sex trafficker.\n\n57:44.680 --> 57:48.920\nHow can you be so cavalier, madam, madam, doesn't that just seem like something that's\n\n57:48.920 --> 57:50.760\ngoing to be offensive a week from now?\n\n57:50.760 --> 57:51.760\nOkay.\n\n57:51.760 --> 57:52.760\nAll right.\n\n57:52.760 --> 57:55.000\nTake us back to stay with me.\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:56.000\nYou lead the way.\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:57.520\nLike I'll keep my eyes closed.\n\n57:57.520 --> 58:03.280\nDad, come through here right now our protagonist is where okay, so he's halfway across the\n\n58:03.280 --> 58:04.280\nroom.\n\n58:04.280 --> 58:05.280\nOkay.\n\n58:05.280 --> 58:09.320\nWell, because he put his dollar down and as far as he's concerned, this is how this\n\n58:09.320 --> 58:11.640\nplace works because he paid a dollar.\n\n58:11.640 --> 58:13.840\nHe's settled up and the madam right.\n\n58:13.840 --> 58:22.440\nI mean, yes, the sex worker tender, the sex says whoa, whoa, you're whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n58:22.440 --> 58:23.440\nCome back here.\n\n58:23.440 --> 58:24.440\nFinish paying.\n\n58:24.440 --> 58:25.440\nOh.\n\n58:25.440 --> 58:26.440\nAnd the guy's like, what?\n\n58:26.440 --> 58:29.800\nPut a dollar down and they're like, it's five dollars.\n\n58:29.800 --> 58:32.000\nHe's like, what?\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:37.080\nI came here yesterday and had sex with a duck for a dollar.\n\n58:37.080 --> 58:39.880\nAnd the manager says, yeah, that duck had AIDS.\n\n58:39.880 --> 58:47.880\nJeff's joke corner, Jeff's joke corner, Jeff's joke corner.\n\n58:47.880 --> 58:53.040\nHe's pouring drinks on his butt.\n\n58:53.040 --> 59:02.520\nYes, Joe, it failed to protect my butt quack, Jeff, Joe, I spilled a spilled drink all over\n\n59:02.520 --> 59:06.800\nit because you see it was at your long con that you're going to do that joke afterwards\n\n59:06.800 --> 59:11.000\nbecause in this universe they charge by the client's STD.\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:12.000\nIt's yeah.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:14.640\nI mean yes, but this duck doesn't have AIDS.\n\n59:14.640 --> 59:17.200\nThat's why it's about the current.\n\n59:17.200 --> 59:20.080\nWhy is this duck five dollars and then it was a dollar?\n\n59:20.080 --> 59:21.080\nWell, it does now.\n\n59:21.080 --> 59:26.760\nAll right, let me try again now that we're, now that I, now that I have all, I debugged\n\n59:26.760 --> 59:30.760\ntell it, tell it like with like pedal to the metal, I swear to God, gun to my head.\n\n59:30.760 --> 59:32.960\nLike you can, you're going to kill my family.\n\n59:32.960 --> 59:37.960\nYour two face and you're like, I'm like, I'm, I'm commissioner Gordon and like, like,\n\n59:37.960 --> 59:40.360\nlike, or wait, whose kid was going to get killed?\n\n59:40.360 --> 59:41.360\nWas it commissioner Gordon?\n\n59:41.360 --> 59:44.200\nDan Harmon tells the duck joke perfectly and fast.\n\n59:44.200 --> 59:45.200\nAll right.\n\n59:45.200 --> 59:48.000\nHe walks into a whorehouse, it's going to be problematic because I just need to like\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:51.120\nnot pause for like, it's like, it's a whorehouse.\n\n59:51.120 --> 59:53.800\nStart the fuck and it's a madam.\n\n59:53.800 --> 59:56.040\nIt really, it really is like a five or seven, seven second joke.\n\n59:56.040 --> 01:00:03.200\nMy transgender caveman friend, my non-binary, uh, tell, tell a joke about, Nova's like\n\n01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.160\nregressive fucking phraseology.\n\n01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.480\nI'm just going to go with it.\n\n01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.480\nMadams.\n\n01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:12.680\nDan, to warm up, tell the joke about what, uh, what do you call a hen that can count her\n\n01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.680\nown eggs?\n\n01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:26.520\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, feminists, what, I don't know a math, I'm a chicken now, you're\n\n01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.520\nwarmed up now.\n\n01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.520\nOkay.\n\n01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.680\nIt's, it's poultry and motion.\n\n01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.760\nYou're ready to fucking go now.\n\n01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.440\nYou are ready to tell the fucking duck joke for the first time in your life.\n\n01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.440\nYeah.\n\n01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.440\nAre you ready?\n\n01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440\nYeah.\n\n01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.440\nYeah.\n\n01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.440\nOkay.\n\n01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:50.520\nThe guy goes into a whorehouse where you get whores and he goes to the madam.\n\n01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:56.720\nIt's just such an ugly word, Nova, the, the, it goes, I, I, I, I, like, like, like, uh,\n\n01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.000\nfuck, wait, you got me nervous now.\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nIt's good.\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.200\nI want sex and I like, like, like paying for it or I wouldn't be here like, like, I can't\n\n01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200\ntell if you're doing a joke.\n\n01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.200\nWhat is it?\n\n01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.200\nWhat does he say?\n\n01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.200\nWhat do I get for a dollar?\n\n01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.200\nFor a dollar?\n\n01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.200\nYeah.\n\n01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.200\nYeah.\n\n01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200\nOkay.\n\n01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.200\nAll right.\n\n01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200\nLet me start over.\n\n01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.760\nHe walks into a whorehouse with a heart dick and a dollar and he's like, puts up on my\n\n01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.880\ndick for a dollar and the whore manager is like, take this duck and he's like, he runs\n\n01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:32.480\nupstairs and he fucks the shit out of it and he runs back down and he's like, great sex.\n\n01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.600\nNo change by, and he comes back in like a fucking hour later, he's like, more duck and\n\n01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.600\nthey give him another one.\n\n01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.600\nHe runs up.\n\n01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.400\nHe's like, fuck it, fucks it all the hell and he comes back down and goes like, oh,\n\n01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.400\nsame difference.\n\n01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.400\nLike this one's $5.\n\n01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:51.120\nHe's like, that one's more expensive than like, it doesn't have AIDS.\n\n01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:56.440\nAnd now you do probably unless it was, unless it was heteronormative sex, people don't want\n\n01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.440\nto admit as a low risk actor.\n\n01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.520\nI would say at the end, I love the speed of that one in the anger.\n\n01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.520\nIt was great.\n\n01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.080\nI think the punchline, you have to make it more of a, like a Henny Youngman kind of a\n\n01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:12.560\nI think, I like, I was imagining you like running and crossing the finish line in record\n\n01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.560\ntime.\n\n01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.400\nIt was so amazing to see you just run through that.\n\n01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.040\nI just don't know why people are so, I don't, it's a, it's a different kind of talent.\n\n01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.060\nLike people that can like, it's like a combination of like semantics, but also like this like\n\n01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:28.800\ncasualness, like because semantics like are so crucial in all these jokes.\n\n01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.240\nLike you could say the wrong thing the wrong way and it's like so crucial and I'm just\n\n01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.240\nnot used to that.\n\n01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.880\nI don't, that's not my, like, like, because every joke you tell, it's like that, like\n\n01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:42.200\nroad comic jokes, they're like, it really just come down to like this like cadence\n\n01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.320\nand like, like, oh, if you say this and then you say that and you say that in a certain\n\n01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.760\nrhythm and I really don't, I don't, I can't, I always fuck it up because it's like the\n\n01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:54.240\nguy's got to say like, like, like, oh, I don't know, like, yeah, I can't, I can't\n\n01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.240\nrefer to example.\n\n01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.360\nI mean, I'm obsessed with stupid jokes and I love when people tell me one like the re-enternation\n\n01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.480\none is a great joke.\n\n01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.960\nThe soup one, I remember that, I think that one's pretty basic, like, there's a guy who\n\n01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:16.600\ngoes to, well, he doesn't go to anybody, it's his wife, we're off to a flying start, by\n\n01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.600\nthe way, I love it.\n\n01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.800\nWell, some of this stuff, it's like, if my first draft is too long in the beginning,\n\n01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.360\nthat doesn't, like, you can just edit that.\n\n01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.680\nI mean, not in the podcast, I mean, just whatever, it's not a failure is my point, like, it's\n\n01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.680\nme working something out.\n\n01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.240\nTell me a fucking soup joke.\n\n01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:38.160\nThere's a woman that says, goes to a helper in a society, like, whatever, I don't know\n\n01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.320\nif it's like a sex coach or something, like, I don't know who you'd go to for this.\n\n01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.360\nThere's a woman that goes to- It's her husband.\n\n01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.960\nNo, you don't, what?\n\n01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.960\nWhat soup joke are you talking about?\n\n01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.840\nNo, her husband's going to be there with the punchline, you can't, she can't be open\n\n01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.320\nwith him about her sexual goals, like, they have to play out like a crazy thing.\n\n01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320\nWe'll see it.\n\n01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.320\nIs it a waiter?\n\n01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.880\nWell, she goes to, everyone's heard this joke.\n\n01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.760\nShe goes to a sexual mentor, I don't know if that, I don't know where you went.\n\n01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.760\nIs that a therapist?\n\n01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.960\nShe goes to a sex therapist.\n\n01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.960\nThank you, Nova.\n\n01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:15.600\nIt's still a little problematic, I think, and says, like, I have my husband's not having\n\n01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:21.440\nsex with me, I don't, like, I want to encourage that more than discourage it, the therapist\n\n01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:28.640\nsays, like, why don't you do something like magnificent and adventurous and involving\n\n01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:34.120\ndifferent outfits and, you know, like, you know, I don't, I'm not telling you to doll\n\n01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:40.560\nit up, but, like, at the same time, like, sometimes just a little distance from the\n\n01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.480\nprocess can, like, like, you know, last thing I'm going to do is tell you, like, you're\n\n01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.840\nnot hot enough for your husband, I'm just telling you, like, like, like, like, maybe\n\n01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.040\nsex needs to become adventurous again, it needs to become more of an adventure.\n\n01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.400\nThis is a fucking four-line joke.\n\n01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.240\nSo then, because based on that advice, here's what she does, you're making it harder with\n\n01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.920\nyour jeering.\n\n01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:08.760\nShe goes home, it's moving fast enough for almost anybody, it's like, you know how long\n\n01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.800\nit took for Robocop to become a Robocop?\n\n01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.200\nThis is a crazier story than that.\n\n01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.520\nThat guy just got shot, I could say that fast, this guy wanted to be a cop, and then he was\n\n01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.760\nlike too much of a cowboy cop, so he put himself in harm's way, but he didn't know the corporations\n\n01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:28.000\nthat were running the cops, like, actually, were placing high-risk candidates in different\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.560\ndistricts according to their needs for a donor, aka a half-dead body, I mean, long story short,\n\n01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.040\nthis guy's part of, like, a backup plan, like, a pork barrel, like, law enforcement plan\n\n01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.680\nwith a corporation that really is pumping all their money in this thing called the Ed\n\n01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:47.920\n209, which is this, like, urban pacification thing, it's a fucking four-line joke.\n\n01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:52.240\nAnd so our hero, who just wants to impress his son based on this show TJ Laser, like,\n\n01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.400\nhe ends up in old Detroit, and he's like, dead or alive, you're coming with me, they\n\n01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:01.400\nshoot his arms and legs off, he ends up Robocop, that's less crazy than this fucking shit\n\n01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:05.560\nwith these people that want to have sex so bad that they get in outfits, like, I mean,\n\n01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.080\nthere's nothing wrong with that, but, like, this woman's just, like, bent on self-destruction.\n\n01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.520\nYou're doing a bit, you're trying to not go to jail.\n\n01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:18.520\nShe goes home, I'm just telling you, this movie would be longer than Robocop, she goes\n\n01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:25.240\nhome, she gets into a, I can't use the word, because you can't use the punchline, like,\n\n01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:31.120\nshe gets into an outfit, like, oh, it's got a cape, it's got, like, a belt, it's got boots.\n\n01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.800\nShe's like, adventure, you gotta do adventure as sex, because that's what she's thinking.\n\n01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:42.080\nAnd so then the husband's, like, in his bed, the husband's in his bed, he's doing a crossford\n\n01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:50.680\npuzzle that night, she... Oh, that, that, that becomes important later on in the joke.\n\n01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.720\nIt does because of his... The fact that he's a crossword enthusiast becomes very important\n\n01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.920\nlater on. It's so important, it is important.\n\n01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.240\nOkay. It's, he's... Yeah, no, it's the whole joke.\n\n01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.280\nThe joke is that he's... He doesn't look up from the crossword when\n\n01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:09.400\nhe does the punchline. Okay, go ahead.\n\n01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.160\nThe thing that I'm fucked up, though, is the, why, did he, is she in the closet the\n\n01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.720\nwhole night, because... It's a fucking four-line joke.\n\n01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:21.440\nIt's four cents. I want to retract some stuff, so she, she\n\n01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.760\nearlier was trying the outfit on, so make sure it fits, so that he came home and they\n\n01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.760\nplayed tribute for shoot. I don't, I don't know if you just love talking\n\n01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.640\nso much, and you hate jokes that much, but are you really trying to get it right?\n\n01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:35.960\nIt can't be both. I, I don't hate talking. Okay.\n\n01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.160\nIt used to be how I got people like me. All right. Then I started doing this shit.\n\n01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.600\nOkay. But that's good, that's good.\n\n01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.560\nTake it from the top. I should, I should have to do other stuff.\n\n01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.840\nTake it, take it from the top. Don't eat blood? What do you people want?\n\n01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:52.840\nSorry, I lashed out. The woman tries on the outfit, so just retcon\n\n01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.600\nthat. Like, if it was like Black Orphan or what's that show?\n\n01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.600\nLike, like where you're like... What is it?\n\n01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.040\nOrphan Black. I would, I would ask what the fuck you're\n\n01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.160\ntalking about. You guys haven't seen Black Orphan?\n\n01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:11.560\nIt's a four fucking sentence joke. You just love your fucking mainstream\n\n01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.760\nentertainment. Watch Black Orphan. Get back to me.\n\n01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:19.040\nIt's fucking badass. And it might not be enjoyable for you.\n\n01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:27.320\nMaybe a couple of things you might not want to hear about yourself.\n\n01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:34.680\nThat's funny for reasons no one will understand, but me later at home.\n\n01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.840\nI mark spots on the podcast where you're like, yeah.\n\n01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.400\nSo she already has this plan. So he comes home, he goes, where's my crossword?\n\n01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.560\nShe's like, where you left it? He gets in bed. They do the thing.\n\n01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:49.280\nIt's like, it's going to be a regular stagnant night, but not tonight, not according to her.\n\n01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.480\nShe's going to do this thing. So she's like, I'm going to go do something.\n\n01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.040\nHe's like, what are you doing? He's like, I'll tell you in a second.\n\n01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:59.360\nShe goes to the closet. They have like a place. It's like a, like there's room in the closet.\n\n01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.800\nSo she can change. She closes the door. He can't see her.\n\n01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:07.160\nHe changes. So she comes out of the closet and she's, she's wearing a red cape.\n\n01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.040\nShe's wearing red boots. She's wearing this whole outfit.\n\n01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.880\nI can't refer to the, I can't refer to the costume because it's coming up.\n\n01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.560\nIf I refer to it, if I describe it in the way that would make you go, yeah, I got it.\n\n01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.840\nSo I have to go through every fucking article of clothing because if I say the wrong word,\n\n01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:26.000\nI ruin the punch line. So she, I have to describe the fucking cape and\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.920\na thing. She's got an S on her fucking.\n\n01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:35.400\nThis is my fucking hell right now. And she goes like super pussy and the, and the husband\n\n01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:42.200\nwithout looking up from his crossword says, I'll have the soup wait. No, he looks at her\n\n01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.800\nand then looks back at the crossword because otherwise you'd mistake it for like he just\n\n01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.360\nloved soup and there was a semantic that he looks up from the crossword and it wasn't\n\n01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:58.040\nrelevant for him to be a crossword, right? Well, why is it a crossword because he has\n\n01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.680\nto like look at her and then look back at something, an iPad. I don't care.\n\n01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.360\nYou got to think like a borscht belt, like old school Jewish comment, like a borscht\n\n01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:12.680\nbelt who tells a joke at the speed of light and the details mean nothing.\n\n01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.360\nWell, congratulations to them.\n\n01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.720\nThank you for Trump borscht belt generation. Maybe you should be more detail oriented.\n\n01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:27.560\nAn old couple are celebrating their 70th anniversary. The man is in bed reading a\n\n01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:32.440\npaper. The woman wants to spice things up and she ties a towel around her neck like Superman\n\n01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.520\nand she comes out of the bathroom naked with a towel around her neck and she goes super pussy\n\n01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:40.760\nand he looks up from the paper and he says, I'll have the soup. Like that's that's how\n\n01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:48.760\nfucking short that joke is. Do you want the thousand questions? Why is it crossword?\n\n01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:53.000\nWhy did she think that was going to spice anything up? Because she just seen Superman\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.040\ntoo because she's a big fan of a big fan of Richard Donner who got fired off of that,\n\n01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:03.320\neven though he wrote the screenplay but was fired off of it. And Richard Pryor, I believe,\n\n01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:08.760\nor that's three fucking. But if she had a towel around her neck, why was she she probably was\n\n01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:13.320\nlike, Oh, no, sorry, this isn't to wipe up your soup. I'm not a waiter. Tell the Thor joke.\n\n01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:21.880\nThor joke. The Thor. Thor walks into a bar and the bartender is like, Hey, we don't serve your\n\n01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:29.560\nkind here. And he's like, What kind? I'm a God from Ragnarok from the rainbow bridge of like\n\n01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:39.480\nElsa guard. And Elsa goon. The bartender's like the exits are two to the rear and two to the\n\n01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:48.440\nside of her. Don't use those ones. I don't know. No, why did it's why did how come how come how\n\n01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:56.120\ncome what what why? Well, I got I have it. I have it. How come how come? Why is being a\n\n01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:06.200\nwhy is it? Why is it? Why is it? Why is the why? Why is the job of physical therapy on meth right\n\n01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:13.560\nnow? Why is it profitable to become a physical therapist in Asgard because a lot of everyone's\n\n01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:19.640\nThor. Yeah, but they're not all Thor, but you know, they're not all Thor, but\n\n01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:27.640\nbut over time, I could have figured it out. Is that the Thor joke? I think it was not a speech\n\n01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:32.040\ntherapist. No, the Thor joke is no, they're well, they're so well. Yeah, I know that it's not the\n\n01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:38.120\nword sword, but you just don't get my comedy and like, I don't know what to tell you.\n\n01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:45.240\nYeah. Like it kills at colleges. So like, and those guys read for a living. So\n\n01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:52.920\nyou just don't get me, man. You like watching these Netflix comedy specials and you're like,\n\n01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:58.440\nthis is easy, but like that was a fucking killer joke. Make up a brand new like joke,\n\n01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:04.040\njoke like a dad joke. Wait, what was the Thor joke? Well, an ant walks into a\n\n01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:10.520\na or just a bar bar. Okay. Is the whole joke going to go like that? No, you're going to\n\n01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:16.280\nnot a heavy shoulder me. He just orders a drink. Just say you ordered a drink. You pause. I don't\n\n01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.440\nknow how much longer I'm going to put up with this, but he orders a drink because in the spirit\n\n01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:27.400\nof collaboration and I hope it's inspiring. I'm inspired every day. So he orders a drink. Now\n\n01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:32.280\njust keep in mind. He didn't have to. Yeah. No, he's being very nice about a lot of shit that\n\n01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.800\nhappens in these bar jokes where the person doesn't even order a drink. Like for instance,\n\n01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.440\nthe lobster goes into a bar and he and the bartender is like, get the fuck out of here.\n\n01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:45.480\nIt's as I love that joke that the bartender is just like, get out of here. Get out of here.\n\n01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:52.920\nLobster. That's funny. It's funny before the punchline. This is like, this is funny that\n\n01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:58.760\nlike a bartender, that's it. Get out of here. He's immediately fucked up and there's like one guy\n\n01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.480\nat the bar that's like, the fuck was that about the bartender? He's like that guy. He's always\n\n01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:09.160\ndoing this stuff. He fucked it up, but that part doesn't matter. He gives me nothing but this.\n\n01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:13.400\nThere's nothing but this. I mean, it's a thing. It's semantics, but it's like, you know, the idea\n\n01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.200\nis that he's a lobster and the bartender has a problem with him doing that, but it's like,\n\n01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:21.240\nthe lobster does that naturally. That's not like, but I think it's just funnier that the bartender\n\n01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:31.960\nis mad. Get out of here. Now, finish your joke. Why be a bartender at that point?\n\n01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:38.280\nThat's like, I mean, a lobster walking into the bar is going to get you that tightly wound.\n\n01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.880\nWhat kind of bar allows lobsters to walk down the fucking road in the first place?\n\n01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.120\nEspecially if it turns out that the reason is because he's doing this, which is what lobsters\n\n01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:51.080\ndo. So like the guy should be like, okay, so so far all I'm hearing is that a lobster sometimes\n\n01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.560\ncomes into your bar and you've chosen to be like more of a regular bartender that doesn't have\n\n01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.400\nlobster. Like you got it. You got like a bar. I mean, maybe this is a universe where lobsters\n\n01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:06.520\nare like, and men are like, you know, it's like, maybe like what it's like ABC's caveman series\n\n01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:12.680\nwhere it was like, like, oh, cavemen are like half of society. Remember, it's based on that\n\n01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:18.040\nGeico commercial. Who's good? Nick Kroll. Finish the ant joke. So an ant goes into a bar.\n\n01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:22.120\nAn ant goes in the bar. And that's why my only point was that I could have chosen for the bartender\n\n01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:27.160\nto be like, get out of here. But you you made it a bar instead of a dirt mound. You said you\n\n01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:32.040\nhad to get a drink. No, my hands are tied. Like, let's let's let's tell this amazing joke. Let's\n\n01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:39.960\nerase the chalkboard and ant goes where? Oh, shit. It goes into a hill of dirt. Okay. Like\n\n01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:47.560\nbecause I'm not afraid of like organic humor. I'm like, doesn't have to go to a bar. It goes into a\n\n01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:53.320\nwhere an ant goes. He goes into one of those hills of dirt that ants make. And he got and the and\n\n01:15:53.320 --> 01:16:00.680\nthe the guard at the entrance is like, hey, who goes there? And he's like, it's me, Glenn.\n\n01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:10.680\nAnd the ants like, okay, go through. Do you smell any picnics? And the aunt Glenn is like,\n\n01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:24.200\nwould I be back? And then and the guard is like, yeah, for the queen. And Glenn is like, honey.\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.600\nSo there's got to be some gay joke there, right? Like something about like he said something sassy\n\n01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:39.160\nlike like about like, like, like, I wouldn't go above a hundred and third or something. I don't\n\n01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:43.960\nknow. It's kind of it's like like a picnic or something like for the queen. Spencer do it and\n\n01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:49.640\nthat goes into a bar joke like and that goes into bar. Now I still like my the tavern keepers like,\n\n01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:59.800\nget out of here. Just because it's like you don't want ants. It's just what Dan liked about the\n\n01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:06.840\nlobster joke except applied to ants. It's that easy. It's not what is that? What is that? I wasn't\n\n01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:11.560\ntrying. You're not going to trick me. And the Barger says the Barger. Thank you for seeing\n\n01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.960\nthrough Jeff's clever tricks. It's part of bull. Look, I was bullied my whole life. I know what\n\n01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.040\nbullies do. They're like, oh, see, he's fucking cool. He combs his hair. I'm like, I'm not going\n\n01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:26.200\nto fucking be mad at a nerd that comes as air. Yeah, fucking fascist is capitalism. All right.\n\n01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:35.320\nA a walrus, then a walrus, a walrus goes into a bar goes into a bar. Are you sure? You can pick\n\n01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:44.440\nthe venue. A walrus goes into a blank. You get to pick the venue. A walrus. I don't like I\n\n01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:52.120\nI you saw how I don't even put me in that area and I set me up for success. Yeah. Well, but then\n\n01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.760\nthere is sex happening. A walrus was into a bar. It's probably easier because a whorehouse is like\n\n01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:03.160\na bar where you instead of boarding drinks, you order like a sex bar. So if I could get over my\n\n01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.320\nfucking a walrus rocks walks into a walrus walks into a whorehouse and it's like,\n\n01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:15.160\nokay, I want to have sex. And the person's like, well, do you have money?\n\n01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:23.720\nAnd he's like, no, but I have tusks. And they're made of ivory. So they're like, well,\n\n01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:29.560\nwe can't they're attached to you. And he's like, yeah, but how about this? Like,\n\n01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:35.880\nlike, if you if you if you let me have sex, then I'll cut off one of my tusks, and I'll give it to\n\n01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:39.560\nyou. And they're like, why don't you do that first? And he's like, give me a saw. And they're like,\n\n01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:50.760\nwe don't have a saw. And he's like, you can buy a saw with the tusk I give you. And they're like,\n\n01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:55.000\nhow are you going to give it to us if you don't have a saw? And he's like, you know what? I'm a\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:02.920\nseal. These are fake. And I'm not coming back. And he throws down these like plastic hollow,\n\n01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:08.280\nlike Halloween store tusks that he was just like keeping in there. And they're like, what are you\n\n01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:13.480\ndoing? And he's like, I'm out of here. The joke's finished. And they're like, it's not a joke. I'm\n\n01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:20.040\na human being and the seals like spoken like a person in a joke. And the seals just gone. And\n\n01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:26.680\nthen this person's like, who am I? And then another person comes up and goes like, can I have sex?\n\n01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:31.240\nAnd they're like, yeah, everyone can. It's never been that difficult. I don't know what I did\n\n01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:36.120\nwrong. It's my first day here. I've been yelled at three times. This is fucking crazy. I'll admit\n\n01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:41.400\nthe first two times were my fault. I can see it that way. I'm new here. However, I'm freaking out.\n\n01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:45.720\nI don't think I should have dropped out of architecture school. And the other person says,\n\n01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:51.080\nyou were an architect? Yeah. I mean, I was in school. I wasn't an architect. I'm an architect\n\n01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:58.200\nand I never went to school. What's your name? Frank Lloyd Wright says the person. But the\n\n01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:01.960\narchitecture student knows it's not Frank Lloyd Wright. They went to school. They've seen pictures\n\n01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:08.520\nof Frank Lloyd Wright. That's not Frank Lloyd Wright. It's like a guy with like big giant teeth.\n\n01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:16.600\nSo the kid that went to architecture school is like, oh, I get it. This town is just filled\n\n01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:24.680\nwith people that needlessly disguise themselves as species with like tusks. And they just fuck\n\n01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:29.960\nwith people. It doesn't explain the other fuckups I had this morning, but I'm getting it now.\n\n01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:35.800\nAnd so they go, all right, Mr. Lloyd Wright, nice to meet you. Would you like to have sex?\n\n01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:42.280\nIs there anything I can interest you in? And the person that's not Frank Lloyd Wright for sure\n\n01:20:42.280 --> 01:21:00.120\nis like, yeah, do you have anything in an Asian woman with a dress on and a hat?\n\n01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:11.080\nAnd can the hat be filled with money? And the person's been trained to never say no.\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.520\nAnd they go, well, first of all, the answer is yes. It's just a question of how much.\n\n01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:22.760\nWe have all that. We can get that. How much are you willing to pay? And Frank Lloyd Wright says,\n\n01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:31.800\nhow much money is going to be in the hat? And the person's like, how much money do you want\n\n01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:36.840\nto be in the hat? Because it's like your fantasy, right? Frank Lloyd Wright says a million dollars.\n\n01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:42.520\nI want a million dollars in the hat. And the person's like, okay, that'll be a million dollars and\n\n01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:49.000\na hundred dollars is what that will cost around there. I'm not really authorized to like me.\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:56.040\nThat's an estimate. An estimate? What the fuck am I standing here for? Why am I embarrassing\n\n01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:02.360\nmyself having these conversations? I'm like, you can't authorize this transaction? Are you asking\n\n01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:07.720\nme if I'm allowed to put a million dollars in a hat, find a person based on their race, dress\n\n01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:17.560\nthem in an outfit, and then, no, I'm not. And Frank Lloyd Wright's like, do you realize that\n\n01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:23.800\nwhen they taught me how to build buildings, I know how to take them apart. And the architecture\n\n01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.920\nstudent's like, you didn't go to school, you said. And he's like, I'm talking about my grandpappy.\n\n01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.480\nAnd the student's like, I'm going to go get your Asian woman and your million dollars,\n\n01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:41.080\nI'll be right back. And he goes in the kitchen and he goes to his manager and goes like, I quit.\n\n01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:47.640\nHe's had enough at this point. Yeah, I'm out. And you can go deal with this. And like,\n\n01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.640\nit's been a fucking intense day. And like, I don't want any more to do with this.\n\n01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:55.560\nSo the manager goes and like, frankly, it's like tapping his foot. It's not Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\n01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:02.440\nBecause he thought he thought the job of being a clerk at the front of house at a whorehouse was\n\n01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:06.520\ngoing to be a lot easier of a job. His dad's a senator. He's like, you should work at the whore\n\n01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:12.520\nhouse. Like that way people come in, they get herpes, they get whores, they like it's a win-win\n\n01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.320\nlike you've got something on people. That's how I became a senator. That's how you're going to\n\n01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:19.720\nbecome a senator. Like you got to work around where the fucking is happening. Like this is like a\n\n01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:23.320\nthis is America, you know, when they say make America great again, this is when America was great.\n\n01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:31.640\nSo finally, he's at a breaking point. And he goes to his boss and says, I quit, manager goes out.\n\n01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:35.160\nFrank Lloyd Wright is not Frank Lloyd Wright is out there. He's like tapping his foot. He's looking\n\n01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:40.040\nat the gold vision of all is like looking at the grandfather clock is like like pacing and like\n\n01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:44.760\nand the manager's like, are you okay? And Frank is like the guy that isn't Frank Lloyd Wright is\n\n01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:55.560\nlike, yeah, uh, no. And this whole argument happens in like the long story short is like the\n\n01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:59.720\nwhorehouse closes. It's out of business because it's just like what the guy the guy wasn't Frank\n\n01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.200\nLloyd Wright, but he was like a like a media magnate. Is that what you call him? Sure. Like a\n\n01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:09.160\nkind of a Hearst figure. Gotcha. And so basically controls the media at that time. Right. And like\n\n01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.840\nit just just puts a bunch of stuff. He was trying to do a scam. Yeah, I don't know if he caught on,\n\n01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:16.440\nbut like he wanted he thought he could get a million dollars this way. And like,\n\n01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:24.440\neven if he put the hundred down up front, like it was like he was going to rob. Yeah. Yeah. Right.\n\n01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:28.840\nSo he overestimated how much money you're allowed to have in a place like that. And like what the\n\n01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.080\nkids authorized to do. And he just basically but he was so humiliated that he basically bankrupted\n\n01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:37.000\nhimself in his newspaper, putting the whorehouse out of business. That's an entire town collapsed.\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.280\nThey no longer had any literacy or uh, hedonism. They didn't. It was basically a barber and a\n\n01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:48.120\ntrain station there. Like if unless you were like that freaked out about getting a haircut,\n\n01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:53.160\nthere was no way you're going to come to this town. That's how uh, the fantasy island ended. Yeah.\n\n01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:01.000\nSo I'm sorry. There's no punchline, but the truth is sometimes life gets pretty ugly.\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.240\nYou know, you can't just go into a whorehouse and have a crazy animal encounter. Like these people\n\n01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:14.760\nhave lives and uh, we all exist as part of one web, you know, like when that whorehouse dissolved\n\n01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:21.320\nits uh, like corporation, they like, how did that go down? It was that. Well, they were in\n\n01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:27.560\nsolvent. Yeah. I mean, it was already a quasi legal business. This was just happening at the\n\n01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:33.720\nright at like the vanguard of a manifest destiny. Like it was just like you're out there in an\n\n01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.280\nunincorporated city in the middle of some territory. No one knows what's going on. And it's just like\n\n01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:42.840\nsex was a business and you know, shit rolls downhill. Sure. They sell you the dream. Like,\n\n01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:47.560\noh, you can, you can, you know, anybody can become rich, but it's like what they really mean is like\n\n01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:52.760\nanybody can, you know, die. Like everything's, everything has a price on it. Like human life\n\n01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:58.440\nis worth less than a bullet, man. And what happened to the guy that wanted to go in there\n\n01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:03.640\nfor the encounter? The newspaper man? Yeah. Oh, he died. His newspaper went out of business.\n\n01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:07.320\nHis newspaper went out of business. He ended up a prospector and he got a claim jumped.\n\n01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:14.440\nHoly shit. Yeah. He didn't even have a claim. He was trying to, he's trying to do, like the guy,\n\n01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:19.880\nyou met the guy in this joke, which wasn't a joke, by the way. He was, what he was trying to do with\n\n01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.560\nthat. He just like, he went, he took that. He didn't learn his lesson. He's like, he's like,\n\n01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:27.160\nhe would, he decided he was going to become rich by pretending that he found gold\n\n01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:32.520\nand saying, I found gold. Does anybody have any money to, I can turn it into silver or something?\n\n01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.520\nDo you think? They just beat him over the head. Do you think before he went into that whorehouse\n\n01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:41.480\nand asked for a whore with a million dollars in her hat, do you think he had successfully pulled\n\n01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:47.160\nthat off? In his mind, yeah, but he was born rich. And like, so he basically like lied to like\n\n01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:53.400\nguidance counselors, people on his dad's payroll. Like he didn't, he mistook like being privileged\n\n01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:58.680\nfor being crafty. Like it's like, try getting away with the shit that this guy, this non-Frank\n\n01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:04.360\nlike. What kind of whorehouse is also carrying around a million in cash? Ask a fucking dipshit son\n\n01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.800\nof a billionaire that like walks in and like tries to do that. Like the guy, it was just,\n\n01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:13.080\nhe could have stayed at home and sucked on his dad's titty, but oh, that wouldn't have suited\n\n01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.160\nhis ego. Oh, I got to go, I got to go out. I'm going to go tame the wild. I'm going to go bulk\n\n01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.960\npeople out of their money and like write a book about it. Dumb. He traveled only by hot air balloon.\n\n01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.920\nHe was a terrible person. It's just like, he just exuded everything that was wrong with the American\n\n01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:34.600\ndream. And this is colonialism. This is 1915. 1915. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And he traveled by\n\n01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:41.240\nBarnaby Johnson was his name. Barnaby Johnson. He caused World War one. He caused it. He caused\n\n01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:48.600\nit a year after it started. Yeah. Okay. He made people think it started earlier than it did.\n\n01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.800\nYeah. World War one was essentially like a resolvable skirmish. Tell me what you think was\n\n01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:59.240\nthe worst moment. And I want you to be specific about World War one. What do you think was the\n\n01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:05.400\ndarkest hour? I got to go to Verdun, bro. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Break it down. Right. Everybody\n\n01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:13.160\nknows. What country? Obviously France. Like, but like, what, hey, what country was which?\n\n01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.400\nWhy were they fighting? Who knows where that was? Like, they thought they were going to\n\n01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:23.320\nchange the answer with their trenches, buddy. And, uh, and their mustard gas and they invented\n\n01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:29.480\nthe water balloon and the fucking torture and the, this is the only war where it started on horseback\n\n01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:37.560\nand it ended in a balloon. And that's where our whorehouse entrepreneur whorehouse is finance\n\n01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.600\nworld war one. They called them the silent generation, the people that went to fight the\n\n01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:48.200\nthe mustard gas made them quiet and they had to eat rats and they were hats that look like\n\n01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:55.480\npie tins and they were just like pink Floyd's song about them. Everybody had a rifle and\n\n01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:00.600\nand, uh, everything was muddy and gross and the boots were like up to your calf and and it's just\n\n01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:06.680\na bad scene. What do you, what's your opinions on the war of 1812? Oh, what a misunderstanding.\n\n01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:14.600\nThe war that traveled faster than the telegraph. Let me tell you that. Boy, that that war could\n\n01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:18.520\nhave been, could have been, we could have saved ourselves a war. We had had a telephone back\n\n01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:26.440\nthen. It's all I knew. I was a war of misunderstanding. They called it the war of 1812. The Canadians\n\n01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:34.120\nburnt down the White House. I know, I know more than the president and I'm an idiot.\n\n01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:41.400\nYeah, I can name half of our Supreme Court justices by all the words to baby got back.\n\n01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:50.280\nUh, what's your, uh, what war Dan, do you think, you know, the most about?\n\n01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:56.040\nUh, Vietnam for sure. Because, you know, because you were in, you were in the shit. Yeah.\n\n01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:02.680\nYou, you were, uh, what you were lieutenant in Denang. Yeah.\n\n01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:08.760\nOkay. So, all right. See, they don't want to talk about it. Well, I don't, you know,\n\n01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:12.120\nit doesn't seem like they don't like to talk about it. That's a real soldier.\n\n01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:15.160\nIt feels like I'm at a dentist because they were there. Yeah.\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:26.280\nCoyotes. So, so I saw the coyote. I saw a coyote that from the brambles behind my house.\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.600\nYeah. Is that the neighbor's yard or is that a no man's land?\n\n01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.360\nI think it's, well, it's, I think it's one of those two. I don't think there's any\n\n01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:39.560\nscenario in which it's my property. Right. That's, but I just like, cause I could climb up there and\n\n01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:45.320\nstart hacking, but I think there's no partition leading into the neighbor's yard. I don't think\n\n01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:49.160\nyou should do that because it's got to be, that's, that's, I mean, we have reason to\n\n01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:54.520\nsuspect that that's the neighbor's property. So, I think what we need to do is, uh,\n\n01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:59.560\nI think, I don't know what the first step is because what we can't do is call the city because\n\n01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:03.720\nwe know that the, if you call the city, they will say, we don't do that anymore.\n\n01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:10.040\nYou're on your own. And there's like companies, which evokes like black water that will come\n\n01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:19.320\nput the hurt on your coyotes. Um, and, uh, I, I just, like, all I know is, as the Barack Obama\n\n01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:25.720\nof this coyote problem, that like future will judge me like, like by whether I acted or didn't act,\n\n01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:31.240\nand that I don't need to like be decisive. I'm not saying like slaughter the coyotes or put,\n\n01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:38.120\nI demand this. Like, but I, I'm saying like, I think that neighbor whose territory borders mine,\n\n01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:46.520\nI think that it's possible that, um, the, uh, pug, the elderly pug that, that twice has fallen\n\n01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:51.960\ninto my yard. I think that dog died. I mean, if it, if it didn't, if it didn't get eaten by\n\n01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:57.160\ncoyotes, it died of old age because I think it died from falling. Well, I mean, yeah, it couldn't\n\n01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:02.040\nbe, it's fall, like, and my dogs are so sweet, they would like guard it and they were like nice\n\n01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:05.720\nto it. They're like, Oh, a dog fell in our yard and they would like take care of it and like,\n\n01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:11.640\num, and then both times, once my ex-wife, Erin McGathy, and once my dogs that are Allison,\n\n01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:15.960\nlike they, I was never here for these two events, but it happens twice. And like they both times,\n\n01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:21.560\num, one of those two characters, like they're not characters. They're human beings. They're\n\n01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:28.600\nhuman beings. They're not characters. God damn it. Harmon. Never let it slip. Don't let them know\n\n01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:36.520\nyou're, they're all in your story. If they realize it, they can end the book. I've met them both\n\n01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:43.400\nand they're real characters. He met that, like, they're kind of like, characters. That's my,\n\n01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:51.240\nwhat, why? You mean humans? You forgot the word for human. Um, but you don't just call people\n\n01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:59.000\nhumans. They sound like an alien. I don't know people. People sounds like, like, you know,\n\n01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:05.240\nword peoples, like both of these people. You mean your ex-wife? What do you mean you people?\n\n01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:10.600\nIt's your ex-wife. I don't know what you said. She was a real like TBS. She was a real character.\n\n01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:15.560\nHow do you refer to a group of people if one's your ex-wife and one's your dogs? Those people\n\n01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:25.080\nwomen? No, that would be a crazy. That was both of those women. That would be weird.\n\n01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:30.280\nI mean, thank you for continuing to prove that I was right in being hung up on that and\n\n01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:34.040\nand barfed out the word character. And there was like, what are you, Dr. Who?\n\n01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:42.360\nAnyways, so like they took the dog up the hill and they found the owner of that territory. I live\n\n01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:48.440\nin these windy hills. So it's like, for instance, my neighbor, the Bootsons, we've met on this show\n\n01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:58.040\nseveral times. If I go over to their house for a party and I do Hollywood, I actually have to either\n\n01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:03.720\nclimb over a fence, which actually almost makes more sense. It's kind of weirder what I have to do\n\n01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:08.440\nif I don't want to climb over a fence, which is I have to walk all the way around with Cody like a\n\n01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:12.360\nwhole or a whole block because their house is right next door to me, but their address is at a\n\n01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:16.520\ncompletely different street. And the fence isn't that high. It's like hip. Yeah. And I was telling\n\n01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:21.160\nthem last time, we're going to make like a gate in this fence because also we're living in the\n\n01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:26.360\nend time. So like there's going to be like a weird like ice agent showing up and going like,\n\n01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:32.920\nI understand you have the people in your floorboards and we're going to want to have tunnels in our\n\n01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:39.080\nfucking rich liberal neighborhood and arsenic to put in their tea. Oh, please come in. Yes.\n\n01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:46.840\nI was just telling my housekeeper how American we all are. More chamomile.\n\n01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:57.960\nAh, yes. I like your community show. Yes. If there was less black people in it,\n\n01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:11.240\nlike the Liao season when they all quit. Donald Glover is kaboot. I got you. Yeah.\n\n01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:20.280\nI'm so blue. I'm turning blue because I poisoned you. Nazi. What? Why? You're so white.\n\n01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:24.600\nBecause I'm a good white guy. I hate fucking Nazis, bro.\n\n01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.560\nBecause I'm fucking raised by fucking real Americans. We hate fucking Nazis. That's\n\n01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:33.720\nthat's just the thing you made up after you got into the war for a profit.\n\n01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:39.560\nOh, come on. Don't be so fucking cynical, you prick. Come on. We went to war with you fucking.\n\n01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:46.120\nYou're going to say cock sucker. See, because you're fucking you are Nazi. Yeah, you wish.\n\n01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:50.280\nIt's different. You just want everybody to mistrust themselves and you're fucking you.\n\n01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:55.160\nI'm going to watch you die. I'm going to spit on you while you die with your fucking dumb eagle\n\n01:35:55.160 --> 01:36:03.640\nmedals. Oh, I love my eagle medals. Stupid skull on your hat. You look so dumb.\n\n01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:11.400\nHate you. You know why you hate me, right? Yeah. What? What are you going to tell me?\n\n01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.680\nWe're not so different than how come you're dying and I made you tea?\n\n01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:21.320\nYou see me in a fucking eagle hat? We're not so different. Go ahead. Do your monologue purple\n\n01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:35.560\ndying Nazi. You hate me because you secretly wish you for one moment of your life could feel the\n\n01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:45.400\nthe having one and two Emmys. What you want to what one for community one for Rick. No,\n\n01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:50.440\nI never won one for community, but it was such a good show. Yeah, that's you're making my point.\n\n01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:58.200\nPeople who are proud of their race are like coming to the conversation saying I have nothing\n\n01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:04.440\nto be proud of. If you were talented, you wouldn't be a Nazi. I'm tired. I'm killing myself. I can't\n\n01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:10.760\nlisten to another fucking episode of your bullshit. You're fucking crazy with your ranting. It ruined\n\n01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:15.400\nyour podcast when Trump got elected. What would you do? I thought you loved them. I do, but I\n\n01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:22.680\ndon't want to listen to you blather about it. Oh, he shot himself. Bing bong. Fuck shit. Hello.\n\n01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:31.720\nHello. Sorry to bug you with the Nazi supervisors and we sent a Nazi over to\n\n01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:39.800\nharangue and have tea and it's been more than 20 minutes and I really don't want to. I saw the\n\n01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:45.880\naddress. I'm like Rick and Morty. I love. Oh, no, no. Yeah, he just shot himself. What the\n\n01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:57.880\nWhat's that mean shit? Oh, okay. Oh shit. Fika. Fika. Isn't that what they take out of your\n\n01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:08.600\npaycheck? Move out of my way. Oh, Hans. Why did he do it? He said he loved Jews.\n\n01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:22.200\nIs that all he said? Why would he say that to you? I don't know, dude, you guys are complicated.\n\n01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:28.440\nYou're what are you going to tell me you all go to therapy? He was fucked up. That gets to the bone.\n\n01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:36.680\nI'm a big fan of your work. I know I'm not just a Rick and Morty fan. I also have read your blog.\n\n01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:43.240\nI followed you my whole life and although you've had your ups and downs,\n\n01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:51.560\nyou're sort of window into the complexity of mathematical chickens.\n\n01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:03.400\nBy the way, where is Jeff Davis? Oh, he lives close by. Knock knock. Oh shit. It's Jeff.\n\n01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:09.880\nMaybe the zeppelin dropped him. Oh, Jeff, there's Nazis here. Oh shit. One of them killed\n\n01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:13.480\nthemselves. Okay. Wow. The other one came to pick him up and that's everything's fine.\n\n01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:19.480\nThis seems like a bad time. No, it's the best time. I mean, it's not as good as when America was great,\n\n01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:25.000\nwhich you will never pin me down on when that was. I just want it again.\n\n01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:33.160\nYou know, like when I was 10, like when the Muppets were syndicated, make America great again.\n\n01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.440\nI like it to be great again before I met a black person.\n\n01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:42.760\nI can see by the insignia on your lapel that you're a colonel.\n\n01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:52.200\nI'm a colonel first class Yeti edition, super special forces, secret double tier platinum,\n\n01:39:53.880 --> 01:40:03.480\ndouble bead, through line, double strength, titanium, fully creasoned commander of the ultimate\n\n01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:09.160\ndeath platoon, a fucking like million. I had to kill like a million homeless people.\n\n01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:12.680\nHey, Dan, do you do you have any beers in the fridge? Yeah, there's Grohl's\n\n01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:21.160\nbecause when in Rome, okay, I open the fridge. So anyways, when did you go from being in ice to\n\n01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:28.840\nbeing a full blown German soldier? Yeah, that just it's like a Christopher Durang, like mystical\n\n01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:35.320\nrealism, the kind of like I just became just a general Nazi. You know why Hitler killed himself,\n\n01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:43.160\nright? He was a he was an angry drunk. No, that's why he stopped drinking, right? Which I never\n\n01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:50.600\nunderstood that you know why he killed himself. Gas belt, gas belt. So I don't like the joke.\n\n01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:56.520\nI don't like the joke. And I'll tell you why kids trivializes victims. It's a great joke.\n\n01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:00.760\nIt's not a great joke. It's not a great joke, because it's like, it's like, oh, yeah, he\n\n01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:05.880\ngassed a lot of people. But it's like, it's, you know what, you know, the only way it wouldn't\n\n01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:11.000\nmake it a better joke. But you know, you have to he saw his gas bill, and it had all the names of\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:17.960\nall the victims. And here are their names. Why is that six million names later? It's still not\n\n01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.720\na funny joke, but at least you're a good person. Like because it's like, yeah, like those people\n\n01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:27.960\nthose are the people that aren't laughing. They couldn't join us. You know, I you know how you\n\n01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:35.800\ntie the shoes in little Nazis. Oh, see, that's that's yeah, because it's like when Hitler's\n\n01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:40.200\nlike Dracula, that's when it's funny. When it's like, oh, do you know what is he? What is he?\n\n01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:46.120\nWhy does he like the radio because he like likes us to the hitlers? I don't know. Like that's not\n\n01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.800\nI can't do it. I can't riff it. All right. That's why some of the stuff's joke. Don't get mad at me\n\n01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:55.160\nfor failing to do a Hitler joke. You're bad people. What could be Hitler jokes are better?\n\n01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:01.960\nWait, so because I'm because I'm a good person. Why are the ice people actually like full on\n\n01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:07.560\nlike full blown Nazis? In the situation? Oh, yeah, well, I asked the same question. But the answer\n\n01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:15.080\nis why why was why did Robin Williams head float in the Baron Munchausen because Terry Gilliam's\n\n01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:23.240\nlike like like, hey, come on, because he was let's do it drunk. Anyways, you know that Stalin joke\n\n01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:29.240\nwith the capitalism, you could do that with the DSA. It'd be like more modern. You know, it's like\n\n01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:35.080\nwhy does the DSA only spelled in lowercase or something? Right? Yeah, just thought I'd circle\n\n01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:41.960\nback around for that. They might they might they might send you 10,000 tweets though. No,\n\n01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:47.480\nthey'll love it. They'll be like, holy shit, go on chapeau. They love saying that. Yeah, they love\n\n01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:53.080\nto drag your fat ass and then tell you to go on chapeau. They love dragging fat asses. I like\n\n01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:59.720\nI got that treatment because I made a joke about how it's funny that McDonald's ended up like\n\n01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:05.080\nsuffering for not licensing Rick and Morty but still trying to like do a Rick and Morty thing\n\n01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.760\nwith the Szechuan sausage. It's like, yeah, you got it. I made one joke about it. I was just like,\n\n01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:13.960\noh, I've told that story. That was the worst day of my Twitter life. And it wasn't the day I quit\n\n01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:18.360\nTwitter. I was just like, I was like, walked into this thing. I had no idea the world had changed\n\n01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:23.160\nthat fucking much that that much was at stake. I was like, I thought you could safely make a joke\n\n01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:28.360\nabout how McDonald's sucks for like being a corporation and like, like, who cares if they\n\n01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:35.080\nhave a bad day at the hands of the worst fans of this show? Who cares? And I was like, one person\n\n01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:38.600\nwas like, you know, it's kind of fucked up. Like some people work at McDonald's. It didn't identify\n\n01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:42.760\nthemselves. I was like, I was like, you know, or he's like, he was like, it's just to rip off a back\n\n01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:47.800\nto the future. Fuck you. Why should McDonald's have to pay for your property if you rip off back to\n\n01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:53.640\nthe future? And his his his Twitter icon was him in a Rick fucking costume with green things on\n\n01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.840\nhis lip. And I said, you got some flux capacitor on your fucking lip there, like Mr fucking property\n\n01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:02.600\nmanager. And he's like, okay, here's the thing. I work at McDonald's and I was on this channel,\n\n01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:06.840\nand I'm like, I said some shit to him. And then it was like, there were socialists watching me\n\n01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:11.640\nyell at him. Where I was like, because it took like hours for the kid to just go, I was a cashier\n\n01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:15.400\nat McDonald's. And I feel like a piece of shit, because I work for McDonald's. And I don't want\n\n01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:19.160\na bunch of fucking weird incels jumping up on counters yelling at me, because I don't know,\n\n01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.480\nit's Szechuan sauce from your fucking show. And I was basically like, yeah, so it took you all that\n\n01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:28.760\nfucking time to just say, like, you have a fucking agenda in the conversation. I don't have a fucking\n\n01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:32.840\nagenda. I'm just hanging out going, I think it's funny that this corporation didn't pay for this.\n\n01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:37.320\nI can afford to laugh. You're just fucking like doing this shit. And then it got all like, there's\n\n01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:42.360\nall this, hey, everybody, Dan Harmon's doing an edgelord rant against a socialist that just wants\n\n01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:49.480\nminimum wage. And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. I hate everyone. I that's fun. I now hate everyone.\n\n01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:56.760\nI hate my fans. I hate the minimum wage workers. I who else can I hate? I hate rich people. I am\n\n01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:04.120\none. Now I hate myself. I'm just going to crawl into a fucking shell and have a great life.\n\n01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:12.040\nHey, Spencer, do you have our character sheets? Yeah, come on. That's I mean, I love to play D&D,\n\n01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:19.320\nbut that you added your messages. Fuck you. No, you're doing a podcast. My message is we have 15\n\n01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:25.240\nminutes left. And I would like to play a fast lightning round of combat with me and you and\n\n01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:31.800\nI'm Chad. Combat each other. Huh? Yeah. Huh? Well, you want to fight me? You're like, no,\n\n01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:38.120\nyou and I are in a dungeon. Like we're in a combat round. Yeah. So you are going to fight each other.\n\n01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:41.880\nI thought you were like a Milwaukee friend that was like, come on, let's wrestle in the front yard.\n\n01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:45.400\nLike I just told me that you're jealous. It's been so long. I forgotten your characters.\n\n01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:50.280\nI forgot your character's name, Dan. It's been that long. Yeah. Well, yeah, I don't know where I\n\n01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:57.960\nmean, what's your character? I don't know. Spencer, what's, what's Dan's character called?\n\n01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:04.840\nOr audience? Oh, Carlos, the intermissive. And I'm Chad, the fire liker. I have a story that I can\n\n01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:11.960\njam into a real short thing because I was like, I was, I was like looking for a microphone for my\n\n01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:19.720\nfor my iPad pro so I could sing a song into my iPad pro. And I was looking for a microphone\n\n01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:24.120\nbecause it needed like, like it was a, it was a bunch of Michigan guys, like how you,\n\n01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:27.800\nthey got a USB-C port or whatever. It's like, like, oh, you got to be more, you got to have a thing.\n\n01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.720\nI was like searching through my closet for a microphone and I was like, God damn it. Where's\n\n01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:36.360\nthat? I think I had an XLR thing. It's like been here since I dabbled in any of this shit.\n\n01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:39.880\nWhere is this thing? And I'm getting real frustrated. And I find this unopened package\n\n01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:46.760\nthat was a Citronella dog collar. It's like, like anti barking collar for, for that I had bought\n\n01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:52.200\nfrom Amazon, I think maybe in some fit. And like, I never opened it. And I was like looking at\n\n01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:57.640\nit's covered in dust. I was like, oh, anti barking collar. And there's like a picture on the,\n\n01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.480\non the package of like a dog. It's like,\n\n01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:06.600\nit's like, yeah, what's he going to do? It's just, he looks contrite.\n\n01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:11.800\nYou can tell from his eyes that like a mailman's near him, but he's like, there he is again.\n\n01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:18.120\nAnd last time I don't hear anything from me about it. And I just, I was like, shit man,\n\n01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:22.600\nHarvey barks a lot. Like, like he's always barking. He's a fucking loud dog. He's always\n\n01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:26.120\nbe barks at other dogs. He barks at everybody. And then I was like, dude, you're looking for a\n\n01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:34.360\nmicrophone. That's what I was like when I was listening to the story. I was like, yeah, yeah,\n\n01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.920\nwhat about the microphone? Exactly. Like I bark like Harvey doesn't have a podcast. Harvey\n\n01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:43.400\ndoesn't like, like I'm barking all the time. Like Harvey's just like, he's got one mode of expression.\n\n01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:47.240\nLike I'm not, and if you're listening and you're like, I have a citronella collar for my dog.\n\n01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:52.120\nI'm not, I'm not, I'm not high-roading you at all. I, I, I, I, because I live in a,\n\n01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:57.320\nHarvey barking doesn't, it's not hurting anybody. It annoys me, but like it doesn't,\n\n01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:01.400\nit's not like anybody else is complaining about it or whatever. If you live in an apartment and\n\n01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:05.720\nyou got a dog and you used a citronella collar, that seems like a, I'm not, I'm not going to be\n\n01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:09.800\none of those people. That's not the point of my story. But I was like, Harvey's just like, he's\n\n01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:13.800\njust, he has his own little podcast. Like he just, he likes to bark. Like, like he's got,\n\n01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:17.400\nhe doesn't even have thumbs. He just like has little legs that like carry him from one place\n\n01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:23.000\nwhere he can bark to another. And I kind of, and then today I was sort of like, because I, I felt\n\n01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.600\nthat way. I was like, I watched him like play with the next door neighbor dog. And then there was\n\n01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:30.120\nlike some other, there was a neighbor walking his dogs. And I said to Harvey, it was like,\n\n01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:33.880\nbuddy, there's some dogs over there. Don't you want to bark at them? Because he wasn't\n\n01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:37.080\neven barking at him. He was like, wanted to fetch a ball. And I was like, I don't think you saw\n\n01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:41.720\nthose dogs though. And he like saw him and he's like, rough, rough. And the neighbor like waved\n\n01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.040\nat me and I was like, yay. And then like, and then and then and then Harvey finished barking.\n\n01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:50.920\nAnd I was like, good job. And it was like the same, the same stuff happened, except I wasn't\n\n01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:55.720\nlike miserable about it because I wasn't like, oh, he's not supposed to do that. Like, you know,\n\n01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:07.640\nhe's just, it's just his podcast. What, what are we doing? You're in a dungeon? Is that\n\n01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:11.000\nwhat you wanted? What did you, what were we saying? We only have like 10 minutes. Like,\n\n01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.640\nlike, let's just, let's just throw us into the fire right now. Well, yeah. Okay.\n\n01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:22.520\nDan, you're gonna leave this up. None of you guys know what's going on.\n\n01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:27.320\nI bet the last thing I said is let's go make a potato farm. Right. I was like,\n\n01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.080\nI was like, let this guy work on Harmon Quest.\n\n01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:32.680\nUh huh. What is that?\n\n01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:44.520\nWait, so can we just like play like a lightning round of D&D? Yeah, but Steve plays. That's part\n\n01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:52.760\nof it. Is Levy here? I don't know. Levy. I, Levy, Steve Levy, everybody. Steve Levy.\n\n01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:05.640\nWhat's happening? Are you, I, what have you done since I talked to you about the coyotes?\n\n01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.520\nI, I did a quick search online if there was an organization or a person who handles anything\n\n01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:17.160\nlike that. And here comes the Christopher Walken character in this Adam Sandler movie.\n\n01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:24.920\nDidn't, didn't seem like there is. I'm here to take care of you coyotes. Sorry. I don't think\n\n01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:27.400\nthere's a person for that. Are you sure you want to play D&D? You don't want to do the scene of\n\n01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.760\nChristopher Walken? I'm showing up to take care of my coyotes. Why don't you want to play D&D?\n\n01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:39.160\nYeah, I'd love to. Hey. I distracted him. Knock, knock, knock. Why? Who's, who's there? Me.\n\n01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:49.880\nMe, who? Sorry. No, I'll start over. Knock, knock. Who's there? Dwayne. Dwayne who? Dwayne\n\n01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:57.480\nthe Tub. I'm drowning. There's a name. There's a, there's a famous name Dwayne. That sounds\n\n01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:04.840\nmore like the word drain than Dwayne. Doesn't matter. Look, I, I saw a rogue family of coyotes\n\n01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:10.200\nin your yard. Oh shit. Are you Christopher Walken? Yes. I'm Christopher Walken. Come in.\n\n01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:16.360\nThe famous actor. Thank you. Come in. Come in. Thank you. I could have come in without you even\n\n01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:26.680\nopening the door. Oh my God. Yeah. You got coyotes. Yeah. I called about, I called the city, but\n\n01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:31.720\nthey said they couldn't send anyone, but then you must then get called. There's only one way\n\n01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:39.640\nto get rid of coyotes. Did you bring me out to talk about coyotes? Who the fuck is this guy?\n\n01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:44.280\nThis is my assistant Steve Levy. I told him to call people about coyotes. This is Christopher\n\n01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:51.560\nWalken. Steve, he's famous. He's from Hollywood. I'm an actor. Yeah. I hate coyotes as much as\n\n01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:56.200\nanyone does. Do you want to come back and look at the spot where I think there's a nest?\n\n01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:03.400\nCoyotes have a nest? Yeah, they have nests. What did you think they had? Can I, can I bring\n\n01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:14.520\nmy friend and Jeff Goldblum? Yeah, yeah, you can. Okay. Hey, Jeff, come in. Jeff Goldblum,\n\n01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:27.320\nI want you to come in here and help me with this coyote nest. That looks like a problem.\n\n01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:36.680\nHey, Jeff, I know you hate coyotes too. Well, it's not, Chris, if I can correct you,\n\n01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:51.480\nit's not that I hate a coyote. It's just that they once ate my cat. Well, Chris,\n\n01:52:51.480 --> 01:53:03.160\nhelp Dan Harmon. He created Rick and Morty. Oh, it's funny you mentioned that. I was binge watching\n\n01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:13.480\nR&M as much as I call it. And I thought that the last season was very good. Oh, thank you.\n\n01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:19.080\nOh, Dan Harmon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, Jeff. Hi. Hey, Dan. I like you on criminal intent. I mean,\n\n01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:28.600\nit's... Well, that's very kind of you. Dan, I gotta tell you, it's very kind of you to say that.\n\n01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:34.920\nI don't think it was my best work. I actually wish that Alicia Witt would have kept like working on\n\n01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:39.880\nthe show. I really liked her. Well, you're very sweet, Dan. You're very sweet. Let's go kill some\n\n01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:53.160\ncoyotes. Okay, you go out back. There's a coyote nest near the south wall of the property.\n\n01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:59.000\nI cast... Wait, do you guys hate me? What is this?\n\n01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:12.120\nNo, but I understand you. Do you? I do. I do. Do you accept that I am as confused as you are?\n\n01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:17.320\nI did earlier and then at a point I was like, well, maybe he doesn't.\n\n01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:24.040\nI wanted to play D&D and then it became Jeff Goldblum. Did you really want to play D&D for 10\n\n01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:28.520\nminutes or did you feel like me? Like, sometimes it's just like, what are you trying to do with\n\n01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:33.960\nme? What about a flop in your app? Can we do a quick combat round with coyotes in Dan's backyard\n\n01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:42.120\nwith Chris Walken and Steve Levy? You were all... You were just doing that. Yeah, but let's start\n\n01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:49.480\nthe combat. That's not like... That's a bread crumb. I don't care about that. Okay, all right.\n\n01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:56.040\nJust do that then. No, no, no, no. Now, let's just lay the seeds of a D&D thing.\n\n01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:03.720\nWell, now finally, it's now the point where it's not long enough. That's what's weird about it.\n\n01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:09.000\nAll right, suspense. Lay down what's going on in Dan's backyard. There's coyotes.\n\n01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:09.500\nCome on.\n\n01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:17.960\nI am livid. No, in the D&D campaign, not the backyard.\n\n01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:26.280\nThere's no time. We have three minutes. That's not ten minutes.\n\n01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:35.640\nAll right, three minutes of D&D. No, jeez.\n\n01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:39.640\nBro, just run it.\n\n01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:50.360\nI can't. I'm sorry. I don't normally cow to hecklers, but if there's ever been a situation\n\n01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:58.520\nwhere a bro needed to just run it. I mean, talk about a voice of reason.\n\n01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:07.800\nNo, but like remember earlier when you're like, oh, we don't have any time. Yeah,\n\n01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:15.560\nlike that concern is now valid. Like back then it was less. It wasn't invalid. What about this\n\n01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:21.240\npressure? What if you lay down the intro to like where we were at? You decided to become\n\n01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:28.840\npotato farmers? That was already said. Okay, okay. That's the whole thing. So so so tell us\n\n01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:34.360\nI mean like we're wearing what's been a while that we're working on the potato farm right\n\n01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:39.720\nor no you decided to become potato. Okay. Yeah, so we don't control what happened.\n\n01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:42.440\nTell us what happened. Just run it bro.\n\n01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:53.320\nBro. They're willing to stay for another eight minutes. I really\n\n01:56:53.320 --> 01:57:03.400\nlove\n\n01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:15.320\nhey uh hey uh Chad and uh your Chad I'm Chad Carlos and that with Goldblum to Goldblum kept calling\n\n01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:23.080\nwhat's I forgot his name I don't uh what's Carlos now you're Carlos you're\n\n01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:33.160\noh yeah diary jr. Hey Carlos DJ got some bad news for you. We got a low potato yield.\n\n01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:38.200\nFuck it looks like we're gonna have to go out and kill some people to make some money because\n\n01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:43.000\nthe potatoes are not gonna bring in what we thought we're gonna make. Well you say that every harvest\n\n01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:51.080\nwell we're we're bad at potato harvesting. Yeah but we were worse at killing people and it's a\n\n01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:57.720\nworse thing to do. I think we are better. I mean we like look around and count your potatoes.\n\n01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:04.120\nI like to think it's quality over quantity. They're pretty damn good potatoes. They're good potatoes\n\n01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:10.360\nyou like the taste. They were yeah. Uh look I don't want you guys know how many potatoes it takes\n\n01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:21.080\nto kill an Irishman. Zero? Yeah none. What's an Irishman? Yeah. Do you do you know what do you\n\n01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:31.560\nknow what kind of meat a priest is allowed to eat on Fridays? Fish? None. It's an old from the old\n\n01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:39.640\ndo you take that Catholics? Does Friday a thing with them? I don't even know. I as much as I like\n\n01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:45.560\nthe lifestyle of being a gentleman farmer. I kind of miss the days of traveling and being on\n\n01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:49.240\nbeing on quests. You never became farmers.\n\n01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:58.280\nWell well it'd be nice to know that a while ago. I said you decided to become farmers. Yes we\n\n01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:05.880\nfucking did. No that's not what deciding means. Okay well okay you run it bro. Oh Jesus Christ\n\n01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:12.120\nthat that makes a lot of sense. The reason why we never grew any potatoes is that we never\n\n01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:21.000\nseeded or harvested any actual potato. Come on you can't you you don't you don't you're not like\n\n01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:27.960\nour monkey. I get that but like if you don't want to do it then like we're you know do you want to\n\n01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:34.040\ntell us what happened instead of us becoming farmers because that you decided to become farmers\n\n01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:39.400\nright we decided and then we ended and then that was it. Okay so like oh you're saying like you're\n\n01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:44.840\nnot allowed to like advance time and assume that you you need to roll for several seasons of potato\n\n01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:50.200\nfarming or okay all right. I mean we could talk all about all of that. He's like we're not we're\n\n01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:54.600\nnot going to let time have passed between seasons like we're starting where we left off. I feel\n\n01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:59.400\nlike we left. I thought you wanted to become potato. I thought that's what you wanted to be doing.\n\n01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:07.000\nI didn't know that's what I'm not doing. I say to DJ and to Carlos I don't want to be a potato\n\n02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:12.680\nfarmer. I want to I want to. But you've been one for three years now. Yes. No. No. I mean I don't.\n\n02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:24.600\nI want to go work for the church of the silver flame. Well you haven't had enough of that.\n\n02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:31.160\nWe didn't get it right. Let's let's let's for the first time in our lives go like go do something\n\n02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:38.360\nthat matters. Then what? I prayed. Spencer what's the God of the silver flame is there a name? The\n\n02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:47.560\nsilver flame. I get on one knee because they don't like it when you're on both knees. I say\n\n02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:55.880\nsilver flame. Guide us. Let us redeem ourselves. Send us a mission. Send us a cause.\n\n02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:03.880\nTo go defend you for. All right. A potato falls in your lap.\n\n02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:20.520\nYou have a lap when you kneel. I mean I was on one knee so there's a half lap.\n\n02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:27.720\nFucked up. Jesus. Weird. I found a magic potato. I opened up the magic potato to\n\n02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:31.160\nsee if there's anything inside the magic potato. No it's just broken in half now.\n\n02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:37.720\nDamn dude you're good at opening those potatoes. I get down on my other knee and I say\n\n02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:45.160\nsilver flame. If that truly was you send me another message. What in the.\n\n02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:54.360\nI just say that. Well I don't need another sign. That's fucking that's more than you\n\n02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:59.480\nshould be able to ask for. I was right. I think well I guess nothing happened so I\n\n02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:03.320\nguess that we're just potato farmers now. Well we decided we were going to be.\n\n02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:13.560\nI wouldn't say we were. Can I invite my friend Jeff Goldblum over.\n\n02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.920\nNo I'm kidding. I didn't mean to make that sound that implied that the answer is no.\n\n02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:27.240\nLook the truth is you guys don't have to come with me. It's not like.\n\n02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:32.360\nWe're not potato farmers. We're warriors. We're spiritual warriors. We've done nothing\n\n02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:37.160\nbut fail. We never remember what we're doing. Why do you wake up at 8 a.m. every morning and\n\n02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:44.120\nlift and pump iron if you're not. That's not potato prepping you know. You're getting ready for\n\n02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.880\nsomething. You're not a potato prepper. That's me. That's me trying to live past 47.\n\n02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:56.680\nBecause I like milkshakes and Philly cheese steaks. And my fiance who's 12 years younger\n\n02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:00.520\nthan me and a woman which means she has 24 more years on average to live than me.\n\n02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:03.880\nI don't want to like die going like oh man.\n\n02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:15.640\nDon't break the fourth wall. Hey this character doesn't work out. Can I give you guys like\n\n02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:22.040\neasy pitch. Let's stop potato farming. That's not what we're meant to do. You're at your pit.\n\n02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:27.800\nYou're acting like you're subversive now. We haven't even started potato farming and you're\n\n02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:33.560\nlike what if we. So one thing we haven't tried. Look I'm. What were you going to say. I just\n\n02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:39.720\nI just pick a direction and then I'm like OK great. And then the next episode happens and\n\n02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:44.200\nyou go the opposite direction. So like the last time you're like what if we were potato farmers\n\n02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:49.400\nand I was like OK. Right. And now you're like all you're doing is like we can't be potato farmers.\n\n02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:54.040\nNot me. I'm not doing. No I know. But it's just like. But it's like.\n\n02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:59.400\nThe only if the only thing you want know is that you don't want to do the thing there is.\n\n02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:04.360\nThat's not the only thing that I know. Right. I'm stopping you there. But this is the loyal you.\n\n02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:09.720\nAll right. Right. If the only thing one does is nothing then nothing gets done. Yeah I get that\n\n02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:13.080\nright is why I wanted to become a potato farmer because I was like that's a thing I can remember\n\n02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:18.360\nthrough a blackout drunk to the next episode. Like we're because I felt like we're you perceive\n\n02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:26.840\nme or us or the royal we as like disrespecting the game. I know I'm always like the impetus\n\n02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:32.440\nbetween me behind me. The potato farming thing was honestly like as usual which I've done it\n\n02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:37.880\nbefore where I'm just kind of like we're like we're like shitting all over this thing that Spencer\n\n02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:41.800\npreps for like we never know what we're doing and we always end up like burning people's houses\n\n02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.360\ndown and it's like not like we don't know what we're doing. We're always like oh what's your\n\n02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:50.280\nname. The person's like my name is Todd. I've known me for 11 years and we're like yeah but I thought\n\n02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:54.120\nyou were Todd. We're like no the elephant's Todd and then he's like excited about horses and then\n\n02:04:54.120 --> 02:05:00.600\nwe're just like like we just kill people and then we don't know and I just like I dream of like\n\n02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:06.920\nI'm like oh well maybe if we reset and we're just like like we make it simple like willow and we\n\n02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:12.120\njust go plow a field and then we can just fucking really carefully like if an adventure comes along\n\n02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:18.920\nwe can like be like okay like we can't fuck this up and we'll just be like let's baby step this and\n\n02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:25.320\nlike let's take it seriously and not fuck it up. It's just my it's my it's my desire to do well.\n\n02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:31.240\nNo I get all that. I get all that. It's it's just again it's that now you're not doing that\n\n02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:35.800\nand that's all you're spending time doing. I thought I was trying to get us out of potato\n\n02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:41.480\nfarming and just try to like trigger like that we were going to go on a new quest. I think you\n\n02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:49.480\nshould you you should let me potato farm because it seems like a thing that needs to happen to you\n\n02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:55.400\nbecause you don't want it to happen. Okay I use my skill of wild empathy.\n\n02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:03.400\nThat makes me befriend animals. I befriend animals\n\n02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:10.600\nand can I conjure an animal or is that animal I already have to be there?\n\n02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:17.720\nWell that would be like a separate spell. It's been it's been good adventuring with you boys.\n\n02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:23.400\nAll right like look I'm bored. I don't want to be a potato farmer. I know I know if that's your\n\n02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:28.040\ngang like I can dig it. I didn't mean to I didn't mean to pitch it like it's something I think we\n\n02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:37.160\nshould all do. I feel bad. I feel like a bad person. I feel bad at what I do. I feel like I\n\n02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:41.240\ndon't know how to do it right and I want to experience the thing that normal people experience\n\n02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:46.120\nwhich is like oh shit I'm mad about this so I want to do it. I know exactly what I want to do\n\n02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:50.280\nand it's like I get orders from the church and then I'm like reacting to a backstory and I forget\n\n02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:55.160\nthese details and it's just a tangled mess. I just always feel like I'm a fucking guest\n\n02:06:55.160 --> 02:07:03.240\nat some party thrown by a stranger. The stranger is me. We worship a flame and it's not even the\n\n02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:11.880\ncolor of regular flame. I haven't lost my faith in our God.\n\n02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:21.480\nJust lost my faith in myself. Why don't you talk it out like maybe like in a rhythmic way.\n\n02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:33.720\nI think you're suggesting that I invent singing and I'm right. You invent rapping. You can sing it.\n\n02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:40.600\nDo it Stevie Nicks style because she just got inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\n02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:52.440\nor you can test it like drinking. I don't want to know what a waterfall does.\n\n02:07:52.440 --> 02:08:04.360\nWaterfalls do fine. I don't need to know why the leaves go down.\n\n02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:10.200\nJust something that leaves the side\n\n02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:22.600\nbecause when the planet goes round and round the people feel safe and sound but the devils\n\n02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:34.520\nin the hollow earth help the Jews plan 9-11. They were worn out of the buildings.\n\n02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:47.400\nYou can Google it. Cliff Hanger. Thank you for coming to Harmon Channel everybody. Steve Levy.\n\n02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:54.040\nThere's more to that song and it actually turns out. I'm your Comptroller Jeff Davis.\n\n02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:58.120\nThank you all for coming. Thank you for Zach up there laying down the jam.\n\n02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:04.440\nYour Game Master who didn't get to Game Master anything is Spencer Crittenden.\n\n02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:09.880\nHow about your mayor, Dan Harmon everybody.
