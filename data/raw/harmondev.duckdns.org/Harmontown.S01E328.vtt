00:00.000 --> 00:23.200
Hello everybody, I'm Jeff Davis, I'm your Comptroller, Carmen Town, from downtown, from

00:23.200 --> 00:27.760
these prestigious heroin and get stabbed district of Los Angeles.

00:27.760 --> 00:33.200
Carmen Town is now in session. Let's bring out our Game Master Extrusionaire, Spencer Crittenden.

00:40.800 --> 00:46.880
Hello Spencer. What's up? What it is, man? I got the couch back. You're wearing, you got your

00:46.880 --> 00:54.960
couch, you're wearing your iconic Lumberjackie kind of classic wardrobe. Let's bring out your mayor,

00:54.960 --> 00:59.280
his name is Daniel Anastasia Harmon.

01:05.920 --> 01:06.400
Damn.

01:08.880 --> 01:15.120
Living in the city isn't easy for a child.

01:17.120 --> 01:22.720
Trying to reach the sunlight even though your spirit's wild.

01:22.720 --> 01:32.960
Living in the city should be, should be, pretty easy to reach sunlight if you're wild.

01:32.960 --> 01:40.480
Oh, I didn't know I had a note session with a fellow person singing a song.

01:40.480 --> 01:46.480
Living in the city feels trite. What does that even mean?

01:46.480 --> 01:54.000
It feels trite. That's just a thing that high school teachers write on your essays.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.600
Seven on a kitty. Damn. This feels overwrought.

01:59.600 --> 02:08.960
I'm seventeen. It's a creative writing class. I should be overwrought. I don't know how to

02:09.600 --> 02:12.160
take that note. It sounds like over ready.

02:12.160 --> 02:20.160
Hello, Dan. How's it going? Compared to these days, which I imagine you kids,

02:20.160 --> 02:25.360
you probably didn't have a school paper. You probably have a school text, a school emoji.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.720
Where you're like, we're going to send out the school emoji.

02:32.080 --> 02:38.960
You fucking robots. I'm not blaming you. I feel bad for you. I didn't make my school paper,

02:38.960 --> 02:43.440
but I had one, and we had deadlines. You didn't work on your school paper.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.720
I would assume that you would have been editor-in-chief of your school paper.

02:46.720 --> 02:52.800
Look, make no mistake. I was top shit in terms of creating the content. That's not true.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.640
No, there were better workers, harder workers, and there were people more respected. There were

02:58.640 --> 03:03.600
better poets. There were better writers. But I loved working on the school paper.

03:03.600 --> 03:10.320
I just wanted glory. I had a serialized Spencer. Hell, yes. This will wake you up.

03:10.320 --> 03:17.200
Serial? I'm awake. I'm just behind everyone else. A new way of saying hi.

03:21.040 --> 03:25.280
Didn't get that big a laugh. I'm not feeling good vibes tonight.

03:25.280 --> 03:33.120
I'm not laughing at them. It seemed like I was shaming you like I'm I'm proud of you being

03:33.120 --> 03:39.920
high. Oh yeah, me too. No, I'm loving it. I'm just not on my game. Love how high you are.

03:39.920 --> 03:46.480
Yeah, see proud of you son. Oh yeah. I was in Boston where I didn't smoke much every time I

03:46.480 --> 03:51.840
come back from a trip. That's the highest I've ever been. It's the best. Why are you in Boston?

03:51.840 --> 03:56.880
There's this thing called packs. I guess there's a bunch of them. There's once closer

03:56.880 --> 04:04.880
apparently, but I went to the one in Boston. You play games. Oh, you were were you DMing?

04:04.880 --> 04:11.840
No, no, I should have. If I had any forethought at all, it would have been insane. How is it

04:11.840 --> 04:17.440
packs compared to a Gen Con? I've never been to Gen Con. I want to do that too, but I don't know.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.800
It was just weird though. I've never been to anything because it was it was kind of like

04:20.800 --> 04:25.040
Comic Con just with a convention floor, you know, but then a good third of the space was just like

04:25.040 --> 04:30.080
long tables and chairs that were just full of people playing fucking board games and games and

04:30.080 --> 04:35.120
shit. It was crazy. There's so much game playing. I've just never seen. I mean, there's all these

04:35.120 --> 04:40.080
cons we've been on. It's like check out what's on Fox and then it's like the cosplay brigade

04:40.080 --> 04:44.000
or whatever, but it's like it's all this thing. You know, it's all just kind of like this weird

04:44.000 --> 04:51.200
artifice or marketing or whatever. But like, this is just people doing doing games. It was interesting.

04:51.200 --> 04:58.640
When I was your age, uh, uh, Ulysses S. Grant was president of the United States.

04:59.920 --> 05:05.680
Blood was fair enough. I remember Comic Con. We would go to Comic Con and it would be like

05:05.680 --> 05:10.160
because we were working in comic books and it would be like, oh, we're here to sign a comic book.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.480
And then you'd walk around and be like, God damn, this place has a lot of people selling comic books.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.560
Right. And then there was like also people are like, well, guys are walking around selling,

05:18.560 --> 05:24.080
buying comic books. Maybe you'd like a sword. And the answer is that's fair. Yeah. There was a

05:24.080 --> 05:27.920
dude. Lots of people want swords. There was a dude by comic books. It makes sense. In Inglewood,

05:27.920 --> 05:37.680
that was had a sword in a Scientology church and he got killed by police because I think he

05:37.680 --> 05:43.600
fucked up a couple of cops with a sword. Oh yeah. In a Scientology church. Is that what you called

05:43.600 --> 05:51.120
them? Uh-huh. And it's like Inglewood's fucked up for a lot of reasons, but uh, if you're gonna

05:51.120 --> 05:56.000
fucking have a sword thrown down, I like that it was a Scientology venue. Well, when you're,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.040
it's because, because you're able to just be objective and you don't have to root for either

05:59.040 --> 06:06.320
side. You're like, oh, I hope the police learned their lesson along with Zinu. I will, I will stab

06:06.320 --> 06:11.440
your Satan. I don't know how it works. You just heard the word sword. And like, I mean, I'm already

06:11.440 --> 06:16.000
three tangents deep, but I can't have you doing that. What? You're sober. I guess I can't. It's

06:16.000 --> 06:19.360
fine. There's no guest. There's no guest. This is it. This is the show. I brought it up. Well,

06:19.360 --> 06:24.160
what, it's okay. It's all right. It was a, it was a very spurious connection. I think. I was like,

06:24.160 --> 06:27.520
I was like, based on something Spencer was saying about this convention where it's like,

06:27.520 --> 06:32.080
oh, it's just people play games. And I was like, I remember from the old days, the early 90s,

06:32.080 --> 06:38.880
like 93, 95, like I remember being a comic con and like selling and buying comic books out of

06:38.880 --> 06:43.440
big boxes and everyone was just like, it's just comic con. And yeah, there was a ton of shit that

06:43.440 --> 06:48.240
wasn't comics. I'm not, I don't, I'm not going to like be an old timer that like pretends and,

06:48.240 --> 06:51.280
you know, there's nothing but comic books. I was like, no, it's a bunch of swords.

06:53.280 --> 06:58.080
And, and like, but, and then I, but I remember like when it was like that central area of the

06:58.080 --> 07:04.080
exhibit floor, like the day that it was like the PlayStation one, like, like kind of like, like,

07:04.080 --> 07:09.040
oh, what's the fuck is going on in the middle of this fucking, why the hell are we having to walk

07:09.040 --> 07:15.040
around this? I was like, well, some video game decided that because technically we're all nerds

07:15.680 --> 07:19.920
that maybe we'd be interested in Papa the Rapper, like, like, like coming out on

07:19.920 --> 07:23.200
fucking Xbox or something. And it was like, like it just started. And there was like,

07:23.200 --> 07:26.720
like along with that, it was like everyone's wrong. What was that Bruce Willis? What the

07:26.720 --> 07:31.280
fuck's going on? Yeah. Hey, and then, and then with that comes like that. Hey, stop sitting on

07:31.280 --> 07:38.880
the floor, fatty. Well, I got a bunch of comic books. Yeah, bet you do. You know who's got more

07:38.880 --> 07:43.760
comic books than you, Bruce Willis. You fucking sit in the floor in front of him. I'm gonna fucking

07:43.760 --> 07:49.120
mace your ass. Now that conversation never happened. Yeah, no, those guys, the guys are bad. Those

07:49.120 --> 07:53.600
staff guys at Comic Con are bad. At PAX, they were like volunteers and they were actually really

07:53.600 --> 08:00.000
good at their jobs. They were like very, like, like contextual with their enforcements. But

08:00.000 --> 08:07.360
just so that both sides are represented. I'm a big both sideist. Uh-oh. We were at WonderCon.

08:07.360 --> 08:12.560
That was a real like all the security there was volunteer, which is why a guy came up to talk

08:12.560 --> 08:17.520
about Deadpool and his friend came up to punch him in the face. And then we were paid in an

08:17.520 --> 08:22.880
envelope of cash and whisked back to the hotel. Those were bad. I will never go back to Florida

08:22.880 --> 08:29.600
again. If I want to know about Florida, I will watch Flocka videos. That was a show that I was

08:29.600 --> 08:35.920
not... You on that Flocka? Wow! Wow! I was not at that show. I wonder like how that would have

08:35.920 --> 08:41.760
gone down if I had interfered in that like interference loop. I bet you would have caught

08:41.760 --> 08:47.760
his punch. No, I wouldn't because I'm not a martial artist. No, you wouldn't. I just think

08:47.760 --> 08:50.960
I would have made the person feel bad before they started throwing punches at people.

08:50.960 --> 08:56.080
The guy who did not take a survey, like he... It was all very... It all happened very fast.

08:56.080 --> 09:02.480
The guy walked up and punched his friend in the face. The thing is, it looked like he

09:02.480 --> 09:08.720
was going to grab a mic until the very last second, which is a semi-precedent phenomenon,

09:08.720 --> 09:13.760
unfortunately. And he punched his friend. He's alleged friend. Well, we found out later that

09:13.760 --> 09:19.520
they were friends. Was that a setup? It may have been. What's the difference when you're 22?

09:19.520 --> 09:24.240
Everything's a joke. Nothing's a joke. Like everything's... You're Tyler Durden. You're

09:25.600 --> 09:28.400
Robert Edwards or whatever the Hulk's name is. You're...

09:29.920 --> 09:31.840
Bruce Bannon. It's not Robert Evans. Ed Norton.

09:34.560 --> 09:40.320
You're Robert Evans. You're kids in the picture. You're kids out of the picture.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.760
The kids of the Hulk. It doesn't matter to them. They're 22. What's the difference between life

09:45.760 --> 09:53.280
and death? You're 22. Here was what I did when I was 22. I spent five years doing nothing but

09:53.280 --> 10:01.200
smoking weed out of a bong I made out of a syrup bottle. It was fucking melted plastic I was smoking.

10:01.200 --> 10:07.360
Like I wasn't even smoking weed. I tested that theory. I was like, well, maybe it's just a placebo.

10:07.360 --> 10:16.400
Yeah, or you've been huffing fucking burnt plastic for five years. Like Cheryl Crowe thinks she got

10:16.400 --> 10:20.640
cancer from the water bottles in the backseat of her car. Like it's a real thing. Like the idea

10:20.640 --> 10:28.240
of just water soaking in plastic, let alone heated. This is why I can't remember Ed Norton's name.

10:29.760 --> 10:34.480
It's not Ed Norton. That's from Honeymooners. It's Robert Evans.

10:34.480 --> 10:42.720
Ed Norton is the Hulk. It's Bixby. Bixby is the Hulk. Well, come on. Bill Bixby played. Bill Bixby

10:42.720 --> 10:49.600
played the name of the character. Ed Norton. It's not Ed Norton. That's the actor of the

10:49.600 --> 10:56.400
new Hulk. He played the Hulk in one of the nine Hulk movies. The angry one where the Hulk appears on

10:56.400 --> 11:06.080
page 71. Wait, what? Wait, say what? Ed Norton made the punk rock response. He was like, yeah,

11:06.080 --> 11:12.080
no, come on. I'm not making that fucking shit. The Hulk speaks to me. It's about trying to manage

11:12.080 --> 11:20.080
your fucking anger. I'm not mocking him. It sounds a lot like I am. It was good. No, no.

11:20.080 --> 11:26.880
Mark Ruffalo, right? Mark Ruffalo. He bees the Hulk. No, no, no. Who was in the angry one?

11:27.920 --> 11:35.360
Eric Banna. Ang Lee, Eric Banna. Josh Whedon cracked the code. Like, don't make Hulk movies.

11:35.360 --> 11:40.960
Josh Whedon said, he's like, you can't make a Hulk movie. The Hulk is a Marvel character that

11:40.960 --> 11:45.040
hates the one thing the audience loves. Like, you can't. The Thor isn't like that. He's like,

11:45.040 --> 11:50.480
don't get that fucking hammer away from me. Unfortunately, the Hulk is just like the closest

11:50.480 --> 11:54.720
thing you're going to get to a DC character in the Marvel universe. You can do anything but

11:54.720 --> 12:00.400
doesn't want to. Who is the actor that played the 70s or 80s Hulk? Bill Bixby. Bill Bixby, yeah.

12:00.400 --> 12:06.160
Well, Lufrigna was the Hulk, but who? Bill Bixby was the non-Hulky version of that character.

12:06.160 --> 12:11.920
Fantastic. I wish, I really wish Bill Bixby, well, I mean, if he was, Bill Bixby is fucking great.

12:11.920 --> 12:16.000
Watch my favorite Martian, the young Bill Bixby. He'd Hulk out and his pants would fly off,

12:16.800 --> 12:21.840
and then all of a sudden he had a rope belt. Where did that rope come from? He had an endless

12:21.840 --> 12:25.520
supply of rope, but not an endless supply. It came from a satisfied audience in the Academy of

12:25.520 --> 12:32.960
Television Sciences because that show won an Emmy for Best Dramatic Series on television. The Hulk,

12:32.960 --> 12:36.800
where they would regularly, if they had to show a close-up of the Hulk's foot,

12:36.800 --> 12:43.680
mashing a gas pedal, as it sometimes did, because sometimes the Hulk did need to angrily drive a

12:43.680 --> 12:49.200
car. And they would show a close-up of his foot, and it would be Lufrigna's foot with a little

12:49.200 --> 12:54.880
green pantyhose on it, like a little, like a spandex. But also the pants were torn in a way

12:54.880 --> 13:01.040
that like a pirate's pants are torn. They weren't torn in regular, like, I, oh, my leg got three

13:01.040 --> 13:04.240
times bigger. They were torn in a weird department kind of way. But it was amazing, like they would

13:04.240 --> 13:09.760
show, I was watching a Hulk rerun and they showed like the Hulk went, and like jammed his foot.

13:09.760 --> 13:12.480
And you could tell, it's like, okay, so what are we going to cut to in the edit bay? And the answer

13:12.480 --> 13:16.480
is usually like a second unit. Like if you, you can bank this stuff, like they're like, well,

13:16.480 --> 13:21.520
yeah, we sent out the crew and we shot like one of the stunt guys or whatever, like we shot their

13:21.520 --> 13:25.280
foot going through the thing. And it was like the guys, like whoever it is, they're wearing like,

13:25.280 --> 13:28.720
they're wearing a thing that would make sense for them to wear instead of spray painting their feet

13:28.720 --> 13:32.000
green if they're doing like shots of them, like leaping over fences or whatever. But this, which

13:32.000 --> 13:36.560
is like they're wearing like a green sock on their foot. And it doesn't, it's not like, I mean in

13:36.560 --> 13:40.400
this world of CG, you don't even probably don't even understand what I'm really saying. Like it's

13:40.400 --> 13:47.360
just like green tights like on your foot, like, so there's no toes. And they do like a close-up of

13:47.360 --> 13:52.160
big, and it's like, editor was like, yeah, I'll use it. And the executive producer was like,

13:52.160 --> 13:55.680
what are you doing a sock commercial? And he's like, no, this is your show about the Hulk.

13:55.680 --> 14:02.880
And the EP was like, okay, well, what's it, what do we do after this? It goes into the Smithsonian.

14:02.880 --> 14:08.480
No, it goes on television for an hour. And like, oh, are you sure people aren't gonna, dude,

14:08.480 --> 14:13.840
there's no, what do you think people are gonna record it? People are gonna watch it over and

14:13.840 --> 14:19.280
over again. 75% of the human beings that love your show and gave you an Emmy are never gonna

14:19.280 --> 14:24.960
see that foot. They're gonna be making a sandwich. They're gonna be yelling at their daughter for

14:24.960 --> 14:33.360
joining the occult. The MRA. And like, none of them knew, the VCR hadn't been invented. So like,

14:33.360 --> 14:38.480
back then, it was just going out of the airwaves, which means it's like going, like, it's like

14:38.480 --> 14:48.800
pissing it out of your dick. But also, watching old TV on high-def television, like a great digital

14:48.800 --> 14:54.320
TV, changes everything. When it's remastered, like if they would shoot Night Rider on film,

14:54.320 --> 14:58.800
and then they would, and then it got broadcast, you know, that some of these old shows, like they

14:58.800 --> 15:03.760
shoot it on film and then, and then if they kept the shit or whatever, it's like they'll do like

15:03.760 --> 15:08.080
Night Rider on Blu-ray. You can like watch the thing and you're like, oh, now you're seeing

15:08.080 --> 15:12.480
shit that not only, but I'm just saying even, even before high-def where you're like, oh,

15:12.480 --> 15:16.480
they didn't know Wonder Woman's like wig would look like, you know, they didn't know we could see

15:16.480 --> 15:21.440
that makeup because they didn't have high-def. But I'm saying even like the, they also didn't

15:21.440 --> 15:28.000
understand the high-def that is we would all have all media permanently stored forever.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.200
Forever, yeah. It wasn't momentary. They were just like, well, what we do is we like throw

15:33.200 --> 15:38.880
these candies at a parade. And I'm not imputing them at all. They took great pride in it, but they

15:38.880 --> 15:43.760
thought that their job was like, they've spent more time going like, when you throw candy,

15:43.760 --> 15:48.400
don't hit a kid in the eye. Don't let them choke, you know, like don't throw it to a kid who looks

15:48.400 --> 15:52.880
like his epiglottis might be malformed. Like they, they were focused more on different shit

15:52.880 --> 15:56.560
because it was of the moment. And now we live in this world where it's like every candy is like

15:56.560 --> 16:01.200
beamed into their brain by Venmo and they have it forever. So keep in mind that five years from now

16:01.200 --> 16:07.840
you might be committing a felony. Do you remember when the Harlem Globetrotters made it to Gilligan's

16:07.840 --> 16:18.240
Island? Yeah, but they finally made it. But also, also fucking, also they got off the island. Like in

16:18.240 --> 16:25.120
the same episode. Everybody does. How come the cast can't be smarter than the Harlem Globetrotters

16:25.120 --> 16:32.080
and make a boat? These are, these are old questions, Jeff. Everybody wonders that. Let's do a segment

16:32.080 --> 16:38.640
called old TV questions. Oh yeah. Who's got an old TV question for me? Don't ask them.

16:39.600 --> 16:46.720
I have 800,000 questions about Fantasy Island. Yeah. Chris McKenna and I are obsessed. Like

16:46.720 --> 16:50.720
without having even really rewatched the show, Chris McKenna and I are from community are

16:50.720 --> 16:56.080
constantly talking about like doing our Fantasy Island reboot where, where you focus more on the

16:56.080 --> 16:59.840
people that work at Fantasy Island because it's like, what the fuck for those of you who don't

16:59.840 --> 17:03.360
know, you probably have heard the log. Like you're probably as familiar with it as I am,

17:03.360 --> 17:06.400
even though I grew up like with it actually on the air, but you probably because it's such a

17:06.400 --> 17:13.680
simple concept. It's Mr. Rourke, Ricardo Montalban, Montalban and his diminutive magical friend,

17:14.480 --> 17:20.400
Herve Villaches playing a guy named Tattoo. They both wear white suits and they work on this island

17:20.400 --> 17:25.600
and a plane comes down plane lands with three people or couples. And as they get off the plane,

17:25.600 --> 17:34.080
Mr. Tattoo goes, who's that boss? What about them? Ah, Tattoo. That is a famous author, J.K. Rowling.

17:35.520 --> 17:39.680
Sometimes it would be ripped from the headlines in that like subtle 70s way. Like that's a famous

17:39.680 --> 17:46.720
author, R.K. Fowling. You know, like, oh, I get it. Like the archetype of the famous author. And

17:46.720 --> 17:53.600
it's like, she's, oh God, she sold over 300,000 books. That's half the population of the earth.

17:53.600 --> 18:03.040
That's correct, Tattoo. But she's never experienced the gas shortage. No, I'm just trying to say it's

18:03.040 --> 18:10.640
like a 70s show. I don't know. Dan Harmon answers his own TV question. But like a massive bulk

18:10.640 --> 18:20.240
of the people that came to Fantasy Island, a huge percentage of the people that came to Fantasy

18:20.240 --> 18:26.640
Island were getting, you know, they all paid ostensibly, I would say, an exorbitant price.

18:26.640 --> 18:31.040
Otherwise, why isn't there a ship full of people? It's always a sea plane and people are getting

18:31.040 --> 18:37.760
off and they look rich and they're like always bestselling authors. And so they paid a hefty sum

18:37.760 --> 18:44.960
and then like a lot of them were like, like came there going, I want to be famous or I want to be

18:44.960 --> 18:51.040
a rock star or I want to be rich. I want to be respected. And like a bunch of them, if not all

18:51.040 --> 18:57.840
of them, like it was like, oh, okay, I guess that's kind of fucked up that you made me get chased by

18:57.840 --> 19:11.120
a dinosaur. But now that I think of it, I just needed confidence. Bye. Thank you. Fantasy fulfilled

19:11.120 --> 19:18.160
just not the one I paid for the one I needed. Can I have my money back? My memory is that they

19:18.160 --> 19:22.720
were always like, they accidentally found out they needed to fall in love with Orson Welles or

19:22.720 --> 19:28.320
somebody like they had to. I mean, all I remember as a kid is it was always like the only theme I

19:28.320 --> 19:33.360
remember concept was just sort of like, but I'm unhappy now. Yes, but that's the point. Oh, thank

19:33.360 --> 19:42.080
you. I could I could have sworn I could have gone to McDonald's with a thousand times less money

19:42.080 --> 19:48.400
than I gave you and gotten more opportunity to inspect myself. But would you have hung out with

19:48.400 --> 19:55.680
Stephanie? What's her name? Zimbalist? The cast of that show is always great. Well,

19:56.560 --> 20:00.240
but that's the only other thing about Fantasy Island is like the fascinating thing is that

20:00.240 --> 20:03.600
even though there's three couples that show up at the beginning of the episode,

20:05.120 --> 20:08.960
there's like there's always these establishing shots of like, oh, and then fantasy island

20:08.960 --> 20:14.080
business is going on. And there's like, you see like people, there's like waiters bringing

20:14.800 --> 20:19.680
coconut drinks to like people that are sitting by the side of the pool. And none of those people

20:19.680 --> 20:26.560
came in on a sea plane. I think they all did. I think they're all on a fantasy island. You think

20:26.560 --> 20:32.640
every time I mean that's like a rotation of sea planes. The camera focuses on Stephanie powers

20:32.640 --> 20:40.000
and like Robert something. I was assuming more that like you could also come to fantasy island

20:40.000 --> 20:46.240
on a huge shitty ferry from New Jersey or something and like pay $80 a weekend to like

20:46.240 --> 20:50.160
sit near rich people who were being taught that they shouldn't need shit as much.

20:50.160 --> 20:56.960
Like you're just like, give me another drink. Stop yelling. Hey, well, listen, Mr. Rourke

20:56.960 --> 21:02.560
ain't going to teach you to fucking quit lipping off. So because we didn't pay for the platinum

21:02.560 --> 21:08.480
package to just fucking do what I say and give me a napkin. I can't wait till we're rich enough

21:08.480 --> 21:13.840
to come to this island and and tattoo says who's that and Mr. Rourke says it's a guy who wishes

21:13.840 --> 21:19.520
his wife would shut up so that you get chased by a dinosaur. Yeah, well, I'm looking around and I

21:19.520 --> 21:31.920
ain't see a new dinosaurs. So shut your lip, Rebecca. Oh, it's a living. I was just in Atlantic

21:31.920 --> 21:38.160
City and you did a perfect impression of everybody every conversation. You just walk down the

21:38.160 --> 21:43.120
street and you see, oh, this looks like a lovely couple. And I was like, Oh, who's going to fuck

21:43.120 --> 21:50.240
me tonight? You fucking jamook. You fucking piece of shit. Stugatz. And there's the guy

21:50.960 --> 21:55.920
talking to the girl and the girl goes, Oh, who the fuck are you? You fucking and then they go,

21:55.920 --> 22:02.240
Oh, Jeff Davis, we love your show coming tonight. That's terrific. And then they come up on stage.

22:02.240 --> 22:07.920
The audience was drunker than the cast, which we find highly disrespectful.

22:07.920 --> 22:15.280
Holy fuck, Jersey audiences. I had it off to you because wow.

22:18.560 --> 22:23.360
The women smoke and talk like stevedores. It's really, it's amazing. I mean, that's hot.

22:26.400 --> 22:31.200
But that might be part of the Marissa Tomei, my cousin Vinnie Trope of like, like, I don't know,

22:31.200 --> 22:36.080
but I think I mean, I like, I like a dirty girl. I told you the story. Have I told the story?

22:36.080 --> 22:40.160
I don't like Princess Leia. I don't want to soil Princess Leia. I know I did my little disgusting

22:40.160 --> 22:44.880
misogynistic rant about Amy Grant, but that was my old 15 year old self. I was like, Oh, I want to,

22:46.240 --> 22:52.960
I have grown into a man that wants to be soiled. And I have found a partner that I feel, I always

22:52.960 --> 22:59.120
feel dirtier after I have sex with Cody. And that's why I am proud to give her my fucking.

22:59.120 --> 23:04.560
I'm never going to get an erection again after that.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.520
I have told the story about what the girl said that was trying to come on to Ryan in

23:10.880 --> 23:13.760
Morristown, New Jersey, right? I've told the story before, haven't I?

23:13.760 --> 23:17.600
I don't know. Audience have. Go for it. Just let her rip.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.760
All right. So we're at, we did a show in Morristown, New Jersey. It's very nice.

23:21.760 --> 23:28.720
And it's like the Mayo something. It's a fancy theater and across the street is a nice pub.

23:29.600 --> 23:34.160
We meet some... The Mayo theater sounds incredible. One of those fancy places, like the Mayo theater.

23:34.160 --> 23:38.800
No, like the Mayo Center. Like it's like an aristocratic kind of, you know,

23:38.800 --> 23:42.320
healthy occupational... A healthy... Asker Meyer auditorium.

23:42.320 --> 23:48.960
Yes. It was a miracle. And we are at this pub across the street and Ryan and I and Greg

23:48.960 --> 23:54.160
Proops and I think Chip Eston, we meet a gang of waitresses and they all say,

23:54.160 --> 23:56.720
hey, you guys got to come to this bar after we're done.

23:56.720 --> 24:00.720
You got to come to this fucking bar. No, no, no. They're currently working.

24:00.720 --> 24:03.520
They're wearing their working tops. So they can't cuss.

24:03.520 --> 24:06.640
They can't cuss. They're being very... Well, I think that's how people in Jersey dress.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.640
Huh? Well, go ahead. Get started.

24:09.840 --> 24:14.080
These are women that are wearing a bow tie and an apron and a thing at a club.

24:14.080 --> 24:19.040
We go to a club and it is... I will never forget that when we walked in,

24:19.040 --> 24:22.080
Ice Ice Baby was playing and people were line dancing to it.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.560
They were doing the electric slide to Ice Ice Baby.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.480
They're like, oh shit, it's fucking 1991 right now. It's great.

24:32.480 --> 24:39.520
And there was a giant transgender woman, I'll say, who looked like Mean Joe Green

24:39.520 --> 24:45.440
wearing a blue cocktail dress who like immediately fell in love with Ryan Stiles

24:45.440 --> 24:48.080
because he knew who he was. You're selling this place.

24:49.440 --> 24:52.960
If you go to Maristown, find this fucking place because it's great.

24:52.960 --> 24:58.240
Like it's just drywall. There's no... There's nothing. It's just a fucking nightmare.

24:58.240 --> 25:04.640
And we want to hide right now. Are we safe?

25:04.640 --> 25:07.040
Ryan Stiles is six foot six, I think.

25:07.040 --> 25:10.320
This guy is a head taller than him.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.440
The cocktail fella?

25:11.440 --> 25:14.960
He's just a person that's at the bar.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.240
Oh, okay. Different fella.

25:16.240 --> 25:21.680
And Ryan introduced me to him or her and said, hey, Jeff, have you met the little lady?

25:21.680 --> 25:26.000
Have you met the little lady? He died laughing. We all had a good time.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.040
And then we all went to another bar and then three girls followed us.

25:31.040 --> 25:35.680
One girl who was also like flat footed my height.

25:35.680 --> 25:41.120
I'm 6'4". She in the middle of the street just started making out with me.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.080
He's 6'2".

25:42.080 --> 25:43.040
This was unheralded.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.640
He's 6'4 on his toes.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.840
And I go, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:47.840 --> 25:51.680
And the other girl comes up to me that was coming on to Ryan,

25:51.680 --> 25:54.240
who is like the best looking of the trio.

25:54.240 --> 25:59.760
And she goes, Jeff, she goes, I want to make out with Ryan tonight.

25:59.760 --> 26:04.080
I go, you just told me that that guy right behind us is your fiance.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.080
You know that Ryan is married.

26:06.080 --> 26:10.080
And she goes, oh, you got to be single to fuck with you guys.

26:14.080 --> 26:18.080
All right. You found my, I don't want to go there anymore.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.080
I don't like, I don't like...

26:20.080 --> 26:22.080
New Jersey is fucking insane.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.080
It's a crazy place made of crazy people.

26:24.080 --> 26:30.080
When I got to Boston, like within like two hours of being there,

26:30.080 --> 26:32.080
I got to my hotel and then I left my hotel to get dinner

26:32.080 --> 26:34.080
and just walking to a restaurant.

26:34.080 --> 26:40.080
I heard two separate people just like call other people the F word for a gaisler.

26:40.080 --> 26:44.080
And I was like, wow, this is just, yeah, this is Boston. Okay.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.080
Like the two syllable version?

26:46.080 --> 26:50.080
Yeah, yeah. It was, I was like, wow, this is, it was great.

26:50.080 --> 26:54.080
I mean, not great, you know, it was Boston as fuck.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.080
Boston.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.080
Simpler times.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.080
I was, I was in...

27:00.080 --> 27:02.080
I was in Vegas yesterday.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.080
I was in Las Vegas.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.080
Did someone say Thursday?

27:06.080 --> 27:08.080
Yeah, that's what happened.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.080
You said it. Simpler times Thursday.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.080
Yeah, in Boston.

27:12.080 --> 27:16.080
I was walking behind two cats at a place in Vegas yesterday

27:16.080 --> 27:20.080
and the guy goes, I'm pretty sure Philadelphia accent.

27:20.080 --> 27:24.080
I can't do a great Philadelphia accent, but I guarantee.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.080
Which borough?

27:26.080 --> 27:28.080
You heard me. Which side of the 10105?

27:28.080 --> 27:30.080
Yeah, it's by the fucking thing.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.080
What the fuck are you want to talk about?

27:32.080 --> 27:34.080
Who am I? The fucking guy?

27:34.080 --> 27:36.080
Like a West, a West Lisbon.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.080
It's by Permanis and you got to get it off your chest.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.080
It's by Permanis.

27:40.080 --> 27:44.080
But a guy in front of me wearing a tank top

27:44.080 --> 27:48.080
on a Saturday afternoon, as you do in Vegas,

27:48.080 --> 27:52.080
if you are determined to never get late.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.080
Sandals and tank tops.

27:54.080 --> 27:58.080
One guy in a tank top with a backwards baseball cap

27:58.080 --> 28:00.080
says to the other guy in a tank top

28:00.080 --> 28:02.080
what I think with a forward baseball cap.

28:02.080 --> 28:06.080
He goes, you fucking motherfucker.

28:06.080 --> 28:08.080
I was up 12 grand.

28:08.080 --> 28:12.080
I'm down 12 grand now, you fucking motherfucker.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.080
I'm fucking down 12 grand.

28:14.080 --> 28:18.080
But you should have fucking walked away.

28:18.080 --> 28:22.080
There's children walking by them.

28:22.080 --> 28:26.080
The beauty of Vegas is that nobody has any fucking heldry

28:26.080 --> 28:28.080
and fucking bull.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.080
Well, that's how those guys learned.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.080
But also, I like the fact that that guy had 12 grand

28:32.080 --> 28:34.080
to throw around.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.080
It's not like if you keep those kids out of that place

28:36.080 --> 28:38.080
they all turn into neurophysicists.

28:38.080 --> 28:42.080
They basically end up 85% of them back there going

28:42.080 --> 28:44.080
hey, oh, wait.

28:44.080 --> 28:48.080
I hate all of you.

28:48.080 --> 28:51.080
If you're down 12 grand and you're wearing a tank top,

28:51.080 --> 28:54.080
that's your fault.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.080
Yeah, because it's a choice you make.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.080
I'm saying I'm adding the added cynicism

28:58.080 --> 29:00.080
that you can't save those kids.

29:00.080 --> 29:03.080
Most of them turn out to be fucking idiots.

29:03.080 --> 29:07.080
You could raise them in a fucking under a rockin' at NASA.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.080
I guess that's dangerous.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.080
Where's the smartest place you could raise a kid?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.080
Where's a kid surrounded?

29:14.080 --> 29:17.080
Under underneath a giant rocket.

29:17.080 --> 29:19.080
I already said that's not a good place.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.080
Dummy.

29:21.080 --> 29:26.080
You fucking Stugots.

29:26.080 --> 29:31.080
Anyways, what I was going to say to you was

29:31.080 --> 29:34.080
that, god damn it, now I lost it again.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.080
Oh, no.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.080
It was, wait, shit, shit, shit, shit, fuck, fuck, fuck.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.080
We're almost there.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.080
God damn it, god damn it.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.080
It's coming around.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.080
You're going to get it.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.080
This is about Boston.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.080
You're going to get it.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.080
It wasn't Boston.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.080
No, no, no, no.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.080
Way, way back.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.080
Way back.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.080
Memory.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.080
Maybe a beat will bring it around for you.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.080
Talk it.

29:53.080 --> 29:56.080
Try to think about the thoughts in your head.

29:56.080 --> 29:59.080
Try to visualize a warehouse instead.

29:59.080 --> 30:03.080
Like the Dreamcatcher movie when they went through the halls

30:03.080 --> 30:10.080
so that you could understand it all about the concept of memory.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.080
So you guys see Dreamcatcher?

30:13.080 --> 30:14.080
All right, stop.

30:14.080 --> 30:17.080
I just got bummed out.

30:17.080 --> 30:22.080
A character in the movie Dreamcatcher, Stephen King's Dreamcatcher,

30:22.080 --> 30:25.080
and they're like, oh, man.

30:25.080 --> 30:28.080
It's a nine-hour mini-series event.

30:28.080 --> 30:33.080
They couldn't figure out what to remove from this tome.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.080
It's just adapted.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.080
People need to see it.

30:36.080 --> 30:38.080
It's words coming out of a typewriter.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.080
What do we do?

30:39.080 --> 30:40.080
We got to commit it to film.

30:40.080 --> 30:43.080
If the book says they did this, they got to do that.

30:43.080 --> 30:46.080
If the book was 300 pages, then the script's going to be 900 pages.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.080
If that means that the thing's going to be 10 hours long,

30:49.080 --> 30:50.080
then we can't put it in a theater.

30:50.080 --> 30:53.080
No theater will fit.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.080
Release it on television.

30:54.080 --> 30:57.080
There, I said it.

30:57.080 --> 31:05.080
OK, so Dreamcatcher is like a 900-page script for a 10-hour event

31:05.080 --> 31:11.080
about a group of grown-ups who get this in their childhood

31:11.080 --> 31:16.080
used to experience magical things that were scary,

31:16.080 --> 31:20.080
that taught them that they were special in amorphous ways.

31:20.080 --> 31:24.080
So then in adulthood, they get together and the ay-ya-yi-ya-yi

31:24.080 --> 31:29.080
find your backspace key.

31:29.080 --> 31:32.080
There, I said it.

31:32.080 --> 31:36.080
I got drunk enough.

31:36.080 --> 31:38.080
I wouldn't do anything.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.080
You know why?

31:39.080 --> 31:44.080
I have enough integrity that I don't ever write anything.

31:44.080 --> 31:48.080
My fingers tremble with the responsibility above the keys

31:48.080 --> 31:51.080
because I'm no hack.

31:51.080 --> 31:56.080
I would never finish Monster House.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.080
I would have spent another 20 years.

31:59.080 --> 32:04.080
You would never know how that house would stop being a monster.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.080
I never would have told you how it started.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.080
Why did the house become a monster?

32:08.080 --> 32:12.080
The lady at a circus didn't get loved enough.

32:12.080 --> 32:15.080
They finished that for me.

32:15.080 --> 32:21.080
As far as I understood it,

32:21.080 --> 32:23.080
the point of the movie was supposed to be,

32:23.080 --> 32:25.080
don't ask those questions.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.080
They go to the library and they pull out a book

32:27.080 --> 32:29.080
and it's supposed to be like,

32:29.080 --> 32:31.080
Schrabs pitched it and I was like, that's great.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.080
Let's just do it this way.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.080
They go to the library and they pull out a book

32:35.080 --> 32:38.080
and there's a page and it's like Abe Lincoln's fighting a monster log cabin

32:38.080 --> 32:40.080
with a coal shovel.

32:40.080 --> 32:43.080
They're like, this has been happening since the beginning of time.

32:43.080 --> 32:45.080
There's a word for this kind of demon.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.080
It's like a property demon.

32:47.080 --> 32:51.080
If you die coveting your property a certain amount,

32:51.080 --> 32:54.080
there's like a monster pyramid biting in Egyptian.

32:54.080 --> 32:56.080
It's like, if you...

32:56.080 --> 33:00.080
Fuck it, make monster pyramid.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.080
That's a fucking, that's your movie.

33:02.080 --> 33:06.080
What if they had let me finish that beautiful script?

33:06.080 --> 33:09.080
I would be on my third draft by now,

33:09.080 --> 33:12.080
but no, they dragged it out of me.

33:12.080 --> 33:15.080
Monster pyramid, I want to fucking see that immediately.

33:15.080 --> 33:20.080
But you're not supposed to then go find out that,

33:20.080 --> 33:23.080
oh, on top of that there's another reason why the house is a monster

33:23.080 --> 33:26.080
and it's not what you thought, it's because of body shaming.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.080
I'm fine with that too,

33:28.080 --> 33:31.080
but it's like I would have removed the time life book

33:31.080 --> 33:33.080
and I would have like, you know,

33:33.080 --> 33:36.080
but you know, I would have not written it is my point.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.080
Here I am, 46 years old,

33:38.080 --> 33:41.080
like what am I trying to convince you kids of?

33:41.080 --> 33:46.080
The mythology of the auteur, it's garbage.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.080
Like what am I? I'm a piece of shit.

33:48.080 --> 33:52.080
I'm a terrible, like I'm a scarecrow, a living scarecrow.

33:52.080 --> 33:55.080
I should be a cautionary tale to you.

33:55.080 --> 33:59.080
Don't let the crows of your ambition land in my corn.

33:59.080 --> 34:08.080
You should see me crucified by my own self-imposed paralysis.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.080
That was a lot of redundancy and I would have refined that,

34:11.080 --> 34:13.080
but I don't have a backspace key in the podcast.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.080
It's like I wouldn't have written this scene.

34:15.080 --> 34:16.080
Hit the backspace.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.080
Okay, let's move on to something else.

34:18.080 --> 34:20.080
So it was the fucking...

34:20.080 --> 34:21.080
Yeah.

34:21.080 --> 34:22.080
God damn it.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.080
Thank you.

34:23.080 --> 34:26.080
I was talking about, what did I talk about when I first came out?

34:26.080 --> 34:30.080
No, that was me. What did you talk about?

34:30.080 --> 34:31.080
Go back.

34:31.080 --> 34:32.080
Right.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.080
Because you would just say, Fort?

34:34.080 --> 34:35.080
School papers.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.080
School papers. Ah, yes.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.080
Yes.

34:37.080 --> 34:38.080
Thanks.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.080
Good job, guys.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.080
Thank you.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.080
We did it.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.080
We worked as a team.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.080
Teamwork makes the dream work.

34:44.080 --> 34:47.080
This podcast is going to be all right.

34:47.080 --> 34:52.080
I just wanted to let you know that on my school paper,

34:52.080 --> 34:59.080
I wrote, I tried to write a serialized medieval fantasy piece.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.080
Yeah, that's awesome.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.080
That was going to be this epic thing.

35:02.080 --> 35:05.080
It was called The Legend of Falstaff or something.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.080
Uh-huh.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.080
And I was like, I think I wrote like two installments

35:08.080 --> 35:09.080
and just like walked away from it.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.080
Yeah.

35:10.080 --> 35:13.080
Because I was like, this is so long and rambling.

35:13.080 --> 35:16.080
I don't want to do this anymore.

35:16.080 --> 35:21.080
My friend used to just do like fraudulent articles in his school newspaper

35:21.080 --> 35:25.080
and it would just be all like, there's a new Coke in the Pepsi machine

35:25.080 --> 35:28.080
because Russia is trying to initiate a new Red Scare

35:28.080 --> 35:29.080
or something like that.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.080
Yeah.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.080
He's ahead of his time.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.080
Yeah.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.080
And that guy's name?

35:34.080 --> 35:36.080
Reince Priebus.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.080
Thank you.

35:37.080 --> 35:39.080
I got one big laugh from a dude.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.080
It's a funny name.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.080
That guy loves the Priebus.

35:43.080 --> 35:48.080
You laughed harder than I hoped anybody would.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.080
I don't know how you pronounce it.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.080
You pronounce Priebus' first name.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.080
I think it's Reince.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.080
Reince.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.080
Reince.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.080
Reince.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.080
Reince.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.080
I like that you were kind of like,

35:58.080 --> 36:00.080
that was like after 9-11 when my grandma was like,

36:00.080 --> 36:04.080
what's up with that bin laden?

36:04.080 --> 36:08.080
Like you haven't heard bin laden's name said by anyone?

36:08.080 --> 36:11.080
Like that old person like impulsed

36:11.080 --> 36:14.080
like I'm not going to fucking say the vowels of their name, right?

36:14.080 --> 36:16.080
The fuck have they done for me?

36:16.080 --> 36:17.080
Bin laden.

36:17.080 --> 36:20.080
You still say baggle, instead of baggle.

36:20.080 --> 36:24.080
Yeah, that's not because I fucking wish baggles would burn in hell

36:24.080 --> 36:25.080
because they fucking inged...

36:25.080 --> 36:28.080
But you've heard the word baggle more than you said it.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.080
You certainly must have heard the word baggle more

36:30.080 --> 36:31.080
than you've pronounced the word baggle.

36:31.080 --> 36:33.080
My fucking grandma just learned the word

36:33.080 --> 36:34.080
the same time everyone else did.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.080
She's watching the towers go down.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.080
She sees bin laden.

36:37.080 --> 36:40.080
Wolf Blitzer says bin laden.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.080
What the...

36:41.080 --> 36:43.080
You telling me my fucking grandma doesn't have the option?

36:43.080 --> 36:44.080
She's dead now.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.080
Are you happy?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.080
I am.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.080
How is that comparable?

36:47.080 --> 36:52.080
I'm talking about you not saying baggle.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.080
Yeah, I know.

36:53.080 --> 36:56.080
It's crazy that you're drawing that parallel.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.080
It's crazy.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.080
It's crazy.

36:59.080 --> 37:04.080
You can't say baggle.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.080
I try not to.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.080
I don't know what people are talking about.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.080
Baggle.

37:09.080 --> 37:12.080
It's spelled like a fucking bag.

37:12.080 --> 37:17.080
At this point in my life, I've tried to own it.

37:17.080 --> 37:19.080
I've tried to celebrate it.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.080
I've tried to fucking fix it.

37:21.080 --> 37:24.080
You people are ridiculous.

37:24.080 --> 37:27.080
You people are ridiculous.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.080
I'll apparently, every once in a while, by the way,

37:29.080 --> 37:32.080
apparently I'll accidentally say baggle.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.080
Baggle.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.080
You have to act like you're going to eat one.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.080
Baggle.

37:36.080 --> 37:39.080
Apparently I'll accidentally do that sometimes

37:39.080 --> 37:41.080
because when I do,

37:41.080 --> 37:44.080
that's where the shit really flies.

37:44.080 --> 37:47.080
It's like the time I combed my hair in seventh grade.

37:47.080 --> 37:49.080
Never again.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.080
Whoa, dude, dude, whoa.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.080
You combed your hair.

37:53.080 --> 37:56.080
Yeah, like on accident.

37:56.080 --> 38:00.080
Because believe me, I'm not taking fucking notes from you.

38:00.080 --> 38:04.080
You fucking immaculate piece of shit.

38:04.080 --> 38:09.080
You horrible precursor to 30 years of suffering

38:09.080 --> 38:11.080
that will culminate in it being unfashionable

38:11.080 --> 38:15.080
for me to be a victim?

38:15.080 --> 38:20.080
Have you ever thought about how it feels?

38:20.080 --> 38:23.080
For my career to culminate right when old white men

38:23.080 --> 38:26.080
aren't fun anymore?

38:26.080 --> 38:31.080
Think about, what did you think about me for a second?

38:31.080 --> 38:34.080
It's high time the white men had a platform.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.080
Yeah.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.080
Well, it's a high time we kept it.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.080
I guess it's what I just got here.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.080
I just got on that platform.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.080
I clambered up it.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.080
I felt like a woman.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.080
I had to work so hard.

38:48.080 --> 38:50.080
I don't even know what it's like to be white,

38:50.080 --> 38:52.080
but it can't be any different.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.080
I'm going to explain it all.

38:54.080 --> 38:57.080
What do you mean you don't want to hear from me?

38:57.080 --> 38:58.080
Where are you going?

38:58.080 --> 39:02.080
Come back.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.080
All right, I'll just buy this house over here.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.080
Hey, did you make a sketch where you fucked a baby?

39:06.080 --> 39:08.080
No, it wasn't a real baby.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.080
But you never heard the word bagel?

39:10.080 --> 39:12.080
God damn it!

39:12.080 --> 39:14.080
I only ever saw it in print.

39:14.080 --> 39:19.080
I didn't grow up in a fucking fancy house like yours.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.080
Ham and rules.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.080
I know how to pronounce ham and rules.

39:23.080 --> 39:26.080
You fucking debutant.

39:26.080 --> 39:29.080
Are you saying that you were so deep into Wisconsin

39:29.080 --> 39:31.080
that there was no bagel shops around?

39:31.080 --> 39:34.080
We had bagels, but they were fucking...

39:34.080 --> 39:36.080
It's not a regional thing, okay?

39:36.080 --> 39:39.080
I grew up fucking poor, and I was like...

39:39.080 --> 39:40.080
No, you fucking didn't.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.080
Yeah, I did.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.080
No, you didn't.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.080
Prove I didn't.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.080
Oh, shit.

39:45.080 --> 39:49.080
Show us the tax returns.

39:49.080 --> 39:50.080
I grew up so poor.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.080
Wait, I mean...

39:51.080 --> 39:53.080
How poor were you?

39:53.080 --> 39:58.080
My Tonka trucks were tonsil trucks.

39:58.080 --> 40:01.080
They were removed tonsils from privileged kids

40:01.080 --> 40:03.080
who could have their tonsils removed.

40:03.080 --> 40:05.080
My tonsils rotted in the back of my throat,

40:05.080 --> 40:07.080
and I had to swallow them and donate my shit

40:07.080 --> 40:10.080
to the coal company that my dad worked for.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.080
Also, I heard you were pretty poor.

40:12.080 --> 40:15.080
How poor was he?

40:15.080 --> 40:18.080
I just told you, and I'm like a really reliable metric.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.080
No, do another one.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.080
Top five.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.080
How poor was Dan Harmon growing up?

40:22.080 --> 40:26.080
When I got...

40:26.080 --> 40:29.080
What'd you do with paper plates?

40:29.080 --> 40:31.080
Probably something funny.

40:31.080 --> 40:34.080
No, you can't.

40:34.080 --> 40:37.080
Dan was so poor, his uncle died

40:37.080 --> 40:39.080
and came back as a hillbilly,

40:39.080 --> 40:45.080
and the doctor called it a case of re-intarnation.

40:45.080 --> 40:48.080
That's so fucking poor.

40:48.080 --> 40:51.080
That's how poor Dan's family was.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.080
Re-incarnation.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.080
Wow.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.080
Your family's so poor that they taught you

40:56.080 --> 41:00.080
how to stretch a premise connection.

41:00.080 --> 41:03.080
A bartender told me that joke in Sacramento

41:03.080 --> 41:05.080
four days ago, and I think,

41:05.080 --> 41:07.080
Here's how poor you are.

41:07.080 --> 41:11.080
Two guys walked into a bar.

41:11.080 --> 41:13.080
My least-in-locks were real locks there.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.080
That's the one I had in the chamber.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.080
Now listen, we got a lot of stuff to talk about.

41:17.080 --> 41:21.080
Do you know the difference between...

41:21.080 --> 41:26.080
Dale Earnhardt and Pink Floyd have in common?

41:26.080 --> 41:29.080
Both of their last hits was The Wall.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.080
Oh.

41:32.080 --> 41:33.080
That's crass.

41:33.080 --> 41:34.080
That's wildling humor.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.080
No heraldry.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.080
That's not a wildling joke.

41:36.080 --> 41:37.080
There's no heraldry anymore.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.080
That's a fucking good joke.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.080
No heraldry.

41:40.080 --> 41:43.080
Maybe if the Lannisters bullied you for your whole life

41:43.080 --> 41:46.080
and you were thrown to the wolves

41:46.080 --> 41:48.080
and then you were raised by white walkers,

41:48.080 --> 41:50.080
but you fight them enough for them to respect you,

41:50.080 --> 41:53.080
and then you were a redhead whittling in a cave.

41:53.080 --> 41:55.080
Maybe I'd let you laugh at that.

41:55.080 --> 41:58.080
If you were like that one...

41:58.080 --> 42:00.080
What was your name?

42:00.080 --> 42:01.080
Team Cersei.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.080
I'm Team Cersei.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.080
Team Cersei?

42:03.080 --> 42:06.080
What about those sleeves, honey?

42:06.080 --> 42:08.080
I don't know whether to...

42:08.080 --> 42:10.080
Where are this or...

42:10.080 --> 42:12.080
What is it, a slanket?

42:12.080 --> 42:16.080
All right.

42:16.080 --> 42:19.080
I appreciate you guys being here.

42:19.080 --> 42:23.080
Dan, do you know why Joseph Stalin

42:23.080 --> 42:25.080
only wrote in lowercase letters?

42:25.080 --> 42:28.080
Wait, why always...

42:28.080 --> 42:31.080
I hated capitalism.

42:31.080 --> 42:37.080
Do you know why ducks have tail feathers?

42:37.080 --> 42:42.080
To protect their capitalism.

42:42.080 --> 42:46.080
Because they hate capitalism.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.080
Why?

42:47.080 --> 42:50.080
It's to protect their butt quacks.

42:50.080 --> 42:52.080
Butt quacks?

42:52.080 --> 42:55.080
Because they're ducks, Dan.

42:55.080 --> 42:58.080
They also have regular assholes.

42:58.080 --> 43:00.080
Have a little glee in your life.

43:00.080 --> 43:03.080
Learn how to be a child again.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.080
That's just willful absurdity.

43:05.080 --> 43:07.080
That's not childhood innocence.

43:07.080 --> 43:10.080
Butt quacks, they also have butt cracks.

43:10.080 --> 43:12.080
They have tail feathers.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.080
But they don't have butt cracks.

43:14.080 --> 43:16.080
They have butt quacks because they're ducks.

43:16.080 --> 43:19.080
Then say what do ducks go to the proctologists

43:19.080 --> 43:21.080
to have inspected?

43:21.080 --> 43:23.080
Let me answer.

43:23.080 --> 43:25.080
Ask me.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.080
Yes, what?

43:27.080 --> 43:29.080
Butt quacks.

43:29.080 --> 43:31.080
What's the difference between what I did and what you did?

43:31.080 --> 43:35.080
Mine is more efficient.

43:35.080 --> 43:39.080
Mine is nature saying that God gave them tail feathers

43:39.080 --> 43:41.080
to protect their butt quacks.

43:41.080 --> 43:47.080
So they don't have to go to seek medical attention.

43:47.080 --> 43:50.080
Jeff, do you comb your butt?

43:50.080 --> 43:53.080
I don't.

43:53.080 --> 43:57.080
Then why do you have a part in the middle?

43:57.080 --> 44:01.080
Do you know why the toilet paper could not cross the road?

44:01.080 --> 44:04.080
It tee peas.

44:04.080 --> 44:07.080
It got stuck in a crack.

44:13.080 --> 44:15.080
Yeah, I mean, that works.

44:15.080 --> 44:18.080
By the way, for the record, I approve of that kind of wordplay.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.080
I don't laugh at it.

44:20.080 --> 44:22.080
But I'm like, okay, that scans, I'm fine.

44:22.080 --> 44:25.080
The butt quack thing, I'm not going to, whatever.

44:25.080 --> 44:30.080
Dan, a friend of mine just got a job as a security guard.

44:30.080 --> 44:35.080
And his boss told him, you got to watch the office.

44:35.080 --> 44:40.080
And he's on season three right now.

44:40.080 --> 44:42.080
He loves it.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.080
He hates it, but he loves it.

44:44.080 --> 44:48.080
He's just mad it wasn't community.

44:48.080 --> 44:50.080
I don't think so.

44:50.080 --> 44:53.080
Not that we, I mean, this steam train's steaming,

44:53.080 --> 44:57.080
but like, I was going to...

44:57.080 --> 45:00.080
I dropped a suit off of the dry cleaners.

45:00.080 --> 45:03.080
Okay, well let me, let's just make this a segment

45:03.080 --> 45:05.080
so I can sit down for it.

45:05.080 --> 45:06.080
I feel like...

45:06.080 --> 45:08.080
Press the button.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.080
Well, I tried.

45:10.080 --> 45:13.080
Jeff's joke corner.

45:13.080 --> 45:16.080
Jeff's joke corner.

45:16.080 --> 45:19.080
Jeff's joke corner.

45:19.080 --> 45:21.080
This is not a joke.

45:21.080 --> 45:26.080
This is an actual slice of life daily Jeff Davis kind of information.

45:26.080 --> 45:28.080
I got one of those, too.

45:28.080 --> 45:31.080
There's a white nationalist in the Oval Office.

45:31.080 --> 45:33.080
I could use a joke.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.080
Jeff's joke corner.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.080
All right, Spencer, you got one?

45:37.080 --> 45:39.080
What did the hot dog say to the sausage?

45:39.080 --> 45:41.080
No, no, yours is going to be better.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.080
Well, that's why I want you to go first.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.080
Oh, no.

45:44.080 --> 45:46.080
Okay, so I was driving down the road.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.080
What was it?

45:47.080 --> 45:52.080
The five north towards Sun Valley, right?

45:52.080 --> 45:57.080
And I see an ambulance and it's going buck wild

45:57.080 --> 46:01.080
and the back opens up and this ice chest flies out.

46:01.080 --> 46:02.080
And so I pull over.

46:02.080 --> 46:03.080
Wait, this really happened?

46:03.080 --> 46:04.080
Oh, yeah.

46:04.080 --> 46:09.080
And so I pull over and I get it and there's a human toe inside.

46:09.080 --> 46:10.080
Okay.

46:10.080 --> 46:11.080
Yeah.

46:11.080 --> 46:12.080
So I called the tow truck.

46:12.080 --> 46:13.080
Yes.

46:13.080 --> 46:14.080
Yeah.

46:14.080 --> 46:17.080
Jeff's joke corner.

46:17.080 --> 46:19.080
Jeff's joke corner.

46:19.080 --> 46:21.080
Okay, I don't know how to.

46:21.080 --> 46:26.080
I'm familiar with a set of circumstances also related to the medical community

46:26.080 --> 46:29.080
that surround a set of circumstances.

46:29.080 --> 46:31.080
Buckle up, everybody.

46:31.080 --> 46:34.080
But I don't know the wording right because it seems to me

46:34.080 --> 46:36.080
that the only way to tell the joke is to repeat the same word

46:36.080 --> 46:37.080
in the setup as in the punchline.

46:37.080 --> 46:39.080
That's the part I can't figure out.

46:39.080 --> 46:40.080
That's what's tricky.

46:40.080 --> 46:43.080
I'm going to construct it in a way that doesn't require that.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.080
Yes, that's the hard part.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.080
Just shoot from the hip.

46:45.080 --> 46:46.080
No, no, no, no, no.

46:46.080 --> 46:47.080
I'm going to.

46:47.080 --> 46:48.080
Spray and pray, baby.

46:48.080 --> 46:53.080
There's a guy went into the doctor and this just happened.

46:53.080 --> 46:57.080
And the doctor said, hello.

46:57.080 --> 46:58.080
How can I help you?

46:58.080 --> 47:02.080
And the guy was like, well, I don't know.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.080
How do I start?

47:03.080 --> 47:05.080
Like, should you shrink me down?

47:05.080 --> 47:08.080
And the doctor's like, what?

47:08.080 --> 47:12.080
Well, this is not a conversation I ever have in here.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.080
We don't have that kind of technology.

47:14.080 --> 47:17.080
And the guy's like, well, what do you have, like, a large bottle

47:17.080 --> 47:19.080
that I fit in?

47:19.080 --> 47:21.080
And the doctor's like, well, sir, please.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.080
We could go on like this forever.

47:23.080 --> 47:25.080
But just explain to me what's going on.

47:25.080 --> 47:29.080
He's like, I saw this sign outside your building.

47:29.080 --> 47:35.080
It said, vitamin B1.

47:35.080 --> 47:39.080
Yeah, Jess Joe Karner.

47:39.080 --> 47:42.080
Jess Joe Karner.

47:42.080 --> 47:46.080
I'm really, I'm going to listen to a playback of the sound you guys

47:46.080 --> 47:48.080
just finished making.

47:48.080 --> 47:50.080
Because there was a lot of victory in it.

47:50.080 --> 47:52.080
Like, I kind of thought it was like a rolling thunder.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.080
It was good.

47:53.080 --> 47:55.080
It was kind of like just uncomfortable.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.080
Oh, yeah.

47:56.080 --> 48:01.080
But part of it was that I like invited you into a kind of a magical world.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.080
They were ready.

48:02.080 --> 48:05.080
Like, it wasn't like, oh, you suck to telling the joke,

48:05.080 --> 48:08.080
or that guy's dumb for wanting to be a vitamin.

48:08.080 --> 48:10.080
I do have a lot of questions about him, too.

48:10.080 --> 48:12.080
You were like, oh, fuck.

48:12.080 --> 48:13.080
What kind of world is this?

48:13.080 --> 48:15.080
This guy wants to be a vitamin that bad?

48:15.080 --> 48:16.080
Just because a sign told him?

48:16.080 --> 48:17.080
He wanted to be a vitamin.

48:17.080 --> 48:19.080
Like, what if he passed a sign that was like,

48:19.080 --> 48:22.080
I mean, who knows what that guy could have read that day?

48:22.080 --> 48:25.080
He's even, he's gotten to the point in his head

48:25.080 --> 48:28.080
where he's interpreting letters as verbs.

48:28.080 --> 48:30.080
Like, it's just B1.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.080
And he's like, I got it.

48:31.080 --> 48:34.080
You didn't want to waste time on that sign.

48:34.080 --> 48:36.080
I'll go ask the doctor how to shrink me.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.080
Because in the original joke, it's like the guy says,

48:38.080 --> 48:40.080
I want to be a vitamin.

48:40.080 --> 48:41.080
That's not a real joke.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.080
You can't say that.

48:42.080 --> 48:44.080
The guy says, I want to be a vitamin.

48:44.080 --> 48:45.080
And the doctor says, why?

48:45.080 --> 48:48.080
And the guy says, because the sign said vitamin B1.

48:48.080 --> 48:49.080
Well, the doctor would be like, well,

48:49.080 --> 48:52.080
you can't use the word vitamin and B in your fucking setup.

48:52.080 --> 48:55.080
And the guy would be like, I'm not a joke.

48:55.080 --> 48:58.080
The doctor would be like, well, then you're just a psychopath.

48:58.080 --> 48:59.080
You're dangerous.

48:59.080 --> 49:03.080
Like Sirhan, Sirhan had more going on.

49:03.080 --> 49:07.080
And he shot a Kennedy.

49:07.080 --> 49:09.080
And the guy's like, who's that?

49:09.080 --> 49:11.080
There's jokes from the 50s.

49:11.080 --> 49:14.080
Like vitamin B1 signs were so new that people were like,

49:14.080 --> 49:17.080
what if this happened?

49:17.080 --> 49:18.080
People were so scared.

49:18.080 --> 49:22.080
Vitamin advertisements were going to undermine the fabric.

49:22.080 --> 49:24.080
They're like, hey, did you hear about that guy?

49:24.080 --> 49:26.080
Someone's going to see that sign and walk right in there

49:26.080 --> 49:29.080
and try to turn into a vitamin.

49:29.080 --> 49:32.080
That was their definition of problems.

49:32.080 --> 49:35.080
They reflected growing tensions of abbreviations at the time.

49:35.080 --> 49:39.080
And then they went to Woodstock and they just fucked the planet.

49:39.080 --> 49:41.080
They were like, oh, peace, love.

49:41.080 --> 49:42.080
Fuck this.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.080
What if this is a polar ice cap?

49:43.080 --> 49:44.080
Let me smoke that.

49:44.080 --> 49:46.080
I don't even know what these people were doing.

49:46.080 --> 49:49.080
I know it's all their fault.

49:49.080 --> 49:50.080
That's right.

49:50.080 --> 49:51.080
Well, you heard me.

49:51.080 --> 49:52.080
There's smoke in the ice.

49:52.080 --> 49:53.080
I didn't stutter.

49:53.080 --> 49:56.080
I assume you're grandparents.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.080
My parents, they hurt you.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.080
They did it.

49:59.080 --> 50:01.080
We got to blame somebody.

50:01.080 --> 50:05.080
They love the Beatles and they ruined everything.

50:05.080 --> 50:07.080
I'm not on Twitter anymore.

50:07.080 --> 50:12.080
I can't blame the attorney general for anything.

50:12.080 --> 50:14.080
I can't remember his name.

50:14.080 --> 50:17.080
Roseanne Barr.

50:17.080 --> 50:20.080
What do you think of that Mueller report, Jeff?

50:20.080 --> 50:21.080
Any thoughts on that?

50:21.080 --> 50:24.080
I thought it was pretty fucking disappointing.

50:24.080 --> 50:27.080
And it was always going to be disappointing.

50:27.080 --> 50:30.080
And this motherfucker is going to get re-elected.

50:30.080 --> 50:32.080
Fucking mark my words.

50:32.080 --> 50:34.080
I don't mean to be the voice of doom.

50:34.080 --> 50:36.080
But why do you think otherwise?

50:36.080 --> 50:39.080
Is Beto at work going to come save the day?

50:39.080 --> 50:40.080
Oh, yeah.

50:40.080 --> 50:41.080
He's going to do it.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.080
No, he's fucking not.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.080
Oh, yeah.

50:43.080 --> 50:44.080
He's going to win.

50:44.080 --> 50:45.080
No.

50:45.080 --> 50:46.080
He's going to win.

50:46.080 --> 50:47.080
No, he's not.

50:47.080 --> 50:49.080
I bought 50 bucks on him winning.

50:49.080 --> 50:51.080
We're betting tonight.

50:51.080 --> 50:52.080
We're taking bets.

50:52.080 --> 50:53.080
I forgot.

50:53.080 --> 50:54.080
It's March Madness.

50:54.080 --> 50:55.080
Oh, yeah.

50:55.080 --> 50:56.080
Purdue in overtime.

50:56.080 --> 50:57.080
Yeah, a lot.

50:57.080 --> 50:58.080
Something.

50:58.080 --> 51:02.080
So, Dan, did you hear that I took my suit into the dry cleaners

51:02.080 --> 51:03.080
the other day?

51:03.080 --> 51:04.080
Yeah.

51:04.080 --> 51:07.080
As I do, because I wear a lot of suits.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.080
I'm on the road a lot.

51:08.080 --> 51:09.080
I travel.

51:09.080 --> 51:10.080
I wear a lot of suits.

51:10.080 --> 51:13.080
And I took my suit into the dry cleaners and she said,

51:13.080 --> 51:14.080
come again.

51:14.080 --> 51:17.080
And I said, well, no, it's just a little toothpaste.

51:17.080 --> 51:18.080
Yeah.

51:18.080 --> 51:19.080
I like it.

51:19.080 --> 51:20.080
I like it.

51:20.080 --> 51:24.080
Because she assumes that I have jizz all over my suits.

51:24.080 --> 51:25.080
Yeah.

51:25.080 --> 51:27.080
And you assume that she was like, again.

51:27.080 --> 51:34.080
I think that she's very justified because I frequently jerk off all over my suits.

51:34.080 --> 51:39.080
Well, no, it's like, it's a call of dressing like that isn't to make other people come.

51:39.080 --> 51:40.080
What is it?

51:40.080 --> 51:41.080
Nothing.

51:41.080 --> 51:42.080
Go ahead.

51:42.080 --> 51:43.080
Keep going.

51:43.080 --> 51:45.080
I didn't assume it was your cum.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.080
She did.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.080
How do you know?

51:47.080 --> 51:48.080
I was thinking.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.080
Tell the duck joke.

51:49.080 --> 51:50.080
OK.

51:50.080 --> 51:51.080
OK.

51:51.080 --> 51:52.080
The duck?

51:52.080 --> 51:53.080
No.

51:53.080 --> 51:54.080
The guy?

51:54.080 --> 51:55.080
Wait.

51:55.080 --> 51:56.080
Don't happen, Professor.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.080
I fucked up.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.080
I ruined it.

51:58.080 --> 52:07.080
The guy goes to a brothel and he says, I want to have sex with a sex worker, but I only

52:07.080 --> 52:08.480
have a dollar.

52:08.480 --> 52:15.400
And the brothel manager says, then you can use this duck and gives him a duck and he goes

52:15.400 --> 52:26.560
upstairs with the duck and he comes back down and he says, that was the best sex ever.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.520
I can't believe it only cost a dollar.

52:28.520 --> 52:33.920
I probably shouldn't feed back this much.

52:33.920 --> 52:34.920
He's filling out.

52:34.920 --> 52:35.920
But fuck it.

52:35.920 --> 52:39.520
I want to live in a transparent society where you should know, customer satisfaction, thumbs

52:39.520 --> 52:42.320
up, best dollar I ever spent, best sex I ever had.

52:42.320 --> 52:45.960
Goodbye, my name is Herman Johnson.

52:45.960 --> 52:52.680
From the North Hampshire, Johnson's.

52:52.680 --> 52:55.760
My branch of the family represents a bit of a black sheep.

52:55.760 --> 52:57.760
Apparently we have Woody Woodpecker in the crowd.

52:57.760 --> 52:58.760
Don't tell him.

52:58.760 --> 53:02.400
That was the greatest laugh of all time.

53:02.400 --> 53:04.280
Most involuntary laugh for sure.

53:04.280 --> 53:07.160
No one would sound that way on purpose.

53:07.160 --> 53:13.320
He did a full on Woody Woodpecker.

53:13.320 --> 53:16.400
Anyways, that was an intentional departure.

53:16.400 --> 53:21.480
The truth is I can tell this joke effortlessly and sound like a regular road comic.

53:21.480 --> 53:24.560
The guy then comes back the next day.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.280
The sun goes down and comes back up.

53:26.280 --> 53:29.240
There's other things that happen in the town.

53:29.240 --> 53:31.920
This isn't the most important thing that's happening in the town, but it's just where

53:31.920 --> 53:33.920
we are.

53:33.920 --> 53:42.000
And the guy comes back in and he goes, I would like to have the same sex for the same price.

53:42.000 --> 53:47.800
And they're like, here's your duck, fuck no, they don't say that.

53:47.800 --> 53:52.360
They say, here's, fuck, they don't say anything because if they do, it fucks it up.

53:52.360 --> 54:01.400
They put, but I also can't say, it's going to end up being a different duck and I have

54:01.400 --> 54:03.160
to work around that.

54:03.160 --> 54:04.640
How do you do that?

54:04.640 --> 54:08.560
How do you not refer to the duck as either the duck or a duck?

54:08.560 --> 54:10.360
I think it is the duck.

54:10.360 --> 54:13.160
He asks for the duck and they give him a duck.

54:13.160 --> 54:14.160
Do you have the duck?

54:14.160 --> 54:15.160
Okay.

54:15.160 --> 54:17.960
I'll watch it and it says, do you have the duck?

54:17.960 --> 54:20.240
I'll have the duck again.

54:20.240 --> 54:26.040
And they're like, and they silently put a duck on the counter.

54:26.040 --> 54:31.680
And he's like, I can't believe you, white feathers, orange bills, quacks.

54:31.680 --> 54:33.680
You can't tell this joke.

54:33.680 --> 54:34.680
You've told it.

54:34.680 --> 54:35.680
See you in a minute.

54:35.680 --> 54:36.680
Wow.

54:36.680 --> 54:43.440
And I'll pay you afterward this time because even though last time it started with me telling

54:43.440 --> 54:48.200
you how much money I had and you giving me the duck because of the price, this time the

54:48.200 --> 54:52.120
transaction has changed even though I'm back for the same thing.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.480
There's an unspoken sort of like, I'm good for it.

54:54.480 --> 54:55.920
I'm a satisfied customer.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.000
You've seen my Yelp review.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
I'm not going to bulk at the price.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.240
I don't expect it to change.

55:00.240 --> 55:05.520
It's been one day, but thanks for the duck.

55:05.520 --> 55:14.520
And the person's like, they just nod because the less he knows, the better at this point.

55:14.520 --> 55:20.640
So he has again, then pause, hit pause, hold your thought.

55:20.640 --> 55:21.760
Are you fucking around?

55:21.760 --> 55:24.440
Are you really that bad at remembering this joke?

55:24.440 --> 55:29.320
I'm telling the judge, I know I'm taking longer, but I just like I'm pointing out spots that

55:29.320 --> 55:30.320
I don't.

55:30.320 --> 55:31.320
I'm getting hung up on.

55:31.320 --> 55:32.320
Okay.

55:32.320 --> 55:33.320
I'm not.

55:33.320 --> 55:34.320
Okay.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.320
Play.

55:35.320 --> 55:36.320
It was not the part.

55:36.320 --> 55:39.120
I did the part as a joke, like where the guy had the guy's family, whatever, like that

55:39.120 --> 55:41.840
was a joke because I didn't think I would get hung up again by other stuff.

55:41.840 --> 55:44.040
So he comes back in and he gets the other thing.

55:44.040 --> 55:49.640
So he has more sex with what he thinks is the, but he just, he just, he just, he's just

55:49.640 --> 55:50.640
up there.

55:50.640 --> 55:51.640
It doesn't matter.

55:51.640 --> 55:52.640
The camera stays down here.

55:52.640 --> 55:57.960
And then he, so he comes back down with the duck.

55:57.960 --> 56:00.360
And by the duck, we now mean the duck he's holding.

56:00.360 --> 56:03.240
So we're none the wiser.

56:03.240 --> 56:08.920
And he, and he puts it on the counter and he says, now I'm going to settle my tab.

56:08.920 --> 56:16.320
Here's the dollar that I paid last time for sex with the duck and the, and the sex worker

56:16.320 --> 56:25.160
tender says, uh, sex worker tender, welcome to the nineties, bro.

56:25.160 --> 56:35.840
Um, the kids call it being weak.

56:35.840 --> 56:38.400
You need to get weak.

56:38.400 --> 56:39.880
Okay.

56:39.880 --> 56:40.880
Okay.

56:40.880 --> 56:44.880
So the guy comes back down with the, with the duck, right?

56:44.880 --> 56:47.560
He puts on the counter, he put his dollar down and he's about, he's leaving cause he

56:47.560 --> 56:50.400
figures transaction complete.

56:50.400 --> 56:54.240
And the person behind the counter, let's make her a woman just because there's been nothing

56:54.240 --> 56:56.200
but ducks and men in this story.

56:56.200 --> 56:57.200
And I'm not white nighting.

56:57.200 --> 57:01.600
I'm just like, and also genders construct the duck.

57:01.600 --> 57:02.600
We don't even know.

57:02.600 --> 57:03.600
We'll never know.

57:03.600 --> 57:04.600
We don't have to know.

57:04.600 --> 57:10.280
I can't tell if you're doing a bit or not.

57:10.280 --> 57:18.240
Like I, how much of this is you just like the female brothel manager, the sex worker

57:18.240 --> 57:24.200
madam feels problematic, but I don't know why you'll find out five minutes from

57:24.200 --> 57:25.440
now and then, but it'll be too late.

57:25.440 --> 57:26.440
You'll be fired.

57:26.440 --> 57:32.920
Nova, you can you do you understand the world you're joining these walls have teeth and

57:32.920 --> 57:33.920
ears.

57:33.920 --> 57:34.920
You're a good kid.

57:34.920 --> 57:35.920
You still have time.

57:35.920 --> 57:38.640
Just say nothing and you'll be safe.

57:38.640 --> 57:42.680
This joke is this joke is five sentences, by the way.

57:42.680 --> 57:43.680
It's good.

57:43.680 --> 57:44.680
The sex trafficker.

57:44.680 --> 57:48.920
How can you be so cavalier, madam, madam, doesn't that just seem like something that's

57:48.920 --> 57:50.760
going to be offensive a week from now?

57:50.760 --> 57:51.760
Okay.

57:51.760 --> 57:52.760
All right.

57:52.760 --> 57:55.000
Take us back to stay with me.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
You lead the way.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.520
Like I'll keep my eyes closed.

57:57.520 --> 58:03.280
Dad, come through here right now our protagonist is where okay, so he's halfway across the

58:03.280 --> 58:04.280
room.

58:04.280 --> 58:05.280
Okay.

58:05.280 --> 58:09.320
Well, because he put his dollar down and as far as he's concerned, this is how this

58:09.320 --> 58:11.640
place works because he paid a dollar.

58:11.640 --> 58:13.840
He's settled up and the madam right.

58:13.840 --> 58:22.440
I mean, yes, the sex worker tender, the sex says whoa, whoa, you're whoa, whoa, whoa.

58:22.440 --> 58:23.440
Come back here.

58:23.440 --> 58:24.440
Finish paying.

58:24.440 --> 58:25.440
Oh.

58:25.440 --> 58:26.440
And the guy's like, what?

58:26.440 --> 58:29.800
Put a dollar down and they're like, it's five dollars.

58:29.800 --> 58:32.000
He's like, what?

58:32.000 --> 58:37.080
I came here yesterday and had sex with a duck for a dollar.

58:37.080 --> 58:39.880
And the manager says, yeah, that duck had AIDS.

58:39.880 --> 58:47.880
Jeff's joke corner, Jeff's joke corner, Jeff's joke corner.

58:47.880 --> 58:53.040
He's pouring drinks on his butt.

58:53.040 --> 59:02.520
Yes, Joe, it failed to protect my butt quack, Jeff, Joe, I spilled a spilled drink all over

59:02.520 --> 59:06.800
it because you see it was at your long con that you're going to do that joke afterwards

59:06.800 --> 59:11.000
because in this universe they charge by the client's STD.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
It's yeah.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.640
I mean yes, but this duck doesn't have AIDS.

59:14.640 --> 59:17.200
That's why it's about the current.

59:17.200 --> 59:20.080
Why is this duck five dollars and then it was a dollar?

59:20.080 --> 59:21.080
Well, it does now.

59:21.080 --> 59:26.760
All right, let me try again now that we're, now that I, now that I have all, I debugged

59:26.760 --> 59:30.760
tell it, tell it like with like pedal to the metal, I swear to God, gun to my head.

59:30.760 --> 59:32.960
Like you can, you're going to kill my family.

59:32.960 --> 59:37.960
Your two face and you're like, I'm like, I'm, I'm commissioner Gordon and like, like,

59:37.960 --> 59:40.360
like, or wait, whose kid was going to get killed?

59:40.360 --> 59:41.360
Was it commissioner Gordon?

59:41.360 --> 59:44.200
Dan Harmon tells the duck joke perfectly and fast.

59:44.200 --> 59:45.200
All right.

59:45.200 --> 59:48.000
He walks into a whorehouse, it's going to be problematic because I just need to like

59:48.000 --> 59:51.120
not pause for like, it's like, it's a whorehouse.

59:51.120 --> 59:53.800
Start the fuck and it's a madam.

59:53.800 --> 59:56.040
It really, it really is like a five or seven, seven second joke.

59:56.040 --> 01:00:03.200
My transgender caveman friend, my non-binary, uh, tell, tell a joke about, Nova's like

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.160
regressive fucking phraseology.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.480
I'm just going to go with it.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.480
Madams.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:12.680
Dan, to warm up, tell the joke about what, uh, what do you call a hen that can count her

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.680
own eggs?

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:26.520
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, feminists, what, I don't know a math, I'm a chicken now, you're

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.520
warmed up now.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.520
Okay.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.680
It's, it's poultry and motion.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.760
You're ready to fucking go now.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.440
You are ready to tell the fucking duck joke for the first time in your life.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.440
Yeah.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.440
Are you ready?

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440
Yeah.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.440
Yeah.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.440
Okay.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:50.520
The guy goes into a whorehouse where you get whores and he goes to the madam.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:56.720
It's just such an ugly word, Nova, the, the, it goes, I, I, I, I, like, like, like, uh,

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.000
fuck, wait, you got me nervous now.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
It's good.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.200
I want sex and I like, like, like paying for it or I wouldn't be here like, like, I can't

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200
tell if you're doing a joke.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.200
What is it?

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.200
What does he say?

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.200
What do I get for a dollar?

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.200
For a dollar?

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.200
Yeah.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.200
Yeah.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200
Okay.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.200
All right.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200
Let me start over.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.760
He walks into a whorehouse with a heart dick and a dollar and he's like, puts up on my

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.880
dick for a dollar and the whore manager is like, take this duck and he's like, he runs

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:32.480
upstairs and he fucks the shit out of it and he runs back down and he's like, great sex.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.600
No change by, and he comes back in like a fucking hour later, he's like, more duck and

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.600
they give him another one.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.600
He runs up.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.400
He's like, fuck it, fucks it all the hell and he comes back down and goes like, oh,

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.400
same difference.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.400
Like this one's $5.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:51.120
He's like, that one's more expensive than like, it doesn't have AIDS.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:56.440
And now you do probably unless it was, unless it was heteronormative sex, people don't want

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.440
to admit as a low risk actor.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.520
I would say at the end, I love the speed of that one in the anger.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.520
It was great.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.080
I think the punchline, you have to make it more of a, like a Henny Youngman kind of a

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:12.560
I think, I like, I was imagining you like running and crossing the finish line in record

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.560
time.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.400
It was so amazing to see you just run through that.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.040
I just don't know why people are so, I don't, it's a, it's a different kind of talent.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.060
Like people that can like, it's like a combination of like semantics, but also like this like

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:28.800
casualness, like because semantics like are so crucial in all these jokes.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.240
Like you could say the wrong thing the wrong way and it's like so crucial and I'm just

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.240
not used to that.

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.880
I don't, that's not my, like, like, because every joke you tell, it's like that, like

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:42.200
road comic jokes, they're like, it really just come down to like this like cadence

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.320
and like, like, oh, if you say this and then you say that and you say that in a certain

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.760
rhythm and I really don't, I don't, I can't, I always fuck it up because it's like the

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:54.240
guy's got to say like, like, like, oh, I don't know, like, yeah, I can't, I can't

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.240
refer to example.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.360
I mean, I'm obsessed with stupid jokes and I love when people tell me one like the re-enternation

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.480
one is a great joke.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.960
The soup one, I remember that, I think that one's pretty basic, like, there's a guy who

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:16.600
goes to, well, he doesn't go to anybody, it's his wife, we're off to a flying start, by

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.600
the way, I love it.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.800
Well, some of this stuff, it's like, if my first draft is too long in the beginning,

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.360
that doesn't, like, you can just edit that.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.680
I mean, not in the podcast, I mean, just whatever, it's not a failure is my point, like, it's

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.680
me working something out.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.240
Tell me a fucking soup joke.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:38.160
There's a woman that says, goes to a helper in a society, like, whatever, I don't know

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.320
if it's like a sex coach or something, like, I don't know who you'd go to for this.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.360
There's a woman that goes to- It's her husband.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.960
No, you don't, what?

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.960
What soup joke are you talking about?

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.840
No, her husband's going to be there with the punchline, you can't, she can't be open

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.320
with him about her sexual goals, like, they have to play out like a crazy thing.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320
We'll see it.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.320
Is it a waiter?

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.880
Well, she goes to, everyone's heard this joke.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.760
She goes to a sexual mentor, I don't know if that, I don't know where you went.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.760
Is that a therapist?

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.960
She goes to a sex therapist.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.960
Thank you, Nova.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:15.600
It's still a little problematic, I think, and says, like, I have my husband's not having

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:21.440
sex with me, I don't, like, I want to encourage that more than discourage it, the therapist

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:28.640
says, like, why don't you do something like magnificent and adventurous and involving

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:34.120
different outfits and, you know, like, you know, I don't, I'm not telling you to doll

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:40.560
it up, but, like, at the same time, like, sometimes just a little distance from the

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.480
process can, like, like, you know, last thing I'm going to do is tell you, like, you're

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.840
not hot enough for your husband, I'm just telling you, like, like, like, like, maybe

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.040
sex needs to become adventurous again, it needs to become more of an adventure.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.400
This is a fucking four-line joke.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.240
So then, because based on that advice, here's what she does, you're making it harder with

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.920
your jeering.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:08.760
She goes home, it's moving fast enough for almost anybody, it's like, you know how long

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.800
it took for Robocop to become a Robocop?

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.200
This is a crazier story than that.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.520
That guy just got shot, I could say that fast, this guy wanted to be a cop, and then he was

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.760
like too much of a cowboy cop, so he put himself in harm's way, but he didn't know the corporations

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:28.000
that were running the cops, like, actually, were placing high-risk candidates in different

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.560
districts according to their needs for a donor, aka a half-dead body, I mean, long story short,

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.040
this guy's part of, like, a backup plan, like, a pork barrel, like, law enforcement plan

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.680
with a corporation that really is pumping all their money in this thing called the Ed

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:47.920
209, which is this, like, urban pacification thing, it's a fucking four-line joke.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:52.240
And so our hero, who just wants to impress his son based on this show TJ Laser, like,

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.400
he ends up in old Detroit, and he's like, dead or alive, you're coming with me, they

01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:01.400
shoot his arms and legs off, he ends up Robocop, that's less crazy than this fucking shit

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:05.560
with these people that want to have sex so bad that they get in outfits, like, I mean,

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.080
there's nothing wrong with that, but, like, this woman's just, like, bent on self-destruction.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.520
You're doing a bit, you're trying to not go to jail.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:18.520
She goes home, I'm just telling you, this movie would be longer than Robocop, she goes

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:25.240
home, she gets into a, I can't use the word, because you can't use the punchline, like,

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:31.120
she gets into an outfit, like, oh, it's got a cape, it's got, like, a belt, it's got boots.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.800
She's like, adventure, you gotta do adventure as sex, because that's what she's thinking.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:42.080
And so then the husband's, like, in his bed, the husband's in his bed, he's doing a crossford

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:50.680
puzzle that night, she... Oh, that, that, that becomes important later on in the joke.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.720
It does because of his... The fact that he's a crossword enthusiast becomes very important

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.920
later on. It's so important, it is important.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.240
Okay. It's, he's... Yeah, no, it's the whole joke.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.280
The joke is that he's... He doesn't look up from the crossword when

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:09.400
he does the punchline. Okay, go ahead.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.160
The thing that I'm fucked up, though, is the, why, did he, is she in the closet the

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.720
whole night, because... It's a fucking four-line joke.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:21.440
It's four cents. I want to retract some stuff, so she, she

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.760
earlier was trying the outfit on, so make sure it fits, so that he came home and they

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.760
played tribute for shoot. I don't, I don't know if you just love talking

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.640
so much, and you hate jokes that much, but are you really trying to get it right?

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:35.960
It can't be both. I, I don't hate talking. Okay.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.160
It used to be how I got people like me. All right. Then I started doing this shit.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.600
Okay. But that's good, that's good.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.560
Take it from the top. I should, I should have to do other stuff.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.840
Take it, take it from the top. Don't eat blood? What do you people want?

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:52.840
Sorry, I lashed out. The woman tries on the outfit, so just retcon

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.600
that. Like, if it was like Black Orphan or what's that show?

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.600
Like, like where you're like... What is it?

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.040
Orphan Black. I would, I would ask what the fuck you're

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.160
talking about. You guys haven't seen Black Orphan?

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:11.560
It's a four fucking sentence joke. You just love your fucking mainstream

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.760
entertainment. Watch Black Orphan. Get back to me.

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:19.040
It's fucking badass. And it might not be enjoyable for you.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:27.320
Maybe a couple of things you might not want to hear about yourself.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:34.680
That's funny for reasons no one will understand, but me later at home.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.840
I mark spots on the podcast where you're like, yeah.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.400
So she already has this plan. So he comes home, he goes, where's my crossword?

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.560
She's like, where you left it? He gets in bed. They do the thing.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:49.280
It's like, it's going to be a regular stagnant night, but not tonight, not according to her.

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.480
She's going to do this thing. So she's like, I'm going to go do something.

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.040
He's like, what are you doing? He's like, I'll tell you in a second.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:59.360
She goes to the closet. They have like a place. It's like a, like there's room in the closet.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.800
So she can change. She closes the door. He can't see her.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:07.160
He changes. So she comes out of the closet and she's, she's wearing a red cape.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.040
She's wearing red boots. She's wearing this whole outfit.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.880
I can't refer to the, I can't refer to the costume because it's coming up.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.560
If I refer to it, if I describe it in the way that would make you go, yeah, I got it.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.840
So I have to go through every fucking article of clothing because if I say the wrong word,

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:26.000
I ruin the punch line. So she, I have to describe the fucking cape and

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.920
a thing. She's got an S on her fucking.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:35.400
This is my fucking hell right now. And she goes like super pussy and the, and the husband

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:42.200
without looking up from his crossword says, I'll have the soup wait. No, he looks at her

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.800
and then looks back at the crossword because otherwise you'd mistake it for like he just

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.360
loved soup and there was a semantic that he looks up from the crossword and it wasn't

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:58.040
relevant for him to be a crossword, right? Well, why is it a crossword because he has

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.680
to like look at her and then look back at something, an iPad. I don't care.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.360
You got to think like a borscht belt, like old school Jewish comment, like a borscht

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:12.680
belt who tells a joke at the speed of light and the details mean nothing.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.360
Well, congratulations to them.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.720
Thank you for Trump borscht belt generation. Maybe you should be more detail oriented.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:27.560
An old couple are celebrating their 70th anniversary. The man is in bed reading a

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:32.440
paper. The woman wants to spice things up and she ties a towel around her neck like Superman

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.520
and she comes out of the bathroom naked with a towel around her neck and she goes super pussy

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:40.760
and he looks up from the paper and he says, I'll have the soup. Like that's that's how

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:48.760
fucking short that joke is. Do you want the thousand questions? Why is it crossword?

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:53.000
Why did she think that was going to spice anything up? Because she just seen Superman

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.040
too because she's a big fan of a big fan of Richard Donner who got fired off of that,

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:03.320
even though he wrote the screenplay but was fired off of it. And Richard Pryor, I believe,

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:08.760
or that's three fucking. But if she had a towel around her neck, why was she she probably was

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:13.320
like, Oh, no, sorry, this isn't to wipe up your soup. I'm not a waiter. Tell the Thor joke.

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:21.880
Thor joke. The Thor. Thor walks into a bar and the bartender is like, Hey, we don't serve your

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:29.560
kind here. And he's like, What kind? I'm a God from Ragnarok from the rainbow bridge of like

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:39.480
Elsa guard. And Elsa goon. The bartender's like the exits are two to the rear and two to the

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:48.440
side of her. Don't use those ones. I don't know. No, why did it's why did how come how come how

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:56.120
come what what why? Well, I got I have it. I have it. How come how come? Why is being a

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:06.200
why is it? Why is it? Why is it? Why is the why? Why is the job of physical therapy on meth right

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:13.560
now? Why is it profitable to become a physical therapist in Asgard because a lot of everyone's

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:19.640
Thor. Yeah, but they're not all Thor, but you know, they're not all Thor, but

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:27.640
but over time, I could have figured it out. Is that the Thor joke? I think it was not a speech

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:32.040
therapist. No, the Thor joke is no, they're well, they're so well. Yeah, I know that it's not the

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:38.120
word sword, but you just don't get my comedy and like, I don't know what to tell you.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:45.240
Yeah. Like it kills at colleges. So like, and those guys read for a living. So

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:52.920
you just don't get me, man. You like watching these Netflix comedy specials and you're like,

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:58.440
this is easy, but like that was a fucking killer joke. Make up a brand new like joke,

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:04.040
joke like a dad joke. Wait, what was the Thor joke? Well, an ant walks into a

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:10.520
a or just a bar bar. Okay. Is the whole joke going to go like that? No, you're going to

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:16.280
not a heavy shoulder me. He just orders a drink. Just say you ordered a drink. You pause. I don't

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.440
know how much longer I'm going to put up with this, but he orders a drink because in the spirit

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:27.400
of collaboration and I hope it's inspiring. I'm inspired every day. So he orders a drink. Now

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:32.280
just keep in mind. He didn't have to. Yeah. No, he's being very nice about a lot of shit that

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.800
happens in these bar jokes where the person doesn't even order a drink. Like for instance,

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.440
the lobster goes into a bar and he and the bartender is like, get the fuck out of here.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:45.480
It's as I love that joke that the bartender is just like, get out of here. Get out of here.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:52.920
Lobster. That's funny. It's funny before the punchline. This is like, this is funny that

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:58.760
like a bartender, that's it. Get out of here. He's immediately fucked up and there's like one guy

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.480
at the bar that's like, the fuck was that about the bartender? He's like that guy. He's always

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:09.160
doing this stuff. He fucked it up, but that part doesn't matter. He gives me nothing but this.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:13.400
There's nothing but this. I mean, it's a thing. It's semantics, but it's like, you know, the idea

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.200
is that he's a lobster and the bartender has a problem with him doing that, but it's like,

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:21.240
the lobster does that naturally. That's not like, but I think it's just funnier that the bartender

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:31.960
is mad. Get out of here. Now, finish your joke. Why be a bartender at that point?

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:38.280
That's like, I mean, a lobster walking into the bar is going to get you that tightly wound.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.880
What kind of bar allows lobsters to walk down the fucking road in the first place?

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.120
Especially if it turns out that the reason is because he's doing this, which is what lobsters

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:51.080
do. So like the guy should be like, okay, so so far all I'm hearing is that a lobster sometimes

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.560
comes into your bar and you've chosen to be like more of a regular bartender that doesn't have

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.400
lobster. Like you got it. You got like a bar. I mean, maybe this is a universe where lobsters

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:06.520
are like, and men are like, you know, it's like, maybe like what it's like ABC's caveman series

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:12.680
where it was like, like, oh, cavemen are like half of society. Remember, it's based on that

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:18.040
Geico commercial. Who's good? Nick Kroll. Finish the ant joke. So an ant goes into a bar.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:22.120
An ant goes in the bar. And that's why my only point was that I could have chosen for the bartender

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:27.160
to be like, get out of here. But you you made it a bar instead of a dirt mound. You said you

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:32.040
had to get a drink. No, my hands are tied. Like, let's let's let's tell this amazing joke. Let's

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:39.960
erase the chalkboard and ant goes where? Oh, shit. It goes into a hill of dirt. Okay. Like

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:47.560
because I'm not afraid of like organic humor. I'm like, doesn't have to go to a bar. It goes into a

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:53.320
where an ant goes. He goes into one of those hills of dirt that ants make. And he got and the and

01:15:53.320 --> 01:16:00.680
the the guard at the entrance is like, hey, who goes there? And he's like, it's me, Glenn.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:10.680
And the ants like, okay, go through. Do you smell any picnics? And the aunt Glenn is like,

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:24.200
would I be back? And then and the guard is like, yeah, for the queen. And Glenn is like, honey.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.600
So there's got to be some gay joke there, right? Like something about like he said something sassy

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:39.160
like like about like, like, like, I wouldn't go above a hundred and third or something. I don't

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:43.960
know. It's kind of it's like like a picnic or something like for the queen. Spencer do it and

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:49.640
that goes into a bar joke like and that goes into bar. Now I still like my the tavern keepers like,

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:59.800
get out of here. Just because it's like you don't want ants. It's just what Dan liked about the

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:06.840
lobster joke except applied to ants. It's that easy. It's not what is that? What is that? I wasn't

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:11.560
trying. You're not going to trick me. And the Barger says the Barger. Thank you for seeing

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.960
through Jeff's clever tricks. It's part of bull. Look, I was bullied my whole life. I know what

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.040
bullies do. They're like, oh, see, he's fucking cool. He combs his hair. I'm like, I'm not going

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:26.200
to fucking be mad at a nerd that comes as air. Yeah, fucking fascist is capitalism. All right.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:35.320
A a walrus, then a walrus, a walrus goes into a bar goes into a bar. Are you sure? You can pick

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:44.440
the venue. A walrus goes into a blank. You get to pick the venue. A walrus. I don't like I

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:52.120
I you saw how I don't even put me in that area and I set me up for success. Yeah. Well, but then

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.760
there is sex happening. A walrus was into a bar. It's probably easier because a whorehouse is like

01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:03.160
a bar where you instead of boarding drinks, you order like a sex bar. So if I could get over my

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.320
fucking a walrus rocks walks into a walrus walks into a whorehouse and it's like,

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:15.160
okay, I want to have sex. And the person's like, well, do you have money?

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:23.720
And he's like, no, but I have tusks. And they're made of ivory. So they're like, well,

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:29.560
we can't they're attached to you. And he's like, yeah, but how about this? Like,

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:35.880
like, if you if you if you let me have sex, then I'll cut off one of my tusks, and I'll give it to

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:39.560
you. And they're like, why don't you do that first? And he's like, give me a saw. And they're like,

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:50.760
we don't have a saw. And he's like, you can buy a saw with the tusk I give you. And they're like,

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:55.000
how are you going to give it to us if you don't have a saw? And he's like, you know what? I'm a

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:02.920
seal. These are fake. And I'm not coming back. And he throws down these like plastic hollow,

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:08.280
like Halloween store tusks that he was just like keeping in there. And they're like, what are you

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:13.480
doing? And he's like, I'm out of here. The joke's finished. And they're like, it's not a joke. I'm

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:20.040
a human being and the seals like spoken like a person in a joke. And the seals just gone. And

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:26.680
then this person's like, who am I? And then another person comes up and goes like, can I have sex?

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:31.240
And they're like, yeah, everyone can. It's never been that difficult. I don't know what I did

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:36.120
wrong. It's my first day here. I've been yelled at three times. This is fucking crazy. I'll admit

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:41.400
the first two times were my fault. I can see it that way. I'm new here. However, I'm freaking out.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:45.720
I don't think I should have dropped out of architecture school. And the other person says,

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:51.080
you were an architect? Yeah. I mean, I was in school. I wasn't an architect. I'm an architect

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:58.200
and I never went to school. What's your name? Frank Lloyd Wright says the person. But the

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:01.960
architecture student knows it's not Frank Lloyd Wright. They went to school. They've seen pictures

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:08.520
of Frank Lloyd Wright. That's not Frank Lloyd Wright. It's like a guy with like big giant teeth.

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:16.600
So the kid that went to architecture school is like, oh, I get it. This town is just filled

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:24.680
with people that needlessly disguise themselves as species with like tusks. And they just fuck

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:29.960
with people. It doesn't explain the other fuckups I had this morning, but I'm getting it now.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:35.800
And so they go, all right, Mr. Lloyd Wright, nice to meet you. Would you like to have sex?

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:42.280
Is there anything I can interest you in? And the person that's not Frank Lloyd Wright for sure

01:20:42.280 --> 01:21:00.120
is like, yeah, do you have anything in an Asian woman with a dress on and a hat?

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:11.080
And can the hat be filled with money? And the person's been trained to never say no.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.520
And they go, well, first of all, the answer is yes. It's just a question of how much.

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:22.760
We have all that. We can get that. How much are you willing to pay? And Frank Lloyd Wright says,

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:31.800
how much money is going to be in the hat? And the person's like, how much money do you want

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:36.840
to be in the hat? Because it's like your fantasy, right? Frank Lloyd Wright says a million dollars.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:42.520
I want a million dollars in the hat. And the person's like, okay, that'll be a million dollars and

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:49.000
a hundred dollars is what that will cost around there. I'm not really authorized to like me.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:56.040
That's an estimate. An estimate? What the fuck am I standing here for? Why am I embarrassing

01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:02.360
myself having these conversations? I'm like, you can't authorize this transaction? Are you asking

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:07.720
me if I'm allowed to put a million dollars in a hat, find a person based on their race, dress

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:17.560
them in an outfit, and then, no, I'm not. And Frank Lloyd Wright's like, do you realize that

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:23.800
when they taught me how to build buildings, I know how to take them apart. And the architecture

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.920
student's like, you didn't go to school, you said. And he's like, I'm talking about my grandpappy.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.480
And the student's like, I'm going to go get your Asian woman and your million dollars,

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:41.080
I'll be right back. And he goes in the kitchen and he goes to his manager and goes like, I quit.

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:47.640
He's had enough at this point. Yeah, I'm out. And you can go deal with this. And like,

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.640
it's been a fucking intense day. And like, I don't want any more to do with this.

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:55.560
So the manager goes and like, frankly, it's like tapping his foot. It's not Frank Lloyd Wright.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:02.440
Because he thought he thought the job of being a clerk at the front of house at a whorehouse was

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:06.520
going to be a lot easier of a job. His dad's a senator. He's like, you should work at the whore

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:12.520
house. Like that way people come in, they get herpes, they get whores, they like it's a win-win

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.320
like you've got something on people. That's how I became a senator. That's how you're going to

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:19.720
become a senator. Like you got to work around where the fucking is happening. Like this is like a

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:23.320
this is America, you know, when they say make America great again, this is when America was great.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:31.640
So finally, he's at a breaking point. And he goes to his boss and says, I quit, manager goes out.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:35.160
Frank Lloyd Wright is not Frank Lloyd Wright is out there. He's like tapping his foot. He's looking

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:40.040
at the gold vision of all is like looking at the grandfather clock is like like pacing and like

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:44.760
and the manager's like, are you okay? And Frank is like the guy that isn't Frank Lloyd Wright is

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:55.560
like, yeah, uh, no. And this whole argument happens in like the long story short is like the

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:59.720
whorehouse closes. It's out of business because it's just like what the guy the guy wasn't Frank

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.200
Lloyd Wright, but he was like a like a media magnate. Is that what you call him? Sure. Like a

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:09.160
kind of a Hearst figure. Gotcha. And so basically controls the media at that time. Right. And like

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.840
it just just puts a bunch of stuff. He was trying to do a scam. Yeah, I don't know if he caught on,

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:16.440
but like he wanted he thought he could get a million dollars this way. And like,

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:24.440
even if he put the hundred down up front, like it was like he was going to rob. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:28.840
So he overestimated how much money you're allowed to have in a place like that. And like what the

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.080
kids authorized to do. And he just basically but he was so humiliated that he basically bankrupted

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:37.000
himself in his newspaper, putting the whorehouse out of business. That's an entire town collapsed.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.280
They no longer had any literacy or uh, hedonism. They didn't. It was basically a barber and a

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:48.120
train station there. Like if unless you were like that freaked out about getting a haircut,

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:53.160
there was no way you're going to come to this town. That's how uh, the fantasy island ended. Yeah.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:01.000
So I'm sorry. There's no punchline, but the truth is sometimes life gets pretty ugly.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.240
You know, you can't just go into a whorehouse and have a crazy animal encounter. Like these people

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:14.760
have lives and uh, we all exist as part of one web, you know, like when that whorehouse dissolved

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:21.320
its uh, like corporation, they like, how did that go down? It was that. Well, they were in

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:27.560
solvent. Yeah. I mean, it was already a quasi legal business. This was just happening at the

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:33.720
right at like the vanguard of a manifest destiny. Like it was just like you're out there in an

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.280
unincorporated city in the middle of some territory. No one knows what's going on. And it's just like

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:42.840
sex was a business and you know, shit rolls downhill. Sure. They sell you the dream. Like,

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:47.560
oh, you can, you can, you know, anybody can become rich, but it's like what they really mean is like

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:52.760
anybody can, you know, die. Like everything's, everything has a price on it. Like human life

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:58.440
is worth less than a bullet, man. And what happened to the guy that wanted to go in there

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:03.640
for the encounter? The newspaper man? Yeah. Oh, he died. His newspaper went out of business.

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:07.320
His newspaper went out of business. He ended up a prospector and he got a claim jumped.

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:14.440
Holy shit. Yeah. He didn't even have a claim. He was trying to, he's trying to do, like the guy,

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:19.880
you met the guy in this joke, which wasn't a joke, by the way. He was, what he was trying to do with

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.560
that. He just like, he went, he took that. He didn't learn his lesson. He's like, he's like,

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:27.160
he would, he decided he was going to become rich by pretending that he found gold

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:32.520
and saying, I found gold. Does anybody have any money to, I can turn it into silver or something?

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.520
Do you think? They just beat him over the head. Do you think before he went into that whorehouse

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:41.480
and asked for a whore with a million dollars in her hat, do you think he had successfully pulled

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:47.160
that off? In his mind, yeah, but he was born rich. And like, so he basically like lied to like

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:53.400
guidance counselors, people on his dad's payroll. Like he didn't, he mistook like being privileged

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:58.680
for being crafty. Like it's like, try getting away with the shit that this guy, this non-Frank

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:04.360
like. What kind of whorehouse is also carrying around a million in cash? Ask a fucking dipshit son

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.800
of a billionaire that like walks in and like tries to do that. Like the guy, it was just,

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:13.080
he could have stayed at home and sucked on his dad's titty, but oh, that wouldn't have suited

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.160
his ego. Oh, I got to go, I got to go out. I'm going to go tame the wild. I'm going to go bulk

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.960
people out of their money and like write a book about it. Dumb. He traveled only by hot air balloon.

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.920
He was a terrible person. It's just like, he just exuded everything that was wrong with the American

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:34.600
dream. And this is colonialism. This is 1915. 1915. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And he traveled by

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:41.240
Barnaby Johnson was his name. Barnaby Johnson. He caused World War one. He caused it. He caused

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:48.600
it a year after it started. Yeah. Okay. He made people think it started earlier than it did.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.800
Yeah. World War one was essentially like a resolvable skirmish. Tell me what you think was

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:59.240
the worst moment. And I want you to be specific about World War one. What do you think was the

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:05.400
darkest hour? I got to go to Verdun, bro. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Break it down. Right. Everybody

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:13.160
knows. What country? Obviously France. Like, but like, what, hey, what country was which?

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.400
Why were they fighting? Who knows where that was? Like, they thought they were going to

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:23.320
change the answer with their trenches, buddy. And, uh, and their mustard gas and they invented

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:29.480
the water balloon and the fucking torture and the, this is the only war where it started on horseback

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:37.560
and it ended in a balloon. And that's where our whorehouse entrepreneur whorehouse is finance

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.600
world war one. They called them the silent generation, the people that went to fight the

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:48.200
the mustard gas made them quiet and they had to eat rats and they were hats that look like

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:55.480
pie tins and they were just like pink Floyd's song about them. Everybody had a rifle and

01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:00.600
and, uh, everything was muddy and gross and the boots were like up to your calf and and it's just

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:06.680
a bad scene. What do you, what's your opinions on the war of 1812? Oh, what a misunderstanding.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:14.600
The war that traveled faster than the telegraph. Let me tell you that. Boy, that that war could

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:18.520
have been, could have been, we could have saved ourselves a war. We had had a telephone back

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:26.440
then. It's all I knew. I was a war of misunderstanding. They called it the war of 1812. The Canadians

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:34.120
burnt down the White House. I know, I know more than the president and I'm an idiot.

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:41.400
Yeah, I can name half of our Supreme Court justices by all the words to baby got back.

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:50.280
Uh, what's your, uh, what war Dan, do you think, you know, the most about?

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:56.040
Uh, Vietnam for sure. Because, you know, because you were in, you were in the shit. Yeah.

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:02.680
You, you were, uh, what you were lieutenant in Denang. Yeah.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:08.760
Okay. So, all right. See, they don't want to talk about it. Well, I don't, you know,

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:12.120
it doesn't seem like they don't like to talk about it. That's a real soldier.

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:15.160
It feels like I'm at a dentist because they were there. Yeah.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:26.280
Coyotes. So, so I saw the coyote. I saw a coyote that from the brambles behind my house.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.600
Yeah. Is that the neighbor's yard or is that a no man's land?

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.360
I think it's, well, it's, I think it's one of those two. I don't think there's any

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:39.560
scenario in which it's my property. Right. That's, but I just like, cause I could climb up there and

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:45.320
start hacking, but I think there's no partition leading into the neighbor's yard. I don't think

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:49.160
you should do that because it's got to be, that's, that's, I mean, we have reason to

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:54.520
suspect that that's the neighbor's property. So, I think what we need to do is, uh,

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:59.560
I think, I don't know what the first step is because what we can't do is call the city because

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:03.720
we know that the, if you call the city, they will say, we don't do that anymore.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:10.040
You're on your own. And there's like companies, which evokes like black water that will come

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:19.320
put the hurt on your coyotes. Um, and, uh, I, I just, like, all I know is, as the Barack Obama

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:25.720
of this coyote problem, that like future will judge me like, like by whether I acted or didn't act,

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:31.240
and that I don't need to like be decisive. I'm not saying like slaughter the coyotes or put,

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:38.120
I demand this. Like, but I, I'm saying like, I think that neighbor whose territory borders mine,

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:46.520
I think that it's possible that, um, the, uh, pug, the elderly pug that, that twice has fallen

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:51.960
into my yard. I think that dog died. I mean, if it, if it didn't, if it didn't get eaten by

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:57.160
coyotes, it died of old age because I think it died from falling. Well, I mean, yeah, it couldn't

01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:02.040
be, it's fall, like, and my dogs are so sweet, they would like guard it and they were like nice

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:05.720
to it. They're like, Oh, a dog fell in our yard and they would like take care of it and like,

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:11.640
um, and then both times, once my ex-wife, Erin McGathy, and once my dogs that are Allison,

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:15.960
like they, I was never here for these two events, but it happens twice. And like they both times,

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:21.560
um, one of those two characters, like they're not characters. They're human beings. They're

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:28.600
human beings. They're not characters. God damn it. Harmon. Never let it slip. Don't let them know

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:36.520
you're, they're all in your story. If they realize it, they can end the book. I've met them both

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:43.400
and they're real characters. He met that, like, they're kind of like, characters. That's my,

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:51.240
what, why? You mean humans? You forgot the word for human. Um, but you don't just call people

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:59.000
humans. They sound like an alien. I don't know people. People sounds like, like, you know,

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:05.240
word peoples, like both of these people. You mean your ex-wife? What do you mean you people?

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:10.600
It's your ex-wife. I don't know what you said. She was a real like TBS. She was a real character.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:15.560
How do you refer to a group of people if one's your ex-wife and one's your dogs? Those people

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:25.080
women? No, that would be a crazy. That was both of those women. That would be weird.

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:30.280
I mean, thank you for continuing to prove that I was right in being hung up on that and

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:34.040
and barfed out the word character. And there was like, what are you, Dr. Who?

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:42.360
Anyways, so like they took the dog up the hill and they found the owner of that territory. I live

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:48.440
in these windy hills. So it's like, for instance, my neighbor, the Bootsons, we've met on this show

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:58.040
several times. If I go over to their house for a party and I do Hollywood, I actually have to either

01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:03.720
climb over a fence, which actually almost makes more sense. It's kind of weirder what I have to do

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:08.440
if I don't want to climb over a fence, which is I have to walk all the way around with Cody like a

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:12.360
whole or a whole block because their house is right next door to me, but their address is at a

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:16.520
completely different street. And the fence isn't that high. It's like hip. Yeah. And I was telling

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:21.160
them last time, we're going to make like a gate in this fence because also we're living in the

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:26.360
end time. So like there's going to be like a weird like ice agent showing up and going like,

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:32.920
I understand you have the people in your floorboards and we're going to want to have tunnels in our

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:39.080
fucking rich liberal neighborhood and arsenic to put in their tea. Oh, please come in. Yes.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:46.840
I was just telling my housekeeper how American we all are. More chamomile.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:57.960
Ah, yes. I like your community show. Yes. If there was less black people in it,

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:11.240
like the Liao season when they all quit. Donald Glover is kaboot. I got you. Yeah.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:20.280
I'm so blue. I'm turning blue because I poisoned you. Nazi. What? Why? You're so white.

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:24.600
Because I'm a good white guy. I hate fucking Nazis, bro.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.560
Because I'm fucking raised by fucking real Americans. We hate fucking Nazis. That's

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:33.720
that's just the thing you made up after you got into the war for a profit.

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:39.560
Oh, come on. Don't be so fucking cynical, you prick. Come on. We went to war with you fucking.

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:46.120
You're going to say cock sucker. See, because you're fucking you are Nazi. Yeah, you wish.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:50.280
It's different. You just want everybody to mistrust themselves and you're fucking you.

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:55.160
I'm going to watch you die. I'm going to spit on you while you die with your fucking dumb eagle

01:35:55.160 --> 01:36:03.640
medals. Oh, I love my eagle medals. Stupid skull on your hat. You look so dumb.

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:11.400
Hate you. You know why you hate me, right? Yeah. What? What are you going to tell me?

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.680
We're not so different than how come you're dying and I made you tea?

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:21.320
You see me in a fucking eagle hat? We're not so different. Go ahead. Do your monologue purple

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:35.560
dying Nazi. You hate me because you secretly wish you for one moment of your life could feel the

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:45.400
the having one and two Emmys. What you want to what one for community one for Rick. No,

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:50.440
I never won one for community, but it was such a good show. Yeah, that's you're making my point.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:58.200
People who are proud of their race are like coming to the conversation saying I have nothing

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:04.440
to be proud of. If you were talented, you wouldn't be a Nazi. I'm tired. I'm killing myself. I can't

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:10.760
listen to another fucking episode of your bullshit. You're fucking crazy with your ranting. It ruined

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:15.400
your podcast when Trump got elected. What would you do? I thought you loved them. I do, but I

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:22.680
don't want to listen to you blather about it. Oh, he shot himself. Bing bong. Fuck shit. Hello.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:31.720
Hello. Sorry to bug you with the Nazi supervisors and we sent a Nazi over to

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:39.800
harangue and have tea and it's been more than 20 minutes and I really don't want to. I saw the

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:45.880
address. I'm like Rick and Morty. I love. Oh, no, no. Yeah, he just shot himself. What the

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:57.880
What's that mean shit? Oh, okay. Oh shit. Fika. Fika. Isn't that what they take out of your

01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:08.600
paycheck? Move out of my way. Oh, Hans. Why did he do it? He said he loved Jews.

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:22.200
Is that all he said? Why would he say that to you? I don't know, dude, you guys are complicated.

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:28.440
You're what are you going to tell me you all go to therapy? He was fucked up. That gets to the bone.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:36.680
I'm a big fan of your work. I know I'm not just a Rick and Morty fan. I also have read your blog.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:43.240
I followed you my whole life and although you've had your ups and downs,

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:51.560
you're sort of window into the complexity of mathematical chickens.

01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:03.400
By the way, where is Jeff Davis? Oh, he lives close by. Knock knock. Oh shit. It's Jeff.

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:09.880
Maybe the zeppelin dropped him. Oh, Jeff, there's Nazis here. Oh shit. One of them killed

01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:13.480
themselves. Okay. Wow. The other one came to pick him up and that's everything's fine.

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:19.480
This seems like a bad time. No, it's the best time. I mean, it's not as good as when America was great,

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:25.000
which you will never pin me down on when that was. I just want it again.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:33.160
You know, like when I was 10, like when the Muppets were syndicated, make America great again.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.440
I like it to be great again before I met a black person.

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:42.760
I can see by the insignia on your lapel that you're a colonel.

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:52.200
I'm a colonel first class Yeti edition, super special forces, secret double tier platinum,

01:39:53.880 --> 01:40:03.480
double bead, through line, double strength, titanium, fully creasoned commander of the ultimate

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:09.160
death platoon, a fucking like million. I had to kill like a million homeless people.

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:12.680
Hey, Dan, do you do you have any beers in the fridge? Yeah, there's Grohl's

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:21.160
because when in Rome, okay, I open the fridge. So anyways, when did you go from being in ice to

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:28.840
being a full blown German soldier? Yeah, that just it's like a Christopher Durang, like mystical

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:35.320
realism, the kind of like I just became just a general Nazi. You know why Hitler killed himself,

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:43.160
right? He was a he was an angry drunk. No, that's why he stopped drinking, right? Which I never

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:50.600
understood that you know why he killed himself. Gas belt, gas belt. So I don't like the joke.

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:56.520
I don't like the joke. And I'll tell you why kids trivializes victims. It's a great joke.

01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:00.760
It's not a great joke. It's not a great joke, because it's like, it's like, oh, yeah, he

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:05.880
gassed a lot of people. But it's like, it's, you know what, you know, the only way it wouldn't

01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:11.000
make it a better joke. But you know, you have to he saw his gas bill, and it had all the names of

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:17.960
all the victims. And here are their names. Why is that six million names later? It's still not

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.720
a funny joke, but at least you're a good person. Like because it's like, yeah, like those people

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:27.960
those are the people that aren't laughing. They couldn't join us. You know, I you know how you

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:35.800
tie the shoes in little Nazis. Oh, see, that's that's yeah, because it's like when Hitler's

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:40.200
like Dracula, that's when it's funny. When it's like, oh, do you know what is he? What is he?

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:46.120
Why does he like the radio because he like likes us to the hitlers? I don't know. Like that's not

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.800
I can't do it. I can't riff it. All right. That's why some of the stuff's joke. Don't get mad at me

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:55.160
for failing to do a Hitler joke. You're bad people. What could be Hitler jokes are better?

01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:01.960
Wait, so because I'm because I'm a good person. Why are the ice people actually like full on

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:07.560
like full blown Nazis? In the situation? Oh, yeah, well, I asked the same question. But the answer

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:15.080
is why why was why did Robin Williams head float in the Baron Munchausen because Terry Gilliam's

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:23.240
like like like, hey, come on, because he was let's do it drunk. Anyways, you know that Stalin joke

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:29.240
with the capitalism, you could do that with the DSA. It'd be like more modern. You know, it's like

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:35.080
why does the DSA only spelled in lowercase or something? Right? Yeah, just thought I'd circle

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:41.960
back around for that. They might they might they might send you 10,000 tweets though. No,

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:47.480
they'll love it. They'll be like, holy shit, go on chapeau. They love saying that. Yeah, they love

01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:53.080
to drag your fat ass and then tell you to go on chapeau. They love dragging fat asses. I like

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:59.720
I got that treatment because I made a joke about how it's funny that McDonald's ended up like

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:05.080
suffering for not licensing Rick and Morty but still trying to like do a Rick and Morty thing

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.760
with the Szechuan sausage. It's like, yeah, you got it. I made one joke about it. I was just like,

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:13.960
oh, I've told that story. That was the worst day of my Twitter life. And it wasn't the day I quit

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:18.360
Twitter. I was just like, I was like, walked into this thing. I had no idea the world had changed

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:23.160
that fucking much that that much was at stake. I was like, I thought you could safely make a joke

01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:28.360
about how McDonald's sucks for like being a corporation and like, like, who cares if they

01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:35.080
have a bad day at the hands of the worst fans of this show? Who cares? And I was like, one person

01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:38.600
was like, you know, it's kind of fucked up. Like some people work at McDonald's. It didn't identify

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:42.760
themselves. I was like, I was like, you know, or he's like, he was like, it's just to rip off a back

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:47.800
to the future. Fuck you. Why should McDonald's have to pay for your property if you rip off back to

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:53.640
the future? And his his his Twitter icon was him in a Rick fucking costume with green things on

01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.840
his lip. And I said, you got some flux capacitor on your fucking lip there, like Mr fucking property

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:02.600
manager. And he's like, okay, here's the thing. I work at McDonald's and I was on this channel,

01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:06.840
and I'm like, I said some shit to him. And then it was like, there were socialists watching me

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:11.640
yell at him. Where I was like, because it took like hours for the kid to just go, I was a cashier

01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:15.400
at McDonald's. And I feel like a piece of shit, because I work for McDonald's. And I don't want

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:19.160
a bunch of fucking weird incels jumping up on counters yelling at me, because I don't know,

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.480
it's Szechuan sauce from your fucking show. And I was basically like, yeah, so it took you all that

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:28.760
fucking time to just say, like, you have a fucking agenda in the conversation. I don't have a fucking

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:32.840
agenda. I'm just hanging out going, I think it's funny that this corporation didn't pay for this.

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:37.320
I can afford to laugh. You're just fucking like doing this shit. And then it got all like, there's

01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:42.360
all this, hey, everybody, Dan Harmon's doing an edgelord rant against a socialist that just wants

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:49.480
minimum wage. And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. I hate everyone. I that's fun. I now hate everyone.

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:56.760
I hate my fans. I hate the minimum wage workers. I who else can I hate? I hate rich people. I am

01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:04.120
one. Now I hate myself. I'm just going to crawl into a fucking shell and have a great life.

01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:12.040
Hey, Spencer, do you have our character sheets? Yeah, come on. That's I mean, I love to play D&D,

01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:19.320
but that you added your messages. Fuck you. No, you're doing a podcast. My message is we have 15

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:25.240
minutes left. And I would like to play a fast lightning round of combat with me and you and

01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:31.800
I'm Chad. Combat each other. Huh? Yeah. Huh? Well, you want to fight me? You're like, no,

01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:38.120
you and I are in a dungeon. Like we're in a combat round. Yeah. So you are going to fight each other.

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:41.880
I thought you were like a Milwaukee friend that was like, come on, let's wrestle in the front yard.

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:45.400
Like I just told me that you're jealous. It's been so long. I forgotten your characters.

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:50.280
I forgot your character's name, Dan. It's been that long. Yeah. Well, yeah, I don't know where I

01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:57.960
mean, what's your character? I don't know. Spencer, what's, what's Dan's character called?

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:04.840
Or audience? Oh, Carlos, the intermissive. And I'm Chad, the fire liker. I have a story that I can

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:11.960
jam into a real short thing because I was like, I was, I was like looking for a microphone for my

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:19.720
for my iPad pro so I could sing a song into my iPad pro. And I was looking for a microphone

01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:24.120
because it needed like, like it was a, it was a bunch of Michigan guys, like how you,

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:27.800
they got a USB-C port or whatever. It's like, like, oh, you got to be more, you got to have a thing.

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.720
I was like searching through my closet for a microphone and I was like, God damn it. Where's

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:36.360
that? I think I had an XLR thing. It's like been here since I dabbled in any of this shit.

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:39.880
Where is this thing? And I'm getting real frustrated. And I find this unopened package

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:46.760
that was a Citronella dog collar. It's like, like anti barking collar for, for that I had bought

01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:52.200
from Amazon, I think maybe in some fit. And like, I never opened it. And I was like looking at

01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:57.640
it's covered in dust. I was like, oh, anti barking collar. And there's like a picture on the,

01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.480
on the package of like a dog. It's like,

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:06.600
it's like, yeah, what's he going to do? It's just, he looks contrite.

01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:11.800
You can tell from his eyes that like a mailman's near him, but he's like, there he is again.

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:18.120
And last time I don't hear anything from me about it. And I just, I was like, shit man,

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:22.600
Harvey barks a lot. Like, like he's always barking. He's a fucking loud dog. He's always

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:26.120
be barks at other dogs. He barks at everybody. And then I was like, dude, you're looking for a

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:34.360
microphone. That's what I was like when I was listening to the story. I was like, yeah, yeah,

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.920
what about the microphone? Exactly. Like I bark like Harvey doesn't have a podcast. Harvey

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:43.400
doesn't like, like I'm barking all the time. Like Harvey's just like, he's got one mode of expression.

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:47.240
Like I'm not, and if you're listening and you're like, I have a citronella collar for my dog.

01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:52.120
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not high-roading you at all. I, I, I, I, because I live in a,

01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:57.320
Harvey barking doesn't, it's not hurting anybody. It annoys me, but like it doesn't,

01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:01.400
it's not like anybody else is complaining about it or whatever. If you live in an apartment and

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:05.720
you got a dog and you used a citronella collar, that seems like a, I'm not, I'm not going to be

01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:09.800
one of those people. That's not the point of my story. But I was like, Harvey's just like, he's

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:13.800
just, he has his own little podcast. Like he just, he likes to bark. Like, like he's got,

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:17.400
he doesn't even have thumbs. He just like has little legs that like carry him from one place

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:23.000
where he can bark to another. And I kind of, and then today I was sort of like, because I, I felt

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.600
that way. I was like, I watched him like play with the next door neighbor dog. And then there was

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:30.120
like some other, there was a neighbor walking his dogs. And I said to Harvey, it was like,

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:33.880
buddy, there's some dogs over there. Don't you want to bark at them? Because he wasn't

01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:37.080
even barking at him. He was like, wanted to fetch a ball. And I was like, I don't think you saw

01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:41.720
those dogs though. And he like saw him and he's like, rough, rough. And the neighbor like waved

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.040
at me and I was like, yay. And then like, and then and then and then Harvey finished barking.

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:50.920
And I was like, good job. And it was like the same, the same stuff happened, except I wasn't

01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:55.720
like miserable about it because I wasn't like, oh, he's not supposed to do that. Like, you know,

01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:07.640
he's just, it's just his podcast. What, what are we doing? You're in a dungeon? Is that

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:11.000
what you wanted? What did you, what were we saying? We only have like 10 minutes. Like,

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.640
like, let's just, let's just throw us into the fire right now. Well, yeah. Okay.

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:22.520
Dan, you're gonna leave this up. None of you guys know what's going on.

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:27.320
I bet the last thing I said is let's go make a potato farm. Right. I was like,

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.080
I was like, let this guy work on Harmon Quest.

01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:32.680
Uh huh. What is that?

01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:44.520
Wait, so can we just like play like a lightning round of D&D? Yeah, but Steve plays. That's part

01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:52.760
of it. Is Levy here? I don't know. Levy. I, Levy, Steve Levy, everybody. Steve Levy.

01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:05.640
What's happening? Are you, I, what have you done since I talked to you about the coyotes?

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.520
I, I did a quick search online if there was an organization or a person who handles anything

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:17.160
like that. And here comes the Christopher Walken character in this Adam Sandler movie.

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:24.920
Didn't, didn't seem like there is. I'm here to take care of you coyotes. Sorry. I don't think

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:27.400
there's a person for that. Are you sure you want to play D&D? You don't want to do the scene of

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.760
Christopher Walken? I'm showing up to take care of my coyotes. Why don't you want to play D&D?

01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:39.160
Yeah, I'd love to. Hey. I distracted him. Knock, knock, knock. Why? Who's, who's there? Me.

01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:49.880
Me, who? Sorry. No, I'll start over. Knock, knock. Who's there? Dwayne. Dwayne who? Dwayne

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:57.480
the Tub. I'm drowning. There's a name. There's a, there's a famous name Dwayne. That sounds

01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:04.840
more like the word drain than Dwayne. Doesn't matter. Look, I, I saw a rogue family of coyotes

01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:10.200
in your yard. Oh shit. Are you Christopher Walken? Yes. I'm Christopher Walken. Come in.

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:16.360
The famous actor. Thank you. Come in. Come in. Thank you. I could have come in without you even

01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:26.680
opening the door. Oh my God. Yeah. You got coyotes. Yeah. I called about, I called the city, but

01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:31.720
they said they couldn't send anyone, but then you must then get called. There's only one way

01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:39.640
to get rid of coyotes. Did you bring me out to talk about coyotes? Who the fuck is this guy?

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:44.280
This is my assistant Steve Levy. I told him to call people about coyotes. This is Christopher

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:51.560
Walken. Steve, he's famous. He's from Hollywood. I'm an actor. Yeah. I hate coyotes as much as

01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:56.200
anyone does. Do you want to come back and look at the spot where I think there's a nest?

01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:03.400
Coyotes have a nest? Yeah, they have nests. What did you think they had? Can I, can I bring

01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:14.520
my friend and Jeff Goldblum? Yeah, yeah, you can. Okay. Hey, Jeff, come in. Jeff Goldblum,

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:27.320
I want you to come in here and help me with this coyote nest. That looks like a problem.

01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:36.680
Hey, Jeff, I know you hate coyotes too. Well, it's not, Chris, if I can correct you,

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:51.480
it's not that I hate a coyote. It's just that they once ate my cat. Well, Chris,

01:52:51.480 --> 01:53:03.160
help Dan Harmon. He created Rick and Morty. Oh, it's funny you mentioned that. I was binge watching

01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:13.480
R&M as much as I call it. And I thought that the last season was very good. Oh, thank you.

01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:19.080
Oh, Dan Harmon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, Jeff. Hi. Hey, Dan. I like you on criminal intent. I mean,

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:28.600
it's... Well, that's very kind of you. Dan, I gotta tell you, it's very kind of you to say that.

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:34.920
I don't think it was my best work. I actually wish that Alicia Witt would have kept like working on

01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:39.880
the show. I really liked her. Well, you're very sweet, Dan. You're very sweet. Let's go kill some

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:53.160
coyotes. Okay, you go out back. There's a coyote nest near the south wall of the property.

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:59.000
I cast... Wait, do you guys hate me? What is this?

01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:12.120
No, but I understand you. Do you? I do. I do. Do you accept that I am as confused as you are?

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:17.320
I did earlier and then at a point I was like, well, maybe he doesn't.

01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:24.040
I wanted to play D&D and then it became Jeff Goldblum. Did you really want to play D&D for 10

01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:28.520
minutes or did you feel like me? Like, sometimes it's just like, what are you trying to do with

01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:33.960
me? What about a flop in your app? Can we do a quick combat round with coyotes in Dan's backyard

01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:42.120
with Chris Walken and Steve Levy? You were all... You were just doing that. Yeah, but let's start

01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:49.480
the combat. That's not like... That's a bread crumb. I don't care about that. Okay, all right.

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:56.040
Just do that then. No, no, no, no. Now, let's just lay the seeds of a D&D thing.

01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:03.720
Well, now finally, it's now the point where it's not long enough. That's what's weird about it.

01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:09.000
All right, suspense. Lay down what's going on in Dan's backyard. There's coyotes.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:09.500
Come on.

01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:17.960
I am livid. No, in the D&D campaign, not the backyard.

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:26.280
There's no time. We have three minutes. That's not ten minutes.

01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:35.640
All right, three minutes of D&D. No, jeez.

01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:39.640
Bro, just run it.

01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:50.360
I can't. I'm sorry. I don't normally cow to hecklers, but if there's ever been a situation

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:58.520
where a bro needed to just run it. I mean, talk about a voice of reason.

01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:07.800
No, but like remember earlier when you're like, oh, we don't have any time. Yeah,

01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:15.560
like that concern is now valid. Like back then it was less. It wasn't invalid. What about this

01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:21.240
pressure? What if you lay down the intro to like where we were at? You decided to become

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:28.840
potato farmers? That was already said. Okay, okay. That's the whole thing. So so so tell us

01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:34.360
I mean like we're wearing what's been a while that we're working on the potato farm right

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:39.720
or no you decided to become potato. Okay. Yeah, so we don't control what happened.

01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:42.440
Tell us what happened. Just run it bro.

01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:53.320
Bro. They're willing to stay for another eight minutes. I really

01:56:53.320 --> 01:57:03.400
love

01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:15.320
hey uh hey uh Chad and uh your Chad I'm Chad Carlos and that with Goldblum to Goldblum kept calling

01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:23.080
what's I forgot his name I don't uh what's Carlos now you're Carlos you're

01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:33.160
oh yeah diary jr. Hey Carlos DJ got some bad news for you. We got a low potato yield.

01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:38.200
Fuck it looks like we're gonna have to go out and kill some people to make some money because

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:43.000
the potatoes are not gonna bring in what we thought we're gonna make. Well you say that every harvest

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:51.080
well we're we're bad at potato harvesting. Yeah but we were worse at killing people and it's a

01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:57.720
worse thing to do. I think we are better. I mean we like look around and count your potatoes.

01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:04.120
I like to think it's quality over quantity. They're pretty damn good potatoes. They're good potatoes

01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:10.360
you like the taste. They were yeah. Uh look I don't want you guys know how many potatoes it takes

01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:21.080
to kill an Irishman. Zero? Yeah none. What's an Irishman? Yeah. Do you do you know what do you

01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:31.560
know what kind of meat a priest is allowed to eat on Fridays? Fish? None. It's an old from the old

01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:39.640
do you take that Catholics? Does Friday a thing with them? I don't even know. I as much as I like

01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:45.560
the lifestyle of being a gentleman farmer. I kind of miss the days of traveling and being on

01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:49.240
being on quests. You never became farmers.

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:58.280
Well well it'd be nice to know that a while ago. I said you decided to become farmers. Yes we

01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:05.880
fucking did. No that's not what deciding means. Okay well okay you run it bro. Oh Jesus Christ

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:12.120
that that makes a lot of sense. The reason why we never grew any potatoes is that we never

01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:21.000
seeded or harvested any actual potato. Come on you can't you you don't you don't you're not like

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:27.960
our monkey. I get that but like if you don't want to do it then like we're you know do you want to

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:34.040
tell us what happened instead of us becoming farmers because that you decided to become farmers

01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:39.400
right we decided and then we ended and then that was it. Okay so like oh you're saying like you're

01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:44.840
not allowed to like advance time and assume that you you need to roll for several seasons of potato

01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:50.200
farming or okay all right. I mean we could talk all about all of that. He's like we're not we're

01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:54.600
not going to let time have passed between seasons like we're starting where we left off. I feel

01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:59.400
like we left. I thought you wanted to become potato. I thought that's what you wanted to be doing.

01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:07.000
I didn't know that's what I'm not doing. I say to DJ and to Carlos I don't want to be a potato

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:12.680
farmer. I want to I want to. But you've been one for three years now. Yes. No. No. I mean I don't.

02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:24.600
I want to go work for the church of the silver flame. Well you haven't had enough of that.

02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:31.160
We didn't get it right. Let's let's let's for the first time in our lives go like go do something

02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:38.360
that matters. Then what? I prayed. Spencer what's the God of the silver flame is there a name? The

02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:47.560
silver flame. I get on one knee because they don't like it when you're on both knees. I say

02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:55.880
silver flame. Guide us. Let us redeem ourselves. Send us a mission. Send us a cause.

02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:03.880
To go defend you for. All right. A potato falls in your lap.

02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:20.520
You have a lap when you kneel. I mean I was on one knee so there's a half lap.

02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:27.720
Fucked up. Jesus. Weird. I found a magic potato. I opened up the magic potato to

02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:31.160
see if there's anything inside the magic potato. No it's just broken in half now.

02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:37.720
Damn dude you're good at opening those potatoes. I get down on my other knee and I say

02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:45.160
silver flame. If that truly was you send me another message. What in the.

02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:54.360
I just say that. Well I don't need another sign. That's fucking that's more than you

02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:59.480
should be able to ask for. I was right. I think well I guess nothing happened so I

02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:03.320
guess that we're just potato farmers now. Well we decided we were going to be.

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:13.560
I wouldn't say we were. Can I invite my friend Jeff Goldblum over.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.920
No I'm kidding. I didn't mean to make that sound that implied that the answer is no.

02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:27.240
Look the truth is you guys don't have to come with me. It's not like.

02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:32.360
We're not potato farmers. We're warriors. We're spiritual warriors. We've done nothing

02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:37.160
but fail. We never remember what we're doing. Why do you wake up at 8 a.m. every morning and

02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:44.120
lift and pump iron if you're not. That's not potato prepping you know. You're getting ready for

02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.880
something. You're not a potato prepper. That's me. That's me trying to live past 47.

02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:56.680
Because I like milkshakes and Philly cheese steaks. And my fiance who's 12 years younger

02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:00.520
than me and a woman which means she has 24 more years on average to live than me.

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:03.880
I don't want to like die going like oh man.

02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:15.640
Don't break the fourth wall. Hey this character doesn't work out. Can I give you guys like

02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:22.040
easy pitch. Let's stop potato farming. That's not what we're meant to do. You're at your pit.

02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:27.800
You're acting like you're subversive now. We haven't even started potato farming and you're

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:33.560
like what if we. So one thing we haven't tried. Look I'm. What were you going to say. I just

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:39.720
I just pick a direction and then I'm like OK great. And then the next episode happens and

02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:44.200
you go the opposite direction. So like the last time you're like what if we were potato farmers

02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:49.400
and I was like OK. Right. And now you're like all you're doing is like we can't be potato farmers.

02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:54.040
Not me. I'm not doing. No I know. But it's just like. But it's like.

02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:59.400
The only if the only thing you want know is that you don't want to do the thing there is.

02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:04.360
That's not the only thing that I know. Right. I'm stopping you there. But this is the loyal you.

02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:09.720
All right. Right. If the only thing one does is nothing then nothing gets done. Yeah I get that

02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:13.080
right is why I wanted to become a potato farmer because I was like that's a thing I can remember

02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:18.360
through a blackout drunk to the next episode. Like we're because I felt like we're you perceive

02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:26.840
me or us or the royal we as like disrespecting the game. I know I'm always like the impetus

02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:32.440
between me behind me. The potato farming thing was honestly like as usual which I've done it

02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:37.880
before where I'm just kind of like we're like we're like shitting all over this thing that Spencer

02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:41.800
preps for like we never know what we're doing and we always end up like burning people's houses

02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.360
down and it's like not like we don't know what we're doing. We're always like oh what's your

02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:50.280
name. The person's like my name is Todd. I've known me for 11 years and we're like yeah but I thought

02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:54.120
you were Todd. We're like no the elephant's Todd and then he's like excited about horses and then

02:04:54.120 --> 02:05:00.600
we're just like like we just kill people and then we don't know and I just like I dream of like

02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:06.920
I'm like oh well maybe if we reset and we're just like like we make it simple like willow and we

02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:12.120
just go plow a field and then we can just fucking really carefully like if an adventure comes along

02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:18.920
we can like be like okay like we can't fuck this up and we'll just be like let's baby step this and

02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:25.320
like let's take it seriously and not fuck it up. It's just my it's my it's my desire to do well.

02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:31.240
No I get all that. I get all that. It's it's just again it's that now you're not doing that

02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:35.800
and that's all you're spending time doing. I thought I was trying to get us out of potato

02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:41.480
farming and just try to like trigger like that we were going to go on a new quest. I think you

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:49.480
should you you should let me potato farm because it seems like a thing that needs to happen to you

02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:55.400
because you don't want it to happen. Okay I use my skill of wild empathy.

02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:03.400
That makes me befriend animals. I befriend animals

02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:10.600
and can I conjure an animal or is that animal I already have to be there?

02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:17.720
Well that would be like a separate spell. It's been it's been good adventuring with you boys.

02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:23.400
All right like look I'm bored. I don't want to be a potato farmer. I know I know if that's your

02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:28.040
gang like I can dig it. I didn't mean to I didn't mean to pitch it like it's something I think we

02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:37.160
should all do. I feel bad. I feel like a bad person. I feel bad at what I do. I feel like I

02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:41.240
don't know how to do it right and I want to experience the thing that normal people experience

02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:46.120
which is like oh shit I'm mad about this so I want to do it. I know exactly what I want to do

02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:50.280
and it's like I get orders from the church and then I'm like reacting to a backstory and I forget

02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:55.160
these details and it's just a tangled mess. I just always feel like I'm a fucking guest

02:06:55.160 --> 02:07:03.240
at some party thrown by a stranger. The stranger is me. We worship a flame and it's not even the

02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:11.880
color of regular flame. I haven't lost my faith in our God.

02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:21.480
Just lost my faith in myself. Why don't you talk it out like maybe like in a rhythmic way.

02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:33.720
I think you're suggesting that I invent singing and I'm right. You invent rapping. You can sing it.

02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:40.600
Do it Stevie Nicks style because she just got inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:52.440
or you can test it like drinking. I don't want to know what a waterfall does.

02:07:52.440 --> 02:08:04.360
Waterfalls do fine. I don't need to know why the leaves go down.

02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:10.200
Just something that leaves the side

02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:22.600
because when the planet goes round and round the people feel safe and sound but the devils

02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:34.520
in the hollow earth help the Jews plan 9-11. They were worn out of the buildings.

02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:47.400
You can Google it. Cliff Hanger. Thank you for coming to Harmon Channel everybody. Steve Levy.

02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:54.040
There's more to that song and it actually turns out. I'm your Comptroller Jeff Davis.

02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:58.120
Thank you all for coming. Thank you for Zach up there laying down the jam.

02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:04.440
Your Game Master who didn't get to Game Master anything is Spencer Crittenden.

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:09.880
How about your mayor, Dan Harmon everybody. Thank you so much for coming. We love you.

02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:21.720
We duly appreciate you coming down. We drive fast and take chances.

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:39.560
Did you get any of that? It's a good show.
