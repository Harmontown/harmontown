WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
When we set out to make this, we really, we came up with a filter that is, we like to

00:06.640 --> 00:09.480
call right brain comedy.

00:09.480 --> 00:13.600
The combination of funny and audacious and authentic.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.040
And then we came up with a list of people that we really wanted to work with.

00:17.040 --> 00:22.300
And at the very tippy top of that list was Dan Harmon.

00:22.300 --> 00:25.840
Everything that he's done with regard, they're loading on the stage.

00:25.840 --> 00:30.320
I'm literally vamping so that they can load Dan's mock-down stage.

00:30.320 --> 00:34.440
So we really wanted to work with him.

00:34.440 --> 00:39.600
And he pitched a show which is the marriage of Dinner for Five, Rick and Morty in Game

00:39.600 --> 00:41.600
of Thrones.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.960
And it's a brilliant idea, it's really strange, but I'm not going to talk about it.

00:45.960 --> 00:50.920
I'm going to actually bring up the creator himself, a TV, literally a TV legend.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.400
I'm really happy he's here, I'm grateful he's here.

00:53.400 --> 01:09.880
Mr. Dan Harmon, no, don't step on that.

01:09.880 --> 01:14.320
The first thing they told me is don't walk on that.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.320
Just to trap you.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.320
What in the fuck?

01:16.320 --> 01:17.320
What?

01:17.320 --> 01:18.320
What?

01:18.320 --> 01:21.200
They literally, I should have probably told you that beforehand.

01:21.200 --> 01:27.240
That's not, there's signs everywhere for everything, that's the one place there should

01:27.240 --> 01:28.240
be one.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.400
We had a long conversation, they said whatever you do, don't let Dan walk on that.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.960
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, who went there?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.960
I have failed horribly at everything.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.080
Everyone knew but me.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.080
How are you?

01:38.080 --> 01:42.960
Another thing that, well, here's the thing that everyone knows about you, you can get

01:42.960 --> 01:46.840
Werner Herzog, the real one, for like a thousand bucks.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.720
I've done it.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.720
We decided to go with a fake Werner Herzog.

01:50.720 --> 01:58.360
That's not on record, that's just some guy doing a, he's a thousand bucks.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.360
Werner?

01:59.360 --> 02:00.360
The real one.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.360
We should have just called him then.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.040
He doesn't, he always wants the money, his documentaries are not.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.240
Don't make money, everyone knows.

02:05.240 --> 02:09.000
I used to make documentaries, that's why I'm making comedy now.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.560
Thank you so much, it's great to be here.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.560
Thank you.

02:13.560 --> 02:18.520
So, can you talk a little bit about what Harmon Quest will be?

02:18.520 --> 02:23.640
It's something that I've been conceiving ever since the day that we were doing Harmon

02:23.640 --> 02:28.160
Town, my podcast, which was never a career choice, in fact, it's been detrimental to

02:28.160 --> 02:32.640
my career in every way, because it's the show at which I played the Chevy Chase voicemail

02:32.640 --> 02:37.880
and got fired, but I subsequently made it into a podcast because I was like, well, if

02:37.880 --> 02:42.680
this is not going to be intimate, then let's just broadcast it and at that show, at one

02:42.680 --> 02:48.920
point I thought, I've been fascinated with a certain fantasy role-playing game that

02:48.920 --> 02:56.120
has no name, let alone any initials or anything that anyone would recognize.

02:56.120 --> 02:59.720
My entire life, I've written a lot of sketches about it, it's like, it's my introduction

02:59.720 --> 03:07.720
to everything before improv, before anything, it was like the ultimate, like, gait into

03:07.720 --> 03:08.720
storytelling.

03:08.720 --> 03:15.520
Yeah, and just safety for nerds and this whole culture that we've entered.

03:15.520 --> 03:22.520
And so, in the podcast I said at one point, at the time I thought the joke will be how

03:22.520 --> 03:26.600
not entertaining it is to play this game.

03:26.600 --> 03:31.640
And so, I actually thought in my head, I bet in my audience, if I ask for seven Dungeon

03:31.640 --> 03:34.960
Masters, seven will raise their hand.

03:34.960 --> 03:39.160
And nobody raised their hand, except for one guy who came up on stage, and his name was

03:39.160 --> 03:45.920
Spencer who we'll meet later, and he'll later say he was living in the Seamy Valley area

03:45.920 --> 03:50.880
and he came that night through some weird, pot-induced hallucination that he was like,

03:50.880 --> 03:55.880
I bet I should go ask, I think I should play D&D with Dan Harmon.

03:55.880 --> 04:02.040
It's all very trippy and weird, but he became a fixture and we've been playing the game

04:02.040 --> 04:03.040
ever since.

04:03.040 --> 04:09.360
Since then, my fascination with the funniest thing I've ever seen on TV, which was the

04:09.360 --> 04:16.600
Ricky Gervais HBO show, because I love the relationship between the real audio of Carl

04:16.600 --> 04:22.320
Pilkington trying to explain himself and this team of animators that are like so gifted

04:22.320 --> 04:30.120
that they're like, oh, no, this guy is struggling and being mocked, but I went to art school,

04:30.120 --> 04:37.240
I can show you what he means when he's talking about his theory about birds or worms or something.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.880
They actually make his point better than he ever does.

04:39.880 --> 04:44.320
Yes, absolutely, and everyone's point is made when they're supported by-

04:44.320 --> 04:45.320
Beautiful animation.

04:45.320 --> 04:50.640
Yes, or any medium, yeah, it's truly like anyone can be a hero and all that stuff.

04:50.640 --> 04:55.240
And in fantasy role-playing, that's what you're drawn to, is the idea that you can

04:55.240 --> 05:00.040
be a hero, and yet the irony often is that you can take 10 minutes to open a door.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.040
Because you argue-

05:01.040 --> 05:03.240
I'm going to try my sword, I'm going to try this.

05:03.240 --> 05:09.960
And I think it's funny, and so the idea from the get-go was, or from the seesaw, you should

05:09.960 --> 05:10.960
have called it get-go.

05:10.960 --> 05:18.120
It'll remind people of auto insurance, they'll love it.

05:18.120 --> 05:25.040
By the way, Shapiro, what are you, are you an Avenger or just a self-loathing Jew?

05:25.040 --> 05:26.040
What?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.040
Shapiro.

05:27.040 --> 05:30.120
I've had many times I've been called a self-loathing Jew.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.120
Wait, why?

05:31.120 --> 05:32.120
Seriously?

05:32.120 --> 05:33.120
Yeah.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.920
It's a Philadelphia thing, if you're from the Delaware Valley or down there, everyone

05:36.920 --> 05:43.800
thinks you're like a high-flute, Levine, Levine, Einstein, it's really actually typical

05:43.800 --> 05:45.760
South Jersey white trash bullshit.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.040
Okay, now I get it.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.320
609, anyone?

05:49.320 --> 05:53.360
Not 69, 609, it's an area code inside.

05:53.360 --> 06:02.280
My grandparents on my mom's side, last name, now pronounced Riek, used to be Reich.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.360
Wow, you can see why they changed that.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.560
Uh-huh, yes I can, Mr. Shapiro.

06:06.560 --> 06:12.520
Yes, well played, let's all live in a masquerade.

06:12.520 --> 06:16.080
I'm supporting my father's family.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.640
As we all are.

06:17.640 --> 06:23.200
Anyways, where was I, yeah, we're launching a show, it's called Seasaw, it's $4 a month,

06:23.200 --> 06:29.720
oh shit, don't walk on the thing, it's a trap, there's nothing but dead Bengal tigers down

06:29.720 --> 06:30.720
there.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.720
Where'd it go?

06:31.720 --> 06:32.720
Name Seasaw.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.720
Seasaw.

06:33.720 --> 06:44.280
Okay, so it's, so that's it, I don't know, I pitched it to Amy Carlson at UCP, Universal

06:44.280 --> 06:48.360
Cable Productions, our production partner on this, and then we met on a teleconference.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.480
Yeah, because you came in subsequently.

06:50.480 --> 06:51.480
I had to sell you.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.480
I had to sell you.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.480
All right.

06:53.480 --> 06:58.200
On doing it with us, and one of the things that was on the interwebs this weekend is why

06:58.200 --> 07:02.880
you decided, why this place of all places to do it, and I don't know the answer to that

07:02.880 --> 07:07.200
question, so I answer, I ask it very risk-takingly.

07:07.200 --> 07:12.800
Because the budget was higher, because no one would ever, it wouldn't be on regular

07:12.800 --> 07:16.880
TV, it could have been a web thing, but it would have to be all animation.

07:16.880 --> 07:22.360
You said dinner for five, which you had a hand in creating, right?

07:22.360 --> 07:26.160
So the show will be, the animation isn't done, but we've shot the stuff.

07:26.160 --> 07:31.000
So what it is is like sort of dinner for five quality, Nathan Fillian sitting at a table

07:31.000 --> 07:37.600
with Spencer and myself, and Jeff Davis, and my now ex-wife, Erin McGathy, God damn it,

07:37.600 --> 07:38.600
distracting, distracting.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.600
You did that.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.040
No, it was the show, the show broke us up.

07:43.040 --> 07:48.160
You will hear from my lawyer, David Fleshmain.

07:48.160 --> 07:53.440
I thought, isn't it like, do we cheat him and how?

07:53.440 --> 07:55.960
Do we cheat him and who?

07:55.960 --> 07:57.200
It's all about the vowels.

07:57.200 --> 08:01.360
So it's Nathan and a bunch of other really cool people coming in.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.720
Celebrity guests, most of whom have shows on CISO.

08:03.720 --> 08:07.040
And then you roll the die, and you go into the fantasy role-playing, and then it animates.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.040
It's animation.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.040
It's like 80% animation.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.280
You promised me this beautiful animation.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.280
It's gonna be beautiful.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.400
Because I'm paying enough.

08:14.400 --> 08:20.760
So with that, thank you again for, it's nice, you should do a spit take.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.320
It's not beautiful.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.440
Thank you for coming.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.040
Thank you for bringing your crew.

08:26.040 --> 08:31.760
And with that, I will cede the stage to you and your, oh, do you mean leave it?

08:31.760 --> 08:37.680
Or side the stage to you and your Harmon Quest, Harmontown crew.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.680
All right.

08:38.680 --> 08:39.680
Great.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.680
Steve Jobs is dead.

08:40.680 --> 08:41.680
Long live Evan Shapiro.

08:41.680 --> 08:42.680
That dammit.

08:42.680 --> 08:43.680
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the SVA Theater.

08:43.680 --> 08:44.680
Am I correct about that?

08:44.680 --> 08:45.680
Which did?

08:45.680 --> 08:46.680
No?

08:46.680 --> 08:47.680
What's it called?

08:47.680 --> 08:48.680
SVA.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.680
What's this stand for?

08:49.680 --> 08:50.680
It's still a visual arts theater here somewhere in New York City.

08:50.680 --> 08:51.680
A very rare, special Harmontown is now in session.

08:51.680 --> 08:52.680
Please welcome Emerging Chetlee from his show, Harmontown.

08:52.680 --> 08:53.680
Welcome to the SVA Theater.

08:53.680 --> 09:22.680
The mayor of Harmontown, the star of Harmon Quest, Mr. Dan Harmon.

09:22.680 --> 09:29.680
The TV is the same as it used to be.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.680
There's going to be some changes.

09:31.680 --> 09:32.680
Okay.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.680
All right.

09:33.680 --> 09:34.680
That's fine.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.680
We can get the lights back up now.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.680
Everyone's a critic.

09:36.680 --> 09:37.680
All right.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.680
Literally, tonight, everyone's a critic.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.680
Oh, loud enough.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
I don't feel loud.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.680
Yeah.

09:41.680 --> 09:42.680
I mean...

09:42.680 --> 09:43.680
You don't feel loud either.

09:43.680 --> 09:44.680
No.

09:44.680 --> 09:45.680
And what the truth is, normally...

09:45.680 --> 09:46.680
We're used to being in a small, intimate space, doing this.

09:46.680 --> 09:47.680
We're used to more monitor, too.

09:47.680 --> 09:51.680
But I will say, when we were watching all the very funny content, the level's very low.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.680
It's like you should blast the people with the funny stuff.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
Are they...

09:55.680 --> 09:56.680
Okay.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.680
Someone's sarcastically turning it up now.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.680
There it is.

09:58.680 --> 09:59.680
There it is.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.680
Okay.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.680
Oh.

10:01.680 --> 10:02.680
Yeah.

10:02.680 --> 10:03.680
Okay.

10:03.680 --> 10:04.680
We got it.

10:04.680 --> 10:05.680
That's where it should have been.

10:05.680 --> 10:06.680
That cartoon was amazing.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.680
The Sinai thing.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.680
Very funny.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.680
That's intimidatingly funny.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.680
Has anyone pulled off a cartoon sketch show?

10:10.680 --> 10:11.680
Robot Chicken.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.680
All right.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.680
Different venue.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.680
That's why I do that.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.680
A competitor.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.680
All right.

10:16.680 --> 10:23.680
We don't have anything to talk about, so let's keep it moving.

10:23.680 --> 10:24.680
We have one thing to talk about.

10:24.680 --> 10:32.680
When you walked across this inch and a half piece of plywood, it bowed like a fiddle.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.680
Why would that be there?

10:34.680 --> 10:35.680
I don't know.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.680
That's insane.

10:36.680 --> 10:37.680
I don't want to talk about it.

10:37.680 --> 10:42.680
I was almost certain that was the end of my career, because without you, I'm nobody.

10:42.680 --> 10:46.680
I would be honored to die that way, but angry.

10:46.680 --> 10:51.680
But you said that beneath it is a pit full of dead bangle tigers.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.680
You'd land gently on a bunch of soft bangle tigers down there.

10:54.680 --> 11:00.680
Well, yeah, but even a dead bangle tiger, have you ever stepped on a dead bee?

11:00.680 --> 11:02.680
That's the only bee I've ever been stung by.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.680
I stepped on a dead bee on a beach.

11:04.680 --> 11:05.680
We'll talk about it later.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.680
How did you know it was dead when you stepped on it?

11:07.680 --> 11:08.680
You saw a dead bee?

11:08.680 --> 11:12.680
Well, because it didn't hurt as much as I had dreaded a bee sting would ever hurt.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.680
So I was like, that must have been just a dead bee.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.680
And I went back and the bee was dead.

11:17.680 --> 11:18.680
And I was like, I'm sorry.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.680
And he was like, fuck you.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.680
And like, I already died and then you stepped on me and I gave you what I could.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.680
And I was like, it felt like a little piece of glass.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.680
And he's like noted and he died.

11:29.680 --> 11:33.680
I lived my life serving an insectoid hive mind.

11:33.680 --> 11:38.680
By the way, the final joke is going to be on you, so did you.

11:38.680 --> 11:42.680
And I was like, whoa, bee, don't.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.680
Like, I'm a sentient primate.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.680
I'm going to live for 70 years.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.680
And he's like, just figure it out.

11:50.680 --> 11:54.680
This is the first time we've done a Harmontown since I went away for two and a half weeks.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.680
And while I was away, divorce.

11:56.680 --> 11:57.680
Yeah.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.680
But the bee was a big deal.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.680
I'll never forget that.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.680
I think you're using the bee to deflect from your real emotions right now.

12:05.680 --> 12:06.680
No, no, no.

12:06.680 --> 12:07.680
All right, let me look at my notes.

12:07.680 --> 12:08.680
See, now you're using your phone.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.680
It's a very classic Carmen.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.680
Well, we only have so much time.

12:12.680 --> 12:17.680
We have to give them a reader's digest version of our normally fast-paced show.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.680
Let's bring up Spencer Crittenden, the Game Master.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.680
Hell yeah!

12:22.680 --> 12:27.680
Just so that he's here when we...

12:27.680 --> 12:29.680
Oh, I want that music to be louder.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.680
There we go.

12:30.680 --> 12:37.680
We're getting there now.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.680
This is a mismatch here.

12:39.680 --> 12:45.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.680
I'm going to fall down.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.680
All right.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.680
Well, at least we got the mic stand.

12:51.680 --> 12:56.680
This is a school of visual arts.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.680
It's the golden age of TV.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.680
He's gone, but the content is...

13:00.680 --> 13:01.680
There's so many visual arts.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.680
For the front row, it's perfect perspective.

13:02.680 --> 13:06.680
You look like you're sitting down on a table right there for the front row.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.680
Okay.

13:07.680 --> 13:08.680
Is this going to work?

13:08.680 --> 13:09.680
No, it's not going to work.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.680
Okay, well, all right, let's start.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.680
We have to speed through my shit.

13:13.680 --> 13:14.680
Let's do a segment called...

13:14.680 --> 13:15.680
Do you have music cues?

13:15.680 --> 13:16.680
Kind of.

13:16.680 --> 13:17.680
I'm doing it off my phone.

13:17.680 --> 13:18.680
All right.

13:18.680 --> 13:19.680
What do you want?

13:19.680 --> 13:21.680
Let's do a segment called Divorce Advice Corner.

13:21.680 --> 13:22.680
Divorce Advice Corner.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.680
Hold up one second.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.680
Divorce Advice Corner.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.680
Yo.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.680
Divorce Advice.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.680
When you need it, it must be nice

13:32.680 --> 13:35.680
to give it, to see it, to receive it, to give it.

13:35.680 --> 13:36.680
Yo.

13:36.680 --> 13:37.680
You got to live it.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.680
Wrapping while making a drink.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.680
No.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.680
I'm just professional.

13:42.680 --> 13:43.680
The multitasking rapper.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.680
Yo.

13:44.680 --> 13:45.680
Yo.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.680
Multitasking.

13:46.680 --> 13:47.680
Rapper.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.680
I got an app called Slack for my team collaborations.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.680
It was a channel for each collaboration.

13:52.680 --> 13:56.680
Approximately all across the nation.

13:56.680 --> 13:57.680
What happened?

13:57.680 --> 13:59.680
Are we all going to die tonight?

13:59.680 --> 14:01.680
This is where we all die.

14:01.680 --> 14:06.680
It's a journey.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.680
That was...

14:07.680 --> 14:08.680
Yeah.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.680
Yeah.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.680
You're good, man.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.680
This is a pretty good show so far.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.680
This is a lot better than the last few.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.680
No.

14:16.680 --> 14:17.680
Yeah.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.680
It's not as good as the animated show.

14:18.680 --> 14:19.680
It's like a Swiss watch.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.680
But they had time to finish that, and we're just...

14:22.680 --> 14:23.680
Yeah.

14:23.680 --> 14:24.680
Yeah.

14:24.680 --> 14:25.680
Okay.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.680
Well, you thought my...

14:27.680 --> 14:28.680
No.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.680
My divorce advice corner is about...

14:30.680 --> 14:34.680
Please don't give me advice about my divorce.

14:34.680 --> 14:35.680
Most people...

14:35.680 --> 14:36.680
I was actually uplifted.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.680
My wife and I, we got married.

14:39.680 --> 14:43.680
We decided not to be married anymore.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.680
So there's two categories of people where you go like,

14:46.680 --> 14:48.680
you let people know, and it's weird.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.680
It always feels shameful.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.680
You feel like you spilled just jelly.

14:52.680 --> 14:53.680
Or something.

14:53.680 --> 14:54.680
Anything.

14:54.680 --> 14:55.680
Why do I...

14:55.680 --> 14:56.680
Anything.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.680
Nothing should be spilled.

14:57.680 --> 15:02.680
Let alone a lifetime together and 11 months after you threw a big party and said,

15:02.680 --> 15:07.680
I love God and her father, and I swear this one's for keeps.

15:07.680 --> 15:12.680
And then you're like, forget it.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.680
It feels shameful.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.680
It feels terrible.

15:14.680 --> 15:19.680
It's like joining the Boy Scouts and getting one yellow bead and then just being like,

15:19.680 --> 15:21.680
yeah, but I like computers.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.680
Do Boy Scouts get beads?

15:23.680 --> 15:24.680
What?

15:24.680 --> 15:25.680
Beads?

15:25.680 --> 15:26.680
Yeah, just don't get excited.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.680
They're just regular beads.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.680
Why?

15:28.680 --> 15:29.680
No, you wear them.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.680
You don't put them in your butt, Spencer.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.680
This guy loves beads in his butt.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.680
All right.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.680
I mean, sure, doesn't everybody...

15:38.680 --> 15:40.680
I mean, Boy Scouts do the...

15:40.680 --> 15:41.680
I don't think they get beads.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.680
Well, they did in the 80s.

15:43.680 --> 15:44.680
Yeah, whatever.

15:44.680 --> 15:48.680
Well, you think now they get like solar panels?

15:48.680 --> 15:51.680
Like monster energy drinks or something.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.680
They probably do get like a Pepsi.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.680
Yeah, they probably get like a TV and a scholarship to...

15:56.680 --> 15:58.680
What am I talking about?

15:58.680 --> 15:59.680
All right.

15:59.680 --> 16:05.680
So I'm just saying, like, so most people you go, like you broach the subject tenderly

16:05.680 --> 16:12.680
and you go, yeah, I don't know when to tell you this, but yeah, it's...

16:12.680 --> 16:14.680
And most people are like...

16:14.680 --> 16:18.680
It's kind of, you know, it's nice because you're already in a shameful place.

16:18.680 --> 16:23.680
And most people, they'll say, oh, I'm on my third, like, did you have kids?

16:23.680 --> 16:24.680
And you go, no.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.680
And they go, whew, dodged a bullet.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.680
Or they'll just go, like, yeah, it happens.

16:28.680 --> 16:29.680
It happens.

16:29.680 --> 16:34.680
And then there's that like 1% of people that are like, well, did you try to make it work?

16:34.680 --> 16:37.680
And most of those people, they know you the least.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.680
And it's like just strangers.

16:39.680 --> 16:40.680
They're like, don't...

16:40.680 --> 16:42.680
You're talking about yourself, obviously.

16:42.680 --> 16:46.680
Like, did you try?

16:46.680 --> 16:47.680
No, I didn't.

16:47.680 --> 16:51.680
I thought, you know, we just, we got married and then we thought, you know what would

16:51.680 --> 17:00.680
be fun and pleasurable and inexpensive and easy and the path of least resistance.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.680
And let's just do it without thinking about it.

17:03.680 --> 17:04.680
Let's get divorced.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.680
Like, we didn't think about it.

17:06.680 --> 17:07.680
Thank you so much.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.680
You asshole.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.680
You terrible, terrible person.

17:10.680 --> 17:17.680
Why is it that when married people hear that you're getting a divorce, some of them, not

17:17.680 --> 17:25.680
all of you, but they all feel like they're allowed to tell you that you made the wrong

17:25.680 --> 17:30.680
decision, but if divorced people tell married people the same thing, even though the divorce

17:30.680 --> 17:33.680
rate is like 80%, so there's way more of us.

17:33.680 --> 17:38.680
But if you tell, if someone says, I decided to get married and you say, I don't know about

17:38.680 --> 17:41.680
that, you're called a dick.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.680
So what are the rules that are applying?

17:43.680 --> 17:44.680
And it's always the same thing.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.680
It's like, oh, marriage is hard.

17:46.680 --> 17:47.680
Marriage takes work.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.680
So it's combat rules.

17:49.680 --> 17:53.680
It's like, if you're a veteran, you're allowed to talk about 9-11 more.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.680
Like, you're allowed to...

17:55.680 --> 18:01.680
Like, even if you're a reservist, even in any capacity, if you've ever worn a uniform,

18:01.680 --> 18:03.680
like, you're more of a hero, which is true.

18:03.680 --> 18:09.680
Like, you've volunteered yourself for, like, hard-ass, like, life-risking work.

18:09.680 --> 18:14.680
And so anybody that ever says, like, who knows if I should vote this time, Duke.

18:14.680 --> 18:19.680
And then Duke from G.I. Joe is like, hey, knowing it's half the battle.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.680
And you're like, okay, fuck, oh, shit.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.680
I can't argue with you.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.680
Just won't invite you next Christmas.

18:25.680 --> 18:33.680
But it's like, so if the rules apply, the same rules apply to combat as to marriage,

18:33.680 --> 18:36.680
why are you married?

18:36.680 --> 18:43.680
Because it's not a fight, and you should just get divorced.

18:43.680 --> 18:47.680
Just like combat rules.

18:47.680 --> 18:51.680
Well, no, in combat, if you're like, this is hard and you leave,

18:51.680 --> 18:54.680
that's called losing a war, which can have global repercussions.

18:54.680 --> 18:59.680
In marriage, if you're like, this is hard, we should leave, that's a victory.

18:59.680 --> 19:05.680
That's one of the two most beautiful things a couple can do in addition to giving married.

19:05.680 --> 19:10.680
Because it takes just as much bravery and just as much respect for the other person

19:10.680 --> 19:14.680
and just as much, like, I cried just as much.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.680
Like, it's like, it's a beautiful thing, and most of us do it.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.680
We get married and then we get divorced.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.680
Will you get married again, do you think?

19:22.680 --> 19:25.680
Yeah, three more times.

19:25.680 --> 19:31.680
No, my penis is a third nipple at this point, and I'm happy now.

19:31.680 --> 19:32.680
Some people like that.

19:32.680 --> 19:38.680
No, well, yeah, I mean, Evan Shapiro maybe, but like...

19:38.680 --> 19:42.680
It begs the question, what is sex and what is just an overall deal?

19:42.680 --> 19:45.680
I've been to...

19:45.680 --> 19:48.680
I'm into gals, but I want to make out what Evan Shapiro's hair.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.680
His hair is really good.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.680
That guy's hair?

19:52.680 --> 19:55.680
People are starting to mention it, it's becoming famous hair.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.680
I feel like it's by his design that it's becoming famous.

19:58.680 --> 20:02.680
I don't think there's a lot of work into it, but I think he's got something special going on.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.680
Alright, next segment.

20:04.680 --> 20:11.680
I'm saying he didn't have to go into creating TV special video demand platform thingies.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.680
He could have just been the hair model.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.680
Yeah, I know, he probably doesn't have to do anything.

20:15.680 --> 20:19.680
That means he must be really good at doing TV if he's...

20:19.680 --> 20:20.680
What?

20:20.680 --> 20:21.680
Go ahead.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.680
Oh, thank you.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.680
Alright, so, okay, well, I'm racist.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.680
I wanted to bring that up.

20:27.680 --> 20:32.680
Yo, I'm racist.

20:32.680 --> 20:36.680
Okay.

20:36.680 --> 20:37.680
I really am.

20:37.680 --> 20:38.680
It's official now because...

20:38.680 --> 20:40.680
I've never doubted that for a minute.

20:40.680 --> 20:43.680
Well, okay, I did, and now I'm like really...

20:43.680 --> 20:46.680
Well, yeah, like you said earlier today, you obsess about race,

20:46.680 --> 20:48.680
but what's the difference at some point?

20:48.680 --> 20:49.680
Right.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.680
You can cross a Rubicon of obsession about race.

20:52.680 --> 20:57.680
And I crossed it today because I was sitting at the hotel bar,

20:57.680 --> 21:02.680
and there's pictures on the wall of famous people that either stayed in the hotel or whatever,

21:02.680 --> 21:04.680
but it's like black and white photos.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.680
And so it's like...

21:05.680 --> 21:08.680
It all has this 60s vibe, and there's a guy laying in bed,

21:08.680 --> 21:11.680
and I was looking at the camera, and he's like,

21:11.680 --> 21:13.680
I just assumed it's just a wall of famous people,

21:13.680 --> 21:15.680
and I'm from LA, and so I'm just like,

21:15.680 --> 21:19.680
that's just pictures of famous people from the 60s that stayed here.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.680
And I was like, am I racist, or is that Morgan Freeman?

21:22.680 --> 21:26.680
And you're like, no, that's Jimi Hendrix.

21:26.680 --> 21:27.680
And I'm racist.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.680
I like that you think that Morgan Freeman stayed at that hotel in the 60s.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.680
I love that.

21:31.680 --> 21:32.680
Well, I mean, my mind also that Morgan Freeman...

21:32.680 --> 21:34.680
He was a full grown adult?

21:34.680 --> 21:35.680
I mean, he might have been.

21:35.680 --> 21:36.680
Maybe he probably was, yeah.

21:36.680 --> 21:37.680
I don't know.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.680
How old is Morgan Freeman?

21:40.680 --> 21:41.680
Old enough.

21:41.680 --> 21:42.680
Yeah.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.680
But that hotel wouldn't have been a boutique hotel back then.

21:44.680 --> 21:45.680
It would have been a flop.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.680
Yeah.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.680
Speaking of racism, that hotel is like...

21:49.680 --> 21:51.680
Also, the picture of all those paintings,

21:51.680 --> 21:53.680
if I can draw it out for you,

21:53.680 --> 21:54.680
there was what he thought was Morgan Freeman,

21:54.680 --> 21:57.680
surrounded by David Bowie, Mick Jagger,

21:57.680 --> 21:59.680
Rick Sinatra, Chet Baker,

21:59.680 --> 22:02.680
and a young Morgan Freeman laying in the bed.

22:02.680 --> 22:07.680
To be fair, a lot of those pictures I thought were Julian Assange

22:07.680 --> 22:10.680
and a friend of mine from high school.

22:10.680 --> 22:16.680
And I was like, I don't know, I go by like hats and eyebrows.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.680
I don't know.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.680
I'm happy to admit I'm racist.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.680
Not happy, I'm sad, but I also don't want to fight.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.680
But you're not a bigot.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.680
You don't believe that one race is better than the other,

22:28.680 --> 22:29.680
or some are worse than the other.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.680
I don't even think that's a tenable form of racism anymore.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.680
That's self-defeating racism.

22:34.680 --> 22:39.680
A true racist would simply hang back and notice race.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.680
And so I guess I'm one of them.

22:41.680 --> 22:42.680
I didn't want to be.

22:42.680 --> 22:43.680
I don't want to be.

22:43.680 --> 22:44.680
I hate it.

22:44.680 --> 22:47.680
I wish I could whip this white skin off my skeleton

22:47.680 --> 22:50.680
and throw it in the race garbage.

22:50.680 --> 22:54.680
And God will ensure that that happens.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.680
But in the meantime, I'm a holdover.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.680
I'm a strange skeleton in your museum.

22:59.680 --> 23:03.680
I'm like, race, notice her.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.680
That's it.

23:05.680 --> 23:06.680
I feel like you're hanging up about race.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.680
It's also that you're hanging up about men, women, me, you,

23:09.680 --> 23:11.680
the stranger, the friend.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.680
It's all about other.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.680
Not xenophobic is the word, maybe.

23:16.680 --> 23:20.680
But it's like strangers, you have a reaction to it.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.680
Anybody to the extent that they're different from you,

23:22.680 --> 23:26.680
especially visually, look at the look he's giving me right now.

23:26.680 --> 23:27.680
No, I'm live.

23:27.680 --> 23:31.680
But you have a reaction because you feel like it reflects on you

23:31.680 --> 23:32.680
in some way.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.680
You take an Asian guy walking into the room personally,

23:34.680 --> 23:37.680
not because you think that he's bad.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.680
Well, they're usually there to kill me.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.680
At my behest, I hired them to train me.

23:43.680 --> 23:47.680
Yes.

23:47.680 --> 23:48.680
Pink Panther.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.680
Thank you, Evan Shapiro, probably.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.680
I'm assuming that was Evan.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.680
He's a curator.

23:55.680 --> 23:59.680
Everyone else is like, date line, TMZ.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.680
He confirmed it.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.680
He's racist.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.680
This will get buried on page six for sure.

24:05.680 --> 24:08.680
What do I got to do to get on the front page?

24:08.680 --> 24:11.680
What were we talking about?

24:11.680 --> 24:15.680
Oh, so there's a lot of Germans in the hotel.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.680
Here we go.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.680
Here we go.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.680
I don't know if this is going to be a satisfying story.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.680
You're saying that there's a large German contingent dwelling

24:25.680 --> 24:27.680
in a hotel right now?

24:27.680 --> 24:31.680
I don't know if it's a ski team or something happening at the hotel.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.680
It could be a convention of bankers.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.680
It could be all sorts of things.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.680
I'm just saying that I'm walking around

24:39.680 --> 24:41.680
and I'm seeing a lot of blond people

24:41.680 --> 24:44.680
and I'm hearing like shogun, fugun, shogun shogun on the tower.

24:44.680 --> 24:47.680
Shogun, fugun, shogun, fugun, shogun shogun,

24:47.680 --> 24:50.680
maybe you're putting stuff on me.

24:50.680 --> 24:54.680
I came out of my hotel and I got to the elevator

24:54.680 --> 24:58.680
and there was a couple and they were waiting for the elevator, too.

24:58.680 --> 25:01.520
for the elevator too, but they hadn't pushed the button.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.240
And I don't know, if it's a German stereotype

25:04.240 --> 25:06.080
that they just thought that the elevator

25:06.080 --> 25:08.280
should heed their call, I don't know.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.480
That's not, I'm sure Germans are sick of that stereotype,

25:10.480 --> 25:12.280
but I pushed it for them.

25:12.280 --> 25:15.560
And then it, but while they were having

25:15.560 --> 25:17.120
this very hushed conversation, he was like,

25:17.120 --> 25:22.480
shingam, flim, shingam, flim, shimam, flim, flim, flim,

25:22.480 --> 25:24.080
and she's like, shingam, flim, flim,

25:24.080 --> 25:26.160
flim, flim, flim, shimam, flim, flim,

25:26.160 --> 25:28.240
and I'm like, okay, they're German, I think.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.160
There could be anything, there's 800 countries

25:30.160 --> 25:31.440
who cares about any of them.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.480
The, unless you're gonna bomb one,

25:33.480 --> 25:34.920
and then it's like, well, what do they have?

25:34.920 --> 25:37.480
The, but they get into the elevator,

25:37.480 --> 25:40.080
but he waits for her to get in,

25:40.080 --> 25:42.760
and then he waits for me to get in.

25:42.760 --> 25:45.920
So I'm like, all right, like some weird

25:45.920 --> 25:50.920
German emasculation technique, and I kind of step in.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.080
Oh, because he's letting you on.

25:52.080 --> 25:56.200
Well, he let his wife or a partner or a sister,

25:56.200 --> 25:58.640
but I don't know, I'm not assuming anything,

25:58.640 --> 26:00.000
but he let her on.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.760
By the way, according to,

26:06.360 --> 26:07.200
what is it, Tia?

26:07.200 --> 26:08.840
Don't say Himmler.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.720
No, the elevator, you would be surprised

26:12.720 --> 26:14.880
at what is actually etiquette for elevator.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.520
The old school etiquette, like back in the early days

26:16.520 --> 26:18.040
when elevators were a new thing,

26:18.040 --> 26:21.200
it was supposed to be that you let the men go on first

26:21.200 --> 26:23.640
in case it's going to fail, that they will be the ones

26:23.640 --> 26:24.480
that die.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.680
The etiquette hasn't been actually updated

26:26.680 --> 26:29.200
since elevators were dangerous.

26:29.200 --> 26:33.040
So it's actually, if you want to go by actual books

26:33.040 --> 26:34.760
that have been published on the topic,

26:34.760 --> 26:37.360
the actual etiquette is that a man is supposed

26:37.360 --> 26:42.360
to take the plunge and get onto this disastrous new laser

26:42.760 --> 26:46.000
transporter and plummet to his death.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.240
I don't like the one where,

26:47.240 --> 26:48.760
which is the one where the guy is supposed to walk

26:48.760 --> 26:50.960
closer to the curb than the woman,

26:50.960 --> 26:52.600
and they're like, some people say it's because-

26:52.600 --> 26:55.240
If it's uphill, and then in case his brake goes out,

26:55.240 --> 26:56.880
then he'll just like drift into-

26:56.880 --> 26:58.440
No, that's parking, that's parking.

26:58.440 --> 27:02.400
Yeah, you got to turn the woman into the-

27:02.400 --> 27:04.520
You have to turn the woman toward the curb,

27:04.520 --> 27:07.560
like her back, but everyone always turns her front

27:07.560 --> 27:08.400
toward the curb.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.120
Your woman is going to like slide into the street.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.040
That's like, and there could be a car chase

27:14.040 --> 27:16.240
if you're in San Francisco.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.400
Steve McQueen's coming to get you.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.920
Yeah, the French connection's going to happen

27:18.920 --> 27:20.320
and you just lost a woman.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.720
So I was like- I didn't know this.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.720
I was like, I don't know, 18, 17,

27:25.720 --> 27:26.880
and I was walking down the road,

27:26.880 --> 27:28.680
and I was, it had been raining out,

27:28.680 --> 27:32.600
so I was walking on the inside of like the,

27:32.600 --> 27:34.480
no, no, I was, what was I doing?

27:34.480 --> 27:38.840
No, no, she got mad at me for standing on the outside

27:38.840 --> 27:42.360
because that makes her look like a prostitute, right?

27:42.360 --> 27:43.600
Cause you're supposed to walk on the inside,

27:43.600 --> 27:45.240
or no, the opposite way around?

27:45.240 --> 27:46.960
I don't know, as puddles as prostitutes,

27:46.960 --> 27:48.480
I never figured it out.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.600
Yeah, look for Jeff's children's book.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.880
It's puddles and prostitutes,

27:53.880 --> 27:56.760
and you open each page and then you have the kid let go

27:56.760 --> 27:57.880
and he's supposed to guess.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.000
Is it a puddle or a prostitute?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.360
If you're a pimp, if you're a pimp-

28:00.360 --> 28:02.400
I'm collected from the heavens.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.360
Puddle, no, prostitute.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.360
World's oldest profession.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.120
I'm content with the lowest places.

28:10.120 --> 28:10.960
Puddle.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.960
Anyways, so I got in the elevator, and then it was just

28:12.960 --> 28:15.960
very quiet, I don't know if, I don't know if they were

28:15.960 --> 28:20.960
having a thing, like it was terse or if that's just German

28:21.480 --> 28:32.720
regular stuff, like, like, like, like.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.840
Did they, did they seem to be family or?

28:34.840 --> 28:38.240
Well, yeah, it's my perception, but I'm American,

28:38.240 --> 28:41.360
so my perception is that God should be on your money

28:41.360 --> 28:43.240
and everybody should go fuck themselves.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.200
My perception is fucking retarded.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.360
Oh, shit, god damn it.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.680
My perception is that that word, my sister's retarded,

28:50.680 --> 28:55.320
and she just, she just moved in with a woman

28:55.320 --> 28:58.040
and who used to be a man, so fuck all of you, I wrote it.

28:58.040 --> 29:02.560
All right, get out, get out, pull up, pull up.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.560
The show brought to you by a Bud Light.

29:04.560 --> 29:09.560
All right, the, it was terse in the elevator

29:10.240 --> 29:11.480
and I wasn't sure, I don't know,

29:11.480 --> 29:13.560
because there's a stereotype of the German people,

29:13.560 --> 29:16.160
I don't know, but they were quiet.

29:16.160 --> 29:19.800
But here's, and then so, then we ride down in silence

29:19.800 --> 29:24.800
and he's wearing like a ski jacket and she stared forward

29:24.800 --> 29:27.600
and he was sort of like 45 degree angle

29:27.600 --> 29:31.040
and I'm staring forward too and I'm at the door

29:31.040 --> 29:36.040
and it goes boom, boom, boom, lobby, opens up

29:38.840 --> 29:42.640
and it's just a pause and then she steps out

29:42.640 --> 29:43.880
and then I'm just waiting

29:43.880 --> 29:46.040
because now this thing happened up there

29:46.040 --> 29:49.240
and then I look over at him and he's facing

29:49.240 --> 29:53.040
and he goes like this, he goes please.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.680
And I fucked off, like it was like Hans Gruber,

29:59.680 --> 30:02.760
like please, he just gritted his teeth

30:02.760 --> 30:04.480
and closed his eyes, please.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.080
Give me three seconds away from her.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.680
No, no, no wonder they didn't laugh.

30:10.680 --> 30:12.000
They all thought some weird thing.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.280
No, I'm saying the guy was like,

30:13.280 --> 30:15.320
please get the fuck off the elevator.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.160
Oh, that's it.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.520
All right, not a good story then I guess.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.520
No, it doesn't matter.

30:18.520 --> 30:20.400
I was in the same elevator today,

30:20.400 --> 30:22.360
going up to my hotel room at the same hotel

30:22.360 --> 30:24.360
and there was a family of French people

30:24.360 --> 30:27.400
and they were clearly my mother, father and child.

30:27.400 --> 30:30.880
And I think there were two like teenage children

30:30.880 --> 30:32.240
and they were all like kind of giggling

30:32.240 --> 30:35.760
and laughing in French, which I only know a few words of.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.960
And they were kind of laughing

30:37.960 --> 30:40.440
and then I came in and hit my button

30:40.440 --> 30:42.200
but it didn't work, you had to put the card back in

30:42.200 --> 30:44.160
so the wife kept putting the card in

30:44.160 --> 30:45.320
and I kept hitting the button

30:45.320 --> 30:47.360
but then somebody would come in and like,

30:47.360 --> 30:48.360
oh, can I stop the elevator?

30:48.360 --> 30:49.600
We had to keep doing it.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.560
And so I kind of made a joke.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.440
Before I knew they were all French.

30:53.440 --> 30:54.280
I hadn't heard any French.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.680
So now we're going up and the guy goes,

30:55.680 --> 30:57.680
ah, he's in the CBD because I'm thinking

30:57.680 --> 30:59.680
he's a good pa.

30:59.680 --> 31:03.240
Which, that's what not, pa means not.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.080
Right.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.200
Yeah, so then they all kind of giggled

31:05.200 --> 31:08.000
and I kind of went, I kind of gave him a smile.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.040
Then they went quiet for a while

31:09.040 --> 31:11.000
and then he made another joke

31:11.000 --> 31:13.800
and they all kind of sheepishly giggled.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.560
I looked back around and I was like,

31:15.560 --> 31:19.280
eh, like kind of like, you know,

31:19.280 --> 31:20.400
I get it all the time or whatever

31:20.400 --> 31:22.240
because now they're talking about me.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.880
And it happens three times.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.120
I get off the elevator, I go,

31:25.120 --> 31:26.400
boss one and they're like, all right.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.400
Whoa, he knows.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.360
He knows everything we said.

31:30.360 --> 31:32.160
We were throwing him what we thought

31:32.160 --> 31:34.280
was cryptic French shade.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.920
Oh, look at this guy, he's wearing the jacket.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.200
He's wearing the shoes, he's wearing the socks,

31:40.200 --> 31:41.160
he's wearing the jacket.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.000
Not.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.360
And everyone's like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

31:46.360 --> 31:47.760
I think bread is breakfast.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.440
And yet we're thin, I don't know why.

31:54.440 --> 31:55.840
Well, it's probably because the bread

31:55.840 --> 32:00.000
isn't made by Tyson Foods, a big sponsor of CISO.

32:01.920 --> 32:05.160
They figured out how to make making bread inhumane.

32:05.160 --> 32:10.160
Tyson, there's just bigger factories full of bread.

32:10.760 --> 32:14.480
Like you thought yeast was beyond mistreatment,

32:14.480 --> 32:16.880
but you should see the videos, YouTube it.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.520
It's just guys like stabbing with toothpicks,

32:19.520 --> 32:21.480
just like, hey, yeast.

32:21.480 --> 32:23.200
And they're just like hitting the yeast

32:23.200 --> 32:25.400
and the yeast is like, ow, ow.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.000
Like they've found more things

32:27.000 --> 32:29.600
about yeast capacity for intelligence,

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
just from the abuse.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.920
They found out that yeast consume more sugars

32:32.920 --> 32:34.360
and give off more carbon dioxide

32:34.360 --> 32:36.000
if they're living in a state of terror.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Yes, and it's more delicious.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.440
Have you ever had a great cookie?

32:39.440 --> 32:41.320
That yeast died scared.

32:41.320 --> 32:46.320
So complain all you want, but I guess fuck Christmas.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.720
If, you know, I don't know.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.640
Like just think about it for a little bit.

32:50.640 --> 32:53.840
You're New Yorkers, you probably aren't familiar

32:53.840 --> 32:56.720
with complication or dichotomy.

32:58.920 --> 33:03.160
Hey, hey, this probably isn't like a new thing,

33:03.160 --> 33:08.160
but there was a country station playing on the thing.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.320
So country, so do we have any country,

33:11.320 --> 33:13.000
Western singers in here?

33:14.960 --> 33:17.640
Anybody here been in a country band?

33:17.640 --> 33:18.560
Country music?

33:18.560 --> 33:20.480
Yeah, it's not a big city for that, I guess,

33:20.480 --> 33:24.320
but I just want to, I just, I'm just parsing this.

33:24.320 --> 33:25.920
Like I, because I've never really paid attention.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.560
So the idea is I listen to three country songs in a row.

33:28.560 --> 33:33.560
So the idea is, so you love outlaws because you have to,

33:35.800 --> 33:39.600
but also the Bible because you have to,

33:40.360 --> 33:45.040
and chicken and beer because you have to,

33:45.040 --> 33:46.240
and then just freedom.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.040
But the freedom is the most important thing.

33:50.040 --> 33:55.040
The freedom to like the Bible and outlaws?

33:55.160 --> 33:58.000
Like what is the, I don't understand, like the,

33:58.000 --> 34:03.000
I like all my fans are outlaws and the outlaw style is here.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.680
We like to go shopping at Kmart.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.920
And like, I'm not the first person to point this out,

34:07.920 --> 34:09.880
but it's like, how could they be?

34:09.880 --> 34:13.520
So that's terrible, like I feel bad for them.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.360
They're like, I like, I'm on outlaw,

34:15.360 --> 34:17.840
but I like the Bible.

34:17.840 --> 34:20.920
Yeah, and the constitution, second amendment.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.680
But I like, and I like bad nutrition.

34:22.680 --> 34:24.040
And I like, I mean, I do too,

34:24.040 --> 34:26.280
but I don't consider that outlaw behavior.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.720
I consider that actually the moments

34:27.720 --> 34:29.280
when I'm most capitulating.

34:29.280 --> 34:31.920
How would you align yourself more of an outlaw or more?

34:31.920 --> 34:35.480
More of a, just a guy, I'm just like a pig at a trough.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.480
And I'm like proud of it.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.840
And I'm like, this is good.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.360
Like, like, like, like CISO, Suey, like, like, like,

34:41.360 --> 34:43.280
I just like, it's delicious.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.600
Like who made corn for me?

34:44.600 --> 34:45.720
I love being a pig.

34:45.720 --> 34:49.360
Like, I don't, I never go like, plus I'm an outlaw.

34:49.360 --> 34:51.000
Cause I would feel dumb if I did that.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.200
I think that would be dumb.

34:52.200 --> 34:54.160
Like, I don't think an outlaw should even be talking

34:54.160 --> 34:55.000
into a microphone.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.880
Like, like, like to an outlaw, he'd be like,

34:56.880 --> 34:58.960
why is this amplifying my voice?

34:58.960 --> 35:00.080
I'm an outlaw.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.880
I use, I use, I use lack of law to amplify my intent.

35:04.840 --> 35:08.080
I don't, it's like, like, like microphones are for politics.

35:08.080 --> 35:10.880
They're for guys with big giant mustaches with grease in them.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.800
Like, like the people that put up telephone poles.

35:12.800 --> 35:13.640
I'm an outlaw.

35:13.640 --> 35:16.920
I'm an outlaw, I love, I love not being in the law.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.280
But I love the Bible.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.480
Like, like the Bible, like I love the Bible.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.640
Like the Bible is like all law.

35:22.640 --> 35:24.760
Like it's like the, like it's more laws

35:24.760 --> 35:26.200
than even just our laws.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.840
But it's, like, it's more laws.

35:27.840 --> 35:29.760
There's laws in the Bible that aren't even law.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.600
The new, the new.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.440
Extra laws.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.080
Like, like, you know, remember the kid that was like,

35:33.080 --> 35:34.760
loved math in school and he's like, I can't,

35:34.760 --> 35:37.280
I'm gonna spend the summer doing math stuff.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.400
That's what the Bible is.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.360
It's like extra law.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.960
But it's like laws that don't even make sense.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.280
The protagonist of the New Testament is an outlaw.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.760
He's, he's wanted by the popos.

35:45.760 --> 35:48.040
Yeah, but then there's a whole Bible about him.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.520
Like they added him to the Bible because he did that.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.520
Is that what they're hoping?

35:51.520 --> 35:52.640
There's going to be a third Testament

35:52.640 --> 35:53.680
with Waylon Jennings in it.

35:53.680 --> 35:57.200
Like, I was like, oh, this is how you do it.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.880
I'm an outlaw, I'm an outlaw.

35:58.880 --> 36:01.160
How come no one's crucifying me?

36:01.160 --> 36:02.000
Yeah.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.560
I want to throw on a Bible about me.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.960
About how I went shopping and fuck those shits.

36:07.960 --> 36:11.640
I'm a, I want a Bible about me.

36:11.640 --> 36:14.360
Well, you're going to have to learn more chords.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.560
Yeah.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.360
First of all, by my definition,

36:17.360 --> 36:18.640
you have to learn more chords.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.040
Maybe the dance moves could use a little punch up.

36:23.720 --> 36:24.560
How are we doing on time?

36:24.560 --> 36:26.000
Have I filled a half hour?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.760
I think, I don't know what exactly you and I could.

36:27.760 --> 36:31.280
No, my goal is to fill a half hour.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.520
I think we're quite close actually to going on

36:33.520 --> 36:36.280
to the second segment of our Capulcate of Stars tonight.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.880
Okay, two more fun anecdotes about my personal life,

36:38.880 --> 36:40.720
which is very uneventful.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.960
I got into the elevator another time.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.720
This is what I do when I come to New York.

36:46.720 --> 36:49.400
This show is a rich tapestry of ideas.

36:50.120 --> 36:54.760
And I, my room is, I'm not even going to change the numbers.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.440
If you want to come kill me, just come kill me.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.400
My, because I wouldn't know how to riff

36:59.400 --> 37:01.600
a palindromic number like this.

37:01.600 --> 37:05.680
I, my room is 611, but I got the thing and it's upside down.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.960
It's, I thought, I thought I was in room 119.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.760
So I'm like, wait, one, I've never been,

37:09.760 --> 37:10.840
so it's, it's New York.

37:10.840 --> 37:13.160
I bet the one is like up because it's New York,

37:13.160 --> 37:14.240
because everything's vertical.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.600
Like you go to Walgreens and it's like,

37:15.600 --> 37:17.800
vitamins are 30 miles in the sky.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.680
The, the, so I was like, I got in the elevator

37:20.680 --> 37:22.000
and there was just two women in there

37:22.000 --> 37:23.080
and I was just like, I don't know.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.200
There's no one button.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.920
And then like it opened on four

37:25.920 --> 37:28.120
and there was just some kid with like a luggage rack.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.880
And, and I said, hey, hi, how'd it work?

37:31.880 --> 37:34.800
Would you mind, how do you, how do you get to one?

37:34.800 --> 37:35.640
And he's like, what?

37:35.640 --> 37:37.640
And I'm like, what did, what, 119?

37:37.640 --> 37:38.760
I don't know where to go.

37:38.760 --> 37:39.960
And I held up the thing and he's like,

37:39.960 --> 37:43.000
I think that's 6'11 and I turned it upside down

37:43.000 --> 37:44.960
and I was like, ah, and the door's closed

37:44.960 --> 37:47.640
and I turned to the ladies having been raised

37:47.640 --> 37:50.600
on television and movies and I said, I don't get out much.

37:50.600 --> 37:54.400
So like, if you don't get out much,

37:54.400 --> 37:57.080
the one thing that you might be adept at

37:57.080 --> 37:59.480
is number reading.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.920
That's the one thing you can practice

38:00.920 --> 38:02.760
without getting out much.

38:02.760 --> 38:03.720
I just saw that was funny.

38:03.720 --> 38:04.800
I don't get out much.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.320
Yeah, you don't get out so much

38:06.320 --> 38:08.520
that you use the line, I don't get out much.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.920
And you think that that's just gonna like make sense

38:10.920 --> 38:11.760
and it doesn't.

38:11.760 --> 38:12.600
They're French.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.760
They're like, and the other one was like,

38:14.760 --> 38:17.320
I'm gonna suck up, and the other one was like,

38:17.320 --> 38:18.160
I surrender.

38:19.240 --> 38:21.120
And I was like, I'll step in,

38:21.120 --> 38:23.200
but it's gonna cost you $70 trillion.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.240
It's part of a 50 year plan.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.080
Don't worry, we'll be done by 99.

38:30.320 --> 38:35.320
Okay, I'm racist, divorce, Germans, country,

38:35.320 --> 38:38.120
brundle fly, whatever.

38:38.120 --> 38:40.680
I want a brundle fly.

38:40.680 --> 38:41.760
Oh, there was a guy.

38:41.760 --> 38:45.120
I was driving with the car driver.

38:45.120 --> 38:45.960
What do you call him?

38:45.960 --> 38:47.280
Drivers.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.320
You never have to specify the vehicle.

38:49.320 --> 38:50.720
I didn't come here in a truck.

38:52.320 --> 38:55.240
And he said, he was driving,

38:55.240 --> 38:56.920
I don't know, this is not, this is not,

38:56.920 --> 38:58.680
like he was driving like this,

38:58.680 --> 39:01.080
like a little tiny steering wheel holding a phone.

39:01.080 --> 39:04.080
He went, it was silent, it was just driving,

39:04.080 --> 39:06.080
and then he was like driving for a while.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.640
And I was really, I was just on this huge New York high,

39:08.640 --> 39:10.000
because by the way, my new,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.560
like this last six visits to York,

39:12.560 --> 39:14.880
I'm like, wait a minute,

39:14.880 --> 39:17.120
New York's gimmick is that everyone's friendly.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.520
Like it's not, it used to,

39:18.520 --> 39:20.600
it was like an 80s thing that was like,

39:20.600 --> 39:22.720
oh, it's the, oh, everyone's so rude,

39:22.720 --> 39:23.640
and they have so much to do,

39:23.640 --> 39:24.920
they don't have time to be polite.

39:24.920 --> 39:27.120
No, it's the city where they all live together,

39:27.120 --> 39:29.040
so they're like all much more socially adept

39:29.040 --> 39:30.040
than everyone that comes here,

39:30.040 --> 39:31.600
and you're always like leaving here going like,

39:31.600 --> 39:32.600
wow, that was really nice.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.800
Everyone's like really friendly and has like character,

39:34.800 --> 39:37.040
and even the mean people are mean, but with an eye patch,

39:37.040 --> 39:39.520
and like, everyone's got a gimmick,

39:39.520 --> 39:41.000
like they live on top of each other,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.200
they're like, they can't afford to have like issues,

39:43.200 --> 39:44.720
I mean, no, they can't have issues,

39:44.720 --> 39:46.000
but they're like color form issues.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.800
It's like, I'm gonna take these issues,

39:47.800 --> 39:49.560
and they're good people, they're fun,

39:49.560 --> 39:51.640
and they're nice, and I'm gonna collect them all.

39:51.640 --> 39:55.040
The, but I was on this big New York high,

39:55.040 --> 39:57.120
and then I got into the car,

39:57.120 --> 39:58.200
and then the guy's driving,

39:58.200 --> 39:59.360
and it was like kind of silent,

39:59.360 --> 40:01.840
and I'm kind of, I was exhausted with New York love.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.400
I was like, I was like, ah, I'm so tired

40:03.400 --> 40:05.320
of talking about how much I love New York.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.440
So I was just quiet, and then the driver went,

40:08.440 --> 40:10.840
because I was quiet, and he's like,

40:10.840 --> 40:14.480
you know, and I wrote it down, so I'm reading it.

40:14.480 --> 40:18.360
I was driving this producer one time, Todd Black,

40:18.360 --> 40:20.880
and he said, you know, I don't know how it is,

40:20.880 --> 40:24.520
you do what you do, silence.

40:24.520 --> 40:28.520
And I was like, well, now I hate New York,

40:28.520 --> 40:32.360
and I know how you do what you do,

40:32.360 --> 40:34.600
you press the gas pedal and the light turns green,

40:34.600 --> 40:36.920
and I mean, I know the traffic's bad,

40:36.920 --> 40:39.840
but don't suck your own dick about it, like that's crazy.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.440
You're not a hero, that's not,

40:41.440 --> 40:43.720
that's the, he would have been if,

40:43.720 --> 40:45.880
I mean, I'm sure Todd Black met him on a day

40:45.880 --> 40:48.720
when he didn't do that, and then Todd Black was like,

40:48.720 --> 40:50.400
you're great, I don't know how you do what you do,

40:50.400 --> 40:51.520
and he's like, I'm gonna remember that,

40:51.520 --> 40:52.560
and then I got in the car, and he's like,

40:52.560 --> 40:53.880
you know what Todd Black said to me,

40:53.880 --> 40:57.160
and I'm like, well, now he shouldn't have, you know?

40:57.160 --> 40:59.920
I'm not sure I know what his angle was

40:59.920 --> 41:01.960
or your angle is on this one, is he saying,

41:01.960 --> 41:03.200
oh, you're like all those producers,

41:03.200 --> 41:05.560
you're condescending, I don't know how you do what you do.

41:05.560 --> 41:06.760
No, it was like, there was silence,

41:06.760 --> 41:09.760
and he was like, this is that moment when someone

41:09.760 --> 41:13.200
congenializes with me, and it's not happening,

41:13.200 --> 41:16.160
so he was like, you know, it's funny, you should ask,

41:16.160 --> 41:19.640
I am kind of a hero, and I'm like, I didn't,

41:19.640 --> 41:21.880
I was about to maybe come around to saying that

41:21.880 --> 41:24.000
after I caught my breath from buying a jacket,

41:24.000 --> 41:27.240
and now you're an enemy, and I hate your whole city.

41:28.560 --> 41:29.640
Hate everyone in it.

41:31.040 --> 41:32.480
Yeah.

41:32.480 --> 41:33.640
Should we request?

41:33.640 --> 41:36.400
No, no, no, let me do a rap about how I hate New York.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.560
Let me hit him at their most sensitive element.

41:39.560 --> 41:43.440
Yo, I hate your city, I hate your city,

41:43.440 --> 41:46.400
like a dude hates a kitty, he puts it in his mouth

41:46.400 --> 41:48.800
from the north to the south, gonna suck the milk

41:48.800 --> 41:51.840
like it was silk, these raps are bad,

41:51.840 --> 41:54.360
but New York, you've been had,

41:54.360 --> 41:56.160
you've been told you're better than Boston,

41:56.160 --> 42:00.400
and Vermont, that's a state, what do you want from a guy?

42:00.400 --> 42:02.760
Just not made to rap, I'm gonna fuck you,

42:02.760 --> 42:07.760
Mara, like crap, the boot goes in her butt, you're pressed.

42:08.120 --> 42:08.960
So what?

42:08.960 --> 42:11.640
CISO is the place to pee,

42:11.640 --> 42:14.640
$3 a month for comedy, I burnt your mama

42:14.640 --> 42:18.200
till she started to pee, I put a glass in a drank in town,

42:18.200 --> 42:21.880
and I said, turn that frown upside down,

42:21.880 --> 42:24.360
and I put it in the fridge, and I took your mama

42:24.360 --> 42:25.800
to the tunnel in the fridge,

42:25.800 --> 42:28.280
that's an expression you guys use in this town.

42:28.280 --> 42:33.280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

42:35.080 --> 42:35.920
Where you going?

42:35.920 --> 42:36.760
Where you going?

42:36.760 --> 42:38.280
Where the fuck are you going?

42:38.280 --> 42:41.640
No, that guy's got a show on CISO, he's leaving,

42:41.640 --> 42:44.440
he does whatever the shows are not promoting,

42:44.440 --> 42:49.040
it's called Collecting Matches, there's like,

42:49.040 --> 42:50.920
there's tears, they don't tell you,

42:50.920 --> 42:52.640
there's like tears of shows, there's like,

42:52.640 --> 42:54.200
they're good cartoon, and then there's my show,

42:54.200 --> 42:55.280
and then they're like, at the bottom,

42:55.280 --> 42:58.360
it's like $5,000 an episode, that guy's name is David Jenkins,

42:58.360 --> 43:00.760
he's got a show called Collecting Matches,

43:00.760 --> 43:04.680
it's not even a take, it's just he literally collects matches,

43:04.680 --> 43:06.280
like because it's a tax write off,

43:06.280 --> 43:08.160
if they have a certain amount of shows launched,

43:08.160 --> 43:11.000
it was like, like, like, how many do you have now, 700?

43:11.000 --> 43:12.040
Do you have any matches?

43:12.040 --> 43:17.040
No, see, that's the whole episode, he just asks that,

43:17.480 --> 43:21.000
that's all he does, no I don't, no one does,

43:21.000 --> 43:22.200
why would anyone have matches,

43:22.200 --> 43:26.160
the smoking's practically illegal, we're not outside,

43:26.160 --> 43:27.360
it's a terrible show.

43:27.360 --> 43:28.640
He's an outlaw.

43:28.640 --> 43:33.640
He's not an outlaw, he's an outlaw too,

43:33.680 --> 43:37.680
like Australopithecine, because he can make fire,

43:37.680 --> 43:38.760
which is against the law,

43:38.760 --> 43:40.760
because they probably had a God that was supposed

43:40.760 --> 43:42.040
to do that, lightning.

43:42.040 --> 43:43.360
It's time to move on to our second segment.

43:43.360 --> 43:44.440
Okay, all right, all right,

43:44.440 --> 43:46.160
so we're gonna create a division here,

43:46.160 --> 43:50.440
that was just for press release,

43:51.760 --> 43:55.760
just that was just for TMZ and BuzzFeed,

43:55.760 --> 43:58.080
and now we're gonna give you a sneak preview

43:58.080 --> 44:02.200
of our Harmon Quest content, right?

44:02.200 --> 44:03.240
That's what we're doing.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.560
We're doing the live portion of what will later,

44:05.560 --> 44:07.960
what would later on be animated?

44:07.960 --> 44:12.000
Right, we're gonna play a fantasy role-playing game

44:12.000 --> 44:13.200
with celebrity guests.

44:13.200 --> 44:14.640
Well Ethan Ficksell and David Dute,

44:14.640 --> 44:16.040
come on stage please.

44:16.040 --> 44:21.680
Yeah, I know what you're thinking,

44:21.680 --> 44:23.280
why aren't the, no God damn it,

44:23.280 --> 44:25.960
don't step on the fucking, although it's been tested

44:25.960 --> 44:27.880
for eight, eight years.

44:29.360 --> 44:30.440
You have another mic?

44:30.440 --> 44:32.560
Yeah, I think we're down a mic.

44:32.560 --> 44:35.280
Oh, there it is, cool.

44:35.280 --> 44:36.560
All right, Dave and Ethan.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.400
Yeah.

44:37.400 --> 44:38.920
Dave and Ethan, everybody.

44:38.920 --> 44:39.760
All right.

44:39.760 --> 44:40.600
Stop it.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.240
Come on, come on, mom.

44:45.440 --> 44:50.120
You guys all know which ones Dave,

44:51.160 --> 44:52.000
point at them.

44:53.080 --> 44:53.920
The hot one.

44:53.920 --> 44:54.760
The sweater.

44:54.760 --> 44:55.600
It's the hot one.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.360
And you know which ones Ethan,

44:57.360 --> 44:58.440
it's the checkered shirt one.

44:58.440 --> 44:59.280
That's me.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.120
All right, good.

45:00.120 --> 45:00.960
Okay.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.840
I tried to sit, but I didn't know if it was allowed

45:02.840 --> 45:03.680
to sit or not.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.400
No, no, no, no, I don't sit until he said it.

45:05.400 --> 45:07.200
No, take a load off, it's been a hard night.

45:07.200 --> 45:08.040
No, no, no, no.

45:08.040 --> 45:08.880
Okay.

45:08.880 --> 45:09.720
Oh, okay.

45:09.720 --> 45:10.560
No, no, not toward me.

45:10.560 --> 45:11.400
Okay, all right.

45:11.400 --> 45:12.760
I'll just go fuck myself.

45:12.760 --> 45:14.440
Okay, I'm sorry.

45:14.440 --> 45:15.280
Here we go.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.120
We're good.

45:16.120 --> 45:18.960
Okay, so we're gonna play a half hour.

45:18.960 --> 45:19.800
Okay.

45:19.800 --> 45:20.640
Yeah.

45:20.640 --> 45:22.640
Just to make sure, do we have a half hour?

45:22.640 --> 45:24.320
We've gone very long already.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.160
Yeah.

45:25.160 --> 45:28.520
What time do we need to plug it off into the night?

45:28.520 --> 45:30.720
People wanna get up and go pee and drink

45:30.720 --> 45:31.560
at some point, I imagine.

45:31.560 --> 45:32.520
Don't convince them of that.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.000
No, nobody does.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.040
You would say, oh yeah, there you are.

45:36.040 --> 45:38.280
But they don't have TV shows.

45:38.280 --> 45:40.600
I mean, use your voice if you have information for us.

45:40.600 --> 45:41.440
Let us know.

45:41.440 --> 45:42.280
We've got 10 minutes.

45:42.280 --> 45:43.120
We've got 10 minutes.

45:43.120 --> 45:43.960
We've been lightning around.

45:43.960 --> 45:44.800
Oh, really?

45:44.800 --> 45:45.620
I've got a question.

45:45.620 --> 45:46.920
David Ethan, if never in my knowledge,

45:46.920 --> 45:51.920
you guys are not D&D or role-playing aficionados, right?

45:53.920 --> 45:54.760
No, no.

45:54.760 --> 45:55.600
Okay, good.

45:55.600 --> 45:56.440
This is perfect, because some of the people

45:56.440 --> 45:59.240
that were on our show had not ever played it before.

45:59.240 --> 46:02.520
So Spencer will lead us off

46:02.520 --> 46:05.440
with one of Spencer's fantastic intros.

46:05.440 --> 46:06.880
Well, no, you won't.

46:06.880 --> 46:08.080
I don't know why you think that.

46:08.080 --> 46:09.160
Oh, you won't?

46:09.160 --> 46:12.560
Yeah, the thing is, this is a standalone story.

46:12.560 --> 46:15.640
It's like a microcosm of what we're gonna bring to you.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.640
But what we're going to bring to you with Harmon Quest

46:17.640 --> 46:19.820
is actually, it's been written by me

46:19.820 --> 46:22.720
in terms of the D&D story.

46:22.720 --> 46:25.280
And I had all this time to prepare.

46:25.280 --> 46:28.640
But this is like a 10 minute attempt

46:28.640 --> 46:31.560
at recapturing that magic without any

46:31.560 --> 46:33.480
of the expertise or prep work.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.320
So we're set up for success here is what you're saying.

46:35.320 --> 46:36.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.000
It's gonna be a slam dunk.

46:37.000 --> 46:37.840
It's gonna be the best 10 minutes.

46:37.840 --> 46:39.200
Spencer, do you want Spencer's music?

46:39.200 --> 46:41.440
Is there anybody here that needs anything

46:41.440 --> 46:43.200
to be undercut in any way?

46:44.080 --> 46:45.560
I just want to set everyone's,

46:45.560 --> 46:47.720
we record for an hour.

46:47.720 --> 46:48.840
We've all done it.

46:48.840 --> 46:51.080
We record for an hour and we cut it down to 20 minutes.

46:51.080 --> 46:53.080
Here, you're gonna see us play only 10 minutes.

46:53.080 --> 46:54.560
So figure it out.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.120
He takes it seriously is the point.

46:58.120 --> 46:59.760
Yeah, no, that's my job.

46:59.760 --> 47:03.240
You saw that documentary about the guy that dreams of sushi

47:03.240 --> 47:05.480
and then makes a really high maintenance meal for you.

47:05.480 --> 47:06.840
And it costs $700.

47:06.840 --> 47:08.000
And the whole time you're sitting there going,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.080
I hope I don't eat this wrong.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.760
It's artisanal.

47:11.760 --> 47:13.800
I should charge $700 for this.

47:13.800 --> 47:15.560
That's insane.

47:15.560 --> 47:17.640
Is that really what you pay for sushi?

47:17.640 --> 47:18.480
Yeah.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.080
You guys are fucking idiots.

47:20.080 --> 47:20.920
I'm sure it's.

47:22.120 --> 47:22.960
All right, so.

47:22.960 --> 47:23.800
So now we get, we get sheets.

47:23.800 --> 47:24.800
Just go top to bottom.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.640
Top to bottom.

47:25.640 --> 47:26.480
We have eight minutes left of this.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.680
Yeah, that's what I'm just.

47:28.680 --> 47:32.440
I mean, yeah, that's a little bit, it'll be great.

47:32.440 --> 47:35.080
We'll get a chance to start.

47:35.080 --> 47:36.560
Then we'll go party.

47:36.560 --> 47:37.400
Oh my gosh.

47:37.400 --> 47:38.240
All right.

47:38.240 --> 47:39.060
I'm just gonna start.

47:39.060 --> 47:39.900
Okay.

47:39.900 --> 47:41.720
Dan, you're playing a character named Fondue.

47:41.720 --> 47:43.520
Jeff, you're playing a character named Bone Weevil.

47:43.520 --> 47:44.360
I can do it.

47:44.360 --> 47:45.200
Bone Weevil.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.480
Fondue and Bone Weevil.

47:46.480 --> 47:48.840
You're at the Earthscar Ale House,

47:48.840 --> 47:51.600
the local tavern around these parts.

47:51.600 --> 47:53.760
It's a dreary place for the lost souls

47:53.760 --> 47:56.720
that wander through town enjoying the strong bruise

47:56.720 --> 47:58.080
in dark corners.

47:58.080 --> 47:59.680
You're sad at the bar.

48:00.720 --> 48:01.840
Hey, Fondue.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.680
Whoa.

48:02.680 --> 48:03.560
I'm really drunk.

48:03.560 --> 48:05.040
I'm really drunk right now.

48:05.040 --> 48:05.880
Do I know him?

48:05.880 --> 48:06.700
Yeah.

48:06.700 --> 48:07.540
Hey.

48:07.540 --> 48:08.360
What do you mean?

48:08.360 --> 48:09.200
Do you know me?

48:09.200 --> 48:10.040
I wasn't talking to you.

48:10.040 --> 48:10.880
You know me.

48:10.880 --> 48:11.720
I didn't say that out loud.

48:11.720 --> 48:12.560
Huh?

48:12.560 --> 48:13.400
Dude.

48:14.520 --> 48:15.360
All right.

48:16.760 --> 48:18.040
I mean, we don't know each other well,

48:18.040 --> 48:20.000
but we come to the same bar all the time.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.960
We speak, but you're always in a blackout drunk.

48:21.960 --> 48:22.800
You're a giant.

48:22.800 --> 48:23.920
What are you, a half-orc or something?

48:23.920 --> 48:24.920
Yeah.

48:24.920 --> 48:25.760
Yeah.

48:25.760 --> 48:27.080
Look, I'm just a little goblin.

48:27.080 --> 48:29.760
I'm just a little, probably what, three feet?

48:29.760 --> 48:32.560
But your conversation is interrupted by the arrival

48:32.560 --> 48:33.600
of two gentlemen.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.440
Oh, shit.

48:34.440 --> 48:35.280
Oh.

48:35.280 --> 48:39.240
You see two brothers with matching facial tattoos.

48:39.240 --> 48:40.440
Actually, they're not brothers.

48:40.440 --> 48:42.120
They're clearly of different races.

48:42.120 --> 48:44.360
One's a half-orc and one's an elf.

48:44.360 --> 48:45.200
Oh.

48:45.200 --> 48:46.040
Oh.

48:46.040 --> 48:46.880
Hark, harkin.

48:46.880 --> 48:47.720
Is that, do we say that?

48:47.720 --> 48:48.560
Yeah.

48:48.560 --> 48:49.400
Hark, hark, hello.

48:49.400 --> 48:50.480
Hark, harkin, hello.

48:50.480 --> 48:53.480
We are seeking the crown of the rat king,

48:53.480 --> 48:57.600
which might be found in the tomb of the rat king.

48:57.600 --> 49:01.160
For I am divorceeous.

49:01.160 --> 49:05.400
And I am, it's for the bestiest.

49:05.400 --> 49:05.880
Wow.

49:05.880 --> 49:07.320
Yes.

49:07.320 --> 49:09.560
Guys, I pulled them aside and I go,

49:09.560 --> 49:13.880
whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

49:13.880 --> 49:18.120
Do you know where the rat king tomb be?

49:18.120 --> 49:23.840
I have heard that it is in the tomb of the rat king.

49:23.840 --> 49:26.000
That's what I heard.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
But Joe Smigeggy told me.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.960
I use my knowledge of nature or the local area.

49:32.960 --> 49:34.560
Do I know where the rat tomb is, Spencer?

49:34.560 --> 49:35.000
Oh, yeah.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.320
No, everybody knows that the tomb of the rat king

49:37.320 --> 49:39.680
is in the forest outside of town.

49:39.680 --> 49:42.960
I say we put our drinks down and get the hell over there.

49:42.960 --> 49:44.680
And what are we looking for again in the thing?

49:44.680 --> 49:47.440
We're trying to find the crown of the rat king.

49:47.440 --> 49:50.440
And when we get there, we're going to split the money.

49:50.440 --> 49:51.120
Yeah.

49:51.120 --> 49:51.760
OK.

49:51.760 --> 49:53.760
OK, now it's good to say these things.

49:53.760 --> 49:54.480
It's like a divorce.

49:54.480 --> 49:57.200
You want to get this stuff set up before you get into it.

49:57.200 --> 49:59.440
It's like a prenup for an adventure.

49:59.440 --> 50:00.440
Right.

50:00.440 --> 50:03.200
Well, normally, there'd be more of a refusal of the call,

50:03.200 --> 50:04.560
which would result in immersiveness,

50:04.560 --> 50:05.960
but this is more like a porno.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.960
So let's just quit.

50:07.960 --> 50:08.920
My synth's clogged.

50:08.920 --> 50:09.440
Let's front.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.040
No, no, no, no, no.

50:10.040 --> 50:10.720
All right.

50:10.720 --> 50:12.920
Front do, front refuse the call.

50:12.920 --> 50:14.400
I don't know if I should do it.

50:14.400 --> 50:15.680
All right, let's go.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.480
Yeah, yeah.

50:17.480 --> 50:20.160
He reads my eyes.

50:20.160 --> 50:25.760
I have a wagon outside with a couple mules.

50:25.760 --> 50:26.920
You just want to get in my wagon?

50:26.920 --> 50:29.200
How many wheels does this wagon have?

50:29.200 --> 50:30.240
It's a two-wheeled wagon.

50:30.240 --> 50:31.240
It's not a great wagon.

50:31.240 --> 50:34.040
It's what horses are the front wheels, basically.

50:34.040 --> 50:35.400
We're not used to those.

50:35.400 --> 50:36.680
Do you have horse-wield wagons?

50:36.680 --> 50:39.320
No, the horses work as front wheels.

50:39.320 --> 50:42.560
Two wheels just fall over, but the horses hold it up.

50:42.560 --> 50:44.520
Is there a safety harness on this wagon

50:44.520 --> 50:45.400
to ensure that I do it?

50:45.400 --> 50:46.680
Otherwise, the things would fall off.

50:46.680 --> 50:48.640
I say we get in it for the money shot.

50:48.640 --> 50:49.200
Let's go.

50:49.200 --> 50:49.800
Let's do it.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.240
We shall go for the shot of money.

50:51.240 --> 50:55.000
I have a few more questions about the safety

50:55.000 --> 50:56.080
features of this wagon.

50:56.080 --> 50:58.480
Hey, should we collide with a tree?

50:58.480 --> 51:00.320
You already refused the call back in the bar.

51:00.320 --> 51:01.800
You don't get to refuse the wagon.

51:01.800 --> 51:03.560
All right, I'll get in the wagon.

51:03.560 --> 51:04.440
Yeah, mules.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.680
Oh, whoa.

51:06.680 --> 51:07.280
Wow.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.600
Right, pretty smooth, doesn't it?

51:08.600 --> 51:09.280
Yeah, pretty smooth.

51:09.280 --> 51:10.280
Two-wheeled affair.

51:10.280 --> 51:12.600
How do you reach the, you're so small.

51:12.600 --> 51:13.840
How do you reach the?

51:13.840 --> 51:15.800
Horses do all the reach.

51:15.800 --> 51:18.600
I just take a little whip and hit their butts.

51:18.600 --> 51:22.680
Can we hit a tree to taste the harness or to test it?

51:22.680 --> 51:23.360
And taste it.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.040
I'd like to taste the harness.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.200
My brother needs to taste the harness.

51:27.200 --> 51:31.640
Soon you find yourselves outside of the Rat King's tomb.

51:31.640 --> 51:32.440
Oh, shit.

51:32.440 --> 51:35.400
You're standing in front of a massive slab of obsidian

51:35.400 --> 51:36.800
in the forest outside of town.

51:36.800 --> 51:39.720
This black monolith seems to absorb all light,

51:39.720 --> 51:42.200
and a gray stone door sits in the center

51:42.200 --> 51:44.920
with golden script scrawled all over it.

51:44.920 --> 51:46.400
There's also a doorknob.

51:46.400 --> 51:50.400
I don't think we should have left that bar.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.680
You drove.

51:51.680 --> 51:53.760
I'm refusing the call in front of the thing.

51:53.760 --> 51:55.360
You can't do that the whole adventure.

51:55.360 --> 51:58.200
It's just like an E-Lag Roth movie.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.480
It's just people going, don't do it.

51:59.480 --> 52:00.480
Don't do it.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.160
My eyeball.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.720
Anyways, guys, what do you think?

52:03.720 --> 52:07.000
You're the ones who are here.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.040
I go examine the golden script to see if it's a language I know.

52:10.040 --> 52:11.240
It's in Dwarven.

52:11.240 --> 52:12.360
I speak Dwarven.

52:12.360 --> 52:13.280
I read the thing.

52:13.280 --> 52:13.760
Oh.

52:13.760 --> 52:16.000
It says, touch the door with your left hand

52:16.000 --> 52:19.360
and then just turn the knob and push.

52:19.360 --> 52:22.280
I know a trap when I see one, fellas.

52:22.280 --> 52:23.560
Do I have trap sense?

52:23.560 --> 52:24.040
Yeah.

52:24.040 --> 52:25.120
We don't know what you're talking about,

52:25.120 --> 52:26.800
because all that happened to you internally.

52:26.800 --> 52:27.520
I'm a stickler.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.400
That's entertainment.

52:28.400 --> 52:31.040
I have perception.

52:31.040 --> 52:33.280
Can I check to see if this is a trap?

52:33.280 --> 52:33.760
Oh, yeah.

52:33.760 --> 52:34.880
Let me see here.

52:34.880 --> 52:35.800
Yeah.

52:35.800 --> 52:37.120
Am I going to get a dice roll?

52:37.120 --> 52:37.480
Oh, yeah.

52:37.480 --> 52:37.920
You just got it.

52:37.920 --> 52:38.760
Oh, yes.

52:38.760 --> 52:39.640
Feels good, doesn't it?

52:39.640 --> 52:40.320
Yeah, dice.

52:40.320 --> 52:41.000
I'm so excited.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.040
Examining the door, it seems to be highly magical,

52:44.040 --> 52:46.000
but not trapped.

52:46.000 --> 52:46.600
That's good.

52:46.600 --> 52:47.840
All right.

52:47.840 --> 52:50.880
Somebody go put their left hand on it and turn it.

52:50.880 --> 52:52.760
I shall put my left hand.

52:52.760 --> 52:57.240
I will not use my stunning fist, but I can, if I want to,

52:57.240 --> 52:58.240
just letting everyone know.

52:58.240 --> 52:59.400
You have a stunning fist?

52:59.400 --> 53:00.040
Yeah.

53:00.040 --> 53:01.400
Can you talk to us about them a lot?

53:01.400 --> 53:02.560
Can I see it?

53:02.560 --> 53:03.160
Yes.

53:03.160 --> 53:07.680
It will be featured in Room 611 later.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.840
Wow.

53:09.840 --> 53:13.160
I'll bring the magical lube.

53:13.160 --> 53:13.960
It is stunning.

53:13.960 --> 53:19.040
Oh, permission to open door with my left arm.

53:19.040 --> 53:23.200
Doing those things, you open the door easily.

53:23.200 --> 53:28.320
It swings open, revealing a staircase headed downwards.

53:28.320 --> 53:31.480
Are you there, town boys?

53:31.480 --> 53:35.800
What be your interest in this rat crown?

53:35.800 --> 53:38.360
We've heard many legends have never seen your like

53:38.360 --> 53:39.960
in the tavern.

53:39.960 --> 53:42.760
Fancy talk.

53:42.760 --> 53:43.880
Game of Thrones talking.

53:43.880 --> 53:45.840
Yes.

53:45.840 --> 53:49.600
On my face, do you notice the rat?

53:49.600 --> 53:51.280
Yeah.

53:51.280 --> 53:54.480
I told that rat one day that I would find his crown.

53:54.480 --> 53:55.600
Nice.

53:55.600 --> 53:58.400
But in the meantime, I would tattoo him to my face.

53:58.400 --> 54:00.600
Oh, those are rat tattoos on your face.

54:00.600 --> 54:01.560
Yes, that is correct.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.840
I was there, and so I was in the background

54:03.840 --> 54:04.800
tattooing myself, too.

54:04.800 --> 54:06.000
Yeah, he's my bestie.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.040
And you met a rat that died, and you

54:09.040 --> 54:12.640
quest to get his crown back, right?

54:12.640 --> 54:13.600
Yes.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.720
It doesn't exactly send a signal to the rats,

54:15.720 --> 54:17.680
don't fuck with these people.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.160
You kind of ended up worshiping them.

54:19.160 --> 54:19.920
Yes.

54:19.920 --> 54:22.560
Yes, I'm a big rat worshiper.

54:22.560 --> 54:26.360
You fed the trolls, as they say on Twitter.

54:26.360 --> 54:27.120
Indeed, I did.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.840
You should take time every once in a while

54:28.840 --> 54:34.480
to tell non-rats, thank you, I liked my show, too.

54:34.480 --> 54:38.240
Do a ratio of three to 10 that way when they say.

54:38.240 --> 54:41.720
I know you only respond to haters, so I guess you won't see this.

54:41.720 --> 54:44.240
Then you can tell that person, fuck you, you piece of shit.

54:44.240 --> 54:44.740
Yeah.

54:44.740 --> 54:46.760
I respond positively all the time, you little fuck.

54:46.760 --> 54:49.800
A fault holds what we know not what you speak of at all.

54:49.800 --> 54:50.720
No, not at all.

54:50.720 --> 54:54.000
I saw angels in a different world where stakes were lower,

54:54.000 --> 54:55.640
but anxiety was higher.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.960
Yes.

54:57.960 --> 55:00.600
So we're inside the tomb right now, Spencer?

55:00.600 --> 55:01.600
Oh, yeah.

55:01.600 --> 55:03.160
This is the staircase, though.

55:03.160 --> 55:05.040
Oh.

55:05.040 --> 55:07.720
I elect you to proceed first.

55:07.720 --> 55:09.880
OK, I'm little and agile, and I have dark.

55:09.880 --> 55:10.560
Is it lit?

55:10.560 --> 55:11.060
Dark?

55:11.060 --> 55:13.560
Out of the corner of your eyes.

55:13.560 --> 55:17.880
Fondue, you can see as bone weevil heads down the stairs,

55:17.880 --> 55:20.040
the brothers, they seem to be drawing their weapons

55:20.040 --> 55:21.120
as if in ambush.

55:21.120 --> 55:22.440
Stop, bone weevil.

55:22.440 --> 55:24.720
Don't, these guys, whoa.

55:24.720 --> 55:26.680
You believe the rat story, I see.

55:26.680 --> 55:28.560
No.

55:28.560 --> 55:29.160
Yes.

55:29.160 --> 55:32.240
I go back up the stairs.

55:32.240 --> 55:34.400
You damn it.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.760
I only went down a few, I'm little.

55:35.760 --> 55:36.920
I only went down like three stairs.

55:36.920 --> 55:37.880
I'm back up.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.600
Eye of acrobatics, can I chase him down?

55:40.600 --> 55:41.720
I think you went up, though.

55:41.720 --> 55:42.220
OK.

55:42.220 --> 55:43.240
I went up.

55:43.240 --> 55:46.240
OK, I go back down to meet everybody.

55:46.240 --> 55:47.360
I guess I misheard.

55:47.360 --> 55:49.520
No, no, actually, I go down one step

55:49.520 --> 55:53.000
so I keep a high advantage to level the playing field,

55:53.000 --> 55:54.840
and I draw my rapier.

55:54.840 --> 55:57.160
I'm sorry, what was that?

55:57.160 --> 55:57.840
My sword.

55:57.840 --> 55:59.440
Oh.

55:59.440 --> 56:02.240
It's spelled rapier, but it's just a sword.

56:02.240 --> 56:04.840
It's not that kind of crowd that's been established.

56:04.840 --> 56:07.360
I apologize.

56:07.360 --> 56:11.760
I shall put my stunning fists away.

56:11.760 --> 56:13.280
I think they like stunning fists.

56:13.280 --> 56:14.200
No, they like that.

56:14.200 --> 56:14.700
Oh.

56:14.700 --> 56:15.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:15.520 --> 56:16.360
You're Kevin James.

56:16.360 --> 56:17.400
You're at home jerking off.

56:17.400 --> 56:17.960
That's fine.

56:17.960 --> 56:20.280
Totally.

56:20.280 --> 56:22.400
You guys are in some sort of standoff situation.

56:22.400 --> 56:24.880
Ah!

56:24.880 --> 56:27.440
Well, drop your weapons.

56:27.440 --> 56:29.200
I draw my bastard sword.

56:29.200 --> 56:30.360
All right.

56:30.360 --> 56:31.360
Now everyone is drawn.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.640
Not everybody has to die here today.

56:33.640 --> 56:36.120
In fact, nobody has to.

56:36.120 --> 56:38.440
I offer a tree token.

56:42.240 --> 56:45.000
It's a strange ambush tactic.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.760
Yes.

56:46.760 --> 56:50.600
I say to fun, dude, don't fall for the tree token thing.

56:50.600 --> 56:52.520
I'm falling for it and being intrigued by it

56:52.520 --> 56:53.880
are two different things.

56:53.880 --> 56:54.840
I too am intrigued.

56:54.840 --> 56:56.880
You're going to take my tree token?

56:56.880 --> 56:58.040
Tell me more.

56:58.040 --> 57:01.000
Well, you take my tree token, and now

57:01.000 --> 57:03.960
that you've gotten us in here, you just walk away

57:03.960 --> 57:06.840
and let us have this rat treasure for ourselves.

57:06.840 --> 57:08.760
I continue up the staircase while they're

57:08.760 --> 57:10.000
having this conversation.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.200
Oh, that's the confu- it's a downward staircase.

57:12.200 --> 57:14.160
OK, then I- that's what I thought first too.

57:14.160 --> 57:16.120
I'm going back down the staircase now.

57:16.120 --> 57:18.520
I think I want to get to this crown before they do,

57:18.520 --> 57:20.320
and then I'll have the leverage.

57:20.320 --> 57:26.000
Suppose I took your token and used it to once a month

57:26.000 --> 57:30.040
by the unlimited access.

57:30.040 --> 57:31.160
What?

57:31.160 --> 57:34.960
All previous adventures.

57:34.960 --> 57:37.320
What sorts of adventures speak- speak of?

57:37.320 --> 57:39.120
Yeah, everything but Mr. Show.

57:39.120 --> 57:40.640
Oh, yeah.

57:40.640 --> 57:42.000
I don't know what happened there.

57:42.000 --> 57:42.480
Yeah.

57:42.480 --> 57:43.280
Because it's HBO.

57:43.280 --> 57:44.160
Almost comprehensive.

57:44.160 --> 57:46.560
Yeah, and not community, because that's Sony.

57:46.560 --> 57:47.840
Yeah, yeah.

57:47.840 --> 57:50.240
Yeah, everything that NBC has ever owned.

57:50.240 --> 57:51.320
Right.

57:51.320 --> 58:01.360
NBC, Nathaniel Boulevard.

58:01.360 --> 58:03.320
While they do industry talk, I examine

58:03.320 --> 58:05.440
the bottom of the staircase.

58:05.440 --> 58:07.800
Oh, oh man.

58:07.800 --> 58:10.680
You just see a circular room.

58:10.680 --> 58:13.400
Its walls are peppered in fist-sized holes.

58:13.400 --> 58:17.880
You can hear the chittering of mice and rats.

58:17.880 --> 58:23.360
Or I have fists that stunt these holes, which

58:23.360 --> 58:28.440
are shaped fist-sized.

58:28.440 --> 58:32.440
You've been here and punched here?

58:32.440 --> 58:35.160
Is it like me in Wisconsin?

58:35.160 --> 58:36.160
I don't know what are you saying.

58:36.160 --> 58:38.120
For the sake of this, I run back up the stairs and go,

58:38.120 --> 58:39.720
guys, there's fist-sized holes down here.

58:39.720 --> 58:41.200
You have a stunning fist.

58:41.200 --> 58:41.720
Right.

58:41.720 --> 58:44.080
Oh, oh, oh, I thought you were, OK.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.640
I was Game of Thrones-ing it.

58:45.640 --> 58:47.480
Oh, terribly.

58:47.480 --> 58:50.520
I will punch every hole.

58:50.520 --> 58:53.080
And I will go on the other side of the holes

58:53.080 --> 58:55.400
if there's a door that leads me to that area.

58:55.400 --> 58:58.080
And I won't know who's punching through those holes,

58:58.080 --> 58:59.320
because it won't matter.

58:59.320 --> 59:02.920
And that will make it hotter.

59:02.920 --> 59:08.680
And glory me to us in this world of holes.

59:08.680 --> 59:10.360
I'm just trying anything I can.

59:10.360 --> 59:12.040
It all is wonderful.

59:12.040 --> 59:15.520
By the way, did I tell you about my vow of poverty?

59:15.520 --> 59:17.880
I'm going to turn to the dwarf over here.

59:17.880 --> 59:19.320
I'm a goblin, asshole.

59:19.320 --> 59:21.320
And say, while they're dealing with this crap,

59:21.320 --> 59:22.600
let's get this crown.

59:22.600 --> 59:23.760
We shall form an alliance.

59:23.760 --> 59:24.680
Well, but don't we have to?

59:24.680 --> 59:27.840
I think we probably have to put a fist in these, like, these

59:27.840 --> 59:28.320
fist-sized holes.

59:28.320 --> 59:28.360
Yeah, he did it.

59:28.360 --> 59:29.160
Yeah, yeah, that's all right.

59:29.160 --> 59:29.880
I'm not my dumb joke.

59:29.880 --> 59:30.760
He fisted the holes.

59:30.760 --> 59:31.600
I was Yankevicking.

59:31.600 --> 59:32.520
You punched the holes.

59:32.520 --> 59:33.240
Well, let's see.

59:33.240 --> 59:34.560
What happened, Spencer?

59:34.560 --> 59:35.920
You get binned by rats.

59:35.920 --> 59:37.920
Oh!

59:37.920 --> 59:40.800
I was here for you, rats!

59:40.800 --> 59:45.480
That's what happens when you draw swords on people on stairs.

59:45.480 --> 59:49.600
So he tries every hole and doesn't work?

59:49.600 --> 59:50.520
Just the answer in there?

59:50.520 --> 59:54.640
I mean, they appear to be mouse holes.

59:54.640 --> 59:55.680
Oh, they're mouse holes.

59:55.680 --> 59:56.080
Yeah.

59:56.080 --> 59:58.800
Oh, they're not for stunning fists, they're just for mice.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.880
Is there anything else in the room?

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.040
Yeah.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.160
What is it?

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.120
Oh, let me see here.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.680
You see, you see what looks like a stunningly beautiful woman.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.960
Oh!

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.840
You've already fisted those holes,

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.160
but I can now use my burning hands on the woman.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.880
Ah!

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.920
I blush.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.400
I'm the guy like, sorry about these guys.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.720
I just met him in a bar.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.720
It's like, all right, happy hour.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.000
He's using burning hands on the woman.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.200
You spread your hands and shoot fire all over the room.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:38.960
Wow.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.920
It swirls around and consumes many rats

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.920
that are lying around on the ground.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920
But not the woman, I hope.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.320
He realized that that woman was never there.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.760
It was just you just were so bad at looking around

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.280
that you thought you saw something.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.120
Again!

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.960
Always, like usual, yes.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.720
Now, watch this.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.360
I look around.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.920
All right, well, you see a very obvious door.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.200
Not a woman at all.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.120
A door that is here on demand.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.880
What?

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.600
That you can watch.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.040
I open any time you want.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.520
Am I trying too hard to integrate?

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.160
Does the door open instantly so that you can be entertained

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:26.840
by this door?

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840
Please, it's curated.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.200
There's the door.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.880
You can do whatever you want, but by default,

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:36.360
the door is already flapping open and shut and you approach it.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.720
Is this door constructed of materials

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.480
across the pond as well?

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.960
Yeah, mostly, because that's the cheapest.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.840
It's a not-read dwarf.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.280
I go up to the door, Spencer.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.120
I go up to the door.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:50.920
It's a door.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920
I open the door.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.280
All right.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.960
And I turn back before I open the door.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.600
I turn back.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.520
Hey, remember the time you guys all thought you saw a lady

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.440
and you tried to burn her first off?

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.560
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.640
Remember before that, when you started to murder us?

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.840
Didn't they draw that?

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:07.200
Yes, but we made friends.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.360
It's kind of a delicate detente going on right now.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.640
What do we see inside this new place?

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.840
Oh, man, you see a hexagonal room.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.360
Metal coins litter the floor as do rats, who don't seem

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.080
bothered by your presence.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:20.960
Oh, they're nice rats.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.360
The walls have crude carvings of rats,

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.960
as well as crude carvings of a crown man wielding a club,

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.360
as well as crude carvings of a man sitting

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.800
on a throne of rats.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.840
In the far wall, you see a rotting wooden throne

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:39.440
and in it, a skeletal skeleton wearing a golden crown.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.240
Thanks, Obama.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:42.920
I don't know.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.800
It's just trying.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.040
Just trying.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.680
We have like one and a half minutes left.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.160
That's why.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.040
Why do you think I was there?

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.400
Bring the girl back.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.560
No, she's gone.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.880
Those three different ruined thingies

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.320
are in the way of the guy in the throne?

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:56.880
I'm sorry.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.760
What?

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.720
There was a thing with a guy sitting

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.200
there's carvings on the walls.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:02.800
Carvings on the walls.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.720
There's a skeleton with a crown on it.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720
You sit on the throne.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.880
There's a pictograph.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.880
It's instructions.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.480
There's a guy and there's rats.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.640
And then the guy sits in the, is there a throne?

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.720
Yeah, the throne is real.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.120
And the guy has a staff, right?

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:20.680
No.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.240
What?

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.960
No, shut up.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.640
No, shut up.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.720
I didn't mean that.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.000
I sit on the throne.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.240
There's a skeleton sitting in the throne.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.800
No, I, I, I, I, I.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.240
And it's wearing a gold crown.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:32.800
All right.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.320
Oh.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.040
Take the crown.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:34.680
I just could, yeah.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.400
Take the crown.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.120
Take the crown.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:36.840
No, hold it.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.280
That crown.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.720
Everything else is yours.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:48.000
The crown is one-eyed willies.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.160
You're going to give us all the rats?

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.600
And you, are you doing goonies?

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.960
Yeah, I wanted to create a dividing line

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.200
in the audience between everyone over 40

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.840
and everyone under 20.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.720
Thank you, 16.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.160
Sadly, we're ending that on a goonies reference.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.720
We're going to find out what happens.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.200
He's a six-out bandit.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.120
You won't know.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.600
Spencer Crittenden.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.760
Come on, Spencer, everybody.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.520
Thank you again, ever to Pyro.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.120
Everybody, it's Seedz over having a chance

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.040
to take you to New York TV Festival.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.840
Thank you, School of Visual Arts.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:22.880
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.840
You may, or Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.640
You're welcome.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.120
Spencer Crittenden, you may, master.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.440
I think we thanked everybody, right?

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.120
Seedz, oh, and Jeff, thanks, everybody.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.680
He thanked Natalie, and John, and Rupert,

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.600
all of whom have cancer.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.520
See, they don't know it.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.280
But I talked to their doctor tonight.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.280
No more rapping.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.280
Oh, it's for you for now.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.280
No more rapping.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.280
You're going to see it.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.280
And then how?

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.280
Money, pie, pie.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.280
Everybody, get the hell out of here.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.280
Oh, shit, Amy Poehler.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.280
Hell, all the comedy, all the time.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.280
Seesaw's going to fuck it with a slice of lamb.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.280
Did you get any of that?

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.280
It's a good show.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.280
It's a good show.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.280
It's a good show.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.280
It's a good show.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.280
It's a good show.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.280
It's a good show.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.280
It's a good show.
