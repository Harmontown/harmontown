{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:06.640\nWhen we set out to make this, we really, we came up with a filter that is, we like to\n\n00:06.640 --> 00:09.480\ncall right brain comedy.\n\n00:09.480 --> 00:13.600\nThe combination of funny and audacious and authentic.\n\n00:13.600 --> 00:17.040\nAnd then we came up with a list of people that we really wanted to work with.\n\n00:17.040 --> 00:22.300\nAnd at the very tippy top of that list was Dan Harmon.\n\n00:22.300 --> 00:25.840\nEverything that he's done with regard, they're loading on the stage.\n\n00:25.840 --> 00:30.320\nI'm literally vamping so that they can load Dan's mock-down stage.\n\n00:30.320 --> 00:34.440\nSo we really wanted to work with him.\n\n00:34.440 --> 00:39.600\nAnd he pitched a show which is the marriage of Dinner for Five, Rick and Morty in Game\n\n00:39.600 --> 00:41.600\nof Thrones.\n\n00:41.600 --> 00:45.960\nAnd it's a brilliant idea, it's really strange, but I'm not going to talk about it.\n\n00:45.960 --> 00:50.920\nI'm going to actually bring up the creator himself, a TV, literally a TV legend.\n\n00:50.920 --> 00:53.400\nI'm really happy he's here, I'm grateful he's here.\n\n00:53.400 --> 01:09.880\nMr. Dan Harmon, no, don't step on that.\n\n01:09.880 --> 01:14.320\nThe first thing they told me is don't walk on that.\n\n01:14.320 --> 01:15.320\nJust to trap you.\n\n01:15.320 --> 01:16.320\nWhat in the fuck?\n\n01:16.320 --> 01:17.320\nWhat?\n\n01:17.320 --> 01:18.320\nWhat?\n\n01:18.320 --> 01:21.200\nThey literally, I should have probably told you that beforehand.\n\n01:21.200 --> 01:27.240\nThat's not, there's signs everywhere for everything, that's the one place there should\n\n01:27.240 --> 01:28.240\nbe one.\n\n01:28.240 --> 01:31.400\nWe had a long conversation, they said whatever you do, don't let Dan walk on that.\n\n01:31.400 --> 01:32.960\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait, who went there?\n\n01:32.960 --> 01:34.960\nI have failed horribly at everything.\n\n01:34.960 --> 01:37.080\nEveryone knew but me.\n\n01:37.080 --> 01:38.080\nHow are you?\n\n01:38.080 --> 01:42.960\nAnother thing that, well, here's the thing that everyone knows about you, you can get\n\n01:42.960 --> 01:46.840\nWerner Herzog, the real one, for like a thousand bucks.\n\n01:46.840 --> 01:48.720\nI've done it.\n\n01:48.720 --> 01:50.720\nWe decided to go with a fake Werner Herzog.\n\n01:50.720 --> 01:58.360\nThat's not on record, that's just some guy doing a, he's a thousand bucks.\n\n01:58.360 --> 01:59.360\nWerner?\n\n01:59.360 --> 02:00.360\nThe real one.\n\n02:00.360 --> 02:01.360\nWe should have just called him then.\n\n02:01.360 --> 02:04.040\nHe doesn't, he always wants the money, his documentaries are not.\n\n02:04.040 --> 02:05.240\nDon't make money, everyone knows.\n\n02:05.240 --> 02:09.000\nI used to make documentaries, that's why I'm making comedy now.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:12.560\nThank you so much, it's great to be here.\n\n02:12.560 --> 02:13.560\nThank you.\n\n02:13.560 --> 02:18.520\nSo, can you talk a little bit about what Harmon Quest will be?\n\n02:18.520 --> 02:23.640\nIt's something that I've been conceiving ever since the day that we were doing Harmon\n\n02:23.640 --> 02:28.160\nTown, my podcast, which was never a career choice, in fact, it's been detrimental to\n\n02:28.160 --> 02:32.640\nmy career in every way, because it's the show at which I played the Chevy Chase voicemail\n\n02:32.640 --> 02:37.880\nand got fired, but I subsequently made it into a podcast because I was like, well, if\n\n02:37.880 --> 02:42.680\nthis is not going to be intimate, then let's just broadcast it and at that show, at one\n\n02:42.680 --> 02:48.920\npoint I thought, I've been fascinated with a certain fantasy role-playing game that\n\n02:48.920 --> 02:56.120\nhas no name, let alone any initials or anything that anyone would recognize.\n\n02:56.120 --> 02:59.720\nMy entire life, I've written a lot of sketches about it, it's like, it's my introduction\n\n02:59.720 --> 03:07.720\nto everything before improv, before anything, it was like the ultimate, like, gait into\n\n03:07.720 --> 03:08.720\nstorytelling.\n\n03:08.720 --> 03:15.520\nYeah, and just safety for nerds and this whole culture that we've entered.\n\n03:15.520 --> 03:22.520\nAnd so, in the podcast I said at one point, at the time I thought the joke will be how\n\n03:22.520 --> 03:26.600\nnot entertaining it is to play this game.\n\n03:26.600 --> 03:31.640\nAnd so, I actually thought in my head, I bet in my audience, if I ask for seven Dungeon\n\n03:31.640 --> 03:34.960\nMasters, seven will raise their hand.\n\n03:34.960 --> 03:39.160\nAnd nobody raised their hand, except for one guy who came up on stage, and his name was\n\n03:39.160 --> 03:45.920\nSpencer who we'll meet later, and he'll later say he was living in the Seamy Valley area\n\n03:45.920 --> 03:50.880\nand he came that night through some weird, pot-induced hallucination that he was like,\n\n03:50.880 --> 03:55.880\nI bet I should go ask, I think I should play D&D with Dan Harmon.\n\n03:55.880 --> 04:02.040\nIt's all very trippy and weird, but he became a fixture and we've been playing the game\n\n04:02.040 --> 04:03.040\never since.\n\n04:03.040 --> 04:09.360\nSince then, my fascination with the funniest thing I've ever seen on TV, which was the\n\n04:09.360 --> 04:16.600\nRicky Gervais HBO show, because I love the relationship between the real audio of Carl\n\n04:16.600 --> 04:22.320\nPilkington trying to explain himself and this team of animators that are like so gifted\n\n04:22.320 --> 04:30.120\nthat they're like, oh, no, this guy is struggling and being mocked, but I went to art school,\n\n04:30.120 --> 04:37.240\nI can show you what he means when he's talking about his theory about birds or worms or something.\n\n04:37.240 --> 04:39.880\nThey actually make his point better than he ever does.\n\n04:39.880 --> 04:44.320\nYes, absolutely, and everyone's point is made when they're supported by-\n\n04:44.320 --> 04:45.320\nBeautiful animation.\n\n04:45.320 --> 04:50.640\nYes, or any medium, yeah, it's truly like anyone can be a hero and all that stuff.\n\n04:50.640 --> 04:55.240\nAnd in fantasy role-playing, that's what you're drawn to, is the idea that you can\n\n04:55.240 --> 05:00.040\nbe a hero, and yet the irony often is that you can take 10 minutes to open a door.\n\n05:00.040 --> 05:01.040\nBecause you argue-\n\n05:01.040 --> 05:03.240\nI'm going to try my sword, I'm going to try this.\n\n05:03.240 --> 05:09.960\nAnd I think it's funny, and so the idea from the get-go was, or from the seesaw, you should\n\n05:09.960 --> 05:10.960\nhave called it get-go.\n\n05:10.960 --> 05:18.120\nIt'll remind people of auto insurance, they'll love it.\n\n05:18.120 --> 05:25.040\nBy the way, Shapiro, what are you, are you an Avenger or just a self-loathing Jew?\n\n05:25.040 --> 05:26.040\nWhat?\n\n05:26.040 --> 05:27.040\nShapiro.\n\n05:27.040 --> 05:30.120\nI've had many times I've been called a self-loathing Jew.\n\n05:30.120 --> 05:31.120\nWait, why?\n\n05:31.120 --> 05:32.120\nSeriously?\n\n05:32.120 --> 05:33.120\nYeah.\n\n05:33.120 --> 05:36.920\nIt's a Philadelphia thing, if you're from the Delaware Valley or down there, everyone\n\n05:36.920 --> 05:43.800\nthinks you're like a high-flute, Levine, Levine, Einstein, it's really actually typical\n\n05:43.800 --> 05:45.760\nSouth Jersey white trash bullshit.\n\n05:45.760 --> 05:48.040\nOkay, now I get it.\n\n05:48.040 --> 05:49.320\n609, anyone?\n\n05:49.320 --> 05:53.360\nNot 69, 609, it's an area code inside.\n\n05:53.360 --> 06:02.280\nMy grandparents on my mom's side, last name, now pronounced Riek, used to be Reich.\n\n06:02.280 --> 06:04.360\nWow, you can see why they changed that.\n\n06:04.360 --> 06:06.560\nUh-huh, yes I can, Mr. Shapiro.\n\n06:06.560 --> 06:12.520\nYes, well played, let's all live in a masquerade.\n\n06:12.520 --> 06:16.080\nI'm supporting my father's family.\n\n06:16.080 --> 06:17.640\nAs we all are.\n\n06:17.640 --> 06:23.200\nAnyways, where was I, yeah, we're launching a show, it's called Seasaw, it's $4 a month,\n\n06:23.200 --> 06:29.720\noh shit, don't walk on the thing, it's a trap, there's nothing but dead Bengal tigers down\n\n06:29.720 --> 06:30.720\nthere.\n\n06:30.720 --> 06:31.720\nWhere'd it go?\n\n06:31.720 --> 06:32.720\nName Seasaw.\n\n06:32.720 --> 06:33.720\nSeasaw.\n\n06:33.720 --> 06:44.280\nOkay, so it's, so that's it, I don't know, I pitched it to Amy Carlson at UCP, Universal\n\n06:44.280 --> 06:48.360\nCable Productions, our production partner on this, and then we met on a teleconference.\n\n06:48.360 --> 06:50.480\nYeah, because you came in subsequently.\n\n06:50.480 --> 06:51.480\nI had to sell you.\n\n06:51.480 --> 06:52.480\nI had to sell you.\n\n06:52.480 --> 06:53.480\nAll right.\n\n06:53.480 --> 06:58.200\nOn doing it with us, and one of the things that was on the interwebs this weekend is why\n\n06:58.200 --> 07:02.880\nyou decided, why this place of all places to do it, and I don't know the answer to that\n\n07:02.880 --> 07:07.200\nquestion, so I answer, I ask it very risk-takingly.\n\n07:07.200 --> 07:12.800\nBecause the budget was higher, because no one would ever, it wouldn't be on regular\n\n07:12.800 --> 07:16.880\nTV, it could have been a web thing, but it would have to be all animation.\n\n07:16.880 --> 07:22.360\nYou said dinner for five, which you had a hand in creating, right?\n\n07:22.360 --> 07:26.160\nSo the show will be, the animation isn't done, but we've shot the stuff.\n\n07:26.160 --> 07:31.000\nSo what it is is like sort of dinner for five quality, Nathan Fillian sitting at a table\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:37.600\nwith Spencer and myself, and Jeff Davis, and my now ex-wife, Erin McGathy, God damn it,\n\n07:37.600 --> 07:38.600\ndistracting, distracting.\n\n07:38.600 --> 07:39.600\nYou did that.\n\n07:39.600 --> 07:43.040\nNo, it was the show, the show broke us up.\n\n07:43.040 --> 07:48.160\nYou will hear from my lawyer, David Fleshmain.\n\n07:48.160 --> 07:53.440\nI thought, isn't it like, do we cheat him and how?\n\n07:53.440 --> 07:55.960\nDo we cheat him and who?\n\n07:55.960 --> 07:57.200\nIt's all about the vowels.\n\n07:57.200 --> 08:01.360\nSo it's Nathan and a bunch of other really cool people coming in.\n\n08:01.360 --> 08:03.720\nCelebrity guests, most of whom have shows on CISO.\n\n08:03.720 --> 08:07.040\nAnd then you roll the die, and you go into the fantasy role-playing, and then it animates.\n\n08:07.040 --> 08:08.040\nIt's animation.\n\n08:08.040 --> 08:09.040\nIt's like 80% animation.\n\n08:09.040 --> 08:11.280\nYou promised me this beautiful animation.\n\n08:11.280 --> 08:12.280\nIt's gonna be beautiful.\n\n08:12.280 --> 08:14.400\nBecause I'm paying enough.\n\n08:14.400 --> 08:20.760\nSo with that, thank you again for, it's nice, you should do a spit take.\n\n08:20.760 --> 08:23.320\nIt's not beautiful.\n\n08:23.320 --> 08:24.440\nThank you for coming.\n\n08:24.440 --> 08:26.040\nThank you for bringing your crew.\n\n08:26.040 --> 08:31.760\nAnd with that, I will cede the stage to you and your, oh, do you mean leave it?\n\n08:31.760 --> 08:37.680\nOr side the stage to you and your Harmon Quest, Harmontown crew.\n\n08:37.680 --> 08:38.680\nAll right.\n\n08:38.680 --> 08:39.680\nGreat.\n\n08:39.680 --> 08:40.680\nSteve Jobs is dead.\n\n08:40.680 --> 08:41.680\nLong live Evan Shapiro.\n\n08:41.680 --> 08:42.680\nThat dammit.\n\n08:42.680 --> 08:43.680\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the SVA Theater.\n\n08:43.680 --> 08:44.680\nAm I correct about that?\n\n08:44.680 --> 08:45.680\nWhich did?\n\n08:45.680 --> 08:46.680\nNo?\n\n08:46.680 --> 08:47.680\nWhat's it called?\n\n08:47.680 --> 08:48.680\nSVA.\n\n08:48.680 --> 08:49.680\nWhat's this stand for?\n\n08:49.680 --> 08:50.680\nIt's still a visual arts theater here somewhere in New York City.\n\n08:50.680 --> 08:51.680\nA very rare, special Harmontown is now in session.\n\n08:51.680 --> 08:52.680\nPlease welcome Emerging Chetlee from his show, Harmontown.\n\n08:52.680 --> 08:53.680\nWelcome to the SVA Theater.\n\n08:53.680 --> 09:22.680\nThe mayor of Harmontown, the star of Harmon Quest, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n09:22.680 --> 09:29.680\nThe TV is the same as it used to be.\n\n09:29.680 --> 09:31.680\nThere's going to be some changes.\n\n09:31.680 --> 09:32.680\nOkay.\n\n09:32.680 --> 09:33.680\nAll right.\n\n09:33.680 --> 09:34.680\nThat's fine.\n\n09:34.680 --> 09:35.680\nWe can get the lights back up now.\n\n09:35.680 --> 09:36.680\nEveryone's a critic.\n\n09:36.680 --> 09:37.680\nAll right.\n\n09:37.680 --> 09:38.680\nLiterally, tonight, everyone's a critic.\n\n09:38.680 --> 09:39.680\nOh, loud enough.\n\n09:39.680 --> 09:40.680\nI don't feel loud.\n\n09:40.680 --> 09:41.680\nYeah.\n\n09:41.680 --> 09:42.680\nI mean...\n\n09:42.680 --> 09:43.680\nYou don't feel loud either.\n\n09:43.680 --> 09:44.680\nNo.\n\n09:44.680 --> 09:45.680\nAnd what the truth is, normally...\n\n09:45.680 --> 09:46.680\nWe're used to being in a small, intimate space, doing this.\n\n09:46.680 --> 09:47.680\nWe're used to more monitor, too.\n\n09:47.680 --> 09:51.680\nBut I will say, when we were watching all the very funny content, the level's very low.\n\n09:51.680 --> 09:54.680\nIt's like you should blast the people with the funny stuff.\n\n09:54.680 --> 09:55.680\nAre they...\n\n09:55.680 --> 09:56.680\nOkay.\n\n09:56.680 --> 09:57.680\nSomeone's sarcastically turning it up now.\n\n09:57.680 --> 09:58.680\nThere it is.\n\n09:58.680 --> 09:59.680\nThere it is.\n\n09:59.680 --> 10:00.680\nOkay.\n\n10:00.680 --> 10:01.680\nOh.\n\n10:01.680 --> 10:02.680\nYeah.\n\n10:02.680 --> 10:03.680\nOkay.\n\n10:03.680 --> 10:04.680\nWe got it.\n\n10:04.680 --> 10:05.680\nThat's where it should have been.\n\n10:05.680 --> 10:06.680\nThat cartoon was amazing.\n\n10:06.680 --> 10:07.680\nThe Sinai thing.\n\n10:07.680 --> 10:08.680\nVery funny.\n\n10:08.680 --> 10:09.680\nThat's intimidatingly funny.\n\n10:09.680 --> 10:10.680\nHas anyone pulled off a cartoon sketch show?\n\n10:10.680 --> 10:11.680\nRobot Chicken.\n\n10:11.680 --> 10:12.680\nAll right.\n\n10:12.680 --> 10:13.680\nDifferent venue.\n\n10:13.680 --> 10:14.680\nThat's why I do that.\n\n10:14.680 --> 10:15.680\nA competitor.\n\n10:15.680 --> 10:16.680\nAll right.\n\n10:16.680 --> 10:23.680\nWe don't have anything to talk about, so let's keep it moving.\n\n10:23.680 --> 10:24.680\nWe have one thing to talk about.\n\n10:24.680 --> 10:32.680\nWhen you walked across this inch and a half piece of plywood, it bowed like a fiddle.\n\n10:32.680 --> 10:34.680\nWhy would that be there?\n\n10:34.680 --> 10:35.680\nI don't know.\n\n10:35.680 --> 10:36.680\nThat's insane.\n\n10:36.680 --> 10:37.680\nI don't want to talk about it.\n\n10:37.680 --> 10:42.680\nI was almost certain that was the end of my career, because without you, I'm nobody.\n\n10:42.680 --> 10:46.680\nI would be honored to die that way, but angry.\n\n10:46.680 --> 10:51.680\nBut you said that beneath it is a pit full of dead bangle tigers.\n\n10:51.680 --> 10:54.680\nYou'd land gently on a bunch of soft bangle tigers down there.\n\n10:54.680 --> 11:00.680\nWell, yeah, but even a dead bangle tiger, have you ever stepped on a dead bee?\n\n11:00.680 --> 11:02.680\nThat's the only bee I've ever been stung by.\n\n11:02.680 --> 11:04.680\nI stepped on a dead bee on a beach.\n\n11:04.680 --> 11:05.680\nWe'll talk about it later.\n\n11:05.680 --> 11:07.680\nHow did you know it was dead when you stepped on it?\n\n11:07.680 --> 11:08.680\nYou saw a dead bee?\n\n11:08.680 --> 11:12.680\nWell, because it didn't hurt as much as I had dreaded a bee sting would ever hurt.\n\n11:12.680 --> 11:15.680\nSo I was like, that must have been just a dead bee.\n\n11:15.680 --> 11:17.680\nAnd I went back and the bee was dead.\n\n11:17.680 --> 11:18.680\nAnd I was like, I'm sorry.\n\n11:18.680 --> 11:20.680\nAnd he was like, fuck you.\n\n11:20.680 --> 11:24.680\nAnd like, I already died and then you stepped on me and I gave you what I could.\n\n11:24.680 --> 11:26.680\nAnd I was like, it felt like a little piece of glass.\n\n11:26.680 --> 11:29.680\nAnd he's like noted and he died.\n\n11:29.680 --> 11:33.680\nI lived my life serving an insectoid hive mind.\n\n11:33.680 --> 11:38.680\nBy the way, the final joke is going to be on you, so did you.\n\n11:38.680 --> 11:42.680\nAnd I was like, whoa, bee, don't.\n\n11:42.680 --> 11:45.680\nLike, I'm a sentient primate.\n\n11:45.680 --> 11:46.680\nI'm going to live for 70 years.\n\n11:46.680 --> 11:50.680\nAnd he's like, just figure it out.\n\n11:50.680 --> 11:54.680\nThis is the first time we've done a Harmontown since I went away for two and a half weeks.\n\n11:54.680 --> 11:56.680\nAnd while I was away, divorce.\n\n11:56.680 --> 11:57.680\nYeah.\n\n11:57.680 --> 12:01.680\nBut the bee was a big deal.\n\n12:01.680 --> 12:02.680\nI'll never forget that.\n\n12:02.680 --> 12:05.680\nI think you're using the bee to deflect from your real emotions right now.\n\n12:05.680 --> 12:06.680\nNo, no, no.\n\n12:06.680 --> 12:07.680\nAll right, let me look at my notes.\n\n12:07.680 --> 12:08.680\nSee, now you're using your phone.\n\n12:08.680 --> 12:10.680\nIt's a very classic Carmen.\n\n12:10.680 --> 12:12.680\nWell, we only have so much time.\n\n12:12.680 --> 12:17.680\nWe have to give them a reader's digest version of our normally fast-paced show.\n\n12:17.680 --> 12:20.680\nLet's bring up Spencer Crittenden, the Game Master.\n\n12:20.680 --> 12:22.680\nHell yeah!\n\n12:22.680 --> 12:27.680\nJust so that he's here when we...\n\n12:27.680 --> 12:29.680\nOh, I want that music to be louder.\n\n12:29.680 --> 12:30.680\nThere we go.\n\n12:30.680 --> 12:37.680\nWe're getting there now.\n\n12:37.680 --> 12:39.680\nThis is a mismatch here.\n\n12:39.680 --> 12:45.680\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n12:45.680 --> 12:48.680\nI'm going to fall down.\n\n12:48.680 --> 12:49.680\nAll right.\n\n12:49.680 --> 12:51.680\nWell, at least we got the mic stand.\n\n12:51.680 --> 12:56.680\nThis is a school of visual arts.\n\n12:56.680 --> 12:58.680\nIt's the golden age of TV.\n\n12:58.680 --> 13:00.680\nHe's gone, but the content is...\n\n13:00.680 --> 13:01.680\nThere's so many visual arts.\n\n13:01.680 --> 13:02.680\nFor the front row, it's perfect perspective.\n\n13:02.680 --> 13:06.680\nYou look like you're sitting down on a table right there for the front row.\n\n13:06.680 --> 13:07.680\nOkay.\n\n13:07.680 --> 13:08.680\nIs this going to work?\n\n13:08.680 --> 13:09.680\nNo, it's not going to work.\n\n13:09.680 --> 13:11.680\nOkay, well, all right, let's start.\n\n13:11.680 --> 13:13.680\nWe have to speed through my shit.\n\n13:13.680 --> 13:14.680\nLet's do a segment called...\n\n13:14.680 --> 13:15.680\nDo you have music cues?\n\n13:15.680 --> 13:16.680\nKind of.\n\n13:16.680 --> 13:17.680\nI'm doing it off my phone.\n\n13:17.680 --> 13:18.680\nAll right.\n\n13:18.680 --> 13:19.680\nWhat do you want?\n\n13:19.680 --> 13:21.680\nLet's do a segment called Divorce Advice Corner.\n\n13:21.680 --> 13:22.680\nDivorce Advice Corner.\n\n13:22.680 --> 13:24.680\nHold up one second.\n\n13:24.680 --> 13:26.680\nDivorce Advice Corner.\n\n13:26.680 --> 13:28.680\nYo.\n\n13:28.680 --> 13:30.680\nDivorce Advice.\n\n13:30.680 --> 13:32.680\nWhen you need it, it must be nice\n\n13:32.680 --> 13:35.680\nto give it, to see it, to receive it, to give it.\n\n13:35.680 --> 13:36.680\nYo.\n\n13:36.680 --> 13:37.680\nYou got to live it.\n\n13:37.680 --> 13:39.680\nWrapping while making a drink.\n\n13:39.680 --> 13:40.680\nNo.\n\n13:40.680 --> 13:42.680\nI'm just professional.\n\n13:42.680 --> 13:43.680\nThe multitasking rapper.\n\n13:43.680 --> 13:44.680\nYo.\n\n13:44.680 --> 13:45.680\nYo.\n\n13:45.680 --> 13:46.680\nMultitasking.\n\n13:46.680 --> 13:47.680\nRapper.\n\n13:47.680 --> 13:50.680\nI got an app called Slack for my team collaborations.\n\n13:50.680 --> 13:52.680\nIt was a channel for each collaboration.\n\n13:52.680 --> 13:56.680\nApproximately all across the nation.\n\n13:56.680 --> 13:57.680\nWhat happened?\n\n13:57.680 --> 13:59.680\nAre we all going to die tonight?\n\n13:59.680 --> 14:01.680\nThis is where we all die.\n\n14:01.680 --> 14:06.680\nIt's a journey.\n\n14:06.680 --> 14:07.680\nThat was...\n\n14:07.680 --> 14:08.680\nYeah.\n\n14:08.680 --> 14:09.680\nYeah.\n\n14:09.680 --> 14:11.680\nYou're good, man.\n\n14:11.680 --> 14:13.680\nThis is a pretty good show so far.\n\n14:13.680 --> 14:15.680\nThis is a lot better than the last few.\n\n14:15.680 --> 14:16.680\nNo.\n\n14:16.680 --> 14:17.680\nYeah.\n\n14:17.680 --> 14:18.680\nIt's not as good as the animated show.\n\n14:18.680 --> 14:19.680\nIt's like a Swiss watch.\n\n14:19.680 --> 14:22.680\nBut they had time to finish that, and we're just...\n\n14:22.680 --> 14:23.680\nYeah.\n\n14:23.680 --> 14:24.680\nYeah.\n\n14:24.680 --> 14:25.680\nOkay.\n\n14:25.680 --> 14:27.680\nWell, you thought my...\n\n14:27.680 --> 14:28.680\nNo.\n\n14:28.680 --> 14:30.680\nMy divorce advice corner is about...\n\n14:30.680 --> 14:34.680\nPlease don't give me advice about my divorce.\n\n14:34.680 --> 14:35.680\nMost people...\n\n14:35.680 --> 14:36.680\nI was actually uplifted.\n\n14:36.680 --> 14:39.680\nMy wife and I, we got married.\n\n14:39.680 --> 14:43.680\nWe decided not to be married anymore.\n\n14:43.680 --> 14:46.680\nSo there's two categories of people where you go like,\n\n14:46.680 --> 14:48.680\nyou let people know, and it's weird.\n\n14:48.680 --> 14:49.680\nIt always feels shameful.\n\n14:49.680 --> 14:52.680\nYou feel like you spilled just jelly.\n\n14:52.680 --> 14:53.680\nOr something.\n\n14:53.680 --> 14:54.680\nAnything.\n\n14:54.680 --> 14:55.680\nWhy do I...\n\n14:55.680 --> 14:56.680\nAnything.\n\n14:56.680 --> 14:57.680\nNothing should be spilled.\n\n14:57.680 --> 15:02.680\nLet alone a lifetime together and 11 months after you threw a big party and said,\n\n15:02.680 --> 15:07.680\nI love God and her father, and I swear this one's for keeps.\n\n15:07.680 --> 15:12.680\nAnd then you're like, forget it.\n\n15:12.680 --> 15:13.680\nIt feels shameful.\n\n15:13.680 --> 15:14.680\nIt feels terrible.\n\n15:14.680 --> 15:19.680\nIt's like joining the Boy Scouts and getting one yellow bead and then just being like,\n\n15:19.680 --> 15:21.680\nyeah, but I like computers.\n\n15:21.680 --> 15:23.680\nDo Boy Scouts get beads?\n\n15:23.680 --> 15:24.680\nWhat?\n\n15:24.680 --> 15:25.680\nBeads?\n\n15:25.680 --> 15:26.680\nYeah, just don't get excited.\n\n15:26.680 --> 15:27.680\nThey're just regular beads.\n\n15:27.680 --> 15:28.680\nWhy?\n\n15:28.680 --> 15:29.680\nNo, you wear them.\n\n15:29.680 --> 15:31.680\nYou don't put them in your butt, Spencer.\n\n15:31.680 --> 15:34.680\nThis guy loves beads in his butt.\n\n15:34.680 --> 15:36.680\nAll right.\n\n15:36.680 --> 15:38.680\nI mean, sure, doesn't everybody...\n\n15:38.680 --> 15:40.680\nI mean, Boy Scouts do the...\n\n15:40.680 --> 15:41.680\nI don't think they get beads.\n\n15:41.680 --> 15:43.680\nWell, they did in the 80s.\n\n15:43.680 --> 15:44.680\nYeah, whatever.\n\n15:44.680 --> 15:48.680\nWell, you think now they get like solar panels?\n\n15:48.680 --> 15:51.680\nLike monster energy drinks or something.\n\n15:51.680 --> 15:53.680\nThey probably do get like a Pepsi.\n\n15:53.680 --> 15:56.680\nYeah, they probably get like a TV and a scholarship to...\n\n15:56.680 --> 15:58.680\nWhat am I talking about?\n\n15:58.680 --> 15:59.680\nAll right.\n\n15:59.680 --> 16:05.680\nSo I'm just saying, like, so most people you go, like you broach the subject tenderly\n\n16:05.680 --> 16:12.680\nand you go, yeah, I don't know when to tell you this, but yeah, it's...\n\n16:12.680 --> 16:14.680\nAnd most people are like...\n\n16:14.680 --> 16:18.680\nIt's kind of, you know, it's nice because you're already in a shameful place.\n\n16:18.680 --> 16:23.680\nAnd most people, they'll say, oh, I'm on my third, like, did you have kids?\n\n16:23.680 --> 16:24.680\nAnd you go, no.\n\n16:24.680 --> 16:26.680\nAnd they go, whew, dodged a bullet.\n\n16:26.680 --> 16:28.680\nOr they'll just go, like, yeah, it happens.\n\n16:28.680 --> 16:29.680\nIt happens.\n\n16:29.680 --> 16:34.680\nAnd then there's that like 1% of people that are like, well, did you try to make it work?\n\n16:34.680 --> 16:37.680\nAnd most of those people, they know you the least.\n\n16:37.680 --> 16:39.680\nAnd it's like just strangers.\n\n16:39.680 --> 16:40.680\nThey're like, don't...\n\n16:40.680 --> 16:42.680\nYou're talking about yourself, obviously.\n\n16:42.680 --> 16:46.680\nLike, did you try?\n\n16:46.680 --> 16:47.680\nNo, I didn't.\n\n16:47.680 --> 16:51.680\nI thought, you know, we just, we got married and then we thought, you know what would\n\n16:51.680 --> 17:00.680\nbe fun and pleasurable and inexpensive and easy and the path of least resistance.\n\n17:00.680 --> 17:03.680\nAnd let's just do it without thinking about it.\n\n17:03.680 --> 17:04.680\nLet's get divorced.\n\n17:04.680 --> 17:06.680\nLike, we didn't think about it.\n\n17:06.680 --> 17:07.680\nThank you so much.\n\n17:07.680 --> 17:08.680\nYou asshole.\n\n17:08.680 --> 17:10.680\nYou terrible, terrible person.\n\n17:10.680 --> 17:17.680\nWhy is it that when married people hear that you're getting a divorce, some of them, not\n\n17:17.680 --> 17:25.680\nall of you, but they all feel like they're allowed to tell you that you made the wrong\n\n17:25.680 --> 17:30.680\ndecision, but if divorced people tell married people the same thing, even though the divorce\n\n17:30.680 --> 17:33.680\nrate is like 80%, so there's way more of us.\n\n17:33.680 --> 17:38.680\nBut if you tell, if someone says, I decided to get married and you say, I don't know about\n\n17:38.680 --> 17:41.680\nthat, you're called a dick.\n\n17:41.680 --> 17:43.680\nSo what are the rules that are applying?\n\n17:43.680 --> 17:44.680\nAnd it's always the same thing.\n\n17:44.680 --> 17:46.680\nIt's like, oh, marriage is hard.\n\n17:46.680 --> 17:47.680\nMarriage takes work.\n\n17:47.680 --> 17:49.680\nSo it's combat rules.\n\n17:49.680 --> 17:53.680\nIt's like, if you're a veteran, you're allowed to talk about 9-11 more.\n\n17:53.680 --> 17:55.680\nLike, you're allowed to...\n\n17:55.680 --> 18:01.680\nLike, even if you're a reservist, even in any capacity, if you've ever worn a uniform,\n\n18:01.680 --> 18:03.680\nlike, you're more of a hero, which is true.\n\n18:03.680 --> 18:09.680\nLike, you've volunteered yourself for, like, hard-ass, like, life-risking work.\n\n18:09.680 --> 18:14.680\nAnd so anybody that ever says, like, who knows if I should vote this time, Duke.\n\n18:14.680 --> 18:19.680\nAnd then Duke from G.I. Joe is like, hey, knowing it's half the battle.\n\n18:19.680 --> 18:21.680\nAnd you're like, okay, fuck, oh, shit.\n\n18:21.680 --> 18:23.680\nI can't argue with you.\n\n18:23.680 --> 18:25.680\nJust won't invite you next Christmas.\n\n18:25.680 --> 18:33.680\nBut it's like, so if the rules apply, the same rules apply to combat as to marriage,\n\n18:33.680 --> 18:36.680\nwhy are you married?\n\n18:36.680 --> 18:43.680\nBecause it's not a fight, and you should just get divorced.\n\n18:43.680 --> 18:47.680\nJust like combat rules.\n\n18:47.680 --> 18:51.680\nWell, no, in combat, if you're like, this is hard and you leave,\n\n18:51.680 --> 18:54.680\nthat's called losing a war, which can have global repercussions.\n\n18:54.680 --> 18:59.680\nIn marriage, if you're like, this is hard, we should leave, that's a victory.\n\n18:59.680 --> 19:05.680\nThat's one of the two most beautiful things a couple can do in addition to giving married.\n\n19:05.680 --> 19:10.680\nBecause it takes just as much bravery and just as much respect for the other person\n\n19:10.680 --> 19:14.680\nand just as much, like, I cried just as much.\n\n19:14.680 --> 19:17.680\nLike, it's like, it's a beautiful thing, and most of us do it.\n\n19:17.680 --> 19:20.680\nWe get married and then we get divorced.\n\n19:20.680 --> 19:22.680\nWill you get married again, do you think?\n\n19:22.680 --> 19:25.680\nYeah, three more times.\n\n19:25.680 --> 19:31.680\nNo, my penis is a third nipple at this point, and I'm happy now.\n\n19:31.680 --> 19:32.680\nSome people like that.\n\n19:32.680 --> 19:38.680\nNo, well, yeah, I mean, Evan Shapiro maybe, but like...\n\n19:38.680 --> 19:42.680\nIt begs the question, what is sex and what is just an overall deal?\n\n19:42.680 --> 19:45.680\nI've been to...\n\n19:45.680 --> 19:48.680\nI'm into gals, but I want to make out what Evan Shapiro's hair.\n\n19:48.680 --> 19:50.680\nHis hair is really good.\n\n19:50.680 --> 19:52.680\nThat guy's hair?\n\n19:52.680 --> 19:55.680\nPeople are starting to mention it, it's becoming famous hair.\n\n19:55.680 --> 19:58.680\nI feel like it's by his design that it's becoming famous.\n\n19:58.680 --> 20:02.680\nI don't think there's a lot of work into it, but I think he's got something special going on.\n\n20:02.680 --> 20:04.680\nAlright, next segment.\n\n20:04.680 --> 20:11.680\nI'm saying he didn't have to go into creating TV special video demand platform thingies.\n\n20:11.680 --> 20:13.680\nHe could have just been the hair model.\n\n20:13.680 --> 20:15.680\nYeah, I know, he probably doesn't have to do anything.\n\n20:15.680 --> 20:19.680\nThat means he must be really good at doing TV if he's...\n\n20:19.680 --> 20:20.680\nWhat?\n\n20:20.680 --> 20:21.680\nGo ahead.\n\n20:21.680 --> 20:22.680\nOh, thank you.\n\n20:22.680 --> 20:25.680\nAlright, so, okay, well, I'm racist.\n\n20:25.680 --> 20:27.680\nI wanted to bring that up.\n\n20:27.680 --> 20:32.680\nYo, I'm racist.\n\n20:32.680 --> 20:36.680\nOkay.\n\n20:36.680 --> 20:37.680\nI really am.\n\n20:37.680 --> 20:38.680\nIt's official now because...\n\n20:38.680 --> 20:40.680\nI've never doubted that for a minute.\n\n20:40.680 --> 20:43.680\nWell, okay, I did, and now I'm like really...\n\n20:43.680 --> 20:46.680\nWell, yeah, like you said earlier today, you obsess about race,\n\n20:46.680 --> 20:48.680\nbut what's the difference at some point?\n\n20:48.680 --> 20:49.680\nRight.\n\n20:49.680 --> 20:52.680\nYou can cross a Rubicon of obsession about race.\n\n20:52.680 --> 20:57.680\nAnd I crossed it today because I was sitting at the hotel bar,\n\n20:57.680 --> 21:02.680\nand there's pictures on the wall of famous people that either stayed in the hotel or whatever,\n\n21:02.680 --> 21:04.680\nbut it's like black and white photos.\n\n21:04.680 --> 21:05.680\nAnd so it's like...\n\n21:05.680 --> 21:08.680\nIt all has this 60s vibe, and there's a guy laying in bed,\n\n21:08.680 --> 21:11.680\nand I was looking at the camera, and he's like,\n\n21:11.680 --> 21:13.680\nI just assumed it's just a wall of famous people,\n\n21:13.680 --> 21:15.680\nand I'm from LA, and so I'm just like,\n\n21:15.680 --> 21:19.680\nthat's just pictures of famous people from the 60s that stayed here.\n\n21:19.680 --> 21:22.680\nAnd I was like, am I racist, or is that Morgan Freeman?\n\n21:22.680 --> 21:26.680\nAnd you're like, no, that's Jimi Hendrix.\n\n21:26.680 --> 21:27.680\nAnd I'm racist.\n\n21:27.680 --> 21:30.680\nI like that you think that Morgan Freeman stayed at that hotel in the 60s.\n\n21:30.680 --> 21:31.680\nI love that.\n\n21:31.680 --> 21:32.680\nWell, I mean, my mind also that Morgan Freeman...\n\n21:32.680 --> 21:34.680\nHe was a full grown adult?\n\n21:34.680 --> 21:35.680\nI mean, he might have been.\n\n21:35.680 --> 21:36.680\nMaybe he probably was, yeah.\n\n21:36.680 --> 21:37.680\nI don't know.\n\n21:37.680 --> 21:40.680\nHow old is Morgan Freeman?\n\n21:40.680 --> 21:41.680\nOld enough.\n\n21:41.680 --> 21:42.680\nYeah.\n\n21:42.680 --> 21:44.680\nBut that hotel wouldn't have been a boutique hotel back then.\n\n21:44.680 --> 21:45.680\nIt would have been a flop.\n\n21:45.680 --> 21:46.680\nYeah.\n\n21:46.680 --> 21:49.680\nSpeaking of racism, that hotel is like...\n\n21:49.680 --> 21:51.680\nAlso, the picture of all those paintings,\n\n21:51.680 --> 21:53.680\nif I can draw it out for you,\n\n21:53.680 --> 21:54.680\nthere was what he thought was Morgan Freeman,\n\n21:54.680 --> 21:57.680\nsurrounded by David Bowie, Mick Jagger,\n\n21:57.680 --> 21:59.680\nRick Sinatra, Chet Baker,\n\n21:59.680 --> 22:02.680\nand a young Morgan Freeman laying in the bed.\n\n22:02.680 --> 22:07.680\nTo be fair, a lot of those pictures I thought were Julian Assange\n\n22:07.680 --> 22:10.680\nand a friend of mine from high school.\n\n22:10.680 --> 22:16.680\nAnd I was like, I don't know, I go by like hats and eyebrows.\n\n22:16.680 --> 22:18.680\nI don't know.\n\n22:18.680 --> 22:20.680\nI'm happy to admit I'm racist.\n\n22:20.680 --> 22:23.680\nNot happy, I'm sad, but I also don't want to fight.\n\n22:23.680 --> 22:25.680\nBut you're not a bigot.\n\n22:25.680 --> 22:28.680\nYou don't believe that one race is better than the other,\n\n22:28.680 --> 22:29.680\nor some are worse than the other.\n\n22:29.680 --> 22:32.680\nI don't even think that's a tenable form of racism anymore.\n\n22:32.680 --> 22:34.680\nThat's self-defeating racism.\n\n22:34.680 --> 22:39.680\nA true racist would simply hang back and notice race.\n\n22:39.680 --> 22:41.680\nAnd so I guess I'm one of them.\n\n22:41.680 --> 22:42.680\nI didn't want to be.\n\n22:42.680 --> 22:43.680\nI don't want to be.\n\n22:43.680 --> 22:44.680\nI hate it.\n\n22:44.680 --> 22:47.680\nI wish I could whip this white skin off my skeleton\n\n22:47.680 --> 22:50.680\nand throw it in the race garbage.\n\n22:50.680 --> 22:54.680\nAnd God will ensure that that happens.\n\n22:54.680 --> 22:56.680\nBut in the meantime, I'm a holdover.\n\n22:56.680 --> 22:59.680\nI'm a strange skeleton in your museum.\n\n22:59.680 --> 23:03.680\nI'm like, race, notice her.\n\n23:03.680 --> 23:05.680\nThat's it.\n\n23:05.680 --> 23:06.680\nI feel like you're hanging up about race.\n\n23:06.680 --> 23:09.680\nIt's also that you're hanging up about men, women, me, you,\n\n23:09.680 --> 23:11.680\nthe stranger, the friend.\n\n23:11.680 --> 23:14.680\nIt's all about other.\n\n23:14.680 --> 23:16.680\nNot xenophobic is the word, maybe.\n\n23:16.680 --> 23:20.680\nBut it's like strangers, you have a reaction to it.\n\n23:20.680 --> 23:22.680\nAnybody to the extent that they're different from you,\n\n23:22.680 --> 23:26.680\nespecially visually, look at the look he's giving me right now.\n\n23:26.680 --> 23:27.680\nNo, I'm live.\n\n23:27.680 --> 23:31.680\nBut you have a reaction because you feel like it reflects on you\n\n23:31.680 --> 23:32.680\nin some way.\n\n23:32.680 --> 23:34.680\nYou take an Asian guy walking into the room personally,\n\n23:34.680 --> 23:37.680\nnot because you think that he's bad.\n\n23:37.680 --> 23:40.680\nWell, they're usually there to kill me.\n\n23:40.680 --> 23:43.680\nAt my behest, I hired them to train me.\n\n23:43.680 --> 23:47.680\nYes.\n\n23:47.680 --> 23:48.680\nPink Panther.\n\n23:48.680 --> 23:50.680\nThank you, Evan Shapiro, probably.\n\n23:50.680 --> 23:53.680\nI'm assuming that was Evan.\n\n23:53.680 --> 23:55.680\nHe's a curator.\n\n23:55.680 --> 23:59.680\nEveryone else is like, date line, TMZ.\n\n23:59.680 --> 24:00.680\nHe confirmed it.\n\n24:00.680 --> 24:02.680\nHe's racist.\n\n24:02.680 --> 24:05.680\nThis will get buried on page six for sure.\n\n24:05.680 --> 24:08.680\nWhat do I got to do to get on the front page?\n\n24:08.680 --> 24:11.680\nWhat were we talking about?\n\n24:11.680 --> 24:15.680\nOh, so there's a lot of Germans in the hotel.\n\n24:15.680 --> 24:17.680\nHere we go.\n\n24:17.680 --> 24:19.680\nHere we go.\n\n24:19.680 --> 24:22.680\nI don't know if this is going to be a satisfying story.\n\n24:22.680 --> 24:25.680\nYou're saying that there's a large German contingent dwelling\n\n24:25.680 --> 24:27.680\nin a hotel right now?\n\n24:27.680 --> 24:31.680\nI don't know if it's a ski team or something happening at the hotel.\n\n24:31.680 --> 24:34.680\nIt could be a convention of bankers.\n\n24:34.680 --> 24:37.680\nIt could be all sorts of things.\n\n24:37.680 --> 24:39.680\nI'm just saying that I'm walking around\n\n24:39.680 --> 24:41.680\nand I'm seeing a lot of blond people\n\n24:41.680 --> 24:44.680\nand I'm hearing like shogun, fugun, shogun shogun on the tower.\n\n24:44.680 --> 24:47.680\nShogun, fugun, shogun, fugun, shogun shogun,\n\n24:47.680 --> 24:50.680\nmaybe you're putting stuff on me.\n\n24:50.680 --> 24:54.680\nI came out of my hotel and I got to the elevator\n\n24:54.680 --> 24:58.680\nand there was a couple and they were waiting for the elevator, too.\n\n24:58.680 --> 25:01.520\nfor the elevator too, but they hadn't pushed the button.\n\n25:01.520 --> 25:04.240\nAnd I don't know, if it's a German stereotype\n\n25:04.240 --> 25:06.080\nthat they just thought that the elevator\n\n25:06.080 --> 25:08.280\nshould heed their call, I don't know.\n\n25:08.280 --> 25:10.480\nThat's not, I'm sure Germans are sick of that stereotype,\n\n25:10.480 --> 25:12.280\nbut I pushed it for them.\n\n25:12.280 --> 25:15.560\nAnd then it, but while they were having\n\n25:15.560 --> 25:17.120\nthis very hushed conversation, he was like,\n\n25:17.120 --> 25:22.480\nshingam, flim, shingam, flim, shimam, flim, flim, flim,\n\n25:22.480 --> 25:24.080\nand she's like, shingam, flim, flim,\n\n25:24.080 --> 25:26.160\nflim, flim, flim, shimam, flim, flim,\n\n25:26.160 --> 25:28.240\nand I'm like, okay, they're German, I think.\n\n25:28.240 --> 25:30.160\nThere could be anything, there's 800 countries\n\n25:30.160 --> 25:31.440\nwho cares about any of them.\n\n25:31.440 --> 25:33.480\nThe, unless you're gonna bomb one,\n\n25:33.480 --> 25:34.920\nand then it's like, well, what do they have?\n\n25:34.920 --> 25:37.480\nThe, but they get into the elevator,\n\n25:37.480 --> 25:40.080\nbut he waits for her to get in,\n\n25:40.080 --> 25:42.760\nand then he waits for me to get in.\n\n25:42.760 --> 25:45.920\nSo I'm like, all right, like some weird\n\n25:45.920 --> 25:50.920\nGerman emasculation technique, and I kind of step in.\n\n25:50.920 --> 25:52.080\nOh, because he's letting you on.\n\n25:52.080 --> 25:56.200\nWell, he let his wife or a partner or a sister,\n\n25:56.200 --> 25:58.640\nbut I don't know, I'm not assuming anything,\n\n25:58.640 --> 26:00.000\nbut he let her on.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:02.760\nBy the way, according to,\n\n26:06.360 --> 26:07.200\nwhat is it, Tia?\n\n26:07.200 --> 26:08.840\nDon't say Himmler.\n\n26:10.120 --> 26:12.720\nNo, the elevator, you would be surprised\n\n26:12.720 --> 26:14.880\nat what is actually etiquette for elevator.\n\n26:14.880 --> 26:16.520\nThe old school etiquette, like back in the early days\n\n26:16.520 --> 26:18.040\nwhen elevators were a new thing,\n\n26:18.040 --> 26:21.200\nit was supposed to be that you let the men go on first\n\n26:21.200 --> 26:23.640\nin case it's going to fail, that they will be the ones\n\n26:23.640 --> 26:24.480\nthat die.\n\n26:24.480 --> 26:26.680\nThe etiquette hasn't been actually updated\n\n26:26.680 --> 26:29.200\nsince elevators were dangerous.\n\n26:29.200 --> 26:33.040\nSo it's actually, if you want to go by actual books\n\n26:33.040 --> 26:34.760\nthat have been published on the topic,\n\n26:34.760 --> 26:37.360\nthe actual etiquette is that a man is supposed\n\n26:37.360 --> 26:42.360\nto take the plunge and get onto this disastrous new laser\n\n26:42.760 --> 26:46.000\ntransporter and plummet to his death.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:47.240\nI don't like the one where,\n\n26:47.240 --> 26:48.760\nwhich is the one where the guy is supposed to walk\n\n26:48.760 --> 26:50.960\ncloser to the curb than the woman,\n\n26:50.960 --> 26:52.600\nand they're like, some people say it's because-\n\n26:52.600 --> 26:55.240\nIf it's uphill, and then in case his brake goes out,\n\n26:55.240 --> 26:56.880\nthen he'll just like drift into-\n\n26:56.880 --> 26:58.440\nNo, that's parking, that's parking.\n\n26:58.440 --> 27:02.400\nYeah, you got to turn the woman into the-\n\n27:02.400 --> 27:04.520\nYou have to turn the woman toward the curb,\n\n27:04.520 --> 27:07.560\nlike her back, but everyone always turns her front\n\n27:07.560 --> 27:08.400\ntoward the curb.\n\n27:08.400 --> 27:11.120\nYour woman is going to like slide into the street.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.040\nThat's like, and there could be a car chase\n\n27:14.040 --> 27:16.240\nif you're in San Francisco.\n\n27:16.240 --> 27:17.400\nSteve McQueen's coming to get you.\n\n27:17.400 --> 27:18.920\nYeah, the French connection's going to happen\n\n27:18.920 --> 27:20.320\nand you just lost a woman.\n\n27:20.320 --> 27:22.720\nSo I was like- I didn't know this.\n\n27:22.720 --> 27:25.720\nI was like, I don't know, 18, 17,\n\n27:25.720 --> 27:26.880\nand I was walking down the road,\n\n27:26.880 --> 27:28.680\nand I was, it had been raining out,\n\n27:28.680 --> 27:32.600\nso I was walking on the inside of like the,\n\n27:32.600 --> 27:34.480\nno, no, I was, what was I doing?\n\n27:34.480 --> 27:38.840\nNo, no, she got mad at me for standing on the outside\n\n27:38.840 --> 27:42.360\nbecause that makes her look like a prostitute, right?\n\n27:42.360 --> 27:43.600\nCause you're supposed to walk on the inside,\n\n27:43.600 --> 27:45.240\nor no, the opposite way around?\n\n27:45.240 --> 27:46.960\nI don't know, as puddles as prostitutes,\n\n27:46.960 --> 27:48.480\nI never figured it out.\n\n27:48.480 --> 27:50.600\nYeah, look for Jeff's children's book.\n\n27:50.600 --> 27:53.880\nIt's puddles and prostitutes,\n\n27:53.880 --> 27:56.760\nand you open each page and then you have the kid let go\n\n27:56.760 --> 27:57.880\nand he's supposed to guess.\n\n27:57.880 --> 27:59.000\nIs it a puddle or a prostitute?\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.360\nIf you're a pimp, if you're a pimp-\n\n28:00.360 --> 28:02.400\nI'm collected from the heavens.\n\n28:02.400 --> 28:04.360\nPuddle, no, prostitute.\n\n28:05.680 --> 28:07.360\nWorld's oldest profession.\n\n28:07.360 --> 28:10.120\nI'm content with the lowest places.\n\n28:10.120 --> 28:10.960\nPuddle.\n\n28:10.960 --> 28:12.960\nAnyways, so I got in the elevator, and then it was just\n\n28:12.960 --> 28:15.960\nvery quiet, I don't know if, I don't know if they were\n\n28:15.960 --> 28:20.960\nhaving a thing, like it was terse or if that's just German\n\n28:21.480 --> 28:32.720\nregular stuff, like, like, like, like.\n\n28:32.720 --> 28:34.840\nDid they, did they seem to be family or?\n\n28:34.840 --> 28:38.240\nWell, yeah, it's my perception, but I'm American,\n\n28:38.240 --> 28:41.360\nso my perception is that God should be on your money\n\n28:41.360 --> 28:43.240\nand everybody should go fuck themselves.\n\n28:43.240 --> 28:45.200\nMy perception is fucking retarded.\n\n28:45.200 --> 28:46.360\nOh, shit, god damn it.\n\n28:47.560 --> 28:50.680\nMy perception is that that word, my sister's retarded,\n\n28:50.680 --> 28:55.320\nand she just, she just moved in with a woman\n\n28:55.320 --> 28:58.040\nand who used to be a man, so fuck all of you, I wrote it.\n\n28:58.040 --> 29:02.560\nAll right, get out, get out, pull up, pull up.\n\n29:02.560 --> 29:04.560\nThe show brought to you by a Bud Light.\n\n29:04.560 --> 29:09.560\nAll right, the, it was terse in the elevator\n\n29:10.240 --> 29:11.480\nand I wasn't sure, I don't know,\n\n29:11.480 --> 29:13.560\nbecause there's a stereotype of the German people,\n\n29:13.560 --> 29:16.160\nI don't know, but they were quiet.\n\n29:16.160 --> 29:19.800\nBut here's, and then so, then we ride down in silence\n\n29:19.800 --> 29:24.800\nand he's wearing like a ski jacket and she stared forward\n\n29:24.800 --> 29:27.600\nand he was sort of like 45 degree angle\n\n29:27.600 --> 29:31.040\nand I'm staring forward too and I'm at the door\n\n29:31.040 --> 29:36.040\nand it goes boom, boom, boom, lobby, opens up\n\n29:38.840 --> 29:42.640\nand it's just a pause and then she steps out\n\n29:42.640 --> 29:43.880\nand then I'm just waiting\n\n29:43.880 --> 29:46.040\nbecause now this thing happened up there\n\n29:46.040 --> 29:49.240\nand then I look over at him and he's facing\n\n29:49.240 --> 29:53.040\nand he goes like this, he goes please.\n\n29:55.920 --> 29:59.680\nAnd I fucked off, like it was like Hans Gruber,\n\n29:59.680 --> 30:02.760\nlike please, he just gritted his teeth\n\n30:02.760 --> 30:04.480\nand closed his eyes, please.\n\n30:05.680 --> 30:08.080\nGive me three seconds away from her.\n\n30:08.080 --> 30:10.680\nNo, no, no wonder they didn't laugh.\n\n30:10.680 --> 30:12.000\nThey all thought some weird thing.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:13.280\nNo, I'm saying the guy was like,\n\n30:13.280 --> 30:15.320\nplease get the fuck off the elevator.\n\n30:15.320 --> 30:16.160\nOh, that's it.\n\n30:16.160 --> 30:17.520\nAll right, not a good story then I guess.\n\n30:17.520 --> 30:18.520\nNo, it doesn't matter.\n\n30:18.520 --> 30:20.400\nI was in the same elevator today,\n\n30:20.400 --> 30:22.360\ngoing up to my hotel room at the same hotel\n\n30:22.360 --> 30:24.360\nand there was a family of French people\n\n30:24.360 --> 30:27.400\nand they were clearly my mother, father and child.\n\n30:27.400 --> 30:30.880\nAnd I think there were two like teenage children\n\n30:30.880 --> 30:32.240\nand they were all like kind of giggling\n\n30:32.240 --> 30:35.760\nand laughing in French, which I only know a few words of.\n\n30:35.760 --> 30:37.960\nAnd they were kind of laughing\n\n30:37.960 --> 30:40.440\nand then I came in and hit my button\n\n30:40.440 --> 30:42.200\nbut it didn't work, you had to put the card back in\n\n30:42.200 --> 30:44.160\nso the wife kept putting the card in\n\n30:44.160 --> 30:45.320\nand I kept hitting the button\n\n30:45.320 --> 30:47.360\nbut then somebody would come in and like,\n\n30:47.360 --> 30:48.360\noh, can I stop the elevator?\n\n30:48.360 --> 30:49.600\nWe had to keep doing it.\n\n30:49.600 --> 30:51.560\nAnd so I kind of made a joke.\n\n30:51.560 --> 30:53.440\nBefore I knew they were all French.\n\n30:53.440 --> 30:54.280\nI hadn't heard any French.\n\n30:54.280 --> 30:55.680\nSo now we're going up and the guy goes,\n\n30:55.680 --> 30:57.680\nah, he's in the CBD because I'm thinking\n\n30:57.680 --> 30:59.680\nhe's a good pa.\n\n30:59.680 --> 31:03.240\nWhich, that's what not, pa means not.\n\n31:03.240 --> 31:04.080\nRight.\n\n31:04.080 --> 31:05.200\nYeah, so then they all kind of giggled\n\n31:05.200 --> 31:08.000\nand I kind of went, I kind of gave him a smile.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.040\nThen they went quiet for a while\n\n31:09.040 --> 31:11.000\nand then he made another joke\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.800\nand they all kind of sheepishly giggled.\n\n31:13.800 --> 31:15.560\nI looked back around and I was like,\n\n31:15.560 --> 31:19.280\neh, like kind of like, you know,\n\n31:19.280 --> 31:20.400\nI get it all the time or whatever\n\n31:20.400 --> 31:22.240\nbecause now they're talking about me.\n\n31:22.240 --> 31:23.880\nAnd it happens three times.\n\n31:23.880 --> 31:25.120\nI get off the elevator, I go,\n\n31:25.120 --> 31:26.400\nboss one and they're like, all right.\n\n31:26.400 --> 31:28.400\nWhoa, he knows.\n\n31:28.400 --> 31:30.360\nHe knows everything we said.\n\n31:30.360 --> 31:32.160\nWe were throwing him what we thought\n\n31:32.160 --> 31:34.280\nwas cryptic French shade.\n\n31:37.280 --> 31:38.920\nOh, look at this guy, he's wearing the jacket.\n\n31:38.920 --> 31:40.200\nHe's wearing the shoes, he's wearing the socks,\n\n31:40.200 --> 31:41.160\nhe's wearing the jacket.\n\n31:41.160 --> 31:42.000\nNot.\n\n31:43.360 --> 31:46.360\nAnd everyone's like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n31:46.360 --> 31:47.760\nI think bread is breakfast.\n\n31:52.160 --> 31:54.440\nAnd yet we're thin, I don't know why.\n\n31:54.440 --> 31:55.840\nWell, it's probably because the bread\n\n31:55.840 --> 32:00.000\nisn't made by Tyson Foods, a big sponsor of CISO.\n\n32:01.920 --> 32:05.160\nThey figured out how to make making bread inhumane.\n\n32:05.160 --> 32:10.160\nTyson, there's just bigger factories full of bread.\n\n32:10.760 --> 32:14.480\nLike you thought yeast was beyond mistreatment,\n\n32:14.480 --> 32:16.880\nbut you should see the videos, YouTube it.\n\n32:16.880 --> 32:19.520\nIt's just guys like stabbing with toothpicks,\n\n32:19.520 --> 32:21.480\njust like, hey, yeast.\n\n32:21.480 --> 32:23.200\nAnd they're just like hitting the yeast\n\n32:23.200 --> 32:25.400\nand the yeast is like, ow, ow.\n\n32:25.400 --> 32:27.000\nLike they've found more things\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.600\nabout yeast capacity for intelligence,\n\n32:29.600 --> 32:30.600\njust from the abuse.\n\n32:30.600 --> 32:32.920\nThey found out that yeast consume more sugars\n\n32:32.920 --> 32:34.360\nand give off more carbon dioxide\n\n32:34.360 --> 32:36.000\nif they're living in a state of terror.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nYes, and it's more delicious.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:39.440\nHave you ever had a great cookie?\n\n32:39.440 --> 32:41.320\nThat yeast died scared.\n\n32:41.320 --> 32:46.320\nSo complain all you want, but I guess fuck Christmas.\n\n32:46.400 --> 32:48.720\nIf, you know, I don't know.\n\n32:48.720 --> 32:50.640\nLike just think about it for a little bit.\n\n32:50.640 --> 32:53.840\nYou're New Yorkers, you probably aren't familiar\n\n32:53.840 --> 32:56.720\nwith complication or dichotomy.\n\n32:58.920 --> 33:03.160\nHey, hey, this probably isn't like a new thing,\n\n33:03.160 --> 33:08.160\nbut there was a country station playing on the thing.\n\n33:08.960 --> 33:11.320\nSo country, so do we have any country,\n\n33:11.320 --> 33:13.000\nWestern singers in here?\n\n33:14.960 --> 33:17.640\nAnybody here been in a country band?\n\n33:17.640 --> 33:18.560\nCountry music?\n\n33:18.560 --> 33:20.480\nYeah, it's not a big city for that, I guess,\n\n33:20.480 --> 33:24.320\nbut I just want to, I just, I'm just parsing this.\n\n33:24.320 --> 33:25.920\nLike I, because I've never really paid attention.\n\n33:25.920 --> 33:28.560\nSo the idea is I listen to three country songs in a row.\n\n33:28.560 --> 33:33.560\nSo the idea is, so you love outlaws because you have to,\n\n33:35.800 --> 33:39.600\nbut also the Bible because you have to,\n\n33:40.360 --> 33:45.040\nand chicken and beer because you have to,\n\n33:45.040 --> 33:46.240\nand then just freedom.\n\n33:47.720 --> 33:50.040\nBut the freedom is the most important thing.\n\n33:50.040 --> 33:55.040\nThe freedom to like the Bible and outlaws?\n\n33:55.160 --> 33:58.000\nLike what is the, I don't understand, like the,\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:03.000\nI like all my fans are outlaws and the outlaw style is here.\n\n34:03.320 --> 34:05.680\nWe like to go shopping at Kmart.\n\n34:05.680 --> 34:07.920\nAnd like, I'm not the first person to point this out,\n\n34:07.920 --> 34:09.880\nbut it's like, how could they be?\n\n34:09.880 --> 34:13.520\nSo that's terrible, like I feel bad for them.\n\n34:13.520 --> 34:15.360\nThey're like, I like, I'm on outlaw,\n\n34:15.360 --> 34:17.840\nbut I like the Bible.\n\n34:17.840 --> 34:20.920\nYeah, and the constitution, second amendment.\n\n34:20.920 --> 34:22.680\nBut I like, and I like bad nutrition.\n\n34:22.680 --> 34:24.040\nAnd I like, I mean, I do too,\n\n34:24.040 --> 34:26.280\nbut I don't consider that outlaw behavior.\n\n34:26.280 --> 34:27.720\nI consider that actually the moments\n\n34:27.720 --> 34:29.280\nwhen I'm most capitulating.\n\n34:29.280 --> 34:31.920\nHow would you align yourself more of an outlaw or more?\n\n34:31.920 --> 34:35.480\nMore of a, just a guy, I'm just like a pig at a trough.\n\n34:35.480 --> 34:36.480\nAnd I'm like proud of it.\n\n34:36.480 --> 34:37.840\nAnd I'm like, this is good.\n\n34:37.840 --> 34:41.360\nLike, like, like, like CISO, Suey, like, like, like,\n\n34:41.360 --> 34:43.280\nI just like, it's delicious.\n\n34:43.280 --> 34:44.600\nLike who made corn for me?\n\n34:44.600 --> 34:45.720\nI love being a pig.\n\n34:45.720 --> 34:49.360\nLike, I don't, I never go like, plus I'm an outlaw.\n\n34:49.360 --> 34:51.000\nCause I would feel dumb if I did that.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.200\nI think that would be dumb.\n\n34:52.200 --> 34:54.160\nLike, I don't think an outlaw should even be talking\n\n34:54.160 --> 34:55.000\ninto a microphone.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:56.880\nLike, like, like to an outlaw, he'd be like,\n\n34:56.880 --> 34:58.960\nwhy is this amplifying my voice?\n\n34:58.960 --> 35:00.080\nI'm an outlaw.\n\n35:00.080 --> 35:03.880\nI use, I use, I use lack of law to amplify my intent.\n\n35:04.840 --> 35:08.080\nI don't, it's like, like, like microphones are for politics.\n\n35:08.080 --> 35:10.880\nThey're for guys with big giant mustaches with grease in them.\n\n35:10.880 --> 35:12.800\nLike, like the people that put up telephone poles.\n\n35:12.800 --> 35:13.640\nI'm an outlaw.\n\n35:13.640 --> 35:16.920\nI'm an outlaw, I love, I love not being in the law.\n\n35:16.920 --> 35:18.280\nBut I love the Bible.\n\n35:18.280 --> 35:20.480\nLike, like the Bible, like I love the Bible.\n\n35:20.480 --> 35:22.640\nLike the Bible is like all law.\n\n35:22.640 --> 35:24.760\nLike it's like the, like it's more laws\n\n35:24.760 --> 35:26.200\nthan even just our laws.\n\n35:26.200 --> 35:27.840\nBut it's, like, it's more laws.\n\n35:27.840 --> 35:29.760\nThere's laws in the Bible that aren't even law.\n\n35:29.760 --> 35:30.600\nThe new, the new.\n\n35:30.600 --> 35:31.440\nExtra laws.\n\n35:31.440 --> 35:33.080\nLike, like, you know, remember the kid that was like,\n\n35:33.080 --> 35:34.760\nloved math in school and he's like, I can't,\n\n35:34.760 --> 35:37.280\nI'm gonna spend the summer doing math stuff.\n\n35:37.280 --> 35:38.400\nThat's what the Bible is.\n\n35:38.400 --> 35:40.360\nIt's like extra law.\n\n35:40.360 --> 35:41.960\nBut it's like laws that don't even make sense.\n\n35:41.960 --> 35:44.280\nThe protagonist of the New Testament is an outlaw.\n\n35:44.280 --> 35:45.760\nHe's, he's wanted by the popos.\n\n35:45.760 --> 35:48.040\nYeah, but then there's a whole Bible about him.\n\n35:48.040 --> 35:50.520\nLike they added him to the Bible because he did that.\n\n35:50.520 --> 35:51.520\nIs that what they're hoping?\n\n35:51.520 --> 35:52.640\nThere's going to be a third Testament\n\n35:52.640 --> 35:53.680\nwith Waylon Jennings in it.\n\n35:53.680 --> 35:57.200\nLike, I was like, oh, this is how you do it.\n\n35:57.200 --> 35:58.880\nI'm an outlaw, I'm an outlaw.\n\n35:58.880 --> 36:01.160\nHow come no one's crucifying me?\n\n36:01.160 --> 36:02.000\nYeah.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.560\nI want to throw on a Bible about me.\n\n36:04.560 --> 36:07.960\nAbout how I went shopping and fuck those shits.\n\n36:07.960 --> 36:11.640\nI'm a, I want a Bible about me.\n\n36:11.640 --> 36:14.360\nWell, you're going to have to learn more chords.\n\n36:14.360 --> 36:15.560\nYeah.\n\n36:15.560 --> 36:17.360\nFirst of all, by my definition,\n\n36:17.360 --> 36:18.640\nyou have to learn more chords.\n\n36:18.640 --> 36:21.040\nMaybe the dance moves could use a little punch up.\n\n36:23.720 --> 36:24.560\nHow are we doing on time?\n\n36:24.560 --> 36:26.000\nHave I filled a half hour?\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:27.760\nI think, I don't know what exactly you and I could.\n\n36:27.760 --> 36:31.280\nNo, my goal is to fill a half hour.\n\n36:31.280 --> 36:33.520\nI think we're quite close actually to going on\n\n36:33.520 --> 36:36.280\nto the second segment of our Capulcate of Stars tonight.\n\n36:36.280 --> 36:38.880\nOkay, two more fun anecdotes about my personal life,\n\n36:38.880 --> 36:40.720\nwhich is very uneventful.\n\n36:40.720 --> 36:42.960\nI got into the elevator another time.\n\n36:45.480 --> 36:46.720\nThis is what I do when I come to New York.\n\n36:46.720 --> 36:49.400\nThis show is a rich tapestry of ideas.\n\n36:50.120 --> 36:54.760\nAnd I, my room is, I'm not even going to change the numbers.\n\n36:54.760 --> 36:57.440\nIf you want to come kill me, just come kill me.\n\n36:57.440 --> 36:59.400\nMy, because I wouldn't know how to riff\n\n36:59.400 --> 37:01.600\na palindromic number like this.\n\n37:01.600 --> 37:05.680\nI, my room is 611, but I got the thing and it's upside down.\n\n37:05.680 --> 37:07.960\nIt's, I thought, I thought I was in room 119.\n\n37:07.960 --> 37:09.760\nSo I'm like, wait, one, I've never been,\n\n37:09.760 --> 37:10.840\nso it's, it's New York.\n\n37:10.840 --> 37:13.160\nI bet the one is like up because it's New York,\n\n37:13.160 --> 37:14.240\nbecause everything's vertical.\n\n37:14.240 --> 37:15.600\nLike you go to Walgreens and it's like,\n\n37:15.600 --> 37:17.800\nvitamins are 30 miles in the sky.\n\n37:17.800 --> 37:20.680\nThe, the, so I was like, I got in the elevator\n\n37:20.680 --> 37:22.000\nand there was just two women in there\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:23.080\nand I was just like, I don't know.\n\n37:23.080 --> 37:24.200\nThere's no one button.\n\n37:24.200 --> 37:25.920\nAnd then like it opened on four\n\n37:25.920 --> 37:28.120\nand there was just some kid with like a luggage rack.\n\n37:28.120 --> 37:31.880\nAnd, and I said, hey, hi, how'd it work?\n\n37:31.880 --> 37:34.800\nWould you mind, how do you, how do you get to one?\n\n37:34.800 --> 37:35.640\nAnd he's like, what?\n\n37:35.640 --> 37:37.640\nAnd I'm like, what did, what, 119?\n\n37:37.640 --> 37:38.760\nI don't know where to go.\n\n37:38.760 --> 37:39.960\nAnd I held up the thing and he's like,\n\n37:39.960 --> 37:43.000\nI think that's 6'11 and I turned it upside down\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:44.960\nand I was like, ah, and the door's closed\n\n37:44.960 --> 37:47.640\nand I turned to the ladies having been raised\n\n37:47.640 --> 37:50.600\non television and movies and I said, I don't get out much.\n\n37:50.600 --> 37:54.400\nSo like, if you don't get out much,\n\n37:54.400 --> 37:57.080\nthe one thing that you might be adept at\n\n37:57.080 --> 37:59.480\nis number reading.\n\n37:59.480 --> 38:00.920\nThat's the one thing you can practice\n\n38:00.920 --> 38:02.760\nwithout getting out much.\n\n38:02.760 --> 38:03.720\nI just saw that was funny.\n\n38:03.720 --> 38:04.800\nI don't get out much.\n\n38:04.800 --> 38:06.320\nYeah, you don't get out so much\n\n38:06.320 --> 38:08.520\nthat you use the line, I don't get out much.\n\n38:08.520 --> 38:10.920\nAnd you think that that's just gonna like make sense\n\n38:10.920 --> 38:11.760\nand it doesn't.\n\n38:11.760 --> 38:12.600\nThey're French.\n\n38:12.600 --> 38:14.760\nThey're like, and the other one was like,\n\n38:14.760 --> 38:17.320\nI'm gonna suck up, and the other one was like,\n\n38:17.320 --> 38:18.160\nI surrender.\n\n38:19.240 --> 38:21.120\nAnd I was like, I'll step in,\n\n38:21.120 --> 38:23.200\nbut it's gonna cost you $70 trillion.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:27.240\nIt's part of a 50 year plan.\n\n38:27.240 --> 38:29.080\nDon't worry, we'll be

it down to 20 minutes.\n\n46:51.080 --> 46:53.080\nHere, you're gonna see us play only 10 minutes.\n\n46:53.080 --> 46:54.560\nSo figure it out.\n\n46:56.400 --> 46:58.120\nHe takes it seriously is the point.\n\n46:58.120 --> 46:59.760\nYeah, no, that's my job.\n\n46:59.760 --> 47:03.240\nYou saw that documentary about the guy that dreams of sushi\n\n47:03.240 --> 47:05.480\nand then makes a really high maintenance meal for you.\n\n47:05.480 --> 47:06.840\nAnd it costs $700.\n\n47:06.840 --> 47:08.000\nAnd the whole time you're sitting there going,\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.080\nI hope I don't eat this wrong.\n\n47:10.080 --> 47:11.760\nIt's artisanal.\n\n47:11.760 --> 47:13.800\nI should charge $700 for this.\n\n47:13.800 --> 47:15.560\nThat's insane.\n\n47:15.560 --> 47:17.640\nIs that really what you pay for sushi?\n\n47:17.640 --> 47:18.480\nYeah.\n\n47:18.480 --> 47:20.080\nYou guys are fucking idiots.\n\n47:20.080 --> 47:20.920\nI'm sure it's.\n\n47:22.120 -->

47:35.080\nWe'll get a chance to start.\n\n47:35.080 --> 47:36.560\nThen we'll go party.\n\n47:36.560 --> 47:37.400\nOh my gosh.\n\n47:37.400 --> 47:38.240\nAll right.\n\n47:38.240 --> 47:39.060\nI'm just gonna start.\n\n47:39.060 --> 47:39.900\nOkay.\n\n47:39.900 --> 47:41.720\nDan, you're playing a character named Fondue.\n\n47:41.720 --> 47:43.520\nJeff, you're playing a character named Bone Weevil.\n\n47:43.520 --> 47:44.360\nI can do it.\n\n47:44.360 --> 47:45.200\nBone Weevil.\n\n47:45.200 --> 47:46.480\nFondue and Bone Weevil.\n\n47:46.480 --> 47:48.840\nYou're at the Earthscar Ale House,\n\n47:48.840 --> 47:51.600\nthe local tavern around these parts.\n\n47:51.600 --> 47:53.760\nIt's a dreary place for the lost souls\n\n47:53.760 --> 47:56.720\nthat wander through town enjoying the strong bruise\n\n47:56.720 --> 47:58.080\nin dark corners.\n\n47:58.080 --> 47:59.680\nYou're sad at the bar.\n\n48:00.720 --> 48:01.840\nHey, Fondue.\n\n48:01.840 --> 48:02.680\nWhoa.\n\n48:02.680 --> 48:03.560\nI'm really drunk.\n\n48:03.560 --> 48:05.040\nI'm really drunk right now.\n\n48:05.040 --> 48:05.880\nDo I know him?\n\n48:05.880 --> 48:06.700\nYeah.\n\n48:06.700 --> 48:07.540\nHey.\n\n48:07.540 --> 48:08.360\nWhat do you mean?\n\n48:08.360 --> 48:09.200\nDo you know me?\n\n48:09.200 --> 48:10.040\nI wasn't talking to you.\n\n48:10.040 --> 48:10.880\nYou know me.\n\n48:10.880 --> 48:11.720\nI didn't say that out loud.\n\n48:11.720 --> 48:12.560\nHuh?\n\n48:12.560 --> 48:13.400\nDude.\n\n48:14.520 --> 48:15.360\nAll right.\n\n48:16.760 --> 48:18.040\nI mean, we don't know each other well,\n\n48:18.040 --> 48:20.000\nbut we come to the same bar all the time.\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:21.960\nWe speak, but you're always in a blackout drunk.\n\n48:21.960 --> 48:22.800\nYou're a giant.\n\n48:22.800 --> 48:23.920\nWhat are you, a half-orc or something?\n\n48:23.920 --> 48:24.920\nYeah.\n\n48:24.920 --> 48:25.760\nYeah.\n\n48:25.760 --> 48:27.080\nLook, I'm just a little goblin.\n\n48:27.080 --> 48:29.760\nI'm just a little, probably what, three feet?\n\n48:29.760 --> 48:32.560\nBut your conversation is interrupted by the arrival\n\n48:32.560 --> 48:33.600\nof two gentlemen.\n\n48:33.600 --> 48:34.440\nOh, shit.\n\n48:34.440 --> 48:35.280\nOh.\n\n48:35.280 --> 48:39.240\nYou see two brothers with matching facial tattoos.\n\n48:39.240 --> 48:40.440\nActually, they're not brothers.\n\n48:40.440 --> 48:42.120\nThey're clearly of different races.\n\n48:42.120 --> 48:44.360\nOne's a half-orc and one's an elf.\n\n48:44.360 --> 48:45.200\nOh.\n\n48:45.200 --> 48:46.040\nOh.\n\n48:46.040 --> 48:46.880\nHark, harkin.\n\n48:46.880 --> 48:47.720\nIs that, do we say that?\n\n48:47.720 --> 48:48.560\nYeah.\n\n48:48.560 --> 48:49.400\nHark, hark, hello.\n\n48:49.400 --> 48:50.480\nHark, harkin, hello.\n\n48:50.480 --> 48:53.480\nWe are seeking the crown of the rat king,\n\n48:53.480 --> 48:57.600\nwhich might be found in the tomb of the rat king.\n\n48:57.600 --> 49:01.160\nFor I am divorceeous.\n\n49:01.160 --> 49:05.400\nAnd I am, it's for the bestiest.\n\n49:05.400 --> 49:05.880\nWow.\n\n49:05.880 --> 49:07.320\nYes.\n\n49:07.320 --> 49:09.560\nGuys, I pulled them aside and I go,\n\n49:09.560 --> 49:13.880\nwhoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.\n\n49:13.880 --> 49:18.120\nDo you know where the rat king tomb be?\n\n49:18.120 --> 49:23.840\nI have heard that it is in the tomb of the rat king.\n\n49:23.840 --> 49:26.000\nThat's what I heard.\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nBut Joe Smigeggy told me.\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:32.960\nI use my knowledge of nature or the local area.\n\n49:32.960 --> 49:34.560\nDo I know where the rat tomb is, Spencer?\n\n49:34.560 --> 49:35.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.320\nNo, everybody knows that the tomb of the rat king\n\n49:37.320 --> 49:39.680\nis in the forest outside of town.\n\n49:39.680 --> 49:42.960\nI say we put our drinks down and get the hell over there.\n\n49:42.960 --> 49:44.680\nAnd what are we looking for again in the thing?\n\n49:44.680 --> 49:47.440\nWe're trying to find the crown of the rat king.\n\n49:47.440 --> 49:50.440\nAnd when we get there, we're going to split the money.\n\n49:50.440 --> 49:51.120\nYeah.\n\n49:51.120 --> 49:51.760\nOK.\n\n49:51.760 --> 49:53.760\nOK, now it's good to say these things.\n\n49:53.760 --> 49:54.480\nIt's like a divorce.\n\n49:54.480 --> 49:57.200\nYou want to get this stuff set up before you get into it.\n\n49:57.200 --> 49:59.440\nIt's like a prenup for an adventure.\n\n49:59.440 --> 50:00.440\nRight.\n\n50:00.440 --> 50:03.200\nWell, normally, there'd be more of a refusal of the call,\n\n50:03.200 --> 50:04.560\nwhich would result in immersiveness,\n\n50:04.560 --> 50:05.960\nbut this is more like a porno.\n\n50:05.960 --> 50:07.960\nSo let's just quit.\n\n50:07.960 --> 50:08.920\nMy synth's clogged.\n\n50:08.920 --> 50:09.440\nLet's front.\n\n50:09.440 --> 50:10.040\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n50:10.040 --> 50:10.720\nAll right.\n\n50:10.720 --> 50:12.920\nFront do, front refuse the call.\n\n50:12.920 --> 50:14.400\nI don't know if I should do it.\n\n50:14.400 --> 50:15.680\nAll right, let's go.\n\n50:15.680 --> 50:17.480\nYeah, yeah.\n\n50:17.480 --> 50:20.160\nHe reads my eyes.\n\n50:20.160 --> 50:25.760\nI have a wagon outside with a couple mules.\n\n50:25.760 --> 50:26.920\nYou just want to get in my wagon?\n\n50:26.920 --> 50:29.200\nHow many wheels does this wagon have?\n\n50:29.200 --> 50:30.240\nIt's a two-wheeled wagon.\n\n50:30.240 --> 50:31.240\nIt's not a great wagon.\n\n50:31.240 --> 50:34.040\nIt's what horses are the front wheels, basically.\n\n50:34.040 --> 50:35.400\nWe're not used to those.\n\n50:35.400 --> 50:36.680\nDo you have horse-wield wagons?\n\n50:36.680 --> 50:39.320\nNo, the horses work as front wheels.\n\n50:39.320 --> 50:42.560\nTwo wheels just fall over, but the horses hold it up.\n\n50:42.560 --> 50:44.520\nIs there a safety harness on this wagon\n\n50:44.520 --> 50:45.400\nto ensure that I do it?\n\n50:45.400 --> 50:46.680\nOtherwise, the things would fall off.\n\n50:46.680 --> 50:48.640\nI say we get in it for the money shot.\n\n50:48.640 --> 50:49.200\nLet's go.\n\n50:49.200 --> 50:49.800\nLet's do it.\n\n50:49.800 --> 50:51.240\nWe shall go for the shot of money.\n\n50:51.240 --> 50:55.000\nI have a few more questions about the safety\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:56.080\nfeatures of this wagon.\n\n50:56.080 --> 50:58.480\nHey, should we collide with a tree?\n\n50:58.480 --> 51:00.320\nYou already refused the call back in the bar.\n\n51:00.320 --> 51:01.800\nYou don't get to refuse the wagon.\n\n51:01.800 --> 51:03.560\nAll right, I'll get in the wagon.\n\n51:03.560 --> 51:04.440\nYeah, mules.\n\n51:04.440 --> 51:06.680\nOh, whoa.\n\n51:06.680 --> 51:07.280\nWow.\n\n51:07.280 --> 51:08.600\nRight, pretty smooth, doesn't it?\n\n51:08.600 --> 51:09.280\nYeah, pretty smooth.\n\n51:09.280 --> 51:10.280\nTwo-wheeled affair.\n\n51:10.280 --> 51:12.600\nHow do you reach the, you're so small.\n\n51:12.600 --> 51:13.840\nHow do you reach the?\n\n51:13.840 --> 51:15.800\nHorses do all the reach.\n\n51:15.800 --> 51:18.600\nI just take a little whip and hit their butts.\n\n51:18.600 --> 51:22.680\nCan we hit a tree to taste the harness or to test it?\n\n51:22.680 --> 51:23.360\nAnd taste it.\n\n51:23.360 --> 51:25.040\nI'd like to taste the harness.\n\n51:25.040 --> 51:27.200\nMy brother needs to taste the harness.\n\n51:27.200 --> 51:31.640\nSoon you find yourselves outside of the Rat King's tomb.\n\n51:31.640 --> 51:32.440\nOh, shit.\n\n51:32.440 --> 51:35.400\nYou're standing in front of a massive slab of obsidian\n\n51:35.400 --> 51:36.800\nin the forest outside of town.\n\n51:36.800 --> 51:39.720\nThis black monolith seems to absorb all light,\n\n51:39.720 --> 51:42.200\nand a gray stone door sits in the center\n\n51:42.200 --> 51:44.920\nwith golden script scrawled all over it.\n\n51:44.920 --> 51:46.400\nThere's also a doorknob.\n\n51:46.400 --> 51:50.400\nI don't think we should have left that bar.\n\n51:50.400 --> 51:51.680\nYou drove.\n\n51:51.680 --> 51:53.760\nI'm refusing the call in front of the thing.\n\n51:53.760 --> 51:55.360\nYou can't do that the whole adventure.\n\n51:55.360 --> 51:58.200\nIt's just like an E-Lag Roth movie.\n\n51:58.200 --> 51:59.480\nIt's just people going, don't do it.\n\n51:59.480 --> 52:00.480\nDon't do it.\n\n52:00.480 --> 52:02.160\nMy eyeball.\n\n52:02.160 --> 52:03.720\nAnyways, guys, what do you think?\n\n52:03.720 --> 52:07.000\nYou're the ones who are here.\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:10.040\nI go examine the golden script to see if it's a language I know.\n\n52:10.040 --> 52:11.240\nIt's in Dwarven.\n\n52:11.240 --> 52:12.360\nI speak Dwarven.\n\n52:12.360 --> 52:13.280\nI read the thing.\n\n52:13.280 --> 52:13.760\nOh.\n\n52:13.760 --> 52:16.000\nIt says, touch the door with your left hand\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:19.360\nand then just turn the knob and push.\n\n52:19.360 --> 52:22.280\nI know a trap when I see one, fellas.\n\n52:22.280 --> 52:23.560\nDo I have trap sense?\n\n52:23.560 --> 52:24.040\nYeah.\n\n52:24.040 --> 52:25.120\nWe don't know what you're talking about,\n\n52:25.120 --> 52:26.800\nbecause all that happened to you internally.\n\n52:26.800 --> 52:27.520\nI'm a stickler.\n\n52:27.520 --> 52:28.400\nThat's entertainment.\n\n52:28.400 --> 52:31.040\nI have perception.\n\n52:31.040 --> 52:33.280\nCan I check to see if this is a trap?\n\n52:33.280 --> 52:33.760\nOh, yeah.\n\n52:33.760 --> 52:34.880\nLet me see here.\n\n52:34.880 --> 52:35.800\nYeah.\n\n52:35.800 --> 52:37.120\nAm I going to get a dice roll?\n\n52:37.120 --> 52:37.480\nOh, yeah.\n\n52:37.480 --> 52:37.920\nYou just got it.\n\n52:37.920 --> 52:38.760\nOh, yes.\n\n52:38.760 --> 52:39.640\nFeels good, doesn't it?\n\n52:39.640 --> 52:40.320\nYeah, dice.\n\n52:40.320 --> 52:41.000\nI'm so excited.\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:44.040\nExamining the door, it seems to be highly magical,\n\n52:44.040 --> 52:46.000\nbut not trapped.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:46.600\nThat's good.\n\n52:46.600 --> 52:47.840\nAll right.\n\n52:47.840 --> 52:50.880\nSomebody go put their left hand on it and turn it.\n\n52:50.880 --> 52:52.760\nI shall put my left hand.\n\n52:52.760 --> 52:57.240\nI will not use my stunning fist, but I can, if I want to,\n\n52:57.240 --> 52:58.240\njust letting everyone know.\n\n52:58.240 --> 52:59.400\nYou have a stunning fist?\n\n52:59.400 --> 53:00.040\nYeah.\n\n53:00.040 --> 53:01.400\nCan you talk to us about them a lot?\n\n53:01.400 --> 53:02.560\nCan I see it?\n\n53:02.560 --> 53:03.160\nYes.\n\n53:03.160 --> 53:07.680\nIt will be featured in Room 611 later.\n\n53:07.680 --> 53:09.840\nWow.\n\n53:09.840 --> 53:13.160\nI'll bring the magical lube.\n\n53:13.160 --> 53:13.960\nIt is stunning.\n\n53:13.960 --> 53:19.040\nOh, permission to open door with my left arm.\n\n53:19.040 --> 53:23.200\nDoing those things, you open the door easily.\n\n53:23.200 --> 53:28.320\nIt swings open, revealing a staircase headed downwards.\n\n53:28.320 --> 53:31.480\nAre you there, town boys?\n\n53:31.480 --> 53:35.800\nWhat be your interest in this rat crown?\n\n53:35.800 --> 53:38.360\nWe've heard many legends have never seen your like\n\n53:38.360 --> 53:39.960\nin the tavern.\n\n53:39.960 --> 53:42.760\nFancy talk.\n\n53:42.760 --> 53:43.880\nGame of Thrones talking.\n\n53:43.880 --> 53:45.840\nYes.\n\n53:45.840 --> 53:49.600\nOn my face, do you notice the rat?\n\n53:49.600 --> 53:51.280\nYeah.\n\n53:51.280 --> 53:54.480\nI told that rat one day that I would find his crown.\n\n53:54.480 --> 53:55.600\nNice.\n\n53:55.600 --> 53:58.400\nBut in the meantime, I would tattoo him to my face.\n\n53:58.400 --> 54:00.600\nOh, those are rat tattoos on your face.\n\n54:00.600 --> 54:01.560\nYes, that is correct.\n\n54:01.560 --> 54:03.840\nI was there, and so I was in the background\n\n54:03.840 --> 54:04.800\ntattooing myself, too.\n\n54:04.800 --> 54:06.000\nYeah, he's my bestie.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:09.040\nAnd you met a rat that died, and you\n\n54:09.040 --> 54:12.640\nquest to get his crown back, right?\n\n54:12.640 --> 54:13.600\nYes.\n\n54:13.600 --> 54:15.720\nIt doesn't exactly send a signal to the rats,\n\n54:15.720 --> 54:17.680\ndon't fuck with these people.\n\n54:17.680 --> 54:19.160\nYou kind of ended up worshiping them.\n\n54:19.160 --> 54:19.920\nYes.\n\n54:19.920 --> 54:22.560\nYes, I'm a big rat worshiper.\n\n54:22.560 --> 54:26.360\nYou fed the trolls, as they say on Twitter.\n\n54:26.360 --> 54:27.120\nIndeed, I did.\n\n54:27.120 --> 54:28.840\nYou should take time every once in a while\n\n54:28.840 --> 54:34.480\nto tell non-rats, thank you, I liked my show, too.\n\n54:34.480 --> 54:38.240\nDo a ratio of three to 10 that way when they say.\n\n54:38.240 --> 54:41.720\nI know you only respond to haters, so I guess you won't see this.\n\n54:41.720 --> 54:44.240\nThen you can tell that person, fuck you, you piece of shit.\n\n54:44.240 --> 54:44.740\nYeah.\n\n54:44.740 --> 54:46.760\nI respond positively all the time, you little fuck.\n\n54:46.760 --> 54:49.800\nA fault holds what we know not what you speak of at all.\n\n54:49.800 --> 54:50.720\nNo, not at all.\n\n54:50.720 --> 54:54.000\nI saw angels in a different world where stakes were lower,\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:55.640\nbut anxiety was higher.\n\n54:55.640 --> 54:57.960\nYes.\n\n54:57.960 --> 55:00.600\nSo we're inside the tomb right now, Spencer?\n\n55:00.600 --> 55:01.600\nOh, yeah.\n\n55:01.600 --> 55:03.160\nThis is the staircase, though.\n\n55:03.160 --> 55:05.040\nOh.\n\n55:05.040 --> 55:07.720\nI elect you to proceed first.\n\n55:07.720 --> 55:09.880\nOK, I'm little and agile, and I have dark.\n\n55:09.880 --> 55:10.560\nIs it lit?\n\n55:10.560 --> 55:11.060\nDark?\n\n55:11.060 --> 55:13.560\nOut of the corner of your eyes.\n\n55:13.560 --> 55:17.880\nFondue, you can see as bone weevil heads down the stairs,\n\n55:17.880 --> 55:20.040\nthe brothers, they seem to be drawing their weapons\n\n55:20.040 --> 55:21.120\nas if in ambush.\n\n55:21.120 --> 55:22.440\nStop, bone weevil.\n\n55:22.440 --> 55:24.720\nDon't, these guys, whoa.\n\n55:24.720 --> 55:26.680\nYou believe the rat story, I see.\n\n55:26.680 --> 55:28.560\nNo.\n\n55:28.560 --> 55:29.160\nYes.\n\n55:29.160 --> 55:32.240\nI go back up the stairs.\n\n55:32.240 --> 55:34.400\nYou damn it.\n\n55:34.400 --> 55:35.760\nI only went down a few, I'm little.\n\n55:35.760 --> 55:36.920\nI only went down like three stairs.\n\n55:36.920 --> 55:37.880\nI'm back up.\n\n55:37.880 --> 55:40.600\nEye of acrobatics, can I chase him down?\n\n55:40.600 --> 55:41.720\nI think you went up, though.\n\n55:41.720 --> 55:42.220\nOK.\n\n55:42.220 --> 55:43.240\nI went up.\n\n55:43.240 --> 55:46.240\nOK, I go back down to meet everybody.\n\n55:46.240 --> 55:47.360\nI guess I misheard.\n\n55:47.360 --> 55:49.520\nNo, no, actually, I go down one step\n\n55:49.520 --> 55:53.000\nso I keep a high advantage to level the playing field,\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:54.840\nand I draw my rapier.\n\n55:54.840 --> 55:57.160\nI'm sorry, what was that?\n\n55:57.160 --> 55:57.840\nMy sword.\n\n55:57.840 --> 55:59.440\nOh.\n\n55:59.440 --> 56:02.240\nIt's spelled rapier, but it's just a sword.\n\n56:02.240 --> 56:04.840\nIt's not that kind of crowd that's been established.\n\n56:04.840 --> 56:07.360\nI apologize.\n\n56:07.360 --> 56:11.760\nI shall put my stunning fists away.\n\n56:11.760 --> 56:13.280\nI think they like stunning fists.\n\n56:13.280 --> 56:14.200\nNo, they like that.\n\n56:14.200 --> 56:14.700\nOh.\n\n56:14.700 --> 56:15.520\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n56:15.520 --> 56:16.360\nYou're Kevin James.\n\n56:16.360 --> 56:17.400\nYou're at home jerking off.\n\n56:17.400 --> 56:17.960\nThat's fine.\n\n56:17.960 --> 56:20.280\nTotally.\n\n56:20.280 --> 56:22.400\nYou guys are in some sort of standoff situation.\n\n56:22.400 --> 56:24.880\nAh!\n\n56:24.880 --> 56:27.440\nWell, drop your weapons.\n\n56:27.440 --> 56:29.200\nI draw my bastard sword.\n\n56:29.200 --> 56:30.360\nAll right.\n\n56:30.360 --> 56:31.360\nNow everyone is drawn.\n\n56:31.360 --> 56:33.640\nNot everybody has to die here today.\n\n56:33.640 --> 56:36.120\nIn fact, nobody has to.\n\n56:36.120 --> 56:38.440\nI offer a tree token.\n\n56:42.240 --> 56:45.000\nIt's a strange ambush tactic.\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:46.760\nYes.\n\n56:46.760 --> 56:50.600\nI say to fun, dude, don't fall for the tree token thing.\n\n56:50.600 --> 56:52.520\nI'm falling for it and being intrigued by it\n\n56:52.520 --> 56:53.880\nare two different things.\n\n56:53.880 --> 56:54.840\nI too am intrigued.\n\n56:54.840 --> 56:56.880\nYou're going to take my tree token?\n\n56:56.880 --> 56:58.040\nTell me more.\n\n56:58.040 --> 57:01.000\nWell, you take my tree token, and now\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:03.960\nthat you've gotten us in here, you just walk away\n\n57:03.960 --> 57:06.840\nand let us have this rat treasure for ourselves.\n\n57:06.840 --> 57:08.760\nI continue up the staircase while they're\n\n57:08.760 --> 57:10.000\nhaving this conversation.\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.200\nOh, that's the confu- it's a downward staircase.\n\n57:12.200 --> 57:14.160\nOK, then I- that's what I thought first too.\n\n57:14.160 --> 57:16.120\nI'm going back down the staircase now.\n\n57:16.120 --> 57:18.520\nI think I want to get to this crown before they do,\n\n57:18.520 --> 57:20.320\nand then I'll have the leverage.\n\n57:20.320 --> 57:26.000\nSuppose I took your token and used it to once a month\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:30.040\nby the unlimited access.\n\n57:30.040 --> 57:31.160\nWhat?\n\n57:31.160 --> 57:34.960\nAll previous adventures.\n\n57:34.960 --> 57:37.320\nWhat sorts of adventures speak- speak of?\n\n57:37.320 --> 57:39.120\nYeah, everything but Mr. Show.\n\n57:39.120 --> 57:40.640\nOh, yeah.\n\n57:40.640 --> 57:42.000\nI don't know what happened there.\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:42.480\nYeah.\n\n57:42.480 --> 57:43.280\nBecause it's HBO.\n\n57:43.280 --> 57:44.160\nAlmost comprehensive.\n\n57:44.160 --> 57:46.560\nYeah, and not community, because that's Sony.\n\n57:46.560 --> 57:47.840\nYeah, yeah.\n\n57:47.840 --> 57:50.240\nYeah, everything that NBC has ever owned.\n\n57:50.240 --> 57:51.320\nRight.\n\n57:51.320 --> 58:01.360\nNBC, Nathaniel Boulevard.\n\n58:01.360 --> 58:03.320\nWhile they do industry talk, I examine\n\n58:03.320 --> 58:05.440\nthe bottom of the staircase.\n\n58:05.440 --> 58:07.800\nOh, oh man.\n\n58:07.800 --> 58:10.680\nYou just see a circular room.\n\n58:10.680 --> 58:13.400\nIts walls are peppered in fist-sized holes.\n\n58:13.400 --> 58:17.880\nYou can hear the chittering of mice and rats.\n\n58:17.880 --> 58:23.360\nOr I have fists that stunt these holes, which\n\n58:23.360 --> 58:28.440\nare shaped fist-sized.\n\n58:28.440 --> 58:32.440\nYou've been here and punched here?\n\n58:32.440 --> 58:35.160\nIs it like me in Wisconsin?\n\n58:35.160 --> 58:36.160\nI don't know what are you saying.\n\n58:36.160 --> 58:38.120\nFor the sake of this, I run back up the stairs and go,\n\n58:38.120 --> 58:39.720\nguys, there's fist-sized holes down here.\n\n58:39.720 --> 58:41.200\nYou have a stunning fist.\n\n58:41.200 --> 58:41.720\nRight.\n\n58:41.720 --> 58:44.080\nOh, oh, oh, I thought you were, OK.\n\n58:44.080 --> 58:45.640\nI was Game of Thrones-ing it.\n\n58:45.640 --> 58:47.480\nOh, terribly.\n\n58:47.480 --> 58:50.520\nI will punch every hole.\n\n58:50.520 --> 58:53.080\nAnd I will go on the other side of the holes\n\n58:53.080 --> 58:55.400\nif there's a door that leads me to that area.\n\n58:55.400 --> 58:58.080\nAnd I won't know who's punching through those holes,\n\n58:58.080 --> 58:59.320\nbecause it won't matter.\n\n58:59.320 --> 59:02.920\nAnd that will make it hotter.\n\n59:02.920 --> 59:08.680\nAnd glory me to us in this world of holes.\n\n59:08.680 --> 59:10.360\nI'm just trying anything I can.\n\n59:10.360 --> 59:12.040\nIt all is wonderful.\n\n59:12.040 --> 59:15.520\nBy the way, did I tell you about my vow of poverty?\n\n59:15.520 --> 59:17.880\nI'm going to turn to the dwarf over here.\n\n59:17.880 --> 59:19.320\nI'm a goblin, asshole.\n\n59:19.320 --> 59:21.320\nAnd say, while they're dealing with this crap,\n\n59:21.320 --> 59:22.600\nlet's get this crown.\n\n59:22.600 --> 59:23.760\nWe shall form an alliance.\n\n59:23.760 --> 59:24.680\nWell, but don't we have to?\n\n59:24.680 --> 59:27.840\nI think we probably have to put a fist in these, like, these\n\n59:27.840 --> 59:28.320\nfist-sized holes.\n\n59:28.320 --> 59:28.360\nYeah, he did it.\n\n59:28.360 --> 59:29.160\nYeah, yeah, that's all right.\n\n59:29.160 --> 59:29.880\nI'm not my dumb joke.\n\n59:29.880 --> 59:30.760\nHe fisted the holes.\n\n59:30.760 --> 59:31.600\nI was Yankevicking.\n\n59:31.600 --> 59:32.520\nYou punched the holes.\n\n59:32.520 --> 59:33.240\nWell, let's see.\n\n59:33.240 --> 59:34.560\nWhat happened, Spencer?\n\n59:34.560 --> 59:35.920\nYou get binned by rats.\n\n59:35.920 --> 59:37.920\nOh!\n\n59:37.920 --> 59:40.800\nI was here for you, rats!\n\n59:40.800 --> 59:45.480\nThat's what happens when you draw swords on people on stairs.\n\n59:45.480 --> 59:49.600\nSo he tries every hole and doesn't work?\n\n59:49.600 --> 59:50.520\nJust the answer in there?\n\n59:50.520 --> 59:54.640\nI mean, they appear to be mouse holes.\n\n59:54.640 --> 59:55.680\nOh, they're mouse holes.\n\n59:55.680 --> 59:56.080\nYeah.\n\n59:56.080 --> 59:58.800\nOh, they're not for stunning fists, they're just for mice.\n\n59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.880\nIs there anything else in the room?\n\n01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.040\nYeah.\n\n01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.160\nWhat is it?\n\n01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.120\nOh, let me see here.\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.680\nYou see, you see what looks like a stunningly beautiful woman.\n\n01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.960\nOh!\n\n01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.840\nYou've already fisted those holes,\n\n01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.160\nbut I can now use my burning hands on the woman.\n\n01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.880\nAh!\n\n01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.920\nI blush.\n\n01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.400\nI'm the guy like, sorry about these guys.\n\n01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.720\nI just met him in a bar.\n\n01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.720\nIt's like, all right, happy hour.\n\n01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.000\nHe's using burning hands on the woman.\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.200\nYou spread your hands and shoot fire all over the room.\n\n01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:38.960\nWow.\n\n01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.920\nIt swirls around and consumes many rats\n\n01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.920\nthat are lying around on the ground.\n\n01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920\nBut not the woman, I hope.\n\n01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.320\nHe realized that that woman was never there.\n\n01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.760\nIt was just you just were so bad at looking around\n\n01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.280\nthat you thought you saw something.\n\n01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.120\nAgain!\n\n01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.960\nAlways, like usual, yes.\n\n01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.720\nNow, watch this.\n\n01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.360\nI look around.\n\n01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.920\nAll right, well, you see a very obvious door.\n\n01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.200\nNot a woman at all.\n\n01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.120\nA door that is here on demand.\n\n01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.880\nWhat?\n\n01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.600\nThat you can watch.\n\n01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.040\nI open any time you want.\n\n01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.520\nAm I trying too hard to integrate?\n\n01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.160\nDoes the door open instantly so that you can be entertained\n\n01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:26.840\nby this door?\n\n01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840\nPlease, it's curated.\n\n01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.200\nThere's the door.\n\n01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.880\nYou can do whatever you want, but by default,\n\n01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:36.360\nthe door is already flapping open and shut and you approach it.\n\n01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.720\nIs this door constructed of materials\n\n01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.480\nacross the pond as well?\n\n01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.960\nYeah, mostly, because that's the cheapest.\n\n01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.840\nIt's a not-read dwarf.\n\n01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.280\nI go up to the door, Spencer.\n\n01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.120\nI go up to the door.\n\n01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:50.920\nIt's a door.\n\n01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920\nI open the door.\n\n01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.280\nAll right.\n\n01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.960\nAnd I turn back before I open the door.\n\n01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.600\nI turn back.\n\n01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.520\nHey, remember the time you guys all thought you saw a lady\n\n01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.440\nand you tried to burn her first off?\n\n01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.560\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.640\nRemember before that, when you started to murder us?\n\n01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.840\nDidn't they draw that?\n\n01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:07.200\nYes, but we made friends.\n\n01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.360\nIt's kind of
