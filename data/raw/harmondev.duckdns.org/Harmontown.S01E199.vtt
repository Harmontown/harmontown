{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.000\nThere's a song by our friend Titanic's and Claire who always makes amazing stuff.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:13.000\nLook up Titanic online.\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:15.000\nFrom Harmontown.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:16.000\nWhere?\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:17.000\nFrom Harmontown.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:18.000\nWe're in Harmontown.\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:20.000\nIn Hollywood, California.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:22.000\nWelcome once again Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:31.000\nMusic.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:34.000\nSo many friends.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:36.000\nSpencer Crittenden everybody.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:44.000\nSpencer.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:57.000\nFrom.\n\n00:57.000 --> 00:58.000\nThat's our show. Good night.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:00.000\nThanks for coming.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:02.000\nI'm the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:07.000\nThis is Dan Harmon.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:09.000\nThank you.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:12.000\nThank you.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:14.000\nWhat a show. What a show we had.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nWhat a show.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:21.000\nWe got so much planned for you tonight.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:24.000\nBrought to you by Dr. Pepper.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:27.000\nAlright I came up with a bit. I have a bit.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:29.000\nHere comes the bit.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:33.000\nI have a real bit. Do you have a segment music for a real bit I have?\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:48.000\nMusic.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\nOkay so you know how everybody thinks professional wrestling is fake?\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:54.000\nRight.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:55.000\nOkay.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:56.000\nYes.\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:57.000\nRight.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:03.000\nI decided last night I'm already messing up the bit.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:09.000\nThat I think all other wrestling is fake.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:14.000\nBecause you can't tell me that for 6,000 years teams of people have been getting together\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nand dressing the same and trying to pin each other on a mat.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:26.000\nNobody thought to bring a snake or a 2x4.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:33.000\n14 more years of that and I'd have like a strong 10 minutes.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nThank you.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:42.000\nBut in the meantime back to the regular show which is nothing.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:49.000\nYou're like 59 minutes short of a full HBO comedy special.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.000\nIs the microphone supposed to be back further?\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nDon't you guys like it when it's back further?\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nI liked it better.\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:02.000\nNot talking to you.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:03.000\nOkay.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:08.000\nThank you for the mushrooms last night.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:15.000\nSo Dan and I and Cody we did mushrooms and we went to a fancy restaurant.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:16.000\nWhich is a terrible idea.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:18.000\nI didn't know we were going to have dinner.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:19.000\nJeff in the car.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:23.000\nWhat did you think you were going to do at the restaurant?\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:24.000\nExercise?\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nWe were going to a restaurant.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:29.000\nJeff in the car on the way to the Bel Air Hotel.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:34.000\nYou should take them now because they take an hour to kick in.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:38.000\nAnd then I think we, I don't know when we took them but exactly an hour after we took them\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:42.000\nwe were at a MatriD station.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.000\nI didn't know we were having a fancy dinner.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:52.000\nIn a restaurant where everybody was like that better be Peter Jackson.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:57.000\nBecause otherwise it's homeless hodor.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.000\nIt's the other thing.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nI was just dressed while I was wearing these clothes.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:04.000\nAnd Jeff was wearing a suit that was like when we ordered the food and then it came\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:07.000\nand it looked like Beetlejuice.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nMy appetizer was terrifying.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:14.000\nIt looked like my salad was like talking to me and it was wild.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:15.000\nAnd you don't want to eat.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:19.000\nI remember in my memory what you ordered looked like an Indian headdress.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:20.000\nYes it did.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:21.000\nExactly.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:25.000\nIt was like there were like leaves coming out of different colors.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:26.000\nWhat was that movie?\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:30.000\nThe Mayan sacrifice movie, the Mel Gibson produced one.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nApocalypse.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nMight meal look like apocalypto.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:33.000\nApocalypto.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:36.000\nHe ordered the apocalypto.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:39.000\nSorry I'll face this way too sometimes.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:40.000\nI looked over it.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nCody was laughing like crazy.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nDan look, you look really paranoid.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nI was upset.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:49.000\nAnd I just said hey you guys why don't you guys take a walk.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nI'll take care of the dinner.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:55.000\nSo I pretended like I was your like handler, like your manager.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nBecause I had a suit on.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:05.000\nAnd I said Mr. Harmon and Cody they had, they found out they had to leave.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nMay I please get their food to go for them and I'll take care of it.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:10.000\nSo I sat there.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nWe're like running around in the front.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:15.000\nI'm a seagull.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:20.000\nI walked out, I enjoyed my dinner and it was trippy because I was sitting there like when\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:26.000\nyou're on mushrooms you're a little, you're very self aware and you feel like everybody\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nelse is also kind of aware of you but maybe they're not at all.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:35.000\nBut now I'm just a dude in a suit with all like three people's food in front of me.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nAnd I made it out of there alive.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:42.000\nI had a couple drinks and I tip pretty big on your card so I'll help you like that.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:47.000\nAnd I bowed out and the Harmon is sitting out by himself at a fountain.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:52.000\nAnd he's got his left hand in the fountain.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nAnd the water's trickling on his hand.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nAnd I go over there and you were like the fountain was talking to you.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:03.000\nI laid my palm on top of the surface of the water.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:10.000\nAnd when I dipped it beneath the surface my hand became an ape's hand.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:17.000\nAnd if I lowered it it became an alien hand because apes are more sophisticated than aliens.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:23.000\nAnd the more primitive the life the more advanced it is because the more primitive the life\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:29.000\nthe more it's able to contact me because it's based on water and water is the conduit.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:37.000\nSo as I kept my palm on top, when Jeff came up I had just figured out that if I keep my palm\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:45.000\non the top of the water I can listen to all life.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nAnd do you know what it said?\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:48.000\nWhat did it say?\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nWhat did it say?\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:50.000\nWhat did all life say?\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:58.000\nIt said, tell our story.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nAnd I will.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:06.000\nLife hitched a dragon to the right star that night.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:11.000\nSee your story set in the old west with Andy Dick as the sheriff.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nSomeone pay me.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nI watched Aliens.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nThat's what I did last night.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nSteve's got cups.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nWe need those.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nThank you Steve.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:29.000\nSteve, leave everybody.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nWatch the second half of Aliens.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:33.000\nThat's a good movie.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:34.000\nIt still holds up.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:35.000\nIt's fun.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nThe first Aliens.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nOh, it don't.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:40.000\nWhat?\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:41.000\nThere was only what?\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nThe second movie in the Alien franchise.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nRight.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nAnd I watched the second half of it.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:46.000\nRight.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:47.000\nJust the second half?\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:48.000\nJust the second half.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:54.000\nMy favorite line in that movie is not Game Over Man but in that same conversation.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:59.000\nBecause Bill Pax said that she's like, she knows the way around.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:04.000\nAnd he's just like, why don't you put her in charge?\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:05.000\nI didn't do it.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nI don't know if you're keeping score.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nWhich kind of asses kicked back there?\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nAll the other ones.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:10.000\nI feel like, well, it's Bill Pax.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nIt's sort of like Bill Paxton.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nIt's great because in the sense of like, oh, Christopher Walk under Nicholson.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:19.000\nIt's like a caricature of himself.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nBut that line, why don't you put her in charge?\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:25.000\nI kind of also, I was like immediately, I was like, yeah, what the fuck is going on, man?\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nWe're going to get killed.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:28.000\nIt was good.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nIt was also like there was a tunnel to your soul.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nPaul Reiser's very good in that.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nPaul Reiser's great in him.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nThat whole movie is like Slam Dunk.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:37.000\nSlam Dunk.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nThat's a slam dunk.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nSpencer, have you ever done mushrooms?\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:42.000\nAre you a mushroom guy?\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nNah, man.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nBecause you know, here's the thing they say about mushrooms.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:46.000\nYou know what they say?\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:51.000\nThey say, if you think you're going to have a good time, you will.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:56.000\nAnd I can't think I'm going to have a good time.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:57.000\nYeah, I know what you mean.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.000\nLike, well, people freak you out by saying, it's like this weird mobius strip of like,\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:04.000\noh, if you think it's possible to have a bad trip, then you will have a bad trip.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nNo, I only think it's possible to have a bad trip.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nAnd yeah, yeah.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nI understand.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:10.000\nCompletely.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:11.000\nSame thing.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:15.000\nI just took, you know, I wanted my, I didn't want my girlfriend to think I was a pussy.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nFilthy fucking hippies.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nBut Cody had a bad time.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:23.000\nWe both kind of had overall a bad time.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:26.000\nI mean, I think it was worth it to just communicate with all of life first.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:31.000\nBut I think, I think if you like, she was saying like demons were coming out.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:34.000\nWe only took enough to have kind of a bad ecstasy trip.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nLike, it wasn't, it wasn't like, we didn't.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:40.000\nIt's like, like, I think the point of Sila Simon is supposed to be ideally that you,\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:44.000\nand they're using it to treat post traumatic stress now because another ailments because\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:49.000\nSila Simon has a clinically measurable effect of something previously thought to be immeasurable,\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nwhich is perspective.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:55.000\nLike you actually take enough of it and you, you walk away with the sense that you are\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:56.000\npart of a larger whole.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:00.000\nAnd it's sort of like, they give it to like, you know, people that were in Iraq and got,\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:04.000\ngot blown to bits and, and, and are, and are, you know, having trouble coping with that,\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nthat stress and shoving it down.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:11.000\nAnd they, they experimented with giving them Sila Simon and, and, and they're, so they're\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nfinally doing some scientific research into these effects.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:18.000\nI think if you don't take quite enough to push you through onto Jim Morrison's other side,\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:22.000\nthat you simply are just like super aware of yourself because I got out of the shower\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nand I was just like staring at myself in the mirror.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:30.000\nAnd I knew that I was disgusting, but I was also like, I was like, I'm beautiful.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:35.000\nLike, like, I was like, like Cody after like 20 minutes, he was like, baby, okay.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nAnd I said, yeah, I'm, I'm an ape.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nLike, I just know that I'm an ape.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:44.000\nAnd I was like, I was just naked and all of the, the patterns of my body hair and how\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:50.000\nthey were revealing that I had descended from an ape that had gone through a semi aquatic\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:55.000\nphase. That's right. That's why we're hairless.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nThat's, uh, uh, look it up.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:00.000\nElaine Morgan's aquatic ape theory and it was being proven to me because the scintillating\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:05.000\ndrips of water where go, following this like, you know, this like perfect like pattern.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:08.000\nAnd it was just like this, you know, everything moves when you're on mushrooms.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:13.000\nI was like, my, my, my, my big pink round gut was like pulsating like this like cocoon\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nof full of baby apes.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:20.000\nAnd it was just like, and I was just going like this and watching my belly button and\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:25.000\nmy nipples like turn into this mouth going like this, this face going like,\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nit says, it says like you had enough.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:31.000\nI had, I did, but it was all kind of up here.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:32.000\nIt was, it was all about the self.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nAnd I think that, I think that a true mushroom.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:35.000\nI told you guys to take three.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nYou only take two, right?\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nKids, if you're doing it, take more.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:45.000\nAnd tell, tell the cops I, I said it was a, all right.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:49.000\nThe first time I ever did mushrooms, I was with Jason Sudeikis and a friend of his from\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:50.000\nSecond City.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nWe were in Vegas and he was doing a show.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nDude, this story is such horseshit.\n\n11:54.000 --> 12:00.000\nI was so sick of you telling the story about you and Jason Sudeikis and his comedy friends\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nlike taking mushrooms.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nI know it's fucking not true.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:07.000\nI was in, I was in the bathroom and I heard knock, knock, knock.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nAnd then Jason Sudeikis is outside saying, hey man, you okay?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nCause we had just taken mushrooms.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nAnd I was, I was like, yeah, I'm cool.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nI'm just talking to the shampoos right now.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:19.000\nBecause the shampoos, he had a bunch of, he and his roommate, they were doing a comedy\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:23.000\nshow at the Flamingo and they were singing at a place near where Tupac got killed, I think.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:29.000\nAnd they had all these stolen hotel shampoos and they were like a little choir of angels\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nsinging to me.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nI'm like, I'm cool.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nI'm just singing with the shampoos.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nAnd Jason's like, all right, see you.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nI was trying to, I was trying to tee up like a fancy, like a, like a clever.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\nI knew what you were doing.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:40.000\nRight.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:41.000\nI knew what you were doing too.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nWho else did you do mushrooms with?\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nWill Forte?\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nWill Forte is one of the biggest fucking pussies in the world.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:48.000\nHe would never do drugs.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:49.000\nHe would never do it.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:54.000\nIf he were here and Jason Sudeikis were here, they would both fucking kick your ass or be\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:55.000\nmad.\n\n12:55.000 --> 13:23.000\nLet's bring out Jason Sudeikis and Will Forte.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nRight.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nThank you.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nHey, Will, I'm reception.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nI'm sorry about the whole pussy remark thing.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:30.000\nThat's all right.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:31.000\nOkay.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:32.000\nI feel bad about that.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nHe didn't know you were here.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:37.000\nYou look a lot tougher now, Will, with the shaved head thing.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:40.000\nYou looked much more like a, you might kick my ass for real.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nThank you very much.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nI appreciate that.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:44.000\nIt's half the battle.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.000\nJust looking like it.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:46.000\nYeah.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:47.000\nYeah.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nIs this the care?\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nAre you still shooting Last Man on Earth this season's Last Man on Earth?\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nNo, we finished a couple of months ago.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nSo we start writing on Tuesday.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nOh, okay.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nTwo more.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nSo you actually sit in the writer's room like full services, but you can't.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nAt a certain point, there's overlap, right?\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nYou can't, there's overlap.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:09.000\nSo then I, at that point, we do the acting all day, and then I got to write at nights\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nand on weekends.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nThat's not true.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nCome on.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nNo, no.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nI don't mean that to be like, you're lazy.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nLiterally acting in a scene.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nI'm acting in a scene with them.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:18.000\nAnd then it's like, okay, cut.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:19.000\nWe're going to turn around.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nI go this way because our chairs and the foods go over this way.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nWill goes this way.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:28.000\nAnd then there's a laptop open and works on the laptop the whole time.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nBecause I was like, yeah, I'll do the show.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:33.000\nIt'll be fun to hang out with you and act with you.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:36.000\nIt was like, oh, we only get to pretend to hang out.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:41.000\nI mean, we got paid, but then you left and then you went to go do his other job.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nLiterally during the day.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nThat's pretty remarkable.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.000\nI work very hard.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.000\nI'm a very hard worker.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nIt's incredible.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nHe really is.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nAre you writing?\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nAre you writing that episode?\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nAre you writing future episodes?\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nAre you freestyling?\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nHe's rewriting episodes that have already aired.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:56.000\nHe's nuts.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nHe's nuts.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nBut also different shows.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nHe's doing two, two, seven episodes.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.000\nImproving them, though.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nAll of them better.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:08.000\nJack has never been sassier.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nIs this alcohol?\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nYeah.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nWhere's that coming from?\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nOh, do you want to drink that one?\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nNo, that's all right.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:21.000\nWho's running Last Man on Earth?\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:29.000\nAndy, Bob Rowe, and Eric Durbin now is coming in to co-showrun.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nOh, okay.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nBecause Bob Rowe, you finally figured it out.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.000\nHe's a fucking...\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nHe's the worst.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nHe's not good.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:37.000\nNo, he's fantastic.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nI love him so much.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nEvery...\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nI was talking to Monica Patrick, an old community writer.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:47.000\nWe were at the hotel having brunch, and we were just...\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:50.000\nEverybody's scattered to the 85 wins now.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:53.000\nThere's a community person everywhere, because we did six seasons,\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nand I'm sure some of them are like...\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:58.000\nI'm sure they all hate me, but I'm sure also some of them...\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:02.000\nI'm nostalgic about just the family of it all.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nEach season, it's like, oh, man, season three was great.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nWe had so-and-so and such-and-such.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:10.000\nI was looking at the Yahoo season and even thinking...\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nI don't know what I'm explaining to you.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nNo, just that it's the expanse of it after it all.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:20.000\nIt's the same way at SNL, or even when I watch TV and I bore Olivia with...\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:23.000\nOh, I did Second City with that guy in that commercial.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nIt's like us, I would say, even me, you, and Jeff,\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nwe've known each other for 20-plus years, that idea of...\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nI guess that's the feeling of family,\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nwhere that's why grandparents are like,\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nit'd be nice to hear from you once in a while,\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:40.000\nbecause they're like, they only run two shows in their life\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nfor like 30 seasons each.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nIt's like a mother and a grandmother.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\n60 minutes in Japan.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nHow did you guys meet the first time then?\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nThe three of you.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nComedy Sports in Kansas City, actually.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nYeah, because Dan was Milwaukee Comedy Sports,\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nJason was Kansas City, I was LA,\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nand Rob was obviously a Milwaukee, and we met...\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nObviously.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nJust look at me.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nLook at how Milwaukee...\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nYou weren't at that tournament, I don't think.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nWere you at Kansas City?\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:05.000\nI don't think I was invited.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nThere was a Kansas City tournament.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nYou were probably invited.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:09.000\nI was probably invited.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nEveryone's allowed to go.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:11.000\nEverybody's allowed to go.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:16.000\nBut like...\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:21.000\nYou guys became an 80s mattress commercial for a second.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nSerda.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nSerda.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:24.000\nSpringer, Springer.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:25.000\nA galaxy of savings.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:26.000\nGalaxy of savings.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:29.000\nBut like, Jason, you were in a group with our friend Jeremy Carter,\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:30.000\nwho was in Super Ego.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:31.000\nYeah.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.000\nWe all...\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:36.000\nNot every city, but a lot of the cities in Comedy Sports,\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nwhen we went to a tournament,\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:42.000\nthere was kind of the younger crew that we all kind of circled\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\naround each other and became friends,\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:47.000\nand we all have remained friends, which is really crazy.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nWe all were kind of annoyed at our bosses.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nI mean, blessed all their hearts, but like...\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nRight.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nBut I remember there's always that thing.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nName names.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nJames Bailey, Clancy Hathaway, and Dick Chudnow.\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:58.000\nYeah.\n\n17:58.000 --> 17:59.000\nLike, I know all their names.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:00.000\nI remember their names.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:05.000\nTeenage Anger doesn't go away that quick.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:08.000\nI'm still making money off of it.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:12.000\nWe went all just like, talk shit about our kind of bosses.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:17.000\nWhat kind of shit?\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:18.000\nWell, they were just never...\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nThey were just never doing anything right in our minds.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.000\nYeah, the bosses.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nWe were 22, and we were like, do it.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:27.000\nWe were so funny, and like, oh, so-and-so is it, you know,\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\npaying us $20 a show doesn't give us gas money,\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nand like, doesn't he know how to run a thing?\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nAnd they didn't.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nNo, but they were great.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nWe wouldn't have all met each other.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nWe wouldn't have met the friends.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nI mean, yeah.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:38.000\nIt's tough to be the boss.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nI wouldn't have got on whose line\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nif I didn't do 10 years of short form improv.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nRight.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:43.000\nLike, that was a school for that.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\nYeah.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nBut we all eventually said, fuck this shit,\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nand like, moved on.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nYeah.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nAnd I'm not an actor,\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nbut of course as a writer and producer\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:53.000\nat ComedySports gave me all my people skills.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:59.000\nIt helps you when you're dealing with the network.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:02.000\nI would have been a real bad apple in their eyes\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:06.000\nif I hadn't learned to say yes and every fucking idiot.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:10.000\nThey still don't like me.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nBut the, well, I don't know.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:15.000\nSo let's talk about writer-actor hybrids,\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nbecause you're talking about, well, I just don't even,\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nI mean, I really want to get my head around that\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:22.000\nbecause I'm having pings of insane jealousy there\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:25.000\nwith the idea of you being on set,\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:29.000\nhaving sold a show, created it, developed it,\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:30.000\nand now you're on the set\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nand you're still running over to the laptop.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:36.000\nLike, I've got such a man crush on you for that.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:40.000\nLike, and just, because I...\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:44.000\nI told you this would be fun.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:49.000\nI didn't know that I would meet somebody.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:55.000\nIn a scene that he's describing, are you...\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:58.000\nIs what's on the laptop, like, scenes that are\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:02.000\nabout to shoot that week, or is it, like, a next episode?\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nNo, we will...\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nEvery once in a while, you'll get into a case\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:09.000\nwhere you're writing stuff for stuff that week,\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nbut usually it's jamming out the stuff\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:15.000\nthat's coming the following week.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:18.000\nI mean, ideally, you're to a place where you get this stuff\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:21.000\nall settled before you're even shooting, because...\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nIdeally, yeah.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nBut it does not happen all the time.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nEvery year, it's like the first day of school.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:29.000\nYou're like, here's my math notebook and my trapper keeper\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nand the unicorn's going to hold the pencils\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:34.000\nand here's my three shirts I'm going to wear\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nand then two days later, it's bubblegum unfolding\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nwith the thing and like...\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:43.000\nI have so many doogie-houser journals, like, either in real writing.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nThey're just, like, five strong days\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nand then I forget it and go on a trip\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:50.000\nand it's like, well, I'll never fuck that.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:53.000\nBut one that was like, it was like a little tiny one like this\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:57.000\nwas like write something for five, you know, like five years.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nI got it as a Christmas gift, so New Year's.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nAll right, great.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nLiterally, two days went on a trip and now it's done\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nand it's like I won't even pick up on it\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nbecause it's like, no, if I can't do the five years straight,\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nI'm only five months into it.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nSix months into it?\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nI'm like, no, it's dead to me.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nSorry, I blew it.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nSquandered potential.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:15.000\nWhen you got from...\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nI was with you in...\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nI was there in Las Vegas the night.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nWe happened to be in Las Vegas.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nYou were in Second City, Las Vegas.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.000\nYou had been bumped up to the minors from comedy sports\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nto like you were doing...\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nThere was like 30 people in the audience\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nin this club in Las Vegas.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:35.000\nAnd it was a funny improv show\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nbut you were kind of beaming\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:41.000\nand trying to keep your Don Draper vibe, you know,\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:44.000\nbecause you're such a hipster.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:49.000\nBut then quickly, we were told that the scout from SNL\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:52.000\nhad been there that week or maybe that day.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nOh, I don't remember. I can't.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nI don't remember the exact timeline.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nBut I mean, that's where, yeah, that's where...\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nIt was the night that it was an official, I think,\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nthat you were going to be on SNL.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nOh, wow. Yeah.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nThen that would have been...\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nHad I already auditioned for it, do you remember?\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:05.000\nI think they just came and scouted you.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nI don't know if you had auditioned.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:08.000\nThe only thing that scouted...\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nMaybe that's what it is. Maybe you got the audition.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nIt was a manager.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:14.000\nIt was a manager that saw myself and K Cannon\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nwho I was in the cast with\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nand then a guy named Seamus McCarthy\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nand that manager picked us all up\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nand then we made...\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:21.000\nThe guys made tapes\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nbecause they were looking for guys, I think,\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:24.000\nor at least I made a tape.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nAnd I just filmed the show, basically,\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nand then sent it in.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:30.000\nAnd so I knew maybe I was going to get to go audition.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:31.000\nI would assume maybe at that point.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:34.000\nBut they offered you a deal, as I recall,\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nthat had been...\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nThere was a template for it in the past.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nIt was like, you know...\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:39.000\nGetting hired as a writer.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:40.000\nYeah.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:42.000\nSo I went to go audition for the show\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nand then didn't get it,\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nbut they liked me\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nand then I got...\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nA week later, they were like,\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nhey, why don't you come out again?\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nAnd this is when you meet Lauren Michaels\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nand he's just making sure you're not crazy\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nor I think he just said\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:56.000\nhe wants to make sure you're someone\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nthat if you walk by in the hallway at 2 a.m.,\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nhe wouldn't be scared or worried.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:01.000\nIt makes sense.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nIt's his gig.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nWhat do you think started that rule?\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nYeah.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:09.000\nLike, who do you think made that happen?\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nEither someone or else it was a part of him\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nthat he didn't want to do it.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nI mean, you know...\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nIt was Tim Meadow.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nIt was Tim Meadow.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:20.000\nHe's just a loose cannon.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nI'm just going to say loose gun,\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:25.000\nhot cannon, none of my jokes.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nBut we...\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nYeah.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.000\nSo then you go out there\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nand then I got hired as a writer,\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:30.000\nwhich I was a little bit like,\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:31.000\noh, it's a...\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nIt was like, oh, nuts.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nWhich is ridiculous.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nBut I didn't send in a packet.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nI had an imposter syndrome,\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:41.000\nall that stuff once getting it.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nAnd then you just kind of like\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:46.000\njust say yes and then hope to God it all works out.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:47.000\nAnd it paid off.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:48.000\nYou kind of knew that.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:49.000\nThey were kind of grooming you a bit\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nfor being on the cast, right?\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:52.000\nYeah, and that was what you were talking about.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nAt that point, there was like...\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nThere was like Tina had done it\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nand David Spade had done it\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\nand Sandler had done it\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nand like even back in the day,\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nChevy did it kind of, you know,\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nto a degree.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\nWho else?\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.000\nThere's like everybody...\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:04.000\nRobert Schneider?\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:05.000\nYeah, everybody that had done it in the past,\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:08.000\nyou know, that been a writer\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nand was a cast member\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nhad all made that...\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nYou sort of knew who they were.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nWell, they never tell you about Gourby Phillips.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:15.000\nYeah, never, yeah.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.000\nGourby doesn't get his love.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nHe's the guy who wanted to be an actor.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:19.000\nThey gave him a job as a writer\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nand he's still there.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:21.000\nOh.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nHis office is in the basement.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nHorrible writer, hilarious in the room.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:26.000\nYeah.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:27.000\nHilarious in the room.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:28.000\nYou love him in the room.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:29.000\nYou love him in there.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nIt just keeps people laughing.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nI remember Jason, like after the first season\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nor two of you and the cast,\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nyou would come back to LA\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:37.000\nand we'd go have a drink\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nand you would just sit down\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nand just dump like how difficult\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:42.000\nthat job was.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nIt seemed like it was like...\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:45.000\nBut always making sure\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nhe was very thankful\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nand said everyone was very wonderful.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nJeff, it's like Israel over there.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nBy design.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nBy design.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nBy design.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:55.000\nYou know.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nBut also like our friend,\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:57.000\nlike Andy Samber,\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:58.000\nlike every time I saw him\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nhe seemed to have aged about 10 years.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:01.000\nOh, it's like the presidency in that way.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nYeah, it's like...\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nUntil you sort of like develop\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nlike a niche, I think,\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:08.000\nor I would like,\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nwith this guy to my left,\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nlike such an original sort of voice\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:13.000\nthat Lauren's like,\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\noh, this is a variety show.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nI need to have what Will does on there\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:17.000\nor like the Lonely Island, guys.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nI need to have the Lonely Island.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nThat generation, you know, like Kristen.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:21.000\nI need to have a...\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nI need to have a Kristen track\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\non those greatest hits.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nRight.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nIt's like...\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nI talked to somebody about\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:27.000\nhow Lauren has always been...\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nThat's always been his real secret\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nunderneath it all.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nI think because it was back\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nwhen Channel 101 was starting\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nto be a thing\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:34.000\nand the Lonely Island guys\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:35.000\nwere doing Channel 101\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:36.000\nand then all of a sudden,\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:37.000\noh my god, they're taking\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:38.000\nthat different path,\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nthat Schiller reel...\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.000\nRight.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:44.000\nMr. Bill path to SNL,\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:45.000\nwhich is a...\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:46.000\nAnd somebody was talking to me\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:47.000\nabout it and they said,\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\noh no, but Lauren's a genius\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nlike about that in particular\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nthat he always recognized\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nthat, you know,\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:58.000\nthe potential obsolescence\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nof what he was doing there\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nand how any one of these random\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nasteroids or geniuses\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nthat, you know,\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:09.000\nhe had this way of like...\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:10.000\nHe would beckon you in and say,\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:11.000\nlook, I know what you want\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nand I know what you deserve\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:14.000\nand I'm going to set you up\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:15.000\nso that you can have it.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nSo the Lonely Island\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nwere getting their card\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nthat said it's an SNL digital short.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nThat's their property.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nHe knew that about Smigol.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:26.000\nHe understood that you can't\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\ncreate an army of generals.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nYou have to like give them...\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nYou have to let them have the illusion\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:33.000\nthat they have their own world.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:34.000\nYeah.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:35.000\nNo, it's true.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nI would say that he is good at that.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:38.000\nYou have to earn that though.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:39.000\nHow far into...\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nWill and Jason, like how far,\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nlike along when you were a cast member,\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nwas it when you found like,\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:46.000\nokay, this is my niche.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nThis is my thing.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nDid that take a while or...\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nBecause I remember like at one point,\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nyou guys were just my favorite.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\nLike that cast was really good.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:56.000\nAnd you two together especially\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nbecause I went to one of the tapings\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nand you guys doing that\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nyour mustached ESPN3\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nkind of character was hilarious.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nBut like, did it take a while\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nto find your stride and find like,\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nokay, this is my shit.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nThis is what I do.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nI mean, it depends for everybody\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:18.000\nbecause I would always kind of do\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nweirder stuff and it's hard\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:23.000\nto get that stuff on.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:26.000\nSo you have to kind of build up this trust\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nand I was...\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nIt would kill on Wednesday as PS.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nLike the read through, it was like,\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:33.000\nevery time like you see,\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nbecause at the top of every script,\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nit's the writer's names.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:37.000\nSo like you'd see like, you know,\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:38.000\nFaye and Polar.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:39.000\nOr like if it said Forte,\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nyou're just kind of like,\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:42.000\neven if you've been there five hours,\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:45.000\nyou're like, oh, here we go.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nI mean, it's the truth, it's the truth.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nAnd especially when you were writing\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nwith Sloven and Allen,\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nlike there was this ironing,\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nsharpening iron thing that was brewing there\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nthat I don't think really kicked in\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:57.000\nto Jeff's question.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nLike until maybe our group came in\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nbecause I felt like just watching it\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:04.000\noutside, your stuff started to get that play.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nLike after you stopped playing Bush, really.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:07.000\nOh, for sure.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nI was, you know, I...\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:13.000\nIt was an honor to play Bush,\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nbut it was an honor I did not want.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nIt was, you know...\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:18.000\nBecause then I ended up playing it.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nYou know, Will Ferrell had just done it.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nI know.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:22.000\nIt's like, what are we doing?\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:23.000\nIt was, you know, to me,\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nit's like Dana Carvey doing The Church Lady.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:26.000\nYeah.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:27.000\nLike Bush...\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nWill Ferrell had turned Bush\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:32.000\ninto a character that was so...\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.000\nFlat out one in the election.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:34.000\nOne in the election.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nRuined our country for eight years\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nby his talent, his charm.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nYou can't have, you know,\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:40.000\nDana Carvey would not leave\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nand then somebody else come in\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nand do The Church Lady, so...\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nBut you have to do The President.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:45.000\nRight.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nSo I, you know, somehow became that guy,\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.000\nand I was shitty at it.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:49.000\nThat's not true.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.000\nAt the beginning, you know,\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:51.000\nwhen he was all whiny,\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:52.000\nlike you were great at it,\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:53.000\nbecause you were like,\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:54.000\nah, man, and he was like...\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\nWell, I...\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:56.000\nAnd then he changed.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nIt certainly was not the kind of stuff\n\n28:58.000 --> 28:59.000\nI liked to do.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:00.000\nAnd, you know, I was...\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nIt was a fun adventure,\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nbut, like, that...\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nThe cast was so big at the time\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nthat, like, a lot of times I would\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nbe putting out the kind of stuff\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\nthat I liked.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:11.000\nRight.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:12.000\nBut, you know,\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\nyou got to service everybody,\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:14.000\nso I would get these...\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:15.000\nYou got your sketch in five minutes.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:16.000\nBush things that were in there\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nthat weren't necessarily my thing,\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nand that would be the thing\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:21.000\nfor that episode.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nSo, like, for a couple years,\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:24.000\nI was just kind of the Bush guy\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nand didn't really get to do...\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:27.000\nBut there was also this...\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.000\nI remember who told me about this,\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nbut then I started looking for it,\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:30.000\nthat in those years,\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nthere was closer to midnight.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nIt was like, okay, these...\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nLike, I always tried to figure out\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nthe formula with the last sketch on SNL.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nIt was like, sometimes it was clearly\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\njust the shittiest.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:45.000\nSometimes it was one that, like...\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:46.000\nI have no idea.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:47.000\nYou guys could tell me,\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:48.000\nand maybe for political reasons,\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:49.000\nyou wouldn't even be able to,\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nor it would take too long,\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:52.000\nor there is no formula,\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:53.000\nbut then somebody told me, like,\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:54.000\nwatch the...\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:55.000\nBut sometimes it's like,\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\nthese, like, weird pieces\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nof esoteric brilliance,\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:03.000\nthese, like, just good quality sketches\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nthat were...\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nAnd it was Forte's name\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nthat was, like, attached to that.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nIt was like, oh, that's a...\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nYou got to watch till midnight,\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:14.000\nbecause there might be a Forte sketch coming,\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:15.000\nbecause they're putting them there,\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nnot because they don't believe in them,\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nbut because, like, the spelling of the sketch.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nLike, a hidden trap.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nThat was what I was going to say\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:24.000\nwas the episode\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nthat where I felt like it all kicked in.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nThat was Jack Black hosting\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nthe Christmas episode\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nof what happened to be,\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:32.000\noddly enough,\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:33.000\nmy generation's first season.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:34.000\nI was lucky to be there two years.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nI was there.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:36.000\nYou were there.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:37.000\nSo you had...\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.000\nYou had Jack Black kicking ass\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nhis second time hosting,\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nsinging an amazing King Kong opener.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nThen you have...\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:44.000\nThen you have...\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:45.000\nThere was the...\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nWith Wigan and I,\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:47.000\nthe first A-holes,\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:48.000\ntwo A-holes buying a Christmas tree.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nYou had Christmas time for the Jews,\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\na short thing of...\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nAmazing short film parody\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:55.000\nby Smigel.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nYou had Spelling Bee\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nwith Forte.\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nAnd then most importantly,\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nI would say,\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:01.000\nmost iconically lazy Sunday\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nby Lonely Island.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:04.000\nAnd that was just like...\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.000\nIt was all one episode.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:06.000\nIt gives me goosebumps.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:07.000\nWhat was that one season?\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:08.000\nOne episode.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.000\nThat was the Christmas episode\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:10.000\nof 2005.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:11.000\nSo that must be why\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:12.000\nI was watching it,\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\nbecause, like, my friends were like,\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:14.000\nlike, oh, my God,\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:15.000\nthey had just gone up.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:16.000\nI was at the party\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.000\nwhere Bill Hader was also...\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:18.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:19.000\nAlongside them\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:20.000\nwas, like, being sent up\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:21.000\nin a balloon to New York.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:23.000\nGoodbye, guys.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:24.000\nSorry.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nAnd so I must have been watching\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nthat night going,\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\noh, this is the first,\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nor maybe it was just because\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:29.000\nit was a lazy Sunday thing,\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:30.000\nbecause they had done stuff\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nbefore that,\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nand the lazy Sunday\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:33.000\nwas kind of their whatever.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:34.000\nBut the Spelling Bee thing,\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:35.000\nI just want to talk about\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:36.000\nfor a second,\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:37.000\nthe sketch,\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:38.000\nthe Spelling Bee sketch,\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:39.000\nI'm sure if you just type\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nit into YouTube,\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:41.000\nwho knows,\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nor if it's something,\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nyou just find it.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:44.000\nIt simply judges\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nat a Spelling Bee saying,\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:47.000\nall right,\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:48.000\nyour next word is...\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:49.000\nWhat's the next word?\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:50.000\nBusiness.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:51.000\nBusiness.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nAnd then the entire sketch\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.000\nfrom front to back\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nis Will Forte\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:59.000\nincorrectly spelling business.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nAnd that's it.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nThat's the whole sketch.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nHe doesn't finish, like,\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:05.000\nyou know,\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:06.000\nand then they go,\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:07.000\noh, that's not quite right.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:08.000\nWhy don't you try a simpler word,\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nlike cat,\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.000\nand then he does it three times,\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.000\nand then in the end,\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nhe spells a really complicated word\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:13.000\nreally well,\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:14.000\nand then you're done.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.000\nThe entire sketch\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:16.000\nis him failing\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:17.000\nto spell the word business.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:18.000\nAnd it's not a short sketch.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:21.000\nIt's Conehead's size.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nIt's a proper size,\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:24.000\na Hungry Man,\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:25.000\nJack's sketch size,\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:26.000\nbut the whole meal\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.000\nis just different letters.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nQ, Q, Q.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:32.000\nHow many times do you say Q?\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:33.000\nQ.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.000\nWould you do numbers\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.000\nat one point,\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nlike adding numbers\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\ninto it?\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:41.000\nThat was a hard one to get on,\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:42.000\nbecause I had done it\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:43.000\nat the groundlings\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\na bunch of times.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:46.000\nKilling it.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.000\nKilling it at the groundlings.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:48.000\nThis would go very well\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:49.000\nat the groundlings.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:50.000\nYou did it at SNL.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:51.000\nIt wouldn't get picked.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:52.000\nYou would do it at,\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:53.000\nlike Smigel would have you\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:54.000\ndo nine of too many stars.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:55.000\nYou'd play like Radio City\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:56.000\nMusic Hall and do it.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:57.000\nIt would crush,\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:58.000\nand then they would put it\n\n32:58.000 --> 32:59.000\nat the table,\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:00.000\nor wherever you guys were\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:01.000\ndoing those,\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:02.000\nwhere he would ask you to do\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:03.000\nit at a benefit.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nIt would crush,\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:05.000\nand he'd bring it back\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:06.000\nto like, you know,\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:07.000\n17th floor,\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:08.000\nlike, you know,\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\n50 people watching.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:10.000\nEverybody's just like,\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:11.000\nit's killing,\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:12.000\nbut everybody's like,\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:13.000\nit's never going to get on.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:14.000\nAnd it wasn't...\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:15.000\nWell, I got a handle,\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:16.000\nlike Jack Black was the one\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:17.000\ngoing forward,\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:18.000\nbecause he, you know,\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:19.000\nhe is great,\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nand he's such a champion of\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\ncomedy,\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nand just really like it.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:24.000\nYou got to put it before it did.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:25.000\nIf it wasn't for him,\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nyeah,\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:27.000\nif it wasn't for him,\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.000\nit wouldn't have gotten on.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:29.000\nWhat was that like?\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:30.000\nSame with A-holes.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:31.000\nWhen you wrote a really\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:32.000\nweird sketch\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:33.000\nthat was kind of esoteric\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:34.000\nand strange,\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:35.000\nand you go into that\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:36.000\nread-through,\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:37.000\nwhere everybody's,\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:38.000\nyou know,\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:39.000\nyou've got the piles of paper,\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nall the scripts,\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\nyou're reading through\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\neverything,\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:43.000\nyou have to get up\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:44.000\nand really perform that,\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:45.000\nlike at the table.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:46.000\nAnd you get all that\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:47.000\nto the room, right?\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:49.000\nI mean,\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:50.000\nmost of the time,\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.000\nyou're just sitting down.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:52.000\nEvery once in a while,\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:53.000\nif there's something\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:54.000\nwith a little more action,\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:55.000\nyou might stand up\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:56.000\nand do some of this stuff.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:57.000\nBut, you know,\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:58.000\nyou do it pretty full-out.\n\n33:58.000 --> 33:59.000\nYou're something\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nthat maybe no one thinks to...\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nWhat does the writer's room\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:02.000\nlook like?\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:03.000\nWhen you're at SNL,\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:04.000\nand it's like...\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:05.000\nIt's like an office,\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:06.000\nit's like a conference room,\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:07.000\nlike a vibe.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:08.000\nIt's like,\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:09.000\nit's almost like\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:10.000\nthe comments.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:11.000\nIt's a big table,\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.000\neveryone's sitting around it.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nBut then it's on the outer walls,\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:14.000\neverybody's sitting around it.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:15.000\nAnd depending on\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:16.000\nhow many there are,\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:17.000\nlike right now,\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:18.000\nthere's probably not much elbow room.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:19.000\nIt got to a point\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:20.000\nwhen we were there\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:21.000\nthat there was like a nice amount of room.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:22.000\nSo the cast is around the table,\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:23.000\nand then there's a search.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:24.000\nAt the head of the table\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nis Lorne and the host.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:27.000\nAnd then cast, cast, cast,\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:28.000\ncast, cast, cast, cast,\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:29.000\nthen around this side,\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:30.000\nlike if you were looking down\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:31.000\nat three o'clock is,\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:32.000\nlike Seth,\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nand one of the assistant\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:35.000\ndirectors, Jeanine,\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:36.000\nwho times every sketch.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:37.000\nOne of the producers,\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:38.000\nSteve Higgins,\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nsomebody else.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:41.000\nBut then around the sides\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nare like the department heads.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:44.000\nAll the writers\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:45.000\nare like at nine o'clock\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:46.000\nbehind here,\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:47.000\nlike four rows deep.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:48.000\nPeople are sometimes sleeping\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:49.000\nbecause they've been up\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:50.000\nsince 10 a.m.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:51.000\nOh, okay.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.000\nSo this is a room\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:53.000\nwhere there's a table.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:54.000\nYou're describing,\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nthis is a table read.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:57.000\nTable read.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nYes.\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nWhat does the,\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nlike what about just\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:03.000\nthe room in which\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\npeople are pitching sketches?\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nIt mostly happens in offices.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:08.000\nYeah.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:09.000\nIt's like a normal\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:10.000\noffice building\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nwith just a more open\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nfart policy.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:14.000\nIt looks like 30 rock.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:15.000\nI mean, it looks like,\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:16.000\nthat's, I mean, you know,\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nlike the TV show.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nBut when you're a writer,\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nare you sitting,\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:22.000\nlike,\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:23.000\nlike when you think,\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:24.000\nare you sitting\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:25.000\ncross-legged on a carpeted floor\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:26.000\nwith a,\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:27.000\nwith a sheaf of papers\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:28.000\nin front of you,\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nnotes scribbled on them,\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:30.000\nwaiting your turn\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:31.000\nto pitch something?\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:32.000\nYes.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:33.000\nOn Mondays with the host,\n\n35:33.000

office.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:38.000\nSome people on chairs,\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:39.000\nlike humans,\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:40.000\nother people on the ground.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:41.000\nHave you

like, oh fuck this old man, he has no idea, but I come back.\n\n43:14.800 --> 43:16.560\nAnd the more I thought about it, he was absolutely right.\n\n43:16.560 --> 43:21.240\nI was just like, I would be too nervous about performing in other people's things.\n\n43:21.240 --> 43:25.800\nAnd so once I, he just, you know, he gave me the best advice of all time, which was\n\n43:25.800 --> 43:31.240\njust to go in there and make the characters your own in other people's things.\n\n43:31.240 --> 43:32.720\nAnd we'll just let her rip.\n\n43:32.720 --> 43:33.720\nYeah.\n\n43:33.720 --> 43:34.720\nExactly.\n\n43:34.720 --> 43:38.480\nAnd thank God he let me come back and that really was like, you know, knowing that I had\n\n43:38.480 --> 43:42.480\nalmost been fired, it all felt like gravy and then it was just like, okay, fuck it.\n\n43:42.480 --> 43:47.120\nHe's like, look, if these writers knew better than actors, they'd be actors.\n\n43:47.120 --> 43:51.760\nLike they, they're so smart, but they can't act like you could come in and take their\n\n43:51.760 --> 43:55.880\nstuff and take it to the, take it to the end zone where, yeah, and your experience had\n\n43:55.880 --> 43:56.880\nbeen as a writer.\n\n43:56.880 --> 44:02.240\nI would sometimes get their stuff down to like the 25.\n\n44:02.240 --> 44:04.600\nBut suds, you're probably a little more complicated, right?\n\n44:04.600 --> 44:08.320\nBecause you're not quite as, I mean, he was a writer forever and you're like, you're,\n\n44:08.320 --> 44:10.880\nyou're an improviser, which is half and half already.\n\n44:10.880 --> 44:12.400\nYou're like a golden doodle.\n\n44:12.400 --> 44:13.400\nRight.\n\n44:13.400 --> 44:18.280\nBut you're, you're also, we call Jason suds.\n\n44:18.280 --> 44:19.280\nYeah.\n\n44:19.280 --> 44:20.280\nYes.\n\n44:20.280 --> 44:21.280\nAll right.\n\n44:21.280 --> 44:27.000\nBut your passion was for performing originally, I mean, and so, and then they're saying to\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.160\nyou, well, yeah, but you're a writer, right?\n\n44:29.160 --> 44:30.320\nAnd then they're putting you in the writers group.\n\n44:30.320 --> 44:35.880\nSo when you're out, when you're in front of a camera or on a pink and seafoam poster\n\n44:35.880 --> 44:41.640\nwith three starlets and then your face, part of my face, they put, they added some stuff\n\n44:41.640 --> 44:42.640\nto my face.\n\n44:42.640 --> 44:43.640\nEyebrows.\n\n44:43.640 --> 44:44.640\nYeah.\n\n44:44.640 --> 44:45.640\nBut I know what you mean.\n\n44:45.640 --> 44:47.920\nWhen you're, when you're, when you're studding it up in front of the unblinking eye over\n\n44:47.920 --> 44:51.840\nthe shoulder, your beard, your beard and the mother's day poster is really great.\n\n44:51.840 --> 44:52.840\nYeah.\n\n44:52.840 --> 44:53.840\nIt's really, yeah.\n\n44:53.840 --> 44:55.560\nLike, it's like Drake density.\n\n44:55.560 --> 45:00.320\nIt's like, it's like, it's a healthy, healthy, but my eyebrows, like when I look at, I go,\n\n45:00.320 --> 45:05.280\nI wish I told you knows where I'd be if I look like that.\n\n45:05.280 --> 45:07.400\nIt's like a little kid's hobo costume.\n\n45:07.400 --> 45:09.440\nThey're stippling involved.\n\n45:09.440 --> 45:13.640\nI texted Jason, like a picture of that poster, I said, please, I don't know what this movie\n\n45:13.640 --> 45:16.800\nis about, but please tell me that you're a high-priced male hustler.\n\n45:16.800 --> 45:17.800\nYeah.\n\n45:17.800 --> 45:24.960\nAnd your, your eyebrows have their own beards, like it's, it's, you're, you're, you're made\n\n45:24.960 --> 45:25.960\nof beards in that.\n\n45:25.960 --> 45:26.960\nIt's amazing.\n\n45:26.960 --> 45:27.960\nYeah.\n\n45:27.960 --> 45:28.960\nYeah.\n\n45:28.960 --> 45:30.960\nNo, it's, it's, I am, I'm with you when I saw it, I was just like, yeah, I mean, it was,\n\n45:30.960 --> 45:31.960\nyou know, whatever.\n\n45:31.960 --> 45:32.960\nThat's so great.\n\n45:32.960 --> 45:39.360\nSo are, so are you an actor that has used your extra ability to write to, to, to, I\n\n45:39.360 --> 45:40.360\nthink so.\n\n45:40.360 --> 45:41.360\nI would say, I would say so.\n\n45:41.360 --> 45:42.360\nI, I, I do.\n\n45:42.360 --> 45:46.400\nI mean, I, I, there's, there's such a, for me, like with acting, like nobody cares, but\n\n45:46.400 --> 45:50.640\nlike, since you're sort of asking about it, like, of like the left brain, right brain,\n\n45:50.640 --> 45:55.160\nlike I think I'm, I'm envious of, of actors that can really just like, just like be in\n\n45:55.160 --> 45:56.160\nit.\n\n45:56.160 --> 45:59.160\nI feel like I can get there because, but my left brain's always working.\n\n45:59.160 --> 46:02.080\nThe part of you that has to hit a mark, the part of you that has to like know where the\n\n46:02.080 --> 46:05.280\nlight is and all that kind of stuff, especially like tracking shots, all that stuff, I can\n\n46:05.280 --> 46:06.280\nhandle really well.\n\n46:06.280 --> 46:10.280\nAnd I think that comes from like playing basketball as a kid, like running plays and stuff, like\n\n46:10.280 --> 46:11.280\nit's like,\n\n46:11.280 --> 46:13.640\nSo sports, sports come back around to haunt me.\n\n46:13.640 --> 46:17.920\nBut I think it could have happened with like any, any sort of group mentality.\n\n46:17.920 --> 46:22.160\nI just didn't have like, you know, the group of kids that in my neighborhood, they played\n\n46:22.160 --> 46:24.000\nsports, they didn't put on plays.\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:25.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.440\nI don't mean as a smart ass cause I know there are neighborhoods like that and I was lucky\n\n46:27.440 --> 46:29.720\nto meet those kind of kids in high school.\n\n46:29.720 --> 46:35.400\nBut like it, so I'm like always cognizant of like what's, what is needed to happen to\n\n46:35.400 --> 46:42.320\nmake it like, like at least not have to cut because of some mal, like physical malfunction.\n\n46:42.320 --> 46:43.320\nYou know what I mean?\n\n46:43.320 --> 46:44.320\nThat brings up an interesting question.\n\n46:44.320 --> 46:49.640\nForte, do you, you're writing for yourself and that means to a powerful degree, you're\n\n46:49.640 --> 46:53.680\nblocking yourself like, like a director could come in and say, no, I think you should be\n\n46:53.680 --> 46:54.680\nin the doorway.\n\n46:54.680 --> 46:55.680\nSorry, I burped.\n\n46:55.680 --> 46:56.680\nIt's gross.\n\n46:56.680 --> 46:58.400\nYou, you, I think you should be in the doorway and then you should, you should do a somersault\n\n46:58.400 --> 47:02.360\nand sometimes directors have great ideas and sometimes they're just directors that the,\n\n47:02.360 --> 47:11.480\nthe, the, you, you first and foremost, if you're writing a scene.\n\n47:11.480 --> 47:14.480\nIt's how you respond to that sentence that says more about anything.\n\n47:14.480 --> 47:15.480\nYou know what I mean?\n\n47:15.480 --> 47:20.000\nI'm sure it was very visual, whatever's going on down there, but it doesn't tell a story\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:23.240\nat the end of the day and Rob's mind, we need both.\n\n47:23.240 --> 47:24.240\nWe need both.\n\n47:24.240 --> 47:27.480\nRob is drawing a storyboard of him killing you right now.\n\n47:27.480 --> 47:34.480\nNo, but, so, I'm doing a bird's eye of taking a shit on his car.\n\n47:34.480 --> 47:35.480\nDo you?\n\n47:35.480 --> 47:36.480\nOkay.\n\n47:36.480 --> 47:37.480\nI wish directors did bird's eyes.\n\n47:37.480 --> 47:42.480\nYou're doing a shot list of being in your drink.\n\n47:42.480 --> 47:48.240\nYou're, you sit, you, you, you, you, you have a specific brain.\n\n47:48.240 --> 47:53.000\nI mean, you're like, like, like, are you, so you're, here you're this guy that's going\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:56.560\nlike, you're kind of like, oh, I want this joke to land, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n47:56.560 --> 47:59.520\nI won't repeat the process that you took us through, but then you're in a laptop.\n\n47:59.520 --> 48:04.240\nSo you're writing that a character is going to be played by you and you, I guess the\n\n48:04.240 --> 48:09.360\nsmall part of my question is like, do you do things like mitigate your, your blocking\n\n48:09.360 --> 48:10.360\nin the scene?\n\n48:10.360 --> 48:12.960\nDo you go like, look, I don't want to do a bunch of complicated shit in this scene because\n\n48:12.960 --> 48:17.720\nI'm going to start, I'm only going to be funny if I'm able to sit still and like remember\n\n48:17.720 --> 48:22.560\nmy lines or, or, or are you like, no, I need to occupy myself, anything like that.\n\n48:22.560 --> 48:27.480\nLike, do you, do you, knowing yourself as a performer, when you're writing, do you write\n\n48:27.480 --> 48:28.480\nspecific things for yourself?\n\n48:28.480 --> 48:32.440\nWell, certainly you will write to your strengths, but, but every once in a while there will\n\n48:32.440 --> 48:37.360\nbe things that bring you outside your comfort zone if, if you get together, together with\n\n48:37.360 --> 48:41.560\nthe writers and they all think it's a great idea and you think, all right, let's fucking\n\n48:41.560 --> 48:42.560\ngo for it.\n\n48:42.560 --> 48:47.120\nYou know, it's, it, it really is a, but for the most part you can, you can really, you'll\n\n48:47.120 --> 48:52.720\nknow the stuff you're good at, not very good at, and you kind of stick with the stuff you're\n\n48:52.720 --> 48:53.720\ngood at.\n\n48:53.720 --> 48:57.600\nI think all that stuff literally comes down to like trust of, of, you know, like literally\n\n48:57.600 --> 49:01.240\nlike where I'm going to be, I'll ask, I'll be asked to do this.\n\n49:01.240 --> 49:04.560\nLike me staying in my head, I don't think it's necessarily healthy, like all the time\n\n49:04.560 --> 49:08.800\nas, as even though I feel connected more as a actor than a writer, the part of me that\n\n49:08.800 --> 49:13.480\ndoesn't let me get out of my head is probably not giving the person directing me the majority\n\n49:13.480 --> 49:17.480\nof the time enough trust to just be out of my own head, to maybe have an assessment of\n\n49:17.480 --> 49:18.480\nit.\n\n49:18.480 --> 49:19.840\nBut I don't in the middle of, of a scene.\n\n49:19.840 --> 49:23.400\nIt's only like when looking at the sides or thinking about it, if they suggest something,\n\n49:23.400 --> 49:24.960\nI'll be like, oh no.\n\n49:24.960 --> 49:28.120\nSo I think like with stuff, you would have stuff in your head in scenes that we would\n\n49:28.120 --> 49:31.840\ndo and then we would sort of talk about stuff and maybe you would feel, you're always very\n\n49:31.840 --> 49:32.840\naccommodating.\n\n49:32.840 --> 49:35.640\nIt's not like you're rigid and like, I wrote it this way, so it has to be this way.\n\n49:35.640 --> 49:36.640\nOh yeah.\n\n49:36.640 --> 49:41.200\nAnd if, and if, and if there's ever a director that wants to try something that's different\n\n49:41.200 --> 49:46.640\nthan what I was thinking, it's always somebody like Jason Wallner who knows his shit and\n\n49:46.640 --> 49:51.400\nJohn Solomon are, you know, best buddy and, and, you know, these, these wonderful people\n\n49:51.400 --> 49:56.640\nwho are super smart and, and, you know, got the bone to Rob Schrab for, you know, just\n\n49:56.640 --> 49:57.640\nfor.\n\n49:57.640 --> 49:58.640\nYeah, get them in there.\n\n49:58.640 --> 49:59.640\nI'm sure.\n\n49:59.640 --> 50:00.640\nSchrab, Schrab, I'm sure is great.\n\n50:00.640 --> 50:01.640\nYeah.\n\n50:01.640 --> 50:02.640\nYeah.\n\n50:02.640 --> 50:03.640\nLike, yeah.\n\n50:03.640 --> 50:04.640\nThank you.\n\n50:04.640 --> 50:05.640\nYeah.\n\n50:05.640 --> 50:10.680\nNo, I've always, I've never, well, I've, well, I've had what you've had, which is like\n\n50:10.680 --> 50:14.080\nyou write something, you hear it a certain way in your head, and it would be great if\n\n50:14.080 --> 50:15.960\nthey did it exactly that way.\n\n50:15.960 --> 50:19.760\nSometimes it's right in the bubble where you're trying to figure out, do I just want to hear\n\n50:19.760 --> 50:21.080\nthis the way it was in my head?\n\n50:21.080 --> 50:26.280\nAm I objectively hearing it like, so I can decide actually, oh, that's, that's fine.\n\n50:26.280 --> 50:27.280\nNo.\n\n50:27.280 --> 50:32.040\nUh, then there's the, then there's the getting past that there's the, oh, someone, please\n\n50:32.040 --> 50:33.040\nhelp me with this.\n\n50:33.040 --> 50:37.760\nAnd if a director can think of a better blocking and sometimes, you know, um, like, like, like\n\n50:37.760 --> 50:42.520\nHeath Cullen's on, on Great Minds will like, like, like, I'll have a very basic thing in\n\n50:42.520 --> 50:46.600\nmy head and then he'll go, yeah, but what if, what if the person was sitting behind the\n\n50:46.600 --> 50:49.600\ndoorway and then you entered, so then we could all get it in one shot.\n\n50:49.600 --> 50:54.360\nThere's always different shaped brains and they all overlap and, um, I'm sure Rob's great\n\n50:54.360 --> 50:55.360\nat something.\n\n50:55.360 --> 51:05.720\nThe, um, the, uh, I told you he wouldn't have fun.\n\n51:05.720 --> 51:12.040\nI just remembered something that, uh, so we finished, I think I need a table next time.\n\n51:12.040 --> 51:13.040\nNext time I'm on the show.\n\n51:13.040 --> 51:14.040\nOh yeah.\n\n51:14.040 --> 51:17.120\nWhat are you going to do with that table?\n\n51:17.120 --> 51:19.280\nNothing I guess.\n\n51:19.280 --> 51:24.320\nMaybe you could use it to, uh, distant or a fuck.\n\n51:24.320 --> 51:32.280\nMaybe you can use it to stutter and emotionally distance yourself from the people on stage.\n\n51:32.280 --> 51:33.280\nIt is so weird.\n\n51:33.280 --> 51:35.880\nI mean, he brings Spencer out first and he sits in the corner and we never talked from\n\n51:35.880 --> 51:36.880\nfirst.\n\n51:36.880 --> 51:37.880\nYeah.\n\n51:37.880 --> 51:38.880\nOh, I mean.\n\n51:38.880 --> 51:39.880\nAnd now you're bringing me out.\n\n51:39.880 --> 51:40.880\nYeah.\n\n51:40.880 --> 51:41.880\nNo, yeah.\n\n51:41.880 --> 51:44.120\nI was slowly going to fill the stage full of people who don't talk.\n\n51:44.120 --> 51:45.120\nNo.\n\n51:45.120 --> 51:46.120\nWell, it's our fault.\n\n51:46.120 --> 51:48.880\nYou guys were all kicking in before we got out here.\n\n51:48.880 --> 51:49.880\nIt's all good.\n\n51:49.880 --> 51:53.880\nI just don't know anything about comedy or directing or, you know, those things you\n\n51:53.880 --> 51:54.880\nguys are talking about.\n\n51:54.880 --> 51:55.880\nRight.\n\n51:55.880 --> 52:01.720\nBut otherwise you could be sure I'd be in there with barbs and jabs and bits.\n\n52:01.720 --> 52:03.440\nWhy don't we talk about barbs?\n\n52:03.440 --> 52:04.440\nOh, man.\n\n52:04.440 --> 52:06.440\nYou want to talk about barbs for a second?\n\n52:06.440 --> 52:08.920\nCan we do a little barb corner?\n\n52:08.920 --> 52:09.920\nYeah.\n\n52:09.920 --> 52:10.920\nBarb Thomas.\n\n52:10.920 --> 52:13.440\nJesus Christ.\n\n52:13.440 --> 52:15.240\nAdrienne Barbo.\n\n52:15.240 --> 52:16.240\nThere we go.\n\n52:16.240 --> 52:18.480\nHey, Jason, Barb is in there.\n\n52:18.480 --> 52:20.560\nJason, you brought a basketball earlier.\n\n52:20.560 --> 52:21.560\nYou and I.\n\n52:21.560 --> 52:22.560\nNo.\n\n52:22.560 --> 52:23.560\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n52:23.560 --> 52:24.560\nThis is.\n\n52:24.560 --> 52:25.560\nNo, no.\n\n52:25.560 --> 52:28.560\nThis is, this is more about comedy than about sports.\n\n52:28.560 --> 52:30.560\nJason and I, Jason grew up in Kansas.\n\n52:30.560 --> 52:31.560\nCorrect.\n\n52:31.560 --> 52:33.920\nHe used to play with some dudes from the J-hawks, right?\n\n52:33.920 --> 52:34.920\nLike from the team.\n\n52:34.920 --> 52:35.920\nSure.\n\n52:35.920 --> 52:36.920\nYeah.\n\n52:36.920 --> 52:37.920\nYeah.\n\n52:37.920 --> 52:38.920\nI mean.\n\n52:38.920 --> 52:39.920\nAnd Jason Sonegas, this dude can play basketball.\n\n52:39.920 --> 52:40.920\nHe's really good.\n\n52:40.920 --> 52:41.920\nWell, not compared to those guys.\n\n52:41.920 --> 52:47.920\nBut compared to everybody probably here, I would say, I can get rebound.\n\n52:47.920 --> 52:53.040\nBut also like, you love your high top basketball shoes to the extent that you're, we went\n\n52:53.040 --> 52:54.040\nto your house.\n\n52:54.040 --> 52:58.760\nYou got a room, you got a whole walk-in closet that's just for your high top basketball shoes,\n\n52:58.760 --> 52:59.760\nwhich is.\n\n52:59.760 --> 53:00.760\nThere's low tops too.\n\n53:00.760 --> 53:01.760\nYeah.\n\n53:01.760 --> 53:03.760\nI mean, with that much room, you got to have low tops too.\n\n53:03.760 --> 53:06.920\nDo you have any medium tops?\n\n53:06.920 --> 53:07.920\nThree-quarter tops?\n\n53:07.920 --> 53:08.920\nYeah.\n\n53:08.920 --> 53:09.920\nI'm wearing some.\n\n53:09.920 --> 53:10.920\nDamn, those tops are three-quarters.\n\n53:10.920 --> 53:11.920\nYou are kidding.\n\n53:11.920 --> 53:12.920\nLook at those tops.\n\n53:12.920 --> 53:13.920\nYeah.\n\n53:13.920 --> 53:14.920\nThey don't go all the way up.\n\n53:14.920 --> 53:15.920\nSo Jason and I.\n\n53:15.920 --> 53:16.920\nAnd they don't go all the way down either.\n\n53:16.920 --> 53:17.920\nThey're kind of like, split the difference tops.\n\n53:17.920 --> 53:18.920\nThey can't make a choice.\n\n53:18.920 --> 53:19.920\nThose tops, those tops split the difference.\n\n53:19.920 --> 53:20.920\nOh.\n\n53:20.920 --> 53:45.440\nBetween the high and the low, those are some Wednesday tops, 50% of the tops.\n\n53:45.440 --> 53:49.960\nSo Jason and I went to go play basketball.\n\n53:49.960 --> 53:50.960\nSo we went to a.\n\n53:50.960 --> 53:51.960\nJustifying.\n\n53:51.960 --> 53:54.960\nWe went to a basketball court.\n\n53:54.960 --> 53:55.960\nWe went to a basketball court.\n\n53:55.960 --> 53:56.960\nCosby at the end.\n\n53:56.960 --> 54:00.960\nThose are some Wednesday tops.\n\n54:00.960 --> 54:10.160\nThose are, those tops are completely, those tops are, I'm telling you Camille, those\n\n54:10.160 --> 54:15.200\ntops are halfway up the ankle.\n\n54:15.200 --> 54:16.200\nThat's not funny anymore.\n\n54:16.200 --> 54:17.200\nI know it's not.\n\n54:17.200 --> 54:18.200\nNo.\n\n54:18.200 --> 54:20.200\nIt is.\n\n54:20.200 --> 54:21.200\nIt is actually.\n\n54:21.200 --> 54:22.200\nIt is.\n\n54:22.200 --> 54:23.200\nIt's getting funnier.\n\n54:23.200 --> 54:24.200\nThe fact that we're not talking about why it isn't funny.\n\n54:24.200 --> 54:25.200\nWe're making it really funny.\n\n54:25.200 --> 54:26.200\nAnd you were with Camille.\n\n54:26.200 --> 54:27.200\nIt's really funny.\n\n54:27.200 --> 54:34.680\nSo Jason and I go play a pickup game in West Hollywood, like on San Vicente.\n\n54:34.680 --> 54:40.000\nAnd I played there before and it's, it's pretty intense, like pickup basketball game.\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:43.800\nAnd some of the guys that talk a lot of trash, it's a lot of like a lot of big mouths.\n\n54:43.800 --> 54:46.560\nAnd it's usually the guys that aren't that good that are talking the most trash.\n\n54:46.560 --> 54:47.560\nOh.\n\n54:47.560 --> 54:48.880\nBut isn't that just the truth?\n\n54:48.880 --> 54:50.880\nIsn't that?\n\n54:50.880 --> 54:53.120\nSo I missed my free throw.\n\n54:53.120 --> 54:54.760\nYou got to make a free throw to get in the game.\n\n54:54.760 --> 54:55.760\nI missed my free throw.\n\n54:55.760 --> 54:56.760\nJason gets on a team.\n\n54:56.760 --> 54:57.920\nSo I'm just chilling.\n\n54:57.920 --> 55:01.680\nAnd Jason, I think you matched up against one of the biggest loud mouths on the opposing\n\n55:01.680 --> 55:02.680\nteam.\n\n55:02.680 --> 55:03.680\nI usually do.\n\n55:03.680 --> 55:07.320\nAnd Jason had the funniest shit talk of all time.\n\n55:07.320 --> 55:09.280\nHe kept scoring on this dude.\n\n55:09.280 --> 55:12.960\nAnd every time he'd come down the court, he would say, do you know that they call me the\n\n55:12.960 --> 55:13.960\nelectrician?\n\n55:13.960 --> 55:15.960\nLike he would, he would have a new occupation.\n\n55:15.960 --> 55:20.920\nSo he'd be dribbin' the ball, and the guy hated him so much, he's like, they call me\n\n55:20.920 --> 55:23.920\nthe electrician, and he'd shoot it, and he goes, because I'm puttin' the lights out.\n\n55:23.920 --> 55:27.800\nWhat were the other ones?\n\n55:27.800 --> 55:28.800\nI'm sure the waiter.\n\n55:28.800 --> 55:29.800\nWhat was the waiter?\n\n55:29.800 --> 55:34.720\nLike, dropping, no, no, no, the waiter was servin' up funky dishes.\n\n55:34.720 --> 55:39.240\nThere was the plumber.\n\n55:39.240 --> 55:42.800\nClumsy cashier was droppin' dimes.\n\n55:42.800 --> 55:45.800\nI like that you could be there.\n\n55:45.800 --> 55:51.120\nYou'd be so good at basketball that you'd become bad at another job.\n\n55:51.120 --> 55:56.120\nThey call me the terrible mailman, because I'm not bringing anything to you.\n\n55:56.120 --> 55:59.120\nGet out of my diner, don't play basketball!\n\n55:59.120 --> 56:01.120\nI said get!\n\n56:01.120 --> 56:07.800\nBut I remember the other team- I'm such a terrible janitor at this diner, I should\n\n56:07.800 --> 56:10.800\nbe mere!\n\n56:10.800 --> 56:16.720\nYeah, a lot of people don't sniff that out, right?\n\n56:16.720 --> 56:20.840\nWhat book did he read that made him think he could be Mary Harrell Hill Valley?\n\n56:20.840 --> 56:24.960\nBut there was a point when you were pissing off that guy, that even his own teammates\n\n56:24.960 --> 56:29.080\nwere laughing at him, because you kept clownin' him, and it was the greatest.\n\n56:29.080 --> 56:32.800\nI just remembered one thing from the Mushroom Adventure.\n\n56:32.800 --> 56:39.840\nAfter my hand was laid on the surface of the water, and I communed with all life, Cody\n\n56:39.840 --> 56:46.440\nwas back in the bungalow, rolling around on the bed, because it was soft, and then\n\n56:46.440 --> 56:53.960\nI went and we made the mistake of trying all kinds of things, but you don't need to know\n\n56:53.960 --> 56:56.360\nabout that, or picture it.\n\n56:56.360 --> 56:58.120\nI want to know everything about that.\n\n56:58.120 --> 57:00.600\nI want to know a little bit about that.\n\n57:00.600 --> 57:08.400\nBut there was a point, I wrote down the quote, both individually rolling around, because\n\n57:08.400 --> 57:13.280\nfor me the ceiling was like a pool, and there was like, I might fall in it if I close my\n\n57:13.280 --> 57:26.680\neyes, and then Cody said, I want a baby, or maybe, or maybe I just want a soft bathrobe.\n\n57:26.680 --> 57:28.680\nAnd she should have the right to make that choice.\n\n57:28.680 --> 57:29.680\nNo, no, that's...\n\n57:29.680 --> 57:30.680\nThat is a woman's decision.\n\n57:30.680 --> 57:31.680\nThat is a woman's decision.\n\n57:31.680 --> 57:32.680\nAlright guys, thanks so much.\n\n57:32.680 --> 57:43.360\nIt's one of the two though for sure, so it's a kind of...\n\n57:43.360 --> 57:47.240\nJason, can we talk about this the first time that I ever did it?\n\n57:47.240 --> 57:48.240\nAre you okay talking about it?\n\n57:48.240 --> 57:49.240\nThe mushrooms?\n\n57:49.240 --> 57:50.240\nYeah.\n\n57:50.240 --> 57:51.240\nWhat do you mean, like sponsors and stuff?\n\n57:51.240 --> 57:52.240\nYeah.\n\n57:52.240 --> 57:53.240\nLike my AA sponsors?\n\n57:53.240 --> 57:54.240\nExactly.\n\n57:54.240 --> 57:55.240\nNo, I'm fine with it.\n\n57:55.240 --> 57:56.240\nThe first time I ever did mushrooms was...\n\n57:56.240 --> 57:57.240\nWhat was your friend's name?\n\n57:57.240 --> 57:58.240\nMike.\n\n57:58.240 --> 57:59.240\nMike Lucas.\n\n57:59.240 --> 58:00.240\nAnd the three of us, we did it, and we went to your apartment.\n\n58:00.240 --> 58:03.120\nIs that the correct thing that it was right on the intersection where Tupac was murdered?\n\n58:03.120 --> 58:04.680\nYeah, Flamingo and Koval, yeah.\n\n58:04.680 --> 58:07.520\nThey'd cleaned it up since then, but yeah, it was...\n\n58:07.520 --> 58:10.480\nYeah, that's where it was.\n\n58:10.480 --> 58:12.440\nThe meridian was the name of the...\n\n58:12.440 --> 58:17.040\nThere was a little ritual that you guys put me through at the beginning, we chopped up\n\n58:17.040 --> 58:20.960\nthe stems and the caps, and there was some little vehicle, like a little choo-choo train\n\n58:20.960 --> 58:21.960\nor a little...\n\n58:21.960 --> 58:26.880\nThat was all improvised, like that was Mike being stoned before, I think, on mushrooms,\n\n58:26.880 --> 58:28.480\nand just a very, like, creative guy.\n\n58:28.480 --> 58:30.920\nThere was, like, a little, like, wheelbarrow or choo-choo train.\n\n58:30.920 --> 58:34.480\nWe created, like, a little, like, a little, um, altar kind of thing, ceremonial altar.\n\n58:34.480 --> 58:37.600\nYeah, and you had to make a wish, and you had to push the choo-choo train with the mushrooms\n\n58:37.600 --> 58:38.600\nin it.\n\n58:38.600 --> 58:39.600\nYeah, I remember that.\n\n58:39.600 --> 58:40.600\nAnd if it fell over, that was good luck or bad luck.\n\n58:40.600 --> 58:41.600\nOh, yeah!\n\n58:41.600 --> 58:42.600\nThat all makes sense.\n\n58:42.600 --> 58:43.600\nWhy do we even need these drugs?\n\n58:43.600 --> 58:44.600\nYeah.\n\n58:44.600 --> 58:45.600\nWhat are we doing?\n\n58:45.600 --> 58:46.600\nWe're fine!\n\n58:46.600 --> 58:47.600\nSo, we're fine.\n\n58:47.600 --> 58:48.600\nDo zips, abs, up, and hit the town.\n\n58:48.600 --> 58:49.600\nExactly.\n\n58:49.600 --> 58:50.600\nSo, yeah.\n\n58:50.600 --> 58:51.600\nSo, three of us...\n\n58:51.600 --> 58:56.600\nYeah, when you're that desperate to have a good time together, you probably will.\n\n58:56.600 --> 58:57.600\nAll you need?\n\n58:57.600 --> 58:58.600\nYeah.\n\n58:58.600 --> 58:59.600\nEx-body spray.\n\n58:59.600 --> 59:05.240\nSo, for some reason, we do something really non-intuitive.\n\n59:05.240 --> 59:09.440\nWe all go to the Hard Rock Casino, which is just a bunch of assholes.\n\n59:09.440 --> 59:10.440\nOh, my God, the worst.\n\n59:10.440 --> 59:14.160\nBut we stood there in the circle bar in the middle of the casino, and I remember the three\n\n59:14.160 --> 59:15.160\nof us...\n\n59:15.160 --> 59:16.160\nWhy is it called the Circle Bar?\n\n59:16.160 --> 59:18.160\nIt's a great question.\n\n59:18.160 --> 59:19.160\nIt's a good question.\n\n59:19.160 --> 59:20.160\nFair question.\n\n59:20.160 --> 59:21.160\nYep.\n\n59:21.160 --> 59:25.600\nUh, because it was named after Jonathan Circle, who discovered it while chasing a bear.\n\n59:25.600 --> 59:29.840\nUh, it's a circular bar in the middle of the casino, which is also a circularly shape.\n\n59:29.840 --> 59:32.240\nDidn't we end up calling it like the Shark's Nest or something?\n\n59:32.240 --> 59:33.680\nWe had some weird name for it.\n\n59:33.680 --> 59:35.160\nYeah, because, well, we...\n\n59:35.160 --> 59:36.160\nI had this...\n\n59:36.160 --> 59:39.760\nAnd, like, we stood there like a little triangle facing each other.\n\n59:39.760 --> 59:40.760\nAt the Circle Bar.\n\n59:40.760 --> 59:41.760\nYeah, right?\n\n59:41.760 --> 59:42.760\nLike, like, three squares.\n\n59:42.760 --> 59:45.760\nSomething's wrong with this picture.\n\n59:45.760 --> 59:48.720\nBut people kept coming up to us...\n\n59:48.720 --> 59:52.040\nWhy are you at the Circle Bar if you're in a triangle position?\n\n59:52.040 --> 59:53.280\nDo it as Bill Cosby.\n\n59:53.280 --> 59:54.760\nWhy are you in the...\n\n59:54.760 --> 59:55.760\nI can't do it.\n\n59:55.760 --> 59:56.760\nAll right.\n\n59:56.760 --> 59:57.760\nAll right.\n\n59:57.760 --> 59:58.760\nSo...\n\n59:58.760 --> 59:59.760\nExcuse me.\n\n59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.760\nNo, no, I can't do it.\n\n01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.760\nI'm going.\n\n01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.760\nPeople were...\n\n01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:08.160\nWe were just laughing so hard and finishing each other's sentences, and there were moments\n\n01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.080\nwhere we weren't talking at all, and we were just, like, like, making eye contact and\n\n01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.960\nlaughing, and I was like, what did you think I just said?\n\n01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.960\nYeah.\n\n01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.120\nAnd you would say exactly what I thought.\n\n01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.120\nWe were all...\n\n01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120\nIt was a good...\n\n01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.920\nIt was a good hive mind going on, for sure.\n\n01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.920\nSo this guy came up and he had, like, a bad, like, kind of a shiny shirt he bought at a\n\n01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.120\nVegas store, and he kind of looked like he was having a bad night, and, like, he was,\n\n01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.760\nlike, one of the few people that came up to us and said, hey, is it okay if I hang out\n\n01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.760\nwith you guys?\n\n01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.760\nOh.\n\n01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.760\nWe were like, why?\n\n01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.360\nLike, because, like, you guys are having so much fun.\n\n01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.360\nWe're...\n\n01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.360\nLike, you can hang out.\n\n01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.360\nSo he laughed and laughed and laughed.\n\n01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.360\nThen we stood by the...\n\n01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.360\nThe...\n\n01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.360\nNear the bathrooms.\n\n01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.360\nWere the trombones in the air?\n\n01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.360\nYeah.\n\n01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.360\nSaxophones.\n\n01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.360\nIt was...\n\n01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.360\nThere was, like, a chandelier made of saxophones.\n\n01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.080\nAnd there's a dome, and so, like, you can hear the sounds from across the other side.\n\n01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.280\nSo if someone's walking that way, their voice hits the dome, and it sounds like they're\n\n01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.280\nbehind you.\n\n01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.560\nYou maybe have seen, like, that, like, rotunda, kind of, yeah.\n\n01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.560\nAnd we're laughing and laughing.\n\n01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.680\nAnd you were going nuts at this point, you know?\n\n01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680\nLike...\n\n01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.680\nIt was...\n\n01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680\nIt was six hours of just, like, hysteria.\n\n01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.240\nThe thing I was talking about today, because when it came up when you get...\n\n01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.360\nWhen I knew what you guys did yesterday, I was at this, you know, barbecue, and drugs\n\n01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360\ncame up.\n\n01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.360\nNot that we had any.\n\n01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.360\nWe didn't.\n\n01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.960\nBut I talked about mushrooms, and the thing I talked about was that I remember really\n\n01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.440\nwell, people walking to the bathroom, and then them walking out and being able to tell\n\n01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.960\nso clearly by, like, their aura, their whole vibe that they got, went and did cocaine.\n\n01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:31.960\nLike, I swear to God.\n\n01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:32.960\nIt was like...\n\n01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.960\nIt was like...\n\n01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.960\nOh, look at...\n\n01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.960\nOh, she's pretty cute.\n\n01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:36.960\nOh, wow.\n\n01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.960\nThere you...\n\n01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:38.960\nJesus, what did she do?\n\n01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.960\nLike...\n\n01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.960\nAnd nothing...\n\n01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:41.960\nNothing visual.\n\n01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:42.960\nIt was just, like, this...\n\n01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.960\nLike, a ramped-up energy that you're like, what was going on?\n\n01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.960\nAnd I'm, like, such a bumpkin when it came to that stuff.\n\n01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.960\nAnd then we just had, like, people that just wanted to be with us and hang out.\n\n01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.960\nYeah, yeah, we were...\n\n01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.960\nSo happy.\n\n01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.960\nYeah, we were...\n\n01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.960\nAnd we were like...\n\n01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:53.960\nWe were all, like, three Jimmy Stewart's.\n\n01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.960\nWe were just like, hey, how you doing?\n\n01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.960\nLike, anybody that came down...\n\n01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960\nAnd then you...\n\n01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.640\nI mean, you are tall as shit.\n\n01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.960\nMike was tall as shit and bald, like, you know, like shaved head.\n\n01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.960\nAnd then...\n\n01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960\nSo I was just...\n\n01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960\nAnd I was just in the middle there, you know, point guard, and I was like...\n\n01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960\nWe were just having...\n\n01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960\nServing up fucking dishes.\n\n01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.960\nServing up the high dishes, up top.\n\n01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960\nYeah.\n\n01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.960\nSo I had...\n\n01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.960\nAt this time, I had been to the hard rock probably four or five times in my life before\n\n01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:18.960\nthat.\n\n01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.960\nAnd so the next time I go there, it's about a year later, and I walk into the circle bar\n\n01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.680\nand I'm like, oh, this is the place.\n\n01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.960\nAnd I walk up to the bartender and I said, because this is wooden, like, staircases\n\n01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.860\nthat go up into the circle bar.\n\n01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.860\nAnd it was stationary.\n\n01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.960\nI'm like, when did this stop being a rotating bar?\n\n01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.960\nAnd the guy's like, what?\n\n01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.960\nI go, this used to be a rotating bar.\n\n01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.960\nAnd he goes, no, I go, oh, shit.\n\n01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960\nYeah.\n\n01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.960\nYeah.\n\n01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.960\nYeah.\n\n01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.960\nI remember it because the lights would always make you feel like you're like...\n\n01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:55.960\nThere'd be a guy that was standing perfectly still, but in my mind, he was going in a circle.\n\n01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.960\nHe was orbiting like a planet.\n\n01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.960\nAnd then he would reappear over there.\n\n01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.960\nI'm like, man, these people just keep spinning around us.\n\n01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.960\nIt was so great.\n\n01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960\nMy favorite time, you weren't there, but...\n\n01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.960\nAnd I hope he doesn't mind me saying this, but I just think it's one of the funniest\n\n01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.960\nthings I've ever seen.\n\n01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.960\nI know the mushrooms help, but I think you have to be able to...\n\n01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960\nIf you've been to Vegas, you can picture this.\n\n01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:20.960\nDan Backadal, who also did Second City with me in Vegas, a bunch of us got together.\n\n01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.960\nI think Jeremy might have been there.\n\n01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.960\nWe were out in front of the Bellagio with those dancing...\n\n01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.960\nThey call them the Dancing Fountains and everything.\n\n01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.960\nAnd we're all deciding...\n\n01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.960\nMushrooms basically is like, especially at Vegas, is like, you go to a pack.\n\n01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.960\nYou stand in a circle.\n\n01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.960\nYou laugh at all the fucking crazy shit going on around you, above you, behind you, walking by you.\n\n01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.960\nAnd then you walk for four feet to say, okay, let's go somewhere.\n\n01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960\nYou get there and then you're like...\n\n01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.960\nThen it happens again.\n\n01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.960\nThat's how we got there.\n\n01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960\nWe posted...\n\n01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.960\nWe had two locations, the bar and then the saxophone.\n\n01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.960\nWe kind of went back and forth to them.\n\n01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.960\nWe were inside the Bellagio and it was like fucking Mark's brothers.\n\n01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.960\nBut you also adopt...\n\n01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.960\nIf you're out of mushrooms, you also adopt different...\n\n01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.960\nIt's not just let's go back to the circle bar.\n\n01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.960\nIt's like, let's go to the cookie tree.\n\n01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.960\nThat's what it was.\n\n01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.960\nThe shark tank or whatever it was called.\n\n01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.960\nEverything becomes its own inside joke.\n\n01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.960\nIt's like, you're going around the monopoly board multiple times and renaming stuff.\n\n01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.960\nAnd so there's like a group of six of us and five of us over here.\n\n01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.960\nAnd then all of a sudden we just turn around and back at all, just watching the fountains.\n\n01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.960\nAnd we could slowly start to figure out that he's pretending like he's their choreographer.\n\n01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:37.960\nWe're all like...\n\n01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:42.960\nAnd he's doing it for us, but I think he really was doing it.\n\n01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.960\nIt was so brilliant.\n\n01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.960\nAnd he did it for like the rest of whatever fucking Selena...\n\n01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.960\nNot Selena Gomez, what's her name?\n\n01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960\nCeline Dion song at that point.\n\n01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.960\nThis was the 70s.\n\n01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.960\nMy heart will go on probably.\n\n01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.960\nIt probably was.\n\n01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.960\nYeah, some paparazzi song.\n\n01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.960\nIt was so fun.\n\n01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.960\nThat town's a mess.\n\n01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.960\nIt needs it.\n\n01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:10.960\nWhat do you guys think about people who are concerned about people doing drugs who don't?\n\n01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.960\nBecause I feel like there are some of them who are concerned about people,\n\n01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.960\nand that's why they're concerned about people doing drugs.\n\n01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:23.960\nAnd then I feel like there's the 85% of them that are getting high off of other people's drug use\n\n01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.960\nand are really happy to be concerned about something.\n\n01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.960\nLike the sanctimony of it?\n\n01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.960\nYeah.\n\n01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:33.960\nLike whether they're... Some of those people are recovered and then you kind of go,\n\n01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:39.960\nokay, so you fought a demon and you're happy about it and now you want that to be your thing.\n\n01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:45.960\nBut then still some people, I think there's just a little slice of genuinely evil people\n\n01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.960\nwho have never done it, will never need to do it, have never done anything,\n\n01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.960\nhave never cared about anyone and are kind of feeling the unconscious suspicion\n\n01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.960\nthat maybe they're sociopaths or that they'll never have a connection to anybody.\n\n01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.960\nAnd that they've found this loophole in society where there's this thing where it's like,\n\n01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.960\noh, I'm so concerned about that person.\n\n01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:10.960\nAnd it's like they found this little shortcut between this little wormhole that society offers\n\n01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:17.960\nwhere you can simultaneously be a good person but be the most villainous piece of shit in the world\n\n01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:21.960\nthat doesn't care about anyone and has never done anything nice for anybody.\n\n01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.960\nIt's just filled with emotional toxicity and passive aggression.\n\n01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.960\nIt just siphons the life force off of everyone around you.\n\n01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.960\nA good sativa would help that, you know?\n\n01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:39.960\nJust like a little boop, not a boop, a boop, they'd be gone.\n\n01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:43.960\nYeah, and I think they know that and I think that they feel that that would be annihilation\n\n01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:47.960\nbecause it would be eliminating the part of them that is more them than the rest of them.\n\n01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.960\nAnd I think that they don't like being surrounded with any reminders\n\n01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:56.960\nthat maybe you should just relax and not have that much of an opinion about anybody else.\n\n01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.960\nAnd they kind of enjoy the fact that statistically speaking,\n\n01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.960\nsooner or later, people who are okay with drugs,\n\n01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.960\nstatistically speaking, every once in a while one of them dies or has a problem or gets sick.\n\n01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.960\nAnd I think they kind of fucking love that.\n\n01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.960\nI think they really love that.\n\n01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.960\nI think they love that as much as we, just Western society,\n\n01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:21.960\nloves the fact that every once in a while a suicide vest goes off prematurely.\n\n01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.960\nWe were stoked to hear about that.\n\n01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.960\nAnd I think there are people who show up at memorials for writers that overdose.\n\n01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.960\nThey're there for the same reason I am on the surface,\n\n01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.960\nbut underneath it they're like, this is fucking cool.\n\n01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.960\nI knew I was right.\n\n01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:37.960\nMaybe.\n\n01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.960\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.960\nAnd some of those people run shows\n\n01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:46.960\nand some of those people spread their cult to everyone underneath them and fuck you.\n\n01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.960\nDo they know who they are?\n\n01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.960\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.960\nLet's keep it that way.\n\n01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.960\nYou can just tell me, you can just address me directly, Dan.\n\n01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.960\nCome on, man.\n\n01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.960\nNo, the entire time you were saying that,\n\n01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.960\nI was thinking about the father from the guy from Footloose,\n\n01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.960\nwho just, if he just danced, if he just tried to dance once.\n\n01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.960\nAnd he did once at his wedding or something, you know.\n\n01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.960\nWas that, I never saw Footloose.\n\n01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.960\nNo, no, I did, but you never saw Footloose.\n\n01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:16.960\nBut you get it.\n\n01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.960\nBut you get it.\n\n01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.960\nYeah.\n\n01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960\nHow have you never seen Footloose?\n\n01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:20.960\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.960\nYou know the song though, right?\n\n01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:26.960\nI haven't seen, what's the, not Goonies, what's the other, I've seen Goonies.\n\n01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960\nWhat's the other one that?\n\n01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960\nStar Trek.\n\n01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.960\nThe other one, King Kong.\n\n01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960\nNo, I haven't seen Goonies.\n\n01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.960\nI saw Gremlins, but I haven't seen Goonies.\n\n01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:38.960\nBut Will, this is really weird to me because in your Wikipedia page it said that recently...\n\n01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.960\nYou've seen Goonies.\n\n01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.960\nRecently.\n\n01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.960\nIt says in your Wikipedia page you've seen Goonies.\n\n01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:48.960\nI like to get it out there that I've seen Goonies, but it's like a, you got to update that.\n\n01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.960\nRecently you were in a radio play performance.\n\n01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.960\nYou're doing something on Broadway now, it's like a radio play that's, it's an adaptation\n\n01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.960\nof Footloose, isn't it?\n\n01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.960\nYou were...\n\n01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:02.960\nIt's a loose...\n\n01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.960\nLike it's a...\n\n01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960\nA loose Footloose?\n\n01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.960\nFootlooser?\n\n01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.960\nIt's kind of foot, foot, foot tighter.\n\n01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.960\nFoot tighter.\n\n01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960\nFoot tighter because it's still loose.\n\n01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.960\nAnd the subtitle is a loose interpretation of the Footloose.\n\n01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.960\nIs that a working title or is that a done deal?\n\n01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.960\nDoesn't matter, doesn't matter.\n\n01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.960\nIs it alright if we do, if we do a scene from, from that?\n\n01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.960\nYeah.\n\n01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.960\nLike, like, like...\n\n01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:23.960\nSure.\n\n01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.960\nYou play the Kevin Bacon role, Thaddeus foot.\n\n01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960\nYes.\n\n01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:34.960\nUm, and uh, well let's, like, like, like, like, you guys are off book, right?\n\n01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.960\nYeah, but it's only because I've seen it a bunch.\n\n01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:37.960\nRight.\n\n01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:38.960\nSchrab, you know the performance we're talking about.\n\n01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.960\nI'm not studied in it.\n\n01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.960\nI might pass out.\n\n01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.960\nYeah?\n\n01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.960\nI don't feel really good right now.\n\n01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.960\nWhat's, what's wrong?\n\n01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.960\nNo, we're starting the show, right?\n\n01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.960\nOh...\n\n01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.960\nOh.\n\n01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.960\nShit, this is...\n\n01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.960\nMaybe...\n\n01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:54.960\nI...\n\n01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.960\nYou just need to dance.\n\n01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.960\nOh, this, by the way, this is, um, they do this amazing thing in the show where, like,\n\n01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.960\nif you're sitting in the audience, this is happening two seats down from you.\n\n01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.960\nThis is like a thing that happens.\n\n01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.960\nI will never...\n\n01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.960\nMark my words.\n\n01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.960\nI will never, ever, ever dance.\n\n01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.960\nPeriod.\n\n01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.960\nUh...\n\n01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960\nThat's the end.\n\n01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.960\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.960\nThat's the end.\n\n01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960\nYeah.\n\n01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960\nIsn't that quick?\n\n01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960\nThat's the end of the show?\n\n01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:27.960\nWe did not get good reviews.\n\n01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.960\nYeah.\n\n01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.960\nThat is true.\n\n01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.960\nI gotta test that.\n\n01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.960\nWait, so the show starts with two people, the audience doing that, and that's the end\n\n01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.960\nof the show?\n\n01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:36.960\nYep.\n\n01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.960\nOh yeah, easy to say now.\n\n01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.960\nYeah.\n\n01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.960\nIt sounds stupid when you say it.\n\n01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:47.960\nI will say the production budget is so inexpensive that it actually kind of makes money.\n\n01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.960\nYeah, it's the always sunny in Philadelphia of Broadway shows.\n\n01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:55.960\nIt's like, it's the most profitable Broadway show in America on Broadway.\n\n01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.960\nYeah, we don't even need a stage.\n\n01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:02.960\nIt's brilliantly conceived, but I don't know, I just have a hard time when people finally\n\n01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:03.960\nget to see something.\n\n01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.960\nAll the work that went into that.\n\n01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.960\nAnd then for you, just the chip away at it.\n\n01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.960\nIt's like, you know what I mean, it's easy to do now.\n\n01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.960\nI just feel like it had first, second, and third act problems.\n\n01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:21.960\nYeah, no, I don't disagree there, but still, you know.\n\n01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.960\nDo you remember the Goonies show that you were in?\n\n01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.960\nThat was a longer time ago.\n\n01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:28.960\nI do remember.\n\n01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.960\nNever feed them after midnight.\n\n01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.960\nDo not get them wet.\n\n01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:40.960\nAnd a third thing.\n\n01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.960\nBut it's probably been discussed, I'm sure, on this exact show.\n\n01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.960\nBut when can they start feeding them again if it's after midnight?\n\n01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.960\nWell, isn't that answered in this scene from the Goonies play that you guys did?\n\n01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.960\nWhen Dan is trying to express to you guys, he wants to do some improv right now.\n\n01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:58.960\nOh shit, that was that.\n\n01:11:58.960 --> 01:11:59.960\nOh shit.\n\n01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.960\nIt's too seamless.\n\n01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.960\nIt goes right by me.\n\n01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:04.960\nYou're off duty.\n\n01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:05.960\nYou're off duty.\n\n01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.960\nI mean, I'm not explicit about it.\n\n01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.960\nJason and Will, what you guys don't know is that Harmontown over the years,\n\n01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.960\nwe're nearing our, is this our 199th episode?\n\n01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960\nIs that true?\n\n01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.960\nYeah.\n\n01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.960\nWow.\n\n01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.960\nThere we go.\n\n01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.960\nHere we go, everybody.\n\n01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.960\n199 episodes.\n\n01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.960\nChris and it, we got to break it over the-\n\n01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.960\nRight in this bottle.\n\n01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:34.960\nWhat, this show's, as much as a show used to be a kind of a,\n\n01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.960\nkind of a haphazard, loose, rambling thing,\n\n01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:45.960\nwe, I think we can say that we're one of the greatest long form improv shows of all time.\n\n01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:54.960\nIt's, we do some of the most well crafted storytelling character driven long form improv.\n\n01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.960\nWhat was the suggestion, indulgence?\n\n01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.960\nIt was indulgence and goonies.\n\n01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:02.960\nIt was.\n\n01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:03.960\nIt was goonies too.\n\n01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.960\nIt's nice we finally got back to it.\n\n01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.960\nYeah.\n\n01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960\nPeople love that.\n\n01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.960\nDid the person that suggested, still here?\n\n01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:09.960\n2011.\n\n01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.960\nI'd like to take this moment to thank Jane for bringing me a special absence, by the way.\n\n01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:14.960\nOoh.\n\n01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.960\nOh yeah.\n\n01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.960\nDo you guys want to try some of this?\n\n01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.960\nThis shit gets you high.\n\n01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.960\nIs it a real deal?\n\n01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960\nIt's a real deal.\n\n01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.960\nThe wormwood gets in the brain.\n\n01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.960\nYou see the gritting fairy.\n\n01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.960\nJane, did you make this glass too?\n\n01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.960\nI commissioned it.\n\n01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.960\nYou commissioned the glass?\n\n01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.960\nJane works at Corning Institute, right?\n\n01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:32.960\nCorning Glassworks.\n\n01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.960\nCorning Glassworks.\n\n01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.960\nShe's the Tony Stark of glass blowing.\n\n01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:36.960\nTechnology.\n\n01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.960\nAnd she said she has a gift for us.\n\n01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:40.960\nHe's got half of it.\n\n01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.960\nDo you want to present, do you want to present that gift now?\n\n01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.960\nIt seems like a good time.\n\n01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.960\nOh, look at this.\n\n01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:45.960\nOh.\n\n01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:46.960\nIt's beautiful tumblers.\n\n01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.960\nCan you, do you want to explain it?\n\n01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.960\nExplain it.\n\n01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.960\nIt's a glass.\n\n01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.960\nIt's a sodium calcium silicate.\n\n01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.960\nNo.\n\n01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.960\nCan you be more specific?\n\n01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.960\nTwenty-eight percent calcium oxide.\n\n01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.960\nBelieve me, I can do it.\n\n01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.960\nSorry.\n\n01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.960\nAt what temperature do those two elements bond together and form glass?\n\n01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:09.960\nFahrenheit or centigrade?\n\n01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.960\nLet's go centigrade.\n\n01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.960\nOh, gosh, no, let's do Fahrenheit.\n\n01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.960\nCome on, I'm the guest.\n\n01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.960\nI'm bi, I can do both.\n\n01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.960\nYeah, but thank you.\n\n01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.960\nGive us both, but put them in whatever order you want.\n\n01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.960\n2150 Fahrenheit.\n\n01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.960\n2150.\n\n01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.960\nThat's when you get everything all melted in.\n\n01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.960\nYou can gather it and work it.\n\n01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:30.960\n2150.\n\n01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.960\nAbout, yeah, about 1150 centigrade or Celsius, I should say.\n\n01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.960\nDamn, damn, damn, damn.\n\n01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.960\nSo, yeah, so I, you've got the double rocks.\n\n01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.960\nYou've got the single rocks glass.\n\n01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.960\nThese were designed, I designed them.\n\n01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.960\nSo based on, perfect.\n\n01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:44.960\nThat's what it's for.\n\n01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:45.960\nWell done.\n\n01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:46.960\nIt works.\n\n01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.960\nBut so there's supposed to be sort of a mash-up of a classic rocks glass with the solo cup,\n\n01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.960\nwhich is sort of one of the symbols of Harmontown.\n\n01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.960\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.960\nSo in honor of the 200th episode for Jeff and Dan,\n\n01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.960\nhe's got the absent of Malice.\n\n01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.960\nTake a big swing out that will, because we had a guest when we were in New York,\n\n01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.960\nRory, what was Rory's last name, Dan?\n\n01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.960\nAlbanese.\n\n01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.960\nYeah, yeah, Albanese.\n\n01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.960\nAnd he got, he lost his fucking mind.\n\n01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.960\nHe did.\n\n01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.960\nHe went completely bonkers.\n\n01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.960\nRory was drinking it like Welch's Grape Soda.\n\n01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.960\nYeah, he was going at it.\n\n01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.960\nAt some point, I just took the bottle away from him.\n\n01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.960\nIt was like, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.960\nI want to taste it.\n\n01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.960\nDan's also got the earth shine.\n\n01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:31.960\nThe original that I brought in episode 7800 and how many episodes ago.\n\n01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:32.960\nLatest version.\n\n01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.960\nIt's actually not 135 proof now.\n\n01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.960\nI've dropped it down to about 110.\n\n01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.960\nSo you can actually drink it.\n\n01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.960\nOh.\n\n01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.960\nCheers.\n\n01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.960\nAlso, what I love, David.\n\n01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.960\nThe olive oil.\n\n01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.960\nNo, no.\n\n01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.960\nThat's the absence of Malice.\n\n01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.960\nYou take this, you infuse it with warm wood and about 15 or 20 other things.\n\n01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.960\nDistill it again.\n\n01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.960\nAdd some more color to it.\n\n01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.960\nAnd so that's homemade absence.\n\n01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.960\nThat's just homemade.\n\n01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.960\nIf you're listening at home right now, start a podcast.\n\n01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.960\nPeople just start making you booze.\n\n01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.960\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.960\nYeah.\n\n01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.960\nIt's what I'm here for.\n\n01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.960\nIt's called The Secret.\n\n01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.960\nI found my place.\n\n01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.960\nThese glasses are gorgeous.\n\n01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.960\nThank you so much.\n\n01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960\nThat's amazing.\n\n01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.960\nHey, Jane, thank you.\n\n01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:21.960\nJane says, I'm done with Sergio.\n\n01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.960\nTreats me like a rag doll.\n\n01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:27.960\nNineties.\n\n01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:33.960\nI was into Jane's addiction and Phil Collins at the exact same time.\n\n01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.960\nI was a master of both worlds.\n\n01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.960\nThat's your duality.\n\n01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.960\nThat's like your Batman Bruce Wayne.\n\n01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:43.960\nAll right.\n\n01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:51.960\nWell, so yeah, I was trying to pimp us to do a little improv thing because you're both\n\n01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.960\nso talented, but it didn't work out that way.\n\n01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:55.960\nOh, I fucked up.\n\n01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:56.960\nI fucked up.\n\n01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:57.960\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:58.960\nIt's not you guys.\n\n01:16:58.960 --> 01:16:59.960\nI didn't know you wanted more than that.\n\n01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.960\nIt's really, it's mostly Schrab who knows better.\n\n01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.960\nI mean, the only reason I started doing it is because Schrab started doing it.\n\n01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.960\nLike, I never wanted to do that in this show.\n\n01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.960\nAnd then Schrab would come on and he's delightful and he would like go into these dumb sketches.\n\n01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.960\nYou think I'm delightful, Dan?\n\n01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:22.960\nHere this whole time, I thought you didn't think about me like that.\n\n01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:27.960\nI thought, I thought, I thought you thought it was a fucking piece of shit.\n\n01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.960\nAnyways, here's, here's Will Forte's Goonies play.\n\n01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:40.960\nWe're going to do a scene from it that's premiering next week on Broadway at 9.\n\n01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:51.960\nDouglas, Douglas, it's 7.58 a.m. and the Goonies very hungry.\n\n01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:52.960\nGive them some to eat.\n\n01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:53.960\nThere's a half a sandwich in the fridge.\n\n01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.960\nI got to go to work.\n\n01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.960\nHow do we know what time is the appropriate save time?\n\n01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.960\nI guess we got to pop in the movie.\n\n01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.960\nThere's no need to pop in the movie.\n\n01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:10.960\nI told you after midnight, I'm the one that gave you that movie.\n\n01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:16.960\nClaudius Johnson, Tyrell Blackman.\n\n01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.960\nThanks, Claudius.\n\n01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.960\nBut Claudius, hear me out here.\n\n01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:30.960\nEven if it's 11.58 p.m., it's 23 hours and 58 minutes after midnight.\n\n01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.960\nHe makes a good point, Claudius.\n\n01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.960\nI got to go to work.\n\n01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:37.960\nY'all thinking with that ass burger brain.\n\n01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:38.960\nClaudius.\n\n01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.960\nYou got to feel the Goonie rules.\n\n01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:45.960\nFeel him in your heart and your mind will follow.\n\n01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.960\nMagical Blackman trope away!\n\n01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.960\nClaudius, Douglas, something's happening to me inside.\n\n01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.960\nI'm feeling something.\n\n01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.960\nThe left part of my body, upper part, by my chest.\n\n01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:00.960\nWhat's wrong?\n\n01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.960\nIt's beneath my rib cage.\n\n01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.960\nBlood's pumping through it.\n\n01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.960\nYour heart?\n\n01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.960\nThat must be it!\n\n01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:12.960\nOh, buddy, that's okay.\n\n01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.960\nEveryone's got a heart.\n\n01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.960\nNothing you got to be worried about.\n\n01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:19.960\nYou got to get to work.\n\n01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.960\nI hope it's not work.\n\n01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:23.960\nHello?\n\n01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.960\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.960\nWhen are you getting to work here?\n\n01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.960\nThese newspapers are piled up to the ceiling.\n\n01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:30.960\nWill you get over here?\n\n01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.960\nI can't even get out of my office.\n\n01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.960\nI can't get out of my office with all these newspapers piled up to the ceiling.\n\n01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.960\nExtra, extra.\n\n01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960\nOh, where should I put this one?\n\n01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.960\nHey, I'm on the phone.\n\n01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.960\nI'll just put it on top of this big pile.\n\n01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.960\nNow they're past the ceiling.\n\n01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:59.960\nHey, what...\n\n01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.960\nI really got to go.\n\n01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.960\nMaybe if...\n\n01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.960\nLook, look, we really got to figure this out.\n\n01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.960\nI'd love to.\n\n01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:07.960\nHang on.\n\n01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.960\nScar is 69.\n\n01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:10.960\nHello?\n\n01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.960\nHi, yeah.\n\n01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.960\nDouglas is...\n\n01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:14.960\nBe careful.\n\n01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.960\nIt's my own source of income.\n\n01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:16.960\nWho is this?\n\n01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:17.960\nI'm a busy man.\n\n01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:18.960\nOh, shit.\n\n01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.960\nSee?\n\n01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:21.960\nLot easier, right?\n\n01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:22.960\nLot easier than you'd think.\n\n01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.960\nAnd then you get in there and your whole mind goes nuts.\n\n01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.960\nHe's intimidating, but he pays so well.\n\n01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.960\nI know.\n\n01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.960\nBy the way, friggin' Star 69 still works.\n\n01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.960\nGod.\n\n01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.960\nWhy do you think this is my only source of income?\n\n01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.960\nBecause my prank phone call albums don't sell anymore.\n\n01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.960\nBecause I can't make them.\n\n01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.960\nLook, maybe...\n\n01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:49.960\nMaybe we can kiss this away.\n\n01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.960\nWhat?\n\n01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:51.960\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:52.960\nI touch you once.\n\n01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.960\nI touch you twice.\n\n01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:59.960\nI can't show with work with all that lipstick on my face.\n\n01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960\nPeople will think I'm a tramp.\n\n01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:02.960\nNo, I hate that.\n\n01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:03.960\nDon't show up to work.\n\n01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:09.960\nShow up to the wedding altar.\n\n01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:14.960\nAre you trying to tell me that you're going to spend your father's fortune on our life?\n\n01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:25.960\nI can't think of another thing that would be more worthy of that $750.\n\n01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:31.960\nWell, then I think on the way to the chapel, we go kill that son of a bitch.\n\n01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:38.960\nThat's why I love you.\n\n01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:47.960\nMeanwhile, I will always love you.\n\n01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:51.960\nI will always love you.\n\n01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.960\nAnd the fountains are going like this.\n\n01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.960\nAnd the fountains are like that.\n\n01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.960\nAnd Dan Backadall is doing the choreography.\n\n01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:03.960\nAnd the mushrooms are going...\n\n01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.960\nIs everybody on their phone?\n\n01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.960\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:06.960\nNo, we were watching.\n\n01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.960\nWe were enraptured.\n\n01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.960\nI feel like a good edit point.\n\n01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:10.960\nI don't know.\n\n01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:11.960\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.960\nMeanwhile, in Buddy's heart...\n\n01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.960\nI represent anger.\n\n01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.960\nI represent satisfaction.\n\n01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:29.960\nAnd I'm John Lovitz.\n\n01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.960\nBuddy's not satisfied anymore.\n\n01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.960\nThat's the ticket.\n\n01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.960\nLet's make him feel like dancing.\n\n01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:43.960\nOutside, Buddy.\n\n01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:44.960\nYeah, yeah, you were...\n\n01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.960\nI'm Douglas, your buddy.\n\n01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.960\nOh.\n\n01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:53.960\nYou know, sometimes when I don't take my medication, I forget my name and such.\n\n01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.960\nYeah, that's why you gotta take it every morning and night.\n\n01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:56.960\nBuddy?\n\n01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.960\nBuddy, it's your father.\n\n01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:04.960\nI overheard you talking about killing me and taking my fortune.\n\n01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960\nSir, that was mostly me.\n\n01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.960\nI gotta be honest.\n\n01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.960\nOh, Douglas!\n\n01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.960\nI never thought you two were a good match.\n\n01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.960\nI just wanted to let you know one thing.\n\n01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:18.960\nThere's a dance competition tonight.\n\n01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.960\nBuddy, Douglas.\n\n01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.960\nBuddy's father.\n\n01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:27.960\nThis is your father.\n\n01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:28.960\nOh, shit.\n\n01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:33.960\nI overheard you talking to Buddy and Douglas about the dance contest.\n\n01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.960\nYes, Daddy.\n\n01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960\nI thought you...\n\n01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.960\nI thought you died decades ago.\n\n01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.960\nDeath is a figment.\n\n01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.960\nTime is man's enemy.\n\n01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:49.960\nOh, I gotta go to work.\n\n01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:55.960\nYou will go to work if you and I switch places.\n\n01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.960\nBecause I'm jealous of your youth.\n\n01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:03.960\nAnd you need to learn about acumen.\n\n01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:07.960\nOkay, but I mean, should I just like switch outfits so you want to go to work for me?\n\n01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.960\nThat sounds awesome.\n\n01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.960\nI will tell you this.\n\n01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:10.960\nIt won't work that way.\n\n01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.960\nDad?\n\n01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:12.960\nYeah, hold on.\n\n01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.960\nDad, I overheard you talking about switching places with my son.\n\n01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:19.960\nYou know, we have a goonie in the basement.\n\n01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:20.960\nIf you think...\n\n01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.960\nOh, fuck it. I'm just gonna feed him.\n\n01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.960\nOh, no. No!\n\n01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.960\nPa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.\n\n01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:34.960\nPa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.\n\n01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.960\nSlamming.\n\n01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.960\nBrazz, that's our tank.\n\n01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:37.960\nWe need a machine gun!\n\n01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:38.960\nOh, no. A machine gun.\n\n01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.960\nPa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.\n\n01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:41.960\nMe-na, me-n-mine-mine.\n\n01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:42.960\nWhat have you done?\n\n01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:43.960\nMe-n-mine-mine-mine.\n\n01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.960\nWhat have you done?\n\n01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:45.960\nYou got this?\n\n01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:46.960\nBuddy...\n\n01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:53.960\nOh, come on.\n\n01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.960\nOh, come on.\n\n01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:00.960\nOh, come on.\n\n01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:06.960\nOh, don't you fools know that if you feed a goonie any time after midnight, even if\n\n01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.960\nit's in the PM of the next day, that their nipples start to shoot laser beams?\n\n01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.960\nBut it's not the PM of the next day.\n\n01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.960\nIt's 8.02 AM.\n\n01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.960\nOh, shit.\n\n01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.960\nWoof-woof-woof-woof-woof!\n\n01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.960\nOw!\n\n01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.960\nOw!\n\n01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.960\nOw!\n\n01:25:25.960 -->

did you feed me?\n\n01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.960\nI fed him.\n\n01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.960\nSweeties.\n\n01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.320\nSweeties, I'm a fat piece of shit now.\n\n01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.640\nI'm so sad.\n\n01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.000\nOh no, now he's all body conscious.\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.360\nLater at the dance contest.\n\n01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.160\nAll right, everybody, it's the big dance contest.\n\n01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.640\nYou know the rules, best dancer wins,\n\n01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:59.560\neverybody else dies.\n\n01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:04.560\nOh, shit, I broke my leg earlier.\n\n01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:10.600\nDancing doesn't require legs, it requires a spirit.\n\n01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:16.720\nOw, you're doing it, buddy, you're doing it.\n\n01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:23.840\nOw, oh my God, Brenda, look at Buddy dancing with that goonie.\n\n01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.840\nThey're amazing.\n\n01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.520\nI'm a fat piece of shit.\n\n01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:34.680\nOw, I don't know how long I have to dance for.\n\n01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.240\nThe rules were unspecified.\n\n01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.480\nDon't worry about the rules.\n\n01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.560\nOw, just dance.\n\n01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.680\nWhatever happens, happens.\n\n01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:48.000\nDouglas, how did you get out of the dancing competition?\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nWork.\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:59.800\nI declare a winner.\n\n01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.400\nTwo winners, to be exact.\n\n01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.680\nBut as you know, the rules can only be one winner.\n\n01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.560\nEveryone else dies.\n\n01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:18.200\nIt's a dance off between the goonie and Buddy.\n\n01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.720\nWho goes first?\n\n01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.120\nBuddy.\n\n01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.920\nFuck.\n\n01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.720\nIt's okay, buddy, just set the table.\n\n01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.480\nJust set the table and there's nothing you can do\n\n01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.840\nonce you set the table.\n\n01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:39.640\nDouglas, that's a great idea.\n\n01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:49.480\nClank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank,\n\n01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.480\nclank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank.\n\n01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.480\nForks go on the left side.\n\n01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:54.080\nYou can remember that because it's four letters in fork and on left.\n\n01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:57.680\nSpoons go on the right, knives go on the right.\n\n01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:01.360\nHe's doing it perfect and he's never been at a restaurant.\n\n01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.360\nWhat is he doing?\n\n01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.720\nHe's setting the table.\n\n01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:07.200\nWhatever he's doing, he's doing it good.\n\n01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.720\nOh no, Claudia's black man.\n\n01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.480\nI'm out of here.\n\n01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:19.480\nI've been noted as a trope.\n\n01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.480\nI set the table, Douglas.\n\n01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.480\nI set the table.\n\n01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.880\nI felt like I participated in some way.\n\n01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.000\nYou were there the whole time with my fucking heart.\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.320\nAll right, cats and kitty, you just saw a buddy set the table.\n\n01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.320\nNow it's time for the final course.\n\n01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:40.000\nWe got the goonies.\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.400\nEat shit and die.\n\n01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:47.600\nI told you not to feed me.\n\n01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:52.280\nHoly shit, he's eating from the table that got set by body.\n\n01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.080\nI've never seen anything like it.\n\n01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.120\nAnd I put shit on the plates.\n\n01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:58.120\nHe's literally eating shit.\n\n01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.520\nI wonder if he'll die.\n\n01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.820\nWa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa.\n\n01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:07.600\nOh, sunlight, CG.\n\n01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:12.720\nA crucifix logo.\n\n01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.800\nThe Lamb

01:29:31.480\nFor he who shall not let him in the door shall need for nothing.\n\n01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:45.720\nI am Tetsuo.\n\n01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.320\nI think we have a winner, everybody.\n\n01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.800\nThe winner is the goonie.\n\n01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.240\nOh, man.\n\n01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.240\nI can't believe that Goonie-\n\n01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.240\nThat's right.\n\n01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.240\nThat's right.\n\n01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.240\nThe winner.\n\n01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:56.240\nYou all thought I couldn't do it.\n\n01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.240\nAnd I did it.\n\n01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:58.240\nWhere's the trophy?\n\n01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.240\nYou're all fucking dead.\n\n01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.240\nGive it to me.\n\n01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.240\nGive me the trophy.\n\n01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.240\nHere's your trophy, goonie.\n\n01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:07.240\nThere's one thing you might want to think about.\n\n01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:12.720\nBruce Willis, what are you doing here?\n\n01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:16.840\nMaking trophies out of silver.\n\n01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.840\nGoonies hate silver.\n\n01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:32.720\nYeah, buddy, make him deep throat the trophy.\n\n01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:36.400\nYeah.\n\n01:30:36.400 -->

that you use it, come and it goes, it's a new way that you use it.\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nWow.\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nWow.\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000\nThat's a good movie.\n\n01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:08.320\nAnd that was on Broadway, and that was one scene, and we were just reading it.\n\n01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:09.320\nThat's great.\n\n01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.320\nI'm going to go see that.\n\n01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.840\nThe thrill, the thrill of live theater, you know?\n\n01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:13.840\nWhat a rush.\n\n01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:15.480\nMan, oh man.\n\n01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.840\nThey say it's dead.\n\n01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.520\nNo one's more bummed out than Piven.\n\n01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.520\nNo friggin' Tonys.\n\n01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:23.200\nZero Tony nominations.\n\n01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:28.040\nNot a single person that votes for the Tonys came to see it, it slapped in the face.\n\n01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.400\nIt's a rigged system, the Tonys.\n\n01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:36.000\nWe did use a Tony Tony Tony song in it, so that was kind of, we did get three times.\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nIt feels good.\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nThat's the one.\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nYeah.\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nThat was it.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.080\nWhat happened to Tony Tony Tony?\n\n01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.080\nThis little, this little doing show?\n\n01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.080\nNo, Cersei.\n\n01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.080\nI don't know.\n\n01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:53.200\nWell, you know how early silent movie stars were, like the talkies came, and if they had\n\n01:31:53.200 --> 01:32:00.160\nspeech impediments, they didn't make the translation, Tony Tony Tony clearly not a search bar, iTunes\n\n01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.960\ncompatible band.\n\n01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.720\nWhat spelling of Tony are you going to type in first?\n\n01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.720\nYou don't know.\n\n01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.360\nYou're going to type in T-O-N, and hope it comes up in the fucking list.\n\n01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:14.840\nWhat you should do is change it into three different versions of Tony, if each Tony\n\n01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.840\nwas a different version.\n\n01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:17.840\nThat's why they're...\n\n01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.840\nRight there.\n\n01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:19.840\nYeah.\n\n01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:20.840\nIsn't one of them Raphael Siddiq?\n\n01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:25.920\nI think one of those guys might be, that doesn't go on and have a very nice solo career,\n\n01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:26.920\nI think.\n\n01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:27.920\nWhat happened to...\n\n01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.480\nAlso, you got your Bell Biff DeVos.\n\n01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.040\nWhat happened to the Bells and the Biffs?\n\n01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.040\nSpending money, man.\n\n01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.640\nThey made a lot of money there to spend it.\n\n01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:37.800\nWas Top 40 music, I guess that was Top 40 music, it was like playing during the dances\n\n01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:43.560\nwhere I go to school, I'm like, I suddenly was all, it was all about sex, like I'm not\n\n01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:51.200\nsaying, I mean, obviously as the future continues, the music, it gets more and more sexual.\n\n01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:56.080\nBut it seemed like back then, it was like, I'm remembering when I was 16 to 18, it seemed\n\n01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:02.360\nlike every song on the radio was just about, it was only just, it was just like, all that,\n\n01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:07.760\nlike that song was like, if the rhythm feels good to the baby, let me hear you, ah, baby.\n\n01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:10.480\nIt was like an orgasm used as an instrument.\n\n01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:15.920\nAnd then that poison song, it was like, yeah, it was like everything was doom-y and sweating.\n\n01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.840\nThat's what happens when bodies start slapping.\n\n01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:28.520\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna sex you up, girl, I'll make you feel my death,\n\n01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:39.000\nerecting gorge with all my blood, insert it into the corresponding hole, that's how babies\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.200\nget made.\n\n01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.200\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.080\nThere's a lot of safe sex songs too.\n\n01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.680\nIt's weird because at that time, sex was, was a very dangerous thing.\n\n01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:52.200\nYep, it was dangerous as it was ever gonna get, and it was like, we don't have to take\n\n01:33:52.200 --> 01:34:00.200\na close-off, close-off, close-off, close-off, close-off, close-off, close-off, close-off.\n\n01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:03.880\nThat was me, that was me acting like I know how to harmonize, no, but I mean, what was\n\n01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:07.840\nthat, I never said a real song, we don't have to take a close-off, close-off, close-off,\n\n01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.480\nclose-off, close-off, close-off.\n\n01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.360\nI don't remember that one!\n\n01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:21.400\nWe could just play a board game, meet your parents, and be a tribe.\n\n01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.760\nIt's all about over-the-pants hand job.\n\n01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.060\ndoing the running man?\n\n01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:29.560\nthe best kind, because you never have to find out what's inside.\n\n01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.560\nJason, how many minutes front to back do you think you spent on camera, on SNL,ICO\n\n01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:34.980\nJason, how many minutes front to back do you think you spent on camera, on SNL, doing\n\n01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:35.980\nthe Running Man?\n\n01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:43.740\nI bet if you add it up together, it's going to seem like a lot more just in perception,\n\n01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:46.540\nbut I bet it's probably 12 minutes, and it was exhausting.\n\n01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:50.420\nBecause I have a real bone to pick with this

this is my chance to learn the Macarena without any concern about anything.\n\n01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:20.460\nIf anything, I'm like, ah, no matter how awkward I am, I'm still like Jamie Lee Curtis

going on here?\n\n01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:03.700\nStop fucking Jeffrey Kim.\n\n01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:06.700\nGet that out of Jeffrey Kim right now.\n\n01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:09.700\nAnd put it in these.\n\n01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:13.700\nSo Jeffrey Kim starts fucking the teacher.\n\n01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:16.700\nIt was fucking, it was way out of hand, man.\n\n01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:18.700\nThat was the 70s, man.\n\n01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:19.700\nIt was the 70s.\n\n01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.700\nMy principal's name was Mr. Fromgan.\n\n01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:27.700\nAnd I'm okay using that name because I would love to go to court\n\n01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:30.700\nand talk about what an asshole he was.\n\n01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:33.700\nAnd he would, he loved drills.\n\n01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:37.700\nHe loved, like, like, yeah, like, well, no, no, not power jokes.\n\n01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:41.700\nLike, he had a, he had a hand crank siren,\n\n01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:42.700\nbut it was supposed to be mounted.\n\n01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:43.700\nIt had screw holes on it.\n\n01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.700\nYou could see it was supposed to be mounted on a counter,\n\n01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.700\nbut he would, he would walk around going.\n\n01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:53.700\nWhy would he make the noise if he had the drill?\n\n01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:58.700\nThat's like having a cow and going.\n\n01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:00.700\nThe sound that comes out of the thing is so great, too.\n\n01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:01.700\nIt's a waste.\n\n01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:04.700\nBut there were tornado drills, fire drills, tornado drills.\n\n01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:06.700\nAnd there were bomb drills.\n\n01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:10.700\nAnd bomb drills were funny back then because bomb drills meant\n\n01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:13.700\nyou should grow a Mohawk because World War III is happening.\n\n01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:16.700\nLike, the Russians have launched 47,000 missiles.\n\n01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:19.700\nAt Brown Deer, Wisconsin.\n\n01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:22.700\nGotta take out that Brown Deer, Wisconsin.\n\n01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:24.700\nNow it's come full circle where bomb drill means,\n\n01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:26.700\nholy shit, a kid brought a fucking bomb to school.\n\n01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:28.700\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:29.700\nIt's not funny at all.\n\n01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:32.700\nThat, the hashtag, the running man, I'm telling you.\n\n01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:33.700\nOh well.\n\n01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:36.700\nBut he would also, he would take us into the unfinished area\n\n01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:38.700\nor basement of the school and explain to us.\n\n01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:39.700\nTurn off the lights.\n\n01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:42.700\nLike, whether or not we had survived the tornado or fire\n\n01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:43.700\nor bomb in question.\n\n01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:46.700\nBut I remember the beginnings of the drills would be like\n\n01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.700\nline up boy girl, boy girl, like, like,\n\n01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:49.700\nThat seems silly.\n\n01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:50.700\nLike the gender.\n\n01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:52.700\nThese will be your mates.\n\n01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:53.700\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.700\nTheir job is to repopulate the planet.\n\n01:46:56.700 --> 01:47:00.700\nSperm providers and patty cake makers.\n\n01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:02.700\nWill be the foundation of our new society.\n\n01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:06.700\nTornadoes are repelled by glass ceilings.\n\n01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:09.700\nBombs bounce off of them.\n\n01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:15.700\nGender dichotomy will be our new weapon against the mutants.\n\n01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:18.700\nWe had to, we were like two blocks away from our neighborhoods,\n\n01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:23.700\ntornado siren in Kansas and it was frightening.\n\n01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:26.700\nThe screen, the sky had turned like green, like legit green.\n\n01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:28.700\nAnd it would be the stillness.\n\n01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:30.700\nAnd then the siren would start and we'd go look at the window.\n\n01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:33.700\nAnd you mean my younger sisters would be like, oh God.\n\n01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:35.700\nAnd then we'd have to go down, run down the basement.\n\n01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:36.700\nYou lived in tornado world.\n\n01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:37.700\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:39.700\nIt was like, like the fucking movie that showed on once a year\n\n01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:42.700\nthat like where tornadoes were famous in Kansas.\n\n01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:43.700\nWhen tornadoes were famous.\n\n01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:44.700\nYo.\n\n01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:47.700\nBefore Twist, before Twist got it.\n\n01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:49.700\nTwist just snatched it from us for a little while.\n\n01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:51.700\nWhen tornadoes were famous, you're like Archie Bunker.\n\n01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:54.700\nHad cheese eatin' at his colored people to get all the headlines.\n\n01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:58.700\nRemember when tornadoes were famous?\n\n01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:02.700\nAll you had to do was know a few steps to rip up a trailer.\n\n01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:04.700\nThat was talent.\n\n01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:10.700\nNow this Sammy Davis, this Nat King Cole.\n\n01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:12.700\nDid you ever see like an actual tornado, like a twister?\n\n01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:13.700\nNo, never.\n\n01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:14.700\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:18.700\nWere you sad when that mean old lady took her little dog from you?\n\n01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:21.700\nNo, because my sisters wanted the dog.\n\n01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:22.700\nI was a little bit more.\n\n01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:25.700\nAlso, I believe you got to ride the horse in the direction it was facing.\n\n01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:32.700\nI have a very faint childhood memory because my great grandpa was from Oklahoma.\n\n01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:33.700\nRight near you.\n\n01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:34.700\nSure, yes.\n\n01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:35.700\nI mean.\n\n01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:36.700\nIn tornado world.\n\n01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:37.700\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:42.700\nAnd I was like, I have a very, very like remote childhood memory of like,\n\n01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:46.700\nyou know how when you're a kid you pretend to be asleep to get the free ride to the car?\n\n01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:49.700\nLike you just figured that out.\n\n01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.700\nI wonder if parents know that.\n\n01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:55.700\nLike 85% of the time a sleeping child is just faking it.\n\n01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:57.700\nDo we ever call them on it?\n\n01:48:57.700 --> 01:49:00.700\nBut I guess that's like sleep shaming and you don't want to do that either.\n\n01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:02.700\nBecause part of it you would listen and you would be like,\n\n01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:06.700\nI remember I would do that at Grandma's house and they go,\n\n01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:07.700\nis he really sleeping?\n\n01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:08.700\nIs he faking it?\n\n01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:11.700\nAnd I'd be like, fuck you, bitch.\n\n01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:13.700\nYou'd think that or say that?\n\n01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:15.700\nI would think they would say it.\n\n01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:18.700\nI'm not a Roger Rabbit character.\n\n01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:20.700\nI didn't have that word power yet.\n\n01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:21.700\nYeah.\n\n01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:23.700\nI was like, I would have been a Goo Goo Gaga.\n\n01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:27.700\nBut I was like, I was like, don't you dare like Aunt Susie.\n\n01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:30.700\nDon't you dare like sleep shame me.\n\n01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:31.700\nI could be asleep.\n\n01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:33.700\nThat's what's important.\n\n01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:35.700\nAll you're doing half the time I'm awake.\n\n01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:37.700\nYou're hoping I fall asleep.\n\n01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:41.700\nI was like, yeah, you're always complaining about my energy level.\n\n01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.700\nI lay down in a sleeping bag and you tell me that I look cute.\n\n01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:45.700\nWhat do you think I'm going to keep doing?\n\n01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:47.700\nAnything that provides comfort is a potential addiction.\n\n01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:49.700\nYeah.\n\n01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:50.700\nJust roll with it.\n\n01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:51.700\nGet me in the car.\n\n01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.700\nGet me home and shut the fuck up.\n\n01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:59.700\nI'm the sack of potatoes you always hoped I'd be.\n\n01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:02.700\nSo much anger, the angry little child.\n\n01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:04.700\nThey poured it into me like a sponge.\n\n01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:06.700\nThey're anger, not mine.\n\n01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:07.700\nYours.\n\n01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:12.700\nAll of yours.\n\n01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:15.700\nSo I have this memory of being carried.\n\n01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:22.700\nI was pretensly sleeping and my dad carried me through what seemed like a tornado.\n\n01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:29.700\nWe went to the tornado seller every place in the lower Midwest has a tornado seller.\n\n01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:32.700\nIt's not like a special thing like bomb shelters.\n\n01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:35.700\nIt's like everybody has a tornado seller.\n\n01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:37.700\nWe just had a basement.\n\n01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:40.700\nThe basement was underground, like legit.\n\n01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:44.700\nI don't mean to brag, I don't mean to brag, but yeah, it was fully underground.\n\n01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:49.700\nWe used to hide under the pool table.\n\n01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:51.700\nYeah, you got to make that's a good way.\n\n01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:54.700\nWhat do you guys think about that earthquake thing when they go like hide under a thing?\n\n01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:57.700\nIsn't that just to create a pocket of air so you die slowly?\n\n01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:00.700\nYou're supposed to find a triangle, right?\n\n01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:06.700\nYou're supposed to find something that won't immediately break by the initial impact of everything above you,\n\n01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:10.700\nbut that just means that you'll take days to die.\n\n01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:12.700\nYeah, I mean...\n\n01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:17.700\nBecause either something's falling, either you're aware things are falling that much on top of you,\n\n01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:21.700\nin which case you're either dead right away or dead in three days.\n\n01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:23.700\nThis is my opinion, I hope I'm wrong.\n\n01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:29.700\nBut when they say like find a doorway, there's been that cynical joke of that's where they look to find you.\n\n01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:32.700\nBut I think that there's a truth to that where they're saying like,\n\n01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:38.700\nwell, there's air pockets, structural air pockets, and that's where people have been for like three days.\n\n01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:41.700\nI'm somewhat claustrophobic.\n\n01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:46.700\nYeah, but that might be a first world problem that the second you're sort of underneath a bunch of rubble,\n\n01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:50.700\nyou'll be like, oh, this is a lot worse than not.\n\n01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:52.700\nThey're like not existing.\n\n01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:55.700\nIn the third world, they're like, actually, at least my boss isn't whipping me.\n\n01:51:55.700 --> 01:52:00.700\nIn the third world, it's like the earth's shaking, this could all turn out better than it was.\n\n01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:03.700\nThey're like snow day.\n\n01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:04.700\nI would only assume.\n\n01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:10.700\nWhen we were kids, when it was snow and we couldn't go to school, we'd run out and dig holes in the snow and stay in it.\n\n01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:16.700\nIt's so funny, the rest of the world is so poor.\n\n01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:20.700\nWhen I was a kid here, I don't know if it happened anymore,\n\n01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:23.700\nbut when I was a kid, there were smog days where the air quality was so bad,\n\n01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:27.700\nyou couldn't go outside and have recess because you would get like a burning, painful chest.\n\n01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:29.700\nIt was really, really bad.\n\n01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:31.700\nYou couldn't go to basketball practice or anything.\n\n01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:35.700\nYou had to stay inside and not ever go outside because the smog was so bad.\n\n01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:39.700\nThen they took the lead out of the gasoline and I think that stopped.\n\n01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:41.700\nThat's a lie.\n\n01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:42.700\nThat's a huge lie.\n\n01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:44.700\nThat's very, very a huge lie.\n\n01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:46.700\nYou know Sammy Snopes?\n\n01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:48.700\nI'm Sammy Snopes.\n\n01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:49.700\nThat's a huge lie.\n\n01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:52.700\nI love Hitler and I'm orange.\n\n01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:54.700\nI'm Sammy Snopes.\n\n01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:56.700\nYou didn't Trump or what?\n\n01:52:56.700 --> 01:52:59.700\nI was trying to do Trump, but I don't have a Trump.\n\n01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:01.700\nYou've got to start with your fire.\n\n01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.700\nThat's like your fire.\n\n01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:04.700\nYou're fired.\n\n01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:06.700\nYou're fired?\n\n01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:08.700\nYou've got to say like, you're fired.\n\n01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:09.700\nYou're fired.\n\n01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:10.700\nYou're fired.\n\n01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:11.700\nYou're fired.\n\n01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:12.700\nI'm Vinnie Bobby.\n\n01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:14.700\nSammy Snopes because I started with your fire.\n\n01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:16.700\nYou're fired.\n\n01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:21.700\nAutomatically everyone is agreeing that this is a fantastic Trump impersonation.\n\n01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:22.700\nYou're fired.\n\n01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:23.700\nYou're fired.\n\n01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:28.700\nI just shot with Dana Carvey and he has an amazing Trump force.\n\n01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:32.700\nHe has these, his impressions are always like that amazing.\n\n01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:33.700\nWhat does it sound like?\n\n01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:39.700\nWell, I can't, but as with his impressions, if you hear them, then everyone will be doing Trump perfectly.\n\n01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:43.700\nWill and Jason, do you know that Dan does a really good Iced Tea impression?\n\n01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:45.700\nNo, does he?\n\n01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:46.700\nYeah.\n\n01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:52.700\nIt's pretty good.\n\n01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:54.700\nDo you want to beat or do you want to just do it yourself?\n\n01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:56.700\nNo, just give me a topic.\n\n01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:57.700\nI'll talk about...\n\n01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:58.700\nRain shoes.\n\n01:53:58.700 --> 01:53:59.700\nRain shoes.\n\n01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:01.700\nRain shoes?\n\n01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:03.700\nLike rain boots?\n\n01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:05.700\nRain shoes.\n\n01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:06.700\nYeah.\n\n01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:07.700\nRain shoes.\n\n01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:09.700\nListen, man.\n\n01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:14.700\nEverything you've been wearing on your feet, shit.\n\n01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:20.700\nThat ain't shit.\n\n01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:24.700\nNew rain shoes, it ain't personal.\n\n01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:26.700\nIt's business.\n\n01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:29.700\nI kind of lost my momentum.\n\n01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:30.700\nNo, that was it.\n\n01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:34.700\nIt's not polite to make people...\n\n01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:36.700\nThe back loved it.\n\n01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:40.700\nThey're like, oh, shit, another guest.\n\n01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:44.700\nYeah, they don't know that.\n\n01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:47.700\nIced tea's here.\n\n01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:49.700\nShut the fuck up, Iced tea's here.\n\n01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:51.700\nListen.\n\n01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:58.700\nDan and Rob, what a lot of people don't know is that Jason Sudeikis does one of the greatest rosy pares impressions as you've ever heard.\n\n01:54:58.700 --> 01:54:59.700\nBilly!\n\n01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:01.700\nOh, Billy.\n\n01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:03.700\nWhat is a quince?\n\n01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:05.700\nShe lives right near us in Brooklyn.\n\n01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:06.700\nWhat?\n\n01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:07.700\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:08.700\nRosie Perez lives right near us.\n\n01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:10.700\nI just watched the white man can jump recently.\n\n01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:11.700\nDelightful movie.\n\n01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:12.700\nIt's a good movie.\n\n01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:13.700\nAn independent movie.\n\n01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:14.700\nThis is really like his comparison.\n\n01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:15.700\nNo, not at all.\n\n01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:16.700\nIt's a big old studio movie.\n\n01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:17.700\nI love it.\n\n01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:18.700\nBut when you watch it, you're just like, oh my god, this is...\n\n01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:22.700\nThe outfit that Wesley Snipes wears while playing basketball is one of the most hilarious things.\n\n01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:24.700\nNo one's ever played sports wearing a painter's hat.\n\n01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:27.700\nHe's like a gay Italian bicyclist.\n\n01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:30.700\nWell, no, that's what Wesley Snipes dressed like that.\n\n01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:37.700\nWesley Snipes outfit is just as ridiculous because he's got the bicycle hat flipped up and a very deep cut tank top.\n\n01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:39.700\nWere you saying Wesley or Woody?\n\n01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:40.700\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.700\nWoody Harrelson's outfit's pretty nuts too.\n\n01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:42.700\nIt's awesome.\n\n01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:43.700\nThe 80s is really good.\n\n01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:44.700\n90s, 80s.\n\n01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:45.700\n90s, I think.\n\n01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:46.700\nOr 89, maybe 91.\n\n01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:47.700\n90, 91?\n\n01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:48.700\nYeah.\n\n01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:51.700\nAnyway, we saw her at a restaurant right when we first moved to the hood and she goes,\n\n01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:52.700\noh, you guys live here?\n\n01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:53.700\nOh, no.\n\n01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:54.700\nWhat?\n\n01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:57.700\nHere comes the neighborhood.\n\n01:55:57.700 --> 01:56:00.700\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:03.700\nOh, live here well, live here fine.\n\n01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:04.700\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:05.700\nOh, great.\n\n01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:07.700\nI kind of took it...\n\n01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:08.700\nI wear it with a badge of honor.\n\n01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:09.700\nI like that.\n\n01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:10.700\nI'd say, yeah, I guess so, yeah.\n\n01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:11.700\nThat's so amazing.\n\n01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:12.700\nShe wasn't like...\n\n01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:13.700\nMaybe she wasn't...\n\n01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:14.700\nNot kidding.\n\n01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:18.700\nGolly.\n\n01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:20.700\nThis dummy thought she was a joke.\n\n01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:21.700\nMaybe it wasn't as I'm saying it now.\n\n01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:26.700\nIs it okay to talk about what your wife is doing while she's here?\n\n01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:27.700\nYeah, I think so.\n\n01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:29.700\nShe's just fucking a bunch of dudes, right?\n\n01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:30.700\nYeah.\n\n01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:31.700\nThat's fine.\n\n01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:32.700\nYou're fine with that, right?\n\n01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:33.700\nIs this called cuckold fetish?\n\n01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:34.700\nWhat's it called?\n\n01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:35.700\nWell, it's not a fetish.\n\n01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:36.700\nI mean, I have no...\n\n01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:37.700\nYou don't like it.\n\n01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:38.700\nIt doesn't turn me on.\n\n01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:39.700\nNo.\n\n01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:40.700\nBut I don't hate it.\n\n01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:41.700\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:42.700\nIt's like...\n\n01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:45.700\nShe's the breadwinner and it's going to be how it's going to be.\n\n01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:46.700\nYeah, but she's not.\n\n01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:47.700\nIt's like...\n\n01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:51.700\nShe acquires nothing except for potentially diseases.\n\n01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:52.700\nRight.\n\n01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:54.700\nWho knows what memories that I'll...\n\n01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:55.700\nYou try to be encouraging.\n\n01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:56.700\nYou're just saying...\n\n01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:59.700\nYeah, I'm like, all right, have fun.\n\n01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:00.700\nWhat do you say?\n\n01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:01.700\nYou're just kind of like, I get it.\n\n01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:04.700\nAnd at the same time, you're like, I wish this wasn't the way.\n\n01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:07.700\nBut then I'm also like, you know what?\n\n01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:11.700\nWe only get one shot on this marble, you know?\n\n01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:13.700\nFor better or for worse.\n\n01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:15.700\nFor better or for worse.\n\n01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:16.700\nI ride that horse.\n\n01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:17.700\nThe cuckold's mantra.\n\n01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:18.700\nYeah.\n\n01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:21.700\nWe only get one shot on this marble.\n\n01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:25.700\nNo, no, that's not word play.\n\n01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:26.700\nYou guys are...\n\n01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:27.700\nOh, that's a terrible...\n\n01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:28.700\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:29.700\nI just touched my...\n\n01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:30.700\nI touched it by accident.\n\n01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:31.700\nThere was a mystery.\n\n01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:34.700\nYeah, that's how it started.\n\n01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:35.700\nOh!\n\n01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:37.700\nI was like...\n\n01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:40.700\nAnd I was, of course, I was like, yeah, well, okay.\n\n01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:41.700\nAs long as it...\n\n01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:45.700\nThat's why I have this podium is I've been touching it by accident during the entire show.\n\n01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:48.700\nIs she doing a music video or something?\n\n01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:50.700\nYeah, she's directing a music video for the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\n01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:51.700\nOkay.\n\n01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:52.700\nYeah.\n\n01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:56.700\nShe's had phone calls with Flea and she's just like, oh my God, if like the 15 year old\n\n01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:59.700\nme, like, you know, it's one of those nuts moments for her.\n\n01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:00.700\nIt's her second one.\n\n01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:02.700\nShe directed an Edward Sharp video and then this is her second one.\n\n01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:03.700\nYeah, that doesn't...\n\n01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:08.700\nShe doesn't need anything plugged, but I think it's worth promoting Olivia Wilde's director\n\n01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:09.700\nand producer.\n\n01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:10.700\n100%.\n\n01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:11.700\nNo, it's one of the...\n\n01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:15.700\nI mean, it's one of the most amazing things about, you know, being with her is like being\n\n01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:16.700\nable to brag about her.\n\n01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:17.700\nBut this one is such a cool one.\n\n01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:21.700\nI told, I tell everybody, it's more fun to brag about your partner than it is yourself,\n\n01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:22.700\nat least for me.\n\n01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:23.700\nIt's like...\n\n01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:27.700\nBut he gets in some brags of his own...\n\n01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.700\nHe showed us the Nike closet.\n\n01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:30.700\nYeah, I watched it.\n\n01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:31.700\nHe didn't walk past it.\n\n01:58:31.700 --> 01:58:32.700\nNo, no.\n\n01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:34.700\nHe was like, by the way, here's every shoe name by Nike.\n\n01:58:34.700 --> 01:58:36.700\nBut I didn't know as I was going to do it.\n\n01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:40.700\nI was like, well, these guys aren't a safe space, but here we go.\n\n01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:42.700\nI'll hear about this.\n\n01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:44.700\nThis will be podcast.\n\n01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:45.700\nIt's like, this is me.\n\n01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:46.700\nOh, well.\n\n01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:47.700\nThis is the record.\n\n01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:48.700\nIt's the size of an elevator.\n\n01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:49.700\nYour house is crazy.\n\n01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:51.700\nHe has an arcade down in the basement.\n\n01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:56.700\nIt's the size of an elevator, and it's on the fourth story of the first four-story\n\n01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:58.700\nhouse I've ever been in in my life.\n\n01:58:58.700 --> 01:58:59.700\nSecond floor.\n\n01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:02.700\nAll right, but there were two above us when I...\n\n01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:03.700\nYeah.\n\n01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:05.700\nI've never been on that many...\n\n01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:10.700\nI've never been on that many floors of a building when I wasn't being yelled at by somebody,\n\n01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:12.700\nor being turned down for a job.\n\n01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:13.700\nSame, same.\n\n01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:17.700\nI was in a person's home, and I was on a fourth floor at one point.\n\n01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:18.700\nIt's not lost in me.\n\n01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:19.700\nI didn't pay for the whole thing.\n\n01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:20.700\nIt's a 50-50 endeavor.\n\n01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:24.700\nWe're hoping our little guy does something interesting and pays us back.\n\n01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:28.700\nWhen you were doing the Gary Marshall movie, you're saying, like, I'm only doing this to\n\n01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:29.700\npay for the rugs.\n\n01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:33.700\nI'm like, how many rugs?\n\n01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:35.700\nThere's a lot of...\n\n01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:38.700\nYeah, there's a lot of rugs when you have a house.\n\n01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:40.700\nAnd four-storys, it's a lot of bare floor.\n\n01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:41.700\nAnd I didn't know rugs.\n\n01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:42.700\nI didn't know...\n\n01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:43.700\nBut you get a kid.\n\n01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:46.700\nFour-storys plus bare floor equals a two-year-old...\n\n01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:48.700\nThat's like a disaster.\n\n01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:50.700\nSliding and stairs.\n\n01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:51.700\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:52.700\nYou need rugs for that kid.\n\n01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:53.700\nYou gotta have rugs.\n\n01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:54.700\nYou need friction.\n\n01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:55.700\nAnd rugs are super pricey.\n\n01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:56.700\nRugs are super pricey.\n\n01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:57.700\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:59:57.700 --> 01:59:58.700\nWhat kind of rugs you get?\n\n01:59:58.700 --> 01:59:59.700\nYou get some nice Persian rugs?\n\n01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:00.700\nWhat do you got?\n\n02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:01.700\nI don't think there's any Persian in there.\n\n02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:04.700\nIt's like ABC, you know, like carpet.\n\n02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:05.700\nIs it what?\n\n02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:07.700\nThere's a carpet place called ABC carpet.\n\n02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:08.700\nI thought it was like...\n\n02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:11.700\nThey were kids' rugs, like they had ABCs on them.\n\n02:00:11.700 --> 02:00:12.700\nNo.\n\n02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:13.700\nNo, we're just...\n\n02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:14.700\nNo.\n\n02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:15.700\nNo, we don't...\n\n02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:16.700\nWe had...\n\n02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:20.700\nSomeone sent us a nice little, like, throw rug that was all the states, but we...\n\n02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:22.700\nI think we donated it to a local grade school.\n\n02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:24.700\nDid you hear that, Maya Rudolph?\n\n02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:25.700\nYeah.\n\n02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:26.700\nCould have given it to you.\n\n02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:28.700\nYour fucking rug sucked.\n\n02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:30.700\nIt's the thought that counts.\n\n02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:31.700\nOh, God.\n\n02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:33.700\nI don't think she sent it to us.\n\n02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:34.700\nShe bought it.\n\n02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:37.700\nForte, do you have kids' family?\n\n02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:38.700\nI don't.\n\n02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:40.700\nI have nothing, none of that.\n\n02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:43.700\nSo just by choice or just because you're...\n\n02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:45.700\nI'm very late on this thing.\n\n02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:48.700\nI want to do it at some point.\n\n02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:53.700\nYou mean like you want to have sex at some point?\n\n02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:56.700\nJeff, I have sex.\n\n02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:57.700\nWoo!\n\n02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:58.700\nThat was like...\n\n02:00:58.700 --> 02:00:59.700\nProve it.\n\n02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:00.700\nOh!\n\n02:01:00.700
