00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
There's a song by our friend Titanic's and Claire who always makes amazing stuff.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Look up Titanic online.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
From Harmontown.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Where?

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
From Harmontown.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
We're in Harmontown.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
In Hollywood, California.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Welcome once again Harmontown is now in session.

00:22.000 --> 00:31.000
Music.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
So many friends.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Spencer Crittenden everybody.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
Spencer.

00:44.000 --> 00:57.000
From.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
That's our show. Good night.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Thanks for coming.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm the mayor of Harmontown.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
This is Dan Harmon.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Thank you.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Thank you.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
What a show. What a show we had.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
What a show.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
We got so much planned for you tonight.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Brought to you by Dr. Pepper.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Alright I came up with a bit. I have a bit.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Here comes the bit.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
I have a real bit. Do you have a segment music for a real bit I have?

01:33.000 --> 01:48.000
Music.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Okay so you know how everybody thinks professional wrestling is fake?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Right.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Okay.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yes.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Right.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
I decided last night I'm already messing up the bit.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
That I think all other wrestling is fake.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
Because you can't tell me that for 6,000 years teams of people have been getting together

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
and dressing the same and trying to pin each other on a mat.

02:17.000 --> 02:26.000
Nobody thought to bring a snake or a 2x4.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
14 more years of that and I'd have like a strong 10 minutes.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Thank you.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
But in the meantime back to the regular show which is nothing.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
You're like 59 minutes short of a full HBO comedy special.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Is the microphone supposed to be back further?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Don't you guys like it when it's back further?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I liked it better.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
Not talking to you.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Okay.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Thank you for the mushrooms last night.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
So Dan and I and Cody we did mushrooms and we went to a fancy restaurant.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Which is a terrible idea.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I didn't know we were going to have dinner.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Jeff in the car.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
What did you think you were going to do at the restaurant?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Exercise?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
We were going to a restaurant.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Jeff in the car on the way to the Bel Air Hotel.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
You should take them now because they take an hour to kick in.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
And then I think we, I don't know when we took them but exactly an hour after we took them

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
we were at a MatriD station.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I didn't know we were having a fancy dinner.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
In a restaurant where everybody was like that better be Peter Jackson.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
Because otherwise it's homeless hodor.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
It's the other thing.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I was just dressed while I was wearing these clothes.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
And Jeff was wearing a suit that was like when we ordered the food and then it came

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
and it looked like Beetlejuice.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
My appetizer was terrifying.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
It looked like my salad was like talking to me and it was wild.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
And you don't want to eat.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
I remember in my memory what you ordered looked like an Indian headdress.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yes it did.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Exactly.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
It was like there were like leaves coming out of different colors.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
What was that movie?

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
The Mayan sacrifice movie, the Mel Gibson produced one.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Apocalypse.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Might meal look like apocalypto.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Apocalypto.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
He ordered the apocalypto.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Sorry I'll face this way too sometimes.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I looked over it.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Cody was laughing like crazy.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Dan look, you look really paranoid.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I was upset.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
And I just said hey you guys why don't you guys take a walk.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
I'll take care of the dinner.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
So I pretended like I was your like handler, like your manager.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Because I had a suit on.

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
And I said Mr. Harmon and Cody they had, they found out they had to leave.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
May I please get their food to go for them and I'll take care of it.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
So I sat there.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
We're like running around in the front.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
I'm a seagull.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
I walked out, I enjoyed my dinner and it was trippy because I was sitting there like when

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
you're on mushrooms you're a little, you're very self aware and you feel like everybody

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
else is also kind of aware of you but maybe they're not at all.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
But now I'm just a dude in a suit with all like three people's food in front of me.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
And I made it out of there alive.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
I had a couple drinks and I tip pretty big on your card so I'll help you like that.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
And I bowed out and the Harmon is sitting out by himself at a fountain.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
And he's got his left hand in the fountain.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
And the water's trickling on his hand.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
And I go over there and you were like the fountain was talking to you.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
I laid my palm on top of the surface of the water.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
And when I dipped it beneath the surface my hand became an ape's hand.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
And if I lowered it it became an alien hand because apes are more sophisticated than aliens.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
And the more primitive the life the more advanced it is because the more primitive the life

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
the more it's able to contact me because it's based on water and water is the conduit.

06:29.000 --> 06:37.000
So as I kept my palm on top, when Jeff came up I had just figured out that if I keep my palm

06:37.000 --> 06:45.000
on the top of the water I can listen to all life.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
And do you know what it said?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
What did it say?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
What did it say?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
What did all life say?

06:50.000 --> 06:58.000
It said, tell our story.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
And I will.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
Life hitched a dragon to the right star that night.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
See your story set in the old west with Andy Dick as the sheriff.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Someone pay me.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
I watched Aliens.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
That's what I did last night.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Steve's got cups.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
We need those.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Thank you Steve.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Steve, leave everybody.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Watch the second half of Aliens.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
That's a good movie.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
It still holds up.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
It's fun.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
The first Aliens.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Oh, it don't.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
What?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
There was only what?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
The second movie in the Alien franchise.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Right.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
And I watched the second half of it.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Right.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Just the second half?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Just the second half.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
My favorite line in that movie is not Game Over Man but in that same conversation.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
Because Bill Pax said that she's like, she knows the way around.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
And he's just like, why don't you put her in charge?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I didn't do it.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
I don't know if you're keeping score.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Which kind of asses kicked back there?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
All the other ones.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
I feel like, well, it's Bill Pax.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
It's sort of like Bill Paxton.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
It's great because in the sense of like, oh, Christopher Walk under Nicholson.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
It's like a caricature of himself.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
But that line, why don't you put her in charge?

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
I kind of also, I was like immediately, I was like, yeah, what the fuck is going on, man?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
We're going to get killed.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
You know what I mean?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
It was good.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
It was also like there was a tunnel to your soul.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Paul Reiser's very good in that.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Paul Reiser's great in him.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
That whole movie is like Slam Dunk.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Slam Dunk.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
That's a slam dunk.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Spencer, have you ever done mushrooms?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Are you a mushroom guy?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Nah, man.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Because you know, here's the thing they say about mushrooms.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
You know what they say?

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
They say, if you think you're going to have a good time, you will.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
And I can't think I'm going to have a good time.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Yeah, I know what you mean.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Like, well, people freak you out by saying, it's like this weird mobius strip of like,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
oh, if you think it's possible to have a bad trip, then you will have a bad trip.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
No, I only think it's possible to have a bad trip.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
And yeah, yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
I understand.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Completely.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Same thing.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
I just took, you know, I wanted my, I didn't want my girlfriend to think I was a pussy.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Filthy fucking hippies.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
But Cody had a bad time.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
We both kind of had overall a bad time.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I mean, I think it was worth it to just communicate with all of life first.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
But I think, I think if you like, she was saying like demons were coming out.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
We only took enough to have kind of a bad ecstasy trip.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Like, it wasn't, it wasn't like, we didn't.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
It's like, like, I think the point of Sila Simon is supposed to be ideally that you,

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
and they're using it to treat post traumatic stress now because another ailments because

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
Sila Simon has a clinically measurable effect of something previously thought to be immeasurable,

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
which is perspective.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Like you actually take enough of it and you, you walk away with the sense that you are

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
part of a larger whole.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
And it's sort of like, they give it to like, you know, people that were in Iraq and got,

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
got blown to bits and, and, and are, and are, you know, having trouble coping with that,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
that stress and shoving it down.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
And they, they experimented with giving them Sila Simon and, and, and they're, so they're

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
finally doing some scientific research into these effects.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
I think if you don't take quite enough to push you through onto Jim Morrison's other side,

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
that you simply are just like super aware of yourself because I got out of the shower

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
and I was just like staring at myself in the mirror.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
And I knew that I was disgusting, but I was also like, I was like, I'm beautiful.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
Like, like, I was like, like Cody after like 20 minutes, he was like, baby, okay.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
And I said, yeah, I'm, I'm an ape.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Like, I just know that I'm an ape.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
And I was like, I was just naked and all of the, the patterns of my body hair and how

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
they were revealing that I had descended from an ape that had gone through a semi aquatic

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
phase. That's right. That's why we're hairless.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
That's, uh, uh, look it up.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Elaine Morgan's aquatic ape theory and it was being proven to me because the scintillating

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
drips of water where go, following this like, you know, this like perfect like pattern.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
And it was just like this, you know, everything moves when you're on mushrooms.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
I was like, my, my, my, my big pink round gut was like pulsating like this like cocoon

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
of full of baby apes.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
And it was just like, and I was just going like this and watching my belly button and

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
my nipples like turn into this mouth going like this, this face going like,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
it says, it says like you had enough.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
I had, I did, but it was all kind of up here.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
It was, it was all about the self.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And I think that, I think that a true mushroom.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
I told you guys to take three.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
You only take two, right?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Kids, if you're doing it, take more.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
And tell, tell the cops I, I said it was a, all right.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
The first time I ever did mushrooms, I was with Jason Sudeikis and a friend of his from

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Second City.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
We were in Vegas and he was doing a show.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Dude, this story is such horseshit.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
I was so sick of you telling the story about you and Jason Sudeikis and his comedy friends

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
like taking mushrooms.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I know it's fucking not true.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
I was in, I was in the bathroom and I heard knock, knock, knock.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
And then Jason Sudeikis is outside saying, hey man, you okay?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Cause we had just taken mushrooms.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
And I was, I was like, yeah, I'm cool.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I'm just talking to the shampoos right now.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
Because the shampoos, he had a bunch of, he and his roommate, they were doing a comedy

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
show at the Flamingo and they were singing at a place near where Tupac got killed, I think.

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
And they had all these stolen hotel shampoos and they were like a little choir of angels

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
singing to me.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
I'm like, I'm cool.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I'm just singing with the shampoos.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
And Jason's like, all right, see you.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
I was trying to, I was trying to tee up like a fancy, like a, like a clever.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I knew what you were doing.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Right.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
I knew what you were doing too.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Who else did you do mushrooms with?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Will Forte?

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Will Forte is one of the biggest fucking pussies in the world.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
He would never do drugs.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
He would never do it.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
If he were here and Jason Sudeikis were here, they would both fucking kick your ass or be

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
mad.

12:55.000 --> 13:23.000
Let's bring out Jason Sudeikis and Will Forte.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Right.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Thank you.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Hey, Will, I'm reception.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I'm sorry about the whole pussy remark thing.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
That's all right.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Okay.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
I feel bad about that.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
He didn't know you were here.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
You look a lot tougher now, Will, with the shaved head thing.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
You looked much more like a, you might kick my ass for real.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Thank you very much.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I appreciate that.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
It's half the battle.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Just looking like it.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Yeah.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Is this the care?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Are you still shooting Last Man on Earth this season's Last Man on Earth?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
No, we finished a couple of months ago.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
So we start writing on Tuesday.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Oh, okay.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Two more.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
So you actually sit in the writer's room like full services, but you can't.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
At a certain point, there's overlap, right?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
You can't, there's overlap.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
So then I, at that point, we do the acting all day, and then I got to write at nights

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
and on weekends.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
That's not true.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Come on.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
No, no.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
I don't mean that to be like, you're lazy.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Literally acting in a scene.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
I'm acting in a scene with them.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
And then it's like, okay, cut.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
We're going to turn around.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I go this way because our chairs and the foods go over this way.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Will goes this way.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
And then there's a laptop open and works on the laptop the whole time.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Because I was like, yeah, I'll do the show.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
It'll be fun to hang out with you and act with you.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
It was like, oh, we only get to pretend to hang out.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
I mean, we got paid, but then you left and then you went to go do his other job.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Literally during the day.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
That's pretty remarkable.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
I work very hard.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I'm a very hard worker.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
It's incredible.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
He really is.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Are you writing?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Are you writing that episode?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Are you writing future episodes?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Are you freestyling?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
He's rewriting episodes that have already aired.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
He's nuts.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
He's nuts.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
But also different shows.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
He's doing two, two, seven episodes.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Improving them, though.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
All of them better.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
Jack has never been sassier.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Is this alcohol?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Yeah.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Where's that coming from?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Oh, do you want to drink that one?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
No, that's all right.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Who's running Last Man on Earth?

15:21.000 --> 15:29.000
Andy, Bob Rowe, and Eric Durbin now is coming in to co-showrun.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Oh, okay.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Because Bob Rowe, you finally figured it out.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
He's a fucking...

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
He's the worst.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
He's not good.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
No, he's fantastic.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I love him so much.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Every...

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
I was talking to Monica Patrick, an old community writer.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
We were at the hotel having brunch, and we were just...

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Everybody's scattered to the 85 wins now.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
There's a community person everywhere, because we did six seasons,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
and I'm sure some of them are like...

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
I'm sure they all hate me, but I'm sure also some of them...

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
I'm nostalgic about just the family of it all.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Each season, it's like, oh, man, season three was great.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
We had so-and-so and such-and-such.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I was looking at the Yahoo season and even thinking...

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I don't know what I'm explaining to you.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
No, just that it's the expanse of it after it all.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
It's the same way at SNL, or even when I watch TV and I bore Olivia with...

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Oh, I did Second City with that guy in that commercial.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
It's like us, I would say, even me, you, and Jeff,

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
we've known each other for 20-plus years, that idea of...

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I guess that's the feeling of family,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
where that's why grandparents are like,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
it'd be nice to hear from you once in a while,

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
because they're like, they only run two shows in their life

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
for like 30 seasons each.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
It's like a mother and a grandmother.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
60 minutes in Japan.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
How did you guys meet the first time then?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
The three of you.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Comedy Sports in Kansas City, actually.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah, because Dan was Milwaukee Comedy Sports,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Jason was Kansas City, I was LA,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
and Rob was obviously a Milwaukee, and we met...

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Obviously.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Just look at me.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Look at how Milwaukee...

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
You weren't at that tournament, I don't think.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Were you at Kansas City?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I don't think I was invited.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
There was a Kansas City tournament.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
You were probably invited.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
I was probably invited.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Everyone's allowed to go.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Everybody's allowed to go.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
But like...

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
You guys became an 80s mattress commercial for a second.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Serda.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Serda.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Springer, Springer.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
A galaxy of savings.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Galaxy of savings.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
But like, Jason, you were in a group with our friend Jeremy Carter,

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
who was in Super Ego.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
We all...

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Not every city, but a lot of the cities in Comedy Sports,

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
when we went to a tournament,

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
there was kind of the younger crew that we all kind of circled

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
around each other and became friends,

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
and we all have remained friends, which is really crazy.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
We all were kind of annoyed at our bosses.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I mean, blessed all their hearts, but like...

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Right.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
But I remember there's always that thing.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Name names.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
James Bailey, Clancy Hathaway, and Dick Chudnow.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Yeah.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Like, I know all their names.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
I remember their names.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
Teenage Anger doesn't go away that quick.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
I'm still making money off of it.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
We went all just like, talk shit about our kind of bosses.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
What kind of shit?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Well, they were just never...

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
They were just never doing anything right in our minds.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah, the bosses.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
We were 22, and we were like, do it.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
We were so funny, and like, oh, so-and-so is it, you know,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
paying us $20 a show doesn't give us gas money,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
and like, doesn't he know how to run a thing?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
And they didn't.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
No, but they were great.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
We wouldn't have all met each other.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
We wouldn't have met the friends.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
I mean, yeah.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
It's tough to be the boss.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
I wouldn't have got on whose line

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
if I didn't do 10 years of short form improv.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Right.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Like, that was a school for that.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
But we all eventually said, fuck this shit,

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
and like, moved on.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
And I'm not an actor,

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
but of course as a writer and producer

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
at ComedySports gave me all my people skills.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
It helps you when you're dealing with the network.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
I would have been a real bad apple in their eyes

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
if I hadn't learned to say yes and every fucking idiot.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
They still don't like me.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
But the, well, I don't know.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
So let's talk about writer-actor hybrids,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
because you're talking about, well, I just don't even,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I mean, I really want to get my head around that

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
because I'm having pings of insane jealousy there

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
with the idea of you being on set,

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
having sold a show, created it, developed it,

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
and now you're on the set

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
and you're still running over to the laptop.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
Like, I've got such a man crush on you for that.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
Like, and just, because I...

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
I told you this would be fun.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
I didn't know that I would meet somebody.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
In a scene that he's describing, are you...

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Is what's on the laptop, like, scenes that are

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
about to shoot that week, or is it, like, a next episode?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
No, we will...

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Every once in a while, you'll get into a case

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
where you're writing stuff for stuff that week,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
but usually it's jamming out the stuff

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
that's coming the following week.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
I mean, ideally, you're to a place where you get this stuff

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
all settled before you're even shooting, because...

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Ideally, yeah.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
But it does not happen all the time.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Every year, it's like the first day of school.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
You're like, here's my math notebook and my trapper keeper

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
and the unicorn's going to hold the pencils

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
and here's my three shirts I'm going to wear

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
and then two days later, it's bubblegum unfolding

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
with the thing and like...

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
I have so many doogie-houser journals, like, either in real writing.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
They're just, like, five strong days

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
and then I forget it and go on a trip

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
and it's like, well, I'll never fuck that.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
But one that was like, it was like a little tiny one like this

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
was like write something for five, you know, like five years.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I got it as a Christmas gift, so New Year's.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
All right, great.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Literally, two days went on a trip and now it's done

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
and it's like I won't even pick up on it

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
because it's like, no, if I can't do the five years straight,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I'm only five months into it.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Six months into it?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I'm like, no, it's dead to me.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Sorry, I blew it.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Squandered potential.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
When you got from...

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I was with you in...

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I was there in Las Vegas the night.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
We happened to be in Las Vegas.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
You were in Second City, Las Vegas.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
You had been bumped up to the minors from comedy sports

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
to like you were doing...

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
There was like 30 people in the audience

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
in this club in Las Vegas.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
And it was a funny improv show

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
but you were kind of beaming

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
and trying to keep your Don Draper vibe, you know,

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
because you're such a hipster.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
But then quickly, we were told that the scout from SNL

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
had been there that week or maybe that day.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Oh, I don't remember. I can't.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
I don't remember the exact timeline.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
But I mean, that's where, yeah, that's where...

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
It was the night that it was an official, I think,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
that you were going to be on SNL.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Oh, wow. Yeah.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Then that would have been...

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Had I already auditioned for it, do you remember?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
I think they just came and scouted you.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I don't know if you had auditioned.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
The only thing that scouted...

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Maybe that's what it is. Maybe you got the audition.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
It was a manager.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
It was a manager that saw myself and K Cannon

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
who I was in the cast with

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
and then a guy named Seamus McCarthy

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
and that manager picked us all up

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
and then we made...

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
The guys made tapes

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
because they were looking for guys, I think,

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
or at least I made a tape.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
And I just filmed the show, basically,

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
and then sent it in.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
And so I knew maybe I was going to get to go audition.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
I would assume maybe at that point.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
But they offered you a deal, as I recall,

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
that had been...

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
There was a template for it in the past.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
It was like, you know...

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Getting hired as a writer.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Yeah, yeah.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
So I went to go audition for the show

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
and then didn't get it,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
but they liked me

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
and then I got...

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
A week later, they were like,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
hey, why don't you come out again?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And this is when you meet Lauren Michaels

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
and he's just making sure you're not crazy

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
or I think he just said

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
he wants to make sure you're someone

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
that if you walk by in the hallway at 2 a.m.,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
he wouldn't be scared or worried.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
It makes sense.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
It's his gig.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
What do you think started that rule?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Yeah, exactly.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Like, who do you think made that happen?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Either someone or else it was a part of him

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
that he didn't want to do it.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
You know what I mean?

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I mean, you know...

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
It was Tim Meadow.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
It was Tim Meadow.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
He's just a loose cannon.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I'm just going to say loose gun,

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
hot cannon, none of my jokes.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
But we...

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Yeah.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
So then you go out there

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
and then I got hired as a writer,

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
which I was a little bit like,

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
oh, it's a...

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
It was like, oh, nuts.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Which is ridiculous.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
But I didn't send in a packet.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I had an imposter syndrome,

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
all that stuff once getting it.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
And then you just kind of like

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
just say yes and then hope to God it all works out.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
And it paid off.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
You kind of knew that.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
They were kind of grooming you a bit

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
for being on the cast, right?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah, and that was what you were talking about.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
At that point, there was like...

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
There was like Tina had done it

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
and David Spade had done it

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
and Sandler had done it

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
and like even back in the day,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Chevy did it kind of, you know,

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
to a degree.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Who else?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
There's like everybody...

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Robert Schneider?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Yeah, everybody that had done it in the past,

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
you know, that been a writer

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
and was a cast member

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
had all made that...

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
You sort of knew who they were.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Well, they never tell you about Gourby Phillips.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah, never, yeah.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Gourby doesn't get his love.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
He's the guy who wanted to be an actor.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
They gave him a job as a writer

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
and he's still there.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Oh.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
His office is in the basement.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Horrible writer, hilarious in the room.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Hilarious in the room.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
You love him in the room.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
You love him in there.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
It just keeps people laughing.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I remember Jason, like after the first season

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
or two of you and the cast,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
you would come back to LA

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
and we'd go have a drink

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
and you would just sit down

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
and just dump like how difficult

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
that job was.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
It seemed like it was like...

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
But always making sure

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
he was very thankful

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
and said everyone was very wonderful.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Jeff, it's like Israel over there.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
By design.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
By design.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
By design.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
You know.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
But also like our friend,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
like Andy Samber,

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
like every time I saw him

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
he seemed to have aged about 10 years.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Oh, it's like the presidency in that way.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah, it's like...

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Until you sort of like develop

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
like a niche, I think,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
or I would like,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
with this guy to my left,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
like such an original sort of voice

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
that Lauren's like,

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
oh, this is a variety show.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I need to have what Will does on there

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
or like the Lonely Island, guys.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
I need to have the Lonely Island.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
That generation, you know, like Kristen.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I need to have a...

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
I need to have a Kristen track

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
on those greatest hits.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Right.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
It's like...

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
I talked to somebody about

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
how Lauren has always been...

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
That's always been his real secret

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
underneath it all.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
I think because it was back

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
when Channel 101 was starting

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
to be a thing

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
and the Lonely Island guys

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
were doing Channel 101

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
and then all of a sudden,

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
oh my god, they're taking

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
that different path,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
that Schiller reel...

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Right.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Mr. Bill path to SNL,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
which is a...

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
And somebody was talking to me

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
about it and they said,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
oh no, but Lauren's a genius

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
like about that in particular

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
that he always recognized

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
that, you know,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
the potential obsolescence

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
of what he was doing there

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
and how any one of these random

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
asteroids or geniuses

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
that, you know,

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
he had this way of like...

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
He would beckon you in and say,

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
look, I know what you want

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
and I know what you deserve

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
and I'm going to set you up

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
so that you can have it.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
So the Lonely Island

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
were getting their card

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
that said it's an SNL digital short.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
That's their property.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
He knew that about Smigol.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
He understood that you can't

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
create an army of generals.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
You have to like give them...

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
You have to let them have the illusion

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
that they have their own world.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Yeah.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
No, it's true.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I would say that he is good at that.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
You have to earn that though.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
How far into...

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Will and Jason, like how far,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
like along when you were a cast member,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
was it when you found like,

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
okay, this is my niche.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
This is my thing.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Did that take a while or...

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Because I remember like at one point,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
you guys were just my favorite.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Like that cast was really good.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
And you two together especially

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
because I went to one of the tapings

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
and you guys doing that

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
your mustached ESPN3

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
kind of character was hilarious.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
But like, did it take a while

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
to find your stride and find like,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
okay, this is my shit.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
This is what I do.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I mean, it depends for everybody

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
because I would always kind of do

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
weirder stuff and it's hard

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
to get that stuff on.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
So you have to kind of build up this trust

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and I was...

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
It would kill on Wednesday as PS.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Like the read through, it was like,

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
every time like you see,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
because at the top of every script,

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
it's the writer's names.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
So like you'd see like, you know,

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Faye and Polar.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Or like if it said Forte,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
you're just kind of like,

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
even if you've been there five hours,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
you're like, oh, here we go.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I mean, it's the truth, it's the truth.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
And especially when you were writing

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
with Sloven and Allen,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
like there was this ironing,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
sharpening iron thing that was brewing there

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
that I don't think really kicked in

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
to Jeff's question.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Like until maybe our group came in

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
because I felt like just watching it

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
outside, your stuff started to get that play.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Like after you stopped playing Bush, really.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Oh, for sure.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I was, you know, I...

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
It was an honor to play Bush,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
but it was an honor I did not want.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
It was, you know...

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Because then I ended up playing it.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
You know, Will Ferrell had just done it.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
I know.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
It's like, what are we doing?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
It was, you know, to me,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
it's like Dana Carvey doing The Church Lady.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Yeah.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Like Bush...

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Will Ferrell had turned Bush

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
into a character that was so...

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Flat out one in the election.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
One in the election.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Ruined our country for eight years

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
by his talent, his charm.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
You can't have, you know,

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Dana Carvey would not leave

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
and then somebody else come in

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
and do The Church Lady, so...

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
But you have to do The President.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Right.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
So I, you know, somehow became that guy,

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
and I was shitty at it.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
That's not true.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
At the beginning, you know,

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
when he was all whiny,

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
like you were great at it,

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
because you were like,

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
ah, man, and he was like...

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Well, I...

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
And then he changed.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
It certainly was not the kind of stuff

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
I liked to do.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
And, you know, I was...

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
It was a fun adventure,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
but, like, that...

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
The cast was so big at the time

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
that, like, a lot of times I would

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
be putting out the kind of stuff

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
that I liked.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Right.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
But, you know,

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
you got to service everybody,

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
so I would get these...

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
You got your sketch in five minutes.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Bush things that were in there

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
that weren't necessarily my thing,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
and that would be the thing

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
for that episode.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
So, like, for a couple years,

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
I was just kind of the Bush guy

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
and didn't really get to do...

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
But there was also this...

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
I remember who told me about this,

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
but then I started looking for it,

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
that in those years,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
there was closer to midnight.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
It was like, okay, these...

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Like, I always tried to figure out

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
the formula with the last sketch on SNL.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
It was like, sometimes it was clearly

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
just the shittiest.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Sometimes it was one that, like...

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
I have no idea.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
You guys could tell me,

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
and maybe for political reasons,

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
you wouldn't even be able to,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
or it would take too long,

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
or there is no formula,

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
but then somebody told me, like,

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
watch the...

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
But sometimes it's like,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
these, like, weird pieces

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
of esoteric brilliance,

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
these, like, just good quality sketches

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
that were...

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
And it was Forte's name

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
that was, like, attached to that.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
It was like, oh, that's a...

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
You got to watch till midnight,

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
because there might be a Forte sketch coming,

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
because they're putting them there,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
not because they don't believe in them,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
but because, like, the spelling of the sketch.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Like, a hidden trap.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
That was what I was going to say

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
was the episode

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
that where I felt like it all kicked in.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
That was Jack Black hosting

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
the Christmas episode

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
of what happened to be,

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
oddly enough,

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
my generation's first season.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
I was lucky to be there two years.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
I was there.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
You were there.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
So you had...

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
You had Jack Black kicking ass

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
his second time hosting,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
singing an amazing King Kong opener.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Then you have...

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Then you have...

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
There was the...

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
With Wigan and I,

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
the first A-holes,

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
two A-holes buying a Christmas tree.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
You had Christmas time for the Jews,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
a short thing of...

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Amazing short film parody

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
by Smigel.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
You had Spelling Bee

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
with Forte.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
And then most importantly,

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
I would say,

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
most iconically lazy Sunday

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
by Lonely Island.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
And that was just like...

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
It was all one episode.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
It gives me goosebumps.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
What was that one season?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
One episode.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
That was the Christmas episode

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
of 2005.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
So that must be why

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
I was watching it,

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
because, like, my friends were like,

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
like, oh, my God,

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
they had just gone up.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
I was at the party

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
where Bill Hader was also...

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Alongside them

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
was, like, being sent up

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
in a balloon to New York.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Absolutely.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Goodbye, guys.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Sorry.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
And so I must have been watching

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
that night going,

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
oh, this is the first,

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
or maybe it was just because

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
it was a lazy Sunday thing,

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
because they had done stuff

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
before that,

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
and the lazy Sunday

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
was kind of their whatever.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
But the Spelling Bee thing,

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
I just want to talk about

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
for a second,

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
the sketch,

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
the Spelling Bee sketch,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
I'm sure if you just type

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
it into YouTube,

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
who knows,

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
or if it's something,

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
you just find it.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
It simply judges

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
at a Spelling Bee saying,

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
all right,

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
your next word is...

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
What's the next word?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Business.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Business.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
And then the entire sketch

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
from front to back

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
is Will Forte

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
incorrectly spelling business.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
And that's it.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
That's the whole sketch.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
He doesn't finish, like,

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
you know,

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
and then they go,

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
oh, that's not quite right.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Why don't you try a simpler word,

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
like cat,

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
and then he does it three times,

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
and then in the end,

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
he spells a really complicated word

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
really well,

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
and then you're done.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
The entire sketch

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
is him failing

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
to spell the word business.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
And it's not a short sketch.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
It's Conehead's size.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
It's a proper size,

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
a Hungry Man,

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Jack's sketch size,

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
but the whole meal

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
is just different letters.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Q, Q, Q.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
How many times do you say Q?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Q.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Would you do numbers

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
at one point,

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
like adding numbers

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
into it?

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
That was a hard one to get on,

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
because I had done it

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
at the groundlings

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
a bunch of times.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Killing it.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Killing it at the groundlings.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
This would go very well

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
at the groundlings.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
You did it at SNL.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
It wouldn't get picked.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
You would do it at,

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
like Smigel would have you

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
do nine of too many stars.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
You'd play like Radio City

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Music Hall and do it.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
It would crush,

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
and then they would put it

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
at the table,

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
or wherever you guys were

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
doing those,

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
where he would ask you to do

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
it at a benefit.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
It would crush,

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
and he'd bring it back

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
to like, you know,

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
17th floor,

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
like, you know,

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
50 people watching.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Everybody's just like,

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
it's killing,

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
but everybody's like,

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
it's never going to get on.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
And it wasn't...

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Well, I got a handle,

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
like Jack Black was the one

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
going forward,

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
because he, you know,

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
he is great,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
and he's such a champion of

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
comedy,

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
and just really like it.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
You got to put it before it did.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
If it wasn't for him,

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
yeah,

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
if it wasn't for him,

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
it wouldn't have gotten on.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
What was that like?

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Same with A-holes.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
When you wrote a really

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
weird sketch

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
that was kind of esoteric

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
and strange,

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
and you go into that

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
read-through,

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
where everybody's,

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
you know,

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
you've got the piles of paper,

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
all the scripts,

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
you're reading through

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
everything,

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
you have to get up

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
and really perform that,

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
like at the table.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
And you get all that

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
to the room, right?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Oh, yeah.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
I mean,

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
most of the time,

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
you're just sitting down.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Every once in a while,

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
if there's something

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
with a little more action,

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
you might stand up

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
and do some of this stuff.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
But, you know,

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
you do it pretty full-out.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
You're something

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
that maybe no one thinks to...

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
What does the writer's room

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
look like?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
When you're at SNL,

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
and it's like...

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
It's like an office,

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
it's like a conference room,

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
like a vibe.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
It's like,

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
it's almost like

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
the comments.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
It's a big table,

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
everyone's sitting around it.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
But then it's on the outer walls,

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
everybody's sitting around it.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
And depending on

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
how many there are,

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
like right now,

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
there's probably not much elbow room.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
It got to a point

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
when we were there

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
that there was like a nice amount of room.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
So the cast is around the table,

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
and then there's a search.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
At the head of the table

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
is Lorne and the host.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
And then cast, cast, cast,

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
cast, cast, cast, cast,

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
then around this side,

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
like if you were looking down

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
at three o'clock is,

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
like Seth,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
and one of the assistant

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
directors, Jeanine,

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
who times every sketch.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
One of the producers,

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Steve Higgins,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
somebody else.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
But then around the sides

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
are like the department heads.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
All the writers

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
are like at nine o'clock

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
behind here,

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
like four rows deep.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
People are sometimes sleeping

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
because they've been up

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
since 10 a.m.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Oh, okay.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
So this is a room

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
where there's a table.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
You're describing,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
this is a table read.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Table read.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Yes.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
What does the,

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
like what about just

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
the room in which

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
people are pitching sketches?

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
It mostly happens in offices.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Yeah.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
It's like a normal

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
office building

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
with just a more open

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
fart policy.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
It looks like 30 rock.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
I mean, it looks like,

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
that's, I mean, you know,

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
like the TV show.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
But when you're a writer,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
are you sitting,

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
like,

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
like when you think,

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
are you sitting

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
cross-legged on a carpeted floor

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
with a,

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
with a sheaf of papers

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
in front of you,

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
notes scribbled on them,

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
waiting your turn

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
to pitch something?

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Yes.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
On Mondays with the host,

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
there's the host meeting,

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
the pitch meeting.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Everybody lines up

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
when we all sit in Lauren's office.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Some people on chairs,

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
like humans,

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
other people on the ground.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Have you told,

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
have you told it too many times

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
on too many shows,

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
but that your Snoop Dogg story,

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
would that be a pain

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
to retell?

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Because I retell

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
your Snoop Dogg story

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
when you were a writer.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Yeah, you know, I remember,

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
yeah, the,

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
no, I mean,

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
I don't mind telling it.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
It's a good life philosophy.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Really?

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Yes.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
But yeah.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
We were,

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
on Tuesday nights,

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
the host goes around

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
wherever it is,

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
and they meet with the

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
different writers.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
And this was,

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
it was actually,

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
I think it was your office

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
at the time.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
You were rooming with

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
and it was me and Rich,

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Tellerico,

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
and I think you might have

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
maybe been in there if not.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Pitching ideas to Snoop,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
I just love Rich's idea so much

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
that I always feel obligated

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
to put him in here.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
He's tell Snoop,

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Snoop just sitting there

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
like this,

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
and he's like,

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
I have this idea where you play

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
a dad,

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
but you know that scene

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
like at the dinner table

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
when the kid mounts off

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
and he takes off the belt,

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
you don't take off your belt,

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
your job is,

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
you make a living as a beekeeper,

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
so you slowly start to put

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
on your beekeeper outfit.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
To intimidate your kids.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
And I swear to God,

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Snoop's like,

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
like yeah,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
yeah, I like that,

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
I like that.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Yeah.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
I want this guy to be

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
real scientific about the bees.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
You know what I mean?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Like I want him to know

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
what's going on inside

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
of a bee's mind.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Literally, he's saying that.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Other things,

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
blah, blah, blah.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
We're playing music,

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
we're playing music.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Rich is,

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
he's got these speakers in there

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
and he's blaring

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
like Snoop dog hits

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
and he's like,

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
yeah, see I put a cover

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
on him because you got to look

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
backward before you look forward.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Like he would just talk like this.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
He would just say,

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
yeah,

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
yeah man.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Like Urban Outfitters,

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
I've always said to just

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
follow him around with a pen

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
and pen and be like,

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
we're making pillows, T-shirts,

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
this is like,

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
this fucking guy.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Unbelievable.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
And then at the end,

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Rich,

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
and you know,

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
I mean I was just observing,

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Rich is really the point guard

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
of this entire narrative,

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
but Rich goes,

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Snoop after the party on Saturday,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
we got a kick in.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Snoop says,

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
swear to God,

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
he says,

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
because this is at the height

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
for shizzle.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
And he goes,

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
and Rich,

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
for whatever reason,

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
goes,

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
maybe we'll get a hoe.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
And Snoop just goes,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
why can only one hoe?

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Right?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
He could have,

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
he could have stopped there.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
He could have stopped there

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
and let me draw my own conclusion.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Then it's all sort of

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
like,

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
what does he mean by that?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
You know,

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
like,

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
he goes on,

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
he goes,

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
don't put limits on your life.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Again,

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
you're kind of like,

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
that's it,

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
he can get up and leave now.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
The Urban Outfitters person

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
can close their mole skin

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
and be like,

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
okay,

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
we got next week's shirt,

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
we're good.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Why get only one hoe?

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Why not get,

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
why not get two or three?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
I'm sorry,

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
don't put limits on your life.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
And then he says,

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
dream big,

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
dream big,

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
and you may never wake up.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
I don't know

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
if he's said it since,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I don't know if he remembers saying it.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Did you,

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
did you run and write it down?

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
No,

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
I've just told it so many,

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
like a good joke.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
I've just told it so many times,

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
like,

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
I remember you telling me that

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
and we're like,

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
that's your Leno's story.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
I think you told it on Leno's story.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
I told it on Conan,

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
the first,

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
the first like talk show I did.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
You,

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
you're like,

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
oh,

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
I have my Conan story.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Yeah,

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
I'm,

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
yeah,

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
he's giving me this,

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
like,

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
I got this,

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
you know.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
The,

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
the,

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
the,

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
the,

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
and what do you like,

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Jewish people?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Yeah,

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
you assume so.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
It's the,

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
the,

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
oh, I made the Israel comment earlier,

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
now I have to counterbalance that.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I gotta remember some anti-Christian shit.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
It's out there,

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
it's out there.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
That war is still happening, right?

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Jews versus Christians?

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Yeah.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I don't want to get mixed up in that.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
What,

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
whoa,

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
whoa,

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
whoa,

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
you guys are both writers,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
you're both performers.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
You,

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
you,

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
you,

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Forte,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
you were in the,

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
I love this question.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Yeah,

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
right?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
You were in the,

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
wait till it gets to the end of it,

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
it's important.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
You helped him write this one.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Yeah,

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
yeah,

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
yeah,

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
working all day on this question.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
We have a mutual friend,

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Jim Rash,

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
you were in Groundlings with him,

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
right?

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
That was your class,

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
like,

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
like,

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
he's a writer,

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
director,

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
he's an Oscar-winning writer,

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
writer and actor.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Writer actors are better actors

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
than regular actors.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
And,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
don't,

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
don't comment on that,

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
because I'm,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I'm sure you have actor friends.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
But,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
but what I want to ask is,

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
like,

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
what,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
what are you more?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
I don't know.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
I,

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
you know,

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
the question is,

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
what are you more?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Do you think of yourself

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
when you're standing on set as an actor,

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
like,

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
okay,

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
I'm not acting job,

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
but I'm a writer,

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
or is it the other way around?

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Well,

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
I started off as a writer,

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
so I,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
I think I'll always think of myself

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
as more of a writer.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Uh,

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
uh,

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
I,

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
at the end of my third year.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
You wrote before you did Groundlings?

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Uh,

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
yeah,

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
well,

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
I did,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
I did go through your,

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
yeah,

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
I was,

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
I was,

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
I wasn't writing professionally.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
We could go through your past

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
for a second here,

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
because it's kind of interesting.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
I bothered to Wikipedia you

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
when I heard you might be coming by,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
and the most notable thing first

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
is your name is,

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
your,

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
your given name is

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Orville

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Wilbert?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Orville Willis.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Orville Willis

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Forte to Forte.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Forte to Fourth.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Yes.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
I've never met a fourth before.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
I know,

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
it's,

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
you know,

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
it's pretty cool.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Are you making fun of his name?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
No,

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
I'm making fun of America.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
We've never had a fourth generation

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
of anything here.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Everything around you is

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
20 years old,

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
architecturally.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
That's made of rock.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Like,

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
this is a flesh thing,

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
made of four,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
four strings of dude.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
That's,

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
that's European,

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
man.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
That's heavy shit.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
We got our episode title.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
We have a titular moment.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
We have had our moment.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
We'll say there was,

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
there was,

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
when I first,

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
I,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I wrote on sitcoms for a while.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
I wrote at Letterman,

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
wrote at,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Third Rock for the Sun,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
the 70s show,

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
then got the SNL job.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
And there,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
it,

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
I definitely was,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
had more of a writer's mentality,

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
because I would be,

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
I'd go in and when,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
when I would act my own stuff,

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
I would,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
the stuff that I had written,

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I would feel very confident in it.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I'd know exactly what to do.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
And I would get into my head with,

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
because I had to remember,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
if I would write stuff and,

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
you know,

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
sitting back there as other people

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
would do it and just going,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
I wanted it.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
And it'd be very, you know,

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
and,

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
and so in my head,

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
as I was doing other people's things,

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
I would just be thinking about how upset they were

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
about the choices I was making.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
So at the end of the third season at SNL,

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
over the summer,

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
there,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
there was this really,

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
the cast was very big.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Lauren was thinking about making changes

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
and,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
and there's a date in July

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
when you're supposed to be told

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
whether your option is picked up

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
And they had Independence Day.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Yeah.

42:50.000 --> 42:56.640
And they held off on picking up my option and it took an extension and for like six weeks

42:56.640 --> 43:03.360
I had to wait and the final conversation I had with him was, he said, you know, you

43:03.360 --> 43:07.440
are thinking too much like a writer, you need to own it a little more.

43:07.440 --> 43:14.800
And of course I'm like, oh fuck this old man, he has no idea, but I come back.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.560
And the more I thought about it, he was absolutely right.

43:16.560 --> 43:21.240
I was just like, I would be too nervous about performing in other people's things.

43:21.240 --> 43:25.800
And so once I, he just, you know, he gave me the best advice of all time, which was

43:25.800 --> 43:31.240
just to go in there and make the characters your own in other people's things.

43:31.240 --> 43:32.720
And we'll just let her rip.

43:32.720 --> 43:33.720
Yeah.

43:33.720 --> 43:34.720
Exactly.

43:34.720 --> 43:38.480
And thank God he let me come back and that really was like, you know, knowing that I had

43:38.480 --> 43:42.480
almost been fired, it all felt like gravy and then it was just like, okay, fuck it.

43:42.480 --> 43:47.120
He's like, look, if these writers knew better than actors, they'd be actors.

43:47.120 --> 43:51.760
Like they, they're so smart, but they can't act like you could come in and take their

43:51.760 --> 43:55.880
stuff and take it to the, take it to the end zone where, yeah, and your experience had

43:55.880 --> 43:56.880
been as a writer.

43:56.880 --> 44:02.240
I would sometimes get their stuff down to like the 25.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.600
But suds, you're probably a little more complicated, right?

44:04.600 --> 44:08.320
Because you're not quite as, I mean, he was a writer forever and you're like, you're,

44:08.320 --> 44:10.880
you're an improviser, which is half and half already.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.400
You're like a golden doodle.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.400
Right.

44:13.400 --> 44:18.280
But you're, you're also, we call Jason suds.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.280
Yeah.

44:19.280 --> 44:20.280
Yes.

44:20.280 --> 44:21.280
All right.

44:21.280 --> 44:27.000
But your passion was for performing originally, I mean, and so, and then they're saying to

44:27.000 --> 44:29.160
you, well, yeah, but you're a writer, right?

44:29.160 --> 44:30.320
And then they're putting you in the writers group.

44:30.320 --> 44:35.880
So when you're out, when you're in front of a camera or on a pink and seafoam poster

44:35.880 --> 44:41.640
with three starlets and then your face, part of my face, they put, they added some stuff

44:41.640 --> 44:42.640
to my face.

44:42.640 --> 44:43.640
Eyebrows.

44:43.640 --> 44:44.640
Yeah.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.640
But I know what you mean.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.920
When you're, when you're, when you're studding it up in front of the unblinking eye over

44:47.920 --> 44:51.840
the shoulder, your beard, your beard and the mother's day poster is really great.

44:51.840 --> 44:52.840
Yeah.

44:52.840 --> 44:53.840
It's really, yeah.

44:53.840 --> 44:55.560
Like, it's like Drake density.

44:55.560 --> 45:00.320
It's like, it's like, it's a healthy, healthy, but my eyebrows, like when I look at, I go,

45:00.320 --> 45:05.280
I wish I told you knows where I'd be if I look like that.

45:05.280 --> 45:07.400
It's like a little kid's hobo costume.

45:07.400 --> 45:09.440
They're stippling involved.

45:09.440 --> 45:13.640
I texted Jason, like a picture of that poster, I said, please, I don't know what this movie

45:13.640 --> 45:16.800
is about, but please tell me that you're a high-priced male hustler.

45:16.800 --> 45:17.800
Yeah.

45:17.800 --> 45:24.960
And your, your eyebrows have their own beards, like it's, it's, you're, you're, you're made

45:24.960 --> 45:25.960
of beards in that.

45:25.960 --> 45:26.960
It's amazing.

45:26.960 --> 45:27.960
Yeah.

45:27.960 --> 45:28.960
Yeah.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.960
No, it's, it's, I am, I'm with you when I saw it, I was just like, yeah, I mean, it was,

45:30.960 --> 45:31.960
you know, whatever.

45:31.960 --> 45:32.960
That's so great.

45:32.960 --> 45:39.360
So are, so are you an actor that has used your extra ability to write to, to, to, I

45:39.360 --> 45:40.360
think so.

45:40.360 --> 45:41.360
I would say, I would say so.

45:41.360 --> 45:42.360
I, I, I do.

45:42.360 --> 45:46.400
I mean, I, I, there's, there's such a, for me, like with acting, like nobody cares, but

45:46.400 --> 45:50.640
like, since you're sort of asking about it, like, of like the left brain, right brain,

45:50.640 --> 45:55.160
like I think I'm, I'm envious of, of actors that can really just like, just like be in

45:55.160 --> 45:56.160
it.

45:56.160 --> 45:59.160
I feel like I can get there because, but my left brain's always working.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.080
The part of you that has to hit a mark, the part of you that has to like know where the

46:02.080 --> 46:05.280
light is and all that kind of stuff, especially like tracking shots, all that stuff, I can

46:05.280 --> 46:06.280
handle really well.

46:06.280 --> 46:10.280
And I think that comes from like playing basketball as a kid, like running plays and stuff, like

46:10.280 --> 46:11.280
it's like,

46:11.280 --> 46:13.640
So sports, sports come back around to haunt me.

46:13.640 --> 46:17.920
But I think it could have happened with like any, any sort of group mentality.

46:17.920 --> 46:22.160
I just didn't have like, you know, the group of kids that in my neighborhood, they played

46:22.160 --> 46:24.000
sports, they didn't put on plays.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
You know what I mean?

46:25.000 --> 46:27.440
I don't mean as a smart ass cause I know there are neighborhoods like that and I was lucky

46:27.440 --> 46:29.720
to meet those kind of kids in high school.

46:29.720 --> 46:35.400
But like it, so I'm like always cognizant of like what's, what is needed to happen to

46:35.400 --> 46:42.320
make it like, like at least not have to cut because of some mal, like physical malfunction.

46:42.320 --> 46:43.320
You know what I mean?

46:43.320 --> 46:44.320
That brings up an interesting question.

46:44.320 --> 46:49.640
Forte, do you, you're writing for yourself and that means to a powerful degree, you're

46:49.640 --> 46:53.680
blocking yourself like, like a director could come in and say, no, I think you should be

46:53.680 --> 46:54.680
in the doorway.

46:54.680 --> 46:55.680
Sorry, I burped.

46:55.680 --> 46:56.680
It's gross.

46:56.680 --> 46:58.400
You, you, I think you should be in the doorway and then you should, you should do a somersault

46:58.400 --> 47:02.360
and sometimes directors have great ideas and sometimes they're just directors that the,

47:02.360 --> 47:11.480
the, the, you, you first and foremost, if you're writing a scene.

47:11.480 --> 47:14.480
It's how you respond to that sentence that says more about anything.

47:14.480 --> 47:15.480
You know what I mean?

47:15.480 --> 47:20.000
I'm sure it was very visual, whatever's going on down there, but it doesn't tell a story

47:20.000 --> 47:23.240
at the end of the day and Rob's mind, we need both.

47:23.240 --> 47:24.240
We need both.

47:24.240 --> 47:27.480
Rob is drawing a storyboard of him killing you right now.

47:27.480 --> 47:34.480
No, but, so, I'm doing a bird's eye of taking a shit on his car.

47:34.480 --> 47:35.480
Do you?

47:35.480 --> 47:36.480
Okay.

47:36.480 --> 47:37.480
I wish directors did bird's eyes.

47:37.480 --> 47:42.480
You're doing a shot list of being in your drink.

47:42.480 --> 47:48.240
You're, you sit, you, you, you, you, you have a specific brain.

47:48.240 --> 47:53.000
I mean, you're like, like, like, are you, so you're, here you're this guy that's going

47:53.000 --> 47:56.560
like, you're kind of like, oh, I want this joke to land, et cetera, et cetera.

47:56.560 --> 47:59.520
I won't repeat the process that you took us through, but then you're in a laptop.

47:59.520 --> 48:04.240
So you're writing that a character is going to be played by you and you, I guess the

48:04.240 --> 48:09.360
small part of my question is like, do you do things like mitigate your, your blocking

48:09.360 --> 48:10.360
in the scene?

48:10.360 --> 48:12.960
Do you go like, look, I don't want to do a bunch of complicated shit in this scene because

48:12.960 --> 48:17.720
I'm going to start, I'm only going to be funny if I'm able to sit still and like remember

48:17.720 --> 48:22.560
my lines or, or, or are you like, no, I need to occupy myself, anything like that.

48:22.560 --> 48:27.480
Like, do you, do you, knowing yourself as a performer, when you're writing, do you write

48:27.480 --> 48:28.480
specific things for yourself?

48:28.480 --> 48:32.440
Well, certainly you will write to your strengths, but, but every once in a while there will

48:32.440 --> 48:37.360
be things that bring you outside your comfort zone if, if you get together, together with

48:37.360 --> 48:41.560
the writers and they all think it's a great idea and you think, all right, let's fucking

48:41.560 --> 48:42.560
go for it.

48:42.560 --> 48:47.120
You know, it's, it, it really is a, but for the most part you can, you can really, you'll

48:47.120 --> 48:52.720
know the stuff you're good at, not very good at, and you kind of stick with the stuff you're

48:52.720 --> 48:53.720
good at.

48:53.720 --> 48:57.600
I think all that stuff literally comes down to like trust of, of, you know, like literally

48:57.600 --> 49:01.240
like where I'm going to be, I'll ask, I'll be asked to do this.

49:01.240 --> 49:04.560
Like me staying in my head, I don't think it's necessarily healthy, like all the time

49:04.560 --> 49:08.800
as, as even though I feel connected more as a actor than a writer, the part of me that

49:08.800 --> 49:13.480
doesn't let me get out of my head is probably not giving the person directing me the majority

49:13.480 --> 49:17.480
of the time enough trust to just be out of my own head, to maybe have an assessment of

49:17.480 --> 49:18.480
it.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.840
But I don't in the middle of, of a scene.

49:19.840 --> 49:23.400
It's only like when looking at the sides or thinking about it, if they suggest something,

49:23.400 --> 49:24.960
I'll be like, oh no.

49:24.960 --> 49:28.120
So I think like with stuff, you would have stuff in your head in scenes that we would

49:28.120 --> 49:31.840
do and then we would sort of talk about stuff and maybe you would feel, you're always very

49:31.840 --> 49:32.840
accommodating.

49:32.840 --> 49:35.640
It's not like you're rigid and like, I wrote it this way, so it has to be this way.

49:35.640 --> 49:36.640
Oh yeah.

49:36.640 --> 49:41.200
And if, and if, and if there's ever a director that wants to try something that's different

49:41.200 --> 49:46.640
than what I was thinking, it's always somebody like Jason Wallner who knows his shit and

49:46.640 --> 49:51.400
John Solomon are, you know, best buddy and, and, you know, these, these wonderful people

49:51.400 --> 49:56.640
who are super smart and, and, you know, got the bone to Rob Schrab for, you know, just

49:56.640 --> 49:57.640
for.

49:57.640 --> 49:58.640
Yeah, get them in there.

49:58.640 --> 49:59.640
I'm sure.

49:59.640 --> 50:00.640
Schrab, Schrab, I'm sure is great.

50:00.640 --> 50:01.640
Yeah.

50:01.640 --> 50:02.640
Yeah.

50:02.640 --> 50:03.640
Like, yeah.

50:03.640 --> 50:04.640
Thank you.

50:04.640 --> 50:05.640
Yeah.

50:05.640 --> 50:10.680
No, I've always, I've never, well, I've, well, I've had what you've had, which is like

50:10.680 --> 50:14.080
you write something, you hear it a certain way in your head, and it would be great if

50:14.080 --> 50:15.960
they did it exactly that way.

50:15.960 --> 50:19.760
Sometimes it's right in the bubble where you're trying to figure out, do I just want to hear

50:19.760 --> 50:21.080
this the way it was in my head?

50:21.080 --> 50:26.280
Am I objectively hearing it like, so I can decide actually, oh, that's, that's fine.

50:26.280 --> 50:27.280
No.

50:27.280 --> 50:32.040
Uh, then there's the, then there's the getting past that there's the, oh, someone, please

50:32.040 --> 50:33.040
help me with this.

50:33.040 --> 50:37.760
And if a director can think of a better blocking and sometimes, you know, um, like, like, like

50:37.760 --> 50:42.520
Heath Cullen's on, on Great Minds will like, like, like, I'll have a very basic thing in

50:42.520 --> 50:46.600
my head and then he'll go, yeah, but what if, what if the person was sitting behind the

50:46.600 --> 50:49.600
doorway and then you entered, so then we could all get it in one shot.

50:49.600 --> 50:54.360
There's always different shaped brains and they all overlap and, um, I'm sure Rob's great

50:54.360 --> 50:55.360
at something.

50:55.360 --> 51:05.720
The, um, the, uh, I told you he wouldn't have fun.

51:05.720 --> 51:12.040
I just remembered something that, uh, so we finished, I think I need a table next time.

51:12.040 --> 51:13.040
Next time I'm on the show.

51:13.040 --> 51:14.040
Oh yeah.

51:14.040 --> 51:17.120
What are you going to do with that table?

51:17.120 --> 51:19.280
Nothing I guess.

51:19.280 --> 51:24.320
Maybe you could use it to, uh, distant or a fuck.

51:24.320 --> 51:32.280
Maybe you can use it to stutter and emotionally distance yourself from the people on stage.

51:32.280 --> 51:33.280
It is so weird.

51:33.280 --> 51:35.880
I mean, he brings Spencer out first and he sits in the corner and we never talked from

51:35.880 --> 51:36.880
first.

51:36.880 --> 51:37.880
Yeah.

51:37.880 --> 51:38.880
Oh, I mean.

51:38.880 --> 51:39.880
And now you're bringing me out.

51:39.880 --> 51:40.880
Yeah.

51:40.880 --> 51:41.880
No, yeah.

51:41.880 --> 51:44.120
I was slowly going to fill the stage full of people who don't talk.

51:44.120 --> 51:45.120
No.

51:45.120 --> 51:46.120
Well, it's our fault.

51:46.120 --> 51:48.880
You guys were all kicking in before we got out here.

51:48.880 --> 51:49.880
It's all good.

51:49.880 --> 51:53.880
I just don't know anything about comedy or directing or, you know, those things you

51:53.880 --> 51:54.880
guys are talking about.

51:54.880 --> 51:55.880
Right.

51:55.880 --> 52:01.720
But otherwise you could be sure I'd be in there with barbs and jabs and bits.

52:01.720 --> 52:03.440
Why don't we talk about barbs?

52:03.440 --> 52:04.440
Oh, man.

52:04.440 --> 52:06.440
You want to talk about barbs for a second?

52:06.440 --> 52:08.920
Can we do a little barb corner?

52:08.920 --> 52:09.920
Yeah.

52:09.920 --> 52:10.920
Barb Thomas.

52:10.920 --> 52:13.440
Jesus Christ.

52:13.440 --> 52:15.240
Adrienne Barbo.

52:15.240 --> 52:16.240
There we go.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.480
Hey, Jason, Barb is in there.

52:18.480 --> 52:20.560
Jason, you brought a basketball earlier.

52:20.560 --> 52:21.560
You and I.

52:21.560 --> 52:22.560
No.

52:22.560 --> 52:23.560
No, no, no, no.

52:23.560 --> 52:24.560
This is.

52:24.560 --> 52:25.560
No, no.

52:25.560 --> 52:28.560
This is, this is more about comedy than about sports.

52:28.560 --> 52:30.560
Jason and I, Jason grew up in Kansas.

52:30.560 --> 52:31.560
Correct.

52:31.560 --> 52:33.920
He used to play with some dudes from the J-hawks, right?

52:33.920 --> 52:34.920
Like from the team.

52:34.920 --> 52:35.920
Sure.

52:35.920 --> 52:36.920
Yeah.

52:36.920 --> 52:37.920
Yeah.

52:37.920 --> 52:38.920
I mean.

52:38.920 --> 52:39.920
And Jason Sonegas, this dude can play basketball.

52:39.920 --> 52:40.920
He's really good.

52:40.920 --> 52:41.920
Well, not compared to those guys.

52:41.920 --> 52:47.920
But compared to everybody probably here, I would say, I can get rebound.

52:47.920 --> 52:53.040
But also like, you love your high top basketball shoes to the extent that you're, we went

52:53.040 --> 52:54.040
to your house.

52:54.040 --> 52:58.760
You got a room, you got a whole walk-in closet that's just for your high top basketball shoes,

52:58.760 --> 52:59.760
which is.

52:59.760 --> 53:00.760
There's low tops too.

53:00.760 --> 53:01.760
Yeah.

53:01.760 --> 53:03.760
I mean, with that much room, you got to have low tops too.

53:03.760 --> 53:06.920
Do you have any medium tops?

53:06.920 --> 53:07.920
Three-quarter tops?

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
Yeah.

53:08.920 --> 53:09.920
I'm wearing some.

53:09.920 --> 53:10.920
Damn, those tops are three-quarters.

53:10.920 --> 53:11.920
You are kidding.

53:11.920 --> 53:12.920
Look at those tops.

53:12.920 --> 53:13.920
Yeah.

53:13.920 --> 53:14.920
They don't go all the way up.

53:14.920 --> 53:15.920
So Jason and I.

53:15.920 --> 53:16.920
And they don't go all the way down either.

53:16.920 --> 53:17.920
They're kind of like, split the difference tops.

53:17.920 --> 53:18.920
They can't make a choice.

53:18.920 --> 53:19.920
Those tops, those tops split the difference.

53:19.920 --> 53:20.920
Oh.

53:20.920 --> 53:45.440
Between the high and the low, those are some Wednesday tops, 50% of the tops.

53:45.440 --> 53:49.960
So Jason and I went to go play basketball.

53:49.960 --> 53:50.960
So we went to a.

53:50.960 --> 53:51.960
Justifying.

53:51.960 --> 53:54.960
We went to a basketball court.

53:54.960 --> 53:55.960
We went to a basketball court.

53:55.960 --> 53:56.960
Cosby at the end.

53:56.960 --> 54:00.960
Those are some Wednesday tops.

54:00.960 --> 54:10.160
Those are, those tops are completely, those tops are, I'm telling you Camille, those

54:10.160 --> 54:15.200
tops are halfway up the ankle.

54:15.200 --> 54:16.200
That's not funny anymore.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.200
I know it's not.

54:17.200 --> 54:18.200
No.

54:18.200 --> 54:20.200
It is.

54:20.200 --> 54:21.200
It is actually.

54:21.200 --> 54:22.200
It is.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.200
It's getting funnier.

54:23.200 --> 54:24.200
The fact that we're not talking about why it isn't funny.

54:24.200 --> 54:25.200
We're making it really funny.

54:25.200 --> 54:26.200
And you were with Camille.

54:26.200 --> 54:27.200
It's really funny.

54:27.200 --> 54:34.680
So Jason and I go play a pickup game in West Hollywood, like on San Vicente.

54:34.680 --> 54:40.000
And I played there before and it's, it's pretty intense, like pickup basketball game.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.800
And some of the guys that talk a lot of trash, it's a lot of like a lot of big mouths.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.560
And it's usually the guys that aren't that good that are talking the most trash.

54:46.560 --> 54:47.560
Oh.

54:47.560 --> 54:48.880
But isn't that just the truth?

54:48.880 --> 54:50.880
Isn't that?

54:50.880 --> 54:53.120
So I missed my free throw.

54:53.120 --> 54:54.760
You got to make a free throw to get in the game.

54:54.760 --> 54:55.760
I missed my free throw.

54:55.760 --> 54:56.760
Jason gets on a team.

54:56.760 --> 54:57.920
So I'm just chilling.

54:57.920 --> 55:01.680
And Jason, I think you matched up against one of the biggest loud mouths on the opposing

55:01.680 --> 55:02.680
team.

55:02.680 --> 55:03.680
I usually do.

55:03.680 --> 55:07.320
And Jason had the funniest shit talk of all time.

55:07.320 --> 55:09.280
He kept scoring on this dude.

55:09.280 --> 55:12.960
And every time he'd come down the court, he would say, do you know that they call me the

55:12.960 --> 55:13.960
electrician?

55:13.960 --> 55:15.960
Like he would, he would have a new occupation.

55:15.960 --> 55:20.920
So he'd be dribbin' the ball, and the guy hated him so much, he's like, they call me

55:20.920 --> 55:23.920
the electrician, and he'd shoot it, and he goes, because I'm puttin' the lights out.

55:23.920 --> 55:27.800
What were the other ones?

55:27.800 --> 55:28.800
I'm sure the waiter.

55:28.800 --> 55:29.800
What was the waiter?

55:29.800 --> 55:34.720
Like, dropping, no, no, no, the waiter was servin' up funky dishes.

55:34.720 --> 55:39.240
There was the plumber.

55:39.240 --> 55:42.800
Clumsy cashier was droppin' dimes.

55:42.800 --> 55:45.800
I like that you could be there.

55:45.800 --> 55:51.120
You'd be so good at basketball that you'd become bad at another job.

55:51.120 --> 55:56.120
They call me the terrible mailman, because I'm not bringing anything to you.

55:56.120 --> 55:59.120
Get out of my diner, don't play basketball!

55:59.120 --> 56:01.120
I said get!

56:01.120 --> 56:07.800
But I remember the other team- I'm such a terrible janitor at this diner, I should

56:07.800 --> 56:10.800
be mere!

56:10.800 --> 56:16.720
Yeah, a lot of people don't sniff that out, right?

56:16.720 --> 56:20.840
What book did he read that made him think he could be Mary Harrell Hill Valley?

56:20.840 --> 56:24.960
But there was a point when you were pissing off that guy, that even his own teammates

56:24.960 --> 56:29.080
were laughing at him, because you kept clownin' him, and it was the greatest.

56:29.080 --> 56:32.800
I just remembered one thing from the Mushroom Adventure.

56:32.800 --> 56:39.840
After my hand was laid on the surface of the water, and I communed with all life, Cody

56:39.840 --> 56:46.440
was back in the bungalow, rolling around on the bed, because it was soft, and then

56:46.440 --> 56:53.960
I went and we made the mistake of trying all kinds of things, but you don't need to know

56:53.960 --> 56:56.360
about that, or picture it.

56:56.360 --> 56:58.120
I want to know everything about that.

56:58.120 --> 57:00.600
I want to know a little bit about that.

57:00.600 --> 57:08.400
But there was a point, I wrote down the quote, both individually rolling around, because

57:08.400 --> 57:13.280
for me the ceiling was like a pool, and there was like, I might fall in it if I close my

57:13.280 --> 57:26.680
eyes, and then Cody said, I want a baby, or maybe, or maybe I just want a soft bathrobe.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.680
And she should have the right to make that choice.

57:28.680 --> 57:29.680
No, no, that's...

57:29.680 --> 57:30.680
That is a woman's decision.

57:30.680 --> 57:31.680
That is a woman's decision.

57:31.680 --> 57:32.680
Alright guys, thanks so much.

57:32.680 --> 57:43.360
It's one of the two though for sure, so it's a kind of...

57:43.360 --> 57:47.240
Jason, can we talk about this the first time that I ever did it?

57:47.240 --> 57:48.240
Are you okay talking about it?

57:48.240 --> 57:49.240
The mushrooms?

57:49.240 --> 57:50.240
Yeah.

57:50.240 --> 57:51.240
What do you mean, like sponsors and stuff?

57:51.240 --> 57:52.240
Yeah.

57:52.240 --> 57:53.240
Like my AA sponsors?

57:53.240 --> 57:54.240
Exactly.

57:54.240 --> 57:55.240
No, I'm fine with it.

57:55.240 --> 57:56.240
The first time I ever did mushrooms was...

57:56.240 --> 57:57.240
What was your friend's name?

57:57.240 --> 57:58.240
Mike.

57:58.240 --> 57:59.240
Mike Lucas.

57:59.240 --> 58:00.240
And the three of us, we did it, and we went to your apartment.

58:00.240 --> 58:03.120
Is that the correct thing that it was right on the intersection where Tupac was murdered?

58:03.120 --> 58:04.680
Yeah, Flamingo and Koval, yeah.

58:04.680 --> 58:07.520
They'd cleaned it up since then, but yeah, it was...

58:07.520 --> 58:10.480
Yeah, that's where it was.

58:10.480 --> 58:12.440
The meridian was the name of the...

58:12.440 --> 58:17.040
There was a little ritual that you guys put me through at the beginning, we chopped up

58:17.040 --> 58:20.960
the stems and the caps, and there was some little vehicle, like a little choo-choo train

58:20.960 --> 58:21.960
or a little...

58:21.960 --> 58:26.880
That was all improvised, like that was Mike being stoned before, I think, on mushrooms,

58:26.880 --> 58:28.480
and just a very, like, creative guy.

58:28.480 --> 58:30.920
There was, like, a little, like, wheelbarrow or choo-choo train.

58:30.920 --> 58:34.480
We created, like, a little, like, a little, um, altar kind of thing, ceremonial altar.

58:34.480 --> 58:37.600
Yeah, and you had to make a wish, and you had to push the choo-choo train with the mushrooms

58:37.600 --> 58:38.600
in it.

58:38.600 --> 58:39.600
Yeah, I remember that.

58:39.600 --> 58:40.600
And if it fell over, that was good luck or bad luck.

58:40.600 --> 58:41.600
Oh, yeah!

58:41.600 --> 58:42.600
That all makes sense.

58:42.600 --> 58:43.600
Why do we even need these drugs?

58:43.600 --> 58:44.600
Yeah.

58:44.600 --> 58:45.600
What are we doing?

58:45.600 --> 58:46.600
We're fine!

58:46.600 --> 58:47.600
So, we're fine.

58:47.600 --> 58:48.600
Do zips, abs, up, and hit the town.

58:48.600 --> 58:49.600
Exactly.

58:49.600 --> 58:50.600
So, yeah.

58:50.600 --> 58:51.600
So, three of us...

58:51.600 --> 58:56.600
Yeah, when you're that desperate to have a good time together, you probably will.

58:56.600 --> 58:57.600
All you need?

58:57.600 --> 58:58.600
Yeah.

58:58.600 --> 58:59.600
Ex-body spray.

58:59.600 --> 59:05.240
So, for some reason, we do something really non-intuitive.

59:05.240 --> 59:09.440
We all go to the Hard Rock Casino, which is just a bunch of assholes.

59:09.440 --> 59:10.440
Oh, my God, the worst.

59:10.440 --> 59:14.160
But we stood there in the circle bar in the middle of the casino, and I remember the three

59:14.160 --> 59:15.160
of us...

59:15.160 --> 59:16.160
Why is it called the Circle Bar?

59:16.160 --> 59:18.160
It's a great question.

59:18.160 --> 59:19.160
It's a good question.

59:19.160 --> 59:20.160
Fair question.

59:20.160 --> 59:21.160
Yep.

59:21.160 --> 59:25.600
Uh, because it was named after Jonathan Circle, who discovered it while chasing a bear.

59:25.600 --> 59:29.840
Uh, it's a circular bar in the middle of the casino, which is also a circularly shape.

59:29.840 --> 59:32.240
Didn't we end up calling it like the Shark's Nest or something?

59:32.240 --> 59:33.680
We had some weird name for it.

59:33.680 --> 59:35.160
Yeah, because, well, we...

59:35.160 --> 59:36.160
I had this...

59:36.160 --> 59:39.760
And, like, we stood there like a little triangle facing each other.

59:39.760 --> 59:40.760
At the Circle Bar.

59:40.760 --> 59:41.760
Yeah, right?

59:41.760 --> 59:42.760
Like, like, three squares.

59:42.760 --> 59:45.760
Something's wrong with this picture.

59:45.760 --> 59:48.720
But people kept coming up to us...

59:48.720 --> 59:52.040
Why are you at the Circle Bar if you're in a triangle position?

59:52.040 --> 59:53.280
Do it as Bill Cosby.

59:53.280 --> 59:54.760
Why are you in the...

59:54.760 --> 59:55.760
I can't do it.

59:55.760 --> 59:56.760
All right.

59:56.760 --> 59:57.760
All right.

59:57.760 --> 59:58.760
So...

59:58.760 --> 59:59.760
Excuse me.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.760
No, no, I can't do it.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.760
I'm sorry.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.760
I'm going.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.760
People were...

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:08.160
We were just laughing so hard and finishing each other's sentences, and there were moments

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.080
where we weren't talking at all, and we were just, like, like, making eye contact and

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.960
laughing, and I was like, what did you think I just said?

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.960
Yeah.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.120
And you would say exactly what I thought.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.120
We were all...

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120
It was a good...

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.920
It was a good hive mind going on, for sure.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.920
So this guy came up and he had, like, a bad, like, kind of a shiny shirt he bought at a

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.120
Vegas store, and he kind of looked like he was having a bad night, and, like, he was,

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.760
like, one of the few people that came up to us and said, hey, is it okay if I hang out

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.760
with you guys?

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.760
Oh.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.760
We were like, why?

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.360
Like, because, like, you guys are having so much fun.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.360
We're...

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360
Absolutely.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.360
Like, you can hang out.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.360
So he laughed and laughed and laughed.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.360
Then we stood by the...

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.360
The...

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.360
Near the bathrooms.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.360
Were the trombones in the air?

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.360
Yeah.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.360
Saxophones.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.360
It was...

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.360
There was, like, a chandelier made of saxophones.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.080
And there's a dome, and so, like, you can hear the sounds from across the other side.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080
Oh, yeah.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.280
So if someone's walking that way, their voice hits the dome, and it sounds like they're

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.280
behind you.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.560
You maybe have seen, like, that, like, rotunda, kind of, yeah.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.560
And we're laughing and laughing.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.680
And you were going nuts at this point, you know?

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680
Like...

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.680
It was...

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680
It was six hours of just, like, hysteria.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.240
The thing I was talking about today, because when it came up when you get...

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.360
When I knew what you guys did yesterday, I was at this, you know, barbecue, and drugs

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360
came up.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.360
Not that we had any.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.360
We didn't.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.960
But I talked about mushrooms, and the thing I talked about was that I remember really

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.440
well, people walking to the bathroom, and then them walking out and being able to tell

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.960
so clearly by, like, their aura, their whole vibe that they got, went and did cocaine.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:31.960
Like, I swear to God.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:32.960
It was like...

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.960
It was like...

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.960
Oh, look at...

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.960
Oh, she's pretty cute.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:36.960
Oh, wow.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.960
There you...

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:38.960
Jesus, what did she do?

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.960
Like...

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.960
And nothing...

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:41.960
Nothing visual.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:42.960
It was just, like, this...

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.960
Like, a ramped-up energy that you're like, what was going on?

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.960
And I'm, like, such a bumpkin when it came to that stuff.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.960
And then we just had, like, people that just wanted to be with us and hang out.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.960
Yeah, yeah, we were...

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.960
So happy.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.960
Yeah, we were...

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.960
And we were like...

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:53.960
We were all, like, three Jimmy Stewart's.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.960
We were just like, hey, how you doing?

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.960
Like, anybody that came down...

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960
And then you...

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.640
I mean, you are tall as shit.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.960
Mike was tall as shit and bald, like, you know, like shaved head.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.960
And then...

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960
So I was just...

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960
And I was just in the middle there, you know, point guard, and I was like...

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960
We were just having...

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960
Serving up fucking dishes.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.960
Serving up the high dishes, up top.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960
Yeah.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.960
So I had...

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.960
At this time, I had been to the hard rock probably four or five times in my life before

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:18.960
that.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.960
And so the next time I go there, it's about a year later, and I walk into the circle bar

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.680
and I'm like, oh, this is the place.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.960
And I walk up to the bartender and I said, because this is wooden, like, staircases

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.860
that go up into the circle bar.

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.860
And it was stationary.

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.960
I'm like, when did this stop being a rotating bar?

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.960
And the guy's like, what?

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.960
I go, this used to be a rotating bar.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.960
And he goes, no, I go, oh, shit.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960
Yeah.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.960
Yeah.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.960
Yeah.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.960
I remember it because the lights would always make you feel like you're like...

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:55.960
There'd be a guy that was standing perfectly still, but in my mind, he was going in a circle.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.960
He was orbiting like a planet.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.960
And then he would reappear over there.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.960
I'm like, man, these people just keep spinning around us.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.960
It was so great.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960
My favorite time, you weren't there, but...

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.960
And I hope he doesn't mind me saying this, but I just think it's one of the funniest

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.960
things I've ever seen.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.960
I know the mushrooms help, but I think you have to be able to...

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960
If you've been to Vegas, you can picture this.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:20.960
Dan Backadal, who also did Second City with me in Vegas, a bunch of us got together.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.960
I think Jeremy might have been there.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.960
We were out in front of the Bellagio with those dancing...

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.960
They call them the Dancing Fountains and everything.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.960
And we're all deciding...

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.960
Mushrooms basically is like, especially at Vegas, is like, you go to a pack.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.960
You stand in a circle.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.960
You laugh at all the fucking crazy shit going on around you, above you, behind you, walking by you.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.960
And then you walk for four feet to say, okay, let's go somewhere.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960
You get there and then you're like...

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.960
Then it happens again.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960
You know what I mean?

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.960
That's how we got there.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960
We posted...

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.960
We had two locations, the bar and then the saxophone.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.960
We kind of went back and forth to them.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.960
We were inside the Bellagio and it was like fucking Mark's brothers.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.960
But you also adopt...

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.960
If you're out of mushrooms, you also adopt different...

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.960
It's not just let's go back to the circle bar.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.960
It's like, let's go to the cookie tree.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.960
That's what it was.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.960
The shark tank or whatever it was called.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.960
Everything becomes its own inside joke.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.960
It's like, you're going around the monopoly board multiple times and renaming stuff.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.960
And so there's like a group of six of us and five of us over here.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.960
And then all of a sudden we just turn around and back at all, just watching the fountains.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.960
And we could slowly start to figure out that he's pretending like he's their choreographer.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:37.960
We're all like...

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:42.960
And he's doing it for us, but I think he really was doing it.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.960
It was so brilliant.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.960
And he did it for like the rest of whatever fucking Selena...

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.960
Not Selena Gomez, what's her name?

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960
Celine Dion song at that point.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.960
This was the 70s.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.960
My heart will go on probably.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.960
It probably was.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.960
Yeah, some paparazzi song.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.960
It was so fun.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.960
That town's a mess.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.960
It needs it.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:10.960
What do you guys think about people who are concerned about people doing drugs who don't?

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.960
Because I feel like there are some of them who are concerned about people,

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.960
and that's why they're concerned about people doing drugs.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:23.960
And then I feel like there's the 85% of them that are getting high off of other people's drug use

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.960
and are really happy to be concerned about something.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.960
Like the sanctimony of it?

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.960
Yeah.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:33.960
Like whether they're... Some of those people are recovered and then you kind of go,

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:39.960
okay, so you fought a demon and you're happy about it and now you want that to be your thing.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:45.960
But then still some people, I think there's just a little slice of genuinely evil people

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.960
who have never done it, will never need to do it, have never done anything,

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.960
have never cared about anyone and are kind of feeling the unconscious suspicion

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.960
that maybe they're sociopaths or that they'll never have a connection to anybody.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.960
And that they've found this loophole in society where there's this thing where it's like,

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.960
oh, I'm so concerned about that person.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:10.960
And it's like they found this little shortcut between this little wormhole that society offers

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:17.960
where you can simultaneously be a good person but be the most villainous piece of shit in the world

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:21.960
that doesn't care about anyone and has never done anything nice for anybody.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.960
It's just filled with emotional toxicity and passive aggression.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.960
It just siphons the life force off of everyone around you.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.960
A good sativa would help that, you know?

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:39.960
Just like a little boop, not a boop, a boop, they'd be gone.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:43.960
Yeah, and I think they know that and I think that they feel that that would be annihilation

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:47.960
because it would be eliminating the part of them that is more them than the rest of them.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.960
And I think that they don't like being surrounded with any reminders

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:56.960
that maybe you should just relax and not have that much of an opinion about anybody else.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.960
And they kind of enjoy the fact that statistically speaking,

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.960
sooner or later, people who are okay with drugs,

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.960
statistically speaking, every once in a while one of them dies or has a problem or gets sick.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.960
And I think they kind of fucking love that.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.960
I think they really love that.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.960
I think they love that as much as we, just Western society,

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:21.960
loves the fact that every once in a while a suicide vest goes off prematurely.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.960
We were stoked to hear about that.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.960
And I think there are people who show up at memorials for writers that overdose.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.960
They're there for the same reason I am on the surface,

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.960
but underneath it they're like, this is fucking cool.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.960
I knew I was right.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:37.960
Maybe.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.960
Yeah, I don't know.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.960
And some of those people run shows

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:46.960
and some of those people spread their cult to everyone underneath them and fuck you.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.960
Do they know who they are?

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.960
No, no, no.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.960
Let's keep it that way.

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.960
You can just tell me, you can just address me directly, Dan.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.960
Come on, man.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.960
No, the entire time you were saying that,

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.960
I was thinking about the father from the guy from Footloose,

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.960
who just, if he just danced, if he just tried to dance once.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.960
And he did once at his wedding or something, you know.

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.960
Was that, I never saw Footloose.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.960
No, no, I did, but you never saw Footloose.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:16.960
But you get it.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.960
But you get it.

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.960
Yeah.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960
How have you never seen Footloose?

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:20.960
I don't know.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.960
You know the song though, right?

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:26.960
I haven't seen, what's the, not Goonies, what's the other, I've seen Goonies.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960
What's the other one that?

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960
Star Trek.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.960
The other one, King Kong.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960
No, I haven't seen Goonies.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.960
I saw Gremlins, but I haven't seen Goonies.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:38.960
But Will, this is really weird to me because in your Wikipedia page it said that recently...

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.960
You've seen Goonies.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.960
Recently.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.960
It says in your Wikipedia page you've seen Goonies.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:48.960
I like to get it out there that I've seen Goonies, but it's like a, you got to update that.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.960
Recently you were in a radio play performance.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.960
You're doing something on Broadway now, it's like a radio play that's, it's an adaptation

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.960
of Footloose, isn't it?

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.960
You were...

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:02.960
It's a loose...

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.960
Like it's a...

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960
A loose Footloose?

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.960
Footlooser?

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.960
It's kind of foot, foot, foot tighter.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.960
Foot tighter.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960
Foot tighter because it's still loose.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.960
And the subtitle is a loose interpretation of the Footloose.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.960
Is that a working title or is that a done deal?

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.960
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.960
Is it alright if we do, if we do a scene from, from that?

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.960
Yeah.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.960
Like, like, like...

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:23.960
Sure.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.960
You play the Kevin Bacon role, Thaddeus foot.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960
Yes.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:34.960
Um, and uh, well let's, like, like, like, like, you guys are off book, right?

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.960
Yeah, but it's only because I've seen it a bunch.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:37.960
Right.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:38.960
Schrab, you know the performance we're talking about.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.960
I'm not studied in it.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.960
I might pass out.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.960
Yeah?

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.960
I don't feel really good right now.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.960
What's, what's wrong?

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.960
No, we're starting the show, right?

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.960
Oh...

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.960
Oh.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.960
Shit, this is...

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.960
Maybe...

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:54.960
I...

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.960
You just need to dance.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.960
Oh, this, by the way, this is, um, they do this amazing thing in the show where, like,

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.960
if you're sitting in the audience, this is happening two seats down from you.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.960
This is like a thing that happens.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.960
I will never...

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.960
Mark my words.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.960
I will never, ever, ever dance.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.960
Period.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.960
Uh...

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960
That's the end.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.960
Oh, yeah.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.960
That's the end.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960
Yeah.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960
Isn't that quick?

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960
That's the end of the show?

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:27.960
We did not get good reviews.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.960
Yeah.

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.960
That is true.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.960
I gotta test that.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.960
Wait, so the show starts with two people, the audience doing that, and that's the end

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.960
of the show?

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:36.960
Yep.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.960
Oh yeah, easy to say now.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.960
Yeah.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.960
It sounds stupid when you say it.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:47.960
I will say the production budget is so inexpensive that it actually kind of makes money.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.960
Yeah, it's the always sunny in Philadelphia of Broadway shows.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:55.960
It's like, it's the most profitable Broadway show in America on Broadway.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.960
Yeah, we don't even need a stage.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:02.960
It's brilliantly conceived, but I don't know, I just have a hard time when people finally

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:03.960
get to see something.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.960
All the work that went into that.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.960
And then for you, just the chip away at it.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.960
It's like, you know what I mean, it's easy to do now.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.960
I just feel like it had first, second, and third act problems.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:21.960
Yeah, no, I don't disagree there, but still, you know.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.960
Do you remember the Goonies show that you were in?

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.960
That was a longer time ago.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:28.960
I do remember.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.960
Never feed them after midnight.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.960
Do not get them wet.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:40.960
And a third thing.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.960
But it's probably been discussed, I'm sure, on this exact show.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.960
But when can they start feeding them again if it's after midnight?

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.960
Well, isn't that answered in this scene from the Goonies play that you guys did?

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.960
When Dan is trying to express to you guys, he wants to do some improv right now.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:58.960
Oh shit, that was that.

01:11:58.960 --> 01:11:59.960
Oh shit.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.960
It's too seamless.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.960
It goes right by me.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:04.960
You're off duty.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:05.960
You're off duty.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.960
I mean, I'm not explicit about it.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.960
Jason and Will, what you guys don't know is that Harmontown over the years,

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.960
we're nearing our, is this our 199th episode?

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960
Is that true?

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.960
Yeah.

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.960
Wow.

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.960
There we go.

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.960
Here we go, everybody.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.960
199 episodes.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.960
Chris and it, we got to break it over the-

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.960
Right in this bottle.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:34.960
What, this show's, as much as a show used to be a kind of a,

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.960
kind of a haphazard, loose, rambling thing,

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:45.960
we, I think we can say that we're one of the greatest long form improv shows of all time.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:54.960
It's, we do some of the most well crafted storytelling character driven long form improv.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.960
What was the suggestion, indulgence?

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.960
It was indulgence and goonies.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:02.960
It was.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:03.960
It was goonies too.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.960
It's nice we finally got back to it.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.960
Yeah.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960
People love that.

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.960
Did the person that suggested, still here?

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:09.960
2011.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.960
I'd like to take this moment to thank Jane for bringing me a special absence, by the way.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:14.960
Ooh.

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.960
Oh yeah.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.960
Do you guys want to try some of this?

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.960
This shit gets you high.

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.960
Is it a real deal?

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960
It's a real deal.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.960
The wormwood gets in the brain.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.960
You see the gritting fairy.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.960
Jane, did you make this glass too?

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.960
I commissioned it.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.960
You commissioned the glass?

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.960
Jane works at Corning Institute, right?

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:32.960
Corning Glassworks.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.960
Corning Glassworks.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.960
She's the Tony Stark of glass blowing.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:36.960
Technology.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.960
And she said she has a gift for us.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:40.960
He's got half of it.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.960
Do you want to present, do you want to present that gift now?

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.960
It seems like a good time.

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.960
Oh, look at this.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:45.960
Oh.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:46.960
It's beautiful tumblers.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.960
Can you, do you want to explain it?

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.960
Explain it.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.960
It's a glass.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.960
It's a sodium calcium silicate.

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.960
No.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.960
Can you be more specific?

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.960
Twenty-eight percent calcium oxide.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.960
Believe me, I can do it.

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.960
Sorry.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.960
At what temperature do those two elements bond together and form glass?

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:09.960
Fahrenheit or centigrade?

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.960
Let's go centigrade.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.960
Oh, gosh, no, let's do Fahrenheit.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.960
Come on, I'm the guest.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.960
I'm bi, I can do both.

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.960
Yeah, but thank you.

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.960
Give us both, but put them in whatever order you want.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.960
2150 Fahrenheit.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.960
2150.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.960
That's when you get everything all melted in.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.960
You can gather it and work it.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:30.960
2150.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.960
About, yeah, about 1150 centigrade or Celsius, I should say.

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.960
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.960
So, yeah, so I, you've got the double rocks.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.960
You've got the single rocks glass.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.960
These were designed, I designed them.

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.960
So based on, perfect.

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:44.960
That's what it's for.

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:45.960
Well done.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:46.960
It works.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.960
But so there's supposed to be sort of a mash-up of a classic rocks glass with the solo cup,

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.960
which is sort of one of the symbols of Harmontown.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.960
That's awesome.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.960
So in honor of the 200th episode for Jeff and Dan,

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.960
he's got the absent of Malice.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.960
Take a big swing out that will, because we had a guest when we were in New York,

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.960
Rory, what was Rory's last name, Dan?

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.960
Albanese.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.960
Yeah, yeah, Albanese.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.960
And he got, he lost his fucking mind.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.960
He did.

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.960
He went completely bonkers.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.960
Rory was drinking it like Welch's Grape Soda.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.960
Yeah, he was going at it.

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.960
At some point, I just took the bottle away from him.

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.960
It was like, no, no, no, no, no.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.960
I want to taste it.

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.960
Dan's also got the earth shine.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:31.960
The original that I brought in episode 7800 and how many episodes ago.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:32.960
Latest version.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.960
It's actually not 135 proof now.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.960
I've dropped it down to about 110.

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.960
So you can actually drink it.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.960
Oh.

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.960
Cheers.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.960
Also, what I love, David.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.960
The olive oil.

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.960
No, no.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.960
That's the absence of Malice.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.960
You take this, you infuse it with warm wood and about 15 or 20 other things.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.960
Distill it again.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.960
Add some more color to it.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.960
And so that's homemade absence.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.960
That's just homemade.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.960
If you're listening at home right now, start a podcast.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.960
People just start making you booze.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.960
It's amazing.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.960
Yeah.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.960
It's what I'm here for.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.960
It's called The Secret.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.960
I found my place.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.960
These glasses are gorgeous.

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.960
Thank you so much.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960
That's amazing.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.960
Hey, Jane, thank you.

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:21.960
Jane says, I'm done with Sergio.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.960
Treats me like a rag doll.

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:27.960
Nineties.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:33.960
I was into Jane's addiction and Phil Collins at the exact same time.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.960
I was a master of both worlds.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.960
That's your duality.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.960
That's like your Batman Bruce Wayne.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:43.960
All right.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:51.960
Well, so yeah, I was trying to pimp us to do a little improv thing because you're both

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.960
so talented, but it didn't work out that way.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:55.960
Oh, I fucked up.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:56.960
I fucked up.

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:57.960
I didn't know that.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:58.960
It's not you guys.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:16:59.960
I didn't know you wanted more than that.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.960
It's really, it's mostly Schrab who knows better.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.960
I mean, the only reason I started doing it is because Schrab started doing it.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.960
Like, I never wanted to do that in this show.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.960
And then Schrab would come on and he's delightful and he would like go into these dumb sketches.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.960
You think I'm delightful, Dan?

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:22.960
Here this whole time, I thought you didn't think about me like that.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:27.960
I thought, I thought, I thought you thought it was a fucking piece of shit.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.960
Anyways, here's, here's Will Forte's Goonies play.

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:40.960
We're going to do a scene from it that's premiering next week on Broadway at 9.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:51.960
Douglas, Douglas, it's 7.58 a.m. and the Goonies very hungry.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:52.960
Give them some to eat.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:53.960
There's a half a sandwich in the fridge.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.960
I got to go to work.

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.960
How do we know what time is the appropriate save time?

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.960
I guess we got to pop in the movie.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.960
There's no need to pop in the movie.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:10.960
I told you after midnight, I'm the one that gave you that movie.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:16.960
Claudius Johnson, Tyrell Blackman.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.960
Thanks, Claudius.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.960
But Claudius, hear me out here.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:30.960
Even if it's 11.58 p.m., it's 23 hours and 58 minutes after midnight.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.960
He makes a good point, Claudius.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.960
I got to go to work.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:37.960
Y'all thinking with that ass burger brain.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:38.960
Claudius.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.960
You got to feel the Goonie rules.

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:45.960
Feel him in your heart and your mind will follow.

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.960
Magical Blackman trope away!

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.960
Claudius, Douglas, something's happening to me inside.

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.960
I'm feeling something.

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.960
The left part of my body, upper part, by my chest.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:00.960
What's wrong?

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.960
It's beneath my rib cage.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.960
Blood's pumping through it.

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.960
Your heart?

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.960
That must be it!

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:12.960
Oh, buddy, that's okay.

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.960
Everyone's got a heart.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.960
Nothing you got to be worried about.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:19.960
You got to get to work.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.960
I hope it's not work.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:23.960
Hello?

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.960
What the fuck?

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.960
When are you getting to work here?

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.960
These newspapers are piled up to the ceiling.

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:30.960
Will you get over here?

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.960
I can't even get out of my office.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.960
I can't get out of my office with all these newspapers piled up to the ceiling.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.960
Extra, extra.

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960
Oh, where should I put this one?

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.960
Hey, I'm on the phone.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.960
I'll just put it on top of this big pile.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.960
Now they're past the ceiling.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:59.960
Hey, what...

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.960
I really got to go.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.960
Maybe if...

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.960
Look, look, we really got to figure this out.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.960
I'd love to.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:07.960
Hang on.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.960
Scar is 69.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:10.960
Hello?

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.960
Hi, yeah.

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.960
Douglas is...

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:14.960
Be careful.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.960
It's my own source of income.

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:16.960
Who is this?

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:17.960
I'm a busy man.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:18.960
Oh, shit.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.960
See?

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:21.960
Lot easier, right?

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:22.960
Lot easier than you'd think.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.960
And then you get in there and your whole mind goes nuts.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.960
He's intimidating, but he pays so well.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.960
I know.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.960
By the way, friggin' Star 69 still works.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.960
God.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.960
Why do you think this is my only source of income?

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.960
Because my prank phone call albums don't sell anymore.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.960
Because I can't make them.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.960
Look, maybe...

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:49.960
Maybe we can kiss this away.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.960
What?

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:51.960
What are you talking about?

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:52.960
I touch you once.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.960
I touch you twice.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:59.960
I can't show with work with all that lipstick on my face.

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960
People will think I'm a tramp.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:02.960
No, I hate that.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:03.960
Don't show up to work.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:09.960
Show up to the wedding altar.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:14.960
Are you trying to tell me that you're going to spend your father's fortune on our life?

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:25.960
I can't think of another thing that would be more worthy of that $750.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:31.960
Well, then I think on the way to the chapel, we go kill that son of a bitch.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:38.960
That's why I love you.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:47.960
Meanwhile, I will always love you.

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:51.960
I will always love you.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.960
And the fountains are going like this.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.960
And the fountains are like that.

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.960
And Dan Backadall is doing the choreography.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:03.960
And the mushrooms are going...

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.960
Is everybody on their phone?

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.960
What's going on?

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:06.960
No, we were watching.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.960
We were enraptured.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.960
I feel like a good edit point.

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:10.960
I don't know.

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:11.960
Oh, oh, oh.

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.960
Meanwhile, in Buddy's heart...

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.960
I represent anger.

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.960
I represent satisfaction.

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:29.960
And I'm John Lovitz.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.960
Buddy's not satisfied anymore.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.960
That's the ticket.

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.960
Let's make him feel like dancing.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:43.960
Outside, Buddy.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:44.960
Yeah, yeah, you were...

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.960
I'm Douglas, your buddy.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.960
Oh.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:53.960
You know, sometimes when I don't take my medication, I forget my name and such.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.960
Yeah, that's why you gotta take it every morning and night.

01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:56.960
Buddy?

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.960
Buddy, it's your father.

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:04.960
I overheard you talking about killing me and taking my fortune.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960
Sir, that was mostly me.

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.960
I gotta be honest.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.960
Oh, Douglas!

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.960
I never thought you two were a good match.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.960
I just wanted to let you know one thing.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:18.960
There's a dance competition tonight.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.960
Buddy, Douglas.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.960
Buddy's father.

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:27.960
This is your father.

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:28.960
Oh, shit.

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:33.960
I overheard you talking to Buddy and Douglas about the dance contest.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.960
Yes, Daddy.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960
I thought you...

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.960
I thought you died decades ago.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.960
Death is a figment.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.960
Time is man's enemy.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:49.960
Oh, I gotta go to work.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:55.960
You will go to work if you and I switch places.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.960
Because I'm jealous of your youth.

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:03.960
And you need to learn about acumen.

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:07.960
Okay, but I mean, should I just like switch outfits so you want to go to work for me?

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.960
That sounds awesome.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.960
I will tell you this.

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:10.960
It won't work that way.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.960
Dad?

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:12.960
Yeah, hold on.

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.960
Dad, I overheard you talking about switching places with my son.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:19.960
You know, we have a goonie in the basement.

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:20.960
If you think...

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.960
Oh, fuck it. I'm just gonna feed him.

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.960
Oh, no. No!

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.960
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:34.960
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.960
Slamming.

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.960
Brazz, that's our tank.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:37.960
We need a machine gun!

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:38.960
Oh, no. A machine gun.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.960
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:41.960
Me-na, me-n-mine-mine.

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:42.960
What have you done?

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:43.960
Me-n-mine-mine-mine.

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.960
What have you done?

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:45.960
You got this?

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:46.960
Buddy...

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:53.960
Oh, come on.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.960
Oh, come on.

01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:00.960
Oh, come on.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:06.960
Oh, don't you fools know that if you feed a goonie any time after midnight, even if

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.960
it's in the PM of the next day, that their nipples start to shoot laser beams?

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.960
But it's not the PM of the next day.

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.960
It's 8.02 AM.

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.960
Oh, shit.

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.960
Woof-woof-woof-woof-woof!

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.960
Ow!

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.960
Ow!

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.960
Ow!

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.960
Ow!

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.960
Ow!

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.960
Oh, my ass!

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.960
Buddy, what did you do?

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:38.960
Why did you feed me?

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.960
I fed him.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.960
Sweeties.

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.320
Sweeties, I'm a fat piece of shit now.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.640
I'm so sad.

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.000
Oh no, now he's all body conscious.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.360
Later at the dance contest.

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.160
All right, everybody, it's the big dance contest.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.640
You know the rules, best dancer wins,

01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:59.560
everybody else dies.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:04.560
Oh, shit, I broke my leg earlier.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:10.600
Dancing doesn't require legs, it requires a spirit.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:16.720
Ow, you're doing it, buddy, you're doing it.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:23.840
Ow, oh my God, Brenda, look at Buddy dancing with that goonie.

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.840
They're amazing.

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.520
I'm a fat piece of shit.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:34.680
Ow, I don't know how long I have to dance for.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.240
The rules were unspecified.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.480
Don't worry about the rules.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.560
Ow, just dance.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.680
Whatever happens, happens.

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:48.000
Douglas, how did you get out of the dancing competition?

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Work.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:59.800
I declare a winner.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.400
Two winners, to be exact.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.680
But as you know, the rules can only be one winner.

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.560
Everyone else dies.

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:18.200
It's a dance off between the goonie and Buddy.

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.720
Who goes first?

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.120
Buddy.

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.920
Fuck.

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.720
It's okay, buddy, just set the table.

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.480
Just set the table and there's nothing you can do

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.840
once you set the table.

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:39.640
Douglas, that's a great idea.

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:49.480
Clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank,

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.480
clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank.

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.480
Forks go on the left side.

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:54.080
You can remember that because it's four letters in fork and on left.

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:57.680
Spoons go on the right, knives go on the right.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:01.360
He's doing it perfect and he's never been at a restaurant.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.360
What is he doing?

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.720
He's setting the table.

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:07.200
Whatever he's doing, he's doing it good.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.720
Oh no, Claudia's black man.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.480
I'm out of here.

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:19.480
I've been noted as a trope.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.480
I set the table, Douglas.

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.480
I set the table.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.880
I felt like I participated in some way.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.000
You were there the whole time with my fucking heart.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.320
All right, cats and kitty, you just saw a buddy set the table.

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.320
Now it's time for the final course.

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:40.000
We got the goonies.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.400
Eat shit and die.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:47.600
I told you not to feed me.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:52.280
Holy shit, he's eating from the table that got set by body.

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.080
I've never seen anything like it.

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.120
And I put shit on the plates.

01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:58.120
He's literally eating shit.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.520
I wonder if he'll die.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.820
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa.

01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:07.600
Oh, sunlight, CG.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:12.720
A crucifix logo.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.800
The Lamb of God.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.120
Ecclesias 117.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.840
And I saw a man on a horse.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.280
And his sword was justice.

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:31.480
For he who shall not let him in the door shall need for nothing.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:45.720
I am Tetsuo.

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.320
I think we have a winner, everybody.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.800
The winner is the goonie.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.240
Oh, man.

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.240
I can't believe that Goonie-

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.240
That's right.

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.240
That's right.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.240
The winner.

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:56.240
You all thought I couldn't do it.

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.240
And I did it.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:58.240
Where's the trophy?

01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.240
You're all fucking dead.

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.240
Give it to me.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.240
Give me the trophy.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.240
Here's your trophy, goonie.

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:07.240
There's one thing you might want to think about.

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:12.720
Bruce Willis, what are you doing here?

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:16.840
Making trophies out of silver.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.840
Goonies hate silver.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:32.720
Yeah, buddy, make him deep throat the trophy.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:36.400
Yeah.

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:39.600
Finish.

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.940
Finish.

01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:44.640
Finish.

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:45.640
Finish.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.640
Finish.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.640
Finish.

01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:48.640
Finish.

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:49.640
Finish.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:59.000
It's a new way that you use it, come and it goes, it's a new way that you use it.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Wow.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Wow.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000
That's a good movie.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:08.320
And that was on Broadway, and that was one scene, and we were just reading it.

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:09.320
That's great.

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.320
I'm going to go see that.

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.840
The thrill, the thrill of live theater, you know?

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:13.840
What a rush.

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:15.480
Man, oh man.

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.840
They say it's dead.

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.520
No one's more bummed out than Piven.

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.520
No friggin' Tonys.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:23.200
Zero Tony nominations.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:28.040
Not a single person that votes for the Tonys came to see it, it slapped in the face.

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.400
It's a rigged system, the Tonys.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:36.000
We did use a Tony Tony Tony song in it, so that was kind of, we did get three times.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
It feels good.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
That's the one.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Yeah.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
That was it.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.080
What happened to Tony Tony Tony?

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.080
This little, this little doing show?

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.080
No, Cersei.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.080
I don't know.

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:53.200
Well, you know how early silent movie stars were, like the talkies came, and if they had

01:31:53.200 --> 01:32:00.160
speech impediments, they didn't make the translation, Tony Tony Tony clearly not a search bar, iTunes

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.960
compatible band.

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.720
What spelling of Tony are you going to type in first?

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.720
You don't know.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.360
You're going to type in T-O-N, and hope it comes up in the fucking list.

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:14.840
What you should do is change it into three different versions of Tony, if each Tony

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.840
was a different version.

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:17.840
That's why they're...

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.840
Right there.

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:19.840
Yeah.

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:20.840
Isn't one of them Raphael Siddiq?

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:25.920
I think one of those guys might be, that doesn't go on and have a very nice solo career,

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:26.920
I think.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:27.920
What happened to...

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.480
Also, you got your Bell Biff DeVos.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.040
What happened to the Bells and the Biffs?

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.040
Spending money, man.

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.640
They made a lot of money there to spend it.

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:37.800
Was Top 40 music, I guess that was Top 40 music, it was like playing during the dances

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:43.560
where I go to school, I'm like, I suddenly was all, it was all about sex, like I'm not

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:51.200
saying, I mean, obviously as the future continues, the music, it gets more and more sexual.

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:56.080
But it seemed like back then, it was like, I'm remembering when I was 16 to 18, it seemed

01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:02.360
like every song on the radio was just about, it was only just, it was just like, all that,

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:07.760
like that song was like, if the rhythm feels good to the baby, let me hear you, ah, baby.

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:10.480
It was like an orgasm used as an instrument.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:15.920
And then that poison song, it was like, yeah, it was like everything was doom-y and sweating.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.840
That's what happens when bodies start slapping.

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:28.520
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna sex you up, girl, I'll make you feel my death,

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:39.000
erecting gorge with all my blood, insert it into the corresponding hole, that's how babies

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.200
get made.

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.200
Yeah, exactly.

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.080
There's a lot of safe sex songs too.

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.680
It's weird because at that time, sex was, was a very dangerous thing.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:52.200
Yep, it was dangerous as it was ever gonna get, and it was like, we don't have to take

01:33:52.200 --> 01:34:00.200
a close-off, close-off, close-off, close-off, close-off, close-off, close-off, close-off.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:03.880
That was me, that was me acting like I know how to harmonize, no, but I mean, what was

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:07.840
that, I never said a real song, we don't have to take a close-off, close-off, close-off,

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.480
close-off, close-off, close-off.

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.360
I don't remember that one!

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:21.400
We could just play a board game, meet your parents, and be a tribe.

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.760
It's all about over-the-pants hand job.

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.060
doing the running man?

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:29.560
the best kind, because you never have to find out what's inside.

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.560
Jason, how many minutes front to back do you think you spent on camera, on SNL,ICO

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:34.980
Jason, how many minutes front to back do you think you spent on camera, on SNL, doing

01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:35.980
the Running Man?

01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:43.740
I bet if you add it up together, it's going to seem like a lot more just in perception,

01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:46.540
but I bet it's probably 12 minutes, and it was exhausting.

01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:50.420
Because I have a real bone to pick with this whole new Running Man challenge.

01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:53.460
I don't like new generations taking things.

01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:58.020
I gave hashtag away that was pound when I was a kid, we gave it away, but the Running

01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:01.340
Man challenge, which I love, I love the song, I love the spirit behind it, but it's not

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:02.340
the Running Man.

01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:03.340
I just want to put that on record.

01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:06.340
I just want to put that on record.

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:07.840
What is the Running Man challenge?

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:13.460
The Running Man challenge is that it's to that great song, I forget who sings it, but

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:18.420
it's like a kid started in a high school, and it's them dancing, and then now college

01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:22.100
basketball teams did it, and it hasn't hit like water bucket challenge level, and there's

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:23.900
no charity attached to it whatsoever.

01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:29.140
People are just like, let's get these diseases out of the way, I challenge you to eat a candy

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.140
bar.

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:31.140
It's just the young, exactly young.

01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:32.140
For who?

01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:33.140
For me.

01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:34.140
For me.

01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:35.140
For friendship.

01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:36.140
For your tummy.

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:37.140
You're starving.

01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:38.140
For hunger.

01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:42.300
You know it's a bummer, a friend of mine hangs out at our local bar in the drawing room,

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:46.860
he's an editor, and he said, hey Jeff, if you're free over the next couple days, I want

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:52.220
you to be in this, I need a couple of extra clips for this music video that I'm editing,

01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:55.580
and it's like a silly song, but I think it's going to be pretty big.

01:35:55.580 --> 01:36:02.060
I'm like, yeah, I don't know, it sounds dumb, and he sent me this clip, he sent me a clip

01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:06.100
of what I have to do, like it's a dance I have to do, I'm like, I don't know, and so

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:09.860
I said, some friends of mine, they should be in it, and they were in it, and he's like,

01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:13.940
I think you should be in it, it'd be really funny to have you in it, and what it was was

01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:18.940
the watch me whip, watch me nae nae video, and I could have been in that stupid piece

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.660
of shit.

01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:24.660
How funny would that be just for me in a suit, just doing the whip or the nae nae, I don't

01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:30.540
know what it is, I'm behind, I don't know what it is, it's like, it's insert, you remember

01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:34.500
what the Macarena was, like you're a structure guy, like it's like just extrapolate.

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:39.100
Well, yeah, but that's how you become a curmudgeon is by saying, sounds like another Macarena.

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.100
No.

01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:47.140
Well, only if this is just the shadow again, the Star Wars, not remembering how much joy

01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:52.340
the Macarena gave you, especially you, you have no me specifically, yes, I called you

01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:53.340
about it.

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:57.420
Yeah, because it was the morning, I don't know what to do, and it wasn't even weird

01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:01.940
to get a phone call, that's how long ago it was, and I was like, yeah, man, I know it's

01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:05.140
pretty intense, and, and I think it made you, you said it made you feel like you went to

01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:07.500
spring break, even though you never got to go to spring break or something, whatever

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:12.940
it was, that joy that you had at that point, people are whipping in Naina and getting that

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:13.940
joy.

01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:22.420
All right, no, I did, I went to visit my parents in Florida once, only once, well, one time

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:28.660
too many, ah, that's a crazy family, they should be on TV, the Harmons.

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:29.660
We wouldn't call it Harmontown?

01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:30.660
No, why would you?

01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:40.300
No, no, no, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not cutting up this pie any more slices, ah, this shit's

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:41.300
solid gold, maybe.

01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:45.260
You think I watched Sony Crackle get in a piece of this action?

01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:51.740
Um, the, the, ah, the Macarena, I went to visit my parents in Florida when the Macarena

01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:55.940
was popular, and there was this, it's Florida, so, and they lived in this like kind of community

01:37:55.940 --> 01:38:00.260
for old people, my parents were like, they would go to like early bird dinners and stuff,

01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:04.940
and there was this, there was this sort of big wooden deck, and there was a woman with

01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:08.980
a boom box, and there was a bunch of old people, they were all learning the Macarena, and I,

01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:14.940
I was like, this is my chance to learn the Macarena without any concern about anything.

01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:20.460
If anything, I'm like, ah, no matter how awkward I am, I'm still like Jamie Lee Curtis in

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:23.420
perfect, you know, like I'm still our John Travolta, like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,

01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:25.420
There's a good chance you're going to pick it up before the other, right?

01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:26.420
Yeah, where is this?

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:30.620
It's just like, no one's going to beat me up, and if anyone makes fun of me, I'll push

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:36.500
them over and run, and, and so I, I, you know, my then girlfriend and I, like, like, like

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:40.660
we learned the Macarena, and it was fun, I understand the cultural, I don't need to sign

01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:46.620
off on the cultural efficacy of popular songs, it's there, but what's this whip, whip, my

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:47.620
name, name?

01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:49.500
I don't know how to do it, it's, it ends like this.

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.660
Whip, whip, my name, name, whip, my name, name,

01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:55.660
But my friend Rich, who edited the video, he sent me this clip of the guy, what's his

01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:56.660
name?

01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:57.660
I don't even know the...

01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:58.660
I don't remember.

01:38:58.660 --> 01:38:59.660
Cilento.

01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:00.660
Cilento.

01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:01.660
And he sent me this clip.

01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:05.140
He served with your food, but it tastes like soap.

01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:06.940
I think I, I think I still have this clip.

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:11.900
It's Cilento talking straight to camera, saying, alright, there's a bunch of dances in this

01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:15.260
one, this one's called the whip, and this one's called the nae nae, and so he shows them

01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:19.660
all, and one's called, watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me, okay,

01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:23.460
the next one's called, don't watch me, don't watch me, like, it's just like, it went on

01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:25.780
forever and I was like, this guy looks like a lunatic.

01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:26.980
I think you have that clip.

01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:30.620
Would you press play on that clip right now, Jeff, and press play on that clip?

01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:31.980
I think we have it right now.

01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:32.980
I think we have it.

01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:34.780
Oh, oh yeah, I do.

01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:35.780
Play.

01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:40.780
Uh, Forte, do it.

01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:52.260
Alright, he sent the table, he sent the table, oh god.

01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:58.340
Set that, set that, set that table, the table, set that, set that, set that, set that table.

01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:01.340
Well I just, yeah.

01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:10.940
Oh, he's going upstairs, oh, he forgot something, he's climbing a ladder, he's going, where's

01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:11.940
he going?

01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:15.740
Oh, he's going around, oh shit, oh no, oh no, he's a bear, he's a bear, he's a bear, oh

01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:21.780
god, oh god, he's, no, he doesn't know what to do, he's calling, he's calling the phone,

01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:24.780
hello, there's a bear over there, there's got to do something, he's getting out the

01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:27.980
belt, he's calling on a different phone, he's got to talk to me on a different phone, now

01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:34.140
he's talking on the other phone, he's got a bear, land land, you hold on, hold on, there's

01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:40.060
a bear, just take it easy, okay, now here's the thing, you need to understand, I'm not,

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:47.060
oh shit, I got the phone, I can't believe I got the phone, I need to call that guy back,

01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:51.740
there's a bear, he's going everywhere, there's a bear, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:55.820
I, who, who will I be able to call that'll make anything happen about this bear, I'm

01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:00.580
standing in a tower, I crawled up to the top of it, I can see the bear, I've got two phones,

01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:04.940
I shouldn't need to do more than this, I've seen the bear, I, I, I, there's got to be

01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:09.580
something I can do, I've got to get through to these people, wait, I'm yelling, I'm yelling,

01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:17.460
I'm hanging up, I, I, I, I'm just sitting down, I'm crying, ah, the bear, the bear's

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:23.580
gone, he's gone, well, oh, he's, he's got more bears with him, I got to call both phones

01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:28.580
now, alright, I'm telling you, there's, there's multiple bears, there's a bear problem out

01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:41.260
here, I can't, tear God in heaven, why, oh, I destroyed my phone, I'm becoming bear, oh,

01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:46.300
wait, oh, no, okay, well there's, nope, that phone's broken, I can't use that one anymore,

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:50.600
alright, okay, I'm lighting that bear, the phone on fire, I'm, I'm putting a basket

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:57.500
over it, and I, I, I'm making smoke signals, inside the hut, and, and, and, and, and it's

01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:02.540
signaling the bears, hey bears, bears, if there's smoke in the air, that means that you should

01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:07.180
go up in the sky, because there's probably salmon up there, and everyone loves smoked

01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:15.700
salmon, yay, ah, there they go, they're all leaving, I did it right, time to pick up these

01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:24.700
hot coals, and just play with them in my palm, ow, god damn it, that hurt, and, and, and,

01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:34.860
yeah, and I, I, I feel like, I just meant like, I thought you were going to do the voice

01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:43.380
of the guy that was going to do the nae nae and do the shi- I was, I was doing the, right,

01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:47.140
you know, you were doing the actual nae nae and stuff, yeah, because now like, the, the

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:52.140
Macarena was back in the 90s, the dances now are a lot more complicated, they tell a whole

01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:58.740
story now, yeah, did you guys, did you guys do that bear hunt when you were kids in the,

01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:03.380
uh, uh, like pre-kindergarten and daycare center, like, like, like, like we're going

01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:07.540
on a bear hunt, and there was a thing, you would crawl a tree, and then you would look,

01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:11.540
I think you'd call it crawling a tree, I totally forgot about that, yeah, you'd turn the lights

01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:18.740
off, and everybody would unbuckle their pants, and then, and then, and then he would pre-

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:25.240
found one, found one, I found a bear, found a bear, found a bear, found a bear, found

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.980
a bear, found a bear, found a bear, found a bear, I remember when, when I was in pre-school,

01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:33.100
uh, uh, you know, I was like, maybe just four years old, and no, no one teaches you how

01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:36.900
to play doctor, but we, we actually like, when, when the teacher left the class, we,

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:40.100
We got Gloria something rather, I forget her last name.

01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:42.020
She volunteered to take her clothes off

01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:43.060
late under the teacher's desk

01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:44.900
and all of the men in the classroom were surgeons.

01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:47.700
Well, if you just remember her lawyer's name, we can call him.

01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.540
For real?

01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:50.900
You forgot her last name.

01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:52.900
Gloria, I forgot her last name.

01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:53.900
We assaulted her.

01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:54.900
Gloria.

01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:55.900
Gloria.

01:43:55.900 --> 01:44:00.900
So, she had all of her clothes off?

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:04.180
She took her clothes off and me and Jeffrey Kim,

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:06.700
who's a Korean kid, he and I were like the two surgeons.

01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:10.700
Why do you have to say his race?

01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:15.700
Well, it comes into play.

01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:19.700
It fucking better.

01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:23.700
You're going to want to know he was Korean.

01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:27.700
What goes down?

01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:30.700
But it was just like the kids exploring each other's body.

01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:33.700
It was totally alright.

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:34.700
This was preschool?

01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:35.700
Pre-school.

01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:36.700
Yeah.

01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:41.700
That's good, because that really explained why we need to know he was Korean.

01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.700
It really came into play.

01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:45.700
It definitely came into play.

01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:48.700
I mean, so I'm fucking Jeffrey Kim and I mean,

01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:50.700
I mean fucking him.

01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:52.700
Korean style.

01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:53.700
Oh, there you go.

01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:55.700
Okay, okay.

01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:58.700
There you go.

01:44:58.700 --> 01:44:59.700
And the teacher comes back.

01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:00.700
I found the Elmer's.

01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:02.700
What the fuck is going on here?

01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:03.700
Stop fucking Jeffrey Kim.

01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:06.700
Get that out of Jeffrey Kim right now.

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:09.700
And put it in these.

01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:13.700
So Jeffrey Kim starts fucking the teacher.

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:16.700
It was fucking, it was way out of hand, man.

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:18.700
That was the 70s, man.

01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:19.700
It was the 70s.

01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.700
My principal's name was Mr. Fromgan.

01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:27.700
And I'm okay using that name because I would love to go to court

01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:30.700
and talk about what an asshole he was.

01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:33.700
And he would, he loved drills.

01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:37.700
He loved, like, like, yeah, like, well, no, no, not power jokes.

01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:41.700
Like, he had a, he had a hand crank siren,

01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:42.700
but it was supposed to be mounted.

01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:43.700
It had screw holes on it.

01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.700
You could see it was supposed to be mounted on a counter,

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.700
but he would, he would walk around going.

01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:53.700
Why would he make the noise if he had the drill?

01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:58.700
That's like having a cow and going.

01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:00.700
The sound that comes out of the thing is so great, too.

01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:01.700
It's a waste.

01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:04.700
But there were tornado drills, fire drills, tornado drills.

01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:06.700
And there were bomb drills.

01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:10.700
And bomb drills were funny back then because bomb drills meant

01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:13.700
you should grow a Mohawk because World War III is happening.

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:16.700
Like, the Russians have launched 47,000 missiles.

01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:19.700
At Brown Deer, Wisconsin.

01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:22.700
Gotta take out that Brown Deer, Wisconsin.

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:24.700
Now it's come full circle where bomb drill means,

01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:26.700
holy shit, a kid brought a fucking bomb to school.

01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:28.700
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:29.700
It's not funny at all.

01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:32.700
That, the hashtag, the running man, I'm telling you.

01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:33.700
Oh well.

01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:36.700
But he would also, he would take us into the unfinished area

01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:38.700
or basement of the school and explain to us.

01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:39.700
Turn off the lights.

01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:42.700
Like, whether or not we had survived the tornado or fire

01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:43.700
or bomb in question.

01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:46.700
But I remember the beginnings of the drills would be like

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.700
line up boy girl, boy girl, like, like,

01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:49.700
That seems silly.

01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:50.700
Like the gender.

01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:52.700
These will be your mates.

01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:53.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.700
Their job is to repopulate the planet.

01:46:56.700 --> 01:47:00.700
Sperm providers and patty cake makers.

01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:02.700
Will be the foundation of our new society.

01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:06.700
Tornadoes are repelled by glass ceilings.

01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:09.700
Bombs bounce off of them.

01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:15.700
Gender dichotomy will be our new weapon against the mutants.

01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:18.700
We had to, we were like two blocks away from our neighborhoods,

01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:23.700
tornado siren in Kansas and it was frightening.

01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:26.700
The screen, the sky had turned like green, like legit green.

01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:28.700
And it would be the stillness.

01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:30.700
And then the siren would start and we'd go look at the window.

01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:33.700
And you mean my younger sisters would be like, oh God.

01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:35.700
And then we'd have to go down, run down the basement.

01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:36.700
You lived in tornado world.

01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:37.700
Yeah, yeah.

01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:39.700
It was like, like the fucking movie that showed on once a year

01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:42.700
that like where tornadoes were famous in Kansas.

01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:43.700
When tornadoes were famous.

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:44.700
Yo.

01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:47.700
Before Twist, before Twist got it.

01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:49.700
Twist just snatched it from us for a little while.

01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:51.700
When tornadoes were famous, you're like Archie Bunker.

01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:54.700
Had cheese eatin' at his colored people to get all the headlines.

01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:58.700
Remember when tornadoes were famous?

01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:02.700
All you had to do was know a few steps to rip up a trailer.

01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:04.700
That was talent.

01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:10.700
Now this Sammy Davis, this Nat King Cole.

01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:12.700
Did you ever see like an actual tornado, like a twister?

01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:13.700
No, never.

01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:14.700
No, no, no.

01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:18.700
Were you sad when that mean old lady took her little dog from you?

01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:21.700
No, because my sisters wanted the dog.

01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:22.700
I was a little bit more.

01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:25.700
Also, I believe you got to ride the horse in the direction it was facing.

01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:32.700
I have a very faint childhood memory because my great grandpa was from Oklahoma.

01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:33.700
Right near you.

01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:34.700
Sure, yes.

01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:35.700
I mean.

01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:36.700
In tornado world.

01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:37.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:42.700
And I was like, I have a very, very like remote childhood memory of like,

01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:46.700
you know how when you're a kid you pretend to be asleep to get the free ride to the car?

01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:49.700
Like you just figured that out.

01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.700
I wonder if parents know that.

01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:55.700
Like 85% of the time a sleeping child is just faking it.

01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:57.700
Do we ever call them on it?

01:48:57.700 --> 01:49:00.700
But I guess that's like sleep shaming and you don't want to do that either.

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:02.700
Because part of it you would listen and you would be like,

01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:06.700
I remember I would do that at Grandma's house and they go,

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:07.700
is he really sleeping?

01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:08.700
Is he faking it?

01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:11.700
And I'd be like, fuck you, bitch.

01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:13.700
You'd think that or say that?

01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:15.700
I would think they would say it.

01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:18.700
I'm not a Roger Rabbit character.

01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:20.700
I didn't have that word power yet.

01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:21.700
Yeah.

01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:23.700
I was like, I would have been a Goo Goo Gaga.

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:27.700
But I was like, I was like, don't you dare like Aunt Susie.

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:30.700
Don't you dare like sleep shame me.

01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:31.700
I could be asleep.

01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:33.700
That's what's important.

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:35.700
All you're doing half the time I'm awake.

01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:37.700
You're hoping I fall asleep.

01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:41.700
I was like, yeah, you're always complaining about my energy level.

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.700
I lay down in a sleeping bag and you tell me that I look cute.

01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:45.700
What do you think I'm going to keep doing?

01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:47.700
Anything that provides comfort is a potential addiction.

01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:49.700
Yeah.

01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:50.700
Just roll with it.

01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:51.700
Get me in the car.

01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.700
Get me home and shut the fuck up.

01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:59.700
I'm the sack of potatoes you always hoped I'd be.

01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:02.700
So much anger, the angry little child.

01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:04.700
They poured it into me like a sponge.

01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:06.700
They're anger, not mine.

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:07.700
Yours.

01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:12.700
All of yours.

01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:15.700
So I have this memory of being carried.

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:22.700
I was pretensly sleeping and my dad carried me through what seemed like a tornado.

01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:29.700
We went to the tornado seller every place in the lower Midwest has a tornado seller.

01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:32.700
It's not like a special thing like bomb shelters.

01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:35.700
It's like everybody has a tornado seller.

01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:37.700
We just had a basement.

01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:40.700
The basement was underground, like legit.

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:44.700
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to brag, but yeah, it was fully underground.

01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:49.700
We used to hide under the pool table.

01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:51.700
Yeah, you got to make that's a good way.

01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:54.700
What do you guys think about that earthquake thing when they go like hide under a thing?

01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:57.700
Isn't that just to create a pocket of air so you die slowly?

01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:00.700
You're supposed to find a triangle, right?

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:06.700
You're supposed to find something that won't immediately break by the initial impact of everything above you,

01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:10.700
but that just means that you'll take days to die.

01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:12.700
Yeah, I mean...

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:17.700
Because either something's falling, either you're aware things are falling that much on top of you,

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:21.700
in which case you're either dead right away or dead in three days.

01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:23.700
This is my opinion, I hope I'm wrong.

01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:29.700
But when they say like find a doorway, there's been that cynical joke of that's where they look to find you.

01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:32.700
But I think that there's a truth to that where they're saying like,

01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:38.700
well, there's air pockets, structural air pockets, and that's where people have been for like three days.

01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:41.700
I'm somewhat claustrophobic.

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:46.700
Yeah, but that might be a first world problem that the second you're sort of underneath a bunch of rubble,

01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:50.700
you'll be like, oh, this is a lot worse than not.

01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:52.700
They're like not existing.

01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:55.700
In the third world, they're like, actually, at least my boss isn't whipping me.

01:51:55.700 --> 01:52:00.700
In the third world, it's like the earth's shaking, this could all turn out better than it was.

01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:03.700
They're like snow day.

01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:04.700
I would only assume.

01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:10.700
When we were kids, when it was snow and we couldn't go to school, we'd run out and dig holes in the snow and stay in it.

01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:16.700
It's so funny, the rest of the world is so poor.

01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:20.700
When I was a kid here, I don't know if it happened anymore,

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:23.700
but when I was a kid, there were smog days where the air quality was so bad,

01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:27.700
you couldn't go outside and have recess because you would get like a burning, painful chest.

01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:29.700
It was really, really bad.

01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:31.700
You couldn't go to basketball practice or anything.

01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:35.700
You had to stay inside and not ever go outside because the smog was so bad.

01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:39.700
Then they took the lead out of the gasoline and I think that stopped.

01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:41.700
That's a lie.

01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:42.700
That's a huge lie.

01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:44.700
That's very, very a huge lie.

01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:46.700
You know Sammy Snopes?

01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:48.700
I'm Sammy Snopes.

01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:49.700
That's a huge lie.

01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:52.700
I love Hitler and I'm orange.

01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:54.700
I'm Sammy Snopes.

01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:56.700
You didn't Trump or what?

01:52:56.700 --> 01:52:59.700
I was trying to do Trump, but I don't have a Trump.

01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:01.700
You've got to start with your fire.

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.700
That's like your fire.

01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:04.700
You're fired.

01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:06.700
You're fired?

01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:08.700
You've got to say like, you're fired.

01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:09.700
You're fired.

01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:10.700
You're fired.

01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:11.700
You're fired.

01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:12.700
I'm Vinnie Bobby.

01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:14.700
Sammy Snopes because I started with your fire.

01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:16.700
You're fired.

01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:21.700
Automatically everyone is agreeing that this is a fantastic Trump impersonation.

01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:22.700
You're fired.

01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:23.700
You're fired.

01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:28.700
I just shot with Dana Carvey and he has an amazing Trump force.

01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:32.700
He has these, his impressions are always like that amazing.

01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:33.700
What does it sound like?

01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:39.700
Well, I can't, but as with his impressions, if you hear them, then everyone will be doing Trump perfectly.

01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:43.700
Will and Jason, do you know that Dan does a really good Iced Tea impression?

01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:45.700
No, does he?

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:46.700
Yeah.

01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:52.700
It's pretty good.

01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:54.700
Do you want to beat or do you want to just do it yourself?

01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:56.700
No, just give me a topic.

01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:57.700
I'll talk about...

01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:58.700
Rain shoes.

01:53:58.700 --> 01:53:59.700
Rain shoes.

01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:01.700
Rain shoes?

01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:03.700
Like rain boots?

01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:05.700
Rain shoes.

01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:06.700
Yeah.

01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:07.700
Rain shoes.

01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:09.700
Listen, man.

01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:14.700
Everything you've been wearing on your feet, shit.

01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:20.700
That ain't shit.

01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:24.700
New rain shoes, it ain't personal.

01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:26.700
It's business.

01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:29.700
I kind of lost my momentum.

01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:30.700
No, that was it.

01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:34.700
It's not polite to make people...

01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:36.700
The back loved it.

01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:40.700
They're like, oh, shit, another guest.

01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:44.700
Yeah, they don't know that.

01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:47.700
Iced tea's here.

01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:49.700
Shut the fuck up, Iced tea's here.

01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:51.700
Listen.

01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:58.700
Dan and Rob, what a lot of people don't know is that Jason Sudeikis does one of the greatest rosy pares impressions as you've ever heard.

01:54:58.700 --> 01:54:59.700
Billy!

01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:01.700
Oh, Billy.

01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:03.700
What is a quince?

01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:05.700
She lives right near us in Brooklyn.

01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:06.700
What?

01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:07.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:08.700
Rosie Perez lives right near us.

01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:10.700
I just watched the white man can jump recently.

01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:11.700
Delightful movie.

01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:12.700
It's a good movie.

01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:13.700
An independent movie.

01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:14.700
This is really like his comparison.

01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:15.700
No, not at all.

01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:16.700
It's a big old studio movie.

01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:17.700
I love it.

01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:18.700
But when you watch it, you're just like, oh my god, this is...

01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:22.700
The outfit that Wesley Snipes wears while playing basketball is one of the most hilarious things.

01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:24.700
No one's ever played sports wearing a painter's hat.

01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:27.700
He's like a gay Italian bicyclist.

01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:30.700
Well, no, that's what Wesley Snipes dressed like that.

01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:37.700
Wesley Snipes outfit is just as ridiculous because he's got the bicycle hat flipped up and a very deep cut tank top.

01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:39.700
Were you saying Wesley or Woody?

01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:40.700
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.700
Woody Harrelson's outfit's pretty nuts too.

01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:42.700
It's awesome.

01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:43.700
The 80s is really good.

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:44.700
90s, 80s.

01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:45.700
90s, I think.

01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:46.700
Or 89, maybe 91.

01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:47.700
90, 91?

01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:48.700
Yeah.

01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:51.700
Anyway, we saw her at a restaurant right when we first moved to the hood and she goes,

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:52.700
oh, you guys live here?

01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:53.700
Oh, no.

01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:54.700
What?

01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:57.700
Here comes the neighborhood.

01:55:57.700 --> 01:56:00.700
Yeah, exactly.

01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:03.700
Oh, live here well, live here fine.

01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:04.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:05.700
Oh, great.

01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:07.700
I kind of took it...

01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:08.700
I wear it with a badge of honor.

01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:09.700
I like that.

01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:10.700
I'd say, yeah, I guess so, yeah.

01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:11.700
That's so amazing.

01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:12.700
She wasn't like...

01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:13.700
Maybe she wasn't...

01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:14.700
Not kidding.

01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:18.700
Golly.

01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:20.700
This dummy thought she was a joke.

01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:21.700
Maybe it wasn't as I'm saying it now.

01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:26.700
Is it okay to talk about what your wife is doing while she's here?

01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:27.700
Yeah, I think so.

01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:29.700
She's just fucking a bunch of dudes, right?

01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:30.700
Yeah.

01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:31.700
That's fine.

01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:32.700
You're fine with that, right?

01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:33.700
Is this called cuckold fetish?

01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:34.700
What's it called?

01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:35.700
Well, it's not a fetish.

01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:36.700
I mean, I have no...

01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:37.700
You don't like it.

01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:38.700
It doesn't turn me on.

01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:39.700
No.

01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:40.700
But I don't hate it.

01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:41.700
You know what I mean?

01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:42.700
It's like...

01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:45.700
She's the breadwinner and it's going to be how it's going to be.

01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:46.700
Yeah, but she's not.

01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:47.700
It's like...

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:51.700
She acquires nothing except for potentially diseases.

01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:52.700
Right.

01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:54.700
Who knows what memories that I'll...

01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:55.700
You try to be encouraging.

01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:56.700
You're just saying...

01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:59.700
Yeah, I'm like, all right, have fun.

01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:00.700
What do you say?

01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:01.700
You're just kind of like, I get it.

01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:04.700
And at the same time, you're like, I wish this wasn't the way.

01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:07.700
But then I'm also like, you know what?

01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:11.700
We only get one shot on this marble, you know?

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:13.700
For better or for worse.

01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:15.700
For better or for worse.

01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:16.700
I ride that horse.

01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:17.700
The cuckold's mantra.

01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:18.700
Yeah.

01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:21.700
We only get one shot on this marble.

01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:25.700
No, no, that's not word play.

01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:26.700
You guys are...

01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:27.700
Oh, that's a terrible...

01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:28.700
No, no, no.

01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:29.700
I just touched my...

01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:30.700
I touched it by accident.

01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:31.700
There was a mystery.

01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:34.700
Yeah, that's how it started.

01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:35.700
Oh!

01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:37.700
I was like...

01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:40.700
And I was, of course, I was like, yeah, well, okay.

01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:41.700
As long as it...

01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:45.700
That's why I have this podium is I've been touching it by accident during the entire show.

01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:48.700
Is she doing a music video or something?

01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:50.700
Yeah, she's directing a music video for the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:51.700
Okay.

01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:52.700
Yeah.

01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:56.700
She's had phone calls with Flea and she's just like, oh my God, if like the 15 year old

01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:59.700
me, like, you know, it's one of those nuts moments for her.

01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:00.700
It's her second one.

01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:02.700
She directed an Edward Sharp video and then this is her second one.

01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:03.700
Yeah, that doesn't...

01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:08.700
She doesn't need anything plugged, but I think it's worth promoting Olivia Wilde's director

01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:09.700
and producer.

01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:10.700
100%.

01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:11.700
No, it's one of the...

01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:15.700
I mean, it's one of the most amazing things about, you know, being with her is like being

01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:16.700
able to brag about her.

01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:17.700
But this one is such a cool one.

01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:21.700
I told, I tell everybody, it's more fun to brag about your partner than it is yourself,

01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:22.700
at least for me.

01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:23.700
It's like...

01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:27.700
But he gets in some brags of his own...

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.700
He showed us the Nike closet.

01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:30.700
Yeah, I watched it.

01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:31.700
He didn't walk past it.

01:58:31.700 --> 01:58:32.700
No, no.

01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:34.700
He was like, by the way, here's every shoe name by Nike.

01:58:34.700 --> 01:58:36.700
But I didn't know as I was going to do it.

01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:40.700
I was like, well, these guys aren't a safe space, but here we go.

01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:42.700
I'll hear about this.

01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:44.700
This will be podcast.

01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:45.700
It's like, this is me.

01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:46.700
Oh, well.

01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:47.700
This is the record.

01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:48.700
It's the size of an elevator.

01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:49.700
Your house is crazy.

01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:51.700
He has an arcade down in the basement.

01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:56.700
It's the size of an elevator, and it's on the fourth story of the first four-story

01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:58.700
house I've ever been in in my life.

01:58:58.700 --> 01:58:59.700
Second floor.

01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:02.700
All right, but there were two above us when I...

01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:03.700
Yeah.

01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:05.700
I've never been on that many...

01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:10.700
I've never been on that many floors of a building when I wasn't being yelled at by somebody,

01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:12.700
or being turned down for a job.

01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:13.700
Same, same.

01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:17.700
I was in a person's home, and I was on a fourth floor at one point.

01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:18.700
It's not lost in me.

01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:19.700
I didn't pay for the whole thing.

01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:20.700
It's a 50-50 endeavor.

01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:24.700
We're hoping our little guy does something interesting and pays us back.

01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:28.700
When you were doing the Gary Marshall movie, you're saying, like, I'm only doing this to

01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:29.700
pay for the rugs.

01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:33.700
I'm like, how many rugs?

01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:35.700
There's a lot of...

01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:38.700
Yeah, there's a lot of rugs when you have a house.

01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:40.700
And four-storys, it's a lot of bare floor.

01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:41.700
And I didn't know rugs.

01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:42.700
I didn't know...

01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:43.700
But you get a kid.

01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:46.700
Four-storys plus bare floor equals a two-year-old...

01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:48.700
That's like a disaster.

01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:50.700
Sliding and stairs.

01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:51.700
Yeah, absolutely.

01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:52.700
You need rugs for that kid.

01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:53.700
You gotta have rugs.

01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:54.700
You need friction.

01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:55.700
And rugs are super pricey.

01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:56.700
Rugs are super pricey.

01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:57.700
I didn't know that.

01:59:57.700 --> 01:59:58.700
What kind of rugs you get?

01:59:58.700 --> 01:59:59.700
You get some nice Persian rugs?

01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:00.700
What do you got?

02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:01.700
I don't think there's any Persian in there.

02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:04.700
It's like ABC, you know, like carpet.

02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:05.700
Is it what?

02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:07.700
There's a carpet place called ABC carpet.

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:08.700
I thought it was like...

02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:11.700
They were kids' rugs, like they had ABCs on them.

02:00:11.700 --> 02:00:12.700
No.

02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:13.700
No, we're just...

02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:14.700
No.

02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:15.700
No, we don't...

02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:16.700
We had...

02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:20.700
Someone sent us a nice little, like, throw rug that was all the states, but we...

02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:22.700
I think we donated it to a local grade school.

02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:24.700
Did you hear that, Maya Rudolph?

02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:25.700
Yeah.

02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:26.700
Could have given it to you.

02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:28.700
Your fucking rug sucked.

02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:30.700
It's the thought that counts.

02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:31.700
Oh, God.

02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:33.700
I don't think she sent it to us.

02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:34.700
She bought it.

02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:37.700
Forte, do you have kids' family?

02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:38.700
I don't.

02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:40.700
I have nothing, none of that.

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:43.700
So just by choice or just because you're...

02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:45.700
I'm very late on this thing.

02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:48.700
I want to do it at some point.

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:53.700
You mean like you want to have sex at some point?

02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:56.700
Jeff, I have sex.

02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:57.700
Woo!

02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:58.700
That was like...

02:00:58.700 --> 02:00:59.700
Prove it.

02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:00.700
Oh!

02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:04.700
Korean style.

02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:06.700
All right.

02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:07.700
Well...

02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:10.700
The show is over.

02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:11.700
No, the shit has hit the fan.

02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:12.700
The show is over.

02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:13.700
Yeah, I heard the music cue.

02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:17.700
You're just about to talk about my lack of family and stuff like that.

02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:20.700
I was going to get to friggin' get therapeutic here.

02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:23.700
That's been a show of thanks for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:25.700
I'm looking.

02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:28.700
Let's hear it for Spencer Crittenden.

02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:29.700
Rob Schaub.

02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:30.700
Find me out there.

02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:31.700
I'll talk to you about it.

02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:35.700
Jason Zidekis.

02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:38.700
Will Forte.

02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:40.700
I'm Jeff, your mayor's dad.

02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:43.700
Thank you for coming, everybody.

02:01:43.700 --> 02:02:07.700
Drive fast and take chances.
