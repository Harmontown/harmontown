02:28.280\nsong.\n\n02:28.280 --> 02:29.280\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n02:29.280 --> 02:33.280\nIt's good to be back here in California.\n\n02:33.280 --> 02:47.160\nIt would have been nice to get some asses in these seats, but it's good that some of\n\n02:47.160 --> 02:48.160\nyou could have turned out.\n\n02:48.160 --> 02:56.560\nWe have about 500 Angelinos in the audience, they all paid top dollar, ten dollars at least.\n\n02:56.560 --> 03:00.160\nSome people, Jeff, paid more than that, some people paid for some VIP treatment.\n\n03:00.160 --> 03:03.920\nYeah, there was some kickstarter nonsense going on, but I've never quite understood\n\n03:03.920 --> 03:07.080\nhow you do a kickstarter to make people come to a show.\n\n03:07.080 --> 03:15.360\nNot nonsense, Jeff, Harmon sense.\n\n03:15.360 --> 03:18.800\nI mean, there's 500 people here at least, but Dan has already gone to make a cocktail,\n\n03:18.800 --> 03:19.800\nwhich is fantastic.\n\n03:19.800 --> 03:23.240\nWell, because I had to leave mine back there because I'm strapped with all of this equipment,\n\n03:23.240 --> 03:27.440\nthe director of the documentary has put me to work, there's a GoPro camera on my head\n\n03:27.440 --> 03:33.640\nshooting everybody, that'll get some beautiful images of not you waving just that light\n\n03:33.640 --> 03:34.640\nright there.\n\n03:34.640 --> 03:43.040\nThere's a camera on your chest looking up at the camera on your head, but normally you\n\n03:43.040 --> 03:51.080\nspend so much time, Dan, I mean, I couldn't do this at home in the bathroom or anything.\n\n03:51.080 --> 03:54.240\nYou spend so much time looking at your feet anyway, there's gonna be a camera shooting\n\n03:54.240 --> 03:59.520\ncamera, it's gonna be like a Bruce Lee Hall of Mirrors going on.\n\n03:59.520 --> 04:00.520\nIt's meta, dude.\n\n04:00.520 --> 04:02.040\nDon't want to make you a drink while you address the crowd.\n\n04:02.040 --> 04:07.640\nYeah, could you please just, Christ, man, I'm a fucking showman, I've got shit to do.\n\n04:07.640 --> 04:13.080\nWe got so much VIP treatment to knock out, but it's good to see so many old friends,\n\n04:13.080 --> 04:14.080\ntoo.\n\n04:14.080 --> 04:18.080\nI mean, we got to do this, we got to do a bullet train version of Harmontown, man.\n\n04:18.080 --> 04:22.640\nWe got some special guests here tonight, we got a good friend that's fresh out of radiation,\n\n04:22.640 --> 04:30.080\nI want to talk to him about his balls, and we got an old hero that we made closer friends\n\n04:30.080 --> 04:36.560\nwith on the road out there, and we have the Barbara Walters of Comedy, who's gonna give\n\n04:36.560 --> 04:40.040\nme some tips on interviewing, and I think he's got a pretty interesting story.\n\n04:40.040 --> 04:44.760\nBut let's get these jingles out of the way.\n\n04:44.760 --> 04:52.240\nThese are gonna be, so on the, these are gonna be a cappella anyway, it doesn't matter.\n\n04:52.240 --> 04:54.120\nYeah, I don't know any of them.\n\n04:54.120 --> 04:59.840\nOn the Kickstarter that we were selling tickets through, we offered, for $250 you could get\n\n04:59.840 --> 05:02.680\na jingle written about your name.\n\n05:02.680 --> 05:10.160\nSo the first person to take us up on it was our friend David Butler, who's our accountant.\n\n05:10.160 --> 05:13.160\nWho as far as we know paid for these tickets with our money.\n\n05:13.160 --> 05:14.160\nRight.\n\n05:14.160 --> 05:19.960\nSo he bought the option, so, so here's David Butler's jingle.\n\n05:19.960 --> 05:26.080\nIt's a comedy show.\n\n05:26.080 --> 05:29.080\nNo, no, no, I'm sorry, laugh.\n\n05:29.080 --> 05:33.560\nNot my metronome, that.\n\n05:33.560 --> 05:40.040\nThe Butler did it, David Butler did it, the Butler did it in the butt, but when David Butler\n\n05:40.040 --> 05:45.720\ndid it, he regretted and he hit it, so he did it, but we don't know what, and when\n\n05:45.720 --> 05:52.760\nButler does it, he gets away because it never leaves a single clue, so when you meet a Butler,\n\n05:52.760 --> 05:56.960\nkeep your eyes on all your butts, or David Butler will be doing you.\n\n05:56.960 --> 06:06.200\nInvestigators on the scene can never find, this Butler's nuts and wiener deep in your\n\n06:06.200 --> 06:15.040\nbehind, and when there is no evidence, there is no crime.\n\n06:15.040 --> 06:22.000\nOh, the Butler does it, but he does no time.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:27.640\nThe Butler did it, David Butler did it, he did it, but we don't know what.\n\n06:27.640 --> 06:39.760\nHe didn't use a candlestick, his weapon is a giant dick, his victim is another butt.\n\n06:39.760 --> 06:40.760\nYou can have your money back.\n\n06:40.760 --> 06:47.160\nYou know what's going to be good, this shot on my shitty VHS camera, it looks like the\n\n06:47.160 --> 06:51.280\nLawrence Walk Show out there, it looks really nice.\n\n06:51.280 --> 06:57.040\nThese guys didn't really have their money back, Jim, Jim, what's his name, Spicoli?\n\n06:57.040 --> 07:00.760\nIs that you right there?\n\n07:00.760 --> 07:01.760\nHello.\n\n07:01.760 --> 07:08.200\nJim Scampoli, thank you for your $250, you can have it back, yes I know, you emailed\n\n07:08.200 --> 07:12.040\nand said, I know the thing is for a name, could you make it for the name of my comedy\n\n07:12.040 --> 07:18.520\nshow, Jim and Them, hilarious for me to stand up here and sing Your Jingle for Your Show.\n\n07:18.520 --> 07:26.480\nBut Turnabout's Fair Play, it's a shitty song, so I literally wrote it while like, you know.\n\n07:26.480 --> 07:31.200\nDan had, in backstage had one hand had a Chick-fil-A sandwich in it, and the other hand was trying\n\n07:31.200 --> 07:32.680\nto write this song.\n\n07:32.680 --> 07:37.240\nOkay, so there's going to be a background track, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and\n\n07:37.240 --> 07:44.200\nThem, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them are everywhere, and when\n\n07:44.200 --> 07:51.480\nthey die, no one will care, but they'll be buried side by side with hands clasped tight\n\n07:51.480 --> 07:59.080\nand heads held high, they're just some friends of a guy named Jim, they don't have much,\n\n07:59.080 --> 08:07.080\nbut they've got him, oh Christmas tree, oh Jim and Them, let's drink some pee, Jim and\n\n08:07.080 --> 08:10.320\nThem, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and\n\n08:10.320 --> 08:16.560\nThem paid for this song, it was supposed to be a name, so they did it wrong, but Jim\n\n08:16.560 --> 08:25.400\nand Them are where it's at, all dogs are boys, all girls are cats, that's all I got.\n\n08:25.400 --> 08:53.920\nYou can have your money back, it's free, Jim, Sports Corner!\n\n08:53.920 --> 09:00.400\nSo Dan, what a bull, no ordinary bull, Jeff, never is this time of year, how do you feel\n\n09:00.400 --> 09:06.120\nabout the city that hosted the Super Bowl, how did they do as a city, well it's great\n\n09:06.120 --> 09:10.200\nwhen the team can be on their home turf, they always gain more confidence from that, so\n\n09:10.200 --> 09:14.480\nyou thought the Saints had the home field advantage there, great to see them having\n\n09:14.480 --> 09:23.200\nthe home field advantage, now you heard about the big gaff of the electricity, yeah, these\n\n09:23.200 --> 09:27.040\nthings are going to happen, Jeff, there's a lot of electricity pouring into the stadiums\n\n09:27.040 --> 09:32.200\nwhen people play and so someone's going to always hit the wrong switch or something.\n\n09:32.200 --> 09:35.040\nSo who did you have your money on going into that game?\n\n09:35.040 --> 09:39.760\nI was a bird's, what was the Ravens?\n\n09:39.760 --> 09:42.120\nRavens, you got one right!\n\n09:42.120 --> 09:50.840\nWell I learned this in San Francisco, I was thinking Ravens maybe, then I thought maybe\n\n09:50.840 --> 09:56.280\n49ers and then, Jeff, it's all about yardage, so I just thought I would wait to see which\n\n09:56.280 --> 10:00.560\nteam got more yardage and then base it on that, did you know, Jeff, that they were playing\n\n10:00.560 --> 10:01.840\non artificial turf?\n\n10:01.840 --> 10:07.440\nI did know that, because it was an indoor dome, yeah, so the yardage is wider, you gain\n\n10:07.440 --> 10:16.880\nmore yardage, sunlight shortens yards, yeah, great bull, great game, amazing the outcome,\n\n10:16.880 --> 10:20.680\nwho could have predicted it, not me, certainly nobody, we don't need to repeat it, you don't\n\n10:20.680 --> 10:24.000\nneed to quiz me on it, that's not what sports corners are about.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:31.280\nNow it's time for an all tennis, Australian Open Talk!\n\n10:31.280 --> 10:32.280\nG'day!\n\n10:32.280 --> 10:37.200\nWow, some Australian Open, huh Harmon?\n\n10:37.200 --> 10:40.840\nWow, Wimbledon's got nothing on the Australians, Jeff.\n\n10:40.840 --> 10:41.840\nWhy is that?\n\n10:41.840 --> 10:48.320\nWell, they've got courts that are larger, they've got, the nets are higher, people are\n\n10:48.320 --> 10:54.200\nout there, they want to win, you know, they swing the rackets, actually the umpire comes\n\n10:54.200 --> 10:57.320\nout at the beginning and puts a larger net out, and if he holds the original sized net\n\n10:57.320 --> 11:02.320\nand goes, that's not a net, then they bring out the Australian net and he goes, now that's\n\n11:02.320 --> 11:03.320\na net.\n\n11:03.320 --> 11:09.520\nYeah, he lets you know, sports corner sucks, let's kill it, I knew too much about the Super\n\n11:09.520 --> 11:11.840\nBull because I actually went to the bar and I actually went to the bar and I actually\n\n11:11.840 --> 11:12.840\nwent to the bar.\n\n11:12.840 --> 11:14.600\nThat's why I went to Australian Open, you don't know shit about tennis.\n\n11:14.600 --> 11:17.760\nI know, but then I said the courts are longer, I don't know what sports, I don't know what\n\n11:17.760 --> 11:22.040\nthe joke is anymore, I don't get it, I don't get my own joke anymore.\n\n11:22.040 --> 11:24.640\nYou've got too many cameras on your head, I don't like sports, I don't know anything\n\n11:24.640 --> 11:28.560\nabout sports, I've got a bunch of cameras in my head, let's just, let's free-form.\n\n11:28.560 --> 11:32.520\nIf you could be good at any sport, honestly, if you could be good at one physical activity\n\n11:32.520 --> 11:35.520\nor sport, what would be the one thing you'd be awesome at?\n\n11:35.520 --> 11:37.480\nDoes it come at the expense of anything else?\n\n11:37.480 --> 11:39.160\nNo, no, you poof and you have it.\n\n11:39.160 --> 11:41.240\nOkay, just an extra thing I get to do.\n\n11:41.240 --> 11:44.680\nYou can hit a baseball farther than anybody or you're the world's best golfer or you\n\n11:44.680 --> 11:51.560\ncan scoop a dive deeper or I don't know, I almost want to say Billiards, but then it\n\n11:51.560 --> 11:57.720\nwould just be one of those billiard dicks, because that's where it would come in handy.\n\n11:57.720 --> 12:06.680\nSome people call me Billiards dick, because I got a pocket for a ball, some people call\n\n12:06.680 --> 12:14.640\nme Billiards dick because I live inside a billiards hall, yeah, oh I got chops.\n\n12:14.640 --> 12:22.280\nI live inside a place where they play pool and I fuck your mama all the time.\n\n12:22.280 --> 12:23.280\nRhyme.\n\n12:23.280 --> 12:24.280\nOkay.\n\n12:24.280 --> 12:25.280\nSqueeze a lime?\n\n12:25.280 --> 12:26.280\nWhat are you going to say there yet?\n\n12:26.280 --> 12:27.280\nNo, no, no, I don't care.\n\n12:27.280 --> 12:29.880\nYou've been rapping across this great nation of ours and you still haven't learned to stop\n\n12:29.880 --> 12:32.360\nsaying south and mouth.\n\n12:32.360 --> 12:33.360\nTime and rhyme.\n\n12:33.360 --> 12:34.360\nTime and rhyme.\n\n12:34.360 --> 12:35.360\nMama and llama.\n\n12:35.360 --> 12:36.360\nYou know, I don't know.\n\n12:36.360 --> 12:42.200\nI don't know if any of you had listened to the podcast as we went across the country.\n\n12:42.200 --> 12:47.040\nI felt there was an opportunity there for Dan to really grow as a rapper and I think\n\n12:47.040 --> 12:49.480\nnow is the time to test whether or not you have.\n\n12:49.480 --> 12:51.480\nI got good at rapping.\n\n12:51.480 --> 12:52.480\nYou can hear me running around Madison.\n\n12:52.480 --> 12:53.480\nYou can hear me starting to get really good.\n\n12:53.480 --> 12:54.480\nYo, yo, yo, freestyle, freestyle.\n\n12:54.480 --> 12:55.480\nOn the top of my head, don't know what to say.\n\n12:55.480 --> 12:56.480\nPunch a comment in the grass at the hay.\n\n12:56.480 --> 12:57.480\nTook a picture board instead of my dick.\n\n12:57.480 --> 12:58.480\nStuck it inside her like a lunatic.\n\n12:58.480 --> 12:59.480\nShe died.\n\n12:59.480 --> 13:00.480\nI went to prison.\n\n13:00.480 --> 13:12.480\nNewton, in the middle of the prison, split light to three colors.\n\n13:12.480 --> 13:21.480\nI punched a comment and then her brother, that's my uncle, no, it's yours.\n\n13:21.480 --> 13:22.480\nI punched her.\n\n13:22.480 --> 13:23.480\nThey're all pores.\n\n13:23.480 --> 13:24.480\nI punched her butt, I punched her right.\n\n13:24.480 --> 13:25.480\nI punched them with toothpaste, made their teeth bright.\n\n13:25.480 --> 13:26.480\nI punched them.\n\n13:26.480 --> 13:27.480\nI punched them on their tongues.\n\n13:27.480 --> 13:32.480\nI punched them in their mouth and then I was done.\n\n13:32.480 --> 13:33.480\nI was done.\n\n13:33.480 --> 13:34.480\nI was done.\n\n13:34.480 --> 13:35.480\nI was done.\n\n13:35.480 --> 13:36.480\nOkay, I was wrong.\n\n13:36.480 --> 13:37.480\nThanks, Los Angeles.\n\n13:37.480 --> 13:38.480\nWest Coast.\n\n13:38.480 --> 13:53.480\nYou fucked up a woman's brother and for a moment consider that was your own uncle.\n\n13:53.480 --> 13:56.480\nYeah, well, but you fight as many mamas as I do.\n\n13:56.480 --> 13:59.480\nChances are you're fucking one of your own uncles.\n\n13:59.480 --> 14:02.480\nGenealogy becomes a haze.\n\n14:02.480 --> 14:06.480\nEveryone's mama becomes like a silver Prius, you know.\n\n14:06.480 --> 14:08.480\nIt's like the most common thing.\n\n14:08.480 --> 14:10.480\nYou're just lost in the parking lot.\n\n14:10.480 --> 14:12.480\nAll right, Herman, I missed you in the drive home.\n\n14:12.480 --> 14:13.480\nHoly shit.\n\n14:13.480 --> 14:14.480\nYou all right?\n\n14:14.480 --> 14:16.480\nYeah, well, there's blood coming back to me.\n\n14:16.480 --> 14:17.480\nJesus Christ.\n\n14:17.480 --> 14:21.480\nIn Denver, you blame the altitude, but we're not high right now.\n\n14:21.480 --> 14:25.480\nYeah, I'm a little high.\n\n14:25.480 --> 14:32.480\nAll right, Jeff, but I left you for a while then and I had to fly off to Vegas to do a\n\n14:32.480 --> 14:34.480\nthing and I missed the ride home.\n\n14:34.480 --> 14:35.480\nThe triumphant return.\n\n14:35.480 --> 14:36.480\nYeah.\n\n14:36.480 --> 14:37.480\nWhat did I miss?\n\n14:37.480 --> 14:38.480\nI don't know what you missed.\n\n14:38.480 --> 14:39.480\nYou missed the sad goodbyes.\n\n14:39.480 --> 14:41.480\nYou know, you missed.\n\n14:41.480 --> 14:43.480\nDid you see Splencers?\n\n14:43.480 --> 14:44.480\nSplencers.\n\n14:44.480 --> 14:46.480\nI saw when he added an L to his name.\n\n14:46.480 --> 14:47.480\nYeah.\n\n14:47.480 --> 14:55.480\nYeah, Spencer left his incredibly beautiful melancholy YouTubey kind of clip.\n\n14:55.480 --> 14:57.480\nWait, was he driving during that?\n\n14:57.480 --> 14:59.480\nHe kept talking about who's driving, but he was looking at the camera.\n\n14:59.480 --> 15:00.480\nI was worried about...\n\n15:00.480 --> 15:01.480\nHe had to drive out and see me valley.\n\n15:01.480 --> 15:03.480\nHe just gets in his car and just drives.\n\n15:03.480 --> 15:06.480\nAnd it was really, it was beautiful and it's sadness.\n\n15:06.480 --> 15:08.480\nHe's going to steal the documentary.\n\n15:08.480 --> 15:09.480\nWe know that.\n\n15:09.480 --> 15:10.480\nYeah.\n\n15:10.480 --> 15:13.480\nIt's going to be a documentary character that everyone's gay for.\n\n15:13.480 --> 15:17.480\nI like that guy.\n\n15:17.480 --> 15:19.480\nHe's going to be on the cover of the DVD.\n\n15:19.480 --> 15:20.480\nHe's beard.\n\n15:20.480 --> 15:22.480\nHe's bigger than you on our poster, I think, isn't he?\n\n15:22.480 --> 15:23.480\nLike on the...\n\n15:23.480 --> 15:24.480\nProbably.\n\n15:24.480 --> 15:26.480\nHis beard's bigger.\n\n15:26.480 --> 15:28.480\nBecause I didn't learn anything, Jeff.\n\n15:28.480 --> 15:29.480\nI didn't change out there.\n\n15:29.480 --> 15:31.480\nYou learned nothing from that?\n\n15:31.480 --> 15:33.480\nI got a little better at rapping.\n\n15:33.480 --> 15:35.480\nI learned a little bit.\n\n15:35.480 --> 15:41.480\nI learned that I'm an abusive boyfriend, but I think I already knew that.\n\n15:41.480 --> 15:44.480\nI learned that the fans are great.\n\n15:44.480 --> 15:45.480\nI learned they're good people.\n\n15:45.480 --> 15:50.480\nI learned that I can do whatever I want and that I don't know what to do with that permission.\n\n15:50.480 --> 15:55.480\nIt's a bore people, make them sad, sometimes gross them out.\n\n15:55.480 --> 15:57.480\nI learned that I smell like an onion.\n\n15:57.480 --> 16:04.480\nI learned that my hemorrhoid comes back quicker if I'm off my diet.\n\n16:04.480 --> 16:09.480\nYour hemorrhoid came back in Salt Lake City, I believe.\n\n16:09.480 --> 16:12.480\nDan was walking around backstage.\n\n16:39.480 --> 16:50.480\nI tried to keep it a secret, but it kept peeking out and I couldn't help but tell everyone.\n\n16:50.480 --> 16:58.480\nBecause when you got a hemorrhoid, it itches and it bleeds.\n\n16:58.480 --> 17:04.480\nAnd it doesn't matter what the audience needs.\n\n17:04.480 --> 17:10.480\nI just want to be truthful and tell her I got a fucking thing on my ass.\n\n17:10.480 --> 17:14.480\nHer word has been head of the class.\n\n17:14.480 --> 17:21.480\nSay it again, I'm saying her word has been head of the class.\n\n17:21.480 --> 17:26.480\nI got a hemorrhoid sticking out of my ass.\n\n17:26.480 --> 17:34.480\nToby Keith gonna make some pita skins and grenades. I'm gonna do countries and invade.\n\n17:34.480 --> 17:37.480\nI'm gonna wave the flag and suck a million balls.\n\n17:37.480 --> 17:42.480\nToby Keith gonna ride a tank and get you surprised.\n\n17:42.480 --> 17:50.480\nOh it's me, Toby Keith, surprised. I sang a song for you and I'm jerking off in the mirror every night.\n\n17:50.480 --> 18:01.480\nI fuck my mother and I cry when I masturbate. Toby Keith, I'm a big dumb fucking asshole, Toby Keith.\n\n18:01.480 --> 18:07.480\nEasy target. Easy target.\n\n18:07.480 --> 18:10.480\nYeah, we came down pretty hard on Toby Keith.\n\n18:10.480 --> 18:16.480\nHe barely survived the Dixie Chick. He's an easy target.\n\n18:16.480 --> 18:22.480\nI almost lost a fight to a Dixie Chick. Okay, let's start bringing some of our people up here.\n\n18:22.480 --> 18:24.480\nWe got people.\n\n18:24.480 --> 18:28.480\nWe got a roster of A-list people to talk to. I'm trying to think of what order to do them.\n\n18:28.480 --> 18:34.480\nI think that the most logical order will be to check in with...\n\n18:34.480 --> 18:37.480\nI'm sorry, I'm out of breath.\n\n18:37.480 --> 18:39.480\nYou're off your diet, man.\n\n18:39.480 --> 18:45.480\nI went off my diet and I'm out of breath by fake line dancing.\n\n18:45.480 --> 18:47.480\nHow much weight do you think you gained on the road?\n\n18:47.480 --> 18:49.480\nProbably like 15, 20 pounds.\n\n18:49.480 --> 18:53.480\nThere was a point where we went to In-N-Out and you weren't there.\n\n18:53.480 --> 18:57.480\nFrom San Francisco to LA, I was like, okay, I got to go back to the diet when I got to LA.\n\n18:57.480 --> 19:00.480\nThat's when the shit really hit the fan.\n\n19:00.480 --> 19:03.480\nThat's when the shame eating started.\n\n19:03.480 --> 19:07.480\nNot hungry at all, ever. Hungry, just eating, just to eat.\n\n19:07.480 --> 19:10.480\nJust because we went to LA, I was going to go back to the diet.\n\n19:10.480 --> 19:15.480\nI went to In-N-Out, got a double double with some fries, a Neapolitan shake.\n\n19:15.480 --> 19:18.480\nIt's a secret thing Spencer taught me about.\n\n19:18.480 --> 19:22.480\nThere's all kinds of stuff off the menu. You can get like a flying handjob.\n\n19:22.480 --> 19:28.480\nYou can get a reverse chihuahua.\n\n19:28.480 --> 19:35.480\nYou can get David Blaine's scrotum.\n\n19:35.480 --> 19:40.480\nK-Pickles and no onions, but three patties, but they're not on a bun.\n\n19:40.480 --> 19:43.480\nThey're on three sheets of paper and there's a cigarette on top.\n\n19:43.480 --> 19:47.480\nAnd they're suspended 40 miles above the earth.\n\n19:47.480 --> 19:55.480\nYeah, and then a bus drives by and it's got your dead friend's name on it.\n\n19:55.480 --> 19:58.480\nIt's only $4.95. It's really a deal.\n\n19:58.480 --> 20:01.480\nIt's pretty great, but it never goes away.\n\n20:01.480 --> 20:08.480\nAnd it's slowly just sadder and sadder.\n\n20:08.480 --> 20:11.480\nSo I got the double double.\n\n20:11.480 --> 20:15.480\nThe fries were stale. They were too crispy.\n\n20:15.480 --> 20:17.480\nOkay, you follow me?\n\n20:17.480 --> 20:19.480\nI got you.\n\n20:19.480 --> 20:24.480\nI went to an adjacent McDonald's and here's where it gets shady.\n\n20:24.480 --> 20:32.480\nThe bus had overheated and everyone was watching our bus driver Jason fix the engine on the bus.\n\n20:32.480 --> 20:34.480\nI went to a McDonald's.\n\n20:34.480 --> 20:38.480\nI was like, these fries are stale. I'm going to get some better fries at McDonald's.\n\n20:38.480 --> 20:41.480\nI went to the McDonald's.\n\n20:41.480 --> 20:49.480\nAnd they found one of your earlier French fries stuck in there just to buy you time to sabotage the engine to go to McDonald's.\n\n20:49.480 --> 20:55.480\nBut I'm not going to only get fries. I got a quarter pounder with cheese.\n\n20:55.480 --> 21:01.480\nAnd I got another milkshake.\n\n21:01.480 --> 21:05.480\nAnd I put it all in the bag.\n\n21:05.480 --> 21:10.480\nI put the milkshake in a bag so I would just look like I had fries.\n\n21:10.480 --> 21:15.480\nAnd I just walked past everybody who was on a picnic watching the bus get fixed.\n\n21:15.480 --> 21:22.480\nTop of the morning. I want to finish off these fries and go take a nap.\n\n21:22.480 --> 21:26.480\nAnd I just went into a bus and hid while I ate.\n\n21:26.480 --> 21:32.480\n16-year-old with real problems.\n\n21:32.480 --> 21:36.480\nBut I'm 40 and the real problem is that shit will kill you, man. What am I doing?\n\n21:36.480 --> 21:39.480\nAlright, let's talk about speaking of...\n\n21:39.480 --> 21:41.480\nOur next guest.\n\n21:41.480 --> 21:44.480\nOur next guest is no stranger to...\n\n21:44.480 --> 21:51.480\nDiabetes.\n\n21:51.480 --> 21:54.480\nOur next guest we kept running into on the road out there.\n\n21:54.480 --> 21:57.480\nAnd he's an old hero of mine in terms of performance.\n\n21:57.480 --> 22:05.480\nI don't want that on him because I don't have an act and I'm not doing anything that he would want attributed to him.\n\n22:05.480 --> 22:10.480\nBut when we were in Milwaukee we saw him do something incredibly inspiring.\n\n22:10.480 --> 22:16.480\nMe and Schrab and he put us past the tipping point of moving to LA.\n\n22:16.480 --> 22:28.480\nHe was a master stand-up at one point and then at another point completely reinvented as a guy that would make some great indie films.\n\n22:28.480 --> 22:34.480\nSo please welcome our friend, our road dog, our strange soulmate, Bob Goldthwaite.\n\n22:34.480 --> 22:41.480\nI think...\n\n22:41.480 --> 22:43.480\nI'll just let you have this.\n\n22:43.480 --> 22:45.480\nYeah, okay, there you go.\n\n22:45.480 --> 22:47.480\nHello. Check what?\n\n22:47.480 --> 22:48.480\nHey, hi, thank you.\n\n22:48.480 --> 22:50.480\nHey, how are you?\n\n22:50.480 --> 22:51.480\nI'm good, I'm good.\n\n22:51.480 --> 22:55.480\nI'd love to take credit for your comedy stylings.\n\n22:55.480 --> 23:02.480\nWell, you have a reputation like there's stories about you doing some insane shit on stage.\n\n23:02.480 --> 23:10.480\nWhat was the story about, please forgive me for not getting the details right, I'm going to sound like your dad or something.\n\n23:10.480 --> 23:13.480\nHe lit Crispin Glover on fire one time.\n\n23:13.480 --> 23:15.480\nCorrect, yes.\n\n23:15.480 --> 23:20.480\nThere was another thing, were you opening for Pearl Jam or what?\n\n23:20.480 --> 23:22.480\nNo, I opened up for Nirvana.\n\n23:22.480 --> 23:24.480\nNirvana, okay, close enough.\n\n23:24.480 --> 23:28.480\nFirst of all, hello everybody.\n\n23:28.480 --> 23:34.480\nYou know, I was sitting here waiting to go on and I started looking up and I was like, I like the theater.\n\n23:34.480 --> 23:42.480\nIt's like, it was like this beautiful theater and they said, no, we can put some new shit right over that beautiful old architecture and take care of that.\n\n23:42.480 --> 23:44.480\nThis is LA.\n\n23:44.480 --> 23:50.480\nSo I opened for Nirvana, yeah, yeah, which people are always surprised.\n\n23:50.480 --> 23:54.480\nI met Nirvana before they broke.\n\n23:54.480 --> 24:02.480\nKurt was a fan of mine and he interviewed me on an Ann Arbor, yeah, on a college radio station.\n\n24:02.480 --> 24:04.480\nHe wanted to meet me.\n\n24:04.480 --> 24:06.480\nIt's really weird and quiet, it's like finding out that.\n\n24:06.480 --> 24:08.480\nThat's fine here though, that's fine.\n\n24:08.480 --> 24:10.480\nNo, it's just fascinating.\n\n24:10.480 --> 24:12.480\nNo, it's like fine here.\n\n24:12.480 --> 24:16.480\nDid you say Kurt Cobain interviewed you on an Ann Arbor, Michigan radio station?\n\n24:16.480 --> 24:18.480\nThere's a college station, yeah.\n\n24:18.480 --> 24:20.480\nWow.\n\n24:20.480 --> 24:24.480\nSo he was moonlighting as a college radio DJ during Nirvana?\n\n24:24.480 --> 24:28.480\nNo, but it was funny because he wanted to meet me, so that's how it was put together.\n\n24:28.480 --> 24:32.480\nBut it's funny because he was quiet and kind of mumbly and then, you know, I'm going like...\n\n24:32.480 --> 24:38.480\nAnd so it was really an audible interview, you know.\n\n24:38.480 --> 24:44.480\nBut people, when they find that out, it's like finding out that Jimmy Hendrix really liked Buddy Hackett, you know.\n\n24:44.480 --> 24:48.480\nThey really can't wrap their brains around it.\n\n24:48.480 --> 24:50.480\n15 cities opening for Nirvana, but it was...\n\n24:50.480 --> 24:52.480\nWow.\n\n24:52.480 --> 24:58.480\nA lot of comics I was like, oh, you know, worried about bombing, but that never really bothered me.\n\n24:58.480 --> 25:02.480\nYou're being set up to bomb if you're a comic opening for a band.\n\n25:02.480 --> 25:04.480\nNo one's there.\n\n25:04.480 --> 25:08.480\nBut I also kind of enjoyed that part of it, you know what I mean?\n\n25:08.480 --> 25:10.480\nHow did you do overall?\n\n25:10.480 --> 25:12.480\nWas it usually...\n\n25:12.480 --> 25:16.480\nYou can't even hear him laughing, right?\n\n25:16.480 --> 25:20.480\nIt was about every third show ago, okay.\n\n25:20.480 --> 25:28.480\nThe first show I did was in Chicago right after Michael Jordan had retired from basketball.\n\n25:28.480 --> 25:36.480\nAnd myself and the Nirvanas knew as much about sports as you do, although I didn't even watch the football show yesterday.\n\n25:36.480 --> 25:42.480\nI didn't really watch it, but I saw the names of the teams and then someone brought shots over.\n\n25:42.480 --> 25:48.480\nAnother guy that's in my cell phone came over and that's always bad news and I woke up 5 p.m. the next day.\n\n25:48.480 --> 25:50.480\nI'm sorry to interrupt you, please.\n\n25:50.480 --> 25:52.480\nNo, no, no.\n\n25:52.480 --> 25:54.480\nLook, if you're bored with me, I know how these stories end.\n\n25:54.480 --> 25:56.480\nNo, no.\n\n25:56.480 --> 25:58.480\nI'm not bored with you.\n\n25:58.480 --> 26:00.480\nThis is the story I want to hear, the one that you're cheering up.\n\n26:00.480 --> 26:08.480\nOh, so it was in Chicago and it was like 4,000 Nirvana fans and Michael Jordan had retired from basketball.\n\n26:08.480 --> 26:14.480\nAnd I went out and I wouldn't do this now because I actually understand that everybody has feelings now.\n\n26:14.480 --> 26:19.480\nBut I went out and I said, hey, Chicago, how are you?\n\n26:19.480 --> 26:25.480\nI feel bad for Michael Jordan, but for $40 million a year, I'd shoot my own dad in the fucking head.\n\n26:25.480 --> 26:31.480\nAnd there was this noise that wasn't even that grown.\n\n26:31.480 --> 26:38.480\nIn my mind, when I retell a story, the pits stop moving.\n\n26:38.480 --> 26:43.480\nI actually got hit with a teenager once when I was doing the show.\n\n26:43.480 --> 26:46.480\nWhen you do something like that, you're not sitting backstage.\n\n26:46.480 --> 26:49.480\nMaybe there's a 5 minute period backstage.\n\n26:49.480 --> 26:52.480\nDo you see that shit flying off of my walrus beard?\n\n26:52.480 --> 27:00.480\nFor you and the podcast audience, there's shit flying off of my beard and mustache and I haven't trimmed for 30 days.\n\n27:00.480 --> 27:04.480\nYou're in the wings and maybe in your head you're going like, I think I'll do this.\n\n27:04.480 --> 27:08.480\nBut are you also thinking about their reaction or are you thinking like...\n\n27:08.480 --> 27:11.480\nIf I know the truth, I never told this part of that story.\n\n27:11.480 --> 27:16.480\nI actually said that to Kurt as I was walking in the stage.\n\n27:16.480 --> 27:18.480\nI said $40 million, I'd shoot my own dad in the fucking head.\n\n27:18.480 --> 27:24.480\nAnd then I went out there and I said it and afterwards he goes, I can't believe you said that.\n\n27:24.480 --> 27:31.480\nWhen you said it to him, did he go like, you got to do that on stage?\n\n27:31.480 --> 27:32.480\nNo, no, no.\n\n27:32.480 --> 27:34.480\nKurt Cobain impression that I'm working on?\n\n27:34.480 --> 27:35.480\nI don't know.\n\n27:35.480 --> 27:40.480\nYou got to do that on the stage, Bob Goldway.\n\n27:40.480 --> 27:44.480\nIf Kurt Cobain was a horny bear, that's what that sounded like.\n\n27:44.480 --> 27:47.480\nWhere's Bob Cobain on stage?\n\n27:47.480 --> 27:50.480\nA horny rubby's on my dick.\n\n27:50.480 --> 27:57.480\nActually, I remember when I got off, he was truly like the only one laughing in the venue.\n\n27:57.480 --> 27:59.480\nHe was behind an amp.\n\n27:59.480 --> 28:06.480\nHave you ever gone on stage and told the Kurt Cobain blowing his head off you?\n\n28:06.480 --> 28:07.480\nMyself?\n\n28:07.480 --> 28:08.480\nYeah.\n\n28:08.480 --> 28:09.480\nOh, no.\n\n28:09.480 --> 28:10.480\nI'm kidding, of course.\n\n28:10.480 --> 28:11.480\nOh, you mean...\n\n28:11.480 --> 28:17.480\nThat story comes full circle in a terrible way, is what I'm saying.\n\n28:17.480 --> 28:26.480\nYeah, I feel like a bus you go by right now with his name on it to really bum me out all the way, Jeff.\n\n28:26.480 --> 28:27.480\nHey, look at me from this angle.\n\n28:27.480 --> 28:28.480\nLook at me from this angle.\n\n28:28.480 --> 28:32.480\nJust from that angle.\n\n28:32.480 --> 28:33.480\nJust that specific angle.\n\n28:33.480 --> 28:38.480\nI think his most amazing power was that the amount of women he banged.\n\n28:38.480 --> 28:39.480\nOh, man.\n\n28:39.480 --> 28:41.480\nThat's the real David Blaine magic.\n\n28:41.480 --> 28:48.480\nSo, why are you out there on the road? Why did I run into you in my underwear after yelling at my girlfriend at a hotel?\n\n28:48.480 --> 28:49.480\nYeah.\n\n28:49.480 --> 28:51.480\nThat was a nice icebreaker.\n\n28:51.480 --> 28:53.480\nI don't know why.\n\n28:53.480 --> 28:55.480\nWell, you guys were fighting in the room.\n\n28:55.480 --> 28:56.480\nCould you hear us?\n\n28:56.480 --> 28:57.480\nOh, yeah.\n\n28:57.480 --> 28:58.480\nYou could hear me?\n\n28:58.480 --> 28:59.480\nYeah.\n\n28:59.480 --> 29:00.480\nYou said you couldn't that night.\n\n29:00.480 --> 29:01.480\nI heard you when I walked in.\n\n29:01.480 --> 29:03.480\nWhen I came down the hall, I heard you fighting.\n\n29:03.480 --> 29:04.480\nOh, fuck me.\n\n29:04.480 --> 29:07.480\nI mean, the documentary crew...\n\n29:07.480 --> 29:08.480\nI gaged it.\n\n29:08.480 --> 29:10.480\nI was like, is this 911?\n\n29:10.480 --> 29:11.480\nNo, this is just fucking...\n\n29:11.480 --> 29:12.480\nNo, this is just...\n\n29:12.480 --> 29:13.480\nThey're just rehashing shit.\n\n29:13.480 --> 29:14.480\nYeah.\n\n29:14.480 --> 29:15.480\nYeah.\n\n29:15.480 --> 29:16.480\nCo-dependent.\n\n29:16.480 --> 29:17.480\nBecause the people next to us was more...\n\n29:17.480 --> 29:18.480\nThey were more of a dick in the ass.\n\n29:18.480 --> 29:19.480\nThat woman that came out and yelled at us.\n\n29:19.480 --> 29:21.480\nShe had to go autistic kids or something, yeah.\n\n29:21.480 --> 29:23.480\nIt sounded like she was skinning an autistic kid.\n\n29:23.480 --> 29:25.480\nIt was just like...\n\n29:25.480 --> 29:28.480\nI was like...\n\n29:28.480 --> 29:30.480\nI just put my babies to bed.\n\n29:30.480 --> 29:32.480\nI go, whatever you're calling it, lady.\n\n29:32.480 --> 29:36.480\nBut remember, she yelled at us for being in the hall.\n\n29:36.480 --> 29:37.480\nYeah, yeah.\n\n29:37.480 --> 29:38.480\nShe did.\n\n29:38.480 --> 29:39.480\nThat was the outrageous thing.\n\n29:39.480 --> 29:41.480\nI was yelling at my girlfriend.\n\n29:41.480 --> 29:43.480\nI was doing my Kevin Spacey.\n\n29:43.480 --> 29:44.480\nI call it my Kevin Spacey.\n\n29:44.480 --> 29:45.480\nI like the fact that...\n\n29:45.480 --> 29:49.480\nYou, a family, an 80s comedian, Bobcat Goldway,\n\n29:49.480 --> 29:51.480\nand I'm the only one not screaming.\n\n29:51.480 --> 29:56.480\nWhy am I the quiet one here?\n\n29:56.480 --> 29:57.480\nYeah, why am I the one?\n\n29:57.480 --> 30:01.480\nHey, man, we can all just, you know, keep it cool, all right?\n\n30:01.480 --> 30:04.480\nIf my career has taught you anything, it's...\n\n30:04.480 --> 30:08.480\nThat is hysterical.\n\n30:08.480 --> 30:10.480\nWell, I've never put that together.\n\n30:10.480 --> 30:16.480\nYou used to be famous for screaming.\n\n30:16.480 --> 30:20.480\nThat's a testament to how cool you've become in your recent career.\n\n30:20.480 --> 30:22.480\nThat's another thing I wanted to ask you about.\n\n30:22.480 --> 30:27.480\nYour films, I feel like there must be something you do as a director.\n\n30:27.480 --> 30:30.480\nThis is going to sound like I'm just kissing your ass because you're here.\n\n30:30.480 --> 30:34.480\nBut I always wanted to ask you if there's something you do with your actors\n\n30:34.480 --> 30:38.480\nbecause I don't want to bag on Robin Williams.\n\n30:38.480 --> 30:41.480\nHe's a comedian, icon, national treasure, blah, blah, blah.\n\n30:41.480 --> 30:45.480\nBut I don't think he'd cry if he heard another person say,\n\n30:45.480 --> 30:49.480\nyeah, he's never really on my cup of tea on screen as a dramatic actor.\n\n30:49.480 --> 30:52.480\nBut then your movie, where in that first actor,\n\n30:52.480 --> 30:54.480\nhe's relating to that kid who eventually,\n\n30:54.480 --> 30:57.480\nautomatically asphyxiates himself and like...\n\n30:57.480 --> 30:58.480\nSpoiler alert.\n\n30:58.480 --> 31:00.480\nYeah, well, that's the first plot plan.\n\n31:00.480 --> 31:02.480\nLook, if you haven't seen it, who cares?\n\n31:02.480 --> 31:03.480\nThe kid dies jerking off.\n\n31:03.480 --> 31:05.480\nFather of the Year.\n\n31:05.480 --> 31:06.480\nWorld's Greatest Dad.\n\n31:06.480 --> 31:07.480\nWorld's Greatest Goddamn Dad.\n\n31:07.480 --> 31:09.480\nThis is the third time I've done that, too.\n\n31:09.480 --> 31:10.480\nBut what is Father of the Year?\n\n31:10.480 --> 31:11.480\nIs that a...\n\n31:11.480 --> 31:13.480\nThat must be some movie with...\n\n31:13.480 --> 31:14.480\nBilly Crystal or something.\n\n31:14.480 --> 31:15.480\nI think, yeah.\n\n31:15.480 --> 31:16.480\nOh, Jesus.\n\n31:16.480 --> 31:17.480\nNo, that's Father's Day.\n\n31:17.480 --> 31:18.480\nFather's Day?\n\n31:18.480 --> 31:19.480\nI don't fucking know.\n\n31:19.480 --> 31:21.480\nWell, let's make a movie called Father of the Year\n\n31:21.480 --> 31:24.480\nso that I stop being wrong about it when I ask you about it.\n\n31:24.480 --> 31:25.480\nSequel?\n\n31:25.480 --> 31:27.480\nHey, let me a flashback.\n\n31:27.480 --> 31:29.480\nOh, remember before my kid died,\n\n31:29.480 --> 31:34.480\nit'd be like the Muppet Babies of auto-erotic fiction.\n\n31:34.480 --> 31:38.480\nI found Robin Williams absolutely resonant\n\n31:38.480 --> 31:41.480\nand relatable and compelling in that movie.\n\n31:41.480 --> 31:43.480\nNot only is it the first time I liked him\n\n31:43.480 --> 31:45.480\nin a long time as a dramatic actor,\n\n31:45.480 --> 31:49.480\nbut it's the first time that I've ever seen a story\n\n31:49.480 --> 31:51.480\nabout a dad of a teenage kid.\n\n31:51.480 --> 31:52.480\nI'm 40 years old now.\n\n31:52.480 --> 31:55.480\nI should have had a kid a long time ago.\n\n31:55.480 --> 31:56.480\nI'll probably have one at some point.\n\n31:56.480 --> 31:58.480\nYou listening?\n\n31:58.480 --> 32:01.480\nNot if you keep yelling at her.\n\n32:01.480 --> 32:03.480\nNo, are you kidding me?\n\n32:03.480 --> 32:04.480\nThat makes her eggs drop.\n\n32:04.480 --> 32:05.480\nYeah, I'm sure that is.\n\n32:05.480 --> 32:06.480\nI'm sure that is.\n\n32:06.480 --> 32:07.480\nWe're like cats.\n\n32:07.480 --> 32:08.480\nIt's like the barbed penis.\n\n32:08.480 --> 32:11.480\nAgain, I wasn't nervous for either of your safety\n\n32:11.480 --> 32:12.480\nwhen I heard the fighting shit.\n\n32:12.480 --> 32:14.480\nIt's just a weight-trash mating dance.\n\n32:14.480 --> 32:16.480\nIt was like so played out your argument.\n\n32:16.480 --> 32:18.480\nAt one point, I heard you go, line.\n\n32:18.480 --> 32:24.480\nJust your off-book and your confusing meeting.\n\n32:24.480 --> 32:25.480\nIt's a dive out of a curtain.\n\n32:25.480 --> 32:26.480\nYeah, that's all right.\n\n32:26.480 --> 32:29.480\nI did you a favor the day I met you.\n\n32:29.480 --> 32:32.480\nOh, I did you a favor the day I met you.\n\n32:32.480 --> 32:35.480\nNow you want more?\n\n32:35.480 --> 32:42.480\nBut I will strangle you with this plastic thing\n\n32:42.480 --> 32:44.480\nthat holds six packs together.\n\n32:44.480 --> 32:46.480\nYou're a fish to me.\n\n32:46.480 --> 32:50.480\nSo if we were...\n\n32:50.480 --> 32:54.480\nIf you were in a movie with me right now,\n\n32:54.480 --> 32:56.480\nDan, that was really good.\n\n32:56.480 --> 32:57.480\nLet's just do it again.\n\n32:57.480 --> 33:00.480\nAnd we have mics.\n\n33:00.480 --> 33:04.480\nEverybody can hear you.\n\n33:04.480 --> 33:06.480\nThat is often the note I get from...\n\n33:06.480 --> 33:07.480\nWell, from me, you know?\n\n33:07.480 --> 33:09.480\nI mean, I always thought I had to make\n\n33:09.480 --> 33:11.480\nthe craft service people laugh, you know?\n\n33:11.480 --> 33:15.480\nSo I was like, I do still say that I'm a really bad actor.\n\n33:15.480 --> 33:17.480\nAnd I think maybe part of that,\n\n33:17.480 --> 33:19.480\nif people do like the movies I make,\n\n33:19.480 --> 33:20.480\nyou know, you can ask Marin.\n\n33:20.480 --> 33:21.480\nI just worked with him.\n\n33:21.480 --> 33:23.480\nI don't know if I did anything for him.\n\n33:23.480 --> 33:25.480\nI'm not going to ask Marin anything.\n\n33:25.480 --> 33:29.480\nHe's going to go...\n\n33:29.480 --> 33:32.480\nBut, you know, Robin and I have been friends.\n\n33:32.480 --> 33:33.480\nMarc Maron, everybody.\n\n33:33.480 --> 33:34.480\nThere we go.\n\n33:34.480 --> 33:36.480\nMarc Maron to the stage.\n\n33:36.480 --> 33:38.480\nJust come on up, Mason.\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:40.480\nYeah, let's get him up here.\n\n33:40.480 --> 33:42.480\nMarc Maron.\n\n33:42.480 --> 33:45.480\nYo, yo, it's Marc Maron.\n\n33:45.480 --> 33:48.480\nYo, Marc Maron, why you staring?\n\n33:48.480 --> 33:50.480\nIs your mama rocking chairing?\n\n33:50.480 --> 33:52.480\nGonna fuck her like Sherrod Stone.\n\n33:52.480 --> 33:56.480\nI gave your mama my bone to Marc Maron.\n\n33:56.480 --> 33:58.480\nMrs. Marin got alone,\n\n33:58.480 --> 34:01.480\nbut not for long when I came to her house.\n\n34:01.480 --> 34:04.480\nI put my waddle weenie in her like a shit was a mouse.\n\n34:04.480 --> 34:07.480\nIt went peep peep peep and could I get some cheese?\n\n34:07.480 --> 34:09.480\nMy name is Marisa Marin.\n\n34:09.480 --> 34:11.480\nCould I have some more, please?\n\n34:11.480 --> 34:14.480\nHarmon's dick is going to make you pregnant.\n\n34:14.480 --> 34:16.480\nNothing's going to rhyme with that.\n\n34:16.480 --> 34:19.480\nThat's the end.\n\n34:19.480 --> 34:20.480\nHello, Mark.\n\n34:20.480 --> 34:21.480\nHey.\n\n34:21.480 --> 34:22.480\nIs this Vine?\n\n34:22.480 --> 34:24.480\nAre you vining me?\n\n34:24.480 --> 34:27.480\nI got to tell my mom to listen to this.\n\n34:27.480 --> 34:29.480\nI didn't know it was mine.\n\n34:29.480 --> 34:31.480\nThose ones are going to tell my mother to listen to you.\n\n34:31.480 --> 34:32.480\nThat's very nice.\n\n34:32.480 --> 34:38.480\nI thought vining was actually putting your penis in the foreground of a photo.\n\n34:38.480 --> 34:40.480\nThat's like a...\n\n34:40.480 --> 34:44.480\nSo, there's a lot of motherfucking going on in your rap.\n\n34:44.480 --> 34:49.480\nI am not soft on mamas when I rap.\n\n34:49.480 --> 34:52.480\nI don't get to use the n-word, so I just fill...\n\n34:52.480 --> 34:55.480\nMy styrofoam peanut is fuck your mama.\n\n34:55.480 --> 34:57.480\nSo, that's your analogy for the n-word?\n\n34:57.480 --> 34:58.480\nIs your mother?\n\n34:58.480 --> 34:59.480\nNo, I'm just saying.\n\n34:59.480 --> 35:01.480\nIf I could use the n-word, my rap should be filled with it.\n\n35:01.480 --> 35:03.480\nThat's why he's the master, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n35:03.480 --> 35:04.480\nBam.\n\n35:04.480 --> 35:05.480\nRight?\n\n35:05.480 --> 35:07.480\nBoiled it down.\n\n35:07.480 --> 35:11.480\nSo, your mother's looking for the n-word.\n\n35:11.480 --> 35:13.480\nHe's the Barbara Walters of comics.\n\n35:13.480 --> 35:17.480\nI'm not sure I like that so much.\n\n35:17.480 --> 35:19.480\nI saw that written about you, and I thought that was...\n\n35:19.480 --> 35:21.480\nI immediately knew that you wouldn't have like that.\n\n35:21.480 --> 35:23.480\nSo, that was amazing.\n\n35:23.480 --> 35:27.480\nI'm an annoying Jewish woman of podcasting?\n\n35:27.480 --> 35:29.480\nAll right, I'll take it.\n\n35:29.480 --> 35:34.480\nI've always saw him as the Daelus Reigns of...\n\n35:34.480 --> 35:37.480\nI'm glad I'm not the only person who didn't get that reference.\n\n35:37.480 --> 35:40.480\nFamous Orange Weatherman from California.\n\n35:40.480 --> 35:41.480\nOkay, okay.\n\n35:41.480 --> 35:43.480\nGood job on getting the mic.\n\n35:43.480 --> 35:46.480\nThat only took a few minutes.\n\n35:46.480 --> 35:50.480\nI leaned over, and I went like...\n\n35:50.480 --> 35:51.480\nI gave a couple of hands.\n\n35:51.480 --> 35:52.480\nNo, it feels better now.\n\n35:52.480 --> 35:53.480\nI appreciate it.\n\n35:53.480 --> 35:54.480\nFor a while, that was wow.\n\n35:54.480 --> 35:56.480\nYou want to know about Bob's directing style?\n\n35:56.480 --> 35:57.480\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n35:57.480 --> 35:59.480\nHe directed four episodes of my show.\n\n35:59.480 --> 36:03.480\nWhich I saw the pilot for, which I'm really looking...\n\n36:03.480 --> 36:04.480\nYeah, we talked about it.\n\n36:04.480 --> 36:05.480\nIt was great.\n\n36:05.480 --> 36:06.480\nWhat Bob will do is he'll let you run the scene,\n\n36:06.480 --> 36:09.480\nand everybody will do the lines and everything.\n\n36:09.480 --> 36:12.480\nAnd then what he would do with me is he'd come over,\n\n36:12.480 --> 36:14.480\nand he'd sort of pull me aside, and he goes,\n\n36:14.480 --> 36:16.480\ndon't listen to what anyone else is saying.\n\n36:16.480 --> 36:19.480\nOkay, just do what you want to do,\n\n36:19.480 --> 36:21.480\nand I'm going to be over there.\n\n36:21.480 --> 36:25.480\nYou hear a car start.\n\n36:25.480 --> 36:26.480\nIs that right?\n\n36:26.480 --> 36:27.480\nThat's fair, yeah.\n\n36:27.480 --> 36:28.480\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n36:28.480 --> 36:30.480\nI spend most of my time when I'm directing\n\n36:30.480 --> 36:32.480\ntrying to find a chair.\n\n36:32.480 --> 36:34.480\nYeah.\n\n36:34.480 --> 36:36.480\nTalked to me by the great Richard Donner.\n\n36:36.480 --> 36:39.480\nActually, I was in Scrooge that he directed\n\n36:39.480 --> 36:40.480\nand a Tales from the Crypt.\n\n36:40.480 --> 36:42.480\nHe's like, kid, you want to learn how to direct?\n\n36:42.480 --> 36:44.480\nI go, yeah.\n\n36:44.480 --> 36:45.480\nAnd he goes, come on my trailer.\n\n36:45.480 --> 36:46.480\nUh-oh.\n\n36:46.480 --> 36:47.480\nYeah.\n\n36:47.480 --> 36:49.480\nI'm not falling for that again.\n\n36:49.480 --> 36:50.480\nNo.\n\n36:50.480 --> 36:54.480\nAnd so he says, he just throws me a pillow,\n\n36:54.480 --> 36:56.480\nand he goes, take a lot of naps.\n\n36:56.480 --> 36:58.480\nIt's a true story.\n\n36:58.480 --> 37:00.480\nI go, really?\n\n37:00.480 --> 37:02.480\nAnd that's why he got fired off of Superman, too.\n\n37:02.480 --> 37:03.480\nYeah.\n\n37:03.480 --> 37:05.480\nThat's what I was told writers, like young writers,\n\n37:05.480 --> 37:07.480\nyou have any advice for young writers?\n\n37:07.480 --> 37:08.480\nGo take a nap.\n\n37:08.480 --> 37:09.480\nYou're young.\n\n37:09.480 --> 37:11.480\nDon't wake up until the pressure's on.\n\n37:11.480 --> 37:14.480\nYou sit at the computer, and you look at the screen\n\n37:14.480 --> 37:16.480\nuntil you go, fuck.\n\n37:16.480 --> 37:17.480\nAnd then you jerk off.\n\n37:17.480 --> 37:18.480\nYeah.\n\n37:18.480 --> 37:20.480\nAnd then you take a nap.\n\n37:20.480 --> 37:21.480\nIsn't that writing?\n\n37:21.480 --> 37:23.480\nI mean, am I misunderstanding it?\n\n37:23.480 --> 37:26.480\nGet as short a deadline as you possibly can\n\n37:26.480 --> 37:28.480\nfrom anyone that's willing to pay you for anything,\n\n37:28.480 --> 37:30.480\nbecause if they give you nine months,\n\n37:30.480 --> 37:33.480\nyou will find out what happens to your body\n\n37:33.480 --> 37:37.480\nif you masturbate for eight months in three weeks.\n\n37:37.480 --> 37:40.480\nYou will see a penis.\n\n37:40.480 --> 37:45.480\nI passed that line 20 years ago.\n\n37:45.480 --> 37:51.480\nAll this is explained to you in the WGA Guild books.\n\n37:51.480 --> 37:55.480\nJust a bunch of photos of writer's dicks.\n\n37:55.480 --> 37:59.480\nA bunch of photos of writer's dicks.\n\n37:59.480 --> 38:00.480\nDo you want me to...\n\n38:00.480 --> 38:02.480\nA mac and cheese on the stove.\n\n38:02.480 --> 38:03.480\nI'm sorry.\n\n38:03.480 --> 38:05.480\nNo, I don't want to step on anything,\n\n38:05.480 --> 38:08.480\nbut I talked to you before the show,\n\n38:08.480 --> 38:10.480\nand I've got this story\n\n38:10.480 --> 38:12.480\nthat is such a classic show business story\n\n38:12.480 --> 38:14.480\nthat I've been gifted with.\n\n38:14.480 --> 38:17.480\nI never expected this to happen in my life,\n\n38:17.480 --> 38:21.480\nand I've got like a classic show business story.\n\n38:21.480 --> 38:23.480\nI think this is the place to do it,\n\n38:23.480 --> 38:24.480\nif anyone here wants to hear...\n\n38:24.480 --> 38:27.480\nA classic...\n\n38:27.480 --> 38:30.480\nBecause it also addresses your question about interviewing,\n\n38:30.480 --> 38:33.480\nbecause it all comes around to this.\n\n38:33.480 --> 38:34.480\nBy the way, this is what I want.\n\n38:34.480 --> 38:37.480\nI brought Marc Maron here because I wanted to...\n\n38:37.480 --> 38:39.480\nWell, trick people into buying tickets,\n\n38:39.480 --> 38:41.480\nbut also I wanted to ask him,\n\n38:41.480 --> 38:43.480\nbecause I just finished his podcast tour,\n\n38:43.480 --> 38:45.480\nlike, I'm a terrible interviewer.\n\n38:45.480 --> 38:47.480\nThis is like my weakest skill, right, Jeff?\n\n38:47.480 --> 38:48.480\nAfter rap.\n\n38:48.480 --> 38:49.480\nYeah.\n\n38:49.480 --> 38:51.480\nI think he's excellent at rap.\n\n38:51.480 --> 38:52.480\nHe is, he's alright.\n\n38:52.480 --> 38:53.480\nYeah.\n\n38:53.480 --> 38:55.480\nInterviewing is no easy task,\n\n38:55.480 --> 38:57.480\ngoing to fuck your mama so hard.\n\n38:57.480 --> 38:58.480\nPussy needs a blast.\n\n38:58.480 --> 38:59.480\nAlright, alright.\n\n38:59.480 --> 39:00.480\nHe was...\n\n39:00.480 --> 39:01.480\nWhat'd I do?\n\n39:01.480 --> 39:03.480\nWhat'd I do?\n\n39:03.480 --> 39:05.480\nYeah, the thing was going to be,\n\n39:05.480 --> 39:08.480\nI was going to ask Marin how do you interview people,\n\n39:08.480 --> 39:10.480\nas the Barbara Walters of comedians.\n\n39:10.480 --> 39:11.480\nWell, I don't know about that,\n\n39:11.480 --> 39:12.480\nbut here's what happens.\n\n39:12.480 --> 39:16.480\nSo, I get an opportunity to interview Mel Brooks.\n\n39:16.480 --> 39:17.480\nOkay?\n\n39:17.480 --> 39:19.480\nNow, right, it went up today,\n\n39:19.480 --> 39:20.480\nand if you listen to it,\n\n39:20.480 --> 39:21.480\nyou heard half of this story,\n\n39:21.480 --> 39:22.480\nyou haven't heard the whole story.\n\n39:22.480 --> 39:23.480\nSo now, Mel Brooks,\n\n39:23.480 --> 39:26.480\nthere's nothing he hasn't said publicly about his life,\n\n39:26.480 --> 39:27.480\nthat he has worked into a shtick,\n\n39:27.480 --> 39:29.480\nand that he's gotten laughs with.\n\n39:29.480 --> 39:30.480\nIt's all out there.\n\n39:30.480 --> 39:31.480\nI did research,\n\n39:31.480 --> 39:33.480\nI watched all the old dick-cava shows,\n\n39:33.480 --> 39:34.480\nI watched the new dick-cava interview,\n\n39:34.480 --> 39:37.480\nI watched him interviewed by some English guy.\n\n39:37.480 --> 39:39.480\nI listened to a whole episode of The Nerdist.\n\n39:39.480 --> 39:41.480\nAlright, that's how far I went.\n\n39:41.480 --> 39:42.480\nWow!\n\n39:42.480 --> 39:44.480\nAnd I say that with love,\n\n39:44.480 --> 39:47.480\nand so I put a resentment and contempt.\n\n39:47.480 --> 39:49.480\nThat's the triangle for me,\n\n39:49.480 --> 39:52.480\nthat's the triad.\n\n39:52.480 --> 39:54.480\nSo, my problem was,\n\n39:54.480 --> 39:56.480\nhow am I going to talk to Mel Brooks\n\n39:56.480 --> 39:57.480\nand get something out of him\n\n39:57.480 --> 39:59.480\nthat he hasn't said before,\n\n39:59.480 --> 40:01.480\nand really connect with him as a person?\n\n40:01.480 --> 40:03.480\nSo, I realized going in,\n\n40:03.480 --> 40:04.480\nthis would be the advice,\n\n40:04.480 --> 40:05.480\nI don't know if you can take this advice,\n\n40:05.480 --> 40:06.480\nmy first thought was like,\n\n40:06.480 --> 40:08.480\nI'm a Jew.\n\n40:08.480 --> 40:09.480\nIt's alright.\n\n40:09.480 --> 40:10.480\nI'm a Jew.\n\n40:10.480 --> 40:11.480\nWelcome to the Egyptian.\n\n40:11.480 --> 40:13.480\nHe's a Jew.\n\n40:13.480 --> 40:16.480\nYeah, we used to...\n\n40:16.480 --> 40:17.480\nThank you.\n\n40:17.480 --> 40:18.480\nThis place is beautiful.\n\n40:18.480 --> 40:19.480\nNo, we did a lot of work for them.\n\n40:19.480 --> 40:20.480\nWe did a lot of work for them.\n\n40:20.480 --> 40:23.480\nSome of the greatest Jewish artifacts are Egyptian.\n\n40:23.480 --> 40:24.480\nWe're going to put you in a basket\n\n40:24.480 --> 40:26.480\nand a river after the show.\n\n40:26.480 --> 40:27.480\nThat would be fine.\n\n40:27.480 --> 40:30.480\nI hope that his mother finds me.\n\n40:30.480 --> 40:32.480\nSo I can fuck her.\n\n40:32.480 --> 40:34.480\nThe...\n\n40:34.480 --> 40:35.480\nBoom.\n\n40:35.480 --> 40:36.480\nHuh?\n\n40:36.480 --> 40:37.480\nWest side.\n\n40:37.480 --> 40:38.480\nAlright, so I figure I'll just go\n\n40:38.480 --> 40:40.480\nfull Jew with Mel.\n\n40:40.480 --> 40:42.480\nThat's why I just...\n\n40:42.480 --> 40:43.480\nLiterally, I got in there\n\n40:43.480 --> 40:44.480\nwithin five minutes,\n\n40:44.480 --> 40:45.480\nI'm talking like this.\n\n40:45.480 --> 40:46.480\nWhat, are you kidding me?\n\n40:46.480 --> 40:47.480\nOf course, you know.\n\n40:47.480 --> 40:48.480\nNew podcast,\n\n40:48.480 --> 40:49.480\nfull Jew with Mel.\n\n40:49.480 --> 40:50.480\nFull Jew with Mel.\n\n40:50.480 --> 40:52.480\nBut I've seen that happen to you\n\n40:52.480 --> 40:54.480\nwhen we had a kindler on the show.\n\n40:54.480 --> 40:56.480\nI haven't sort of...\n\n40:56.480 --> 40:59.480\nIf you've got payas, do it like that.\n\n40:59.480 --> 41:01.480\nIt's really weird.\n\n41:01.480 --> 41:03.480\nThat was a good moment on the show.\n\n41:03.480 --> 41:05.480\nThat was fucking hilarious.\n\n41:05.480 --> 41:06.480\nJudd Hirsch plays my dad.\n\n41:06.480 --> 41:08.480\nMy dad's a bipolar lunatic, alright?\n\n41:08.480 --> 41:10.480\nSo they get Judd Hirsch to play him.\n\n41:10.480 --> 41:12.480\nAnd my concern was Judd Hirsch is a little too...\n\n41:12.480 --> 41:13.480\nHey, how are you? I'm cute.\n\n41:13.480 --> 41:14.480\nYou know, so...\n\n41:14.480 --> 41:15.480\nYou replaced what's his name with Judd Hirsch?\n\n41:15.480 --> 41:16.480\nWell, he couldn't do it.\n\n41:16.480 --> 41:17.480\nThat's awesome.\n\n41:17.480 --> 41:18.480\nJudd Hirsch is...\n\n41:18.480 --> 41:19.480\nHe's great.\n\n41:19.480 --> 41:20.480\nHe's a great actor, right?\n\n41:20.480 --> 41:21.480\nBut my fear was\n\n41:21.480 --> 41:22.480\nwhy he'd be too cute and too Jewish\n\n41:22.480 --> 41:24.480\nand not scary enough to be my father, right?\n\n41:24.480 --> 41:26.480\nSo he gets there on the first day of shooting\n\n41:26.480 --> 41:27.480\nand he's doing his Judd Hirsching.\n\n41:27.480 --> 41:28.480\nLike, hey, I'm here.\n\n41:28.480 --> 41:29.480\nWhat do we do?\n\n41:29.480 --> 41:31.480\nAnd all you guys were sitting there\n\n41:31.480 --> 41:33.480\nbehind the camera going,\n\n41:33.480 --> 41:34.480\noh, he's doing it.\n\n41:34.480 --> 41:35.480\nUh-oh.\n\n41:35.480 --> 41:36.480\nOh, boy.\n\n41:36.480 --> 41:37.480\nIndependence Day.\n\n41:37.480 --> 41:38.480\nRight.\n\n41:38.480 --> 41:39.480\nAnd then there was that moment where I'm like,\n\n41:39.480 --> 41:40.480\nhe's an actor.\n\n41:40.480 --> 41:41.480\nGo tell him to be scary.\n\n41:41.480 --> 41:42.480\nAnd then you went over there\n\n41:42.480 --> 41:43.480\nand I think you said,\n\n41:43.480 --> 41:46.480\nJudd, can you turn down the Jew a little bit?\n\n41:46.480 --> 41:48.480\nIs that what you said?\n\n41:48.480 --> 41:49.480\nYes.\n\n41:49.480 --> 41:50.480\nCan you...\n\n41:50.480 --> 41:54.480\nCould you just leaven it one quarter inch?\n\n41:54.480 --> 41:55.480\nCould you just...\n\n41:55.480 --> 41:58.480\nCould you just snip a little bit off the end of it?\n\n41:58.480 --> 41:59.480\nEnd of it?\n\n41:59.480 --> 42:00.480\nOr snip less, right?\n\n42:00.480 --> 42:01.480\nI don't know.\n\n42:01.480 --> 42:02.480\nThat always confused me.\n\n42:02.480 --> 42:04.480\nNo, because I always...\n\n42:04.480 --> 42:07.480\nWhat do I say about this?\n\n42:07.480 --> 42:09.480\nHe was great, by the way.\n\n42:09.480 --> 42:10.480\nOh, you know, my favorite part of that was\n\n42:10.480 --> 42:12.480\nwe got done with that episode and you go,\n\n42:12.480 --> 42:15.480\nMary goes, um...\n\n42:15.480 --> 42:19.480\nI think my real dad's gonna sue me.\n\n42:19.480 --> 42:22.480\nAnd I go, he should.\n\n42:22.480 --> 42:24.480\nThat may happen.\n\n42:24.480 --> 42:25.480\nNo, Brooks.\n\n42:25.480 --> 42:27.480\nI don't want to take up all your time.\n\n42:27.480 --> 42:28.480\nYeah, tell the story.\n\n42:28.480 --> 42:29.480\nFull Jew.\n\n42:29.480 --> 42:30.480\nFull Jew.\n\n42:30.480 --> 42:31.480\nSo I talk to Mel Brooks.\n\n42:31.480 --> 42:32.480\nI'm talking to him.\n\n42:32.480 --> 42:33.480\nWe're getting along.\n\n42:33.480 --> 42:34.480\nWe're hitting it off.\n\n42:34.480 --> 42:35.480\nThere's a couple of great moments in the podcast.\n\n42:35.480 --> 42:36.480\nOne that is now actually on the podcast.\n\n42:36.480 --> 42:37.480\nMel Brooks looks at me and he goes,\n\n42:37.480 --> 42:39.480\nI'm gonna give you something exclusive.\n\n42:39.480 --> 42:41.480\nAnd I'm like, fucking great.\n\n42:41.480 --> 42:43.480\nHe goes, I'm at the Fox Commissary.\n\n42:43.480 --> 42:46.480\nI see Gene Wilder sitting with a legal pad.\n\n42:46.480 --> 42:47.480\nAnd I walk up to him and I go,\n\n42:47.480 --> 42:48.480\nwhat are you writing, Gene?\n\n42:48.480 --> 42:49.480\nHe goes, Young Frankenstein.\n\n42:49.480 --> 42:50.480\nIt's an outline for a movie.\n\n42:50.480 --> 42:51.480\nAnd Mel Brooks says...\n\n42:51.480 --> 42:52.480\nHe says, I said to Gene,\n\n42:52.480 --> 42:54.480\nI said, we're gonna do that movie.\n\n42:54.480 --> 42:56.480\nAnd Gene said, you gotta get me out here.\n\n42:56.480 --> 42:58.480\nMel Brooks said, I'll get you out here.\n\n42:58.480 --> 43:01.480\nAnd Gene says, I want a cottage at that.\n\n43:01.480 --> 43:05.480\nAnd then Mel Brooks goes, what the hell is that hotel?\n\n43:05.480 --> 43:06.480\nWhat's that hotel?\n\n43:06.480 --> 43:07.480\nAnd I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n43:07.480 --> 43:09.480\nYou know that it's a hotel.\n\n43:09.480 --> 43:10.480\nIt's in Bel Air.\n\n43:10.480 --> 43:11.480\nIt's a hotel.\n\n43:11.480 --> 43:13.480\nAnd I go, Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\n43:13.480 --> 43:16.480\nHe goes, no, it's in Bel Air.\n\n43:16.480 --> 43:18.480\nHold on a minute.\n\n43:18.480 --> 43:19.480\nI'll get it.\n\n43:19.480 --> 43:21.480\nAnd then he stands up and he goes to the door\n\n43:21.480 --> 43:22.480\nwhere his assistant is.\n\n43:22.480 --> 43:24.480\nHe goes, what is that hotel?\n\n43:24.480 --> 43:26.480\nIt's in Bel Air.\n\n43:26.480 --> 43:27.480\nIt's on that street.\n\n43:27.480 --> 43:28.480\nWhat is it called?\n\n43:28.480 --> 43:30.480\nAnd I hear the assistant go, I don't know.\n\n43:30.480 --> 43:32.480\nHe's like, look it up on the thing.\n\n43:32.480 --> 43:35.480\nAll right, so I hear her clicking away.\n\n43:35.480 --> 43:38.480\nAnd he goes, it's in Bel Air.\n\n43:38.480 --> 43:40.480\nAnd she goes, is it the Bel Air Hotel?\n\n43:40.480 --> 43:41.480\nThat's it.\n\n43:41.480 --> 43:42.480\nThe Bel Air Hotel.\n\n43:42.480 --> 43:43.480\nWow.\n\n43:43.480 --> 43:45.480\nAnd he comes in, he sits down.\n\n43:45.480 --> 43:47.480\nHe wants a room at the Bel Air Hotel.\n\n43:47.480 --> 43:49.480\nHe wants a supply of Earl Grey

45:11.480\nAnd I go, it's in the parking.\n\n45:11.480 --> 45:13.480\nI go, yeah, I'll walk you to your car.\n\n45:13.480 --> 45:14.480\nSo I'm walking with Mel Brooks.\n\n45:14.480 --> 45:15.480\nIt's a kid's fear.\n\n45:15.480 --> 45:16.480\nRight.\n\n45:16.480 --> 45:19.480\nExactly.\n\n45:19.480 --> 45:20.480\nLadies and gentlemen, Mel Brooks.\n\n45:20.480 --> 45:21.480\nIt's hilarious.\n\n45:21.480 --> 45:23.480\nYou would love him to be here.\n\n45:23.480 --> 45:24.480\nSo then we walk to the parking.\n\n45:24.480 --> 45:25.480\nHe goes, which car is it?\n\n45:25.480 --> 45:27.480\nAnd I go, it's a camera.\n\n45:27.480 --> 45:28.480\nHe goes, and he points at a Bentley.\n\n45:28.480 --> 45:29.480\nHe goes, oh, I thought this was it.\n\n45:29.480 --> 45:32.480\nWhy did I walk you out here?\n\n45:32.480 --> 45:34.480\nAnd he goes, which camera?\n\n45:34.480 --> 45:35.480\nI go, it's that one.\n\n45:35.480 --> 45:36.480\nI walk over to the car.\n\n45:36.480 --> 45:37.480\nI'm like, thank you, Mel Brooks.\n\n45:37.480 --> 45:38.480\nAnd Mr. Brooks.\n\n45:38.480 --> 45:45.480\nAnd he goes, no, I'm going to watch you put your stuff in your car.\n\n45:45.480 --> 45:48.480\nSo I put the stuff in the car and he goes, you should have a talk show.\n\n45:48.480 --> 45:49.480\nAnd I'm like, make those calls.\n\n45:49.480 --> 45:50.480\nHe goes, you talk to Carl.\n\n45:50.480 --> 45:51.480\nRight.\n\n45:51.480 --> 45:52.480\nAll right.\n\n45:52.480 --> 45:54.480\nSo he sets up Carl.\n\n45:54.480 --> 45:55.480\nSo I go to Carl's house.\n\n45:55.480 --> 45:56.480\nThere's a whole other series.\n\n45:56.480 --> 45:58.480\nThere's a whole other Jewish experience.\n\n45:58.480 --> 46:00.480\nI go to Carl's house.\n\n46:00.480 --> 46:04.480\nI'm greeted by his nephew and manager, George Shapiro, who's in his 70s.\n\n46:04.480 --> 46:05.480\nAll right.\n\n46:05.480 --> 46:08.480\nCarl is going to be 91.\n\n46:08.480 --> 46:09.480\nSo George should.\n\n46:09.480 --> 46:10.480\nYeah, right.\n\n46:10.480 --> 46:11.480\nGeorge Shapiro comes.\n\n46:11.480 --> 46:12.480\nHe greets me.\n\n46:12.480 --> 46:13.480\nHe talks about sign for five minutes.\n\n46:13.480 --> 46:14.480\nThere's a publicist there.\n\n46:14.480 --> 46:15.480\nThere's a chair, a couch.\n\n46:15.480 --> 46:19.480\nAnd then Carl comes down and he sits in a chair and I mic him up with the boom.\n\n46:19.480 --> 46:20.480\nRight.\n\n46:20.480 --> 46:21.480\nAnd we start talking.\n\n46:21.480 --> 46:22.480\nRight.\n\n46:22.480 --> 46:24.480\nAnd I say, so you and Mel hang out every night.\n\n46:24.480 --> 46:26.480\nI heard he says, he comes over here every night.\n\n46:26.480 --> 46:27.480\nWe hang out.\n\n46:27.480 --> 46:28.480\nI'm like, what do you do?\n\n46:28.480 --> 46:30.480\nHe goes, it has to do with chicken feathers.\n\n46:30.480 --> 46:31.480\nMaybe I'll tell you.\n\n46:31.480 --> 46:32.480\nFine.\n\n46:32.480 --> 46:36.480\nSo I'm sitting there talking to Carl for like an hour.\n\n46:36.480 --> 46:40.480\nWhile I'm talking to Carl, George Shapiro is in a chair directly across from us the entire\n\n46:40.480 --> 46:43.480\ntime he's in and out of this.\n\n46:43.480 --> 46:48.480\nBut when I finish the interview, Shapiro is the first one to get up and go, God, that\n\n46:48.480 --> 46:49.480\nwas great.\n\n46:49.480 --> 46:50.480\nThat was a great interview.\n\n46:50.480 --> 46:51.480\nAll right.\n\n46:51.480 --> 46:53.480\nA couple of things happen real quick.\n\n46:53.480 --> 46:56.480\nYeah, I'm getting to the punch line.\n\n46:56.480 --> 46:57.480\nYou're doing fine.\n\n46:57.480 --> 47:01.480\nIn the middle of the interview, he says, did you see that show on PBS about the Jews and\n\n47:01.480 --> 47:02.480\nthe Broadway musicals?\n\n47:02.480 --> 47:04.480\nHow many Jews were involved in Broadway musicals?\n\n47:04.480 --> 47:05.480\nI go ahead and see it.\n\n47:05.480 --> 47:08.480\nHe goes, I never knew there were so many Jews involved in Broadway musicals.\n\n47:08.480 --> 47:10.480\nThere's a whole list at the end.\n\n47:10.480 --> 47:11.480\nYou got to see it.\n\n47:11.480 --> 47:12.480\nI'll show it to you after the interview.\n\n47:12.480 --> 47:16.480\nI'm like, fine.\n\n47:16.480 --> 47:18.480\nSo we finish this fucking interview.\n\n47:18.480 --> 47:21.480\nI talked to him for like an hour and 15 minutes and then he starts, he says, I'm going to\n\n47:21.480 --> 47:22.480\nshow you the thing.\n\n47:22.480 --> 47:25.480\nHe starts playing with remote controls to find the thing on the Tivo, right?\n\n47:25.480 --> 47:27.480\nGeorge Shapiro goes, is there ice cream?\n\n47:27.480 --> 47:30.480\nAll right.\n\n47:30.480 --> 47:35.480\nShapiro goes and he gets a box of ice cream sandwiches and he hands everyone an ice cream\n\n47:35.480 --> 47:36.480\nsandwich.\n\n47:36.480 --> 47:39.480\nSo now, now we're eating ice cream sandwiches.\n\n47:39.480 --> 47:41.480\nCarl is figuring out the Tivo.\n\n47:41.480 --> 47:43.480\nI want to be Jewish.\n\n47:43.480 --> 47:46.480\nI want to be 90.\n\n47:46.480 --> 47:51.480\nSo he finally figures the Tivo out and he starts the documentary at the beginning.\n\n47:51.480 --> 47:54.480\nSo now I'm sitting there with an ice cream sandwich and I'm going to have to sit here\n\n47:54.480 --> 47:56.480\nfor a fucking hour and watch the whole thing.\n\n47:56.480 --> 47:59.480\nI mean, it's familiar to me, but it's also a little peculiar, right?\n\n47:59.480 --> 48:04.480\nSo we're watching that and I'm just sitting there and we're eating the ice cream.\n\n48:04.480 --> 48:08.480\nAnd yeah, I'm like, yeah, George Gershwin and we're talking and then the phone rings\n\n48:08.480 --> 48:11.480\nand I see Carl pick it up and I'm putting my shit away.\n\n48:11.480 --> 48:12.480\nAnd he goes, hello?\n\n48:12.480 --> 48:13.480\nYes, it was great.\n\n48:13.480 --> 48:14.480\nIt went very well.\n\n48:14.480 --> 48:15.480\nYes.\n\n48:15.480 --> 48:21.480\nAnd he holds the phone out and he looks at me and he goes, it's Mel.\n\n48:21.480 --> 48:23.480\nSo I pick up the phone.\n\n48:23.480 --> 48:24.480\nI go, hello?\n\n48:24.480 --> 48:27.480\nAnd all I hear is 80%, right?\n\n48:27.480 --> 48:32.480\nThe butler did it.\n\n48:32.480 --> 48:34.480\nDavid Butler did it.\n\n48:34.480 --> 48:36.480\nHe did it in the butt.\n\n48:36.480 --> 48:40.480\nAnd then I said to Carl, you know, I said, I said to Mel, I said, maybe 85.\n\n48:40.480 --> 48:43.480\nAnd he goes, all right, maybe 85.\n\n48:43.480 --> 48:46.480\nPut Carl back on the microphone.\n\n48:46.480 --> 48:48.480\nSo then on the microphone.\n\n48:48.480 --> 48:49.480\nYeah.\n\n48:49.480 --> 48:51.480\nAnd then Carl hangs up the phone.\n\n48:51.480 --> 48:53.480\nThey talk about chicken for a few minutes.\n\n48:53.480 --> 48:55.480\nThey can't hear, so they have a microphone on the telephone.\n\n48:55.480 --> 48:56.480\nI know.\n\n48:56.480 --> 48:57.480\nI think he was just being cute.\n\n48:57.480 --> 48:58.480\nSo then I forget that, Mike.\n\n48:58.480 --> 49:00.480\nI forget to ask him about the feathers.\n\n49:00.480 --> 49:01.480\nWhat's the chicken feathers?\n\n49:01.480 --> 49:02.480\nWhat are you and Mel?\n\n49:02.480 --> 49:03.480\nWhat is that about?\n\n49:03.480 --> 49:04.480\nHe goes, all right.\n\n49:04.480 --> 49:05.480\nYou want to know?\n\n49:05.480 --> 49:06.480\nYeah.\n\n49:06.480 --> 49:08.480\nAnd he points to the publicist who's on the couch.\n\n49:08.480 --> 49:10.480\nHe goes, oh, you got a pillow behind you?\n\n49:10.480 --> 49:11.480\nCan you feel anything?\n\n49:11.480 --> 49:12.480\nJust give me the pillow.\n\n49:12.480 --> 49:15.480\nSo this guy hands Carl the pillow.\n\n49:15.480 --> 49:16.480\nAnd Carl is sitting down.\n\n49:16.480 --> 49:23.480\nHe puts the pillow on his lap and very delicately starts running his hand over this pillow like this.\n\n49:23.480 --> 49:24.480\nAnd then he goes, ooh.\n\n49:24.480 --> 49:27.480\nAnd he pulls a feather out of the pillow, right?\n\n49:27.480 --> 49:29.480\nLike a down feather, you know?\n\n49:29.480 --> 49:32.480\nAnd he puts it, and he very delicately puts it on the armrest.\n\n49:32.480 --> 49:35.480\nAnd he says, I put these in a bag.\n\n49:35.480 --> 49:37.480\nI've got a lot of them.\n\n49:37.480 --> 49:38.480\nYeah.\n\n49:38.480 --> 49:42.480\nAnd he goes, I don't know what I'm going to do with them, but I got a lot of them.\n\n49:42.480 --> 49:45.480\nAnd then he starts running his hand over the pillow again.\n\n49:45.480 --> 49:48.480\nI go, what's this have to do with you sitting here for hours with Mel Brooks?\n\n49:48.480 --> 49:52.480\nHe goes, this is what we do.\n\n49:52.480 --> 49:55.480\nMarc Maron, everybody.\n\n49:55.480 --> 49:58.480\nThat was a new cement called the full Jew.\n\n49:58.480 --> 49:59.480\nYeah.\n\n49:59.480 --> 50:00.480\nThe full Jew.\n\n50:00.480 --> 50:01.480\nHilarious.\n\n50:01.480 --> 50:02.480\nA new segment.\n\n50:02.480 --> 50:05.480\nWe're going to bring Maron back every week and do the full Jew.\n\n50:05.480 --> 50:07.480\nIf he can stay in with these guys.\n\n50:07.480 --> 50:08.480\nAre you kidding?\n\n50:08.480 --> 50:11.480\nI could do that any night of the week.\n\n50:11.480 --> 50:19.480\nSo I think we got a sneak hint of it, but I did want to ask, is there anything specific\n\n50:19.480 --> 50:25.480\nthat you said Bob to Robin Williams on that set that resulted in me going, holy shit,\n\n50:25.480 --> 50:31.480\nthat guy's me instead of the guy from Hook instead of the guy from Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\n50:31.480 --> 50:32.480\nYeah.\n\n50:32.480 --> 50:36.480\nI pulled him aside and I said, don't be so Jewish.\n\n50:36.480 --> 50:38.480\nThat's what I say to every actor.\n\n50:38.480 --> 50:39.480\nOkay.\n\n50:39.480 --> 50:40.480\nOkay.\n\n50:40.480 --> 50:41.480\nOkay, Bobby.\n\n50:41.480 -->

afraid.\n\n50:57.480 --> 50:58.480\nI gotta stand up like this now.\n\n50:58.480 --> 50:59.480\nLike this.\n\n50:59.480 --> 51:00.480\nNope.\n\n51:00.480 --> 51:01.480\nOh.\n\n51:01.480 --> 51:03.480\nBoth of you can fucking cram it.\n\n51:03.480 --> 51:04.480\nHere's how it goes.\n\n51:04.480 --> 51:05.480\nUh-oh.\n\n51:05.480 --> 51:06.480\nDueling.\n\n51:06.480 --> 51:07.480\nDueling Williams.\n\n51:07.480 --> 51:12.480\nThat was wonderful.\n\n51:12.480 --> 51:15.480\nDrop the mic.\n\n51:15.480 --> 51:17.480\nDrop the mic.\n\n51:17.480 --> 51:20.480\nBob can't go through it, everybody.\n\n51:20.480 --> 51:21.480\nYeah.\n\n51:21.480 --> 51:24.480\nThat seems like a good exit for both of you.\n\n51:24.480 --> 51:29.480\nBobcat Goldwaite and Marc Maron came to Harmontown.\n\n51:29.480 --> 51:30.480\nThank you.\n\n51:30.480 --> 51:31.480\nI'm sorry.\n\n51:31.480 --> 51:32.480\nI smell like an onion.\n\n51:32.480 --> 51:34.480\nNo, you do too.\n\n51:34.480 --> 51:39.480\nSo awesome.\n\n51:39.480 --> 51:40.480\nThat was wonderful.\n\n51:40.480 --> 51:41.480\nThat was beautiful.\n\n51:41.480 --> 51:42.480\nNo, no, no.\n\n51:42.480 --> 51:43.480\nYeah.\n\n51:43.480 --> 51:44.480\nMr. Happy.\n\n51:44.480 --> 51:47.480\nThis isn't a cup.\n\n51:47.480 --> 51:48.480\nIt's a hat.\n\n51:48.480 --> 51:50.480\nDon't be afraid.\n\n51:50.480 --> 51:51.480\nDon't be afraid.\n\n51:51.480 --> 51:54.480\nOh, so many people out there.\n\n51:54.480 --> 51:59.480\nOh, so I feel like my dick could fuck everybody.\n\n51:59.480 --> 52:00.480\nLet's see.\n\n52:00.480 --> 52:01.480\nI can't do it.\n\n52:01.480 --> 52:02.480\nHe's magic.\n\n52:02.480 --> 52:07.480\nCan we get Spencer Crittenden into the stage, please?\n\n52:07.480 --> 52:08.480\nSpencer.\n\n52:08.480 --> 52:16.480\nJudgent master to the stars.\n\n52:16.480 --> 52:19.480\nStoryteller extraordinaire.\n\n52:19.480 --> 52:24.480\nHe approaches the stage, clad in red flannel.\n\n52:24.480 --> 52:28.480\nHis beard is both inviting and repellent.\n\n52:28.480 --> 52:35.480\nHe is the master of all worlds, inhabitant of none.\n\n52:35.480 --> 52:40.480\nSpencer, Creighton Dinsen, friend.\n\n52:40.480 --> 52:44.480\nHis name was improvised by Chevy Chase.\n\n52:44.480 --> 52:48.480\nSpencer, Creighton Dinsen.\n\n52:48.480 --> 52:50.480\nSpencer, welcome back to Los Angeles, man.\n\n52:50.480 --> 52:55.480\nBy the way, what a fucking asshole move that was.\n\n52:55.480 --> 52:59.480\nRewind, edit that out, say that again, and go.\n\n52:59.480 --> 53:01.480\nSpencer, welcome back to Los Angeles.\n\n53:01.480 --> 53:04.480\nYou know what I love about cookies?\n\n53:04.480 --> 53:09.480\nA booyah, booyah, everybody booyah.\n\n53:09.480 --> 53:12.480\nA booyah, booyah rap, special booyah rap.\n\n53:12.480 --> 53:15.480\nGot a booyah rap about the word booyah.\n\n53:15.480 --> 53:18.480\nA booyah, booyah.\n\n53:18.480 --> 53:20.480\nDo it again, do it again, do it again.\n\n53:20.480 --> 53:21.480\nFor real, I won't do it again.\n\n53:21.480 --> 53:24.480\nSpencer, it's great to see you back in Los Angeles, man.\n\n53:24.480 --> 53:27.480\nIt's good to be back in Los Angeles.\n\n53:27.480 --> 53:29.480\nWhat can I say?\n\n53:29.480 --> 53:30.480\nYeah.\n\n53:30.480 --> 53:34.480\nAlthough, you're from, what, more parks in the valley?\n\n53:34.480 --> 53:36.480\nYeah, more park.\n\n53:36.480 --> 53:38.480\nJason to see me valley.\n\n53:38.480 --> 53:41.480\nSo you don't really call Los Angeles like a Hollywood home.\n\n53:41.480 --> 53:43.480\nYou're a visitor here more or less, aren't you?\n\n53:43.480 --> 53:46.480\nI'm explaining it to people who don't live in Los Angeles.\n\n53:46.480 --> 53:49.480\nI say I live outside of Los Angeles.\n\n53:49.480 --> 53:50.480\nThat's about it.\n\n53:50.480 --> 53:53.480\nThat's not even a joke.\n\n53:53.480 --> 53:57.480\nThat's my life.\n\n53:57.480 --> 53:58.480\nThat's no joke.\n\n53:58.480 --> 53:59.480\nThat's my life.\n\n53:59.480 --> 54:00.480\nYeah, man.\n\n54:00.480 --> 54:04.480\nWait, it's really staying Jewish up here.\n\n54:04.480 --> 54:05.480\nIt's fine.\n\n54:05.480 --> 54:06.480\nThat's good.\n\n54:06.480 --> 54:08.480\nSpencer, they're good people.\n\n54:08.480 --> 54:09.480\nThey're chosen people.\n\n54:09.480 --> 54:12.480\nHarmon said that he's learned nothing from this tour that we did.\n\n54:12.480 --> 54:13.480\nDid you learn anything?\n\n54:13.480 --> 54:21.480\nI learned, yeah, I learned that I'm apparently pretty great.\n\n54:21.480 --> 54:22.480\nPeople like you.\n\n54:22.480 --> 54:23.480\nI agree.\n\n54:23.480 --> 54:24.480\nYeah.\n\n54:24.480 --> 54:25.480\nThey like you just the way you are.\n\n54:25.480 --> 54:28.480\nI kept telling them not to, but it didn't stop them.\n\n54:28.480 --> 54:30.480\nYou are a contrarian by nature.\n\n54:30.480 --> 54:39.480\nYou explained to me, you constantly try to offset the weight of whatever the universe\n\n54:39.480 --> 54:40.480\nis dealing you kind of.\n\n54:40.480 --> 54:41.480\nI'm paraphrasing you.\n\n54:41.480 --> 54:47.480\nYou disagree with things for the sake of it kind of because you find that that often is\n\n54:47.480 --> 54:48.480\nneeded.\n\n54:48.480 --> 54:49.480\nYeah.\n\n54:49.480 --> 54:52.480\nIt's like if there's too many people saying a thing, I'm like, well, they must be wrong.\n\n54:52.480 --> 54:53.480\nRight.\n\n54:53.480 --> 54:54.480\nThey have to be.\n\n54:54.480 --> 54:55.480\nYeah.\n\n54:55.480 --> 54:56.480\nI agree with that.\n\n54:56.480 --> 54:59.480\nBut the dilemma is the world saying they love you.\n\n54:59.480 --> 55:00.480\nYeah.\n\n55:00.480 --> 55:01.480\nIt gets complicated.\n\n55:01.480 --> 55:02.480\nBecause they're wrong.\n\n55:02.480 --> 55:05.480\nOn one hand, they must be in your view.\n\n55:05.480 --> 55:07.480\nBut on the other hand, they outnumber you.\n\n55:07.480 --> 55:08.480\nGreat.\n\n55:08.480 --> 55:13.480\nDo you think that you made any like online or in person foes or enemies during this trip?\n\n55:13.480 --> 55:16.480\nDid you ever actually piss anybody off or rub anybody the wrong way?\n\n55:16.480 --> 55:17.480\nI don't.\n\n55:17.480 --> 55:18.480\nI hope not.\n\n55:18.480 --> 55:19.480\nI don't think so.\n\n55:19.480 --> 55:22.480\nI tried my hardest not to do that.\n\n55:22.480 --> 55:23.480\nYeah.\n\n55:23.480 --> 55:24.480\nDo you think you went on a journey?\n\n55:24.480 --> 55:27.480\nYou're probably familiar by now with my hacky story model.\n\n55:27.480 --> 55:29.480\nLike you're a dungeon master.\n\n55:29.480 --> 55:30.480\nYou're a writer.\n\n55:30.480 --> 55:31.480\nYou're a storyteller.\n\n55:31.480 --> 55:38.480\nLike, you know that I draw this circle and that I wrap all of it around it and follows\n\n55:38.480 --> 55:39.480\nthese eight steps.\n\n55:39.480 --> 55:42.480\nIt's all stolen from Joseph Campbell to field and stuff.\n\n55:42.480 --> 55:44.480\nAnd like, did you see yourself?\n\n55:44.480 --> 55:46.480\nDo you think that you went on a little journey?\n\n55:46.480 --> 55:49.480\nI mean, I didn't go like placing myself around the wheel.\n\n55:49.480 --> 55:51.480\nBut yeah, it was definitely a journey.\n\n55:51.480 --> 55:52.480\nI learned some stuff.\n\n55:52.480 --> 55:55.480\nI returned to hopefully a better person.\n\n55:55.480 --> 55:57.480\nWhat do you think changed about you?\n\n55:57.480 --> 55:58.480\nIt's different in your head.\n\n55:58.480 --> 56:02.480\nI think that before, I was really afraid of social interaction.\n\n56:02.480 --> 56:08.720\nBut you know, when you're friggin' talking to like 30 people who are mostly wasted and\n\n56:08.720 --> 56:16.480\nlike a bar like 20 times, you know, in a row, that's the worst.\n\n56:16.480 --> 56:19.480\nSo everything else, anything else is...\n\n56:19.480 --> 56:20.480\nThat's as bad as it gets.\n\n56:20.480 --> 56:21.480\nYeah.\n\n56:21.480 --> 56:24.480\nSo like literally, I was coming home and I was like, my friends want to hang out.\n\n56:24.480 --> 56:26.480\nAnd I was like, two people?\n\n56:26.480 --> 56:28.480\nThat's workable.\n\n56:28.480 --> 56:30.480\nYeah.\n\n56:30.480 --> 56:31.480\nSo...\n\n56:31.480 --> 56:35.480\nI hear our $1,000 VIPs down here talking about their character sheets.\n\n56:35.480 --> 56:37.480\nThey're discussing D&D strategies.\n\n56:37.480 --> 56:39.480\nWe have two people...\n\n56:39.480 --> 56:42.480\nWait, for $1,000, you get up on stage and play D&D?\n\n56:42.480 --> 56:43.480\nYeah, that's fucking...\n\n56:43.480 --> 56:44.480\nIt's a real deal.\n\n56:44.480 --> 56:45.480\nSpencer is a rock star.\n\n56:45.480 --> 56:48.480\nNobody would have paid $1,000 just to get up here.\n\n56:48.480 --> 56:52.480\nMerin only did it because he wants to plug his IFC show, you know?\n\n56:52.480 --> 56:54.480\nAll right, yeah, the show Merin starts in May.\n\n56:54.480 --> 56:56.480\nYou know, by the way, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n56:56.480 --> 56:58.480\nHe didn't really do it to plug it.\n\n56:58.480 --> 57:02.480\nI did see the pilot and I think he's got a straight shot at it.\n\n57:02.480 --> 57:03.480\nAnd Bobcat, we didn't plug it.\n\n57:03.480 --> 57:06.480\nWe're not really a pluggy show, but Bobcat's new film is God Bless America, right?\n\n57:06.480 --> 57:08.480\nYeah, go check that out.\n\n57:08.480 --> 57:13.480\nAlso, shit, we should have talked to him about his Bigfoot movie, too.\n\n57:13.480 --> 57:14.480\nYou showed me...\n\n57:14.480 --> 57:19.480\nYou tried to show me the trailer for it after I abused my girlfriend and came to your hotel room\n\n57:19.480 --> 57:24.480\nand you offered me your pizza and tried to show me your trailer on the shitty Wi-Fi at the hotel.\n\n57:24.480 --> 57:27.480\nBut anyways, just Google Bob Goldthwaite.\n\n57:27.480 --> 57:28.480\nWhat's your...\n\n57:28.480 --> 57:29.480\nRelax.\n\n57:29.480 --> 57:30.480\nIt's not...\n\n57:30.480 --> 57:32.480\nIt's that goddamn 50s.\n\n57:32.480 --> 57:35.480\nJust go out there and consume his work.\n\n57:35.480 --> 57:37.480\nOut there working for you.\n\n57:37.480 --> 57:40.480\nAssholes, terrible people.\n\n57:40.480 --> 57:43.480\nIt's fitting that this place is called the Egyptian.\n\n57:43.480 --> 57:47.480\nYou're a bunch of tyrants, pharaohs.\n\n57:47.480 --> 57:48.480\nThis is the dark point of the show.\n\n57:48.480 --> 57:50.480\nThis is where it fits into the story circle.\n\n57:50.480 --> 57:52.480\nThis is the atonement.\n\n57:52.480 --> 57:54.480\nHate you.\n\n57:54.480 --> 57:56.480\nHate Jesus.\n\n57:56.480 --> 57:58.480\nHate my father.\n\n57:58.480 --> 58:00.480\nI am my father.\n\n58:00.480 --> 58:03.480\nJesus is my father.\n\n58:07.480 --> 58:10.480\nYou in the podcast, I'm ripping open my shirt.\n\n58:10.480 --> 58:11.480\nThere's blood everywhere.\n\n58:11.480 --> 58:13.480\nI'm bleeding out of my nipples.\n\n58:13.480 --> 58:15.480\nI'm pissing into a jar.\n\n58:15.480 -->

01:06:42.480\nGood to see you.\n\n01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480\nHey.\n\n01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.480\nMan, you're a good rapper.\n\n01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.480\nThank you, buddy.\n\n01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.480\nHi.\n\n01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.480\nDuncan has an amazing podcast that everyone should listen to.\n\n01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.480\nI was a guest on it.\n\n01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.480\nI listened to that episode.\n\n01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.480\nAnd loved it.\n\n01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480\nAnd loved you.\n\n01:06:53.480 --> 01:07:05.480\nWe had a big talk about robots and the future of sperm.\n\n01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.480\nOh, yeah, man.\n\n01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.480\nWe got into the singularity.\n\n01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.480\nAnd we really hit, you know, that wall you hit sometimes where you run out of words.\n\n01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.480\nAnd you're just sort of stumbling around.\n\n01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.480\nThat's my favorite place to get to.\n\n01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.480\nWe definitely got there.\n\n01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.480\nIt's a place called Love.\n\n01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.480\nI love you.\n\n01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.480\nI love you.\n\n01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.480\nAnd we vowed to be best friends on that podcast, but we don't really hang out.\n\n01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.480\nBut, you know, you locked yourself in the bathroom and I came over.\n\n01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.480\nOh, yeah, you saved me.\n\n01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.480\nThat's right.\n\n01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.480\nI forgot.\n\n01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.480\nThat was such a humiliating, but awesome moment.\n\n01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480\nI did what I could.\n\n01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.480\nI locked myself in my bathroom at my house.\n\n01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.480\nI was taking a dump.\n\n01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.480\nForgive me for saying that.\n\n01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:47.480\nAnd I, uh, I live in this old house and it just, the door just locked.\n\n01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.480\nIt's just like Amadeville horror style locked.\n\n01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.480\nAnd it's the mid, it's summer.\n\n01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.480\nIt was summer and it was so hot in there.\n\n01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.480\nAnd I started hearing the narrator from those death shows in my head.\n\n01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:05.480\nLike, he didn't realize this would be the last dump he ever took in his life.\n\n01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.480\nThey found him two weeks later.\n\n01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.480\nCalling out the window to neighbors.\n\n01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.480\nYeah, that's how I ended up.\n\n01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.480\nThat's the really say when you're locked in your bathroom, what do you call out of the window?\n\n01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.480\nDo you say help?\n\n01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.480\nOr is that too much?\n\n01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:19.480\nI would go, that's too much.\n\n01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.480\nI don't want to think I'm on fire.\n\n01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.480\nI'll live.\n\n01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.480\nI'm alone.\n\n01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:29.480\nI live alone and I'm alone.\n\n01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:32.480\nThis is, this is something that happens to geriatrics.\n\n01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.480\nIt's like, that's an elderly death.\n\n01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.480\nThat's where the cat chews your face off style.\n\n01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.480\nI'm 12 years older than my girlfriend.\n\n01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.480\nAnd we were, we saw a billboard for the, for the life alert thing.\n\n01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.480\nAnd by the way, their slogan is I've fallen and I can't get up and it's trademarked now.\n\n01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:54.480\nWhich is like a weird thing because that's a person dying.\n\n01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:59.480\nWe know that's, that's a famous saying from your thing, but it's not like where's the beef?\n\n01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.480\nIt's like I've fallen and I can't get up.\n\n01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.480\nThat's not, I've fallen.\n\n01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.480\nI'm dying.\n\n01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.480\nYou're trademarking the most common thing you hear if you're a 911 dispatcher.\n\n01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.480\nYeah, like, I don't know.\n\n01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.480\nI don't know what's funny about it.\n\n01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480\nI know it's just funny.\n\n01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.480\nIt's like the opposite of trademarking the birthday song.\n\n01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:22.480\nBut we started joking about how I should get one of those because I'm 12 years older than her.\n\n01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.480\nAnd then the joke turned into sincere.\n\n01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:29.480\nIt's good if you got one that might help.\n\n01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.480\nThose commercials are so existentially horrifying.\n\n01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.480\nThere's a line in one of those commercials.\n\n01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:42.480\nThis old lady says, I live alone and I don't get many visitors.\n\n01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.480\nIt's like the worst, worst way to end up.\n\n01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.480\nWell, we're born into these bodies and then we're like, like a whole,\n\n01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.480\nso you use a brain and then there's the puppet and the puppets made of meat.\n\n01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:55.480\nAnd then there's maybe a God or maybe there isn't somewhere in between.\n\n01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.480\nNo idea what's going to happen when we die.\n\n01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.480\nWe just know that it's going to be a drag when we do.\n\n01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:00.480\nIt's not going to be fun.\n\n01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.480\nNo one ever has fun when they die.\n\n01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.480\nNobody.\n\n01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.480\nOh, I know Steve Job said, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, or whatever.\n\n01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.480\nBut I think he was like, oh, whoa, this hurts.\n\n01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.480\nLike, or wow.\n\n01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:16.480\nWe don't, I don't think, I think, I don't think death is that bad a thing at all.\n\n01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.480\nThat's what I'm fishing for.\n\n01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.480\nMy recent running with cancer made me think that it's, it's not.\n\n01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.480\nWell, for one, the one thing you realize is that this is not new terrain.\n\n01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:33.480\nLike you realize there's this well worn path into oblivion that they've worked out for us already.\n\n01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.480\nLike other humans or humans.\n\n01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.480\nYeah, like just the medical system.\n\n01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.480\nI mean, dying is so good these days.\n\n01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.480\nThe drugs are so good.\n\n01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.480\nThe narcotics are incredible.\n\n01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.480\nYou're going to, Steve Job said, wow, wow, wow.\n\n01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.480\nBecause he was on Dilaudid and narcotics.\n\n01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.480\nAnd then maybe he saw God or something.\n\n01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:00.480\nBut there's this thing Ramadan says, which I've thought about a lot.\n\n01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.480\nWhich he says, dying is safe.\n\n01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.480\nAnd it's, it is, it's like the very safe thing.\n\n01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.480\nIt's the most normal thing that can happen outside of being born.\n\n01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.480\nThat is true because like rocks are dead.\n\n01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.480\nThey're everywhere.\n\n01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.480\nLike aluminum is dead.\n\n01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.480\nIt's the most abundant element in the Earth's crust.\n\n01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.480\nIt's like no big deal to be dead.\n\n01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.480\nYeah, it isn't a big, it isn't a big deal.\n\n01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.480\nIt's a, I mean, thank goodness we.\n\n01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.480\nIt's as easy as falling off a log in a very specific angle that will, that snaps your neck.\n\n01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.480\nIt's preferable to living forever.\n\n01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.480\nYeah, probably.\n\n01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.480\nBecause forever would be, yeah.\n\n01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.480\nThere is no, I mean, it's one of those things that like, like we always, you know,\n\n01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.480\neverybody in this room is at least 25 or whatever they've all been down this road of like,\n\n01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.480\nokay, yeah, yeah, yeah, because you're a human being.\n\n01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.480\nSo if life wasn't scarce, then it wouldn't be valuable.\n\n01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.480\nYou wouldn't enjoy it and all that stuff.\n\n01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.480\nBut it's like, it's one of those things like what your mom says,\n\n01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.480\noh, those guys that beat you up shouldn't be your friends anyway.\n\n01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:01.480\nLike, like you, you hear it, but hearing it and understanding it are separate\n\n01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.480\nfrom like realizing it in your heart.\n\n01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.480\nYes.\n\n01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.480\nLike really getting it.\n\n01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.480\nLike, like, like that whole concept of like, well, you're alive and you're going to die\n\n01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.480\nand, and it sucks that you're going to die.\n\n01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:17.480\nBut because it sucks that you're going to die, your life is valuable.\n\n01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.480\nOtherwise it wouldn't be because you'd just be hanging out.\n\n01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.480\nLike you'd just be like Highlander, like, like fucking around.\n\n01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.480\nThe sun's going to supernova.\n\n01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.480\nYou're going to be floating through the void of space screaming for infinity,\n\n01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.480\nlike one of those probes.\n\n01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.480\nWell, if you're immortal, so does that cat, so that you would do the sun would supernova\n\n01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.480\nand you'd just be a dude floating around?\n\n01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480\nWhere are you going to stand?\n\n01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.480\nSo you just speak.\n\n01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.480\nOur son would read giant first and envelop us.\n\n01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.480\nWe'd all, we'd all cook.\n\n01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.480\nYou'd have to be on a ship.\n\n01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:47.480\nI'm assuming you're immortal and you have like your skin doesn't burn.\n\n01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.480\nRight, it doesn't burn.\n\n01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.480\nSo I'm just imagining.\n\n01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.480\nSo you're just hanging out.\n\n01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.480\nYou're just, it's the ultimate horror would be to be immortal.\n\n01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.480\nAnd then you just, hey, you're just standing in space like Space Ghost.\n\n01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.480\nYeah.\n\n01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.480\nLike waiting for, all right.\n\n01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.480\nAnd then you start walking like in Minecraft.\n\n01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:05.480\nLike it's just no end, like you just like, I don't know when I'm ever going to find\n\n01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.480\nanother planet.\n\n01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:09.480\nAnd then when you do, everyone's like, Hey, who are you?\n\n01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.480\nAnd you're like, my name's Ted and I can't die.\n\n01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.480\nAnd they're like, fuck you.\n\n01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.480\nNo, you don't say, you don't say anything when you run.\n\n01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480\nYou open an antique store.\n\n01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480\nAfter six.\n\n01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.480\nAnd you wear a trench coat.\n\n01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.480\nYou walk around New York being bitter.\n\n01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.480\nThey start a religion about you.\n\n01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.480\nYou become a shitty deity.\n\n01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.480\nAnd you'd be over it.\n\n01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.480\nYou'd hate it.\n\n01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.480\nYeah.\n\n01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.480\nLike everything would be, yeah, nothing would be exciting.\n\n01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.480\nYou'd never be able to love anyone.\n\n01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:37.480\nWell, this is Alan Watts idea where he says, if you live forever, you would try everything\n\n01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:42.480\nthat you could try till eventually, if you were God, you'd be like, oh, I wonder what\n\n01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.480\nit's like to be mortal.\n\n01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:47.480\nAnd that's when you pop into this body and become Dan Harmon.\n\n01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.480\nHuh.\n\n01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.480\nOr Highlander.\n\n01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.480\nOr Highlander.\n\n01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:56.480\nBut that is the, that's the idea is that, that we're sort of like the way we have to\n\n01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:02.480\nsleep or we'll go crazy in the same way, like we're what happens when God falls asleep.\n\n01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:09.480\nWe think that we're impermanent mortal beings because the state of pure immortality for\n\n01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.480\neternity, there's nothing more horrifying and claustrophobic.\n\n01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:17.480\nSo we're kind of what happens when God has a nervous breakdown and shatters into an infinite\n\n01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.480\nnumber of nodes of consciousness.\n\n01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.480\nYeah.\n\n01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:26.480\nAnd in the beginning there was nothing and then nothing is fucking dumb and has forever\n\n01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.480\nto be something.\n\n01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480\nYes.\n\n01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.480\nSo it did because otherwise it would have gone nuts and what, and did.\n\n01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.480\nIt did.\n\n01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.480\nSo it's split into Duncan Trussell and Dan Harmon and Spencer and Jeff and maybe a little\n\n01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.480\nbit of Adam Goldberg.\n\n01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.480\nAnd it just like looks, we just look at ourselves.\n\n01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.480\nIt's just God like rubbing himself in a mirror.\n\n01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.480\nYeah.\n\n01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.480\nYeah.\n\n01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.480\nIt looked good in the sailor outfit.\n\n01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.480\nOh yeah.\n\n01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.480\nLike every person's a little finger and like, yeah.\n\n01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:58.480\nBut then the merciful Bob Goldthwaite of eternity comes and just shoes you off into nothing\n\n01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.480\nthis again.\n\n01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.480\nI'm afraid he's going to bounce me.\n\n01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.480\nMe too.\n\n01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.480\nI never knew the mayor of McCheese had like, I never thought of him as a mayor.\n\n01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.480\nIt really is.\n\n01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.480\nHe has power.\n\n01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.480\nGive me something to get.\n\n01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.480\nRonald, Ronald, Ronald's in charge.\n\n01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.480\nNo.\n\n01:15:13.480 -->

this.\n\n01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.480\nRonald's a fucking clown.\n\n01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.480\nHe's like a tool of the state.\n\n01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.480\nMayor McCheese is like, he barely says anything.\n\n01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.480\nI got shit to do.\n\n01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.480\nHe's like Dick Cheney.\n\n01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.480\nHe's sitting back on.\n\n01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480\nI don't want to be president.\n\n01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480\nI don't give a fuck.\n\n01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.480\nI got a big dick and a fucking missile for a heart.\n\n01:15:33.480

01:15:46.480\ntesticular cancer.\n\n01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.480\nIs that the specific?\n\n01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.480\nWas that what you got?\n\n01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.480\nYes.\n\n01:15:49.480

the Egyptian.\n\n01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.480\nTalking about the cancer in your bones.\n\n01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.480\nIt's going to claim us all.\n\n01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.480\nIf it's not your prostate, it'll be your nuts.\n\n01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.480\nFellas.\n\n01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480\nIt's going to claim us all.\n\n01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.480\nIf it's not your prostate, it'll

balls.\n\n01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.480\nWe've put on some sexy music.\n\n01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.480\nHow do you find out?\n\n01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.480\nWell.\n\n01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.480\nThey tell you to check in the shower.\n\n01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.480\nI never know what that means.\n\n01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.480\nNo, you know, this is the funny thing.\n\n01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.480\nI check in the shower every time I go to the shower.\n\n01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.480\nI don't know that I'm doing it.\n\n01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.480\nI'm just doing it.\n\n01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:40.480\nThat was so stupid.\n\n01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.480\nAre you just saying I'm jerking off in the shower?\n\n01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.480\nI jerk off in the shower a lot.\n\n01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.480\nYou jerk off, you don't rub your balls.\n\n01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.480\nYes.\n\n01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.480\nSqueeze them like plate out.\n\n01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.480\nI do.\n\n01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.480\nNo one does that.\n\n01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.480\nYou don't know that.\n\n01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.480\nI love rubbing my, squeezing my balls.\n\n01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:01.480\nI'm getting such a heart of squeezing my balls.\n\n01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.480\nAnyways.\n\n01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.480\nCan you come from rubbing your balls?\n\n01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.480\nYes.\n\n01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.480\nNo, I can't.\n\n01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.480\nYes, you can.\n\n01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.480\nI think it would take like eight years.\n\n01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:20.480\nYou know, just watching like Shakespeare in love and kind of just such a slow build.\n\n01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.480\nYou have to have an imagination.\n\n01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.480\nIf you were immortal floating through space forever, how many times do you think you'd jerk off?\n\n01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.480\nYou just jerk off all the time, right?\n\n01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.480\nYeah.\n\n01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.480\nLike that's all you do.\n\n01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.480\nYou'd like fuck Nebulae.\n\n01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:40.480\nLike rub cosmic dust on your nipples.\n\n01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.480\nCancer.\n\n01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.480\nSo how do you find out?\n\n01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.480\nDo you, do you feel a pain?\n\n01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.480\nDo you feel a lump?\n\n01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.480\nDo you know one of your balls just gets really big.\n\n01:17:52.480 --> 01:18:00.480\nIt's not every like got like a lot of a concern that people have expressed behind it is just\n\n01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.480\nthis terror.\n\n01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:05.480\nAnd then they're like, now, how did you know what was it like?\n\n01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.480\nBecause, you know, balls are weird anyway.\n\n01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.480\nSo it's hard to tell if your balls are okay, no matter what, because they're always wrong.\n\n01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.480\nYeah.\n\n01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.480\nWhat, yeah.\n\n01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.480\nWhat have they ever done that looks normal?\n\n01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:22.480\nHave you ever laid in bed and watched them like fucking move around?\n\n01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.480\nIt's terrible.\n\n01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.480\nIt's terrible.\n\n01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.480\nAdjust to the temperature.\n\n01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:31.480\nThis happens to everyone, right?\n\n01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:34.480\nAre my balls a snail?\n\n01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.480\nThis is amazing.\n\n01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.480\nThey're just moving like lava.\n\n01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:42.480\nThis one goes out to the ladies in the house.\n\n01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.480\nBalls move.\n\n01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.480\nYou better get used to it.\n\n01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.480\nYou think it's fun and games to play with them, but there's a lot more to them.\n\n01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:55.480\nThey're pretty gross and weird.\n\n01:18:55.480 --> 01:19:02.480\nSo yeah, they're weird, and then they dangle, and then they don't dangle, and then they\n\n01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.480\nones lower and ones higher.\n\n01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.480\nAnd always I'm afraid they go like, the doctors go like, hey, check your balls when you're\n\n01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.480\nin the shower, just squeeze them around.\n\n01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:13.480\nLike when you went to college, there were stickers on the shower stall, like showing\n\n01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.480\nlike diagrams.\n\n01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.480\nI'm not going to do that to my balls.\n\n01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.480\nMe either.\n\n01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.480\nLike fucking squeeze them.\n\n01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:26.480\nThey wanted you to squeeze them like a thing from a discovery store.\n\n01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.480\nI'm trying to get in there.\n\n01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.480\nThat's great.\n\n01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:34.480\nI don't have cancer, but I fucking mangled my...\n\n01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:39.480\nI'm holding my balls out of protection.\n\n01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.480\nTalking about it.\n\n01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.480\nIt was no mystery for me.\n\n01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.480\nIt was like one of my balls was big.\n\n01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.480\nIt was like, this is definitely...\n\n01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.480\nAnd when you touched it, did it hurt?\n\n01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.480\nIt didn't hurt.\n\n01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:53.480\nIt was just, it was, it was weighty.\n\n01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.480\nIt was like kind of cool.\n\n01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:59.480\nIt was like, ah, look at this big ball.\n\n01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:04.480\nBut you thought, when did your mind, did your mind immediately go, okay...\n\n01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:08.480\nMy mind is always going to like, ah, this is what kills me.\n\n01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:12.480\nSo I immediately was like, oh, this is probably what kills you.\n\n01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:17.480\nAnd then I Google searched, you know, the symptoms and everything's cancer, cancer, cancer.\n\n01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.480\nAnd then I went to the doctor and the doctor's like, yeah, this is cancer.\n\n01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.480\nYou got cancer.\n\n01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.480\nDid you Google on a Friday?\n\n01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:26.480\nIt always happens to me like, I'll get a lump on my neck or something.\n\n01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.480\nAnd then I'll Google lump on neck cancer.\n\n01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.480\nLo and behold.\n\n01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.480\nNumber one hit.\n\n01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.480\nLump on neck could mean you have cancer.\n\n01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.480\nAnd I'm like, oh shit, it's Friday.\n\n01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.480\nIt's eight o'clock.\n\n01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.480\nI'll just sit here for the weekend with cancer.\n\n01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.480\nCancer eraser on my neck.\n\n01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.480\nAnd then on Monday it falls off.\n\n01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.480\nI'm like, oh, I'm Polish.\n\n01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.480\nThis is a fucking skin tag.\n\n01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:50.480\nI'm a gross fucking Shrek.\n\n01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.480\nJust have shit growing on me.\n\n01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.480\nBen Grimm.\n\n01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.480\nWhat are, what is that?\n\n01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.480\nWhat are skin tags?\n\n01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.480\nThat's a Polish thing.\n\n01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.480\nThey call them Polish moles.\n\n01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.480\nYou get skin tags.\n\n01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.480\nWait, what?\n\n01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.480\nSkin tags.\n\n01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.480\nNo shit?\n\n01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.480\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.480\nLike random shit.\n\n01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.480\nLike polyps.\n\n01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.480\nIt's a Polish thing.\n\n01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:06.480\nWow.\n\n01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.480\nIt's kind of like a polyp, yeah.\n\n01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.480\nHey guys.\n\n01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:10.480\nHey.\n\n01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.480\nOh, hey Spencer.\n\n01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:16.480\nI went to do Spencer's theme so you could do like, like.\n\n01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:21.480\nSpencer, I'm being attacked by a, a growth, a skin tag.\n\n01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:28.480\nClimbing feverishly at your neck, you try to remove the odd skin tab.\n\n01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:35.480\nA small square, maybe rounded oval, oddly colored flesh popping out of the side of your neck.\n\n01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:38.480\nAre you dying?\n\n01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.480\nProbably not, but it's weird.\n\n01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.480\nNice.\n\n01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:51.480\nIt fails to save versus your shirt collar over a weekend of drinking and then just falls\n\n01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.480\noff.\n\n01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:57.480\nPeople tell you not to pick it because it might give you cancer.\n\n01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.480\nAre you all McLeer now, Duncan?\n\n01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:04.480\nStatistically, I'm in the 95, 90 to, well, it's like between 90, there's a 10% chance\n\n01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.480\nI'm still fucked, basically.\n\n01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.480\nWhat does still fuck mean that it goes to the other ball?\n\n01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.480\nWell, no.\n\n01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:14.480\nThe cool thing about testicular cancer and.\n\n01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.480\nThe coolest thing.\n\n01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.480\nThe coolest thing.\n\n01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.480\nIt's a very lazy week.\n\n01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:25.480\nIt's like cancer with its baseball cap on backwards cancer.\n\n01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.480\nIt's like a, it's like.\n\n01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.480\nIt's cancer that shows your balls.\n\n01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.480\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:36.480\nNot ambitious enough for your brain or your pancreas.\n\n01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:44.480\nIt's a chest bumping mall shopping universal city walk kind of cancer.\n\n01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.480\nExactly.\n\n01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.480\nExactly.\n\n01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:50.480\nIt'll broaden itself when Quentin Tarantino makes it.\n\n01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.480\nI don't know what kind of cancer you got left.\n\n01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.480\nI'll take the balls, man.\n\n01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.480\nPick ball cancer if you get to pick.\n\n01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.480\nPick ball cancer because it's the most curable kind, which is why everybody says.\n\n01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.480\nCheck your balls because it's, if you catch it in time.\n\n01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.480\nWhen Lance Armstrong caught it, he was coughing up blood.\n\n01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.480\nOne of his balls was the size of an orange.\n\n01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:13.480\nHe just ignored it.\n\n01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:20.480\nHe ignored it because he was riding his bike and he was jacked up on awesome weird sports drugs and like fuck it.\n\n01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:25.480\nAnd he was like, I'm sure something I did has, you know, yeah.\n\n01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:27.480\nI ride a bike for a living.\n\n01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.480\nThat has to be related to that.\n\n01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:34.480\nBut it had gone into his brain and they still cured it, which is why everyone says check, check.\n\n01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:41.480\nBecause if you, if you catch it at the right time, like when I caught it, there's like a 95% cure rate with it.\n\n01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:46.480\nSo it's guys, all the guys stand up and reach over, put your right hand out and reach over to your neighbor.\n\n01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.480\nWe're going to do it.\n\n01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:48.480\nWe're going to do it.\n\n01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.480\nWe're going to save your neighbor's life.\n\n01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.480\nBall check.\n\n01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.480\nEverybody.\n\n01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:52.480\nYes.\n\n01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.480\nDo do what the man next to you refuses to do for himself.\n\n01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:02.480\nJust get in there and like a key chain, like pretend you're locking your car.\n\n01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.480\nThat's what they want you to do.\n\n01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:08.480\nSave a Armenian.\n\n01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.480\nFucking cancer.\n\n01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:10.480\nFuck cancer.\n\n01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.480\nYeah.\n\n01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.480\nI'm not taking a risky stance here.\n\n01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:24.480\nWell, no, if you, I read this incredible thing that cancer, they think is like a primordial version of us or something like from way, way, way back.\n\n01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.480\nIn the distant.\n\n01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:37.480\nLike I just, because cancer is a, as a stutterer, it's a society cancer is a, is a cell that goes insane.\n\n01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.480\nYeah.\n\n01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.480\nIt doesn't, doesn't play on the same team as it's.\n\n01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:44.480\nIt's Occupy Wall Street in your boss.\n\n01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.480\nIt doesn't.\n\n01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:50.480\nIt, it, it, it forgets that it's a part of a bone.\n\n01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.480\nYeah.\n\n01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.480\nAnd just goes, I'm going to try something new.\n\n01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.480\nI'm just me.\n\n01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.480\nI'm Bane.\n\n01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.480\nYeah.\n\n01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.480\nYeah.\n\n01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.480\nThe city of bone is now free.\n\n01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:01.480\nYeah.\n\n01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.480\nAnd it just, it's just a bone and then it just, yeah.\n\n01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:14.480\nAnd I guess that would be probably the precursor of like, you know, multicellular life because tissue is cells knowing how to play on a team.\n\n01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:19.480\nAnd before that we were unicellular organisms who just multiplied at all costs.\n\n01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:39.480\nSo it is kind of ironic that like, all this years later, these biological weapons called humanity, like, like fucking giant brains that have turned wolves into chihuahuas and giraffes into curiosities and fire into, you know, just more fire.\n\n01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:44.480\nBut I could go on and on.\n\n01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:54.480\nWe, we, we, we, yeah, it was like, I was, I mean, in your nuts, like one little, like, like this thing from the year six billion trillion BC goes like, surprise inward.\n\n01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.480\nYeah.\n\n01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.480\nRemember your roots, motherfucker.\n\n01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.480\nYeah.\n\n01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.480\nIt's very strange.\n\n01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:01.480\nYeah.\n\n01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.480\nIt's a very, it's a very strange disease.\n\n01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:04.480\nAnd it's very different.\n\n01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:13.480\nEvery, every different, every type is like so different that some of them should maybe have different names, which is why some respond to different types of chemo.\n\n01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:17.480\nThis type that I have responds really well to radiation, which fucking sucks.\n\n01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:24.480\nSo I don't want to, I mean, but I want to follow through this line because, okay, so you had, did you have the thing removed?\n\n01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:29.480\nI had to get my, I mean, they, that, the doctor was so eager to chop off my balls.\n\n01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:33.480\nOnce he found out I had it, he's like, we should do this on Tuesday.\n\n01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480\nI went in.\n\n01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.480\nWe should do this every week.\n\n01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.480\nFor two weeks.\n\n01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:39.480\nWe should have Bob Goldway come out.\n\n01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:44.480\nYeah. So, so yeah, they immediately, they just go, fuck that, get that, get that out.\n\n01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.480\nYeah.\n\n01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.480\nWe got to get that in.\n\n01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:48.480\nYou just came here tonight from radiation.\n\n01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.480\nWell, not, no, right.\n\n01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.480\nMy radiation ended on, on Friday, but I'm, I'm still super tired from it.\n\n01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.480\nRadiation is crazy.\n\n01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.480\nIt's the most absurd, insane.\n\n01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:07.480\nI felt like I was in a Fellini movie because they put you in this like, because they want you to feel safe.\n\n01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:12.480\nThey designed the radiation machine to look kind of sleek, like a Mercedes or something.\n\n01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:17.480\nIt looks like really fancy, but it also looks like a transformer.\n\n01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:25.480\nIt's like this living weird thing with arms that you have to lay in and they put this steel cup over your balls.\n\n01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:31.480\nAnd you have to like, push your cock into the steel cup and you're laying in this most vulnerable way.\n\n01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.480\nAnd they fucking play Celine Dion.\n\n01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.480\nNo.\n\n01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:37.480\nNo.\n\n01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.480\nYes.\n\n01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.480\nYes.\n\n01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.480\nIt's like Jacob's ladder level hell that's happening.\n\n01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:45.480\nYou're in some kind of hell dimension.\n\n01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.480\nThey build all that shit and they can't ask you what you want to hear.\n\n01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:55.480\nWell, finally, eventually I got them to play what I wanted to, but the first time you're just so horrified.\n\n01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:05.480\nThat's actually the radiation. They shoot cold play.\n\n01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.480\nThe cancer in your balls is like, I'm out of here.\n\n01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:17.480\nI heard there's a corn concert in his lungs.\n\n01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:28.480\nSworing break is over, man. Cold play showed up. Too fucking, too thoughtful. Not enough rape.\n\n01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.480\nCold.\n\n01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:35.480\nYeah, every once in a while I'll just throw in the word rape to get your reaction.\n\n01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:41.480\nCan I ask what you actually, when you took control of the playlist, what did you...\n\n01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.480\nSitar music.\n\n01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.480\nOkay, like Ravi Shankar?\n\n01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:45.480\nYes, exactly. Yeah, that's what I had.\n\n01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:50.480\nBut it didn't work, though. Nothing works. There's no good music for radiation.\n\n01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:51.480\nIt just relaxes you, yeah.\n\n01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.480\nNot at all. You're still in a machine and you're like, these things are spinning around you.\n\n01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.480\nI think that's why they probably give you Celine Dion. You didn't like her anyway.\n\n01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.480\nWe don't want to ruin your favorite band, Tori.\n\n01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.480\nYes, exactly.\n\n01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.480\nWe're not going anywhere like if Tori Amos is playing it.\n\n01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.480\nOkay, well, that's it for this album.\n\n01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.480\nWhether I make it through or not.\n\n01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:13.480\nYou don't get the kinks in there. You get Celine Dion.\n\n01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:17.480\nYour favorite song is just scratched off your life forever.\n\n01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.480\nIt's like when you get food...\n\n01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:24.480\nI got food poisoning and had a falafel. Falafels were off the list for a long time.\n\n01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.480\nYeah, yeah, I can't drink gin.\n\n01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:29.480\nDon't take the kinks into your testicle or radiation.\n\n01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:31.480\nNo, don't.\n\n01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.480\nAnd other life lessons.\n\n01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.480\nWell, thank God you're okay.\n\n01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.480\nThanks.\n\n01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:38.480\nBut they're going to tell you later...\n\n01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.480\nI'm sure it's all...\n\n01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:46.480\nYou know, one of my friends said when I told him there's a 95% chance that I'm cured.\n\n01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:52.480\nHe said, oh, well, that just means there's a 95% chance you're going to die of something else.\n\n01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:58.480\nActually, Mel Brooks just called. He gave you 80% chance.\n\n01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:04.480\nThat was...Sony told me when community got picked up for its second season, they said, congratulations.\n\n01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:09.480\nNow if you get canceled, you've wasted twice as much money.\n\n01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:11.480\nYuck.\n\n01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:14.480\nThey're a good company.\n\n01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:21.480\nThey bring good things to slow death.\n\n01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:26.480\nBut not to equate your balls with Sony or anything.\n\n01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.480\nSo all right, well, I don't know. God damn it.\n\n01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:34.480\nSo it's all a big haze. The doctors are going to let you know in the coming weeks.\n\n01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:42.480\nWell, no, I mean, I get to look forward to CT scans like three times a year for the next four years.\n\n01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.480\nSo just to make sure it hasn't spread.\n\n01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:52.480\nIt sounds terrible, man, but like really once you get like the water thrown in your face, it's not bad at all.\n\n01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:58.480\nThey kind of imagine it would recalibrate your life in a way that makes telling your landlord to fuck off easier.\n\n01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:05.480\nSo easy, man. But we're all in the exact same boat.\n\n01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:10.480\nIt's just I happen to get like a first hand glimpse of mortality.\n\n01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:15.480\nEveryone should not be afraid of telling their landlord to fuck off.\n\n01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:22.480\nYou know, you end up going deep into cliché land when you have cancer.\n\n01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:28.480\nEveryone that's well dying is like this well trod path.\n\n01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:35.480\nEveryone goes down. So the thing where they're like, man, I really like appreciate life now and like I'm so happy to be alive.\n\n01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:42.480\nAll that stuff really happens, but you don't need cancer to be happy about your life.\n\n01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:46.480\nYou just need Celine Dion.\n\n01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:53.480\nThank you.\n\n01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.480\nI'm out the back of it.\n\n01:31:55.480 --> 01:32:19.480\nThank you.\n\n01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:25.480\nFuck your mama so hard, she started to piss into a cup and I drank that shit.\n\n01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:31.480\nAnd then I rubbed it on my face in her tits and then I put my little wiener in between those things.\n\n01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:35.480\nAnd I said, fuck you, I'm going to make you sing.\n\n01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:52.480\nShe said, I'm your mama.\n\n01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:56.480\nDon't be jealous of him. You can see how much I love him.\n\n01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:00.480\nI know. The first time you met him, you had this giant kind of.\n\n01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:05.480\nI'm sure that happens to everybody. I actually have been told that happens to everybody and I get pissed at them.\n\n01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:08.480\nFuck you. It's not special.\n\n01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:13.480\nI met Duncan at a barb very briefly and said hello and I loved him. He's a lovable guy.\n\n01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:18.480\nWhat are we doing? Let's get out of here. Go hang out with Duncan Tressel.\n\n01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:20.480\nUntil he plays some D&D though.\n\n01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:32.480\nLet's bring up our guests.\n\n01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:44.480\nVIP guests that supported this show and achieved the top tier prize of playing D&D with us.\n\n01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:46.480\nLet's bring them up right now.\n\n01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:57.480\nThe guys come up. It's Sean. One of them is our old friend Sean Sakame, a.k.a. Snap the Jab.\n\n01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:00.480\nThe most offensive Twitter name in the world.\n\n01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:09.480\nBecause apparently he's half Japanese, but he doesn't look Japanese enough to have the name Snap the Jab on Twitter.\n\n01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:15.480\nYes, so Sean Sakame and Roy McClurk, everybody, the $1,000 donators. Holy shit.\n\n01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:20.480\nDiscretionary money and no idea what to do with it.\n\n01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:25.480\nRoy, let's get these guys mic'd up.\n\n01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:28.480\nI got one on the floor.\n\n01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:34.480\nAlso, I suppose, let's meet these two before we bring Aaron up.

Step to the edge of the stage so folks can see you.\n\n01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:50.480\nSean is like the Morgan, wait, what's the name of, well, I was going to say Morgan Freeman,\n\n01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:57.480\nbut his character is Lucius Fox in the Batman universe of Harmontown.\n\n01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:01.480\nThere's always like a bottle of vodka backstage at the nerd melts from Sean.\n\n01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:05.480\nWell, I mean, you give so much. It's only fair to get back.\n\n01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.480\nThank you, Sean.\n\n01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:07.480\nThank you.\n\n01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.480\nThank you.\n\n01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.480\nAnd Roy, how do you come to us?\n\n01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:14.480\nI flew here from Dallas today.\n\n01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:15.480\nLucius?\n\n01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:20.480\nYeah.

01:42:37.480\nSit like the gods you are at the Egyptian.\n\n01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:38.480\nAll right.\n\n01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:41.480\nSo Spencer, you have a tall task in front of you now.\n\n01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:43.480\nYou've got two more characters in the stage.\n\n01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.480\nThat's cool.\n\n01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:49.480\nIf you don't mind, bring us up to date on our campaign.\n\n01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:53.480\nAre you going to music?\n\n01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:56.480\nNot if you're going to be a dick about it.\n\n01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.480\nOkay.\n\n01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.480\nI have the volume down.\n\n01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.480\nOkay.\n\n01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:00.480\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:01.480\nNot possible.\n\n01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.480\nAll right.\n\n01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:05.480\nDo you want me to distribute the sheets first or at the same time as talking?\n\n01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:06.480\nI got it, man.\n\n01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.480\nAll right.\n\n01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:08.480\nWell, that one's yours, man.\n\n01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:09.480\nDo you need anything?\n\n01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:12.480\nThese are, this is your new spell list.\n\n01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.480\nThat's yours.\n\n01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.480\nWe have our sheets.\n\n01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.480\nYeah.\n\n01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:16.480\nThis is the adventure.\n\n01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:18.480\nThis is great podcast talk.\n\n01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:22.480\nLooks like in the end we're going to fight a war.\n\n01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:25.480\nWell, you can't read.\n\n01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:26.480\nIt doesn't say that.\n\n01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:29.480\nAll right, Spencer, take it away.\n\n01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:35.480\nOn the last episode, our heroes had been trapped within the deep and mystical magical\n\n01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:38.480\ninfinifish for what seemed like an eternity.\n\n01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.480\nSorry.\n\n01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:40.480\nMystical.\n\n01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:41.480\nSorry.\n\n01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.480\nWhat?\n\n01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:43.480\nMystical chasms.\n\n01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:44.480\nWho can't read now?\n\n01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.480\nThis guy.\n\n01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:46.480\nRight here.\n\n01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.480\nWho's got a tourney side of die?\n\n01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.480\nI can't read.\n\n01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.480\nI can't do math either.\n\n01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.480\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.480\nGo ahead.\n\n01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.480\nGo ahead.\n\n01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.480\nThis is my musical cue this time.\n\n01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.480\nNo, you still got it.\n\n01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.480\nAfter meeting with a village of fish-willing humans and a master swordsman named Vellicent,\n\n01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.480\nour heroes found and destroyed various organs in a quest to escape their living prison.\n\n01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:10.480\nSlipping down a slippery fight, they found a magical tome before coming on to the beast's\n\n01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.480\ngreat hearts.\n\n01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.480\nAfter a long fight, the gang was on the ropes.\n\n01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:17.480\nJust when they thought all hope was lost, a long lost ally reappeared.\n\n01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:18.480\nTylenol with Cody.\n\n01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:23.480\nWith the aid of the mystical unicorn, the party was able to destroy the beast's heart.\n\n01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:26.480\nThey defeated the great beast fell out in the sky, crashing to earth.\n\n01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:32.480\nWith a catastrophic crash, a catastrophic crash, and a sickening splat, you feel yourself being\n\n01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:36.480\nplugged into the wall and all the flesh in the chamber compulses, expanding and trapping\n\n01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:38.480\nyou within its great form.\n\n01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:43.480\nYou feel your bodies being squeezed, compressed, crushed, grabbed by feedback.\n\n01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.480\nAnd the squelch of liquefying tissues.\n\n01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:50.480\nIts side bursts open and your party is squirted out in a bolus of fleshy bits, slimy fluids,\n\n01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.480\nand bloody chunks.\n\n01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:56.480\nLand unceremoniously in a heap.\n\n01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:57.480\nSpencer!\n\n01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.480\nYep.\n\n01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:02.480\nYou were only three seconds over, but that was my fault.\n\n01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.480\nThat was my fault.\n\n01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:05.480\nYep.\n\n01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:08.480\nThat was some real dungeon mastering.\n\n01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.480\nSo are we on the ground?\n\n01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:15.480\nYou're on the ground in a big pile of each other, and you're swimming in fish fluids.\n\n01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:18.480\nThere's gross sand.\n\n01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.480\nOh, more rain.\n\n01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.480\nWow.\n\n01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.480\nYou have viscera in your hair.\n\n01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.480\nOh, it's embarrassing.\n\n01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:34.480\nHey, why don't you guys move in together and get a puppy?\n\n01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:40.480\nMaybe one day we will, little man, when we've finished our journeys and settled down.\n\n01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.480\nBut what are we really questing for?\n\n01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:43.480\nWe've been doing this for so long.\n\n01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.480\nWhat is it that we're really going after?\n\n01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:47.480\nWe got swallowed by the Infinifits.\n\n01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:48.480\nI know.\n\n01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:53.480\nAnd then that way, latest from the task of going to rescue my father, I think.\n\n01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.480\nYeah.\n\n01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:59.480\nSo can we still rescue your father, Sharpie?\n\n01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.480\nWe could.\n\n01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:06.480\nI mean, I've never liked him, but I've always wanted his approval.\n\n01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:12.480\nI feel like I got that, so we could let him die.\n\n01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.480\nYeah, you guys found closure there, I think?\n\n01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:19.480\nMy fathers are only good for approval after that, like what are they doing?\n\n01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:23.480\nTheir job is done when they come, right?\n\n01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.480\nIn the most technical terms.\n\n01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:31.480\nThey're not mothers, they don't nurse you.\n\n01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:37.480\nMy father taught me how to wear a breastplate and swing a sword.\n\n01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:41.480\nWell, maybe we should go hang out with him.\n\n01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:44.480\nYeah, I care about him, I guess.\n\n01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:48.480\nWell, why don't we explore our surroundings?\n\n01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:51.480\nYou explore your surroundings.\n\n01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:58.480\nI should say, after defeating the Great Infinifits, you feel wiser and stronger as a result.\n\n01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.480\nWhat?\n\n01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:01.480\nOh, shit.\n\n01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:02.480\nYou level up.\n\n01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:05.480\nLevel up!\n\n01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:13.480\n5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5...\n\n01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:18.480\nBut he's here, but he stayed and he's not going away!\n\n01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.480\nHe might soon.\n\n01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:23.480\nAnd now he called him out on his fill obligated, please feel obligated.\n\n01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:25.480\nSo are we level three now, Spencer?\n\n01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.480\nYou're level four at this point.\n\n01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.480\nPoor, holy smoke.\n\n01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.480\nThat is crazy.\n\n01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:29.480\nYeah, man.\n\n01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:30.480\nDon't we have an animal yet?\n\n01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:34.480\nAs it happens, at level four you gain an animal companion?\n\n01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:36.480\nYes, please.\n\n01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.480\nWhat kind of companion do you want?\n\n01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.480\nOh, I didn't know I had to choose.\n\n01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:47.480\nGod, I don't want to be Meg Ryan,\n\n01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.480\nbut what are my options?\n\n01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:51.480\nYou mean just a couple seconds here.\n\n01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:53.480\nWhen Harry met Sally, it doesn't really work\n\n01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:55.480\nbecause she was just refining her order.\n\n01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.480\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.480\nShe's famous for option exploration.\n\n01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:01.480\nI don't have what she's having.\n\n01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.480\nShe's very particular.\n\n01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:05.480\nIs there a fox?\n\n01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.480\nI'm going to shoot off some animals.\n\n01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:09.480\nBadger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog,\n\n01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:12.480\neagle, hawk, horse, owl, pony, snake, wolf.\n\n01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.480\nI'm a woman, horse.\n\n01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:16.480\nOkay, horse?\n\n01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:19.480\nHorse, so I can ride the horse.\n\n01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:22.480\nA horse trots up to you out of nowhere.\n\n01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:24.480\nWhat color is it?\n\n01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.480\nWhat color do you want it to be?\n\n01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:28.480\nYour animal companion.\n\n01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.480\nReally, shit.\n\n01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:32.480\nIt's brown.\n\n01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:34.480\nThere you go.\n\n01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:37.480\nIt approaches you with a knowing look in its eye.\n\n01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.480\nIt seems to say...\n\n01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:41.480\nMy name is Coco.\n\n01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:43.480\nLet's companionate.\n\n01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:45.480\nAnd that too.\n\n01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.480\nShe can say it all.\n\n01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:50.480\nOh, hi, Coco.\n\n01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.480\nWe nuzzle.\n\n01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.480\nYou nuzzle.\n\n01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:56.480\nI'm so happy.\n\n01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.480\nYou can leave me here in this viscera.\n\n01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:00.480\nI'm done.\n\n01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:02.480\nThis guy is this world is tinged with purple\n\n01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:04.480\nand swaying orbs of orange light\n\n01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.480\nthat seem far off, bob and weave,\n\n01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.480\nslightly in the twilight expanse of the sky.\n\n01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.480\nLarge trees cover all you can see\n\n01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:12.480\naside from the massive bulk of the affina fish\n\n01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:15.480\nwhose body is decimated a wide swath of trees\n\n01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.480\nthat it must have fell upon.\n\n01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.480\nThe body of the fish stretches upwards\n\n01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:21.480\nabout 20 feet higher than even the tallest of the trees.\n\n01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.480\nThe split in its side is massive\n\n01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.480\nand seems to be a mortal wound.\n\n01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:27.480\nThe body is iridescent and
