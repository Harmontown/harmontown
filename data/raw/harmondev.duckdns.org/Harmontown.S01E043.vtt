WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.480
Hello, everybody, thank you for waiting.

00:26.480 --> 00:44.720
Let's get up Steve Agy.

00:44.720 --> 00:55.480
Oh my God, it's so nice to be back in our beautiful Los Angeles, California at the glorious

00:55.480 --> 01:00.000
Egyptian Theater, Temple of the Pharaohs.

01:00.000 --> 01:10.360
I've got very good news for you all, guess what, Harmontown is now in session.

01:10.360 --> 01:15.760
Somewhere among you, Rome is a new Pharaoh, won't you please welcome to the stage the

01:15.760 --> 01:34.440
mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon, Egyptian pyramid like King Tut, I fucked your mama and

01:34.440 --> 01:39.040
her pussy and her butt, I fucked your daddy too, and I nuzzled his nuts, I fucked him all

01:39.040 --> 01:44.720
the way across the country on a big bus, I fucked your mama, I fucked your daddy too,

01:44.720 --> 01:50.240
I fucked your horse and I turned it to glue, freestyle, rap off the top of my head, I can

01:50.240 --> 01:57.440
do it acapella or to the beat instead, I fucked your mama, I fucked your mama, I fucked

01:57.440 --> 02:02.960
your mama like a bitch, it was a llama, it spit at me, and I spit at her back, I turned

02:02.960 --> 02:07.360
her around and I came in a crack, I fucked your mama on her head, I fucked your mama

02:07.360 --> 02:12.760
in her face, I fucked your mama to the moon, in outer space, I fucked your mama in a freestyle,

02:12.760 --> 02:17.600
rap so bad, I fucked your mama all across this great ass land, I fucked your mama on

02:17.600 --> 02:26.280
tour and I came home, fucked your mama with a buffalo row, stole that rhyme from a different

02:26.280 --> 02:28.280
song.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.280
Welcome back everybody.

02:29.280 --> 02:33.280
It's good to be back here in California.

02:33.280 --> 02:47.160
It would have been nice to get some asses in these seats, but it's good that some of

02:47.160 --> 02:48.160
you could have turned out.

02:48.160 --> 02:56.560
We have about 500 Angelinos in the audience, they all paid top dollar, ten dollars at least.

02:56.560 --> 03:00.160
Some people, Jeff, paid more than that, some people paid for some VIP treatment.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.920
Yeah, there was some kickstarter nonsense going on, but I've never quite understood

03:03.920 --> 03:07.080
how you do a kickstarter to make people come to a show.

03:07.080 --> 03:15.360
Not nonsense, Jeff, Harmon sense.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.800
I mean, there's 500 people here at least, but Dan has already gone to make a cocktail,

03:18.800 --> 03:19.800
which is fantastic.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.240
Well, because I had to leave mine back there because I'm strapped with all of this equipment,

03:23.240 --> 03:27.440
the director of the documentary has put me to work, there's a GoPro camera on my head

03:27.440 --> 03:33.640
shooting everybody, that'll get some beautiful images of not you waving just that light

03:33.640 --> 03:34.640
right there.

03:34.640 --> 03:43.040
There's a camera on your chest looking up at the camera on your head, but normally you

03:43.040 --> 03:51.080
spend so much time, Dan, I mean, I couldn't do this at home in the bathroom or anything.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.240
You spend so much time looking at your feet anyway, there's gonna be a camera shooting

03:54.240 --> 03:59.520
camera, it's gonna be like a Bruce Lee Hall of Mirrors going on.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.520
It's meta, dude.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.040
Don't want to make you a drink while you address the crowd.

04:02.040 --> 04:07.640
Yeah, could you please just, Christ, man, I'm a fucking showman, I've got shit to do.

04:07.640 --> 04:13.080
We got so much VIP treatment to knock out, but it's good to see so many old friends,

04:13.080 --> 04:14.080
too.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.080
I mean, we got to do this, we got to do a bullet train version of Harmontown, man.

04:18.080 --> 04:22.640
We got some special guests here tonight, we got a good friend that's fresh out of radiation,

04:22.640 --> 04:30.080
I want to talk to him about his balls, and we got an old hero that we made closer friends

04:30.080 --> 04:36.560
with on the road out there, and we have the Barbara Walters of Comedy, who's gonna give

04:36.560 --> 04:40.040
me some tips on interviewing, and I think he's got a pretty interesting story.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.760
But let's get these jingles out of the way.

04:44.760 --> 04:52.240
These are gonna be, so on the, these are gonna be a cappella anyway, it doesn't matter.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.120
Yeah, I don't know any of them.

04:54.120 --> 04:59.840
On the Kickstarter that we were selling tickets through, we offered, for $250 you could get

04:59.840 --> 05:02.680
a jingle written about your name.

05:02.680 --> 05:10.160
So the first person to take us up on it was our friend David Butler, who's our accountant.

05:10.160 --> 05:13.160
Who as far as we know paid for these tickets with our money.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.160
Right.

05:14.160 --> 05:19.960
So he bought the option, so, so here's David Butler's jingle.

05:19.960 --> 05:26.080
It's a comedy show.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.080
No, no, no, I'm sorry, laugh.

05:29.080 --> 05:33.560
Not my metronome, that.

05:33.560 --> 05:40.040
The Butler did it, David Butler did it, the Butler did it in the butt, but when David Butler

05:40.040 --> 05:45.720
did it, he regretted and he hit it, so he did it, but we don't know what, and when

05:45.720 --> 05:52.760
Butler does it, he gets away because it never leaves a single clue, so when you meet a Butler,

05:52.760 --> 05:56.960
keep your eyes on all your butts, or David Butler will be doing you.

05:56.960 --> 06:06.200
Investigators on the scene can never find, this Butler's nuts and wiener deep in your

06:06.200 --> 06:15.040
behind, and when there is no evidence, there is no crime.

06:15.040 --> 06:22.000
Oh, the Butler does it, but he does no time.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.640
The Butler did it, David Butler did it, he did it, but we don't know what.

06:27.640 --> 06:39.760
He didn't use a candlestick, his weapon is a giant dick, his victim is another butt.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.760
You can have your money back.

06:40.760 --> 06:47.160
You know what's going to be good, this shot on my shitty VHS camera, it looks like the

06:47.160 --> 06:51.280
Lawrence Walk Show out there, it looks really nice.

06:51.280 --> 06:57.040
These guys didn't really have their money back, Jim, Jim, what's his name, Spicoli?

06:57.040 --> 07:00.760
Is that you right there?

07:00.760 --> 07:01.760
Hello.

07:01.760 --> 07:08.200
Jim Scampoli, thank you for your $250, you can have it back, yes I know, you emailed

07:08.200 --> 07:12.040
and said, I know the thing is for a name, could you make it for the name of my comedy

07:12.040 --> 07:18.520
show, Jim and Them, hilarious for me to stand up here and sing Your Jingle for Your Show.

07:18.520 --> 07:26.480
But Turnabout's Fair Play, it's a shitty song, so I literally wrote it while like, you know.

07:26.480 --> 07:31.200
Dan had, in backstage had one hand had a Chick-fil-A sandwich in it, and the other hand was trying

07:31.200 --> 07:32.680
to write this song.

07:32.680 --> 07:37.240
Okay, so there's going to be a background track, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and

07:37.240 --> 07:44.200
Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them are everywhere, and when

07:44.200 --> 07:51.480
they die, no one will care, but they'll be buried side by side with hands clasped tight

07:51.480 --> 07:59.080
and heads held high, they're just some friends of a guy named Jim, they don't have much,

07:59.080 --> 08:07.080
but they've got him, oh Christmas tree, oh Jim and Them, let's drink some pee, Jim and

08:07.080 --> 08:10.320
Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and Them, Jim and

08:10.320 --> 08:16.560
Them paid for this song, it was supposed to be a name, so they did it wrong, but Jim

08:16.560 --> 08:25.400
and Them are where it's at, all dogs are boys, all girls are cats, that's all I got.

08:25.400 --> 08:53.920
You can have your money back, it's free, Jim, Sports Corner!

08:53.920 --> 09:00.400
So Dan, what a bull, no ordinary bull, Jeff, never is this time of year, how do you feel

09:00.400 --> 09:06.120
about the city that hosted the Super Bowl, how did they do as a city, well it's great

09:06.120 --> 09:10.200
when the team can be on their home turf, they always gain more confidence from that, so

09:10.200 --> 09:14.480
you thought the Saints had the home field advantage there, great to see them having

09:14.480 --> 09:23.200
the home field advantage, now you heard about the big gaff of the electricity, yeah, these

09:23.200 --> 09:27.040
things are going to happen, Jeff, there's a lot of electricity pouring into the stadiums

09:27.040 --> 09:32.200
when people play and so someone's going to always hit the wrong switch or something.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.040
So who did you have your money on going into that game?

09:35.040 --> 09:39.760
I was a bird's, what was the Ravens?

09:39.760 --> 09:42.120
Ravens, you got one right!

09:42.120 --> 09:50.840
Well I learned this in San Francisco, I was thinking Ravens maybe, then I thought maybe

09:50.840 --> 09:56.280
49ers and then, Jeff, it's all about yardage, so I just thought I would wait to see which

09:56.280 --> 10:00.560
team got more yardage and then base it on that, did you know, Jeff, that they were playing

10:00.560 --> 10:01.840
on artificial turf?

10:01.840 --> 10:07.440
I did know that, because it was an indoor dome, yeah, so the yardage is wider, you gain

10:07.440 --> 10:16.880
more yardage, sunlight shortens yards, yeah, great bull, great game, amazing the outcome,

10:16.880 --> 10:20.680
who could have predicted it, not me, certainly nobody, we don't need to repeat it, you don't

10:20.680 --> 10:24.000
need to quiz me on it, that's not what sports corners are about.

10:24.000 --> 10:31.280
Now it's time for an all tennis, Australian Open Talk!

10:31.280 --> 10:32.280
G'day!

10:32.280 --> 10:37.200
Wow, some Australian Open, huh Harmon?

10:37.200 --> 10:40.840
Wow, Wimbledon's got nothing on the Australians, Jeff.

10:40.840 --> 10:41.840
Why is that?

10:41.840 --> 10:48.320
Well, they've got courts that are larger, they've got, the nets are higher, people are

10:48.320 --> 10:54.200
out there, they want to win, you know, they swing the rackets, actually the umpire comes

10:54.200 --> 10:57.320
out at the beginning and puts a larger net out, and if he holds the original sized net

10:57.320 --> 11:02.320
and goes, that's not a net, then they bring out the Australian net and he goes, now that's

11:02.320 --> 11:03.320
a net.

11:03.320 --> 11:09.520
Yeah, he lets you know, sports corner sucks, let's kill it, I knew too much about the Super

11:09.520 --> 11:11.840
Bull because I actually went to the bar and I actually went to the bar and I actually

11:11.840 --> 11:12.840
went to the bar.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.600
That's why I went to Australian Open, you don't know shit about tennis.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.760
I know, but then I said the courts are longer, I don't know what sports, I don't know what

11:17.760 --> 11:22.040
the joke is anymore, I don't get it, I don't get my own joke anymore.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.640
You've got too many cameras on your head, I don't like sports, I don't know anything

11:24.640 --> 11:28.560
about sports, I've got a bunch of cameras in my head, let's just, let's free-form.

11:28.560 --> 11:32.520
If you could be good at any sport, honestly, if you could be good at one physical activity

11:32.520 --> 11:35.520
or sport, what would be the one thing you'd be awesome at?

11:35.520 --> 11:37.480
Does it come at the expense of anything else?

11:37.480 --> 11:39.160
No, no, you poof and you have it.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.240
Okay, just an extra thing I get to do.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.680
You can hit a baseball farther than anybody or you're the world's best golfer or you

11:44.680 --> 11:51.560
can scoop a dive deeper or I don't know, I almost want to say Billiards, but then it

11:51.560 --> 11:57.720
would just be one of those billiard dicks, because that's where it would come in handy.

11:57.720 --> 12:06.680
Some people call me Billiards dick, because I got a pocket for a ball, some people call

12:06.680 --> 12:14.640
me Billiards dick because I live inside a billiards hall, yeah, oh I got chops.

12:14.640 --> 12:22.280
I live inside a place where they play pool and I fuck your mama all the time.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.280
Rhyme.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.280
Okay.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.280
Squeeze a lime?

12:25.280 --> 12:26.280
What are you going to say there yet?

12:26.280 --> 12:27.280
No, no, no, I don't care.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.880
You've been rapping across this great nation of ours and you still haven't learned to stop

12:29.880 --> 12:32.360
saying south and mouth.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.360
Time and rhyme.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.360
Time and rhyme.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.360
Mama and llama.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.360
You know, I don't know.

12:36.360 --> 12:42.200
I don't know if any of you had listened to the podcast as we went across the country.

12:42.200 --> 12:47.040
I felt there was an opportunity there for Dan to really grow as a rapper and I think

12:47.040 --> 12:49.480
now is the time to test whether or not you have.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.480
I got good at rapping.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.480
You can hear me running around Madison.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.480
You can hear me starting to get really good.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.480
Yo, yo, yo, freestyle, freestyle.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.480
On the top of my head, don't know what to say.

12:55.480 --> 12:56.480
Punch a comment in the grass at the hay.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.480
Took a picture board instead of my dick.

12:57.480 --> 12:58.480
Stuck it inside her like a lunatic.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.480
She died.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.480
I went to prison.

13:00.480 --> 13:12.480
Newton, in the middle of the prison, split light to three colors.

13:12.480 --> 13:21.480
I punched a comment and then her brother, that's my uncle, no, it's yours.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.480
I punched her.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.480
They're all pores.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.480
I punched her butt, I punched her right.

13:24.480 --> 13:25.480
I punched them with toothpaste, made their teeth bright.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.480
I punched them.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.480
I punched them on their tongues.

13:27.480 --> 13:32.480
I punched them in their mouth and then I was done.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.480
I was done.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.480
I was done.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.480
I was done.

13:35.480 --> 13:36.480
Okay, I was wrong.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.480
Thanks, Los Angeles.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.480
West Coast.

13:38.480 --> 13:53.480
You fucked up a woman's brother and for a moment consider that was your own uncle.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.480
Yeah, well, but you fight as many mamas as I do.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.480
Chances are you're fucking one of your own uncles.

13:59.480 --> 14:02.480
Genealogy becomes a haze.

14:02.480 --> 14:06.480
Everyone's mama becomes like a silver Prius, you know.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.480
It's like the most common thing.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.480
You're just lost in the parking lot.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.480
All right, Herman, I missed you in the drive home.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.480
Holy shit.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.480
You all right?

14:14.480 --> 14:16.480
Yeah, well, there's blood coming back to me.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.480
Jesus Christ.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.480
In Denver, you blame the altitude, but we're not high right now.

14:21.480 --> 14:25.480
Yeah, I'm a little high.

14:25.480 --> 14:32.480
All right, Jeff, but I left you for a while then and I had to fly off to Vegas to do a

14:32.480 --> 14:34.480
thing and I missed the ride home.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.480
The triumphant return.

14:35.480 --> 14:36.480
Yeah.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.480
What did I miss?

14:37.480 --> 14:38.480
I don't know what you missed.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.480
You missed the sad goodbyes.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.480
You know, you missed.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.480
Did you see Splencers?

14:43.480 --> 14:44.480
Splencers.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.480
I saw when he added an L to his name.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.480
Yeah.

14:47.480 --> 14:55.480
Yeah, Spencer left his incredibly beautiful melancholy YouTubey kind of clip.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.480
Wait, was he driving during that?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.480
He kept talking about who's driving, but he was looking at the camera.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.480
I was worried about...

15:00.480 --> 15:01.480
He had to drive out and see me valley.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.480
He just gets in his car and just drives.

15:03.480 --> 15:06.480
And it was really, it was beautiful and it's sadness.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.480
He's going to steal the documentary.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.480
We know that.

15:09.480 --> 15:10.480
Yeah.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.480
It's going to be a documentary character that everyone's gay for.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.480
I like that guy.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.480
He's going to be on the cover of the DVD.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.480
He's beard.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.480
He's bigger than you on our poster, I think, isn't he?

15:22.480 --> 15:23.480
Like on the...

15:23.480 --> 15:24.480
Probably.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.480
His beard's bigger.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.480
Because I didn't learn anything, Jeff.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.480
I didn't change out there.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.480
You learned nothing from that?

15:31.480 --> 15:33.480
I got a little better at rapping.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.480
I learned a little bit.

15:35.480 --> 15:41.480
I learned that I'm an abusive boyfriend, but I think I already knew that.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.480
I learned that the fans are great.

15:44.480 --> 15:45.480
I learned they're good people.

15:45.480 --> 15:50.480
I learned that I can do whatever I want and that I don't know what to do with that permission.

15:50.480 --> 15:55.480
It's a bore people, make them sad, sometimes gross them out.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.480
I learned that I smell like an onion.

15:57.480 --> 16:04.480
I learned that my hemorrhoid comes back quicker if I'm off my diet.

16:04.480 --> 16:09.480
Your hemorrhoid came back in Salt Lake City, I believe.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.480
Dan was walking around backstage.

16:39.480 --> 16:50.480
I tried to keep it a secret, but it kept peeking out and I couldn't help but tell everyone.

16:50.480 --> 16:58.480
Because when you got a hemorrhoid, it itches and it bleeds.

16:58.480 --> 17:04.480
And it doesn't matter what the audience needs.

17:04.480 --> 17:10.480
I just want to be truthful and tell her I got a fucking thing on my ass.

17:10.480 --> 17:14.480
Her word has been head of the class.

17:14.480 --> 17:21.480
Say it again, I'm saying her word has been head of the class.

17:21.480 --> 17:26.480
I got a hemorrhoid sticking out of my ass.

17:26.480 --> 17:34.480
Toby Keith gonna make some pita skins and grenades. I'm gonna do countries and invade.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.480
I'm gonna wave the flag and suck a million balls.

17:37.480 --> 17:42.480
Toby Keith gonna ride a tank and get you surprised.

17:42.480 --> 17:50.480
Oh it's me, Toby Keith, surprised. I sang a song for you and I'm jerking off in the mirror every night.

17:50.480 --> 18:01.480
I fuck my mother and I cry when I masturbate. Toby Keith, I'm a big dumb fucking asshole, Toby Keith.

18:01.480 --> 18:07.480
Easy target. Easy target.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.480
Yeah, we came down pretty hard on Toby Keith.

18:10.480 --> 18:16.480
He barely survived the Dixie Chick. He's an easy target.

18:16.480 --> 18:22.480
I almost lost a fight to a Dixie Chick. Okay, let's start bringing some of our people up here.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.480
We got people.

18:24.480 --> 18:28.480
We got a roster of A-list people to talk to. I'm trying to think of what order to do them.

18:28.480 --> 18:34.480
I think that the most logical order will be to check in with...

18:34.480 --> 18:37.480
I'm sorry, I'm out of breath.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.480
You're off your diet, man.

18:39.480 --> 18:45.480
I went off my diet and I'm out of breath by fake line dancing.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.480
How much weight do you think you gained on the road?

18:47.480 --> 18:49.480
Probably like 15, 20 pounds.

18:49.480 --> 18:53.480
There was a point where we went to In-N-Out and you weren't there.

18:53.480 --> 18:57.480
From San Francisco to LA, I was like, okay, I got to go back to the diet when I got to LA.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.480
That's when the shit really hit the fan.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.480
That's when the shame eating started.

19:03.480 --> 19:07.480
Not hungry at all, ever. Hungry, just eating, just to eat.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.480
Just because we went to LA, I was going to go back to the diet.

19:10.480 --> 19:15.480
I went to In-N-Out, got a double double with some fries, a Neapolitan shake.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.480
It's a secret thing Spencer taught me about.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.480
There's all kinds of stuff off the menu. You can get like a flying handjob.

19:22.480 --> 19:28.480
You can get a reverse chihuahua.

19:28.480 --> 19:35.480
You can get David Blaine's scrotum.

19:35.480 --> 19:40.480
K-Pickles and no onions, but three patties, but they're not on a bun.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.480
They're on three sheets of paper and there's a cigarette on top.

19:43.480 --> 19:47.480
And they're suspended 40 miles above the earth.

19:47.480 --> 19:55.480
Yeah, and then a bus drives by and it's got your dead friend's name on it.

19:55.480 --> 19:58.480
It's only $4.95. It's really a deal.

19:58.480 --> 20:01.480
It's pretty great, but it never goes away.

20:01.480 --> 20:08.480
And it's slowly just sadder and sadder.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.480
So I got the double double.

20:11.480 --> 20:15.480
The fries were stale. They were too crispy.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.480
Okay, you follow me?

20:17.480 --> 20:19.480
I got you.

20:19.480 --> 20:24.480
I went to an adjacent McDonald's and here's where it gets shady.

20:24.480 --> 20:32.480
The bus had overheated and everyone was watching our bus driver Jason fix the engine on the bus.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.480
I went to a McDonald's.

20:34.480 --> 20:38.480
I was like, these fries are stale. I'm going to get some better fries at McDonald's.

20:38.480 --> 20:41.480
I went to the McDonald's.

20:41.480 --> 20:49.480
And they found one of your earlier French fries stuck in there just to buy you time to sabotage the engine to go to McDonald's.

20:49.480 --> 20:55.480
But I'm not going to only get fries. I got a quarter pounder with cheese.

20:55.480 --> 21:01.480
And I got another milkshake.

21:01.480 --> 21:05.480
And I put it all in the bag.

21:05.480 --> 21:10.480
I put the milkshake in a bag so I would just look like I had fries.

21:10.480 --> 21:15.480
And I just walked past everybody who was on a picnic watching the bus get fixed.

21:15.480 --> 21:22.480
Top of the morning. I want to finish off these fries and go take a nap.

21:22.480 --> 21:26.480
And I just went into a bus and hid while I ate.

21:26.480 --> 21:32.480
16-year-old with real problems.

21:32.480 --> 21:36.480
But I'm 40 and the real problem is that shit will kill you, man. What am I doing?

21:36.480 --> 21:39.480
Alright, let's talk about speaking of...

21:39.480 --> 21:41.480
Our next guest.

21:41.480 --> 21:44.480
Our next guest is no stranger to...

21:44.480 --> 21:51.480
Diabetes.

21:51.480 --> 21:54.480
Our next guest we kept running into on the road out there.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.480
And he's an old hero of mine in terms of performance.

21:57.480 --> 22:05.480
I don't want that on him because I don't have an act and I'm not doing anything that he would want attributed to him.

22:05.480 --> 22:10.480
But when we were in Milwaukee we saw him do something incredibly inspiring.

22:10.480 --> 22:16.480
Me and Schrab and he put us past the tipping point of moving to LA.

22:16.480 --> 22:28.480
He was a master stand-up at one point and then at another point completely reinvented as a guy that would make some great indie films.

22:28.480 --> 22:34.480
So please welcome our friend, our road dog, our strange soulmate, Bob Goldthwaite.

22:34.480 --> 22:41.480
I think...

22:41.480 --> 22:43.480
I'll just let you have this.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.480
Yeah, okay, there you go.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.480
Hello. Check what?

22:47.480 --> 22:48.480
Hey, hi, thank you.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.480
Hey, how are you?

22:50.480 --> 22:51.480
I'm good, I'm good.

22:51.480 --> 22:55.480
I'd love to take credit for your comedy stylings.

22:55.480 --> 23:02.480
Well, you have a reputation like there's stories about you doing some insane shit on stage.

23:02.480 --> 23:10.480
What was the story about, please forgive me for not getting the details right, I'm going to sound like your dad or something.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.480
He lit Crispin Glover on fire one time.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.480
Correct, yes.

23:15.480 --> 23:20.480
There was another thing, were you opening for Pearl Jam or what?

23:20.480 --> 23:22.480
No, I opened up for Nirvana.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.480
Nirvana, okay, close enough.

23:24.480 --> 23:28.480
First of all, hello everybody.

23:28.480 --> 23:34.480
You know, I was sitting here waiting to go on and I started looking up and I was like, I like the theater.

23:34.480 --> 23:42.480
It's like, it was like this beautiful theater and they said, no, we can put some new shit right over that beautiful old architecture and take care of that.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.480
This is LA.

23:44.480 --> 23:50.480
So I opened for Nirvana, yeah, yeah, which people are always surprised.

23:50.480 --> 23:54.480
I met Nirvana before they broke.

23:54.480 --> 24:02.480
Kurt was a fan of mine and he interviewed me on an Ann Arbor, yeah, on a college radio station.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.480
He wanted to meet me.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.480
It's really weird and quiet, it's like finding out that.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.480
That's fine here though, that's fine.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.480
No, it's just fascinating.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.480
No, it's like fine here.

24:12.480 --> 24:16.480
Did you say Kurt Cobain interviewed you on an Ann Arbor, Michigan radio station?

24:16.480 --> 24:18.480
There's a college station, yeah.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.480
Wow.

24:20.480 --> 24:24.480
So he was moonlighting as a college radio DJ during Nirvana?

24:24.480 --> 24:28.480
No, but it was funny because he wanted to meet me, so that's how it was put together.

24:28.480 --> 24:32.480
But it's funny because he was quiet and kind of mumbly and then, you know, I'm going like...

24:32.480 --> 24:38.480
And so it was really an audible interview, you know.

24:38.480 --> 24:44.480
But people, when they find that out, it's like finding out that Jimmy Hendrix really liked Buddy Hackett, you know.

24:44.480 --> 24:48.480
They really can't wrap their brains around it.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.480
15 cities opening for Nirvana, but it was...

24:50.480 --> 24:52.480
Wow.

24:52.480 --> 24:58.480
A lot of comics I was like, oh, you know, worried about bombing, but that never really bothered me.

24:58.480 --> 25:02.480
You're being set up to bomb if you're a comic opening for a band.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.480
No one's there.

25:04.480 --> 25:08.480
But I also kind of enjoyed that part of it, you know what I mean?

25:08.480 --> 25:10.480
How did you do overall?

25:10.480 --> 25:12.480
Was it usually...

25:12.480 --> 25:16.480
You can't even hear him laughing, right?

25:16.480 --> 25:20.480
It was about every third show ago, okay.

25:20.480 --> 25:28.480
The first show I did was in Chicago right after Michael Jordan had retired from basketball.

25:28.480 --> 25:36.480
And myself and the Nirvanas knew as much about sports as you do, although I didn't even watch the football show yesterday.

25:36.480 --> 25:42.480
I didn't really watch it, but I saw the names of the teams and then someone brought shots over.

25:42.480 --> 25:48.480
Another guy that's in my cell phone came over and that's always bad news and I woke up 5 p.m. the next day.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.480
I'm sorry to interrupt you, please.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.480
No, no, no.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.480
Look, if you're bored with me, I know how these stories end.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.480
No, no.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.480
I'm not bored with you.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.480
This is the story I want to hear, the one that you're cheering up.

26:00.480 --> 26:08.480
Oh, so it was in Chicago and it was like 4,000 Nirvana fans and Michael Jordan had retired from basketball.

26:08.480 --> 26:14.480
And I went out and I wouldn't do this now because I actually understand that everybody has feelings now.

26:14.480 --> 26:19.480
But I went out and I said, hey, Chicago, how are you?

26:19.480 --> 26:25.480
I feel bad for Michael Jordan, but for $40 million a year, I'd shoot my own dad in the fucking head.

26:25.480 --> 26:31.480
And there was this noise that wasn't even that grown.

26:31.480 --> 26:38.480
In my mind, when I retell a story, the pits stop moving.

26:38.480 --> 26:43.480
I actually got hit with a teenager once when I was doing the show.

26:43.480 --> 26:46.480
When you do something like that, you're not sitting backstage.

26:46.480 --> 26:49.480
Maybe there's a 5 minute period backstage.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.480
Do you see that shit flying off of my walrus beard?

26:52.480 --> 27:00.480
For you and the podcast audience, there's shit flying off of my beard and mustache and I haven't trimmed for 30 days.

27:00.480 --> 27:04.480
You're in the wings and maybe in your head you're going like, I think I'll do this.

27:04.480 --> 27:08.480
But are you also thinking about their reaction or are you thinking like...

27:08.480 --> 27:11.480
If I know the truth, I never told this part of that story.

27:11.480 --> 27:16.480
I actually said that to Kurt as I was walking in the stage.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.480
I said $40 million, I'd shoot my own dad in the fucking head.

27:18.480 --> 27:24.480
And then I went out there and I said it and afterwards he goes, I can't believe you said that.

27:24.480 --> 27:31.480
When you said it to him, did he go like, you got to do that on stage?

27:31.480 --> 27:32.480
No, no, no.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.480
Kurt Cobain impression that I'm working on?

27:34.480 --> 27:35.480
I don't know.

27:35.480 --> 27:40.480
You got to do that on the stage, Bob Goldway.

27:40.480 --> 27:44.480
If Kurt Cobain was a horny bear, that's what that sounded like.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.480
Where's Bob Cobain on stage?

27:47.480 --> 27:50.480
A horny rubby's on my dick.

27:50.480 --> 27:57.480
Actually, I remember when I got off, he was truly like the only one laughing in the venue.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.480
He was behind an amp.

27:59.480 --> 28:06.480
Have you ever gone on stage and told the Kurt Cobain blowing his head off you?

28:06.480 --> 28:07.480
Myself?

28:07.480 --> 28:08.480
Yeah.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.480
Oh, no.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.480
I'm kidding, of course.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.480
Oh, you mean...

28:11.480 --> 28:17.480
That story comes full circle in a terrible way, is what I'm saying.

28:17.480 --> 28:26.480
Yeah, I feel like a bus you go by right now with his name on it to really bum me out all the way, Jeff.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.480
Hey, look at me from this angle.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.480
Look at me from this angle.

28:28.480 --> 28:32.480
Just from that angle.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.480
Just that specific angle.

28:33.480 --> 28:38.480
I think his most amazing power was that the amount of women he banged.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.480
Oh, man.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.480
That's the real David Blaine magic.

28:41.480 --> 28:48.480
So, why are you out there on the road? Why did I run into you in my underwear after yelling at my girlfriend at a hotel?

28:48.480 --> 28:49.480
Yeah.

28:49.480 --> 28:51.480
That was a nice icebreaker.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.480
I don't know why.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.480
Well, you guys were fighting in the room.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.480
Could you hear us?

28:56.480 --> 28:57.480
Oh, yeah.

28:57.480 --> 28:58.480
You could hear me?

28:58.480 --> 28:59.480
Yeah.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.480
You said you couldn't that night.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.480
I heard you when I walked in.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.480
When I came down the hall, I heard you fighting.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.480
Oh, fuck me.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.480
I mean, the documentary crew...

29:07.480 --> 29:08.480
I gaged it.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.480
I was like, is this 911?

29:10.480 --> 29:11.480
No, this is just fucking...

29:11.480 --> 29:12.480
No, this is just...

29:12.480 --> 29:13.480
They're just rehashing shit.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.480
Yeah.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.480
Yeah.

29:15.480 --> 29:16.480
Co-dependent.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.480
Because the people next to us was more...

29:17.480 --> 29:18.480
They were more of a dick in the ass.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.480
That woman that came out and yelled at us.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.480
She had to go autistic kids or something, yeah.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.480
It sounded like she was skinning an autistic kid.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.480
It was just like...

29:25.480 --> 29:28.480
I was like...

29:28.480 --> 29:30.480
I just put my babies to bed.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.480
I go, whatever you're calling it, lady.

29:32.480 --> 29:36.480
But remember, she yelled at us for being in the hall.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.480
Yeah, yeah.

29:37.480 --> 29:38.480
She did.

29:38.480 --> 29:39.480
That was the outrageous thing.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.480
I was yelling at my girlfriend.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.480
I was doing my Kevin Spacey.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.480
I call it my Kevin Spacey.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.480
I like the fact that...

29:45.480 --> 29:49.480
You, a family, an 80s comedian, Bobcat Goldway,

29:49.480 --> 29:51.480
and I'm the only one not screaming.

29:51.480 --> 29:56.480
Why am I the quiet one here?

29:56.480 --> 29:57.480
Yeah, why am I the one?

29:57.480 --> 30:01.480
Hey, man, we can all just, you know, keep it cool, all right?

30:01.480 --> 30:04.480
If my career has taught you anything, it's...

30:04.480 --> 30:08.480
That is hysterical.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.480
Well, I've never put that together.

30:10.480 --> 30:16.480
You used to be famous for screaming.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.480
That's a testament to how cool you've become in your recent career.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.480
That's another thing I wanted to ask you about.

30:22.480 --> 30:27.480
Your films, I feel like there must be something you do as a director.

30:27.480 --> 30:30.480
This is going to sound like I'm just kissing your ass because you're here.

30:30.480 --> 30:34.480
But I always wanted to ask you if there's something you do with your actors

30:34.480 --> 30:38.480
because I don't want to bag on Robin Williams.

30:38.480 --> 30:41.480
He's a comedian, icon, national treasure, blah, blah, blah.

30:41.480 --> 30:45.480
But I don't think he'd cry if he heard another person say,

30:45.480 --> 30:49.480
yeah, he's never really on my cup of tea on screen as a dramatic actor.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.480
But then your movie, where in that first actor,

30:52.480 --> 30:54.480
he's relating to that kid who eventually,

30:54.480 --> 30:57.480
automatically asphyxiates himself and like...

30:57.480 --> 30:58.480
Spoiler alert.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.480
Yeah, well, that's the first plot plan.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.480
Look, if you haven't seen it, who cares?

31:02.480 --> 31:03.480
The kid dies jerking off.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.480
Father of the Year.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.480
World's Greatest Dad.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.480
World's Greatest Goddamn Dad.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.480
This is the third time I've done that, too.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.480
But what is Father of the Year?

31:10.480 --> 31:11.480
Is that a...

31:11.480 --> 31:13.480
That must be some movie with...

31:13.480 --> 31:14.480
Billy Crystal or something.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.480
I think, yeah.

31:15.480 --> 31:16.480
Oh, Jesus.

31:16.480 --> 31:17.480
No, that's Father's Day.

31:17.480 --> 31:18.480
Father's Day?

31:18.480 --> 31:19.480
I don't fucking know.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.480
Well, let's make a movie called Father of the Year

31:21.480 --> 31:24.480
so that I stop being wrong about it when I ask you about it.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.480
Sequel?

31:25.480 --> 31:27.480
Hey, let me a flashback.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.480
Oh, remember before my kid died,

31:29.480 --> 31:34.480
it'd be like the Muppet Babies of auto-erotic fiction.

31:34.480 --> 31:38.480
I found Robin Williams absolutely resonant

31:38.480 --> 31:41.480
and relatable and compelling in that movie.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.480
Not only is it the first time I liked him

31:43.480 --> 31:45.480
in a long time as a dramatic actor,

31:45.480 --> 31:49.480
but it's the first time that I've ever seen a story

31:49.480 --> 31:51.480
about a dad of a teenage kid.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.480
I'm 40 years old now.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.480
I should have had a kid a long time ago.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.480
I'll probably have one at some point.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.480
You listening?

31:58.480 --> 32:01.480
Not if you keep yelling at her.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.480
No, are you kidding me?

32:03.480 --> 32:04.480
That makes her eggs drop.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.480
Yeah, I'm sure that is.

32:05.480 --> 32:06.480
I'm sure that is.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.480
We're like cats.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.480
It's like the barbed penis.

32:08.480 --> 32:11.480
Again, I wasn't nervous for either of your safety

32:11.480 --> 32:12.480
when I heard the fighting shit.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.480
It's just a weight-trash mating dance.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.480
It was like so played out your argument.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.480
At one point, I heard you go, line.

32:18.480 --> 32:24.480
Just your off-book and your confusing meeting.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.480
It's a dive out of a curtain.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.480
Yeah, that's all right.

32:26.480 --> 32:29.480
I did you a favor the day I met you.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.480
Oh, I did you a favor the day I met you.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.480
Now you want more?

32:35.480 --> 32:42.480
But I will strangle you with this plastic thing

32:42.480 --> 32:44.480
that holds six packs together.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.480
You're a fish to me.

32:46.480 --> 32:50.480
So if we were...

32:50.480 --> 32:54.480
If you were in a movie with me right now,

32:54.480 --> 32:56.480
Dan, that was really good.

32:56.480 --> 32:57.480
Let's just do it again.

32:57.480 --> 33:00.480
And we have mics.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.480
Everybody can hear you.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.480
That is often the note I get from...

33:06.480 --> 33:07.480
Well, from me, you know?

33:07.480 --> 33:09.480
I mean, I always thought I had to make

33:09.480 --> 33:11.480
the craft service people laugh, you know?

33:11.480 --> 33:15.480
So I was like, I do still say that I'm a really bad actor.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.480
And I think maybe part of that,

33:17.480 --> 33:19.480
if people do like the movies I make,

33:19.480 --> 33:20.480
you know, you can ask Marin.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.480
I just worked with him.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.480
I don't know if I did anything for him.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.480
I'm not going to ask Marin anything.

33:25.480 --> 33:29.480
He's going to go...

33:29.480 --> 33:32.480
But, you know, Robin and I have been friends.

33:32.480 --> 33:33.480
Marc Maron, everybody.

33:33.480 --> 33:34.480
There we go.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.480
Marc Maron to the stage.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.480
Just come on up, Mason.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.480
Yeah, let's get him up here.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.480
Marc Maron.

33:42.480 --> 33:45.480
Yo, yo, it's Marc Maron.

33:45.480 --> 33:48.480
Yo, Marc Maron, why you staring?

33:48.480 --> 33:50.480
Is your mama rocking chairing?

33:50.480 --> 33:52.480
Gonna fuck her like Sherrod Stone.

33:52.480 --> 33:56.480
I gave your mama my bone to Marc Maron.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.480
Mrs. Marin got alone,

33:58.480 --> 34:01.480
but not for long when I came to her house.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.480
I put my waddle weenie in her like a shit was a mouse.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.480
It went peep peep peep and could I get some cheese?

34:07.480 --> 34:09.480
My name is Marisa Marin.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.480
Could I have some more, please?

34:11.480 --> 34:14.480
Harmon's dick is going to make you pregnant.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.480
Nothing's going to rhyme with that.

34:16.480 --> 34:19.480
That's the end.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.480
Hello, Mark.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.480
Hey.

34:21.480 --> 34:22.480
Is this Vine?

34:22.480 --> 34:24.480
Are you vining me?

34:24.480 --> 34:27.480
I got to tell my mom to listen to this.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.480
I didn't know it was mine.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.480
Those ones are going to tell my mother to listen to you.

34:31.480 --> 34:32.480
That's very nice.

34:32.480 --> 34:38.480
I thought vining was actually putting your penis in the foreground of a photo.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.480
That's like a...

34:40.480 --> 34:44.480
So, there's a lot of motherfucking going on in your rap.

34:44.480 --> 34:49.480
I am not soft on mamas when I rap.

34:49.480 --> 34:52.480
I don't get to use the n-word, so I just fill...

34:52.480 --> 34:55.480
My styrofoam peanut is fuck your mama.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.480
So, that's your analogy for the n-word?

34:57.480 --> 34:58.480
Is your mother?

34:58.480 --> 34:59.480
No, I'm just saying.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.480
If I could use the n-word, my rap should be filled with it.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.480
That's why he's the master, ladies and gentlemen.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.480
Bam.

35:04.480 --> 35:05.480
Right?

35:05.480 --> 35:07.480
Boiled it down.

35:07.480 --> 35:11.480
So, your mother's looking for the n-word.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.480
He's the Barbara Walters of comics.

35:13.480 --> 35:17.480
I'm not sure I like that so much.

35:17.480 --> 35:19.480
I saw that written about you, and I thought that was...

35:19.480 --> 35:21.480
I immediately knew that you wouldn't have like that.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.480
So, that was amazing.

35:23.480 --> 35:27.480
I'm an annoying Jewish woman of podcasting?

35:27.480 --> 35:29.480
All right, I'll take it.

35:29.480 --> 35:34.480
I've always saw him as the Daelus Reigns of...

35:34.480 --> 35:37.480
I'm glad I'm not the only person who didn't get that reference.

35:37.480 --> 35:40.480
Famous Orange Weatherman from California.

35:40.480 --> 35:41.480
Okay, okay.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.480
Good job on getting the mic.

35:43.480 --> 35:46.480
That only took a few minutes.

35:46.480 --> 35:50.480
I leaned over, and I went like...

35:50.480 --> 35:51.480
I gave a couple of hands.

35:51.480 --> 35:52.480
No, it feels better now.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.480
I appreciate it.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.480
For a while, that was wow.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.480
You want to know about Bob's directing style?

35:56.480 --> 35:57.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.480
He directed four episodes of my show.

35:59.480 --> 36:03.480
Which I saw the pilot for, which I'm really looking...

36:03.480 --> 36:04.480
Yeah, we talked about it.

36:04.480 --> 36:05.480
It was great.

36:05.480 --> 36:06.480
What Bob will do is he'll let you run the scene,

36:06.480 --> 36:09.480
and everybody will do the lines and everything.

36:09.480 --> 36:12.480
And then what he would do with me is he'd come over,

36:12.480 --> 36:14.480
and he'd sort of pull me aside, and he goes,

36:14.480 --> 36:16.480
don't listen to what anyone else is saying.

36:16.480 --> 36:19.480
Okay, just do what you want to do,

36:19.480 --> 36:21.480
and I'm going to be over there.

36:21.480 --> 36:25.480
You hear a car start.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.480
Is that right?

36:26.480 --> 36:27.480
That's fair, yeah.

36:27.480 --> 36:28.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.480
I spend most of my time when I'm directing

36:30.480 --> 36:32.480
trying to find a chair.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.480
Yeah.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.480
Talked to me by the great Richard Donner.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.480
Actually, I was in Scrooge that he directed

36:39.480 --> 36:40.480
and a Tales from the Crypt.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.480
He's like, kid, you want to learn how to direct?

36:42.480 --> 36:44.480
I go, yeah.

36:44.480 --> 36:45.480
And he goes, come on my trailer.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.480
Uh-oh.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.480
Yeah.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.480
I'm not falling for that again.

36:49.480 --> 36:50.480
No.

36:50.480 --> 36:54.480
And so he says, he just throws me a pillow,

36:54.480 --> 36:56.480
and he goes, take a lot of naps.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.480
It's a true story.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.480
I go, really?

37:00.480 --> 37:02.480
And that's why he got fired off of Superman, too.

37:02.480 --> 37:03.480
Yeah.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.480
That's what I was told writers, like young writers,

37:05.480 --> 37:07.480
you have any advice for young writers?

37:07.480 --> 37:08.480
Go take a nap.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.480
You're young.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.480
Don't wake up until the pressure's on.

37:11.480 --> 37:14.480
You sit at the computer, and you look at the screen

37:14.480 --> 37:16.480
until you go, fuck.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.480
And then you jerk off.

37:17.480 --> 37:18.480
Yeah.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.480
And then you take a nap.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.480
Isn't that writing?

37:21.480 --> 37:23.480
I mean, am I misunderstanding it?

37:23.480 --> 37:26.480
Get as short a deadline as you possibly can

37:26.480 --> 37:28.480
from anyone that's willing to pay you for anything,

37:28.480 --> 37:30.480
because if they give you nine months,

37:30.480 --> 37:33.480
you will find out what happens to your body

37:33.480 --> 37:37.480
if you masturbate for eight months in three weeks.

37:37.480 --> 37:40.480
You will see a penis.

37:40.480 --> 37:45.480
I passed that line 20 years ago.

37:45.480 --> 37:51.480
All this is explained to you in the WGA Guild books.

37:51.480 --> 37:55.480
Just a bunch of photos of writer's dicks.

37:55.480 --> 37:59.480
A bunch of photos of writer's dicks.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.480
Do you want me to...

38:00.480 --> 38:02.480
A mac and cheese on the stove.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.480
I'm sorry.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.480
No, I don't want to step on anything,

38:05.480 --> 38:08.480
but I talked to you before the show,

38:08.480 --> 38:10.480
and I've got this story

38:10.480 --> 38:12.480
that is such a classic show business story

38:12.480 --> 38:14.480
that I've been gifted with.

38:14.480 --> 38:17.480
I never expected this to happen in my life,

38:17.480 --> 38:21.480
and I've got like a classic show business story.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.480
I think this is the place to do it,

38:23.480 --> 38:24.480
if anyone here wants to hear...

38:24.480 --> 38:27.480
A classic...

38:27.480 --> 38:30.480
Because it also addresses your question about interviewing,

38:30.480 --> 38:33.480
because it all comes around to this.

38:33.480 --> 38:34.480
By the way, this is what I want.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.480
I brought Marc Maron here because I wanted to...

38:37.480 --> 38:39.480
Well, trick people into buying tickets,

38:39.480 --> 38:41.480
but also I wanted to ask him,

38:41.480 --> 38:43.480
because I just finished his podcast tour,

38:43.480 --> 38:45.480
like, I'm a terrible interviewer.

38:45.480 --> 38:47.480
This is like my weakest skill, right, Jeff?

38:47.480 --> 38:48.480
After rap.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.480
Yeah.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.480
I think he's excellent at rap.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.480
He is, he's alright.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.480
Yeah.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.480
Interviewing is no easy task,

38:55.480 --> 38:57.480
going to fuck your mama so hard.

38:57.480 --> 38:58.480
Pussy needs a blast.

38:58.480 --> 38:59.480
Alright, alright.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.480
He was...

39:00.480 --> 39:01.480
What'd I do?

39:01.480 --> 39:03.480
What'd I do?

39:03.480 --> 39:05.480
Yeah, the thing was going to be,

39:05.480 --> 39:08.480
I was going to ask Marin how do you interview people,

39:08.480 --> 39:10.480
as the Barbara Walters of comedians.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.480
Well, I don't know about that,

39:11.480 --> 39:12.480
but here's what happens.

39:12.480 --> 39:16.480
So, I get an opportunity to interview Mel Brooks.

39:16.480 --> 39:17.480
Okay?

39:17.480 --> 39:19.480
Now, right, it went up today,

39:19.480 --> 39:20.480
and if you listen to it,

39:20.480 --> 39:21.480
you heard half of this story,

39:21.480 --> 39:22.480
you haven't heard the whole story.

39:22.480 --> 39:23.480
So now, Mel Brooks,

39:23.480 --> 39:26.480
there's nothing he hasn't said publicly about his life,

39:26.480 --> 39:27.480
that he has worked into a shtick,

39:27.480 --> 39:29.480
and that he's gotten laughs with.

39:29.480 --> 39:30.480
It's all out there.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.480
I did research,

39:31.480 --> 39:33.480
I watched all the old dick-cava shows,

39:33.480 --> 39:34.480
I watched the new dick-cava interview,

39:34.480 --> 39:37.480
I watched him interviewed by some English guy.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.480
I listened to a whole episode of The Nerdist.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.480
Alright, that's how far I went.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.480
Wow!

39:42.480 --> 39:44.480
And I say that with love,

39:44.480 --> 39:47.480
and so I put a resentment and contempt.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.480
That's the triangle for me,

39:49.480 --> 39:52.480
that's the triad.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.480
So, my problem was,

39:54.480 --> 39:56.480
how am I going to talk to Mel Brooks

39:56.480 --> 39:57.480
and get something out of him

39:57.480 --> 39:59.480
that he hasn't said before,

39:59.480 --> 40:01.480
and really connect with him as a person?

40:01.480 --> 40:03.480
So, I realized going in,

40:03.480 --> 40:04.480
this would be the advice,

40:04.480 --> 40:05.480
I don't know if you can take this advice,

40:05.480 --> 40:06.480
my first thought was like,

40:06.480 --> 40:08.480
I'm a Jew.

40:08.480 --> 40:09.480
It's alright.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.480
I'm a Jew.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.480
Welcome to the Egyptian.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.480
He's a Jew.

40:13.480 --> 40:16.480
Yeah, we used to...

40:16.480 --> 40:17.480
Thank you.

40:17.480 --> 40:18.480
This place is beautiful.

40:18.480 --> 40:19.480
No, we did a lot of work for them.

40:19.480 --> 40:20.480
We did a lot of work for them.

40:20.480 --> 40:23.480
Some of the greatest Jewish artifacts are Egyptian.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.480
We're going to put you in a basket

40:24.480 --> 40:26.480
and a river after the show.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.480
That would be fine.

40:27.480 --> 40:30.480
I hope that his mother finds me.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.480
So I can fuck her.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.480
The...

40:34.480 --> 40:35.480
Boom.

40:35.480 --> 40:36.480
Huh?

40:36.480 --> 40:37.480
West side.

40:37.480 --> 40:38.480
Alright, so I figure I'll just go

40:38.480 --> 40:40.480
full Jew with Mel.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.480
That's why I just...

40:42.480 --> 40:43.480
Literally, I got in there

40:43.480 --> 40:44.480
within five minutes,

40:44.480 --> 40:45.480
I'm talking like this.

40:45.480 --> 40:46.480
What, are you kidding me?

40:46.480 --> 40:47.480
Of course, you know.

40:47.480 --> 40:48.480
New podcast,

40:48.480 --> 40:49.480
full Jew with Mel.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.480
Full Jew with Mel.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.480
But I've seen that happen to you

40:52.480 --> 40:54.480
when we had a kindler on the show.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.480
I haven't sort of...

40:56.480 --> 40:59.480
If you've got payas, do it like that.

40:59.480 --> 41:01.480
It's really weird.

41:01.480 --> 41:03.480
That was a good moment on the show.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.480
That was fucking hilarious.

41:05.480 --> 41:06.480
Judd Hirsch plays my dad.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.480
My dad's a bipolar lunatic, alright?

41:08.480 --> 41:10.480
So they get Judd Hirsch to play him.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.480
And my concern was Judd Hirsch is a little too...

41:12.480 --> 41:13.480
Hey, how are you? I'm cute.

41:13.480 --> 41:14.480
You know, so...

41:14.480 --> 41:15.480
You replaced what's his name with Judd Hirsch?

41:15.480 --> 41:16.480
Well, he couldn't do it.

41:16.480 --> 41:17.480
That's awesome.

41:17.480 --> 41:18.480
Judd Hirsch is...

41:18.480 --> 41:19.480
He's great.

41:19.480 --> 41:20.480
He's a great actor, right?

41:20.480 --> 41:21.480
But my fear was

41:21.480 --> 41:22.480
why he'd be too cute and too Jewish

41:22.480 --> 41:24.480
and not scary enough to be my father, right?

41:24.480 --> 41:26.480
So he gets there on the first day of shooting

41:26.480 --> 41:27.480
and he's doing his Judd Hirsching.

41:27.480 --> 41:28.480
Like, hey, I'm here.

41:28.480 --> 41:29.480
What do we do?

41:29.480 --> 41:31.480
And all you guys were sitting there

41:31.480 --> 41:33.480
behind the camera going,

41:33.480 --> 41:34.480
oh, he's doing it.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.480
Uh-oh.

41:35.480 --> 41:36.480
Oh, boy.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.480
Independence Day.

41:37.480 --> 41:38.480
Right.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.480
And then there was that moment where I'm like,

41:39.480 --> 41:40.480
he's an actor.

41:40.480 --> 41:41.480
Go tell him to be scary.

41:41.480 --> 41:42.480
And then you went over there

41:42.480 --> 41:43.480
and I think you said,

41:43.480 --> 41:46.480
Judd, can you turn down the Jew a little bit?

41:46.480 --> 41:48.480
Is that what you said?

41:48.480 --> 41:49.480
Yes.

41:49.480 --> 41:50.480
Can you...

41:50.480 --> 41:54.480
Could you just leaven it one quarter inch?

41:54.480 --> 41:55.480
Could you just...

41:55.480 --> 41:58.480
Could you just snip a little bit off the end of it?

41:58.480 --> 41:59.480
End of it?

41:59.480 --> 42:00.480
Or snip less, right?

42:00.480 --> 42:01.480
I don't know.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.480
That always confused me.

42:02.480 --> 42:04.480
No, because I always...

42:04.480 --> 42:07.480
What do I say about this?

42:07.480 --> 42:09.480
He was great, by the way.

42:09.480 --> 42:10.480
Oh, you know, my favorite part of that was

42:10.480 --> 42:12.480
we got done with that episode and you go,

42:12.480 --> 42:15.480
Mary goes, um...

42:15.480 --> 42:19.480
I think my real dad's gonna sue me.

42:19.480 --> 42:22.480
And I go, he should.

42:22.480 --> 42:24.480
That may happen.

42:24.480 --> 42:25.480
No, Brooks.

42:25.480 --> 42:27.480
I don't want to take up all your time.

42:27.480 --> 42:28.480
Yeah, tell the story.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.480
Full Jew.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.480
Full Jew.

42:30.480 --> 42:31.480
So I talk to Mel Brooks.

42:31.480 --> 42:32.480
I'm talking to him.

42:32.480 --> 42:33.480
We're getting along.

42:33.480 --> 42:34.480
We're hitting it off.

42:34.480 --> 42:35.480
There's a couple of great moments in the podcast.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.480
One that is now actually on the podcast.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.480
Mel Brooks looks at me and he goes,

42:37.480 --> 42:39.480
I'm gonna give you something exclusive.

42:39.480 --> 42:41.480
And I'm like, fucking great.

42:41.480 --> 42:43.480
He goes, I'm at the Fox Commissary.

42:43.480 --> 42:46.480
I see Gene Wilder sitting with a legal pad.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.480
And I walk up to him and I go,

42:47.480 --> 42:48.480
what are you writing, Gene?

42:48.480 --> 42:49.480
He goes, Young Frankenstein.

42:49.480 --> 42:50.480
It's an outline for a movie.

42:50.480 --> 42:51.480
And Mel Brooks says...

42:51.480 --> 42:52.480
He says, I said to Gene,

42:52.480 --> 42:54.480
I said, we're gonna do that movie.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.480
And Gene said, you gotta get me out here.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.480
Mel Brooks said, I'll get you out here.

42:58.480 --> 43:01.480
And Gene says, I want a cottage at that.

43:01.480 --> 43:05.480
And then Mel Brooks goes, what the hell is that hotel?

43:05.480 --> 43:06.480
What's that hotel?

43:06.480 --> 43:07.480
And I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about.

43:07.480 --> 43:09.480
You know that it's a hotel.

43:09.480 --> 43:10.480
It's in Bel Air.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.480
It's a hotel.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.480
And I go, Beverly Hills Hotel.

43:13.480 --> 43:16.480
He goes, no, it's in Bel Air.

43:16.480 --> 43:18.480
Hold on a minute.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.480
I'll get it.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.480
And then he stands up and he goes to the door

43:21.480 --> 43:22.480
where his assistant is.

43:22.480 --> 43:24.480
He goes, what is that hotel?

43:24.480 --> 43:26.480
It's in Bel Air.

43:26.480 --> 43:27.480
It's on that street.

43:27.480 --> 43:28.480
What is it called?

43:28.480 --> 43:30.480
And I hear the assistant go, I don't know.

43:30.480 --> 43:32.480
He's like, look it up on the thing.

43:32.480 --> 43:35.480
All right, so I hear her clicking away.

43:35.480 --> 43:38.480
And he goes, it's in Bel Air.

43:38.480 --> 43:40.480
And she goes, is it the Bel Air Hotel?

43:40.480 --> 43:41.480
That's it.

43:41.480 --> 43:42.480
The Bel Air Hotel.

43:42.480 --> 43:43.480
Wow.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.480
And he comes in, he sits down.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.480
He wants a room at the Bel Air Hotel.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.480
He wants a supply of Earl Grey Tea

43:49.480 --> 43:52.480
and a supply of digestive biscuits.

43:52.480 --> 43:54.480
And I'm like, yeah.

43:54.480 --> 43:56.480
And he goes, that's the whole thing.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.480
All right.

43:58.480 --> 43:59.480
He's beautiful.

43:59.480 --> 44:01.480
He got that out of Mel Brooks.

44:01.480 --> 44:03.480
He's a master.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.480
So here's what happens.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.480
Here's what happens.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.480
So I do this whole interview of Mel.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.480
So he takes a liking to me and he says, you know,

44:11.480 --> 44:13.480
you should be doing a talk show on television.

44:13.480 --> 44:14.480
And I'm like, great.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.480
Make some calls.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.480
Let's make it happen.

44:16.480 --> 44:17.480
I want a cottage.

44:17.480 --> 44:18.480
Right.

44:18.480 --> 44:19.480
Yeah.

44:19.480 --> 44:20.480
At that hotel.

44:20.480 --> 44:22.480
I need Red Zinger.

44:22.480 --> 44:23.480
What's that?

44:23.480 --> 44:25.480
It's behind the bar.

44:25.480 --> 44:26.480
It's at the Marmont.

44:26.480 --> 44:27.480
It's a bungalow.

44:27.480 --> 44:28.480
What's it called?

44:28.480 --> 44:29.480
Yeah.

44:29.480 --> 44:31.480
So he then goes, you got to talk to Carl.

44:31.480 --> 44:32.480
He got to talk to Carl Reiner.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.480
And I'm like, that'd be great.

44:33.480 --> 44:35.480
He goes, I'll set up for you.

44:35.480 --> 44:36.480
I'll call Carl Reiner.

44:36.480 --> 44:37.480
It'll be great.

44:37.480 --> 44:38.480
And I go, how is Carl Reiner?

44:38.480 --> 44:41.480
And Mel goes, he's about 80%.

44:41.480 --> 44:43.480
All right.

44:43.480 --> 44:44.480
Hold on.

44:44.480 --> 44:45.480
Hold on.

44:45.480 --> 44:46.480
That's awesome.

44:46.480 --> 44:49.480
So then Mel goes, you know what?

44:49.480 --> 44:50.480
I'll walk you out.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.480
And I'm at Culver.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.980
I'm on the second floor in an office building at Culver Studios.

44:53.980 --> 44:54.980
So I walk outside.

44:54.980 --> 44:55.980
We walk down the hall.

44:55.980 --> 44:56.980
I go, thank you, Mel.

44:56.980 --> 44:58.480
And I got my boom in my bag and everything.

44:58.480 --> 44:59.480
He goes, you know what?

44:59.480 --> 45:00.480
I'll walk you down.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.480
So then we walk down.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.480
And I go, all right.

45:02.480 --> 45:03.480
Well, it was great, Mr. Books.

45:03.480 --> 45:04.480
He goes, I'm going to walk you outside.

45:04.480 --> 45:05.480
So we walk outside.

45:05.480 --> 45:06.480
And we're standing outside.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.480
I go, well, thank you again.

45:07.480 --> 45:10.480
He goes, where's your car?

45:10.480 --> 45:11.480
And I go, it's in the parking.

45:11.480 --> 45:13.480
I go, yeah, I'll walk you to your car.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.480
So I'm walking with Mel Brooks.

45:14.480 --> 45:15.480
It's a kid's fear.

45:15.480 --> 45:16.480
Right.

45:16.480 --> 45:19.480
Exactly.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.480
Ladies and gentlemen, Mel Brooks.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.480
It's hilarious.

45:21.480 --> 45:23.480
You would love him to be here.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.480
So then we walk to the parking.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.480
He goes, which car is it?

45:25.480 --> 45:27.480
And I go, it's a camera.

45:27.480 --> 45:28.480
He goes, and he points at a Bentley.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.480
He goes, oh, I thought this was it.

45:29.480 --> 45:32.480
Why did I walk you out here?

45:32.480 --> 45:34.480
And he goes, which camera?

45:34.480 --> 45:35.480
I go, it's that one.

45:35.480 --> 45:36.480
I walk over to the car.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.480
I'm like, thank you, Mel Brooks.

45:37.480 --> 45:38.480
And Mr. Brooks.

45:38.480 --> 45:45.480
And he goes, no, I'm going to watch you put your stuff in your car.

45:45.480 --> 45:48.480
So I put the stuff in the car and he goes, you should have a talk show.

45:48.480 --> 45:49.480
And I'm like, make those calls.

45:49.480 --> 45:50.480
He goes, you talk to Carl.

45:50.480 --> 45:51.480
Right.

45:51.480 --> 45:52.480
All right.

45:52.480 --> 45:54.480
So he sets up Carl.

45:54.480 --> 45:55.480
So I go to Carl's house.

45:55.480 --> 45:56.480
There's a whole other series.

45:56.480 --> 45:58.480
There's a whole other Jewish experience.

45:58.480 --> 46:00.480
I go to Carl's house.

46:00.480 --> 46:04.480
I'm greeted by his nephew and manager, George Shapiro, who's in his 70s.

46:04.480 --> 46:05.480
All right.

46:05.480 --> 46:08.480
Carl is going to be 91.

46:08.480 --> 46:09.480
So George should.

46:09.480 --> 46:10.480
Yeah, right.

46:10.480 --> 46:11.480
George Shapiro comes.

46:11.480 --> 46:12.480
He greets me.

46:12.480 --> 46:13.480
He talks about sign for five minutes.

46:13.480 --> 46:14.480
There's a publicist there.

46:14.480 --> 46:15.480
There's a chair, a couch.

46:15.480 --> 46:19.480
And then Carl comes down and he sits in a chair and I mic him up with the boom.

46:19.480 --> 46:20.480
Right.

46:20.480 --> 46:21.480
And we start talking.

46:21.480 --> 46:22.480
Right.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.480
And I say, so you and Mel hang out every night.

46:24.480 --> 46:26.480
I heard he says, he comes over here every night.

46:26.480 --> 46:27.480
We hang out.

46:27.480 --> 46:28.480
I'm like, what do you do?

46:28.480 --> 46:30.480
He goes, it has to do with chicken feathers.

46:30.480 --> 46:31.480
Maybe I'll tell you.

46:31.480 --> 46:32.480
Fine.

46:32.480 --> 46:36.480
So I'm sitting there talking to Carl for like an hour.

46:36.480 --> 46:40.480
While I'm talking to Carl, George Shapiro is in a chair directly across from us the entire

46:40.480 --> 46:43.480
time he's in and out of this.

46:43.480 --> 46:48.480
But when I finish the interview, Shapiro is the first one to get up and go, God, that

46:48.480 --> 46:49.480
was great.

46:49.480 --> 46:50.480
That was a great interview.

46:50.480 --> 46:51.480
All right.

46:51.480 --> 46:53.480
A couple of things happen real quick.

46:53.480 --> 46:56.480
Yeah, I'm getting to the punch line.

46:56.480 --> 46:57.480
You're doing fine.

46:57.480 --> 47:01.480
In the middle of the interview, he says, did you see that show on PBS about the Jews and

47:01.480 --> 47:02.480
the Broadway musicals?

47:02.480 --> 47:04.480
How many Jews were involved in Broadway musicals?

47:04.480 --> 47:05.480
I go ahead and see it.

47:05.480 --> 47:08.480
He goes, I never knew there were so many Jews involved in Broadway musicals.

47:08.480 --> 47:10.480
There's a whole list at the end.

47:10.480 --> 47:11.480
You got to see it.

47:11.480 --> 47:12.480
I'll show it to you after the interview.

47:12.480 --> 47:16.480
I'm like, fine.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.480
So we finish this fucking interview.

47:18.480 --> 47:21.480
I talked to him for like an hour and 15 minutes and then he starts, he says, I'm going to

47:21.480 --> 47:22.480
show you the thing.

47:22.480 --> 47:25.480
He starts playing with remote controls to find the thing on the Tivo, right?

47:25.480 --> 47:27.480
George Shapiro goes, is there ice cream?

47:27.480 --> 47:30.480
All right.

47:30.480 --> 47:35.480
Shapiro goes and he gets a box of ice cream sandwiches and he hands everyone an ice cream

47:35.480 --> 47:36.480
sandwich.

47:36.480 --> 47:39.480
So now, now we're eating ice cream sandwiches.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.480
Carl is figuring out the Tivo.

47:41.480 --> 47:43.480
I want to be Jewish.

47:43.480 --> 47:46.480
I want to be 90.

47:46.480 --> 47:51.480
So he finally figures the Tivo out and he starts the documentary at the beginning.

47:51.480 --> 47:54.480
So now I'm sitting there with an ice cream sandwich and I'm going to have to sit here

47:54.480 --> 47:56.480
for a fucking hour and watch the whole thing.

47:56.480 --> 47:59.480
I mean, it's familiar to me, but it's also a little peculiar, right?

47:59.480 --> 48:04.480
So we're watching that and I'm just sitting there and we're eating the ice cream.

48:04.480 --> 48:08.480
And yeah, I'm like, yeah, George Gershwin and we're talking and then the phone rings

48:08.480 --> 48:11.480
and I see Carl pick it up and I'm putting my shit away.

48:11.480 --> 48:12.480
And he goes, hello?

48:12.480 --> 48:13.480
Yes, it was great.

48:13.480 --> 48:14.480
It went very well.

48:14.480 --> 48:15.480
Yes.

48:15.480 --> 48:21.480
And he holds the phone out and he looks at me and he goes, it's Mel.

48:21.480 --> 48:23.480
So I pick up the phone.

48:23.480 --> 48:24.480
I go, hello?

48:24.480 --> 48:27.480
And all I hear is 80%, right?

48:27.480 --> 48:32.480
The butler did it.

48:32.480 --> 48:34.480
David Butler did it.

48:34.480 --> 48:36.480
He did it in the butt.

48:36.480 --> 48:40.480
And then I said to Carl, you know, I said, I said to Mel, I said, maybe 85.

48:40.480 --> 48:43.480
And he goes, all right, maybe 85.

48:43.480 --> 48:46.480
Put Carl back on the microphone.

48:46.480 --> 48:48.480
So then on the microphone.

48:48.480 --> 48:49.480
Yeah.

48:49.480 --> 48:51.480
And then Carl hangs up the phone.

48:51.480 --> 48:53.480
They talk about chicken for a few minutes.

48:53.480 --> 48:55.480
They can't hear, so they have a microphone on the telephone.

48:55.480 --> 48:56.480
I know.

48:56.480 --> 48:57.480
I think he was just being cute.

48:57.480 --> 48:58.480
So then I forget that, Mike.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.480
I forget to ask him about the feathers.

49:00.480 --> 49:01.480
What's the chicken feathers?

49:01.480 --> 49:02.480
What are you and Mel?

49:02.480 --> 49:03.480
What is that about?

49:03.480 --> 49:04.480
He goes, all right.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.480
You want to know?

49:05.480 --> 49:06.480
Yeah.

49:06.480 --> 49:08.480
And he points to the publicist who's on the couch.

49:08.480 --> 49:10.480
He goes, oh, you got a pillow behind you?

49:10.480 --> 49:11.480
Can you feel anything?

49:11.480 --> 49:12.480
Just give me the pillow.

49:12.480 --> 49:15.480
So this guy hands Carl the pillow.

49:15.480 --> 49:16.480
And Carl is sitting down.

49:16.480 --> 49:23.480
He puts the pillow on his lap and very delicately starts running his hand over this pillow like this.

49:23.480 --> 49:24.480
And then he goes, ooh.

49:24.480 --> 49:27.480
And he pulls a feather out of the pillow, right?

49:27.480 --> 49:29.480
Like a down feather, you know?

49:29.480 --> 49:32.480
And he puts it, and he very delicately puts it on the armrest.

49:32.480 --> 49:35.480
And he says, I put these in a bag.

49:35.480 --> 49:37.480
I've got a lot of them.

49:37.480 --> 49:38.480
Yeah.

49:38.480 --> 49:42.480
And he goes, I don't know what I'm going to do with them, but I got a lot of them.

49:42.480 --> 49:45.480
And then he starts running his hand over the pillow again.

49:45.480 --> 49:48.480
I go, what's this have to do with you sitting here for hours with Mel Brooks?

49:48.480 --> 49:52.480
He goes, this is what we do.

49:52.480 --> 49:55.480
Marc Maron, everybody.

49:55.480 --> 49:58.480
That was a new cement called the full Jew.

49:58.480 --> 49:59.480
Yeah.

49:59.480 --> 50:00.480
The full Jew.

50:00.480 --> 50:01.480
Hilarious.

50:01.480 --> 50:02.480
A new segment.

50:02.480 --> 50:05.480
We're going to bring Maron back every week and do the full Jew.

50:05.480 --> 50:07.480
If he can stay in with these guys.

50:07.480 --> 50:08.480
Are you kidding?

50:08.480 --> 50:11.480
I could do that any night of the week.

50:11.480 --> 50:19.480
So I think we got a sneak hint of it, but I did want to ask, is there anything specific

50:19.480 --> 50:25.480
that you said Bob to Robin Williams on that set that resulted in me going, holy shit,

50:25.480 --> 50:31.480
that guy's me instead of the guy from Hook instead of the guy from Mrs. Doubtfire.

50:31.480 --> 50:32.480
Yeah.

50:32.480 --> 50:36.480
I pulled him aside and I said, don't be so Jewish.

50:36.480 --> 50:38.480
That's what I say to every actor.

50:38.480 --> 50:39.480
Okay.

50:39.480 --> 50:40.480
Okay.

50:40.480 --> 50:41.480
Okay, Bobby.

50:41.480 --> 50:42.480
Okay.

50:42.480 --> 50:44.480
That's not how he talks.

50:44.480 --> 50:45.480
He doesn't go.

50:45.480 --> 50:46.480
Okay.

50:46.480 --> 50:47.480
Okay.

50:47.480 --> 50:48.480
He goes.

50:48.480 --> 50:49.480
He doesn't do anything.

50:49.480 --> 50:50.480
Hey, good.

50:50.480 --> 50:51.480
Hey, good.

50:51.480 --> 50:52.480
Yeah.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.480
Stop it.

50:53.480 --> 50:54.480
Stop it.

50:54.480 --> 50:55.480
I'm not going to talk.

50:55.480 --> 50:56.480
Don't be afraid.

50:56.480 --> 50:57.480
Don't be afraid.

50:57.480 --> 50:58.480
I gotta stand up like this now.

50:58.480 --> 50:59.480
Like this.

50:59.480 --> 51:00.480
Nope.

51:00.480 --> 51:01.480
Oh.

51:01.480 --> 51:03.480
Both of you can fucking cram it.

51:03.480 --> 51:04.480
Here's how it goes.

51:04.480 --> 51:05.480
Uh-oh.

51:05.480 --> 51:06.480
Dueling.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.480
Dueling Williams.

51:07.480 --> 51:12.480
That was wonderful.

51:12.480 --> 51:15.480
Drop the mic.

51:15.480 --> 51:17.480
Drop the mic.

51:17.480 --> 51:20.480
Bob can't go through it, everybody.

51:20.480 --> 51:21.480
Yeah.

51:21.480 --> 51:24.480
That seems like a good exit for both of you.

51:24.480 --> 51:29.480
Bobcat Goldwaite and Marc Maron came to Harmontown.

51:29.480 --> 51:30.480
Thank you.

51:30.480 --> 51:31.480
I'm sorry.

51:31.480 --> 51:32.480
I smell like an onion.

51:32.480 --> 51:34.480
No, you do too.

51:34.480 --> 51:39.480
So awesome.

51:39.480 --> 51:40.480
That was wonderful.

51:40.480 --> 51:41.480
That was beautiful.

51:41.480 --> 51:42.480
No, no, no.

51:42.480 --> 51:43.480
Yeah.

51:43.480 --> 51:44.480
Mr. Happy.

51:44.480 --> 51:47.480
This isn't a cup.

51:47.480 --> 51:48.480
It's a hat.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.480
Don't be afraid.

51:50.480 --> 51:51.480
Don't be afraid.

51:51.480 --> 51:54.480
Oh, so many people out there.

51:54.480 --> 51:59.480
Oh, so I feel like my dick could fuck everybody.

51:59.480 --> 52:00.480
Let's see.

52:00.480 --> 52:01.480
I can't do it.

52:01.480 --> 52:02.480
He's magic.

52:02.480 --> 52:07.480
Can we get Spencer Crittenden into the stage, please?

52:07.480 --> 52:08.480
Spencer.

52:08.480 --> 52:16.480
Judgent master to the stars.

52:16.480 --> 52:19.480
Storyteller extraordinaire.

52:19.480 --> 52:24.480
He approaches the stage, clad in red flannel.

52:24.480 --> 52:28.480
His beard is both inviting and repellent.

52:28.480 --> 52:35.480
He is the master of all worlds, inhabitant of none.

52:35.480 --> 52:40.480
Spencer, Creighton Dinsen, friend.

52:40.480 --> 52:44.480
His name was improvised by Chevy Chase.

52:44.480 --> 52:48.480
Spencer, Creighton Dinsen.

52:48.480 --> 52:50.480
Spencer, welcome back to Los Angeles, man.

52:50.480 --> 52:55.480
By the way, what a fucking asshole move that was.

52:55.480 --> 52:59.480
Rewind, edit that out, say that again, and go.

52:59.480 --> 53:01.480
Spencer, welcome back to Los Angeles.

53:01.480 --> 53:04.480
You know what I love about cookies?

53:04.480 --> 53:09.480
A booyah, booyah, everybody booyah.

53:09.480 --> 53:12.480
A booyah, booyah rap, special booyah rap.

53:12.480 --> 53:15.480
Got a booyah rap about the word booyah.

53:15.480 --> 53:18.480
A booyah, booyah.

53:18.480 --> 53:20.480
Do it again, do it again, do it again.

53:20.480 --> 53:21.480
For real, I won't do it again.

53:21.480 --> 53:24.480
Spencer, it's great to see you back in Los Angeles, man.

53:24.480 --> 53:27.480
It's good to be back in Los Angeles.

53:27.480 --> 53:29.480
What can I say?

53:29.480 --> 53:30.480
Yeah.

53:30.480 --> 53:34.480
Although, you're from, what, more parks in the valley?

53:34.480 --> 53:36.480
Yeah, more park.

53:36.480 --> 53:38.480
Jason to see me valley.

53:38.480 --> 53:41.480
So you don't really call Los Angeles like a Hollywood home.

53:41.480 --> 53:43.480
You're a visitor here more or less, aren't you?

53:43.480 --> 53:46.480
I'm explaining it to people who don't live in Los Angeles.

53:46.480 --> 53:49.480
I say I live outside of Los Angeles.

53:49.480 --> 53:50.480
That's about it.

53:50.480 --> 53:53.480
That's not even a joke.

53:53.480 --> 53:57.480
That's my life.

53:57.480 --> 53:58.480
That's no joke.

53:58.480 --> 53:59.480
That's my life.

53:59.480 --> 54:00.480
Yeah, man.

54:00.480 --> 54:04.480
Wait, it's really staying Jewish up here.

54:04.480 --> 54:05.480
It's fine.

54:05.480 --> 54:06.480
That's good.

54:06.480 --> 54:08.480
Spencer, they're good people.

54:08.480 --> 54:09.480
They're chosen people.

54:09.480 --> 54:12.480
Harmon said that he's learned nothing from this tour that we did.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.480
Did you learn anything?

54:13.480 --> 54:21.480
I learned, yeah, I learned that I'm apparently pretty great.

54:21.480 --> 54:22.480
People like you.

54:22.480 --> 54:23.480
I agree.

54:23.480 --> 54:24.480
Yeah.

54:24.480 --> 54:25.480
They like you just the way you are.

54:25.480 --> 54:28.480
I kept telling them not to, but it didn't stop them.

54:28.480 --> 54:30.480
You are a contrarian by nature.

54:30.480 --> 54:39.480
You explained to me, you constantly try to offset the weight of whatever the universe

54:39.480 --> 54:40.480
is dealing you kind of.

54:40.480 --> 54:41.480
I'm paraphrasing you.

54:41.480 --> 54:47.480
You disagree with things for the sake of it kind of because you find that that often is

54:47.480 --> 54:48.480
needed.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.480
Yeah.

54:49.480 --> 54:52.480
It's like if there's too many people saying a thing, I'm like, well, they must be wrong.

54:52.480 --> 54:53.480
Right.

54:53.480 --> 54:54.480
They have to be.

54:54.480 --> 54:55.480
Yeah.

54:55.480 --> 54:56.480
I agree with that.

54:56.480 --> 54:59.480
But the dilemma is the world saying they love you.

54:59.480 --> 55:00.480
Yeah.

55:00.480 --> 55:01.480
It gets complicated.

55:01.480 --> 55:02.480
Because they're wrong.

55:02.480 --> 55:05.480
On one hand, they must be in your view.

55:05.480 --> 55:07.480
But on the other hand, they outnumber you.

55:07.480 --> 55:08.480
Great.

55:08.480 --> 55:13.480
Do you think that you made any like online or in person foes or enemies during this trip?

55:13.480 --> 55:16.480
Did you ever actually piss anybody off or rub anybody the wrong way?

55:16.480 --> 55:17.480
I don't.

55:17.480 --> 55:18.480
I hope not.

55:18.480 --> 55:19.480
I don't think so.

55:19.480 --> 55:22.480
I tried my hardest not to do that.

55:22.480 --> 55:23.480
Yeah.

55:23.480 --> 55:24.480
Do you think you went on a journey?

55:24.480 --> 55:27.480
You're probably familiar by now with my hacky story model.

55:27.480 --> 55:29.480
Like you're a dungeon master.

55:29.480 --> 55:30.480
You're a writer.

55:30.480 --> 55:31.480
You're a storyteller.

55:31.480 --> 55:38.480
Like, you know that I draw this circle and that I wrap all of it around it and follows

55:38.480 --> 55:39.480
these eight steps.

55:39.480 --> 55:42.480
It's all stolen from Joseph Campbell to field and stuff.

55:42.480 --> 55:44.480
And like, did you see yourself?

55:44.480 --> 55:46.480
Do you think that you went on a little journey?

55:46.480 --> 55:49.480
I mean, I didn't go like placing myself around the wheel.

55:49.480 --> 55:51.480
But yeah, it was definitely a journey.

55:51.480 --> 55:52.480
I learned some stuff.

55:52.480 --> 55:55.480
I returned to hopefully a better person.

55:55.480 --> 55:57.480
What do you think changed about you?

55:57.480 --> 55:58.480
It's different in your head.

55:58.480 --> 56:02.480
I think that before, I was really afraid of social interaction.

56:02.480 --> 56:08.720
But you know, when you're friggin' talking to like 30 people who are mostly wasted and

56:08.720 --> 56:16.480
like a bar like 20 times, you know, in a row, that's the worst.

56:16.480 --> 56:19.480
So everything else, anything else is...

56:19.480 --> 56:20.480
That's as bad as it gets.

56:20.480 --> 56:21.480
Yeah.

56:21.480 --> 56:24.480
So like literally, I was coming home and I was like, my friends want to hang out.

56:24.480 --> 56:26.480
And I was like, two people?

56:26.480 --> 56:28.480
That's workable.

56:28.480 --> 56:30.480
Yeah.

56:30.480 --> 56:31.480
So...

56:31.480 --> 56:35.480
I hear our $1,000 VIPs down here talking about their character sheets.

56:35.480 --> 56:37.480
They're discussing D&D strategies.

56:37.480 --> 56:39.480
We have two people...

56:39.480 --> 56:42.480
Wait, for $1,000, you get up on stage and play D&D?

56:42.480 --> 56:43.480
Yeah, that's fucking...

56:43.480 --> 56:44.480
It's a real deal.

56:44.480 --> 56:45.480
Spencer is a rock star.

56:45.480 --> 56:48.480
Nobody would have paid $1,000 just to get up here.

56:48.480 --> 56:52.480
Merin only did it because he wants to plug his IFC show, you know?

56:52.480 --> 56:54.480
All right, yeah, the show Merin starts in May.

56:54.480 --> 56:56.480
You know, by the way, yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:56.480 --> 56:58.480
He didn't really do it to plug it.

56:58.480 --> 57:02.480
I did see the pilot and I think he's got a straight shot at it.

57:02.480 --> 57:03.480
And Bobcat, we didn't plug it.

57:03.480 --> 57:06.480
We're not really a pluggy show, but Bobcat's new film is God Bless America, right?

57:06.480 --> 57:08.480
Yeah, go check that out.

57:08.480 --> 57:13.480
Also, shit, we should have talked to him about his Bigfoot movie, too.

57:13.480 --> 57:14.480
You showed me...

57:14.480 --> 57:19.480
You tried to show me the trailer for it after I abused my girlfriend and came to your hotel room

57:19.480 --> 57:24.480
and you offered me your pizza and tried to show me your trailer on the shitty Wi-Fi at the hotel.

57:24.480 --> 57:27.480
But anyways, just Google Bob Goldthwaite.

57:27.480 --> 57:28.480
What's your...

57:28.480 --> 57:29.480
Relax.

57:29.480 --> 57:30.480
It's not...

57:30.480 --> 57:32.480
It's that goddamn 50s.

57:32.480 --> 57:35.480
Just go out there and consume his work.

57:35.480 --> 57:37.480
Out there working for you.

57:37.480 --> 57:40.480
Assholes, terrible people.

57:40.480 --> 57:43.480
It's fitting that this place is called the Egyptian.

57:43.480 --> 57:47.480
You're a bunch of tyrants, pharaohs.

57:47.480 --> 57:48.480
This is the dark point of the show.

57:48.480 --> 57:50.480
This is where it fits into the story circle.

57:50.480 --> 57:52.480
This is the atonement.

57:52.480 --> 57:54.480
Hate you.

57:54.480 --> 57:56.480
Hate Jesus.

57:56.480 --> 57:58.480
Hate my father.

57:58.480 --> 58:00.480
I am my father.

58:00.480 --> 58:03.480
Jesus is my father.

58:07.480 --> 58:10.480
You in the podcast, I'm ripping open my shirt.

58:10.480 --> 58:11.480
There's blood everywhere.

58:11.480 --> 58:13.480
I'm bleeding out of my nipples.

58:13.480 --> 58:15.480
I'm pissing into a jar.

58:15.480 --> 58:20.480
There's a... there's a... there's a... a dreidel in it.

58:20.480 --> 58:23.480
There's a bullwhip up my asses.

58:23.480 --> 58:25.480
Now, oh, whoo! Resurrection.

58:25.480 --> 58:26.480
Now we're back.

58:26.480 --> 58:28.480
Let's have some fun.

58:28.480 --> 58:30.480
Uh, you... you... you...

58:30.480 --> 58:32.480
What was I... how was I derailing when you...

58:32.480 --> 58:33.480
I got excited about something.

58:33.480 --> 58:35.480
That's why I was derailing, you guys.

58:35.480 --> 58:37.480
You came up and you sat down and then you're... goddammit.

58:37.480 --> 58:39.480
He was just asking me how I was doing.

58:39.480 --> 58:41.480
It's like... it wasn't a big deal.

58:41.480 --> 58:43.480
I know, but I thought of something for some reason.

58:43.480 --> 58:45.480
I thought of something so important, otherwise I wouldn't do that.

58:45.480 --> 58:48.480
You said your story circle about him changing...

58:48.480 --> 58:50.480
Anybody?

58:50.480 --> 58:51.480
Chevy Chase.

58:51.480 --> 58:52.480
You... you were about...

58:52.480 --> 58:54.480
Oh, Chevy called me back. That's what all... that's what it was.

58:54.480 --> 58:59.480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

58:59.480 --> 59:00.480
Wait, what the fuck?

59:00.480 --> 59:02.480
Impeccable timing is off.

59:02.480 --> 59:05.480
Adam Goldberg has just stormed the stage, ladies and gentlemen.

59:05.480 --> 59:06.480
Wow.

59:06.480 --> 59:07.480
Yeah, yeah.

59:07.480 --> 59:12.480
To... to... to 3% applause, Adam.

59:12.480 --> 59:13.480
More than I deserve.

59:13.480 --> 59:14.480
This ain't Nerd Meltz.

59:14.480 --> 59:16.480
This is a fucking... this is a theater full of adults.

59:16.480 --> 59:18.480
I know these people... these people paid good money to be here

59:18.480 --> 59:21.480
instead of their typical bad money.

59:21.480 --> 59:22.480
But...

59:22.480 --> 59:24.480
What brings you up here, Adam Goldberg?

59:24.480 --> 59:27.480
Dan has come home having changed.

59:27.480 --> 59:28.480
Huh?

59:28.480 --> 59:31.480
Dan has changed and reached the apex of the story circle

59:31.480 --> 59:36.480
because before we got derailed, he was doing an excellent interview with Spencer.

59:36.480 --> 59:38.480
Oh, damn.

59:38.480 --> 59:39.480
And that's it.

59:39.480 --> 59:40.480
And you let me this.

59:40.480 --> 59:43.480
Big red left a note that I didn't read.

59:43.480 --> 59:44.480
But...

59:44.480 --> 59:49.480
Does anybody have any idea what's fucking currently happening on this stage?

59:49.480 --> 59:51.480
He gave him a thing.

59:51.480 --> 59:56.480
Adam, we went away for a while and we all changed.

59:56.480 --> 59:59.480
But apparently you're just gonna come storm the goddamn stage

59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.480
and do some abstruse bullshit.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:07.480
The thing about Adam Goldberg is this is something... this is a typical example.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:11.480
Too much information per second.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.480
Right?

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.480
He just returned my copy of The Master.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.480
There's a note from Big Red.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.480
Like if I had to...

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.480
Looking at it through Bob Goldway's eyes.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.480
What the fuck is going on?

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.480
Right.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.480
And what would I need to do to explain to Bob Goldway what is happening?

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.480
I would need to extrapolate...

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.480
I borrowed in my... lent him my Master DVD, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.480
Then you get into who is Adam Goldberg.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.480
Let's talk about Adam Goldberg.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.480
Should we get Marc Maron up to the full Jew with Adam Goldberg right now?

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.480
Please?

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.480
I think Marin might have boned out.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.480
If he hasn't, go run.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.480
Yeah, get out of here, Marin. You got bigger fish to fry.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:55.480
You are the Barbara Walters of everything.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:00.480
The Goldberg, we met your brothers in Somerville in Massachusetts.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.480
All right.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.480
For those of you who are tuning in for the first time,

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.480
I can't imagine any of you would be coming here for the first time,

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:13.480
but Adam Goldberg is our hamburger.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.480
He is that part of the mythology that strengthens the mythology

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.480
by his covetous desire for it.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.480
Like Daffy Duck wants that pearl.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.480
Mine, mine, mine.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.480
And the clamshell slowly closes on him.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.480
And your heart bleeds for him.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.480
You love to hate him.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.480
The hamburger, he loves hamburgers.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.480
But he never gets the fruity pebbles.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.480
He never gets the fruity pebbles because he's the hamburger.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.480
If he got him, he wouldn't know what to do with him.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.480
And Adam loves stage time.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:53.480
So the people in Los Angeles who are trained to be restrained

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:59.480
because their starfucker muscle is strained, boom, boom, boom, boom.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.480
No, go with that.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.480
I want to know what the starfucker muscle is.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.480
The people in Los Angeles, they know...

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.480
Starfucker.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.480
Yeah.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.480
Starfucker.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.480
When you live in LA, you learn if David Duchovny is behind you,

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.480
don't turn.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.480
Don't look at him.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.480
He's a living ghost.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.480
So what?

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.480
He was on X-Files.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.480
Who gives a fuck?

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.480
It's the coast.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.480
You came out here to work and be creative.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.480
So who the fuck cares if there's famous people?

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.480
Eat your potatoes.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:33.480
That's the starfucker muscle is withered here.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.480
Goldthwaite was applauding.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:41.480
Now I'm obsessed with doing a show to Goldthwaite.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.480
This is my theory about you, having been to Somerville.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.480
And also looking on the forums where you proudly proclaim...

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.480
Most viewed thread.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.480
Thread.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.480
Everyone's like, I love out in Goldberg, electronically.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.480
People in Los Angeles, pretty much, they roundly like...

01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.480
They don't like you.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.480
They don't want...

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.480
You're not a hero to them.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.480
Because I took their hamburgers.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.480
Because you took...

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.480
Because you...

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.480
Because there was a plate of hamburgers out.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.480
Ronald put it out there.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.480
There's a rainbow.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.480
There's fries dancing around.

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.480
It's a magical world where supposedly anyone can have anything they want,

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.480
because there's no crime.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.480
And then to you, to them, you represent the...

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.480
Yeah, it's like, oh shit.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.480
And then I think they go, hey, I want to get up on stage too.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.480
But I don't.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.480
Fuck this guy.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.480
That's what I think they think.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480
Wow.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.480
Bullseye.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.480
Bob Goldthwaite's back on stage, everybody.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.480
I'm Mary McCheese.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.480
Wait.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480
Wait.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.480
No, you're done.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480
What's happening?

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.480
You're done.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.480
I'm retiring.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.480
What's happening?

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480
I'm retiring.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.480
I'm retiring as a character from Harmontown.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.480
Bob Goldthwaite just bounced Adam Goldberg off stage.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.480
Thanks for coming.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.480
That was great.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.480
Is he banged?

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.480
Bounced him.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:08.480
Bob Goldthwaite.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.480
World's most famous bouncer.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.480
Boy, can you come every Monday to meltdown?

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:27.480
That was like the best.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.480
How was the master?

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:36.480
It was, for the first 20 minutes of that movie, I couldn't wait for it to be over so I could

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.480
go tell everyone I just saw the best movie of my life.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:45.480
And then for the last 80 to 600 minutes of it, I was like, okay.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:50.480
I'm kind of riding this porpoise to the bottom of the ocean.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.480
Ocean depth in that metaphor is movie quality.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.480
And porpoises are deep-seeing animals.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.480
Or not.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.480
Look, hey, I'm not a metaphorologist.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.480
I'm just a guy that wandered into a fucking movie.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:09.480
But Joaquin Phoenix, what's his name?

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.480
Fake Jack Black.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.480
Philip Seymour Hoffman.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.480
Amazing.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.480
Amazing.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.480
I mean, see the movie for Jesus Christ.

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.480
Some actors.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.480
Holy shit.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.480
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.480
Jesus fucking Christ, chef.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480
Take it easy.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.480
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.480
Joaquin Phoenix.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.480
I'm fucking good.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.480
Let's meet our $1,000 D&D people, shall we?

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.480
Wait.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.480
We got another guest.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.480
We do.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:41.480
Dude, his ball got cancer.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.480
He just came out of radiation.

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:44.480
David Blaine, everybody.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.480
Welcome, David Blaine, to the stage.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.480
Now, who is it?

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.480
It's our very good friends, my podcast buddy.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:57.480
The ratio of how much time I've spent with him to how much I love him is more concentrated

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.480
than any human being I know.

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:00.480
Get jealous.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.480
Feel the jealousy.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.480
Embrace the jealousy.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:12.480
When you watch me make mad verbal love to Duncan Tressel.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.480
Yeah.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.480
Duncan Tressel.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:15.480
Yeah.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.480
Duncan Tressel.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.480
Yeah.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.880
Gonna have a drunken Tressel with Duncan Tressel.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.480
My name is Russell.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.480
Russell.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.480
Russell Simmons is gonna give it.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.480
Little Gibbons got a cancer in the ball.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.480
Gonna talk about it.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.480
Got some radiation, radiation, radiation.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.480
Just got out of radiation for his nut.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.480
Hello, Duncan.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.480
Hi.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.480
Duncan Tressel, everybody.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.480
Hey, buddy.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.480
Hi.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.480
Hey.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.480
Good to see you.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480
Hey.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.480
Man, you're a good rapper.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.480
Thank you, buddy.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.480
Hi.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.480
Duncan has an amazing podcast that everyone should listen to.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.480
I was a guest on it.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.480
I listened to that episode.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.480
And loved it.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480
And loved you.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:07:05.480
We had a big talk about robots and the future of sperm.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.480
Oh, yeah, man.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.480
We got into the singularity.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.480
And we really hit, you know, that wall you hit sometimes where you run out of words.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.480
And you're just sort of stumbling around.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.480
That's my favorite place to get to.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.480
We definitely got there.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.480
It's a place called Love.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.480
I love you.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.480
I love you.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.480
And we vowed to be best friends on that podcast, but we don't really hang out.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.480
But, you know, you locked yourself in the bathroom and I came over.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.480
Oh, yeah, you saved me.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.480
That's right.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.480
I forgot.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.480
That was such a humiliating, but awesome moment.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480
I did what I could.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.480
I locked myself in my bathroom at my house.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.480
I was taking a dump.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.480
Forgive me for saying that.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:47.480
And I, uh, I live in this old house and it just, the door just locked.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.480
It's just like Amadeville horror style locked.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.480
And it's the mid, it's summer.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.480
It was summer and it was so hot in there.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.480
And I started hearing the narrator from those death shows in my head.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:05.480
Like, he didn't realize this would be the last dump he ever took in his life.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.480
They found him two weeks later.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.480
Calling out the window to neighbors.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.480
Yeah, that's how I ended up.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.480
That's the really say when you're locked in your bathroom, what do you call out of the window?

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.480
Do you say help?

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.480
Or is that too much?

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:19.480
I would go, that's too much.

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.480
I don't want to think I'm on fire.

01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.480
I'll live.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.480
I'm alone.

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:29.480
I live alone and I'm alone.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:32.480
This is, this is something that happens to geriatrics.

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.480
It's like, that's an elderly death.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.480
That's where the cat chews your face off style.

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.480
I'm 12 years older than my girlfriend.

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.480
And we were, we saw a billboard for the, for the life alert thing.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.480
And by the way, their slogan is I've fallen and I can't get up and it's trademarked now.

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:54.480
Which is like a weird thing because that's a person dying.

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:59.480
We know that's, that's a famous saying from your thing, but it's not like where's the beef?

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.480
It's like I've fallen and I can't get up.

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.480
That's not, I've fallen.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.480
I'm dying.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.480
You're trademarking the most common thing you hear if you're a 911 dispatcher.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.480
Yeah, like, I don't know.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.480
I don't know what's funny about it.

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480
I know it's just funny.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.480
It's like the opposite of trademarking the birthday song.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:22.480
But we started joking about how I should get one of those because I'm 12 years older than her.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.480
And then the joke turned into sincere.

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:29.480
It's good if you got one that might help.

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.480
Those commercials are so existentially horrifying.

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.480
There's a line in one of those commercials.

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:42.480
This old lady says, I live alone and I don't get many visitors.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.480
It's like the worst, worst way to end up.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.480
Well, we're born into these bodies and then we're like, like a whole,

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.480
so you use a brain and then there's the puppet and the puppets made of meat.

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:55.480
And then there's maybe a God or maybe there isn't somewhere in between.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.480
No idea what's going to happen when we die.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.480
We just know that it's going to be a drag when we do.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:00.480
It's not going to be fun.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.480
No one ever has fun when they die.

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.480
Nobody.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.480
Oh, I know Steve Job said, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, or whatever.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.480
But I think he was like, oh, whoa, this hurts.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.480
Like, or wow.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:16.480
We don't, I don't think, I think, I don't think death is that bad a thing at all.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.480
That's what I'm fishing for.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.480
My recent running with cancer made me think that it's, it's not.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.480
Well, for one, the one thing you realize is that this is not new terrain.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:33.480
Like you realize there's this well worn path into oblivion that they've worked out for us already.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.480
Like other humans or humans.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.480
Yeah, like just the medical system.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.480
I mean, dying is so good these days.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.480
The drugs are so good.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.480
The narcotics are incredible.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.480
You're going to, Steve Job said, wow, wow, wow.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.480
Because he was on Dilaudid and narcotics.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.480
And then maybe he saw God or something.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:00.480
But there's this thing Ramadan says, which I've thought about a lot.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.480
Which he says, dying is safe.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.480
And it's, it is, it's like the very safe thing.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.480
It's the most normal thing that can happen outside of being born.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.480
That is true because like rocks are dead.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.480
They're everywhere.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.480
Like aluminum is dead.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.480
It's the most abundant element in the Earth's crust.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.480
It's like no big deal to be dead.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.480
Yeah, it isn't a big, it isn't a big deal.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.480
It's a, I mean, thank goodness we.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.480
It's as easy as falling off a log in a very specific angle that will, that snaps your neck.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.480
It's preferable to living forever.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.480
Yeah, probably.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.480
Because forever would be, yeah.

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.480
There is no, I mean, it's one of those things that like, like we always, you know,

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.480
everybody in this room is at least 25 or whatever they've all been down this road of like,

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.480
okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, because you're a human being.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.480
So if life wasn't scarce, then it wouldn't be valuable.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.480
You wouldn't enjoy it and all that stuff.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.480
But it's like, it's one of those things like what your mom says,

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.480
oh, those guys that beat you up shouldn't be your friends anyway.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:01.480
Like, like you, you hear it, but hearing it and understanding it are separate

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.480
from like realizing it in your heart.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.480
Yes.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.480
Like really getting it.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.480
Like, like, like that whole concept of like, well, you're alive and you're going to die

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.480
and, and it sucks that you're going to die.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:17.480
But because it sucks that you're going to die, your life is valuable.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.480
Otherwise it wouldn't be because you'd just be hanging out.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.480
Like you'd just be like Highlander, like, like fucking around.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.480
The sun's going to supernova.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.480
You're going to be floating through the void of space screaming for infinity,

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.480
like one of those probes.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.480
Well, if you're immortal, so does that cat, so that you would do the sun would supernova

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.480
and you'd just be a dude floating around?

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480
Where are you going to stand?

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.480
I don't know.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.480
So you just speak.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.480
Our son would read giant first and envelop us.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.480
We'd all, we'd all cook.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.480
You'd have to be on a ship.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:47.480
I'm assuming you're immortal and you have like your skin doesn't burn.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.480
Right, it doesn't burn.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.480
So I'm just imagining.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.480
So you're just hanging out.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.480
You're just, it's the ultimate horror would be to be immortal.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.480
And then you just, hey, you're just standing in space like Space Ghost.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.480
Yeah.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.480
Like waiting for, all right.

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.480
And then you start walking like in Minecraft.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:05.480
Like it's just no end, like you just like, I don't know when I'm ever going to find

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.480
another planet.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:09.480
And then when you do, everyone's like, Hey, who are you?

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.480
And you're like, my name's Ted and I can't die.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.480
And they're like, fuck you.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.480
No, you don't say, you don't say anything when you run.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480
You open an antique store.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480
After six.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.480
And you wear a trench coat.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.480
You walk around New York being bitter.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.480
They start a religion about you.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.480
You become a shitty deity.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.480
And you'd be over it.

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.480
You'd hate it.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.480
Yeah.

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.480
Like everything would be, yeah, nothing would be exciting.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.480
You'd never be able to love anyone.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:37.480
Well, this is Alan Watts idea where he says, if you live forever, you would try everything

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:42.480
that you could try till eventually, if you were God, you'd be like, oh, I wonder what

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.480
it's like to be mortal.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:47.480
And that's when you pop into this body and become Dan Harmon.

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.480
Huh.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.480
Or Highlander.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.480
Or Highlander.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:56.480
But that is the, that's the idea is that, that we're sort of like the way we have to

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:02.480
sleep or we'll go crazy in the same way, like we're what happens when God falls asleep.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:09.480
We think that we're impermanent mortal beings because the state of pure immortality for

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.480
eternity, there's nothing more horrifying and claustrophobic.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:17.480
So we're kind of what happens when God has a nervous breakdown and shatters into an infinite

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.480
number of nodes of consciousness.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.480
Yeah.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:26.480
And in the beginning there was nothing and then nothing is fucking dumb and has forever

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.480
to be something.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480
Yes.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.480
So it did because otherwise it would have gone nuts and what, and did.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.480
It did.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.480
So it's split into Duncan Trussell and Dan Harmon and Spencer and Jeff and maybe a little

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.480
bit of Adam Goldberg.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.480
And it just like looks, we just look at ourselves.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.480
It's just God like rubbing himself in a mirror.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.480
Yeah.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.480
Yeah.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.480
It looked good in the sailor outfit.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.480
Oh yeah.

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.480
Like every person's a little finger and like, yeah.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:58.480
But then the merciful Bob Goldthwaite of eternity comes and just shoes you off into nothing

01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.480
this again.

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.480
I'm afraid he's going to bounce me.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.480
Me too.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.480
I never knew the mayor of McCheese had like, I never thought of him as a mayor.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.480
It really is.

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.480
He has power.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.480
Give me something to get.

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.480
Ronald, Ronald, Ronald's in charge.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.480
No.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.480
Fucking Mayor McCheese.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:15.480
There's a mayor.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:16.480
Ronald's a clown.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.480
People need to look into this.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.480
Ronald's a fucking clown.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.480
He's like a tool of the state.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.480
Mayor McCheese is like, he barely says anything.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.480
I got shit to do.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.480
He's like Dick Cheney.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.480
He's sitting back on.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480
I don't want to be president.

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480
I don't give a fuck.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.480
I got a big dick and a fucking missile for a heart.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:39.480
Talk about your balls.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:45.480
Talk a little bit about like everyone in this room or at least half of us are at risk of

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.480
testicular cancer.

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.480
Is that the specific?

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.480
Was that what you got?

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.480
Yes.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.480
I got testicular cancer.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.480
Yes.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.480
It's called.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.480
How did you find out?

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.480
What is that?

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.480
Testicular cancer.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.480
I don't know.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.480
It's going to be a good time in the Egyptian.

01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.480
Talking about the cancer in your bones.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.480
It's going to claim us all.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.480
If it's not your prostate, it'll be your nuts.

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.480
Fellas.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480
It's going to claim us all.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.480
If it's not your prostate, it'll be your nuts.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.480
Fellas.

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.480
Fellas.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.480
Fellas.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.480
Fellas.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.480
Fellas.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.480
Fellas.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.480
Fellas.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.480
Fellas.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.480
Fellas.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.480
Fellas.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:14.480
Fellas.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.480
Fellas.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480
I'm sorry, Duncan.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.480
That was not fair.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.480
No, that was awesome.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.480
I just thought you could talk about your balls.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.480
We've put on some sexy music.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.480
How do you find out?

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.480
Well.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.480
They tell you to check in the shower.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.480
I never know what that means.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.480
No, you know, this is the funny thing.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.480
I check in the shower every time I go to the shower.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.480
I don't know that I'm doing it.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.480
I'm just doing it.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:40.480
That was so stupid.

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.480
Are you just saying I'm jerking off in the shower?

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.480
I jerk off in the shower a lot.

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.480
You jerk off, you don't rub your balls.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.480
Yes.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.480
Squeeze them like plate out.

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.480
I do.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.480
No one does that.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.480
You don't know that.

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.480
I love rubbing my, squeezing my balls.

01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:01.480
I'm getting such a heart of squeezing my balls.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.480
Anyways.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.480
Can you come from rubbing your balls?

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.480
Yes.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.480
No, I can't.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.480
Yes, you can.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.480
I think it would take like eight years.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:20.480
You know, just watching like Shakespeare in love and kind of just such a slow build.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.480
You have to have an imagination.

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.480
If you were immortal floating through space forever, how many times do you think you'd jerk off?

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.480
You just jerk off all the time, right?

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.480
Yeah.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.480
Like that's all you do.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.480
You'd like fuck Nebulae.

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:40.480
Like rub cosmic dust on your nipples.

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.480
Cancer.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.480
So how do you find out?

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.480
Do you, do you feel a pain?

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.480
Do you feel a lump?

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.480
Do you know one of your balls just gets really big.

01:17:52.480 --> 01:18:00.480
It's not every like got like a lot of a concern that people have expressed behind it is just

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.480
this terror.

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:05.480
And then they're like, now, how did you know what was it like?

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.480
Because, you know, balls are weird anyway.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.480
So it's hard to tell if your balls are okay, no matter what, because they're always wrong.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.480
Yeah.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.480
What, yeah.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.480
What have they ever done that looks normal?

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:22.480
Have you ever laid in bed and watched them like fucking move around?

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.480
It's terrible.

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.480
It's terrible.

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.480
Adjust to the temperature.

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:31.480
This happens to everyone, right?

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:34.480
Are my balls a snail?

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.480
This is amazing.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.480
They're just moving like lava.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:42.480
This one goes out to the ladies in the house.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.480
Balls move.

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.480
You better get used to it.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.480
You think it's fun and games to play with them, but there's a lot more to them.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:55.480
They're pretty gross and weird.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:19:02.480
So yeah, they're weird, and then they dangle, and then they don't dangle, and then they

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.480
ones lower and ones higher.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.480
And always I'm afraid they go like, the doctors go like, hey, check your balls when you're

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.480
in the shower, just squeeze them around.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:13.480
Like when you went to college, there were stickers on the shower stall, like showing

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.480
like diagrams.

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.480
I'm not going to do that to my balls.

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.480
Me either.

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.480
Like fucking squeeze them.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:26.480
They wanted you to squeeze them like a thing from a discovery store.

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.480
I'm trying to get in there.

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.480
That's great.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:34.480
I don't have cancer, but I fucking mangled my...

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:39.480
I'm holding my balls out of protection.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.480
Talking about it.

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.480
It was no mystery for me.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.480
It was like one of my balls was big.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.480
It was like, this is definitely...

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.480
And when you touched it, did it hurt?

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.480
It didn't hurt.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:53.480
It was just, it was, it was weighty.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.480
It was like kind of cool.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:59.480
It was like, ah, look at this big ball.

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:04.480
But you thought, when did your mind, did your mind immediately go, okay...

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:08.480
My mind is always going to like, ah, this is what kills me.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:12.480
So I immediately was like, oh, this is probably what kills you.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:17.480
And then I Google searched, you know, the symptoms and everything's cancer, cancer, cancer.

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.480
And then I went to the doctor and the doctor's like, yeah, this is cancer.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.480
You got cancer.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.480
Did you Google on a Friday?

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:26.480
It always happens to me like, I'll get a lump on my neck or something.

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.480
And then I'll Google lump on neck cancer.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.480
Lo and behold.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.480
Number one hit.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.480
Lump on neck could mean you have cancer.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.480
And I'm like, oh shit, it's Friday.

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.480
It's eight o'clock.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.480
I'll just sit here for the weekend with cancer.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.480
Cancer eraser on my neck.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.480
And then on Monday it falls off.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.480
I'm like, oh, I'm Polish.

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.480
This is a fucking skin tag.

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:50.480
I'm a gross fucking Shrek.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.480
Just have shit growing on me.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.480
Ben Grimm.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.480
What are, what is that?

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.480
What are skin tags?

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.480
That's a Polish thing.

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.480
They call them Polish moles.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.480
You get skin tags.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.480
Wait, what?

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.480
Skin tags.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.480
No shit?

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.480
Like random shit.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.480
Like polyps.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.480
It's a Polish thing.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:06.480
Wow.

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.480
It's kind of like a polyp, yeah.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.480
Hey guys.

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:10.480
Hey.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.480
Oh, hey Spencer.

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:16.480
I went to do Spencer's theme so you could do like, like.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:21.480
Spencer, I'm being attacked by a, a growth, a skin tag.

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:28.480
Climbing feverishly at your neck, you try to remove the odd skin tab.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:35.480
A small square, maybe rounded oval, oddly colored flesh popping out of the side of your neck.

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:38.480
Are you dying?

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.480
Probably not, but it's weird.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.480
Nice.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:51.480
It fails to save versus your shirt collar over a weekend of drinking and then just falls

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.480
off.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:57.480
People tell you not to pick it because it might give you cancer.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.480
Are you all McLeer now, Duncan?

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:04.480
Statistically, I'm in the 95, 90 to, well, it's like between 90, there's a 10% chance

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.480
I'm still fucked, basically.

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.480
What does still fuck mean that it goes to the other ball?

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.480
Well, no.

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:14.480
The cool thing about testicular cancer and.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.480
The coolest thing.

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.480
The coolest thing.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.480
It's a very lazy week.

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:25.480
It's like cancer with its baseball cap on backwards cancer.

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.480
It's like a, it's like.

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.480
It's cancer that shows your balls.

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:36.480
Not ambitious enough for your brain or your pancreas.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:44.480
It's a chest bumping mall shopping universal city walk kind of cancer.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.480
Exactly.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.480
Exactly.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:50.480
It'll broaden itself when Quentin Tarantino makes it.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.480
I don't know what kind of cancer you got left.

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.480
I'll take the balls, man.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.480
Pick ball cancer if you get to pick.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.480
Pick ball cancer because it's the most curable kind, which is why everybody says.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.480
Check your balls because it's, if you catch it in time.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.480
When Lance Armstrong caught it, he was coughing up blood.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.480
One of his balls was the size of an orange.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:13.480
He just ignored it.

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:20.480
He ignored it because he was riding his bike and he was jacked up on awesome weird sports drugs and like fuck it.

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:25.480
And he was like, I'm sure something I did has, you know, yeah.

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:27.480
I ride a bike for a living.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.480
That has to be related to that.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:34.480
But it had gone into his brain and they still cured it, which is why everyone says check, check.

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:41.480
Because if you, if you catch it at the right time, like when I caught it, there's like a 95% cure rate with it.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:46.480
So it's guys, all the guys stand up and reach over, put your right hand out and reach over to your neighbor.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.480
We're going to do it.

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:48.480
We're going to do it.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.480
We're going to save your neighbor's life.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.480
Ball check.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.480
Everybody.

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:52.480
Yes.

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.480
Do do what the man next to you refuses to do for himself.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:02.480
Just get in there and like a key chain, like pretend you're locking your car.

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.480
That's what they want you to do.

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:08.480
Save a Armenian.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.480
Fucking cancer.

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:10.480
Fuck cancer.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.480
Yeah.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.480
I'm not taking a risky stance here.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:24.480
Well, no, if you, I read this incredible thing that cancer, they think is like a primordial version of us or something like from way, way, way back.

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.480
In the distant.

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.480
I don't know.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:37.480
Like I just, because cancer is a, as a stutterer, it's a society cancer is a, is a cell that goes insane.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.480
Yeah.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.480
It doesn't, doesn't play on the same team as it's.

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:44.480
It's Occupy Wall Street in your boss.

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.480
It doesn't.

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:50.480
It, it, it, it forgets that it's a part of a bone.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.480
Yeah.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.480
And just goes, I'm going to try something new.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.480
I'm just me.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.480
I'm Bane.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.480
Yeah.

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.480
Yeah.

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.480
The city of bone is now free.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:01.480
Yeah.

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.480
And it just, it's just a bone and then it just, yeah.

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:14.480
And I guess that would be probably the precursor of like, you know, multicellular life because tissue is cells knowing how to play on a team.

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:19.480
And before that we were unicellular organisms who just multiplied at all costs.

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:39.480
So it is kind of ironic that like, all this years later, these biological weapons called humanity, like, like fucking giant brains that have turned wolves into chihuahuas and giraffes into curiosities and fire into, you know, just more fire.

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:44.480
But I could go on and on.

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:54.480
We, we, we, we, yeah, it was like, I was, I mean, in your nuts, like one little, like, like this thing from the year six billion trillion BC goes like, surprise inward.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.480
Yeah.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.480
Remember your roots, motherfucker.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.480
Yeah.

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.480
It's very strange.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:01.480
Yeah.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.480
It's a very, it's a very strange disease.

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:04.480
And it's very different.

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:13.480
Every, every different, every type is like so different that some of them should maybe have different names, which is why some respond to different types of chemo.

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:17.480
This type that I have responds really well to radiation, which fucking sucks.

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:24.480
So I don't want to, I mean, but I want to follow through this line because, okay, so you had, did you have the thing removed?

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:29.480
I had to get my, I mean, they, that, the doctor was so eager to chop off my balls.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:33.480
Once he found out I had it, he's like, we should do this on Tuesday.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480
I went in.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.480
We should do this every week.

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.480
For two weeks.

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:39.480
We should have Bob Goldway come out.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:44.480
Yeah. So, so yeah, they immediately, they just go, fuck that, get that, get that out.

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.480
Yeah.

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.480
We got to get that in.

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:48.480
You just came here tonight from radiation.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.480
Well, not, no, right.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.480
My radiation ended on, on Friday, but I'm, I'm still super tired from it.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.480
Radiation is crazy.

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.480
It's the most absurd, insane.

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:07.480
I felt like I was in a Fellini movie because they put you in this like, because they want you to feel safe.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:12.480
They designed the radiation machine to look kind of sleek, like a Mercedes or something.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:17.480
It looks like really fancy, but it also looks like a transformer.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:25.480
It's like this living weird thing with arms that you have to lay in and they put this steel cup over your balls.

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:31.480
And you have to like, push your cock into the steel cup and you're laying in this most vulnerable way.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.480
And they fucking play Celine Dion.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.480
No.

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:37.480
No.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.480
Yes.

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.480
Yes.

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.480
It's like Jacob's ladder level hell that's happening.

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:45.480
You're in some kind of hell dimension.

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.480
They build all that shit and they can't ask you what you want to hear.

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:55.480
Well, finally, eventually I got them to play what I wanted to, but the first time you're just so horrified.

01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:05.480
That's actually the radiation. They shoot cold play.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.480
The cancer in your balls is like, I'm out of here.

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:17.480
I heard there's a corn concert in his lungs.

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:28.480
Sworing break is over, man. Cold play showed up. Too fucking, too thoughtful. Not enough rape.

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.480
Cold.

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:35.480
Yeah, every once in a while I'll just throw in the word rape to get your reaction.

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:41.480
Can I ask what you actually, when you took control of the playlist, what did you...

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.480
Sitar music.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.480
Okay, like Ravi Shankar?

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:45.480
Yes, exactly. Yeah, that's what I had.

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:50.480
But it didn't work, though. Nothing works. There's no good music for radiation.

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:51.480
It just relaxes you, yeah.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.480
Not at all. You're still in a machine and you're like, these things are spinning around you.

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.480
I think that's why they probably give you Celine Dion. You didn't like her anyway.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.480
We don't want to ruin your favorite band, Tori.

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.480
Yes, exactly.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.480
We're not going anywhere like if Tori Amos is playing it.

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.480
Okay, well, that's it for this album.

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.480
Whether I make it through or not.

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:13.480
You don't get the kinks in there. You get Celine Dion.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:17.480
Your favorite song is just scratched off your life forever.

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.480
It's like when you get food...

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:24.480
I got food poisoning and had a falafel. Falafels were off the list for a long time.

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.480
Yeah, yeah, I can't drink gin.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:29.480
Don't take the kinks into your testicle or radiation.

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:31.480
No, don't.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.480
And other life lessons.

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.480
Well, thank God you're okay.

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.480
Thanks.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:38.480
But they're going to tell you later...

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.480
I'm sure it's all...

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:46.480
You know, one of my friends said when I told him there's a 95% chance that I'm cured.

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:52.480
He said, oh, well, that just means there's a 95% chance you're going to die of something else.

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:58.480
Actually, Mel Brooks just called. He gave you 80% chance.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:04.480
That was...Sony told me when community got picked up for its second season, they said, congratulations.

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:09.480
Now if you get canceled, you've wasted twice as much money.

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:11.480
Yuck.

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:14.480
They're a good company.

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:21.480
They bring good things to slow death.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:26.480
But not to equate your balls with Sony or anything.

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.480
So all right, well, I don't know. God damn it.

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:34.480
So it's all a big haze. The doctors are going to let you know in the coming weeks.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:42.480
Well, no, I mean, I get to look forward to CT scans like three times a year for the next four years.

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.480
So just to make sure it hasn't spread.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:52.480
It sounds terrible, man, but like really once you get like the water thrown in your face, it's not bad at all.

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:58.480
They kind of imagine it would recalibrate your life in a way that makes telling your landlord to fuck off easier.

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:05.480
So easy, man. But we're all in the exact same boat.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:10.480
It's just I happen to get like a first hand glimpse of mortality.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:15.480
Everyone should not be afraid of telling their landlord to fuck off.

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:22.480
You know, you end up going deep into cliché land when you have cancer.

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:28.480
Everyone that's well dying is like this well trod path.

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:35.480
Everyone goes down. So the thing where they're like, man, I really like appreciate life now and like I'm so happy to be alive.

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:42.480
All that stuff really happens, but you don't need cancer to be happy about your life.

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:46.480
You just need Celine Dion.

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:53.480
Thank you.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.480
I'm out the back of it.

01:31:55.480 --> 01:32:19.480
Thank you.

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:25.480
Fuck your mama so hard, she started to piss into a cup and I drank that shit.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:31.480
And then I rubbed it on my face in her tits and then I put my little wiener in between those things.

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:35.480
And I said, fuck you, I'm going to make you sing.

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:52.480
She said, I'm your mama.

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:56.480
Don't be jealous of him. You can see how much I love him.

01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:00.480
I know. The first time you met him, you had this giant kind of.

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:05.480
I'm sure that happens to everybody. I actually have been told that happens to everybody and I get pissed at them.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:08.480
Fuck you. It's not special.

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:13.480
I met Duncan at a barb very briefly and said hello and I loved him. He's a lovable guy.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:18.480
What are we doing? Let's get out of here. Go hang out with Duncan Tressel.

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:20.480
Until he plays some D&D though.

01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:32.480
Let's bring up our guests.

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:44.480
VIP guests that supported this show and achieved the top tier prize of playing D&D with us.

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:46.480
Let's bring them up right now.

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:57.480
The guys come up. It's Sean. One of them is our old friend Sean Sakame, a.k.a. Snap the Jab.

01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:00.480
The most offensive Twitter name in the world.

01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:09.480
Because apparently he's half Japanese, but he doesn't look Japanese enough to have the name Snap the Jab on Twitter.

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:15.480
Yes, so Sean Sakame and Roy McClurk, everybody, the $1,000 donators. Holy shit.

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:20.480
Discretionary money and no idea what to do with it.

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:25.480
Roy, let's get these guys mic'd up.

01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:28.480
I got one on the floor.

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:34.480
Also, I suppose, let's meet these two before we bring Aaron up. How about that?

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:36.480
Yeah.

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:41.480
Sean, you've been a very original, like, longtime Harmontown fan.

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.480
Come forward. Step to the edge of the stage so folks can see you.

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:50.480
Sean is like the Morgan, wait, what's the name of, well, I was going to say Morgan Freeman,

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:57.480
but his character is Lucius Fox in the Batman universe of Harmontown.

01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:01.480
There's always like a bottle of vodka backstage at the nerd melts from Sean.

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:05.480
Well, I mean, you give so much. It's only fair to get back.

01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.480
Thank you, Sean.

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:07.480
Thank you.

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.480
Thank you.

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.480
And Roy, how do you come to us?

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:14.480
I flew here from Dallas today.

01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:15.480
Lucius?

01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:20.480
Yeah. We're, my wife and I, my wife, who is at the hotel right now.

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.480
Oh, she does not like the show.

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:32.480
I explained the show to her and she was a little taken aback by the fact that we're going to play D&D and talk about dicks and stuff.

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:34.480
And it cost a thousand dollars.

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.480
Yeah.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.480
Maybe you oversold it.

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:40.480
A little bit. A little bit.

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.480
Did she ever listen to it?

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.480
I made her listen to one of them.

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.480
Which one?

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:46.480
It doesn't matter.

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:48.480
Pittsburgh, you know.

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.480
Pittsburgh.

01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:50.480
Pittsburgh.

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:52.480
Oh, she didn't like that. There was raw emotion there.

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.480
No, she liked that part.

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:56.480
But she didn't think it would happen tonight.

01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:57.480
All right.

01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.480
She just, all right.

01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.480
No, she said it does not, you know.

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.480
What's your name?

01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:02.480
Penny.

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.480
Penny, give me a beat.

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:05.480
Yeah, please, please.

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:12.480
Awesome.

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.480
That was angry or the normal, Dan?

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.480
That was angry.

01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:42.480
That was misogyny factor nine.

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.480
I don't like it. You know, yeah.

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.480
Did you take my drink?

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.480
I may have, yeah.

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:50.480
I had a drink.

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:51.480
I'm sorry.

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:53.480
I did warn her about that.

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:56.480
About Dan rap fucking her?

01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:57.480
Yes.

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.480
How are we doing on time?

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:01.480
Apparently she was good with it.

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:04.480
Do we have to be out here by a specific time?

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.480
Yeah.

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:10.480
The, uh, the master is playing, uh, 9 30s.

01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:11.480
All right.

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:12.480
Okay.

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.480
Have a seat.

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:14.480
Let's bring Erin McGathy to the stage as well.

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:15.480
Erin McGathy.

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:16.480
You said Roy.

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:17.480
It's Roy, right?

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:18.480
Yeah.

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:20.480
You said you were in town for the Grammys, right?

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:21.480
Yes, sir.

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:22.480
What, what, why?

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.480
What was it?

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.480
Because my wife, who's not here.

01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:35.480
Bid on a big auction item last year to go to the Grammys.

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:37.480
It was just like a, he's describing heaven.

01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.480
Hello.

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:41.480
Like, like just, so she's not, uh.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.480
She's asleep.

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:46.480
She bid on an auction item that resulted in her, like, like she,

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:50.480
it's a kind of want to contest or like an auction item, like for a charity.

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.480
Yeah, for a charity.

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:55.480
Like, like, like for a Grammy, Grammy Foundation.

01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:56.480
One, one, two, thank you.

01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:57.480
Check, walk two.

01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.480
So then you get to go to the Grammys, do you get good seats or do they,

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:00.480
do they sit in the back?

01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:01.480
I think we have good seats.

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:02.480
I think.

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:03.480
I'm not sure.

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.480
Hey guys.

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.480
Hello, Aaron.

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:06.480
Aaron.

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:19.480
I, uh, I, I wanted, you, you were, you were talking to Bob earlier about our fight

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.480
and the, uh, hotel room.

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:25.480
And, uh, first of all, such a huge fan of yours would have,

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:30.480
it was so excited when, when you were in Atlanta and really wanted to meet you

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:32.480
and miss you because I was doing merchandise.

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.480
And then Dan and I got in this terrible fight, which we talked about the fight that we

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.480
described.

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:39.480
Now our fights are like little babies that we created along the road.

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:44.480
The fight that we described at the Arlington podcast, which led to Pittsburgh was that

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.480
fight.

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:48.480
And Dan, uh, said a lot of things to me and left the room.

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:49.480
Shaking and crying.

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:53.480
And then I got a text from him that was like, Hey, I'm hanging out with, uh, with, with

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:56.480
Bob, uh, both way across the street or across the, the hall.

01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:57.480
Yeah.

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:02.480
And I wanted to go so badly, but I looked like, uh, an octopus that had been running,

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:03.480
run over.

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.480
It was covered in tears and a big mess.

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:06.480
That's what I do.

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.480
That's how I abuse you.

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:10.480
You're a big piece of shit.

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.480
You're a big piece of shit.

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.480
Hey, Richard Dawson.

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.480
What's up?

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:20.480
I wish you were here.

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:26.480
I'm also embarrassed that you, that you heard our fight.

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:27.480
I don't know.

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.480
Like, I wonder what he heard.

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:36.480
I mean, this was our fight that we had about, um, me offering you a ride and a van and you

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.480
getting upset about that.

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.480
So a lot of, a lot of van talk.

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:43.480
I just do a lot of that.

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.480
You're welcome that I brought you on the tour talk.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:46.480
Right.

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.480
Well, something, because the cycle that you and I get into is when like you feel disrespected

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:54.480
by me and then you go, uh, oh, uh, you, you.

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.480
Pittsburgh too.

01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:56.480
You don't appreciate me.

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.480
And then I go, I don't appreciate you.

01:39:58.480 --> 01:39:59.480
Well, guess what?

01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:00.480
Guess what?

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:01.480
Fuck you.

01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:03.480
I've appreciated you so much.

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.480
You don't even know.

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.480
We have a lot of fun.

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.480
You guys, you have to make it.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:08.480
I let you breathe at night.

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:11.480
I don't strangle you to death.

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:13.480
You're welcome.

01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:16.480
Your throat's just sitting there.

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.480
You won the lottery with me.

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:23.480
An animal would kill you.

01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:29.480
I mean, for, for all your talk of you being an abusive boyfriend, uh, we really are, uh,

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.480
best friends and I'm a crazy person.

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:35.480
I'm not a, you know, it's, it's, it's fine.

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:46.480
I'm saying this to Bob, uh, best friends.

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.480
This feels terrible.

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:53.480
Bob is strangling, Bob is actually strangling his wife over here.

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:57.480
Can we, can we get a spotlight over here?

01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:04.480
I feel, I feel so bad because I have a, I have a podcast about relationships and I get on

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:07.480
my high horse frequently about what's healthy and what's not.

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:12.480
And, and, yeah.

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:15.480
Do you, uh, do you still want to move in with me?

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.480
Yes.

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.480
All right.

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.480
Let's, let's move in together.

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.480
We did it.

01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.480
Wow.

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:23.480
We created a story.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.480
Don't you guys already live together though?

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.480
Basically.

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:29.480
You, you've been to her apartment one time, right?

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.480
I've been, yeah.

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480
Literally he slept over one time.

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.480
Yeah.

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:35.480
That's, that's hard.

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:38.480
Also guys, we have a big announcement.

01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:44.480
We are getting a puppy.

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.480
All right.

01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:50.480
Gross in the mouth.

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:54.480
Gross in the mouth.

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.480
Also, I cut myself.

01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:05.480
I just, I carved Dan into my thighs.

01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:11.480
When you laugh, it makes me think that you kind of think that that could be true, but

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.480
it's not, not remotely, not remotely.

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:15.480
All right.

01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:18.480
Spencer, you got, did you give characters to, wait, you guys, wait.

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.480
I gave characters.

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:20.480
Yeah.

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.480
Come back here.

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.480
No, no, no, no.

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:23.480
No, no.

01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:24.480
Roy, sit on me.

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.480
No, you guys got to sit.

01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:26.480
What?

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.480
You guys.

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.480
You got to stop the stage.

01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.480
Exactly.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.480
Exactly.

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.480
Like the second level mage that you are.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:37.480
Sit like the gods you are at the Egyptian.

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:38.480
All right.

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:41.480
So Spencer, you have a tall task in front of you now.

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:43.480
You've got two more characters in the stage.

01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.480
That's cool.

01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:49.480
If you don't mind, bring us up to date on our campaign.

01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:53.480
Are you going to music?

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:56.480
Not if you're going to be a dick about it.

01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.480
Okay.

01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.480
I have the volume down.

01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.480
Okay.

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:00.480
I'm sorry.

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:01.480
Not possible.

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.480
All right.

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:05.480
Do you want me to distribute the sheets first or at the same time as talking?

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:06.480
I got it, man.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.480
All right.

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:08.480
Well, that one's yours, man.

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:09.480
Do you need anything?

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:12.480
These are, this is your new spell list.

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.480
That's yours.

01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.480
We have our sheets.

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.480
Yeah.

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:16.480
This is the adventure.

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:18.480
This is great podcast talk.

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:22.480
Looks like in the end we're going to fight a war.

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:25.480
Well, you can't read.

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:26.480
It doesn't say that.

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:29.480
All right, Spencer, take it away.

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:35.480
On the last episode, our heroes had been trapped within the deep and mystical magical

01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:38.480
infinifish for what seemed like an eternity.

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.480
Sorry.

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:40.480
Mystical.

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:41.480
Sorry.

01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.480
What?

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:43.480
Mystical chasms.

01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:44.480
Who can't read now?

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.480
This guy.

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:46.480
Right here.

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.480
Who's got a tourney side of die?

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.480
I can't read.

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.480
I can't do math either.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.480
I'm sorry.

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.480
Go ahead.

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.480
Go ahead.

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.480
This is my musical cue this time.

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.480
No, you still got it.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.480
After meeting with a village of fish-willing humans and a master swordsman named Vellicent,

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.480
our heroes found and destroyed various organs in a quest to escape their living prison.

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:10.480
Slipping down a slippery fight, they found a magical tome before coming on to the beast's

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.480
great hearts.

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.480
After a long fight, the gang was on the ropes.

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:17.480
Just when they thought all hope was lost, a long lost ally reappeared.

01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:18.480
Tylenol with Cody.

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:23.480
With the aid of the mystical unicorn, the party was able to destroy the beast's heart.

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:26.480
They defeated the great beast fell out in the sky, crashing to earth.

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:32.480
With a catastrophic crash, a catastrophic crash, and a sickening splat, you feel yourself being

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:36.480
plugged into the wall and all the flesh in the chamber compulses, expanding and trapping

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:38.480
you within its great form.

01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:43.480
You feel your bodies being squeezed, compressed, crushed, grabbed by feedback.

01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.480
And the squelch of liquefying tissues.

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:50.480
Its side bursts open and your party is squirted out in a bolus of fleshy bits, slimy fluids,

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.480
and bloody chunks.

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:56.480
Land unceremoniously in a heap.

01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:57.480
Spencer!

01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.480
Yep.

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:02.480
You were only three seconds over, but that was my fault.

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.480
That was my fault.

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:05.480
Yep.

01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:08.480
That was some real dungeon mastering.

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.480
So are we on the ground?

01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:15.480
You're on the ground in a big pile of each other, and you're swimming in fish fluids.

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:18.480
There's gross sand.

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.480
I don't know.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.480
Oh, more rain.

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.480
Wow.

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.480
You have viscera in your hair.

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.480
Oh, it's embarrassing.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:34.480
Hey, why don't you guys move in together and get a puppy?

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:40.480
Maybe one day we will, little man, when we've finished our journeys and settled down.

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.480
But what are we really questing for?

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:43.480
We've been doing this for so long.

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.480
What is it that we're really going after?

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:47.480
We got swallowed by the Infinifits.

01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:48.480
I know.

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:53.480
And then that way, latest from the task of going to rescue my father, I think.

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.480
Yeah.

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:59.480
So can we still rescue your father, Sharpie?

01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.480
We could.

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:06.480
I mean, I've never liked him, but I've always wanted his approval.

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:12.480
I feel like I got that, so we could let him die.

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.480
Yeah, you guys found closure there, I think?

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:19.480
My fathers are only good for approval after that, like what are they doing?

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:23.480
Their job is done when they come, right?

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.480
In the most technical terms.

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:31.480
They're not mothers, they don't nurse you.

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:37.480
My father taught me how to wear a breastplate and swing a sword.

01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:41.480
Well, maybe we should go hang out with him.

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:44.480
Yeah, I care about him, I guess.

01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:48.480
Well, why don't we explore our surroundings?

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:51.480
You explore your surroundings.

01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:58.480
I should say, after defeating the Great Infinifits, you feel wiser and stronger as a result.

01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.480
What?

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:01.480
Oh, shit.

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:02.480
You level up.

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:05.480
Level up!

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:13.480
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5...

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:18.480
But he's here, but he stayed and he's not going away!

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.480
He might soon.

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:23.480
And now he called him out on his fill obligated, please feel obligated.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:25.480
So are we level three now, Spencer?

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.480
You're level four at this point.

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.480
Poor, holy smoke.

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.480
That is crazy.

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:29.480
Yeah, man.

01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:30.480
Don't we have an animal yet?

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:34.480
As it happens, at level four you gain an animal companion?

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:36.480
Yes, please.

01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.480
What kind of companion do you want?

01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.480
Oh, I didn't know I had to choose.

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:47.480
God, I don't want to be Meg Ryan,

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.480
but what are my options?

01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:51.480
You mean just a couple seconds here.

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:53.480
When Harry met Sally, it doesn't really work

01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:55.480
because she was just refining her order.

01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.480
I'm sorry.

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.480
She's famous for option exploration.

01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:01.480
I don't have what she's having.

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.480
She's very particular.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:05.480
Is there a fox?

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.480
I'm going to shoot off some animals.

01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:09.480
Badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog,

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:12.480
eagle, hawk, horse, owl, pony, snake, wolf.

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.480
I'm a woman, horse.

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:16.480
Okay, horse?

01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:19.480
Horse, so I can ride the horse.

01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:22.480
A horse trots up to you out of nowhere.

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:24.480
What color is it?

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.480
What color do you want it to be?

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:28.480
Your animal companion.

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.480
Really, shit.

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:32.480
It's brown.

01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:34.480
There you go.

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:37.480
It approaches you with a knowing look in its eye.

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.480
It seems to say...

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:41.480
My name is Coco.

01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:43.480
Let's companionate.

01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:45.480
And that too.

01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.480
She can say it all.

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:50.480
Oh, hi, Coco.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.480
We nuzzle.

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.480
You nuzzle.

01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:56.480
I'm so happy.

01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.480
You can leave me here in this viscera.

01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:00.480
I'm done.

01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:02.480
This guy is this world is tinged with purple

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:04.480
and swaying orbs of orange light

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.480
that seem far off, bob and weave,

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.480
slightly in the twilight expanse of the sky.

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.480
Large trees cover all you can see

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:12.480
aside from the massive bulk of the affina fish

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:15.480
whose body is decimated a wide swath of trees

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.480
that it must have fell upon.

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.480
The body of the fish stretches upwards

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:21.480
about 20 feet higher than even the tallest of the trees.

01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.480
The split in its side is massive

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.480
and seems to be a mortal wound.

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:27.480
The body is iridescent and blotchy,

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.480
and it seems more like an eel than a true fish.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.480
You can see the occasional twitcher

01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:33.480
stir ripple across its mass.

01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:35.480
The body stretches onward in both directions.

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:37.480
What's happening? What am I not seeing?

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:39.480
As far as you can see,

01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:41.480
and almost certainly firing,

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.480
this wilderness landscape is very foreign to you

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:45.480
and must be on another planet or plane

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:47.480
or something along those lines.

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:49.480
From far off, you can hear the occasional roar

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:51.480
and screech of beasts,

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.480
but then you hear shouting from far off

01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:55.480
and the sounds of branches and twigs breaking.

01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.480
Two people are approaching quickly.

01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.480
Two people.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:01.480
Who goes there?

01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:03.480
I have sharpie Buttsalot.

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.480
I'm done talking.

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.480
I'm Mulraine Sedona.

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.480
I have arrows, and I shoot them.

01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:11.480
They might be friends.

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:13.480
That's true.

01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.480
But we're playing this game of presenting ourselves.

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:17.480
Oh, you weren't shooting the arrows at them.

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:19.480
No, no, I was just saying I have arrows.

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:21.480
That was a brief introduction.

01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:23.480
What the hell did you do to our infinifish?

01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:25.480
You killed our infinifish!

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.480
That was our infinifish!

01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:29.480
Oh, shit!

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.480
We've raised him since he was a finifish.

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.480
Since he was a finifish.

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:39.480
Done talking, babe?

01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:43.480
We were stuck inside him,

01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:45.480
and we couldn't get out.

01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.480
Wait, this is your infinifish?

01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:49.480
Not a your infinifish,

01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:51.480
but an infinifish.

01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.480
You raised the infinifish.

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.480
Your infinifish was swallowing people.

01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:57.480
Yeah, but we were stuck where we are now,

01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:59.480
and that's the only way we could get out.

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:01.480
We were transported to a place by a wizard

01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:03.480
who ended up dying and left us here.

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.480
The infinifish was our only way out.

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:07.480
Who are you? What are you?

01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:09.480
I'm a rogue.

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:11.480
Did you guys come up with names?

01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:13.480
I got your names right here.

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:15.480
The pair introduces themselves.

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:17.480
The larger one is a half orc,

01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:19.480
perhaps wearing heavy armor.

01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:21.480
Definitely wearing heavy armor.

01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:23.480
Sean pointed at Roy when he said the larger one.

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:25.480
Yeah, he's the half orc.

01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:27.480
We determined it randomly.

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:29.480
With a dice roll.

01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:31.480
Sean is the half orc.

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:33.480
Yeah, a half orc battle cleric

01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:35.480
by the name of Slab Squatthrust.

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:37.480
Wait, that's Roy or Sean?

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.480
That's Roy.

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:41.480
Sean goes by the name of Stumpjunkman.

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.480
Stumpjunkman.

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:50.480
Also a star of Gonzo porn.

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:53.480
It's a Mystery Science Theater 3,000 reference.

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:55.480
Alright.

01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:57.480
I apologize.

01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:59.480
Well, you guys are standing.

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.480
Wait, so you guys raised a giant

01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:05.480
people devouring fish

01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:07.480
to get off of this planet?

01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:09.480
Or their liars.

01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:11.480
Because there were people inside that fish

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:13.480
that were stuck there forever.

01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:15.480
I think they might have been improvising.

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:17.480
We didn't care about them.

01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:19.480
Our fish was the only way

01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:21.480
that we could get out from where we were.

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:23.480
It's unfortunate that it swallowed you.

01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:25.480
I do apologize for that.

01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:27.480
But defend yourselves. You killed our fish.

01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:29.480
They're going to fight us!

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:31.480
Combat!

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:33.480
I have arrows!

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:35.480
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:37.480
I'm a coward.

01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:39.480
I have gotten this far

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.480
avoiding

01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:43.480
all harm.

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:45.480
Don't sell yourself short.

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:47.480
Over the course of this journey, you have changed.

01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:49.480
You've become stronger.

01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:51.480
And don't you have a hawk?

01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:53.480
Hawk!

01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:55.480
Attack their faces!

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.480
No, no, I'm kidding.

01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:59.480
I think that they're

01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:01.480
wanting to attack us.

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:03.480
They're bad.

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:05.480
You guys want to attack?

01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.480
I'm saying to them,

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:09.480
let's not fight.

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.480
Ask them.

01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:13.480
Audience, do you want something to happen?

01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:15.480
I command.

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:17.480
You like us.

01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.480
We like you?

01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.480
Oh, yeah. Casting his arms

01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:23.480
about in a magical manner.

01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:25.480
He casts the spell command while uttering the command

01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:27.480
like.

01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:29.480
Pick a target, Roy.

01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:31.480
That's one of them threes.

01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:33.480
Thank you.

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:35.480
Pick a target.

01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:37.480
Cast it on

01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:39.480
Sharpie.

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:41.480
Sharpie, you feel compelled to like this person.

01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.480
I mean, I already did.

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:45.480
Which is weird, because he's the one that wants to attack you.

01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.480
I don't want to attack!

01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:49.480
I don't want to attack!

01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:51.480
There you go. He's liking you.

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:53.480
How does that make you feel?

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:55.480
Probably liked.

01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:57.480
This guy's alright.

01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:59.480
Gentlemen,

01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:01.480
are you wishing to destroy us?

01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:03.480
I'm sorry

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:05.480
that we're talking about this for so long.

01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:07.480
Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:09.480
So you like us?

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:11.480
I'm still unclear.

01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:13.480
I'm a rope scoundrel.

01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:15.480
So if you like my friend

01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:17.480
by proxy, I like you.

01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:19.480
Alright.

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:21.480
What's

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:23.480
anything fun to do on this planet?

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:25.480
You guys have a camp nearby

01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.480
that you've been staying at.

01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:29.480
Let's go check out that camp!

01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:31.480
We check out the camp.

01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:33.480
I love it. Love this guy over here.

01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:35.480
You only liked him a couple seconds ago.

01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:37.480
It's gone to love.

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:39.480
Did he cast Duncan Trussell on you?

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:45.480
40 years old,

01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:47.480
clock's ticking.

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:49.480
Likes kind of turned to love faster than it did when I was 25.

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:51.480
Alright, we run out to that camp.

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:53.480
Do you guys want to take him to your camp?

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:55.480
Just to be sure.

01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:57.480
We will take him to our camp.

01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:59.480
I'm not my horse.

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:01.480
I hold her name.

01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:03.480
Upon the horse you ride.

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.480
Everyone loves it.

01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:09.480
Soon you're at a small camp.

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:11.480
The large green canvas tents are pitched

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:13.480
and a fire pit has been dug

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:15.480
with skewered hunks of meat roasting over the flames.

01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:17.480
A few rocks have been shaped into comfortable-looking chairs.

01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:19.480
This is our camp.

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:21.480
Our camp is your camp.

01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:23.480
Welcome here.

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:25.480
I sit comfortably in one of the rock chairs.

01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:27.480
Nice.

01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:29.480
Would you like some of the meat that we have grilling over

01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:31.480
is a really gross thing.

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:33.480
Help yourself.

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:35.480
This has been a weird day.

01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:37.480
I have to say,

01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:39.480
you guys are handling the murder of your pet pretty well.

01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:43.480
So are you two together?

01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:45.480
Or is there a...

01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:47.480
Yeah, what's your story?

01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:49.480
Are there partners for us to meet?

01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:51.480
Is there a Mrs. Stop Frump?

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.480
Our relationship is strictly plutonic.

01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:57.480
For all intents and purposes.

01:55:57.480 --> 01:55:59.480
Is there anyone else on this camp?

01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:01.480
He said plutonic.

01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:03.480
That means super gay.

01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:05.480
That's right.

01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:07.480
It's all the way up the bud.

01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:13.480
Shout out to Penny.

01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:15.480
He needs to say plutonic.

01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:17.480
I've told you that a million times.

01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:19.480
They're adorable.

01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:21.480
I like these guys.

01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:23.480
You guys made all this furniture?

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:25.480
He stands at a new finish.

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:27.480
When you finish it, right?

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.480
We bought it from Ikea.

01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:31.480
It's beautiful.

01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:33.480
Tell us.

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:37.480
Every person and creature in this land

01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:39.480
wants something.

01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:41.480
What do you too long for?

01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.480
In what way is your life compass?

01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:45.480
I'm so afraid to hear this.

01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:47.480
Before we get into that,

01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.480
I want to extend the use of

01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:51.480
our cleaning area

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:53.480
since you have plenty of fish guts all over you.

01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:55.480
Clean yourself and then we will talk.

01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:57.480
There's a little hot tub over here.

01:56:57.480 --> 01:56:59.480
Thank you.

01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:01.480
I kind of like the shimmer of the fish viscous.

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:03.480
I'm going to keep it on for a little while.

01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:05.480
I create water.

01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:07.480
Nice.

01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:09.480
What?

01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:11.480
Everyone does.

01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:13.480
It's nothing to brag about.

01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:15.480
That's not a competition.

01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:19.480
And good arrows.

01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:21.480
Fellows, where are we?

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:23.480
Do we know where we are?

01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:25.480
We're on an alien planet.

01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:27.480
I feel like they're hiding something.

01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:29.480
This camp looks like it must have cost

01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:31.480
to eat you $1,000.

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:33.480
What do you guys want out of this?

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:35.480
Spencer, I creep off.

01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:37.480
I hide behind Coco.

01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:39.480
They think that I'm brushing Coco

01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:41.480
and then I just inch away

01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:43.480
and I poke around.

01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:45.480
Do I find anything?

01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:47.480
You find a dire badger.

01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:49.480
Cool.

01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:51.480
Lips pulled back

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.480
and teeth bared.

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:55.480
It charges.

01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:57.480
I use my power

01:57:57.480 --> 01:57:59.480
to talk to the animal.

01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:01.480
You don't know that's happening.

01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:03.480
She snuck away.

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:05.480
I was talking about a squirrel I saw there.

01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:07.480
A squirrel approaches.

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:09.480
I take out one sleep arrow

01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:11.480
and I fire it at the badger.

01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:13.480
You fire it at the badger.

01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:15.480
It's biting you in the leg.

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:17.480
You take three damage,

01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:19.480
but you strike the badger

01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:21.480
with the arrow and it falls asleep.

01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:25.480
Still three damage, though.

01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:27.480
What the hell is going on over there?

01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:29.480
Hey guys, I come limping back.

01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:31.480
I'm sleeping badger

01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:33.480
clenched to your legs.

01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:35.480
Sometimes I fancy myself a detective.

01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:39.480
I stirred up a badger,

01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:41.480
but gentlemen,

01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:43.480
quirk, sharpie,

01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:45.480
these men have a dire badger.

01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:47.480
What kind of people

01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:49.480
have dire badgers?

01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:51.480
They live in an alien dimension.

01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:53.480
We can't ask you because a spell

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:55.480
is cast on you.

01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:57.480
I like them.

01:58:57.480 --> 01:58:59.480
I cast a level one cause fear

01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:01.480
on

01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:03.480
Moraine.

01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:05.480
Titled to Will Save.

01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:07.480
That just means I'm afraid?

01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:09.480
Yeah, you run screaming.

01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:11.480
Ah!

01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:13.480
I'm sorry about her, guys.

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:15.480
That's, uh,

01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:17.480
that time of the harvest.

01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:21.480
Why don't you go talk to Bob

01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:23.480
and go hang out, have him show

01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:25.480
you his trailer.

01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:27.480
I'll cry in the room.

01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:29.480
Ah!

01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:31.480
I said that as a joke, I'm sorry.

01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:33.480
You're spilling vodka all over your hair.

01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:35.480
You're spilling vodka all over.

01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:37.480
That's not how it works.

01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:39.480
Those are brand new sheets.

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:41.480
Clumsy. I know, I'm sorry, Spencer.

01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:43.480
I apologize for a badger attacking you.

01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:45.480
Much like us,

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:47.480
it's stranded here in an unfamiliar

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:49.480
realm.

01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:51.480
We are just trying to find our way back home.

01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:53.480
What is your home?

01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:55.480
I don't feel comfortable disclosing that information

01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:57.480
with you.

01:59:57.480 --> 01:59:59.480
I know I just screamed and ran away,

01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:01.480
but I do not trust these guys.

02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:03.480
I like them.

02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:05.480
What?

02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:07.480
Spencer, am I

02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:09.480
in the area?

02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:11.480
Um, let's see.

02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:13.480
Yeah, you recover from your panic

02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:15.480
and start to wander back.

02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:17.480
I ask, uh,

02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:19.480
I ask, uh, Slab,

02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:21.480
I said, you know, man, it's been a long fight

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:23.480
in that infinite fish. I could really use a nice back rub.

02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:25.480
Jeff likes

02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:27.480
a settlement.

02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:29.480
I cast hold person.

02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:35.480
Whoa!

02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:37.480
You fail your save.

02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:39.480
You're stricken.

02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:41.480
You can't move. You feel yourself being held

02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:43.480
as a person.

02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:45.480
In a tender way?

02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:47.480
In a sleep paralysis way.

02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:49.480
I go to sleep?

02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:51.480
No, I guess more of just a regular

02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:53.480
paralysis way.

02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:55.480
I,

02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:57.480
Spencer, I don't trust you too.

02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:59.480
You want to fight them?

02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:01.480
Yeah.

02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:03.480
Yeah, I do.

02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:05.480
Yeah, I take

02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:07.480
two arrows.

02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:09.480
The arrows,

02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:11.480
I fire them,

02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:13.480
and I, me and Coco scream,

02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:15.480
adventure!

02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:17.480
I'm fighting it.

02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:19.480
Fire at them.

02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:21.480
Both of your arrows miss their mark

02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:23.480
and plant themselves deep within the earth.

02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:25.480
It's fine because I have Coco.

02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:27.480
So, you're trying to hurt us, are you?

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:29.480
No.

02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:31.480
This whole thing has become

02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:33.480
like an Andy Dick party.

02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:35.480
This is a weird random,

02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:37.480
people are pitching YouTube commercials.

02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:39.480
I inflict

02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:41.480
moderate wounds.

02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:43.480
Alright, on who?

02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:45.480
Malray. Oh, damn.

02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:47.480
Reaching out towards you,

02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:49.480
he attempts to touch you with his crackling

02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:51.480
with energy hand. Typical.

02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:53.480
Very.

02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:55.480
Was it moderate wounds, he say?

02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:57.480
Yeah.

02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:59.480
Just making sure I got the right spell,

02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:01.480
that's all you guys, don't worry about it.

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.480
He touches you lightly

02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:05.480
on the arm, but you feel intense pain.

02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:07.480
Do something.

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:09.480
Spread throughout your entire body.

02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:11.480
You take 12 damage.

02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:13.480
Hey, take it easy, buddy.

02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:15.480
I like you.

02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:17.480
What are you doing?

02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:19.480
You're burning my woman.

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:21.480
I'm so just...

02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:23.480
Kill your buzz on that.

02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:25.480
You're not liking him as much as you were.

02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:27.480
You guys are getting creepy on us.

02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:31.480
Okay, I cure moderate wounds.

02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:33.480
This guy is

02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:35.480
all over the shop.

02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:37.480
I like that, he's just good.

02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:39.480
He gave me the world's creepiest back rub.

02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:41.480
Now he's fucking fighting people, curing them.

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:43.480
He's like Cleverbot.

02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:45.480
This is random.

02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:47.480
Are you off your medication?

02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:49.480
I love everyone.

02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:51.480
This guy is showing it.

02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:53.480
Mulraine is healed to full health.

02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:55.480
Jesus.

02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:57.480
I apologize for my friend

02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:59.480
and my traveling partner.

02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:01.480
As a sign of good faith,

02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:03.480
please take one of my two healing potions.

02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:05.480
I'll see.

02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:07.480
Really?

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:09.480
Fine.

02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:11.480
Dude.

02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:13.480
I'll take it, but also dumb.

02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:15.480
You have two, should have given two.

02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:17.480
With you constantly attacking,

02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:19.480
I set their lives on fire.

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:23.480
Their lives?

02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:25.480
They're just handing us potions.

02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:27.480
I'm just sitting around a fire.

02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:31.480
Everybody's lost their minds.

02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:33.480
That's the worst thing.

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:35.480
I'm just trying to open up and get a back rub

02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:37.480
and everyone's just going to fucking gun shitty.

02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:39.480
People are doing poppers.

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.480
I tell everybody about my independent movie

02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:45.480
that I'm going to make and how great it's going to be

02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:47.480
but I take it,

02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:49.480
I take my sword

02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:53.480
and I

02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:55.480
I try to hit their throats.

02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:57.480
Jesus Christ.

02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:59.480
Their meat is no harm.

02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:01.480
They're not doing anything.

02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:03.480
I don't trust them.

02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:05.480
Holy fuck.

02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:07.480
So is that happening?

02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:09.480
Guys, she's not with us.

02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.480
You're paralyzed, Court.

02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:13.480
Yeah.

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:15.480
I'm telling you, they try to hurt me.

02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:17.480
There's this badger.

02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:19.480
I try to slice your throat.

02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:21.480
Pick a throat to slice.

02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:23.480
Slabs.

02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:25.480
Slab, what's your AC?

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:27.480
It should be around 20.

02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:29.480
Now I feel bad about this.

02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:31.480
You can do it.

02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:33.480
Can I use a vision?

02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:35.480
You slice your foot open.

02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:37.480
You're not rolling high tonight.

02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:39.480
I'm sorry.

02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:41.480
Just three damage.

02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:43.480
That's not bad.

02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:45.480
You look really embarrassed.

02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:47.480
You know, things happen.

02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:49.480
It doesn't even seem like an act of aggression.

02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:51.480
It just seems like a very

02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:53.480
confusing and desperate maneuver.

02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:55.480
I'm a woman.

02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:57.480
I do things.

02:04:57.480 --> 02:04:59.480
I care her light wounds.

02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:01.480
You care to full health.

02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:03.480
I punch myself

02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:05.480
on the head three times.

02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:07.480
You do that.

02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:09.480
You regain control of your body

02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:11.480
and just enough to punch yourself.

02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:13.480
I eat a tree.

02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:17.480
I fuck the sleeping badger.

02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:19.480
It wakes up.

02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:21.480
I use my power

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:23.480
to talk to the badger.

02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:25.480
I pull the badger aside

02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:27.480
behind one of the roughly

02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:29.480
human attractive stone chairs

02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:31.480
and I go, what the fuck is going on?

02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:35.480
Spencer horses are intuitive, right?

02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:37.480
They can tell if someone's a good person

02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:39.480
or a bad person.

02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:41.480
I'd say so.

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:43.480
I go up to Coco and I say,

02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:45.480
Coco baby.

02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:47.480
What's the deal with these two fellows?

02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:49.480
Are they good or are they bad?

02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:51.480
Spencer, what are we just looking at?

02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:53.480
What are we just looking for?

02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:55.480
I can explain it in a second.

02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:57.480
You just say defer to me.

02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:59.480
Let me take care of these two actions.

02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:01.480
The badger's like, hey man, this is like forest land.

02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:03.480
I don't know what it's called because I'm a badger.

02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:05.480
But it's like a forest.

02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:07.480
This whole thing is all forest.

02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:09.480
All I've seen is forest.

02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:11.480
Do you know these guys?

02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:13.480
No, I don't hang out with humans.

02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:15.480
I live with my animal friends

02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:17.480
and sometimes we

02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:19.480
cavort and play but we don't talk

02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:21.480
to people unless they can talk to animals.

02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:23.480
Which is odd.

02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:25.480
I'm going to hang out with you. These guys are freaking me out.

02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:27.480
Cut to the horse.

02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:29.480
These guys are obviously

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:31.480
very confused.

02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:33.480
They're not in their element.

02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:35.480
They aren't from here.

02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:37.480
But Coco baby,

02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:39.480
are they evil?

02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:41.480
I can't say if they're evil.

02:06:41.480 --> 02:06:43.480
They don't seem evil but they do seem

02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:45.480
jumping and afraid.

02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:47.480
Easily agitatable.

02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:49.480
Whatever you say is perfect.

02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:51.480
Cut to the two adventurers

02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:53.480
whose camp you're in

02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:55.480
starting a lengthy monologue.

02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:57.480
Maybe not so lengthy.

02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:59.480
What would hope?

02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:01.480
We've been searching

02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:03.480
for this thing.

02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:05.480
It's called the soul of growth.

02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:07.480
The soul of growth is what birthed

02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:09.480
the world tree and the world tree

02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:11.480
created the entire plane of

02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:13.480
vibrance.

02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:15.480
From that came the material plane

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:17.480
and all the plant life in it.

02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:19.480
It's a very powerful thing.

02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:21.480
It's supposed to be here.

02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:23.480
Like I said before, that wizard dude

02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:25.480
he teleported us here

02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:27.480
but he got eaten by a dire wolverine.

02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:29.480
Are you saying this?

02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:31.480
These guys are saying it.

02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:33.480
I'm not looking at it written down

02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:35.480
but I have it written down somewhere.

02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:37.480
So I command Sharpie

02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:39.480
to help us find the

02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:41.480
whatever the hell it is.

02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:43.480
You're going to have to cut it down to a one word answer.

02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:45.480
A one word command.

02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:47.480
Like help.

02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:49.480
Of course.

02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:51.480
Well it fails to affect him unfortunately.

02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:53.480
Damn it.

02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:55.480
You are told to help but you don't necessarily

02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:57.480
look compelled to.

02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:59.480
What kind of game are you trying to run on me man?

02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:01.480
Can I use my skill of diplomacy

02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:03.480
to try to aid,

02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:05.480
have them aid us in our quest?

02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:07.480
Is your skill of explain a seed?

02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:09.480
Yeah man.

02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:11.480
Okay.

02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:13.480
The soul of growth. Just explained it.

02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:15.480
Looking for it.

02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:17.480
We got trapped on this plane.

02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:19.480
Now we don't know where the fuck to go.

02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:21.480
Let's go find the soul of growth.

02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:23.480
We would appreciate your help and in turn

02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:25.480
thank you on whatever quest we're on.

02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:27.480
We'd love to. Remember that crazy girl

02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:29.480
who looked just like me who was trying to kill you?

02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:31.480
She was the worst. She left.

02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:33.480
I'm here.

02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:35.480
I give bull strength to Mulraine.

02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:37.480
Oh.

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:39.480
Whoa.

02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:41.480
What does that mean?

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:43.480
Your strength increases by five.

02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:45.480
Thank you. Thank you Roy.

02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:47.480
You're welcome.

02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:49.480
Shout out to Panner.

02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:51.480
That's right.

02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:53.480
I jump on my horse.

02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:55.480
Actually, I'm just getting penny if you listen to this.

02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:57.480
That's a joke.

02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:59.480
Can I inquire as to what your quest is?

02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:01.480
What are you doing out here?

02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:03.480
I'm just hanging out with these two fuckers.

02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:05.480
Things have gone pretty wild for a while.

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:07.480
We want adventure

02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:09.480
and fortune, right?

02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:11.480
Also my dad is getting killed.

02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:15.480
I like the sound of the soul of growth thing.

02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:17.480
It sounds like maybe we're going to find

02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:19.480
something bigger than just

02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:21.480
fortune.

02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:23.480
Maybe our souls can

02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:25.480
prosper through this. We can grow as people.

02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:27.480
Sounds great.

02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:29.480
Gentlemen, new friends, would you like to ride

02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:31.480
on my horse with me?

02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:33.480
Yeah.

02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:35.480
Come on. Coco.

02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:37.480
This doesn't look a good idea.

02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:39.480
I'm really afraid of...

02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:45.480
Horses.

02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:49.480
Is everybody on fucking mushrooms up here?

02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:51.480
I thought it was just me.

02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:53.480
You know, he has a talking dagger.

02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:55.480
That's true.

02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:57.480
I have a talking dagger.

02:09:57.480 --> 02:09:59.480
What's up?

02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:01.480
Are you interested in that?

02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:03.480
Not yet.

02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:05.480
Are you sure?

02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:07.480
Yeah.

02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:09.480
What?

02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:11.480
What's going to steal your talking?

02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:13.480
The world's worst murder mystery.

02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:15.480
I'm Madame McCray

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:17.480
and I run New Orleans.

02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:21.480
You run New Orleans?

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:23.480
No, I run New Orleans.

02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:25.480
Let's get some more ice.

02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:27.480
I'm pretty sure these guys are going to

02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:29.480
try to rape and kill us in the road to the soul of growth.

02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:31.480
That's true.

02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:33.480
I caught a divine favor on...

02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:37.480
It's quark. We can be on first names.

02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:39.480
Quark.

02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:41.480
You are granted a divine favor

02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:43.480
and you get the sense that if you attacked something

02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:45.480
you'd do a better job of it

02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:47.480
as if you had the favor of the divine gods.

02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:51.480
That's right.

02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:53.480
He's just going down and she's like...

02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:55.480
Casting everything.

02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:57.480
If you are a fucking wizard, you do that shit too.

02:10:57.480 --> 02:10:59.480
I am a wizard.

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:01.480
Well then do that. It's fun.

02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:03.480
Well, fine. I...

02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:05.480
Help him know I'm out over here.

02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:07.480
I cast...

02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:09.480
I get to inflict a whole

02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:11.480
shitload of wounds on you guys.

02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:13.480
I cast Mage Hand.

02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:15.480
You get the ability to teleport her.

02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:17.480
I mean, I'm sorry.

02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:19.480
Move light objects.

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.480
Yeah, sir. I use it to lift a rock.

02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:23.480
Oh, shit.

02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:25.480
Oh, uh...

02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:27.480
Yeah.

02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:29.480
Okay, now I...

02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:31.480
I cast Ray of Frost on the rock.

02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:33.480
It is covered in a thin sheet of ice.

02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:35.480
No!

02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:37.480
Yeah!

02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:39.480
Now I cast Burning Hands on the frozen rock.

02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:43.480
It cracks in half.

02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:47.480
Let's fucking do this shit, bro!

02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:51.480
The powers you've demonstrated

02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:53.480
can aid us on our quest, please.

02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:55.480
I used them.

02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:57.480
I had to recharge.

02:11:57.480 --> 02:11:59.480
I use stone...

02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:01.480
I use stone shape to make it a puppy.

02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:05.480
The stone chair

02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:07.480
shapes ships into the shape of an adorable puppy.

02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:11.480
I cast Hypnotism on the puppy.

02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:15.480
The puppy, though shaped like a stone.

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:17.480
I mean, though shaped like a puppy,

02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:19.480
is but a stone.

02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:21.480
I take two arrows and shoot them at the necks of the strangers

02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:23.480
because I realize I don't trust them.

02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:27.480
Jesus Christ, you cannot...

02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:29.480
one of them strikes directly into the throat.

02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:31.480
Pick guys, are you doing each?

02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:33.480
I don't...

02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:35.480
How many times have they healed you now?

02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:39.480
It's like you don't want to be loved.

02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:43.480
But they're not open about who they are.

02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:45.480
It's disconcerting.

02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:47.480
We're so open to answer who we are.

02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:49.480
You just told them you were somebody else earlier

02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:51.480
when you were behaving like an asshole

02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:53.480
and then shot them in the neck with an arrow.

02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:55.480
That was not me.

02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:57.480
I use my skill of listen to hear what Mulraine has to say.

02:12:57.480 --> 02:12:59.480
Damn.

02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:01.480
I use my...

02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:03.480
He's glad.

02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:07.480
I use level 3 to cure serious wounds.

02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:09.480
You'll cure your neck wound.

02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:11.480
I cast Jump.

02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:13.480
I'm going to jump just up in the air like Jack Nicholson

02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:15.480
and Wolf.

02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:17.480
James Spader just like jump around.

02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:19.480
I was going to jump around.

02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:21.480
I eat 14 arrows.

02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:23.480
You get indigestion.

02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:27.480
I march off alone in search of the soul of growth.

02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:29.480
I would like to tag along with Warwick

02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:31.480
and explore the warwick.

02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:33.480
I join him.

02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:35.480
Anybody that wants to come along can come.

02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:37.480
But let's fucking set some ground rules here.

02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:39.480
I'm going with that guy.

02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:41.480
Let's be friends and let's fight.

02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:43.480
Let's fucking put your dick back in your pants

02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:45.480
or take it out.

02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:47.480
Don't create water all over each other.

02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:49.480
You're a bunch of fucking nutjumps.

02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:51.480
Fucking nutjumps.

02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:53.480
I've been standing around here

02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:55.480
and it's fucking crazy.

02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:57.480
I'm leaving.

02:13:57.480 --> 02:13:59.480
You guys stay here and fucking punch each other

02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:01.480
and kiss each other and freeze rocks.

02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:03.480
I join him.

02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:05.480
I'm trying to grow as a person.

02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:07.480
I join him in magic investment.

02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:09.480
Nice.

02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:11.480
Thank you. I'll take it later.

02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:13.480
As you leave, you feel your armor grow stronger.

02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:15.480
I appreciate that.

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:17.480
Whatever your name is, I'm leaving.

02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:19.480
Trot, trot, trot, trot, trot, trot, trot, trot.

02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:21.480
Trot, trot, trot, trot, trot.

02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:23.480
I go running behind Quark.

02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:25.480
Come on.

02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:27.480
Do you guys want to go east-west or south?

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:29.480
East or west or along the side of the fish

02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:31.480
and south is away from him.

02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:33.480
South.

02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:35.480
All right, that's a good direction.

02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:37.480
Everybody's coming?

02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:39.480
I really could have used 10 minutes alone, but fine.

02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:41.480
Cliffhanger!

02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:43.480
Cliffhanger!

02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:45.480
That's the end of it.

02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:47.480
That's all we have.

02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:49.480
Come on, everybody.

02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:51.480
Holy moly.

02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:53.480
First-time D&D players, guys.

02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:55.480
Hey, we all are.

02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:57.480
I don't think they did anything wrong.

02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:59.480
That was terrific.

02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:01.480
I enjoyed myself, and that's what matters.

02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:03.480
We had a...

02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:05.480
It's not like I've ever had an expert D&D player.

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:07.480
It's not like...

02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:09.480
What would that be like?

02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:11.480
That was great.

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:13.480
It was like going to the weirdest

02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:15.480
bisexual bar in the middle of nowhere.

02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:17.480
It was like so many encounters

02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:19.480
we had on the road, remember?

02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:21.480
I could go to like Rhode Island,

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:23.480
and then somebody would buy you a drink, and you didn't know.

02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:25.480
Yeah.

02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:27.480
There was like no encounters that I had on the road.

02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:29.480
Where were you, Jeff?

02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:31.480
I was alone.

02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:33.480
After every show, Dan stood out there.

02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:35.480
I say this only so that you have to do it tonight as well.

02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:37.480
Dan stood and signed everybody's shit

02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:39.480
after the show.

02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:41.480
But this is too big a crowd.

02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:43.480
You can't do it tonight.

02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:45.480
I don't need you there in Los Angeles,

02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:47.480
but I would do it anyway.

02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:49.480
I'm very proud of the fact that...

02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:51.480
I'm not proud of myself for shaking

02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:53.480
everyone's hand and signing their shit.

02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:55.480
That would be a dumb thing to be proud of,

02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:57.480
because it's not an accomplishment.

02:15:57.480 --> 02:15:59.480
I'm like, oh boy, that's so hard.

02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:01.480
It's like digging a ditch.

02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:03.480
But you showed great interest in that.

02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:05.480
You became very fascinated.

02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:07.480
What I was proud of is the fact that I didn't...

02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:09.480
My instinct wasn't to go, go fuck yourself.

02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:11.480
I'm tired.

02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:13.480
I had Milwaukee and a motorcycle

02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:15.480
a rider had his horrible wreck

02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:17.480
and his leg flew off.

02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:19.480
I was running down to him and I tripped over his leg

02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:21.480
and I was like, oh shit, his leg's gone.

02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:23.480
I was proud of the fact that I didn't like...

02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:25.480
I would always think on paper if you said,

02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:27.480
oh, you're going to interact

02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:29.480
with a guy who lost his leg,

02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:31.480
that I would go, oh, I'll probably faint

02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:33.480
and I won't be able to help him.

02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:35.480
And I didn't help him. He died.

02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:37.480
Do you want...

02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:39.480
Do you want truth

02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:41.480
or do you want a story?

02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:45.480
We want a story.

02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:47.480
I want a true story, preferably.

02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:49.480
He died a million years later.

02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:51.480
He lived a full life.

02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:53.480
He had eight children.

02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:57.480
He didn't die there in the sidewalk,

02:16:57.480 --> 02:16:59.480
but I found out later that he died.

02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:01.480
But the point is that I didn't

02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:03.480
faint and become useless.

02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:05.480
I said, hey man, you okay?

02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:07.480
Called 911

02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:09.480
and put a blanket under his head

02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:11.480
because that's what heroes do.

02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:15.480
I would say on the road, Dan and I

02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:17.480
were both kind of concerned in the beginning

02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:19.480
that we would go off on the road

02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:21.480
and leave our little nest that melt down comics

02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:23.480
and wonder whether or not the crowds that would come

02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:25.480
and see us in Phoenix or Austin

02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:27.480
or Nashville or wherever would get it

02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:29.480
or dig it or whatever.

02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:31.480
What we found out was that it was really safe

02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:33.480
but it's for me, I'm so happy

02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:35.480
to be back and just go back

02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:37.480
and to melt down comics and our

02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:39.480
50 loyalists that come in there

02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:41.480
every time. The cool thing about being back

02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:43.480
this is the one thing that I learned.

02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:45.480
I don't know if I changed, but

02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:47.480
the thing that

02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:49.480
us sitting in the back of a comic book store

02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:51.480
we're doing the show. We're going to keep doing that every week

02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:53.480
because that's like therapy for me.

02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:55.480
50 people show up.

02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:57.480
Weird thing to cheer,

02:17:57.480 --> 02:17:59.480
and I also don't want to punish you for cheering.

02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:01.480
I just

02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:03.480
want to make you self-conscious about it.

02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:05.480
The

02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:07.480
obviously keep doing that.

02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:09.480
I was always happy to do that, but

02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:11.480
there was a voice in the back of my head going

02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:13.480
oh, is this, are you

02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:15.480
regressing

02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:17.480
into a cradle of comfort that's ever

02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:19.480
diminishing? Is your world getting

02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:21.480
smaller and smaller

02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:23.480
by sitting in the back doing this bear sat

02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:25.480
spaulding gray routine?

02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:27.480
Are you just like shrinking

02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:29.480
shrinking and shrinking into

02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:31.480
a less and less of a person and just talking

02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:33.480
to the only people left that will ever listen

02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:35.480
to you? So that

02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:37.480
I think that urge is like get out there

02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:39.480
go try this

02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:41.480
bullshit in Phoenix and see if it plays

02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:43.480
see if someone throws pudding at your face

02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:45.480
and then

02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:47.480
all this shit was like Pat Oswald came up

02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:49.480
and he warned us very justifiably

02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:51.480
he was like holy shit you're going to Phoenix

02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:53.480
it's going to be all fucked up.

02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:55.480
The podcast culture is such

02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:57.480
that what's happened is like

02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:59.480
in every city in the

02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:01.480
entire world like you can find

02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:03.480
like a hundred or more

02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:05.480
of the people

02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:07.480
that you would want to hang out with there is

02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:09.480
so every city that we went to

02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:11.480
it was all the same. It was really odd

02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:13.480
they weren't like wearing different hats like

02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:15.480
I'm from Austin so it's a cowboy hat

02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:17.480
like it wasn't they were just the same people

02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:19.480
I'm not saying it should be kiss ass or

02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:21.480
you know like to blow smoke but it was

02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:23.480
amazing and really

02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:25.480
reassuring was that the people that we meet

02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:27.480
are the same people that we fell in love with

02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:29.480
here for our show

02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:31.480
is that incredibly creative

02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:33.480
people come to the show like people get like

02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:35.480
just like all the artwork

02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:37.480
and the gifts and the conversation

02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:39.480
they make you a napkin or a hat

02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:41.480
napkins not that part of it

02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:43.480
it's a very

02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:45.480
like it's a very cool like powerfully creative

02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:47.480
they're all writers there's got to be more writers

02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:49.480
per capita

02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:51.480
in a Harmontown audience than anything

02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:53.480
how many writers are out there

02:19:57.480 --> 02:19:59.480
they're not a group of people that likes to

02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:01.480
applaud themselves

02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:03.480
but we'll

02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:05.480
go with cockroach rules and assume that means

02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:07.480
most of you

02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:09.480
there's 50 people clap so there's

02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:11.480
150 writers out there

02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:13.480
for everyone you see Jeff and they're born

02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:15.480
pregnant

02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:19.480
but the cool

02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:21.480
thing is coming back I feel like

02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:23.480
doing those shows in the back of Meltdown

02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:25.480
where we're going to continue to do them

02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:27.480
I do feel like okay

02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:29.480
having gone to like 20 cities in 23

02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:31.480
days what we learned is

02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:33.480
it's not necessarily

02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:35.480
an unhealthy thing I'm doing like I am

02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:37.480
talking to people

02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:39.480
that are all out

02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:41.480
there and everybody

02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:43.480
that came up to me and talked to me at all

02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:45.480
of these shows they all had that

02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:47.480
thing in common it was like

02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:49.480
little little

02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:51.480
nerds that like

02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:53.480
we don't fit in

02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:55.480
and we just like but

02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:57.480
there's nerds that turn that

02:20:57.480 --> 02:20:59.480
into anger and go like

02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:01.480
we'll fucking kill

02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:03.480
and murder everybody because I'm a nerd

02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:05.480
and I'm gonna fucking strangle them and show them what's what

02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:07.480
and then there's nerds that are like

02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:09.480
ah god damn it I just want

02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:11.480
people to like me I just want to

02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:13.480
and I want to like them I want to understand them

02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:15.480
all these lines

02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:17.480
like 5,000 people

02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:19.480
I think I probably

02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:21.480
shook hands with and talked to and it was all

02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:23.480
the same some of them can't make eye contact

02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:25.480
and most of them can't make eye contact

02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:27.480
and I can't make eye contact

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:31.480
I know you get this all the time

02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:33.480
it's just really like

02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:35.480
I really like it

02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:37.480
you don't have to tell me that I'm just Dan Harmon

02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:41.480
can I get a picture? I don't know

02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:43.480
I didn't mean to

02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:45.480
your fault I don't know

02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:49.480
I had this conversation with Spencer on the bus

02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:51.480
and the camera crews weren't there

02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:53.480
the director will blow his brains out when he hears about this

02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:55.480
everyone was sleeping

02:21:55.480 --> 02:21:57.480
the camera crew was sleeping

02:21:57.480 --> 02:21:59.480
it was the most important scene in the documentary that'll never be seen

02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:01.480
everyone was sleeping

02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:03.480
everyone in the aliens ship

02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:05.480
was in hyper sleep

02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:07.480
and I woke up mysteriously

02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:09.480
the bus wasn't moving

02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:11.480
the oil was getting changed

02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:13.480
and I walked out and we were in the middle of the space station

02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:15.480
and I walked

02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:17.480
randomly into this little thing

02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:19.480
and Spencer was sitting there looking

02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:21.480
unexpectedly like perfectly

02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:23.480
at home in a truck stop when you actually look at him

02:22:23.480 --> 02:22:25.480
he looks like

02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:27.480
if you saw him in a truck stop you would not

02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:29.480
you would not look twice

02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:31.480
little do you know, yeah

02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:33.480
and Spencer and I just talked for a while

02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:35.480
and we talked

02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:37.480
about autographs, we talked about pictures

02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:39.480
we talked about weird things

02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:41.480
Spencer is half my age

02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:43.480
I thought it was a very interesting conversation

02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:45.480
because you and I were talking to each other

02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:47.480
about

02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:49.480
why do people put

02:22:49.480 --> 02:22:51.480
importance on these things

02:22:51.480 --> 02:22:53.480
like what is it about autographs

02:22:53.480 --> 02:22:55.480
souvenirs, photographs, all these rituals that we engage in

02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:57.480
that they celebrate specialness

02:22:57.480 --> 02:22:59.480
oh shit, Bill Murray is in an elevator

02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:01.480
I get a lack of his hair

02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:03.480
I'll have him sign a thing or I'll say something shitty to him

02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:05.480
so I have a story to tell my friends

02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:07.480
I had the urge to make this moment special

02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:09.480
and I was explaining

02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:11.480
to you, well I think

02:23:11.480 --> 02:23:13.480
people, yeah that's what we have this urge

02:23:13.480 --> 02:23:15.480
to make this moment special

02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:17.480
and I feel like you, I don't want to put words in your mouth

02:23:17.480 --> 02:23:19.480
but at one point you were like

02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:21.480
so you want to understand them

02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:23.480
like about normal people

02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:25.480
you were like

02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:27.480
so you actually

02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:29.480
want to know

02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:31.480
how they think

02:23:31.480 --> 02:23:33.480
and I was like

02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:35.480
I'm obsessed with that

02:23:35.480 --> 02:23:37.480
like I think that

02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:39.480
when you don't fit

02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:41.480
in like you can react one of

02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:43.480
two different ways to that

02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:45.480
and I had that conversation with you

02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:47.480
and I don't know

02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:49.480
I know it was important but I have no idea

02:23:49.480 --> 02:23:51.480
what the final verdict was or anything like that

02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:53.480
and I know that you were affected by this journey

02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:55.480
and I

02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:57.480
I hope the movie is good

02:23:57.480 --> 02:23:59.480
and I hope that me babbling

02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:01.480
will create some kind of

02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:03.480
good

02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:05.480
yeah

02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:09.480
I hope I can improvise

02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:11.480
the ending of the movie

02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:13.480
also I think I was told

02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:15.480
there's going to be some visuals to go along with it too

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:17.480
oh damn

02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:19.480
I'm supposed to point at the projectionist

02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:23.480
oh shit

02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:25.480
we're not even

02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:27.480
going to be performing let's just watch

02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:29.480
I mean dad you can sing along

02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:31.480
and they can rap too

02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:41.480
