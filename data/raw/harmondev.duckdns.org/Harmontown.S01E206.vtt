last night\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:54.000\nDid I\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:56.000\nOn Friday\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:57.000\nThe Trump ad\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nIs it his own people that made that?\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:01.000\nThe one that has the statistics\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:04.000\n46 minutes of speech\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:09.000\n22 minutes of applause\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:10.000\nIt was like\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:14.000\nIt was like stats about how great his speech went\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:15.000\nIt was so weird\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:17.000\nHe's a 16 year old girl\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nGoing like\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:23.000\n3 pounds of birthday cake\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\n3 candles per\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nSquare inch of frosting\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:30.000\nIt's your birthday you dumb fuck\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:31.000\nIt's what happens\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nNo one has to love you in order for that to happen\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:34.000\nYou know Dan\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nYou're going to have a fucking Republican convention\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:37.000\nTalking about being president\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:39.000\nThe only alternative is a Democrat\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:41.000\nThey're there to cheer you\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:42.000\nDip shit\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:46.000\nThat doesn't mean you did something right\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:51.000\nI think you come down on Trump a little too hard sometimes\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:52.000\nLet the man have a chance\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:54.000\nLet him talk\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:55.000\nLet him talk\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:01.000\nHe took the Washington Post's press credentials away\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nYou can't follow me around anymore\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:05.000\nBecause you always say mean things\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:07.000\nThat's the newspaper\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:10.000\nThey're totally anti-Trump\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\nEvery headline is like\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:13.000\nHe's a piece of shit\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:14.000\nAnd here's why\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nBut he is a piece of shit\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:17.000\nAnd then also\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nBecause he complained about it\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:19.000\nThey said\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.000\nWhy don't you come in\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:23.000\nBecause he kept talking about how they edit the articles\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nOr they misrepresent things\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:26.000\nSo they brought him in\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\nAnd just sat him down\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nAnd they published the entire transcript\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:30.000\nThen he's\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:31.000\nGuess what\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nHe's a fucking dumbass\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:36.000\nLike it was like a three hour transcript of them\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:37.000\nJust going like\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nLike what do you think of Nixon\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:40.000\nNixon was great\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:41.000\nNixon was good\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:42.000\nHe made some mistakes\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:43.000\nBut Nixon was a president\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:46.000\nHe was a huge president\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:48.000\nOkay what about Abe Lincoln\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:49.000\nAbe Lincoln\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nAbe you know\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nGreat great president\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:56.000\nTruly great president\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nAlright\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nBut you guys can hear about all about that\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.000\nHe's gonna win\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nI got a fucking feeling\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nHe's gonna win\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:06.000\nI'm not a pessimist\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:07.000\nI don't want him to\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nI just feel like\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.000\nWe didn't think he was gonna get this far\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:13.000\nAnd he's gonna ride that wave\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nAll the way into the beach\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nWhich is us all dying\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nOr will he ride a Russian conspiracy\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nTo get him elected into the beach\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nWhat's the deal with that man\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nWhat the fuck are you talking about\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nWe hear that the Russians are the hackers\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:31.000\nThat leaked all this DNC shit\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nIt's pretty crazy man\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:35.000\nAnd WikiLeaks loves Milo Yiannopoulos\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:36.000\nAll of a sudden\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nSome crazy world shit man\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nSo there's this gay guy\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nHe's like a republican gay guy\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:43.000\nI'm gonna stop you right there\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\nI'm gonna stop you there\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nHe's like a pro Trump guy\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nSo the campuses are turning\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:53.000\nLike there's little Trump heads\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nOn the campuses\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nBecause how else are you gonna rebel now\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:01.000\nThey just want to worry people\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nThat's their job, they're young\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:08.000\nAnd they're really fond of this guy\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nI mean this is them cracking the code\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nOr rather the code is cracking them\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nBecause they love a gay guy\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nLike we win\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nThere's a certain respect\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nThat's all we wanted\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:25.000\nLike they can see that this guy is gay\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nAnd also a human being that they love\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:28.000\nBut they love him\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:29.000\nBecause he says all kinds of fucked up shit\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:30.000\nAnd if you complain back\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nThen you're homophobic\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:37.000\nIt's pretty, it's kind of fun\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:41.000\nWe're all six years old\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nIt's easy to follow politics now\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:46.000\nBecause it's like just\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:49.000\nTabitha hit someone with a toy truck\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:52.000\nLike it's not that hard to\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:53.000\nLike you used to have to know\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nWhat a majority whip was\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nI couldn't get through one episode\n\n05:58.000 --> 05:59.000\nOf House of Cards\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nI'm like I don't know what the fuck a whip is\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nStop telling me about the whip\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nHow can a show where the guy talks\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:10.000\nTo the camera be this confusing\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.000\nDan Harmon really\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nThat was me, I was the worst Kevin Spacey\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nI just started watching that\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nIt's a good show\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nWell Jeff I'm glad you like that show\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:30.000\nI'm not glad Jeff likes that show\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nBut if I tell him I am\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nWell in about two terms\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nHe'll flip like a labradoodle\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.000\nAt an Othello party\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:44.000\nOh Dan Harmon\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:49.000\nI'm about to do the Harmon on Dan\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nAlright well let's bring out our new friend\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nI mean really she should be an old friend\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nI'm sure she is to many of you\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nShe played maybe on Arrested Development\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nThe rest of her resume is like\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:05.000\nShe clearly, she's probably\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nSomeone hip enough to not mind being called hip\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nShe's definitely a presence in the hip\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nThe hip pocket of comedy\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:16.000\nShe's deputy chief of staff on Trump's campaign\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nBut I ran into her at the up front\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nThe Turner cable up front\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nSo let's make friends with her\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:40.000\nShaw Cat is here\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nI just had this crazy panic as I was introducing you\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nBecause I thought\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nHave I only seen her name in print\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nHave I ever said it out loud in front of her\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nSay it again to me but like in my eyes\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nAlia Shaw Cat\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nIt's pretty close\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nI say Alia\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:57.000\nAlia\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nYou can say Alia\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nThat's the first time I went Alia\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nYeah it's okay\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nSo there is a panic struck with a lot of people\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:04.000\nYeah\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nIs this a boa thing you have going on?\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nIs this part of the top?\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nNo it's detachable\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:10.000\nOh yeah\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nI'm hip\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nI'm really hip\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nYeah you know it's hot\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nBut sometimes you get a little cold around the neck\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:21.000\nI'm gonna make myself a\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nStraight up vodka drink if that's okay\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:24.000\nYeah yeah\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nYou're not getting any flak from the\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nElmo for industry people are you?\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nNo me and Elmo had a thing so\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:34.000\nIs that what color Elmo is?\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.000\nShe's wearing a fur thing for those of you\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nListening in audio\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.000\nAlright some of these people don't understand\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nI'm wearing Elmo around my neck\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:44.000\nAlright so\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nLet's talk about when I was\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nAt Turner\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:49.000\nYou were\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nWhat a weird thing that was by the way right?\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nYeah well what's really weird is how funny\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nConan O'Brien, Anderson Cooper\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nAnd Charles Barkley are as a\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nThree man comedy team\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nLike they really tore the place up\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nIt was great cause like\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nConan O'Brien and Charles Barkley\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nStarted doing these basketball jokes\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nAbout yeah well I'm taller than you\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nBarkley was just shooting stuff off the hip\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nNo pun intended I mean he was just like\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nHe's funny he's actually\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nHe was really funny\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nStraight up funny\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nBut then right on schedule Anderson Cooper\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nRight as I was thinking like the same thing\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nExcept because I'm a nerd like Anderson Cooper\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nSaid guys I'm gay I've been like\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nMy eyes glazed over\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nFive sports jokes ago\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nAnd it was really funny\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nI did a great job retelling his joke\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nOh you're not gay so it's a little different effect\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nNo it was such a strange thing that\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nThey had a drone\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nOn a leash\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nThat was like hovering\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nTrying to get away\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nAnd Wolf Blitzer was just kind of\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nStaring at it like what's happening\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nAnd it was so odd and I was sitting\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nIn the front row and I felt like this\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nWeird prom queen to an event\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nI had no attachment to cause it's like\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nIt's mainly for promoters right so like\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nI mean not promoters advertisement\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nSo it's like people from all over the country\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nSelling stuff for these networks\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nAnd they're like pushing\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nTurner you know so they're like\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nWe make you know 18 to 24\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nAnd like all these percentages\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nAnd these like weird power point presentations\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nAnd fireworks\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nI took a picture of one thing it was like\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nWolf Blitzer standing in front of a big screen\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nThat said like your brand\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nPlus\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nTurner's Reach equals\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nYeah it was like\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nIt was like we're announcing the election\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nResults now cause that was part of what they were selling\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nThat was the creepy part\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nDid you feel creeped out by the fact that\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nThey kept insisting\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nThat this election was going to be a squeaker\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nThe same way the NFL would\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nAssure you that this Super Bowl is going to be\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nIs going to be packed\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nPeople are going to be glued to their sets\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nAnd it's like ugh I'm so uncomfortable with that\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nYou're already state run\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nTelevision like you're already just this\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nOne tube that people get all their information through\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nIt's the state of our country that we're talking about\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nIt's like crazy obviously it's going to have\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nHigher ratings but to be like\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nYou better watch our country fall apart it's going to be crazy\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nLike stay tuned\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nThat way\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nBecause you guess who can\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nThey can they can definitely put their\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nThumb on the scale especially\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nIf like the whole point is for\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nNo thumb to be on there like a thumb weighs a lot\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nIn journalism\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nLike Al Jazeera is probably like I don't know\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nJust watch cause it's the world\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nYou know what I mean like stay tuned cause that's what's happening\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nAnd they're like no we're going to make this fun\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nYeah it's very\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nVery disturbing\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nAll the news organizations just keep boasting about\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nRatings during these debates\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nAnd things like that and it's just like\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nIt really is depressing\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nYeah they definitely didn't\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nThere was some 9-11 footage\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nLike cause it was like\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nWe're always there CNN's always there\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nIt was like friends\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nYou know what I mean they're like remember friends huge hit\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\n9-11 also a big hit\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nTwo big hits\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nWell three\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nTwo and a half big hits\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nI think one of those hits wasn't really a hit at all\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nYeah\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nOh are you one of those?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nYou think the reptilians did it?\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nI think one of those hits was\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nPlanted detonators\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nOn the eye beams of those\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nThere's no black box found\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nWhat about\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nBuilding 7? How come?\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nIt was funny too that\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nSorry we can't move up but they said something about\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nThey're doing another apprentice\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nSeason\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nAnd Donald Trump is producing it\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nAnd I was like is this whole thing just to like\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nYes\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nJust to get more people to watch the apprentice\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nOf course it is\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nHe's already won if he doesn't win the presidency\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nHe's already won\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nHe's the most famous person in the world right now\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nHe might be the most famous person of all time\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nLike you can't go anywhere in the world\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nWhere he's not a punchline or a setup or a thing\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nI like to imagine it's like men in black\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nLike underneath it\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nAnd there's this tiny little dying alien\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nWho's actually running the body\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nThat was the worst thing\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nWe at Comic Con\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nAre the co-creator of Rick and Morty\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nJustin Roiland and his friends Alex Hirsch\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nAnd I can never remember the third guy's name\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nBecause I don't want to get it wrong\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nIs this the guy you work with?\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nNo\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nThey had a party on this yacht\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nAnd they just\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nWhy not invite everyone from Game of Thrones\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nAnd every fucker showed up\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nEvery single goddamn throne\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nEver in the game\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nLike\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nI didn't know that was going to happen\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nThis party was on an old\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nLike 1929 yacht\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.000\nLike a three deck old\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nLike Rockefeller's yacht kind of looking thing\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nFrom the old days\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nAnd our nerd comedy\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nAnd animator friends hanging out\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nAnd I'm around the bend and I see a guy\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nThat I recognize and I go oh my god\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nAnd I just put my hand out and he goes hi\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nAnd it's Sam Well right\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nThe chubby guy from Game of Thrones\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nBooks and protects the baby\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nAnd kills the white walker with the thing\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nAnd I go oh I don't know his name\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nI'm like oh my god I love you on the show\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nAnd he goes thank you that's really nice\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nAnd they turn the corner\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nI go to the bar\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nRamsay Bolton\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nThat was the most freaked out one\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nAre you a Game of Thrones person?\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nNo I'm not\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nYou're an incredible sport\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nThat's pretty great\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nCrazy\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nI mean aren't there like 32 cast members\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nAll that shit?\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nYeah and on all their names\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nAre like Yaman Yaman Yubin Yubin\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nYou know they're not\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nNo one's like Mike Steele Dick\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nLike so that you can just remember\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nIt's like Dinklage and that's it\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nLike everybody else is like Yermin Sherman\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nGerms\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nActually that would be easy to remember\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nYermin Sherman Germs\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nBut I was gonna say the tough thing was\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nBecause you know they're fancy\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nThey're an HBO show\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nThey're from the most watched thing ever\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nThey're like nerd royalty\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nAnd like it was just sad\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nCause all I wanted to ask was\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nWhat's it like to be so fucking\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nCrazy famous right now\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nWhich is an answer they can either\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nTheir answer's gonna be the weirdest\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nThe most distorted\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nAnd they're gonna be the most sick of answering that question\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nSo it's like pointless to ask that\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nBut it's really all I can think of to act\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nI can't think of\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nIt's fucking crazy\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nIt's a mindblower\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nMy life has changed forever\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nYeah and it's like what would that even mean\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nYeah I'd go like okay I don't know why\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nSo I don't know why I do that\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nI think it's just good when I'm like really into\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nSomeone like I'm a fan of someone\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nInstead of like trying to interact with them\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nSo they actually know who I am\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nI just like to like get stoned with them\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nOr you know get like in an environment\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nWhere we get a little drunk or something\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nGreat good\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nBut just to like kind of like\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nChange reality where it's like\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nOh this person that I'm used to seeing talk\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nI get to see in this like alternate\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nLike I don't know that's the only best\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nTake away I can get from it\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nBecause any time I try to like connect with someone I'm a fan of\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nNever works\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nWell there's all that pressure it's like\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nOh how can I fuck this up\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nWhich is something you should never be thinking\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nWhen you're talking to someone\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nBecause that's like that's something that\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nImagine you did that when you ordered coffee\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nYeah\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nDid it wait today?\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nI just want to finish my one thought\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nSo you don't think that I have to do these weird segues\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nBecause I would hate for you to think that\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nIt's already happening\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nThis thing runs like a swisk\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nThat's why they call them Dan\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nStay on target Herman\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nBut I just wanted to connect those dots\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nThe bummer was that\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nIn the midst of all of that\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nHumility and fanboyishness\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nThat I was feeling like\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nThe other thing for them to talk about was\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nLike so like Trump\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nYou know and it's like I don't want\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nI don't want Sir Davos\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nHaving to worry about that shit\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nBut it is something for him to worry\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nAbout\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nHe's got to worry about his fingers\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nHe's got to worry about all sorts of things\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nHe had ten fingers and he\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nIn the show does he have like nine or something\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nThe crazy thing was they just finished\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nShooting so they all have the same haircut\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nLike they all\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nBut they're wearing his J.Crew shirts\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nBut it's like a little bit of\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nProducts you know\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nExcept for there's you probably\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nThe show is ubiquitous enough that you\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nAre you familiar with the image of\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nVaris the bald eunuch\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nLike he's kind of portly\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nI feel like I am now\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nWhere he's like a big robe\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nMaybe even in memes\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nYou would have encountered this image\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nOf this guy like he's the master\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nOf gossip and\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nSabotage and subterfuge\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nAnd relies on apparently a network\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nOf underage children to\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nI don't know\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nWow this show goes deep\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nAnd he can teleport sometimes but\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nWhat\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nYeah that dude goes\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nI'll be right back and he's on\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nHe's across the entire planet\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nBut anyways he was\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nSuffice it to say the guy is\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nHe's like\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nHe has three things about him\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nThat make him recognizable\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nHe was the one guy because he had\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nIt was Tan Varis with like a full head\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nOf hair so he wasn't getting\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nFucked with at all he didn't have to\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nAnswer any of my dumbass questions\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nHe probably was sad about that\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nHe's got it made man\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nThat's what you want you want to play\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nA character that has an eye patch\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nSo that you can detach yourself\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nTotally\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nYou were super young when you were\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nYeah I mean\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nI was 14 and I did the pilot\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nWhat was your acting\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\n14\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nHubba hubba\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nYou grew up in Palm Springs\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nI just researched\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nLike so were you\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nNot so many cheers for that huh\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nSherman's Deli\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nYeah that's all I have\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nAnd your dad was an actor so\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nNo so my grandfather was an actor\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nAlright Wikipedia\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nIt hasn't been updated\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nNo my dad so my grandfather\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nWas an actor and like\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nWas born in New Orleans and like had a career\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nIn Hollywood in like the 50's and 60's\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nHe was in like Thomas Crown Affair\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nAnd Valley of the Dolls\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nAnd then he did a TV\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nShow called Naked City\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nIn 12 o'clock high\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nAnd then he kind of got like blacklisted\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nBecause he like slept with a British model\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nWhose husband was like a studio guy\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nI don't know there's something that happened\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nYou know towards the end but\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nMy mom was like raised in Hollywood\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nAnd then my dad\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nIs from Baghdad, Baghdad dad\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nBaghdad dad\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nHe had a whole bag of dads there\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nA whole bag of dads, I just picked one\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nAnd so he\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nCame over in the 70's\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nLike $200 in his pocket\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nAnd his family\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nOwns a lot of the big strip clubs\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nIn Hollywood like Seventh Veil\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nThe Body Shop girls girls girls\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nYeah so\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nHe was a bar back\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nSeventh Veil was the first one\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nBecause he was trying to still convince himself\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nHe was like it's not at all\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nIt's classy and it's cultural\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nI don't think they're worried about that\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nBut my mom\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nWas like a law school dropout\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nAnd so she got a job as a waitress\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nAt the Body Shop\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nAnd they met and\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nFell in love\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nAnd then decided to open up their own business\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nIn Palm Springs because my grandfather\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nHad a weekend home in Palm Springs\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nHe retired because all the actors in the 60's did\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nAnd so then they moved there\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nAnd opened up their own strip club\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nAnd uh\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nThis is so romantic as long as they're still together\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nThey are still together and the strip club is still going\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nAnd uh\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nThat's called show girls\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:49.000\nIt's a cathedral city\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nI have to imagine there was some sort of mafia connection\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nNot your family but if you're going to open up\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nA strip club in Palm Springs\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nThe mob is involved right\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nYou know what I mean\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nThere was just like a lot of them\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nUh\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\nThey're Arabic\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nThey have gold chains\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nThey're gamblers\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nWe went to Vegas every weekend\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nA lot of my childhood\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nSo it was very like anything you need\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nIt had the same persona\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nBut I don't think they were like\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nKilling people\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nSometimes one of the clubs would burn down\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nThat kind of thing\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nThat's what I'm talking about\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nBut my dad is very like\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nThe straightest arrow of the bunch\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nLike he's very conservative\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nSo in Palm Springs\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nThis one would be run like a tight ship\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nNo more burning\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nNo more burning\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nHe's a very honest business man\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nYeah\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nWe have a friend Chris Romano\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nThis is all public record\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nHe said it on TV\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nHe's told the story on the podcast\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nHis name is Chris Romano\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nHe couldn't be more Italian\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nA little\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nSounds like a horrible debate\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nHe's short\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nBut he's so Italian\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nAnd so charming\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nAnd he was always\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nHis partner Eric Faulkner from Boston\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nSo he's got this Boston accent\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nAnd he's just like, uh, Chris Romano\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nLadies can't resist me\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nAlso, to know him for 15 minutes\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nYou've seen his dick twice\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nThat guy's dick is out\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nHe's very open\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nHe lowers the bar of\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nGo to channel101.com and watch Shit Buster\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nYou'll know everything you need to know\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nSo he finds out\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nIn his adulthood\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nLike way into being a whole human being\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nHe finds out that\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nRomano was this\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:51.000\nLike, you know, who\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nQuickly chosen\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nWitness protection program name\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nThat I think his dad picked\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nAnd he was a Lebanese arsonist\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nOh my god\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nSo this quintessential Boston\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nItalian kid\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nAll of a sudden you're like\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nOh, you're Lebanese\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nHe was doing a drunk history\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nAnd he was going to talk about\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nThe Red Sox winning the World Series\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nAnd he got so drunk\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nDerek Waters kept getting him drunker\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nAnd drunker, and drunker\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nAnd finally he couldn't get past Game 1\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nHe couldn't get to Game 2\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nHe lost all train of thought\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\nAnd he goes, I'm so sorry\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nYou know my dad was the most famous arsonist\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nIn Massachusetts\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nAnd he's in the\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:39.000\nWitness, they were in the Witness\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:41.000\nLocation program\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nAnd I run into\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\nChris Romano in the baby\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nToy section at a Toys R Us\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nDon't ask why I was there\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nHe has a baby, I was just there being\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nA competitor\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nBut he told this thing, I got so drunk\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nI told the story, he was like\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nA lot of the people I talk about are still alive\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nThey're in jail\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nBecause his dad would\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nThose are the dots I was connecting\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nMob, Middle Eastern\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nAnd\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nThe arson business\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nMy dad will be so happy\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nBecause I guess he was just a guy\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nYou hired, he was like a fire bug\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nYou know, you just like, for insurance\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nThere's a guy that you actually get\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nThat specializes in setting the fires\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nLike an air braleota\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nIt was a movie, guys\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nIt was in a burning building\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nThe reason we ran into each other\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nAt that weird up front was\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nBecause you were in something\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nThat's rolling out, are you only acting in that?\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nI'm producing it too\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nAnd it's\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nWhat's it called?\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nA search party\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nIs it airing yet?\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nNo, it comes out in November\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nOn TBS\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nBut they dropped the very funny, so it's just TBS\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nWhen I first found out I was like\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nTBS, very funny\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nWe're not doing that anymore\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nThe only bad thing about the history channel\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nWas that right before I started doing a show on it\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nThey had decided\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nThat they were rebranding\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nJust the word history\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nInteresting\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nYou have to catch yourself\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nI'm on the history\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nAsk any of these guys\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nI made it through the transgender revolution\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nWithout a hitch\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nI wove through those cones\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nLike a fucking\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:31.000\nGreased shark\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nLike a greased shark\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nGoing through cones\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nBut\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nThat doesn't conjure up alacrity\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nThey weren't attached to the seaport\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nThey weren't floating\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nThe history thing really\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nThrough me\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nIt's the history channel\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nEvery time you want to make a joke\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nWithin the show\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nThe history channel people are here\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nThey correct you\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nThey're the most\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nLacy fair, like chilled\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nNon-channel\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nIn the world\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nIn history\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nBut\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nIt would just come through\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nIt was an edict that trickled down to\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nMy set\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nIt was usually levy\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nYou gotta say history instead of history channel\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:21.000\nFucking dick\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nHe's crying\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nHe's laughing\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nBut\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nI could\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.000\nWhatever\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nIt's a show\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nThe show is\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nIt's a group of friends\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nWho are kind of reuniting\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nIn the wake of one of their friends'\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nDisappearances, right?\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nYeah, they're like friends\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nThey're kind of like not the best people\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nMy character's kind of a wallflower\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\nShe doesn't know what she wants\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.000\nMillennial sort\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\nAnd then a girl from college\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\nShe went to school with it\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nShe didn't know well at all\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nIn front of Finder\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nShe's not the right person for the job\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nBut she becomes obsessed with it\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nI describe it as a hipster Colombo\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nYeah\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nThat's got my number\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nJohn Early's in it\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nIt's just based on anything in reality?\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nNo, the creators of the show\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nSarah Violet-Bliss\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nAnd Charles Rogers\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nHave weird mysteries in their family\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nBut\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nThat's all I'll tell you\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nSo they kind of were inspired by that\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nLike having a mystery\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nAnd if something happened\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nLike someone went missing in our lives right now\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nLike what would we do?\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nWhat are the tools we actually have to find somebody?\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nBut it's not really based on anything\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nBut now, whether it's because I did the show or not\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nI noticed so many missing\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nPoster things\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nBefore the show, I was like, people don't go missing anymore\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nI mean, they do, I guess, but I just wasn't aware of it\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nBut now there's so many posters\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nWhere people are like, college\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nI've been kind of collecting them in a weird way\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nTo validate my career, I think\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nYou just never saw it\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nYou're now seeing them\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nYeah, I'm just noticing them everywhere\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nAnd that's like when the pilot starts\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nIt's a lot of me doing this\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nJust like staring off\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nInto the distance, like looking confused\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nThat's like 90% of the show\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nSo this is a pilot you shot\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nOr it's been picked up for series?\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nWe shot a whole first season\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nCongratulations\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nWe assume if it's a\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nIf it's a ratings bonanza\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nThen at the end of it, you'll have the extra scene\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nThat you shot where she goes\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nLike, you know what, I love solving mysteries\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nYeah, exactly\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nAnd then I'm like, if you love solving them too\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nPress A\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nAnd then it's an interactive show\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nIs it something you do, continue to do?\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nYeah, I mean, I always have\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nLike a little, not to be like, oh, I'm scared of TV\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nBut TV shows go on for like\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nSo fucking long, it's kind of insane\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nSo like, I'm not going to be like\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nI'd love to do it for the next decade of my life\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nBut I definitely like to do like\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nYeah, three seasons, I don't know\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nYeah, you'll, you'll\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nI want to do it again\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:03.000\nI mean, this is just the old curmudgeon in me\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nI'm just like shaking my cane at you and going like\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nOh, you'll get a taste of ones that don't last very long\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nYes\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nBut the production was like, I canceled\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nI've done like two shows that were great\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nBut they've only gone for two or three seasons\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nSo like, it's nice when they're kind of in that thing\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nBut I don't know what tomorrow is, so I'm okay\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nI mean, everything I work on fucking lasts forever, too\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:24.000\nCause my fucking shit, gold\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.000\nIt's gold\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:31.000\nI love the new season of acceptable TV, by the way\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:34.000\nI've never failed in anything\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:40.000\nGod damn it, fuck you\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:41.000\nNot you\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nNo, it says fuck you on your phone\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.000\nYeah, yeah, so I'm telling you to go fuck yourself\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nOh, you just, you did animals\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.000\nWhat did you do, first season or second season?\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nOh, I did the first season\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nI was a rat\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nYeah, I think, I think I may have\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\nDid they show that one at Starburn's\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nMy animation studio?\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nI saw it\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nIs that yours?\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nI saw it at like a\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nThe rap party\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:08.000\nYeah\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:09.000\nAt the bar, were you invited to that?\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nI, you know, it's like\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nIt's really touch and go with these guys\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nPhil and Mike, cause I can't\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nI can't, I just\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nI just\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nI just go random now\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nI just say\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nHey Phil, hey Mike, and like half the time I\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:26.000\nI nail it\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nOh, right, like you don't know which one's which\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nDid they look alike, right?\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nI mean, they're Jewish, is that?\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nI thought it was\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nCan we have one show where this\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nConversation doesn't happen\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nI know the difference, but I was like\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nIn a room with them, you know what I mean\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nI know I've been there\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nI have an office in the same building as them\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nI can go like inspect their faces\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:49.000\nIt's about how much you want to know\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:50.000\nI've watched YouTube videos\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:51.000\nAnd I've frozen the frame\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:54.000\nAnd I'm like, like someone have a different ear lobe\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nSomeone do something\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:57.000\nI think they dress differently\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nThat's what I noticed\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nMaybe you have racial recognition\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nI have, I'm pretty, you know\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nI like to fall back on the face-blind\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nPhrase, but a lot of people say\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nI'm just a prick\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nBut, but, but\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nI think what it is is that your\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nYour brain is battling for glucose\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nThe different, the different sections\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nOf it when you're developing\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nSo if catching a frisbee\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nLike, like makes\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nLike your brain think\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nThis guy's jam is frisbee\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nThat's going to lead to more of him\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nIn the DNA strain\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nSo you need to play frisbee with everybody, you know\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nSo we need to send more resources\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nTo the part of your brain that catches and throws frisbees\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nLike, but you need those early successes\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nTo trigger those board meetings, you know\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nAnd I think like recognizing\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nTelling the difference between two people\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nWho are mocking you\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nIt only makes it worse\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nTo humanize them, you know\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nI just, I just, I just\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nI just consider it obviously to like remember people\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nBut at the same time I'm like\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nWho gives a shit? There's so many people\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nAt least I don't know who you are\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nYeah, exactly\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nI think it's fun\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nI remember I met Ryan Gosling once\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nRyan, you're here\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nBut, I met him very briefly\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nBut when I met him\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nI was like, hi, I'm Alia\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nAnd he was like, Alia, so nice to meet you\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nAlia, and I was like\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nHe's either a Scientologist or just like\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nWorks really hard at remembering people's names\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nAnd then I ran into him another time\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nAnd I was like, there's no fucking way\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nRyan Gosling can remember who I am\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nAnd he was like, Alia, right?\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nAnd I was just like, this is why you're a movie star\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nEverybody, he's working so hard\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nHe's also a crime fighter\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nWe've learned on this show\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nOne of our very good friends\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nDaniel Gillies has this story\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nWe have to drag it out of him because he's one of these\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nHigh roady, fancy pants\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nHe's a real life hero\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nRyan's just a friend\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nHe's a wonderful person\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nHe's a New Zealand actor who\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nSaw news of Katrina happening\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nAnd just went, I gotta go down there\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nAnd help, like without\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nNo designs on anybody knowing about it\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nAnd then in the story\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nYou have to drag it out of him\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nBecause he knows how it sounds for it\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nBut the story is that\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nSo he called Ryan Gosling his good friend\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nAnd Ryan was like, I'm already\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nOn my way\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nRyan's like getting out of bed\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nHe's like, I'm already on my way\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nThe thing is, hook me a flight\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nThe part of the story that he leaves out is that\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nRyan was already in New Orleans because he was there\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nLike shooting?\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nDestroying the levee\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nSo he's the first one on the scene\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nRight?\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nI mean\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nI mean, it's clever\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nBut\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nJust focus\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nJust act well\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nJust be a good movie star too\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nYou have to rig the game like this\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nI'm sure you're a wonderful performer\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nOur expectations aren't that high of him\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nAlright, well speaking of celebrities\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nAnd the culture of them\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nI think it's time to bring out\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nOur San Diego Comic Con correspondent\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nRyan Ridley\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nHello\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nHave we spoken to Spencer at all yet?\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nHave we even said hi to Spencer?\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nOh, hi Spencer\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nHey Spencer\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nI say hi to Spencer three times a day\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nSpencer's mic doesn't seem to be on\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nSpencer's doing a bit\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nThis is called mute protest\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nSpencer, before we get to Ryan Ridley\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nDid you enjoy your Comic Con experience?\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nOh, it was great\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nEvery year it's great\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nI walked 16 miles on Saturday\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nFriday\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nSaturday\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\n16 miles\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nFinally, take it up with the health app\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nThat's what it told me\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nThat's good, that's a lot\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nNo, it's bad, it's terrible\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nMy feet are like irons that are hot\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nHot iron\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nAre you getting blisters?\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nOh, I get blisters, I have something\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nI don't know if they're corns or bunions\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nOr who knows what, but they\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nManifest at Comic Con\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nBoy, I tell you what\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nI wonder if it's any different\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nIn either direction because of your\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nSomewhat famous\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nWebbed feet\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nOh, it's exactly because of my\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nSomewhat famous webbed feet\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nNo, I have skin\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nIt does weird stuff sometimes\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nThat's probably why my feet are\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nWebbed, it's all connected\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nOnly two toes of my feet are webbed\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nYeah, but it would\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nI'm not like a fish man\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nFish don't have\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nFacial hair\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nCatfish kind of do\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nOh, yeah\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nThat they do\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nI feel like an idiot now\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nAlso, there's the bearded clam\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nI like how you settled back into\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nYour scene, you're like, bearded clam\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nI'm just saying some fish\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nHave facial hair\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nUm, well\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\nRidley, did you\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nWere you in San Diego, Alia?\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nNo, I wasn't this year\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nA film I did called The Final Girls\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nWhich, thanks, yeah\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nIt's a really fun movie that nobody\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nSaw because they didn't know how to\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nProvote it\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nHe is, I know that guy\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nHe's a great guy\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nSo him and Todd\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nOh, look at you\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nHe's doing a dance\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nHe takes a lot of pride in that\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nBut they were doing some kind of\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nHe's been doing this strange promotion\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nFor the film, like doing midnight screens\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nAnd stuff, and he did something\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nAt Comic Con this year where he had an ice cream truck\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nCalled Ice Cream for Ice Cream\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nSomething like that\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nWhere they were trying to promote it\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nStill, and Thomas was there\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\nAnd Angela Trimber, it was something\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nObviously, it wasn't enough to get me to go\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nWhat's the conceit\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nThe conceit\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.000\nAnd then I want you to perform\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nThe key scene\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nI wanted to know what the movie's about\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nBut I wanted you to think I went to Harvard\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nYeah, I did it\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nIt's about\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nThese kids who go see\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nA movie that the main girl's mom\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nWas in, it's like an 80's horror movie\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nAnd then they get sucked into the movie\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nAnd they have to escape\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nLast action hero with the horror genre\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nTotally, it's a really fun romp\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nNice Ridley\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nThank you Spencer\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nThis is why he's the subcomptroller\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nDid you also go to Harvard?\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nsubcomptroller?\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nJeff is the controller\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nAnd I've sub-perimacationally\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nYou see, it's helpful\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nThere's a whole dynamic, I don't know\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nPlan B\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nAlright, well we were at Comic Con\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nI've been before, it is super, super fun\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nAlia, is that right?\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nYeah, I mean in my head\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nEarlier, guess who else I know\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nWho?\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nBrad Copeland and John Levenstein\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nWho are those people?\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nThe writers, sorry\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nSorry, they're only writers\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nI've never met\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nThe great writers\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nI've never met, what's the will in the show?\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nHunting?\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nNo, the one in the show\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nI've never met any of the actors, but I know the writers\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nWho's the will in the show?\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nI wanted to say Forte\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nWho's the will, sir?\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nYou're twined, comedically\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nListen, man, I'm freaking out\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nYou're doing great, we know people in common\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nYou're safe with me\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nI always get Will Forte mixed up with Will Sasso\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nAnd it's really weird\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nThat's crazy\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nYou were talking about Will Forte at a party\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nAnd I was imagining Will Sasso\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nAnd it was hilarious\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nWhat party was that, Spencer?\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nThat party that there was hot dogs\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nOn a plate or some shit\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nAnd people were yelling at people\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nTrying to tee up, Dan, for the next segment\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nTell us about your party experience, Ryan Ridley\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nSo every year, Ali, entertainment weekly\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nOr don't\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nEntertainment weekly has a party\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:19.000\nAt Comic-Con\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nI think it's the fanciest of the parties\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nIn terms of like\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nIt starts at nine\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nAnd then by ten, it's filled to fire code\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nAnd then you can't get in\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nRight\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nThat was me just kind of teeing\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nThat was my crawl\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nSo you weren't left out of this\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nSo you guys went to this amazing party?\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nLet me give you some backstory\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nI'm in my head a lot\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nThis Comic-Con is weird\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nI don't know if I should feel more shame\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nLess shame, more insecure\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nLess insecure\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nI don't know which way the compass should spin\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nThe what should spin?\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nThe compass, for my psychological state of mind\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nBut I'll have you know\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nThe hottest party at Comic-Con\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nThe entertainment weekly party\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nAnd I'll have you know\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nThat it was all I was talking about at work\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nFor the entire week\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nLording it over everyone's heads\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nOn top of the fact\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nThat I found out that Dan and Justin\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\nWere not invited\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nI'm a writer in Rick and Morty\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\nI should clarify that\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nYou understand the relationship\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nThis hierarchy\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nHow did you score this coveted invitation?\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nJeff?\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nBecause neither did I know about it\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nNor was I invited\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nI was told by haters\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nThat it was my\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nAgencies\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nBehind the scenes manipulations\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nApparently that's not true\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nThe answer I got was\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nIt's because I'm cool\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nWho told you that?\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nYeah, did you tell yourself?\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nHis agent told me that\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nWait\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nWhat's the difference though\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nIf you're going down the road\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nOf it's cool to be invited\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nTo a Hollywood party\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nYou're already in trouble\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nI'm happy to go down that road\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nYou're right, objectively you're already in trouble\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nBut you're in trouble when you wake up\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nIt's a material universe\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nUntil we return\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nTo the beams of light that we were\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nOriginally before the Big Bang\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nWhich happens\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nSo that light could bounce off\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nStay on target\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nStay on target\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nComic-Con 2016\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nI want to know what happened at the party\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nWhy is it cool\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nWhat is the difference\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nIf your agency making manipulations\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nWhy does that make you less cool\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nIn terms of a Hollywood party\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nBecause they're haters\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nThey're trying to detract from his achievements\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nBut why would that detract from it\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nLike usual, you get me\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nYeah man\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nYou're like George Costanza\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nI just realized that\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nCan I explain something\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nExactly\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nExactly\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nThis is what he doesn't get\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nI'm running all of this\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nThis experience we're about to talk to\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nIt's all through a filter\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nI don't belong, I shouldn't be here\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nI hate myself\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nGive me an example of a hater\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nAnd what a hater said to you about this\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nWho is Hayton\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:29.000\nThat's probably one of them\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nHere she is\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nOther writers and the staff of Rick and Morty\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nWere they trying\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nWere they trying to diminish\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nYour potential joy in this party\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nNo Jeff, they were trying to\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nOf course\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nThat's what they're always trying to do\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nWhat happened at the party\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nHow can you say your name\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nYou're on the list\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nBut you said you were lording it\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nOver everybody, so of course\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nYou created your own haters\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nHe did do that\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nYou're a hater\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nParty\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nOf course you're going to take a shot at that\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nI didn't even\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nStoop to take the bait\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nI just called my agent and said\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nWhy am I not on the EW list\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nI just found out Ryan fucking Ridley is\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nExactly\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nHaters\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nSo the first person\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nWe saw when he walked in\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nWas Will Forte\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nDammit Spencer\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nPicture Will Sasso for this story\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nContinue\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nAnd all of a sudden we see\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nIs this even acceptable to talk about these people\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nAnd what they're doing behind the scenes of things\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nThat's the EW party, right\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nMaybe I'm going to make Will Forte\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nLook bad, actually no, he was a hero\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nHe was your own judgment\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nAnd he couldn't get in\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nOr he clearly came and changed his mind\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nAt some point, I don't know what happened\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nBut he was like I'm out of here, going on their bar\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nAnd I'm looking at that and going\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nWhat the fuck hope do I have\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nI don't understand how this party works\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nThey're not letting Will Forte in\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nI'm sitting here thinking I'm on the list\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nFinally I'm on the list\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nThe list means nothing\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nWhat time are you getting there?\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\n30, party starts at 9, cool time\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nWord of God, it's packed\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nI asked multiple friends to see if\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nMy friend could get in and they're like\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nIt's already at capacity, it seems like\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nIt's going to be rough to get you A\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nOn the list and then B in\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nThe only thing that haunts me about that\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nIs that we did, the entire time we were standing\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nOutside waiting to be let in\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nThere was one exception to that rule\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nThere seemed to be abiding by strict\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nFire code in letting people in\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nExcept the fucking workaholics guys\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nRight past us\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nI don't know what they named\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nOn Comic Con those dudes it feels like\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:51.000\nOur glib enmity is becoming real now\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nI'm so jealous of them\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nThere were professional football players\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nWho I was told were professional football players\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nStanding there, I didn't recognize them\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nCertainly, but there are people\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nWill Forte's getting turned away\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nWe're sitting here, Dan Harmon\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nI guess he's a big deal, they're not letting\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nUs in and all of a sudden the fucking workaholics\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nTwo thirds of them by the way\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nWhich one was missing?\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nI don't know, the one in the Pitch Perfect movies\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nWell obviously ironically the actual workaholic\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nFrom their troupe, you know\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nThe guy who's back in LA making phone calls\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nHe's working, yeah\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nAnd they get the whistle on the wave\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nAnd they just stroll right past us\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nLast Comic Con I was hanging out with them\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nAnd Tom Green rolled up and was like\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nYou guys want to smoke some weed?\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nWe were like, alright\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nSmoking at a hotel lobby with Tom Green\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.000\nAnd the workaholics did\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nThose guys\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nThe first time I ran into them at Comic Con\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nIt was, I had to\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nFind out retroactively after a guy talked to me\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nFor a half hour asking a bunch of weird questions\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nAbout New Zealand\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nThat they had convinced that guy that I was Peter Jackson\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nOh that's a great joke\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nIt was really funny\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nThat is so good\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nThe only guy who arguably\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nWas hurt by it\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nWas a guy who kind of\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nIn practical joke karma\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nIf he's such a\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nFan of Peter fucking Jackson\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nHe should know I'm not Peter Jackson\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nLike I don't have an accent\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nBut he was definitely\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nHe was a little traumatized\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nBecause the punchline of the story\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nIs the guy after his third\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nI've never been to New Zealand\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nAnd the guy's like\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nOkay, very funny\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\nWhen you're shooting there\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nWhen I was shooting there\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nI'm a writer\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nAnd the guy went\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nFucking guys told me you were Peter Jackson\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nLike he was so\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nHe looked over at that\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nThey couldn't have written it better\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nAnd I was like you assholes\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nAnd they were like\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nI wouldn't even say they were cracking up\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nBecause they probably do that every five minutes\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nThey're almost bored by their own sensibilities\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\nThey're like we know it's funny\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nNo, I like those guys\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nSo you guys got into the party eventually?\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nYeah, what happened in the party man?\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nDan, you were saying earlier\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nThat there was a control\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nBouncer guy that was going a little over the edge\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nNo human being\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nShould be given that much power\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nLike there's always checks and balances\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nThere was a 25 year old kid\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nWho for the first time in his life\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nWas like telling people\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nHe might recognize from movies and stuff\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nThey can't come in, he was like told to hold the line\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nAnd he fucking snapped\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nHe was inconsolably\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nHe had lost his mind\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nHe was like\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nThe guy that Tom Cruise has to kill\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nIn the basement in one of the worlds\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nOh god\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nLike he had just become more\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nStrategy than man\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nTo the point where he was like\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nHis own mother was like what he had doing\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nBecause we got\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nThis happened twice\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nLike we got\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nWaved by my friend\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nDan Snirson\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nDo I know a guy from Entertainment Weekly\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nDan Snirson\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nComes out\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:11.000\nBecause he's\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nAnticipating that it should be pretty easy\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nTo get somebody in\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nAnd he works there\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nSo he waves me forward so we have to walk\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nPast all the people that can't get in\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nAnd we stand there\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nLike man\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nHis head was just wagging\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nAll the time\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:31.000\nEverything that was being said\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nTo him was\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nGo fuck yourself and your whole family\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nAnd then whatever you were actually saying\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nHe was just adding this\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nAnd I said\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nI got a little smile out of him\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.000\nI think I diffused him just a hair\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nBecause he's kept doing that\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nAnd I said\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nYou're gonna be fine\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nIs gonna get in there\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nAnd I would not have come up here\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.000\nI had been led to believe\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.000\nThat you're doing fine\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:01.000\nBut I think that just hit him\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nLike a drop of carbohydrates\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.000\nMaybe he was just like showing teeth\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.000\nMaybe I misinterpreted as a smile\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nAnyways hard to get into the party\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nBut you're welcome\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nBecause eventually\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:15.000\nDan Snirson who is the\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\nMench of the millennia\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nThis guy could have just blown me off\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nIt's a terrible dynamic too\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:23.000\nAnd you're like I don't even want to go to the stupid party\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.000\nThat they won't let me in\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.000\nI have to get into the story\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nWait Dan are you saying that\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\nWithout you\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nDan Harmon and Dan Snirson\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:35.000\nThe improbably named\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nDan Snirson\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nThat Ryan fucking Ridley\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nWouldn't have gotten into that party\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:43.000\nWe were all on the list\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:45.000\nThis was about fire code\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:47.000\nThis is about games is what it was\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nWhite people will party\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nSay RSVP with a plus one\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nAnd then you'll be able to get into the party\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\nAnd suddenly now you can't get to this level\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nOh now you can get to this level but there's nine more levels after that\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:59.000\nWhat the fuck kind of game are they playing\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:01.000\nWhy are they doing this to me\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:03.000\nI'm the hero of the story\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:05.000\nI don't know if the audience I feel like\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nIs the fucking villain in the story\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:09.000\nI'm the hero of the story\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nI'm the hero this isn't my world\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nI don't get invited to these parties\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:15.000\nAnd I'm like oh I'm getting invited to this party\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nFrom childhood\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nWe've known since we were eight years old\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nHe's never even met a celebrity\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.000\nHe's never even been in California\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nI'm giving him the time of his life\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nHe's getting high with the wave on the yacht\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nHe's with the Dr. Drew and EZ\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:31.000\nGiving him noogies and stuff\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:33.000\nAt this party\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nDr. Drew and EZ\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:37.000\nOr Dr. Dre and EZ\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:39.000\nWhich is the one that gives advice\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nOn TV shows\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nThose two were together\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nBecause EZ\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:47.000\nEZ's dead\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nEZ's dead\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nThe young actor who played EZ\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nI'm not an idiot\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nHe was the one that was with Dr. Drew\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:57.000\nThe psychologist\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nDo you think they thought it was funny\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\nThat he was hanging that with Dr. Drew\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nKind of like Dr. Dre\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nWhat kind of strange pairings at this party\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nYou wouldn't believe it such as\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nSuch as\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nWell I really\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nJust want to brag this isn't funny at all\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nYou're going to take us\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nAcross the threshold of the party right\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nHopefully\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:21.000\nDanny McBride came\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:23.000\nUp to me\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nHe's a fan\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.000\nI don't know if he's a fan of the podcaster\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:29.000\nIf he's just Rick and Morty\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:31.000\nSomething tells me it's Rick and Morty\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:33.000\nSomething tells me it's Rick and Morty\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:35.000\nHe wanted to meet me\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nThe podcast\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nWho's like somebody\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:41.000\nIn the new trailer for Justice League\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nAnybody know about that little\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nDiddy\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nThank you\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nHe's an\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\nUnequirable taste\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nIt's like George\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nI wish I was at the party with you\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nTo see it through your eyes\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:01.000\nRemember my hijinks\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:03.000\nI was yelling at people\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:05.000\nIt's great to have hijinks\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:07.000\nI always do pranks at big parties\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:09.000\nYou're serious at this party\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:11.000\nHe just stood up everybody\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nJesus Christ\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nHe dropped that microphone on accident\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nAnd then did what a cat would do\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nWhich is just he turned it into\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nGrooming himself\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nIt was so clearly an accident\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nSo Ryan\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nYou are the self-proclaimed hero of the story\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nYou just walked us across the first\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nThreshold I believe right\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:35.000\nWhen you become active\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nWhat happens?\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\nWell\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.000\nGive us the key scene\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nWe find out that Dan Schneersen\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nCan get us into\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nThe next area\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nWhich is just another place to wait\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\nTo get into the party\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nBut a little bit nicer\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nWell I will say a lot nicer\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nHe kept bringing us hot dogs and drinks\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nThis guy who works\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nAt Entertainment Weekly\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.000\nWho interviewed me about Heat Vision\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nLike\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nHe's done\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nI would say\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nBecause of that\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nWe have this bond\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nHe's done interviews with me since then\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nWe were kind of like kids\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:19.000\nIn the industry together\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nLike there was a fraternal bond\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nThere maybe\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nAnd he respects you\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nI'm sorry this is so fucked up\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nHis party ends and he was missing it\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nAnd he brought us hot dogs\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nTaking drink orders\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nAnd the party was so crowded\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nAnd then this waiting area\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nIs this like in a hotel?\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nThe Hard Rock Cafe\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nOh my god\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nI just blew my mind\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nI was at my happiest there\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nBecause there were hot dogs\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nAnd I kept thinking\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:53.000\nIf you just flipped it\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nEasily that crowded hot area\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nIf Johnny Depp was over here\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nAnd you were told\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nThat this was like the platinum\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nBecause it's like a place where you can go like this\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nAnd like\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nYou go to the Viper Room\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nIt's weird that culture of\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nThis little tiny booth\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nHaving a table is a VIP thing\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:15.000\nAt the Viper Room\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nBut if you put that table anywhere else\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nYou'd be like\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nI'm doing you a favor by sitting here\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nThe game they played is we got into the\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:25.000\nParty, the waiting area\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:27.000\nAnd it was open\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:29.000\nThere were six of us that were together\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\nAnd by the way immediately open bar\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\nSpread out great\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:35.000\nMagical amazing wonderful fresh air\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nAnd they're bringing us churros\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:39.000\nAnd hot dogs\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nAnd we're laughing and we're vaping\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nAnd we're having a good time\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nBut I'm still thinking\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nBut I want to get in fucking there\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nWhich looks miserable\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nWhy did they do this to us?\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nIt's about the search\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nIt became a game\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nIt was tolerated if it wasn't\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nThe\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nThe Snirson Factor turned it into a role playing game\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nBecause it was like\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nThere was a thing that needed to be unlocked\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nLike Minecraft or something\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nLike you needed to make something to make something to make something\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nAnd I did get\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nThat's the longest I've ever waited for anything\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nAnd I was like I was kind of held together\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nWith this sort of quest aspect of it\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nBecause they kept saying five more minutes\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nAnd then we'll go and then you know what I mean\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nAnd then you go like well maybe five more minutes after that too\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nBecause you don't want to\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nIt's like gambling\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nRyan you talked so much shit to your coworkers\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nFor the past seven days\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nThat you now have to get into this party\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nYou can't go back home with your tail between your legs\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nAnd say that you didn't get in\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nAnd that was fueling every fiber of my being\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nThat night\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nSo here's the weird thing about the party\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nYou finally get past the threshold\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nAnd the party, it's around a pool\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nCan I tell you one little detail\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:51.000\nThat's going to come back later in the story\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nSo while we were out there\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.000\nI was trying to you know play the game of\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:57.000\nLike alright let's have a little\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.000\nFun with the situation\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nI knew we were the losers technically\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nAnd they're the winners and they're on the other side\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nAnd they bring us hot dogs so there's a room\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nThat had like a patio\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nThat went out to kind of our area\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nBut it was also on the other side of it\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.000\nWas the real party and there was a private room\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nAnd these people were in it, I didn't see who was in it\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nI grabbed the hot dog and I went up to that\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nAnd I leaned over and I go yeah you guys might be in that party\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nThere's no hot dogs\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nAnd they're kind of like not looking at me\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nBasically acting like you guys are acting now\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\nThey can hear you though, there's no like wall between you two\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nNo there's no wall, no\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:31.000\nIt was like a plexiglass like Pope Mobile wall\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nIt was like bulletproof plastic\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:35.000\nThis is going to pay off later\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nWhoever was in there definitely heard me screaming\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:39.000\nThis is going to pay off later\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\nSo you're just yelling at strangers now\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nYou mean Taylor Swift because that's who you were yelling at\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nDid you not notice that?\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nI was yelling at the Hollywood elite Jeff\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nSo far you are\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\nDefinitely the hero of the story\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nThank you\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nThere's no dispute there\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:57.000\nSo remember that detail so then we get\n\n56:57.000 --> 56:59.000\nFinally let in to the grand\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.000\nEvent\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:03.000\nOkay\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.000\nSo it's in the courtyard of a hotel\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:07.000\nAnd there's a pool\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:09.000\nAnd so you're partying around the pool\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.000\nAnd but in the pool\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.000\nBecause\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nWhat are you going to put in the pool?\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nAwards\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nThere's water in it\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nBut what do you do?\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nDo you put copies of your magazine?\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nThey'll get wet\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:27.000\nYou put a grease\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nShark in a bunch of cones\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nSo in the pool\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nIs a bunch of\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nWhat do you call them?\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nLifesavers\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nIs that what you call them?\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nIntertubes\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nThey're like little smaller intertubes\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:45.000\nAnd\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:47.000\nBut also a bunch of\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nYoung people\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nThat were hired\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nModels\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nThey were just like treading water\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nAnd hanging out on the floaties\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nAnd everyone was just\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nStaring at them\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nWe were all\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:05.000\nNo matter how famous you were\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nIf you were out of the pool\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nBecause they were in the pool\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nYou were better than them\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nThey were reduced to\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nThe white-haired guy that shows up at the party\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nAnd boogie nights that end up having to have the Coke girl\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nLike that guy\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nWith the gray hair that just looks\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nAt Walberg's dick and then it's like\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:25.000\nIt's pretty nice\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nIt's nice to meet you\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nKind of like weird Jackie Gleason\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nJeff the killer\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nAnd they're all pruney\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nAnd forced to say\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nI'm so thirsty\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nBecause we're like\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nSo everyone's just\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nStaring at these people in the pool\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nAnd I'll tell you\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nSomebody came up to me and said\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\nCan we ask you some questions\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\nLike what do you think about this pool thing\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nYou ask the people in the pool this question\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nNo, they ask me what I thought of the people\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nIn the pool\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nI just can't get over the fact\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nThe crazy thing is that right now\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.000\nIf I got into the pool\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:05.000\nThat would be the weird thing\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nRight\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nI was just freaking out\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nI'm standing in a hotel\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nAnd I'm in the courtyard of a hotel\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nAnd there are humans\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nBeing used as art\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nI hope they do\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nI could ruin everything\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nBy using the pool right\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\nLike Dan Harbour got in the pool\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:27.000\nOr just anybody though\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nA family from Iowa got in the pool\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nEveryone would be like Jesus Christ do something\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:35.000\nThere was a lot of talk about me going in the pool\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nIn my own head\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nAnd I was like trying to weigh\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nLike\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nThis could be the coolest move ever\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nI'd be the guy who fucking would\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nFuck the facade\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nOf the veneer of we're all too cool to go in the pool\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nIn this fucking party I'm gonna go in\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nAnd everybody will talk about me and know my name\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nI hate the Hollywood elites\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nI hate them\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.000\nDid the pool people count towards the capacity\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nOf the fire crew\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nBecause that's stupid as fuck\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nI think they were technically their fire proof\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nBecause they were way\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nThey are in water\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nThey're there to watch everybody burn\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nThey're the only people that could\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nThey could live through a fire for like 36 hours\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nUntil all the water evaporated and they'd be like\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nIt's getting hot in this pool\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nBut they've got all of that time\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nLike we're still on the clock man\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nNow what were these\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nHow many of these model swimmers were there\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nThey were like I'm gonna say\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nI think they were like shifting\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nThere was a little bit of a rotation there\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nIt looked like there were seven or eight\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nThe thing that really threw me\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nBecause I was just like watching\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nI was super high\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nAnd so the whole thing had this weird\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nThat's weird\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nBut I kind of appreciate that stuff\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nBecause then you get the luxury of feeling\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nLike Hunter S. Thompson\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nLike that's a favor they're doing you\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nLike it's like oh this party is crazy\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nI kind of feel like if it wasn't\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nWe'd be disappointed\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nIf there wasn't some weird fucking thing\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nOut of those parties is like\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nHow odd they are that they're like humans\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nAre treated differently\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nYou're more important for this like\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nCast system yeah and you're like\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nOkay I guess like a shit on your face\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nAnd they're like it would be kind of okay\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nDavid Cross has that\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nExtended pit about like when\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nDesserts have like gold leaf on them\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nAnd it's just like fuck you\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nI can't even digest this\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nI'm just gonna shit it\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nOut of my asshole\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nAfter you serve it to me\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nIt's gold\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nIt is like\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nWe use interchangeably words like\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nYou know like red carpet stuff\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nLike luxury, pizzazz, glamour\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nThe La La Land and all that stuff\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nBut it's like all it is it's just like\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nIt's just this fantasy of like holy shit\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nLike we're in the running man\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nAnd like you're running and I'm not\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nLike\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nThat's why I thought anyways\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nIf you called something\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nA VIP something I'm in like I'd pay\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000\n$50 for the letters VIP to be\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nAdded to an otherwise identical ticket\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nThat I had into an empty\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nWarehouse where nothing happened\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nExcept farts\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nBut if I'm going then I want\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nThe VIP ticket to the fart house\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nBut\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nSo the weird thing for me\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nThe deal breaker was I wasn't like offended\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nBy any of it I wasn't like I was just like\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nHigh and like kind of going this is funny\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nLike it's like I always\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nThis is a good chance for me to pretend\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nI'm in the first scene of someone's\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nBiopic you know like cause it's like\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nThe camera's gotta be coming down on this\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nLike cause it could cost money to produce\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nThis set so like\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nAnd there's like a bunch of people here so there's must be\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nMaybe Frank Oz is meeting someone\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nIn the corner or like\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nLike Dan Harmon was there\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nYeah I'm part of the panning thing\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nAnd I'm going like the thing about community\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nLike what would I have to say to be\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nTo be recognizable in this like panning\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nShot\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nSo but the thing that really threw me\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nAbout the pool thing was this\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nThere was this one kid this dude\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nHe kept there was music playing\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nAnd he was like he kept like rapping\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nHe was like if it was\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nHip hop he was like he was like\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nWrapping along with the music\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nAnd I was like it was really\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nThe guy who was hired to just swim in the pool\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nCause he was like sending this\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nDirect visual and audio signal\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nIt's like no I'm here in the\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nAt the same party\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nThis is all happening to all of us at the same time\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nAnd it was like stop it\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nLike you're supposed to\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nBe like you're supposed to\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nLike yeah like you're supposed to be\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nDetached like\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nIt would be like if a burger grew legs\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nLike on your bun\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nAnd tried to like it was like\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nYou'd be like this is bad\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nAnd the chef would be like no I think that's great\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nYou like beef don't you\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nAnd you'd be like no I like\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nDiscs of meat\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nWhere the other people in the pool being like\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nHenry what are you doing man\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nI think they would maybe float away from him\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nA little bit cause they're like I'm not going\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nHitching my inner tube to that star\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nThere's one pool person that was\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nShowboat and you're saying is that what the justice was\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nHe was just having a good time\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nI'm saying\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nThat's the reason why he was doing the thing that threw me\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nIt's not his good time that threw me\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nWhat threw me was the actual audio\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nVisual stimulus of\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nHim\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nInstead of just floating aimlessly\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nIn the pool which I thought was like oh it's like\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nFuture art it's like handsome

--> 01:04:57.000\nHe's always got a man in the pool\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nAlways keeps flipping the actors\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nIn the pool\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nWhat do you think the explanation was\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nDo you think that it was they all lined up\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nBefore they got in the pool and their boss said\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nAlright listen here are the rules\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nThis, that and the other thing that breaks are every 15 minutes\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nSo no don't just\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nZone out and stare dead eye and kind of\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nFloat around, don't talk\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nJust have fun with it, just be yourself\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nAnd then he was the one who broke the rule\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nOr he followed it\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nOr it was the opposite and they were like you guys\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nHave fun, rap, riff with the\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nYell up at the celebrities and do

01:05:35.000\nI'm fucking doing it\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nYeah it could easily be that the rest of them are like\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nFuck this I'm going dead inside\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nOr we don't know\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nThat list leaked to Kanye\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nPeople were like oh Kanye is so\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nCrazy because he wants such specific things\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nBut think about it he was doing the same thing\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nAnd so the list was like\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nDon't make eye contact, it was like a really specific\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nList of things that human art should do\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nAt a party\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nI kind of get it if you're going to go through the threshold\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nAs I would never of using humans as\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nArt I understand\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nLike having a very meticulous list\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nOf like I want to do something really specific here\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nLike where every five seconds\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nYou all go\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nOr I want you all\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nTo coordinate\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nEmotionally I want you all to feel\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nWashed out\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nRight? Yeah\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nIs that like humans doing something\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nNot natural\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nIt should be like a screen saver\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nWhere you're like okay they're doing this again\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nIt's floating\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nHe was like padding the water\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nAnd making little splishies\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nWith the beat\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nI love hip hop all day long\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nAnd it was like somebody stun him\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nHe must have been good\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nTape a\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nTape a taser to one of these sticks\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nBecause he was showing humanity\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nAnd that breaks your heart\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nExactly\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nBecause then it becomes\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nNow you're at a party with strangers\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nSome of whom can't get out of the pool\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nAs opposed to\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nBeing at a party where humans are\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nYes exactly\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nDo you think any of these people in the pool\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nKnew that there was actually a hero in their midst\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nWho was contemplating joining that\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nSomebody had come to the party\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nAgainst all odds to save\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nI know a kindred spirit when I see one\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nAnd this guy you know what else he did\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nKenny Powers walked by\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nAnd all of a sudden he started going\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nHe was the only one of the pool people\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nHe just started going we're not worthy\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nWe're not worthy and I was like\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nThat's the fucking dork\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nAnd then a beat later I was like\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nThat's me\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nI'm that pool guy\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nI felt like when they were getting their pictures\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nWith people it was toward the end of the party\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nAnd it was like people charging out of the field\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nAfter like a soccer game or something\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nYou got five minutes\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nYou're fucking autographs\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nI get the fuck out\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nI think it's time\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nFor me to bring back a little plot point\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nIn our story\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nSo just when you go through\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nThe first threshold\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nAnd you wait in the first level\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nOf purgatory and then the second level\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nAnd then the hot dog's coming\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nYou finally get into what you think\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nIs the promised land\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nAnd you wander around and you're like\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nMore Game of Thronesers and you know\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nYou're just rubbing up against them and you don't care\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nAnd there's the guys from Arrow and it's like\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nA living wax museum\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nAnd all I'm doing with my buddy\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nWho's never even met a celebrity\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nJust like look at that person\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nThere's one goddamn room\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nAnd I'm like well I'm in\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nI worked hard for this I'm going everywhere\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nI'm going to use the whole buffalo in this party\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nAnd I walked up to this fucking room\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nAnd I look in this room\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nEmergency exit\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nAnd there's two giant dudes\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nStaying there but they could have been just regular guys\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nI couldn't quite tell they weren't polo shirts\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nAnd I look past them\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nAnd I see James Cameron\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nOh yeah\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nThere was one more level of elite\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nInside this fucking concentric\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nCircle of eliteness\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nJust when you think we're all one now\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nWe're all the Hollywood elite\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nFuck everybody else\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nIs he alone in the room or what's his little air\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nHe has no equals\n\n01:09:09.000 -->

01:09:17.000\nHe's the loneliest guy in showbiz\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nEverybody knows that\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nHeavy lies in the crowd\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nIt's celebrity Highlander\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nLike yeah\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nBut actually there was a point\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nWhen there was a whistle and a wave and the pool guy got up\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nAnd went into the James Cameron room\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nAnd he's like that guy's good\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nThe one that had pleased him with his rapping\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nBring me the spry lad\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nHe's like so you're comfortable in water for that long\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nHow much for the pool people\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nJust cut to the Eli Roth thing with James Cameron\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nAnd a fucking ivory bathtub\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nThe kids like dangling and chained over him\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nAnd he takes like this scythe\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nYou exist in the water\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nRubbing himself in his blood\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nAh\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nAnd there's a speakerphone in the corners\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nThere's his agent going like okay so Avatar 3\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nDo you do IMAX\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nOr are we going direct to\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nSmake, smake, smake, smake\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nWhat?\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nWhy are you, what is happening to you\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nI'm smacked,

smacked, smacked, smacked\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nHe's on the phone he's like\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nI can't represent James anymore\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nI'm losing my mind\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nThere goes Todd, he can barely speak\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nBut he's James Cameron's agent\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nDoing great\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nWhat are you going to do\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nSmacked, smacked, smacked, smacked\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nBy the way\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nIf you haven't guessed already\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nThat was the room that he yelled\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nAbout the hot dogs in 2\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nOh\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nHot bags\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nYeah\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nJames Cameron heard me rubbing those hot dogs\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nRight in his fucking face\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nThis never happened to me at a party before\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nI was at one point\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nSpencer Crittenden\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nWho is summer on Rick and Morty\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nHer husband, get this\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000\nHe's an Irish firefighter\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000\nSpoiler\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nYeah\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nYou didn't picture it\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nIt's like how much more manly can you get\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nHe looks like an underwear model\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nWho's also an Irish firefighter\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nHe didn't quite understand\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nBut after a while he was like you're right\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nI was like no I'm sure Irish fires are harder to fight\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nWhat do you mean\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nThe timbers different\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nI was like no the fucking\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nYour people are different\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nThey've been through the worst\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nThey're more extreme\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nI'm sure one of the Irish houses on fire\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nThe fire is just a couple degrees hotter\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nAnd harder to put out\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nThere's certainly more flammable fluids around\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nI wasn't connecting\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nThose dots\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nI was praising\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nTheir\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nBe set upon history\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nAnd heritage\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nI turned out not to be Irish\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nI said in my DNA I'm fucking British\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nYou are no Irish\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nI'm Irish\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nI thought you were doing an IRA joke\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nBecause he's Northern Irish\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nWhy would I do that\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nI think he\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nHe says the wrong things all the time\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nWhy would you ever think that I\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nWould put my foot in my mouth\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nSpeaking of which\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nI want to play this recording before I forget\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nThis is my girlfriend Cody\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nThis is\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nThis is\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nI don't know if this is going to translate\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nI just can't get it\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nYou have a song stuck in your head\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nLike they say\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nIf you make it be in other people's head\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nThat's how you get rid of it\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nIt follows or something\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nI just have her\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nHer childhood voice\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nStuck in my head because she's in the bathtub\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nAnd her dad's trying to get her to get out\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nBut she's trying to get her dad to\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nEat soap\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nLather\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nShe's handing him a plate\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nIs this from an old childhood video\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nThat you watched a lot of her?\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nShe did this yesterday with her\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nOne of my favorite things\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nIs my girlfriend's channeling video\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nI forgot that detail\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nThis is the home movie of hers\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nShe's 12 years younger than me\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nShe's a baby\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nBut it's like\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nI know that model of camcorder\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nIt's not wonder years\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nFootage where she's moving fast\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nAnd there's no audio\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nIt's fucking\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nShit, I did channel 101 videos\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nThat her dad's using to taper\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nNaked\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nShe's a child\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nBut these things get stuck in your head\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nIt's like\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nWhat are you going to do? I'm emotionally\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nI have a very low IQ\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nEmotionally\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nThat means\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nI can date\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nI can date younger people because I work very hard\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nAnd I haven't matured\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nYou've still been talking\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nAnd you're still like it's fine\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nShe likes me and I like her\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nDan forgot we were here for a while\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nI'm trying to find the\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nHow do you make\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000\nHow do you make the speaker\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000\nThing go\n\n01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000\n12 years older than his girlfriend\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nDo you have to plug her in?\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nHow do you do it?\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000\nIt automatically is on speaker\n\n01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nWhere do you put the fuel in?\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nAlright\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nOh shit, I already fucked up\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nI scrubbed the thing\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nWe're going to have to do it live\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nCody, get up here\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nWe're going live people\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nThis is her telling her dad to eat\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nThe soap suds\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nEat it\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nEat it okay\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nEat it\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nEat it\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nEat that\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nEat left\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nEat this\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nEat it\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nEat it\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nDid you eat it? Yes\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nThat was so cute\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nShe was 12 years old then?\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nShe says she's 27\n\n01:15:25.000 -->

important\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nI don't know\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nShe turns and goes did you eat it?\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nAnd he goes yeah\n\n01:15:39.000 -->

just like\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nShe peed and so now she has to clean up\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nShe's saying you can't see anything\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nThere's no pee on camera but she's like pushing something\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nShe's going I have to\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nShe just wants to stay in the tub\n\n01:16:03.000 -->

01:16:13.000\nYeah I just keep hearing her go eat it\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nDid you eat it?\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nEvery time I eat\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nI just hear her like eat it\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nAnd I'm like alright\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nIf she only knew that one day\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nShe would be with someone who\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nDiane I'm sorry that was cute and all\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nBut do you have anything else on the agenda?\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nI wanted to take a little here\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nYou know I'm sure Alia\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nShe was acting at such a young age\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nHere's a projection I'm making\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nIt's like you in order to survive with your sanity\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nThis silly business\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nYou've had to\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nBecome\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nPretty well balanced\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nOr your alternative was to\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nKnock it over liquor stores\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nJust to get my high\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nSo you've had\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nA long ago\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nYou had to deal with some threshold where you're like\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nThe only hope for survival\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nPsychologically is to know\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nThat all this stuff is horseshit\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nSo it's a bad timing\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nIt's bad that this would be your episode\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nTalking about rock climbing\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000\nWe're talking about\n\n01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nWhich I also do\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nI can do 11a if anyone knows top roping\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nI can get as high as 11a\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nThat's like maybe like bowling\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000\n200 so\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nI don't want to talk about rock climbing ever\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nIs that the indoor rock climbing thing?\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nThat's your god damn right\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nI did level zeros and ones\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nSo rock climbing conversations\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nThat's in bouldering\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nNobody knows about rock climbing in this fucking room\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nI'm in the wrong\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nRoom\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nBut I'll continue\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nYou know what\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nWe'll find you the right room\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nThat party wasn't the only\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nClimbing I do\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nI just came to me\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nI was like that's a\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nRock climbing\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nSocial climbing at the Hollywood parties\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nJust want to make sure everybody got it\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nEat it\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nDid you eat it?\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nDid you eat it?\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nDid you eat it?\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nCan I tell a story?\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nThat was my point I wanted to add some humanity\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nBecause I'm sure if you're not in Hollywood\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nYou're probably into babies\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nWait wait did someone say no\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nThe story\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nThese parties have a strong context\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nFor me in that way\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nWho are you identify yourself?\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nThey don't have to identify themselves\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nWhy not?\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nIt's your insecurity it's not their problem\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nI'm about to tell\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nWhat I think is probably one of the\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nDon't hype it up too much\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nDon't hype it up too much\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nNo you're doing great man\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nRyan I've known you for many years now\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nI would say\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nWe don't really hang out enough\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nI've never seen you so aggressive before\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nYou're a little more aggressive\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nNo he's like this\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nHe's like George Costanza\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nI'm a rock climber Jerry\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nI can't do the voice\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nI'm going to tell you I learned something\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nI've known Jeff\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nFor 12 years\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nI've known Dan for 12 years\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nI've worked with Dan\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nProbably 50,000 million hours\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nOn a few different things\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nHe's just a really slow writer\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nI've known Spencer\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nFor about a year and a half\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nTwo years this guy fucking gets me\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nHe gets me more than you do\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nThat's not your fault I work with him\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nHe should get me\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nHow do you think I'm assessing you at the moment?\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nSometimes you get me\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nWhat the fuck\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nIs this his friend here\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nWho is this guy\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nI get Ridley because I'm like\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nLight gray and then he's like\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nJust the slightly\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nDarker shade of gray\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nLike I could be him on a bad day\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nOr a good day\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nYeah\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nI could be him on a bad day\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nOr I could be him\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nIf I was having a bad day\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nYou have to know where the commas are\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nAnd that's it\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nWait, so what's the\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nYeah, what's the\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nWhat happened at the party\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nEverything I've said\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nThis whole shtick I'm doing\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nIt's all to hoist myself up\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nIn the ultimate patard\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nAnd you're all like\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nMost of the audience I could tell doesn't like me\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nBelieve me, the no girl is just the brave one\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nDoesn't bother me\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nI know I've got some people who are like\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nWhat are you talking about\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nAnd you're like in the Spencer camp\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nLet's hear some claps\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nThank you\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nPlease clap\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nSo we all\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nLove meeting\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nYour Game of Thronesers\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nWe all love meeting your\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nEWs and your Will Fortes\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nAnd whatnot\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nBut I'm about to tell you a story\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nThat is going to high road everybody\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nOn this stage and in this room\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nI\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nTee it up\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nJust a little higher\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nYou're a high dive act\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nRyan is a high dive act\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nWhere the ladder goes up so high\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nThat the thing you show up to see\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nIs him fainting\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nYou don't even get to see it\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nYou just know it happened\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nLike someone radios down\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000\nYeah, he fainted\n\n01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nI was wondering\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nWhat he was going to jump into\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nThere's a cup of water\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nThere's a guy rapping\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nIf you guys\n\n01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nDon't give me the right answer\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nTo the question I'm about to ask you\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nJesus Christ\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nI'm going to shame you all\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nSo just be prepared\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nI'm empirically going to be the hero\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000\nAnd you, whoever does not know\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nThe answer to my question are going to be the villains\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nI was on the Comic-Con panel\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000\nFor and I wanted to get something\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nSigned by Berkeley Breadth\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nAt Bloom County\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nThat's not the person I want you to care about yet\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nCan I guess the answer before you ask?\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nSure\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nThe Colorado River\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nWe'll get there\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nI say I'm going to go meet\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nBerkeley Breadth and get something signed\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nCreative Bloom County's big inspiration to me\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000\nAt 3 o'clock\n\n01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nI walked to the IDW booth\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nWhere he was signing things\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nTurn on the corner\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nWho do I see sitting there?\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nRepresentative John Lewis\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nWho\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nDoesn't know who that is\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000\nWell no one's going to admit it because we know\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nWe know a trap of it\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nI didn't know who this was\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nI don't know who it is\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nAlright, yeah, who is he?\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nNo idea\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nYes, Booyah\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nCivil Rights Movement\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nCivil Rights Movement\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nHe was the Civil Rights Movement\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nYou met the Civil Rights Movement?\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nI feel like\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nThat backfired\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nI really thought that I could shame you guys for not knowing\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nBut you guys are celebrating the fact that you don't know who this is\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nYes, he was part of the Civil Rights Movement\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nThis is what no one knows all about\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nYou teed that up in the only way\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nThat would make it possible for us to celebrate\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nNot knowing a Civil Rights Leader\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nCan we take this again?\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nHe was the lesser of two evils to stomp on you\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nHe wasn't at the EW party, have we already left that place?\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nNo, this is earlier on the floor\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nSo I see Representative John Lewis\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nHe was part of the Civil Rights Movement\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nYou can see pictures of him marching with\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nMartin Luther King Jr\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nHe was portrayed in the movie Selma\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nEver heard of it?\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nOkay\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nWhere was I going with this?\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nDid I have a point?\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nHe was also the face of\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nRemember a little something called\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nThe Democrats trying to get the gun rights\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nShit passed a couple weeks ago\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nAnd the sit in and the all night thing\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000\nHe was the face of that\n\n01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nWhy is he if you guys are like\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nFuck the 60s\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nThat happened at the convention hall\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nYou wanted to talk about\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nGetting into the party, the EW party\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nThat's more important things\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nThis is the epilogue, dude\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nYou just really wanted to\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nOkay, alright\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nDid you hang out with him?\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nDid you guys have a drink together?\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nWho was telling this story? This isn't an interview\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nThis is a tale I'm unfolding at my own pace\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nOkay\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nI thought that was the end of the story\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nI hit plot points, I don't stop and go\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nDo you guys have any questions about what the booth looked like\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nOr what I was wearing now\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nYou tell the story properly\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nI think Dan, you do\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nI know Ryan\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nWhat happened? I missed something\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nI was in my head\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nSo you see him and what do you do\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000\nYou go, well none of this matters because this guy\n\n01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nActually did something\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nBerkeley breathed, he bites the gun\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nThe only thing that matters is this guy\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nDoes something\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nThat's a better picture\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nThat's a title for the episode\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000\nThat's a title for the episode\n\n01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nSo I gotta shake this guy's hands\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nFor real, I gotta shake this guy's hands\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000\nHe's a part of history\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nSo I go up and I see the guy\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nI go the end of the line\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nThe line guy, cousins of these people\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nWho don't let us in anywhere\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000\nSays, I'm sorry, the line's cut off, no more people\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nFuck, I wanna meet John Lewis\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nI wanna shake the hand of history\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000\nThe wave last night, I wanna do the opposite\n\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nI wanna balance the scales\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nCarmically\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000\nSo I say to the guy, can I please\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nMeet Mr. Lewis, and he goes, the line's cut off\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nNo exceptions, and I go, fuck, I gotta do it\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nI gotta do it, and I go\n\n01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nDo you know the show Rick and Morty?\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nYeah, I saw your badge\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nI know\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nWhich was pretty cool\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nPretty cool\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000\nThen he says\n\n01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000\nHe continues to say\n\n01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000\nThe line is closed\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nGo on\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nAnd I was like, fuck, he wasn't gonna let me in\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nThe story's gonna get\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nThere's more twists coming\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nI know it sounds you guys are like\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nHis mouth is getting dry, he's getting nervous\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nWe definitely did not think that\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nThis is why\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nYou heard a booming magical voice\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000\nOff camera say\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nLet that young man do as he pleases\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nLet that man balance the scales\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nHe was born in a country that may not\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nAlways keep its eye toward its dreams\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000\nAnd the camera swivels over\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nAnd it's Stephen Hawking\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nThe guy, I walked away\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nHaving been rejected, my Rick and Morty\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nCredibility, the only shred of what I have\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nWas not a currency I could use to meet John Lewis\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nRight, one second\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nDan, it's now a bad time to do our ad for me, Andes\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000\nCan I get to the\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nOkay, yes\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nWhen I ended the cliffhanger, I was not allowed to meet John Lewis\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nOh, yeah, that's great\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nNo, no, no, no, no, the cliffhanger, then there's gonna be a commercial\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nWhat could happen next?\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nWe'll have to find out\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nI hope that while Ryan was waiting in the exhibit hall\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nHe was wearing comfortable underwear\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nI mean, if you go to\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nTo a convention hall and you're wearing\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nLess than the most comfortable underwear\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nIn the world\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nI mean, you're\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nYour own worst enemy\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nBeing you\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nMan, lady, or\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nAny part of the continuum on which we exist\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nGender-wise\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nThat was close\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nThe slippery shark\n\n01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nYeah\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nHe's falling asleep\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nThat's a thing\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nBut I really could never get past the history channel thing\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nI always called it the history channel\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nJohn Lewis also has a new show on history, I guess\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nAs Dan Harmon, I end up in a lot of\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nSticky situations\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nBut my underwear\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nIs anything but\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nIt stays smooth\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000\nLike an 80s chamois\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nWhen I run my hand\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nAcross my fanny\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nIf you're listening from the United Kingdom\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nThat means\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nBut\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nI think it means vagina\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nI'm telling the British people\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nSorry\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nSorry\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nIn my soft, silky\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nSilky sounds like\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nLet me tell you about meundies\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nI want to explain\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nSomething to you that\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nYou may not have known\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nWe've been living in a marginalized\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nWorld\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nI'm not saying it's the matrix\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nWe don't know what's a simulation\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nAnd what isn't, but we do know that\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nIn reality, we are being marginalized\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nPoint\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nIf you drink\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000\n7-up\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nEvery time you experience anxiety\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nAnd it makes you feel better\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nYou're going to form an addiction to 7-up\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nYour neurology is going to form a relationship\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nWith the things that provide it comfort\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nAnd as time goes on\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nIt gets more and more complicated\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nIt comes a point when you don't know\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nIf what you're doing is what you want to do\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000\nWhat you need to do\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nYou won't even be able to tell the difference\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nFor those of you who have ever\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nKnown someone with an addiction\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nYou don't know whether you want\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nTo do something or whether you think\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nYou want to do something\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nMy point being that\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nLike\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nWhy did I go down that road?\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nYou're doing an advertising\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nYou were talking about your poopy underwears\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nWell\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nWait\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nIt should occur to you\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nThat oh my god\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nIf it's possible to have a weird relationship\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nWith video games\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nOr alcohol\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nOr a certain restaurant\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nWhere something becomes like a compulsion\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nAn addiction\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nCan you imagine the things that you're not being told\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nHave been baked into your neurology\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nBy a generation\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nThat was already raised in artifice\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000\nThat was here well before you got here\n\n01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nAnd was in charge of everything you ever saw or heard\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nYou can imagine the possibility therefore\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nThat it is\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nPossible for you to live on a limited\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nPlane of existence with absolutely\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nNo consciousness of what you could be\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nEnter me undies\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nWow\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nThe underwear company that stood back\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nAnd said what is underwear\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nLike why does it feel\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nThe way it feels\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nIn a sea of people I'm sure\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000\nThat no longer worked there\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nAnd said\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nIt's not that complicated bro\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nI'm a fucking sexist pig\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nI don't work at me undies\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nI'm a piece of shit\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nWhat's it matter bro\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nIf it ain't bro Ken don't fix it bro\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nI'm a bro\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nThat was beautiful\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nDon't bro\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nCan fix it bro\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nAnd me undies took those people\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nAnd they just put them in the airlock\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nAnd as their silent screams\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nFell on no ears but their own\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nThey were flushed into space\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nTheir body succumbed to the vacuum\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nThat pre-existed time\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nAnd they were dealt with the way God\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nDeals with\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nWith\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nYou know bros\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nAnd then the only people left\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nWhere people that\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nLive within a world where\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nUnderwear can be more comfortable\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nThan you thought possible\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nAre they promoting the show or something\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nMaybe, I guess\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nWe're promoting Dan\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nDon't be so cynical\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nDan's just passionate about his underwear\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nI love me undies, that's the only undies I wear\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nFor real?\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nIf you go to meundies.com\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nSlash feral audio\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nThat you get 20% off your first pair\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nAnd if you don't like them\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nHey, guess what\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nYou will\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nLet's say you're a stupid person\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nFrom an alien planet of stupid people\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nWho doesn't like the undies\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nMade out of the softest fabric\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nYou've ever had, they're free\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nYou get to keep them, you can do whatever you want with them\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nYou can wash your car with them\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nI love it, I love meundies\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nYou might be sold at me\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nI happen to wear meundies as well\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nAnd I'm not uncomfortable\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nTalking about their quality\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nI don't have to put my tongue in my cheek\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nBecause I'm not comfortable shilling\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nI'm more than comfortable shilling for meundies\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nI'm not putting my tongue in my cheek\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nThey're incredibly comfortable\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nModal fabric, look it up\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nModal?\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nIsn't as like\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nTwice as comfortable as regular underwear stuff\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nThat's the head of meundies\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nModal\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nModal\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nWait, are there meundies people in the audience?\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nDo we got any meundies?\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nThere's this whole audience\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nYou're wearing meundies, throw them up\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nI think a lot of these people are probably wearing meundies\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nBecause weird travels fast\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000\nWhen an undergarment is like\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nStepping into God's mouth\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nIs it\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nOnly your genitals\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nRyan, Alia, Dan\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nYou're all fans of meundies\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nIs it true that meundies was created by pirates?\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nPirates?\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000\nIt feels like they were\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nWhere's meundies?\n\n01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nFrom what I've read\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nYou get different information from different websites\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000\nBut it was a fabric\n\n01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nStolen from an old pirate chest\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nOne large piece of fabric\n\n01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000\nNot a lot of undies left\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nWell, it never runs out\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nA pirate chest\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nOkay\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nSo you finally made it\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nInto the last level of the EW party\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nLet me tell you something\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nThe last thing I'm going to say about meundies\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nWas the last thing\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000\n95% of my underwear is meundies\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nBecause I was like, fuck, get this shit out of the way\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nFucking hains in\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nI went to full 95%\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nEvery now and then there's laundry\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nWhy hang on to that other five?\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nBecause you never know\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nSomeone threw away underwear\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nYou can find out that meundies\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nThe company was all paid for by Nazi gold\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nYou don't know that\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nOr it's laced with mercury\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nThat's why it's so comfortable\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nActually, it's made out of healthy babies\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nI happen to not be wearing\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nMeundies right now\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nI'm wearing Calvin Klein's\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nYou're paying for it\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nBecause I wear meundies\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nOn nights\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nWhen I know there's going to be\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nAction\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nWell, sex?\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nGod damn it, sex\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000\nAfter your performance tonight\n\n01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nWe know that tonight is not one of those nights\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000\nAnd good\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000\nBecause I'm wearing Calvin Klein's tonight\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000\nBecause I wear the 5%\n\n01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nWhen I'm

special night\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nThey're soft, I would want to counter that\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nRyan, because I don't want to create an ad campaign\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nWhere people are like, oh\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nThese are my fuck underwear\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000\nThese are not, you don't\n\n01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nI\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nMeundies is when you just want to feel like\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nYou're fucking your underwear\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nThey're fine with that\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nI've heard their ad campaigns, they're absolutely fine with that\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nPeople associate\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nThe whole fucking thing\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nWith the opposite of comfort\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nLike, oh, I'm going to wear these shoes because they make my ass look good\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nBut that's not what I wear when I'm hanging out\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nOn a Sunday, I'm saying wear your meundies\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nAnd this is great for all occasions\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nLet these other podcasts\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nThat you're talking about\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000\nHow fuckable they are\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nI'd like to talk about how they're good for hanging out\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nAnd itching your butt\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000\nWhich is how you lead\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nInto sex\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000\n99% of the time I'm just hanging out\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nSo yeah\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nWhen you itch your butt in meundies\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nIt's like a doctor put on those clean sterile gloves\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nAnd like is itching\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nYour butt for you\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nBecause it's like a smooth\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nRidgeless finger\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nDan, when you put on a pair of meundies\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nDo you reflexively just start touching one of your nipples?\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nYeah\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nAt the comic con thing I talked about this\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000\nI went and got a testicular exam\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nAnd while the doctor was like\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nLike\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nFooling around\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nNot fooling around\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nI was fooling around\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nHe was hard at work\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000\nHe was doing this for his kids\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nHe wasn't like\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000\nHe didn't come up with this idea\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nI came in there\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nAnd just like check him\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nAnd then while he was doing it\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nI like caught myself\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nI rubbed my nipple\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nWith my thumb\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nTo make the most out of it\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nI was like\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nI caught myself doing it\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000\nAnd then he fixed my hair\n\n01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nHe's like\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nWouldn't be the first time\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nIt was really weird because I wasn't\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nTurned on that I know of\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nBut\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nI\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nScratching your butthole does lead to\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nYou know, excitement\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nI think in general\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nThis is a guy checking me\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nFor cancer in my balls\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nBut\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nCody, my girlfriend\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nWhen we were in Canada\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nHave you\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nTell me if I'm crying\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nHave you ever done the thing\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nDid you ever want to aim\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000\nA man's\n\n01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000\nWhile he's peeing\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000\nLike to aim it around\n\n01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nJust once\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000\nI've only been in a committed relationship once\n\n01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nThe only time I felt comfortable\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nTo ask for control\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000\nYou've only been in one committed relationship\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000\nAnd you took that opportunity to\n\n01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nAim as P\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nI think that's enough for me\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nMission accomplished\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nYou might be the last\n\n01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nHe checks it\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000\nEveryone's like\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000\nYou're\n\n01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000\nAre you okay?\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nHe wants to know\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nHe'd be so excited\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nTo see you\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nGet married\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000\nI thought I ruined her\n\n01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nWith my weird pee pee\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nNo, it wasn't that\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nI have asked to aim it\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000\nWe always wonder what it's like\n\n01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000\nWe did that one morning\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nHe let her\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nAim it\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000\nI think the next day\n\n01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nHe said\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nYou were touching your nipple\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nWhen I did that\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nI thought she was lying\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000\nWhy would I do that\n\n01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000\nIt wasn't a sexual thing\n\n01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000\nHow would you notice touching your nipple\n\n01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nNaturally put your hand up\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nI think it's got to be a comfort thing\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nIt's a security thing\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nI believe me\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nI'm all over this thing during sex\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nThe nipple\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nWhy is this happening\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nEither is fine\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nBut\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000\nAnyways\n\n01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000\nMeundies are comfortable\n\n01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000\nWe love meundies\n\n01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000\nIt's good\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nBut then I noticed it\n\n01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000\nIt's worth noting\n\n01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nFade up on the floor of Comic-Con\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nWhere we last left our intrepid hero\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nHe was trying to John Lewis\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nThe civil rights activist\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000\nAutograph\n\n01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000\nBut he couldn't\n\n01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000\nBy lording over the fact\n\n01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000\nThat he worked on the amazing show\n\n01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nRick and Morty\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nThank you\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000\nSo as he was walking away\n\n01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000\nI said I get a tap in my shoulder\n\n01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000\nRyan come here\n\n01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000\nOkay\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nMr. Lewis we got one more guy\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nCan you please\n\n01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000\nThis is the guy who controls the line\n\n01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000\nThe gatekeeper\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nI think his heart\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nYeah exactly\n\n01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000\nHe looked at my gate\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000\nHe got me\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000\nYou guys certainly would not have done this for me\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000\nTrust me\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nHe's like I feel bad for that guy\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000\nHe's clearly got some fucking problems\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nSo he goes come here\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000\nTakes me over to John Lewis\n\n01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000\nLook him in the eye shake his hand\n\n01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nThank you so much for everything you've done\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000\nHe goes just trying to make the world a better place\n\n01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000\nHe didn't really say that I had to punch up his line\n\n01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000\nI swear it was the essence of that\n\n01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000\nHe was like so what show are you working on\n\n01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000\nHe said like some crazy anti-semitic thing\n\n01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000\nYou're like really protecting this guy\n\n01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000\nHe just launched\n\n01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000\nHe wasn't even John Lewis\n\n01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000\nSo I go\n\n01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000\nThat was amazing\n\n01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000\nIt really was I walked away\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000\nI'm being completely sincere I'm going to drop this character I'm doing\n\n01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nI mean that was amazing I was buzzing inside\n\n01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000\nIt felt great I shook\n\n01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000\nThe hand of a man who shook the hand of Martin Luther King Jr\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nMarched in Selma\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000\nAll that stuff\n\n01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000\nThis is the highlight of Comic Con\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000\nFuck the EW party fuck the Game of Thrones shit\n\n01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000\nSo I think\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nThat guy he hooked me up he did me a favor\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000\nHe knew who I was\n\n01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000\nHe saw my name and he must know the show\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000\nSo I go and we do a signing\n\n01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000\nAnd I say to Justin\n\n01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000\nCan you write on this card that we're signing\n\n01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nFor everybody it's a picture from the show\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000\nCan you just write\n\n01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000\nThank you for letting Ryan meet John Lewis\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000\nJustin Orlin\n\n01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000\nYou got this photo\n\n01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nYou were going to find this guy to give it to him\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nThank you Alia\n\n01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000\nI think you're finding out\n\n01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000\nIt's Alia\n\n01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000\nNicaragua\n\n01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000\nI'm not going to get too real by that\n\n01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000\nNicaragua\n\n01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000\nSo I get the card signed by Justin\n\n01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000\nFight my way back\n\n01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000\nThrough the madness that is the convention floor\n\n01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000\nTakes me 40 minutes to get from\n\n01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000\nWhatever one end of the other\n\n01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000\nFull of Hollywood elites\n\n01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000\nHe doesn't care anymore\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000\nBut now he doesn't care now he just sees them as green letters\n\n01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000\nHe's like\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000\nJenny McBride is just a pie symbol\n\n01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000\nWho's cascading like a waterfall\n\n01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000\nHe's like hey you want to hang out\n\n01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000\nHe's like no I don't care about your hands\n\n01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000\nJoss Whedon Joss Hooten\n\n01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000\nI rift that\n\n01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000\nSo\n\n01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000\nWait Dan you didn't stay at home all night\n\n01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000\nWriting that joke\n\n01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nYou got that in your pocket\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000\nI did not have that in my pocket\n\n01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000\nI was much too highly crafted\n\n01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000\nBut you can just\n\n01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000\nRift number 14\n\n01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000\nYou're working your way through the crowd\n\n01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000\nWith this delicately signed\n\n01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000\nPhoto in the air\n\n01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000\nThe great Justin Roiland\n\n01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000\nAnd by the way\n\n01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000\nI have to throw my bosses under the bus all the time\n\n01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000\nBecause I'm insecure\n\n01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000\nSo I go to the convention floor\n\n01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000\nAnd I go back to the booth\n\n01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000\nAnd I don't see this guy\n\n01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000\nNow I know what he looks like\n\n01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000\nAlso how many hours later is this\n\n01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000\nNo wonder he's not there\n\n01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000\nHe was working the booth all day\n\n01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000\nThese aren't the Hollywood elites\n\n01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000\nThey don't just come and go\n\n01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000\nFlights of fancy oh it's the next hot party\n\n01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000\nThey're fucking working\n\n01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000\nJohn Lewis probably has a lot of shit to do\n\n01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000\nNo no, not John Lewis the guy who helped me get the\n\n01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000\nWhy is he like\n\n01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000\nHe wrote a graphic novel\n\n01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000\nHe wrote a graphic novel called March\n\n01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000\nAbout his history doing the civil rights movement\n\n01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000\nHe wrote it?\n\n01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000\nHe wrote some other people\n\n01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000\nHe wrote most of it\n\n01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000\nGraphic novel\n\n01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000\nThat's what I got signed\n\n01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000\nI got a signed copy\n\n01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000\nBut get your own\n\n01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000\nI like graphic novelizations of stuff that I would never\n\n01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000\nYou know\n\n01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000\nLike that mouse thing\n\n01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000\nOr there was like\n\n01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000\nBiographies of Freud and stuff\n\n01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000\nThat I've looked at that were in comic book form\n\n01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000\nI'm probably not going to read it\n\n01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000\nBut I got it signed by John Lewis\n\n01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000\nAnyway the point is I go to the booth\n\n01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000\nAnd I can't see the guy\n\n01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000\nBut I know what he looks like\n\n01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000\nLike I really want to give him to this\n\n01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000\nAnd move on, I got other\n\n01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000\nSo I'm like I can't see him\n\n01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000\nSo finally I go to somebody works at the booth\n\n01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000\nAnd I go hey so I explain the whole story\n\n01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000\nI go this guy I don't know what his name is\n\n01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000\nBut he hooked me up with John Lewis's signature\n\n01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000\nAnd like I think he likes the show\n\n01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000\nI work on I got him this and so\n\n01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000\nI don't know who he is but\n\n01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000\nHe's a bigger guy\n\n01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000\nWith glasses\n\n01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000\nAnd she looks me in the eye\n\n01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000\nAnd she goes I don't know who you're talking about\n\n01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000\nI go\n\n01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000\nHe's a guy with glasses\n\n01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000\nA little bit bigger\n\n01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000\nYou mean Joel\n\n01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000\nThe shorter guy\n\n01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000\nWas this guy black?\n\n01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000\nNo\n\n01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000\nThat's what I was thinking\n\n01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000\nNo\n\n01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000\nThis is the key moment of the story\n\n01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000\nI was trying to say\n\n01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000\nHe was big, he had glasses\n\n01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000\nI didn't know his name\n\n01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000\nShe goes maybe Joel\n\n01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000\nBut he's the shorter guy\n\n01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000\nDoes anyone know what's going on here with this woman\n\n01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000\nWhat she's doing? She's shaming me\n\n01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000\nBecause I described him as the bigger guy\n\n01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000\nWe need to know though\n\n01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000\nSomething that only you know right now\n\n01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000\nAnd she\n\n01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000\nWhen you say bigger\n\n01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000\nDescribe tell us the description of this guy\n\n01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000\nBecause we don't know if he's nine feet tall or not\n\n01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000\nHe's nine feet tall\n\n01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000\nYou meant fat\n\n01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000\nHe was stocky\n\n01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000\nI don't know he was physically bigger\n\n01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000\nI didn't know what else to say\n\n01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000\nThat was it\n\n01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000\nHe was a white guy with glasses\n\n01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000\nI didn't know what else to say\n\n01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000\nYou just described 80% of the people a Comic Con\n\n01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000\nHow many of them are working at this booth\n\n01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000\nBut she looked at me\n\n01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000\nShe goes you mean the shorter guy\n\n01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000\nThe shorter guy\n\n01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000\nSo it's okay to call him the shorter guy\n\n01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000\nThat's the correct dimension\n\n01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000\nTo focus on\n\n01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000\nShe's like sir I'm just trying to help you spine this guy\n\n01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nHeight is cool\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000\nHeight is cool but I can't\n\n01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000\nRight?\n\n01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000\nIt's my pet peeve when people tell me\n\n01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000\nI'm over thinking or I'm projecting it to my head\n\n01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000\nBut you\n\n01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000\nI really think that you're\n\n01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000\nI believe that what you\n\n01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000\nThe piece that you're missing is that she is actually\n\n01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000\nShe knows six\n\n01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000\nPeople\n\n01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000\nAnd you said bigger\n\n01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000\nAnd she said\n\n01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000\nShe was diplomatic\n\n01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000\nShe means tall big\n\n01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000\nBy bigger do you mean the fat one\n\n01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000\nShe was just skirting the issue\n\n01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000\nDan do you not think I know when people\n\n01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000\nDon't like me\n\n01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000\nShe was\n\n01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000\nLooking me in the eye and saying the words\n\n01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000\nYou mean the shorter one\n\n01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000\nTrust me\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000\nWhy would I tell this story\n\n01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000\nIf it was like I knew\n\n01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000\nThere was ten percent of a chance that I'm this delusional maniac\n\n01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000\nOf Tarantino and Dustle Don\n\n01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000\nI see Juliette Lewis saying\n\n01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000\nEat my pussy and I, that's not really what she said\n\n01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000\nShe said something else, yes she was shaming me\n\n01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000\nI still don't think James Cameron saw you yell about hot dogs\n\n01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000\nThat's the point of delusions\n\n01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000\nIs that you don't know\n\n01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000\nAlso I bet all of you know\n\n01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000\nThis is all going on in your head and she's like showing you pictures\n\n01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000\nShe's like this guy this guy and you're like\n\n01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000\nShe thinks I'm crazy she thinks I'm this\n\n01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000\nAnd then she's like hello anybody\n\n01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000\nAlright well here he is\n\n01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000\nAll I'm saying is\n\n01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000\nIf I knew three guys\n\n01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000\nAnd one was tall and skinny\n\n01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000\nAnd one was short and fat\n\n01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000\nAnd one was tall and bigger\n\n01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000\nAll around\n\n01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000\nAnd you were trying to\n\n01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000\nSomeone said the bigger guy\n\n01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000\nI think the tall guy\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000\nKnowing me with my foot in my mouth I go the fat one\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000\nI don't know but I'm saying\n\n01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000\nGiven that situation\n\n01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000\nThe best like most courteous way of\n\n01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000\nThat's all I'm saying\n\n01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000\nBut I think\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000\nI will believe you\n\n01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000\nIf you simply tell me\n\n01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nBecause you just keep saying she's saying the shorter one\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000\nBut what I want to hear from you is\n\n01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000\nYou're saying regardless of her words\n\n01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000\nIt was very clear from her face\n\n01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000\nVery clear\n\n01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nJudging you\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000\nAs clear as she was\n\n01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000\nGirl\n\n01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000\nHow dare you\n\n01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000\nYou're not using that language\n\n01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000\nYou're not so sensitive about it\n\n01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000\nIt's like well look different it's okay\n\n01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000\nThank you that's the point of the\n\n01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000\nHigh five finally\n\n01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000\nI'm not going to ask for a high five from any of you\n\n01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000\nBecause you're still like who the fuck is this guy\n\n01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000\nAlso they're far away\n\n01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000\nIt would be awkward\n\n01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:15.000\nWas she dress slutty?\n\n01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000\nI was just trying to trick him\n\n01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000\nWhile we have him like placid\n\n01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000\nLike he'd be like yeah she was dress slutty\n\n01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000\nActually yeah she was just like okay\n\n01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000\nYou got me\n\n01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000\nLike you don't know what's right and what's wrong\n\n01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000\nI'm just reprogramming you\n\n01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000\nListen the arc of the story if we've all forgotten\n\n01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000\nIs I meet a civil rights hero\n\n01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000\nI decided to do the guy of favor\n\n01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000\nWho hooked me up with that\n\n01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000\nYou're xenophobic\n\n01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000\nBut I mean\n\n01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000\nYou came back looking for a big old fatty\n\n01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000\nThere were two guys who worked at the booth\n\n01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000\nAnd they were both five foot two\n\n01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000\nWhat do you mean the shorter one\n\n01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000\nWhat happened from letter\n\n01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000\nDid you let that stop you?\n\n01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000\nOf course not\n\n01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000\nJust like I'm not going to let any of this stop me\n\n01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000\nTelling the story\n\n01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000\nNot even our 30 minute me and these commercial\n\n01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000\nCould stop the story\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000\nSo finally she says\n\n01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000\nYou mean\n\n01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000\nThe shorter one and I just go\n\n01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000\nYeah the fucking shorter one\n\n01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000\nShe goes that's Joel he's right over there\n\n01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000\nI'm like there he is that big fucking fat\n\n01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000\nMotherfucker\n\n01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000\nTake that goddamn soft pretzel out of your hand\n\n01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000\nAnd take this Rick and Morty signed fucking postcard\n\n01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000\nGod damn pig thank you for letting me be John Lewis\n\n01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000\nI've been Ryan Ridley goodnight\n\n01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000\nDid he\n\n01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000\nDid he\n\n01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000\nReceive it\n\n01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000\nAs well as his weird\n\n01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000\nInteresting\n\n01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000\nSpectromy whatever you would describe yourself\n\n01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000\nKind of liking me not liking me\n\n01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000\nAll that shit\n\n01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000\nBut stuff you always talk about yourself\n\n01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000\nHe was like you\n\n01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000\nI didn't know if he liked me or didn't like me\n\n01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000\nWas he thankful for\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nHe was like thank you very much\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000\nDid we ever find out if he actually was a Rick and Morty fan\n\n01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000\nWell he said he saw my name\n\n01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000\nAnd if you're not a Rick and Morty fan\n\n01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000\nWell I would interpret that as look\n\n01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000\nIf there was anything worth knowing about\n\n01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000\nYou'd be on your fucking lacquer\n\n01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000\nHe's literally just being like I see what's written on your lacquer\n\n01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000\nYeah exactly you don't have to waste my fucking\n\n01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000\nTime with this shit\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000\nI've been reading lacquers all day\n\n01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000\nI live within hierarchy I know how\n\n01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000\nYou're wearing a resume on your chest\n\n01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000\nI know how human chess works\n\n01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000\nI know you're a bishop I get it\n\n01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000\nCan I say the only part of regret about this entire night\n\n01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000\nIs the way I described him\n\n01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000\nHe was very nice he wasn't what I was saying\n\n01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000\nI'm saying that because I'm repeating what Dan\n\n01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000\nIs always saying in the writer's room\n\n01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000\nDo you mean the spectromy part\n\n01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000\nYeah all that stuff you're always saying that stuff\n\n01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000\nAnd it's gotten in my head I'm just like spouting it off\n\n01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000\nYou know I learned from watching you\n\n01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000\nSo I'm very sorry to everybody in their audience\n\n01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000\nEverybody watching he received it well\n\n01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000\nHe was very nice you know\n\n01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000\nHe was a little weird\n\n01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000\nBut what do you want me to say at this point\n\n01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000\nI honestly didn't know\n\n01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000\nWhat was your problem\n\n01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000\nI don't\n\n01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000\nI don't want to say he was fat\n\n01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000\nBut when he walked around\n\n01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000\nThe conventions that are\n\n01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000\nHe walked around\n\n01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000\nIn comparison to\n\n01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000\nAlia\n\n01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000\nAlia\n\n01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000\nI'm trying different shit out\n\n01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000\nComedy comes in threes when there's a vowel\n\n01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000\nIt's pronounced three ways\n\n01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000\nIs there anything we talked about\n\n01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000\nYou're like we're looking forward\n\n01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000\nTo it on TBS no longer very funny\n\n01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000\nJust TBS\n\n01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000\nLook the\n\n01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000\nGod damn it I already forgot\n\n01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000\nThe fucking cock fucking shit name\n\n01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000\nSearch party\n\n01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000\nGod damn it\n\n01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000\nWhy can't you name it Pokemon\n\n01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000\nSo I can remember\n\n01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000\nIs that still valuable anymore\n\n01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000\nIs it like over now\n\n01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000\nLike a rare super spike\n\n01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000\nBecause it was like holy shit\n\n01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000\nAnd then with all the fires\n\n01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000\nThe world's about to end\n\n01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000\nEverything's happening so quickly\n\n01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000\nRising and falling within one breath\n\n01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000\nIt's almost like it was a symptom\n\n01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000\nOf that level of\n\n01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000\nHeightness itself\n\n01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000\nMy therapist says\n\n01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000\nYou're up at that setting\n\n01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000\nThat was the only environment in which\n\n01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000\nThis Pokemon thing could have like\n\n01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000\nEither it's because we wanted a distraction\n\n01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000\nOr it's because\n\n01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000\nWe were just so fucking amped up\n\n01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000\nAnd that game was about being kind of\n\n01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000\nI'm not saying it was random\n\n01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000\nLike it would have been about toothpicks\n\n01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000\nI mean it was obviously a game that had its\n\n01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000\nBut it's also people who have the memory of it too\n\n01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000\nLike the young people now knowing\n\n01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000\nBut it's like an overnight now it's done\n\n01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000\nIt was like five articles a day\n\n01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000\nIt's already crescendoed\n\n01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000\nIt's already crescendoed\n\n01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000\nIs there one up here right now\n\n01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000\nOh this is a joke\n\n01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000\nThis is crawling within a ran\n\n01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000\nThis comic book story\n\n01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000\nIs more Jim than it will ever be\n\n01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000\nWhere's my red team at\n\n01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000\nFuck you guys\n\n01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000\nI don't play it\n\n01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000\nI'm kidding\n\n01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000\nBlue\n\n01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000\nYellow\n\n01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000\nGreen\n\n01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000\nOne dude\n\n01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000\nSo we have to take to the streets of Donald Trump becomes president\n\n01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000\nThese teams will be the fighting forces\n\n01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000\nOkay\n\n01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000\nSo really remember your colors\n\n01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000\nYou will have to fight\n\n01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000\nSpencer you guys are saying\n\n01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000\nYou feel like this has run its course\n\n01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000\nI'm only talking about the press\n\n01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000\nThat's all\n\n01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000\nMy friend told me about it at dinner\n\n01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000\nHe was like you hear about this Pokemon thing\n\n01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000\nAnd I was like no what are you talking about\n\n01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000\nLiterally within moments every 20 minutes\n\n01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000\nMore and more people like exponentially\n\n01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000\nThat's the thing it's all exponentially growing\n\n01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000\nI was just talking about the news cycle\n\n01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000\nLike it was a quarter\n\n01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000\nOf all press\n\n01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000\nUsually if something like that happens\n\n01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000\nThere's a little more of a bell curve\n\n01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000\nThere's money here\n\n01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000\nYou know you ring it dry\n\n01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000\nBut this was just like\n\n01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000\nThere's a shit fuck ton of money for two days here\n\n01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000\nFor the press and then it was like\n\n01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000\nFuckin' Trump\n\n01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000\nThey just like fucking spasm\n\n01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000\nAbout Pokemon and it peaked\n\n01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000\nLiterally there was a headline that says\n\n01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000\nTrump says he hasn't played Pokemon yet\n\n01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000\nHere's the article that was marked\n\n01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000\nThe spearhead of that stalagmite\n\n01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000\nIt was like shot up through the roof\n\n01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000\nOf the cave into God's eye\n\n01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000\nLike Trump hasn't\n\n01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000\nPlayed Pokemon yet\n\n01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000\nNew York Times\n\n01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000\nAnd people were just like\n\n01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000\nBecause there was the article about how they were playing it\n\n01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000\nTo the Holocaust Museum was asking\n\n01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000\nLike look\n\n01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000\nI'm not one of these this isn't news\n\n01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000\nPeople like that in all the comment sections\n\n01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000\nDude why is this news\n\n01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000\nYour dumb is why\n\n01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000\nWhy is the comment section your blog\n\n01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000\nBecause you're fucking stupid that's why this is news\n\n01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000\nYou fucking parasite\n\n01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000\nLike stop comment\n\n01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000\nWhy would you log in\n\n01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000\nYou need an account to say\n\n01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000\nWhy is this news\n\n01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000\nDo something about it\n\n01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000\nWith wheat paste\n\n01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000\nOr a bottle or something\n\n01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000\nMake a gas mask out of it\n\n01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000\nGet visceral about it\n\n01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000\nDid you say visceral\n\n01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000\nGet visceral\n\n01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000\nI've been feeding you already\n\n01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000\nWe have a 20 year confession to make\n\n01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000\nAbout what we've been doing\n\n01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000\nWhy we've never been on stage at the same time\n\n01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000\nShe's your serenity\n\n01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000\nEllie has been piloting me\n\n01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000\nLike in the 80's\n\n01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000\nWhen there was that monkey that could\n\n01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000\nDrive a car and it was the trainer\n\n01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000\nWas driving it while laying down\n\n01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000\nYou mean an huge revolution\n\n01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000\nYeah I think they had to do those\n\n01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000\nEffects they did\n\n01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000\nAnyways let's wrap this up\n\n01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000\nWhat was I talking about\n\n01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000\nStay on target\n\n01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000\nI was talking about Pokemon\n\n01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000\nThe Holocaust Museum piece\n\n01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000\nThe last paragraph of the\n\n01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000\nArticle\n\n01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000\nWhy is this news\n\n01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000\nThe truth is if you just put cell phones\n\n01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000\nIn place of any of those articles\n\n01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000\nThat's all it was\n\n01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000\nWoman gets carjacked while playing Pokemon\n\n01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000\nShe was using her cell phone\n\n01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000\nShe was playing Pokemon\n\n01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000\nIt was just ubiquity\n\n01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000\nThat's\n\n01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000\nYou're clicking on these articles\n\n01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000\nLike oh Pokemon is so important\n\n01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000\nAnd the cause of people killing themselves\n\n01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000\nIt's like no everyone's doing it with their phones\n\n01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000\nBefore that\n\n01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000\nGuy uses Instagram before he\n\n01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000\nLike joins a race gang\n\n01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000\nRight\n\n01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000\nIt just wasn't news because it wasn't\n\n01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000\nBut do you think it's Pokemon\n\n01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000\nThe reason why people\n\n01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000\nLike is because it does physically\n\n01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000\nMake you look for things\n\n01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000\nYou're actually walking around\n\n01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000\nSo the Holocaust Museum said\n\n01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000\nPlease just can you\n\n01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000\nNot Pokemon while you're looking at the piles\n\n01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000\nWe're trying\n\n01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000\nThere's something for sale here and it's not\n\n01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000\nDo you think the Holocaust Museum is\n\n01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000\nNot what you're buying\n\n01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000\nDo you think the Holocaust Museum is like a gym or a poke stop\n\n01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000\nIt was a poke stop because they were like\n\n01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000\nThey use landmarks and stuff and there's only so many landmarks\n\n01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000\nThat would bother to say can you please not\n\n01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000\nHave Jesus Christ\n\n01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000\nYou know who didn't have any problem\n\n01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000\nThe Tolerance Museum\n\n01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000\nWhat is that by the way\n\n01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000\nJeff I should clarify\n\n01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000\nThis isn't the Holocaust Museum\n\n01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000\nThat loves Holocaust\n\n01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000\nI think it is a form of\n\n01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000\nTolerance Museum\n\n01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000\nI don't know how many Holocaust Museums\n\n01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000\nAre there like\n\n01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000\nA simpler time\n\n01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000\nJoin me\n\n01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000\nWon't you\n\n01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000\nI'm Harry Holocaust\n\n01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000\nWe don't agree with everything that happened back then\n\n01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000\nWe're just saying\n\n01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000\nPeople had lemonade\n\n01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000\nLike take a trip back\n\n01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000\nWith us and it's all like there's T-shirts\n\n01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000\nNo it was a\n\n01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000\nIt's the Holocaust Museum\n\n01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000\nSo the article is just\n\n01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000\nIt's a non-news piece because it's just like\n\n01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000\nThey're just going can we not be a poke stop\n\n01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000\nLike obviously we shouldn't be a poke stop\n\n01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000\nBecause there's people there's Nitterans\n\n01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000\nThere's people running and they're going like\n\n01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000\nAnd so the only article was just like\n\n01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000\nThey're asking you to please not do that\n\n01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000\nBut then I know\n\n01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000\nI know it was a fake quote it had to be a fake\n\n01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000\nQuote because the last paragraph was\n\n01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000\nIt's not like\n\n01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000\nWe came here to play the game\n\n01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000\nSays Annie 37\n\n01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000\nOr something I can't remember her name\n\n01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000\nI remember the age was 37 because it just sounds like a fake age\n\n01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000\nIt sounds like they're like we don't want it to be\n\n01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000\nLike it just sounds fake\n\n01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000\nWhose name is withheld because\n\n01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000\nShe didn't want a bit so it's like fake fake fake fake\n\n01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000\nAnd then it's like the last like she goes\n\n01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000\nBecause it's continuing her quote\n\n01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000\nIt's not like we came here to play the game\n\n01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000\nSays Annie something 37\n\n01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000\nWho withheld her last name\n\n01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000\nBut gotta catch them all\n\n01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000\nAnd it was like\n\n01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000\nCome on so fake\n\n01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000\nAll of these headlines or all these articles\n\n01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000\nAbout Pokemon Go are coming out as fake too\n\n01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000\nYou know they already did like\n\n01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000\nAll the craziest ones\n\n01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000\nThey did like you know how they have those ads\n\n01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000\nTesting\n\n01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000\nThey already have a Pokemon one like\n\n01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000\nWe're gonna catch them all about\n\n01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000\nSTDs and I was like\n\n01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000\nThey just made it\n\n01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000\nMy girlfriend and I watched porn together\n\n01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000\nWe're at Comic Con\n\n01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000\nWe're like oh my god there must be like 70\n\n01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000\nPokemon ponds already\n\n01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000\nBecause there's like ones where\n\n01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000\nI've seen The Simpsons Ponds\n\n01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000\nThey're like covered in makeup\n\n01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000\nBut there's like\n\n01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000\nThere's a guy on a hoverboard\n\n01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000\nAnd it's like\n\n01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000\nWhen hoverboards became big enough\n\n01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000\nThat there was a cuckold video\n\n01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000\nAnd you know what cuckold porn is\n\n01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000\nCuckold porn is like guys\n\n01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000\nLike maybe I shouldn't limit it to gender\n\n01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000\nBut I think it's traditionally a guy\n\n01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000\nWho is getting fucked around on\n\n01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000\nEither he's into it or he's not\n\n01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000\nHe's fucked around on\n\n01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000\nHe has to watch\n\n01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000\nAnd he can't do anything about it\n\n01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000\nBecause his dick is smaller\n\n01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000\nAnd he's on a hoverboard\n\n01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000\nAnd he comes into the porn scene\n\n01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000\nAnd he goes like\n\n01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000\nI got a hoverboard\n\n01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000\nAnd he's got a helmet on\n\n01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000\nBut later on\n\n01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000\nHe'll be naked on the hoverboard\n\n02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000\nWatching his wife fuck another guy\n\n02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000\nThe guy that sold him the hoverboard\n\n02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000\nAnd just kind of going like\n\n02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000\nHe's like wheeling around the room\n\n02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000\nYou have to find this video\n\n02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000\nI thought we already talked about this\n\n02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000\nBecause this guy is like a master\n\n02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000\nYou watch a man control a scene\n\n02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000\nFrom the lowest status position\n\n02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000\nIt's bad cuckold porn because\n\n02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000\nHe's running the fucking show\n\n02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000\nBecause he's like a robot man\n\n02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000\nAnd the other two can't stop laughing\n\n02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000\nAnd they're freaking out\n\n02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000\nThis guy's unpredictable\n\n02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000\nHe loves being naked on a hoverboard\n\n02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000\nWatching me fuck his wife\n\n02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000\nLike I am not the bigger man here\n\n02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000\nHe's like I do love him\n\n02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000\nIt's unmistakable that\n\n02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000\nEvery\n\n02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000\nFigurative cock that's worth anything\n\n02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000\nIs his to wield\n\n02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000\nAnd I am left with only\n\n02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000\nThis absolutely vestigial\n\n02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000\nRedundant meat tube\n\n02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000\nWhich happens to be\n\n02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000\nCosmetically larger diameter\n\n02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000\nBut is absolutely powerless\n\n02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000\nIn every way\n\n02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000\nThis guy's a star\n\n02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000\nThat's what technology does\n\n02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000\nIt makes us doubt what we're born with\n\n02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000\nWho did you meet for in Rain Man?\n\n02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000\nTom Cruise? He loved Dustin Hoffman\n\n02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000\nHe's like wheeling around the room\n\n02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000\nGoing like\n\n02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000\nHe's like I don't need just

balls\n\n02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000\nHow do you play licking another guy's balls\n\n02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000\nBecause your wife told you to\n\n02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000\nHow do you play that high status\n\n02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000\nYou don't but if you play it\n\n02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000\nIf you love licking those balls\n\n02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000\nAnd you don't give a fuck about human life\n\n02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000\nIt just seems like he's like\n\n02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000\nHe just seems like\n\n02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000\nHe seems

02:01:49.000\nHe's like this is power\n\n02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000\nHow is he reacting to all of this\n\n02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000\nHe licks the balls\n\n02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000\nAnd he like stares with dead eyes\n\n02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000\nAt his wife\n\n02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000\nAnd it's like\n\n02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000\nHe just feels his gaze go through the back of her head\n\n02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000\nAnd she's like\n\n02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000\nShe just finished telling him to lick another guy's balls\n\n02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000\nSo that she could pay for his hoverboard\n\n02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000\nBut she's just unseen\n\n02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000\nYeah well she's\n\n02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000\nHe couldn't pay for the hoverboard\n\n02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000\nIt's a tee up for a cuckold porn\n\n02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000\nHoney I got this cuckold\n\n02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000\nAnd the guy that sold him the
