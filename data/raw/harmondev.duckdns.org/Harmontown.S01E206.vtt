WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Music

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Hollywood, California

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Meltdown Comics

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
The Nerdfeld Leader

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Harmontown is now in session

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Music

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Oh yeah

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Music

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Spencer Crittenden in here

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Do we have a Spencer?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Spencer in

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Music

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
There he is

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Music

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Bounding across the stage

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Like a mountain goat

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Music

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Mr. Dan Harmon

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
Music

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Thank you

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
You

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Um

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Let's just have a sleepy show

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Music

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
It's been a long weekend

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
It was Comic Con weekend

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
How many of you were in San Diego this weekend?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Applause

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
It was a long haul

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
And a very enjoyable one

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
We've got

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
We learned a lot

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
You had a busy docket too

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
You were all over the shop

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yup

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Um

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Did you get some business done?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Did you make some deals?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Yeah

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah man

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm good man

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Uh

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Let's get

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
We're just trying to figure out what business

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
To get out of the way

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Um

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
We have a guest tonight

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
We're going to chat

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Chat with her

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Um

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Ryan Ridley's also going to join us in a bit

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yup

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
The Riddler

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Uh

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
You know

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
The only things that are going on are

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Look

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Do you see the

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I didn't talk about this last night

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Did I

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
On Friday

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
The Trump ad

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Is it his own people that made that?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
The one that has the statistics

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
46 minutes of speech

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
22 minutes of applause

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
It was like

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
It was like stats about how great his speech went

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
It was so weird

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
He's a 16 year old girl

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Going like

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
3 pounds of birthday cake

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
3 candles per

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Square inch of frosting

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
It's your birthday you dumb fuck

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
It's what happens

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
No one has to love you in order for that to happen

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
You know Dan

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
You're going to have a fucking Republican convention

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Talking about being president

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
The only alternative is a Democrat

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
They're there to cheer you

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Dip shit

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
That doesn't mean you did something right

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
I think you come down on Trump a little too hard sometimes

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Let the man have a chance

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Let him talk

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Let him talk

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
He took the Washington Post's press credentials away

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
You can't follow me around anymore

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Because you always say mean things

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
That's the newspaper

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
They're totally anti-Trump

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Every headline is like

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
He's a piece of shit

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
And here's why

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
But he is a piece of shit

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
And then also

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Because he complained about it

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
They said

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Why don't you come in

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Because he kept talking about how they edit the articles

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Or they misrepresent things

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
So they brought him in

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
And just sat him down

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
And they published the entire transcript

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Then he's

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Guess what

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
He's a fucking dumbass

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Like it was like a three hour transcript of them

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Just going like

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Like what do you think of Nixon

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Nixon was great

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Nixon was good

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
He made some mistakes

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
But Nixon was a president

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
He was a huge president

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Okay what about Abe Lincoln

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Abe Lincoln

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Abe you know

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Great great president

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Truly great president

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Alright

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
But you guys can hear about all about that

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
He's gonna win

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I got a fucking feeling

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
He's gonna win

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
I'm not a pessimist

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
I don't want him to

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I just feel like

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
We didn't think he was gonna get this far

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
And he's gonna ride that wave

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
All the way into the beach

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Which is us all dying

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Or will he ride a Russian conspiracy

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
To get him elected into the beach

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
What's the deal with that man

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
What the fuck are you talking about

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
We hear that the Russians are the hackers

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
That leaked all this DNC shit

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
It's pretty crazy man

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
And WikiLeaks loves Milo Yiannopoulos

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
All of a sudden

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Some crazy world shit man

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
So there's this gay guy

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
He's like a republican gay guy

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm gonna stop you right there

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm gonna stop you there

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
He's like a pro Trump guy

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
So the campuses are turning

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Like there's little Trump heads

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
On the campuses

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Because how else are you gonna rebel now

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
They just want to worry people

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
That's their job, they're young

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
And they're really fond of this guy

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I mean this is them cracking the code

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Or rather the code is cracking them

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Because they love a gay guy

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Like we win

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
There's a certain respect

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
That's all we wanted

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Like they can see that this guy is gay

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
And also a human being that they love

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
But they love him

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Because he says all kinds of fucked up shit

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
And if you complain back

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Then you're homophobic

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
It's pretty, it's kind of fun

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
We're all six years old

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
It's easy to follow politics now

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Because it's like just

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Tabitha hit someone with a toy truck

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Like it's not that hard to

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Like you used to have to know

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
What a majority whip was

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I couldn't get through one episode

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Of House of Cards

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I'm like I don't know what the fuck a whip is

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Stop telling me about the whip

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
How can a show where the guy talks

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
To the camera be this confusing

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Dan Harmon really

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
That was me, I was the worst Kevin Spacey

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I just started watching that

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
It's a good show

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Well Jeff I'm glad you like that show

06:23.000 --> 06:30.000
I'm not glad Jeff likes that show

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
But if I tell him I am

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Well in about two terms

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
He'll flip like a labradoodle

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
At an Othello party

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
Oh Dan Harmon

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm about to do the Harmon on Dan

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Alright well let's bring out our new friend

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I mean really she should be an old friend

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I'm sure she is to many of you

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
She played maybe on Arrested Development

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
The rest of her resume is like

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
She clearly, she's probably

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Someone hip enough to not mind being called hip

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
She's definitely a presence in the hip

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
The hip pocket of comedy

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
She's deputy chief of staff on Trump's campaign

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
But I ran into her at the up front

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
The Turner cable up front

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
So let's make friends with her

07:23.000 --> 07:40.000
Shaw Cat is here

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
I just had this crazy panic as I was introducing you

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Because I thought

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Have I only seen her name in print

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Have I ever said it out loud in front of her

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Say it again to me but like in my eyes

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Alia Shaw Cat

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
It's pretty close

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I say Alia

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Alia

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
You can say Alia

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
That's the first time I went Alia

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah it's okay

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
So there is a panic struck with a lot of people

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Is this a boa thing you have going on?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Is this part of the top?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
No it's detachable

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Oh yeah

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I'm hip

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I'm really hip

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah you know it's hot

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
But sometimes you get a little cold around the neck

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I'm gonna make myself a

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Straight up vodka drink if that's okay

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah yeah

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
You're not getting any flak from the

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Elmo for industry people are you?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
No me and Elmo had a thing so

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Is that what color Elmo is?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
She's wearing a fur thing for those of you

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Listening in audio

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Alright some of these people don't understand

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm wearing Elmo around my neck

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Alright so

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Let's talk about when I was

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
At Turner

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
You were

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
What a weird thing that was by the way right?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Yeah well what's really weird is how funny

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Conan O'Brien, Anderson Cooper

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
And Charles Barkley are as a

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Three man comedy team

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Like they really tore the place up

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
It was great cause like

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Conan O'Brien and Charles Barkley

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Started doing these basketball jokes

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
About yeah well I'm taller than you

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Barkley was just shooting stuff off the hip

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
No pun intended I mean he was just like

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
He's funny he's actually

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
He was really funny

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Straight up funny

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
But then right on schedule Anderson Cooper

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Right as I was thinking like the same thing

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Except because I'm a nerd like Anderson Cooper

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Said guys I'm gay I've been like

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
My eyes glazed over

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Five sports jokes ago

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And it was really funny

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I did a great job retelling his joke

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh you're not gay so it's a little different effect

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
No it was such a strange thing that

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
They had a drone

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
On a leash

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
That was like hovering

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Trying to get away

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
And Wolf Blitzer was just kind of

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Staring at it like what's happening

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
And it was so odd and I was sitting

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
In the front row and I felt like this

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Weird prom queen to an event

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
I had no attachment to cause it's like

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
It's mainly for promoters right so like

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I mean not promoters advertisement

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
So it's like people from all over the country

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Selling stuff for these networks

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And they're like pushing

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Turner you know so they're like

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
We make you know 18 to 24

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
And like all these percentages

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
And these like weird power point presentations

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And fireworks

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I took a picture of one thing it was like

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Wolf Blitzer standing in front of a big screen

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
That said like your brand

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Plus

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Turner's Reach equals

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah it was like

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
It was like we're announcing the election

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Results now cause that was part of what they were selling

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
That was the creepy part

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Did you feel creeped out by the fact that

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
They kept insisting

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
That this election was going to be a squeaker

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
The same way the NFL would

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Assure you that this Super Bowl is going to be

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Is going to be packed

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
People are going to be glued to their sets

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And it's like ugh I'm so uncomfortable with that

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You're already state run

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Television like you're already just this

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
One tube that people get all their information through

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
It's the state of our country that we're talking about

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
It's like crazy obviously it's going to have

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Higher ratings but to be like

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
You better watch our country fall apart it's going to be crazy

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Like stay tuned

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
That way

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Because you guess who can

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
They can they can definitely put their

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Thumb on the scale especially

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
If like the whole point is for

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
No thumb to be on there like a thumb weighs a lot

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
In journalism

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Like Al Jazeera is probably like I don't know

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Just watch cause it's the world

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
You know what I mean like stay tuned cause that's what's happening

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
And they're like no we're going to make this fun

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah it's very

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Very disturbing

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
All the news organizations just keep boasting about

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Ratings during these debates

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
And things like that and it's just like

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
It really is depressing

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah they definitely didn't

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
There was some 9-11 footage

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Like cause it was like

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
We're always there CNN's always there

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
It was like friends

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
You know what I mean they're like remember friends huge hit

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
9-11 also a big hit

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Two big hits

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Well three

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Two and a half big hits

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I think one of those hits wasn't really a hit at all

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Oh are you one of those?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
You think the reptilians did it?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I think one of those hits was

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Planted detonators

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
On the eye beams of those

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
There's no black box found

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
What about

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Building 7? How come?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It was funny too that

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Sorry we can't move up but they said something about

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
They're doing another apprentice

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Season

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
And Donald Trump is producing it

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And I was like is this whole thing just to like

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Yes

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Just to get more people to watch the apprentice

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Of course it is

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
He's already won if he doesn't win the presidency

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
He's already won

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
He's the most famous person in the world right now

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
He might be the most famous person of all time

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Like you can't go anywhere in the world

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Where he's not a punchline or a setup or a thing

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I like to imagine it's like men in black

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Like underneath it

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
And there's this tiny little dying alien

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Who's actually running the body

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
That was the worst thing

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
We at Comic Con

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Are the co-creator of Rick and Morty

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Justin Roiland and his friends Alex Hirsch

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
And I can never remember the third guy's name

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Because I don't want to get it wrong

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Is this the guy you work with?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
No

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
They had a party on this yacht

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
And they just

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Why not invite everyone from Game of Thrones

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
And every fucker showed up

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Every single goddamn throne

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Ever in the game

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Like

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I didn't know that was going to happen

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
This party was on an old

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Like 1929 yacht

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Like a three deck old

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Like Rockefeller's yacht kind of looking thing

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
From the old days

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And our nerd comedy

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
And animator friends hanging out

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
And I'm around the bend and I see a guy

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
That I recognize and I go oh my god

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
And I just put my hand out and he goes hi

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
And it's Sam Well right

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
The chubby guy from Game of Thrones

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Books and protects the baby

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
And kills the white walker with the thing

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
And I go oh I don't know his name

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I'm like oh my god I love you on the show

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And he goes thank you that's really nice

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
And they turn the corner

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I go to the bar

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Ramsay Bolton

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
That was the most freaked out one

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Are you a Game of Thrones person?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
No I'm not

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
You're an incredible sport

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
That's pretty great

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Crazy

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I mean aren't there like 32 cast members

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
All that shit?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Yeah and on all their names

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Are like Yaman Yaman Yubin Yubin

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
You know they're not

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
No one's like Mike Steele Dick

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Like so that you can just remember

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
It's like Dinklage and that's it

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Like everybody else is like Yermin Sherman

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Germs

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Actually that would be easy to remember

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Yermin Sherman Germs

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
But I was gonna say the tough thing was

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Because you know they're fancy

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
They're an HBO show

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
They're from the most watched thing ever

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
They're like nerd royalty

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
And like it was just sad

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Cause all I wanted to ask was

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
What's it like to be so fucking

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Crazy famous right now

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Which is an answer they can either

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Their answer's gonna be the weirdest

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
The most distorted

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
And they're gonna be the most sick of answering that question

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
So it's like pointless to ask that

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
But it's really all I can think of to act

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I can't think of

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
It's fucking crazy

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
It's a mindblower

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
My life has changed forever

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Yeah and it's like what would that even mean

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah I'd go like okay I don't know why

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
So I don't know why I do that

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I think it's just good when I'm like really into

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Someone like I'm a fan of someone

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Instead of like trying to interact with them

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
So they actually know who I am

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I just like to like get stoned with them

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Or you know get like in an environment

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Where we get a little drunk or something

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Great good

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
But just to like kind of like

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Change reality where it's like

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Oh this person that I'm used to seeing talk

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I get to see in this like alternate

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Like I don't know that's the only best

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Take away I can get from it

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Because any time I try to like connect with someone I'm a fan of

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Never works

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Well there's all that pressure it's like

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Oh how can I fuck this up

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Which is something you should never be thinking

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
When you're talking to someone

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Because that's like that's something that

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Imagine you did that when you ordered coffee

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Did it wait today?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I just want to finish my one thought

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
So you don't think that I have to do these weird segues

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Because I would hate for you to think that

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
It's already happening

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
This thing runs like a swisk

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
That's why they call them Dan

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Stay on target Herman

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
But I just wanted to connect those dots

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
The bummer was that

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
In the midst of all of that

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Humility and fanboyishness

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
That I was feeling like

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
The other thing for them to talk about was

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Like so like Trump

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
You know and it's like I don't want

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I don't want Sir Davos

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Having to worry about that shit

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
But it is something for him to worry

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
About

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
He's got to worry about his fingers

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
He's got to worry about all sorts of things

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
He had ten fingers and he

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
In the show does he have like nine or something

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
The crazy thing was they just finished

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Shooting so they all have the same haircut

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Like they all

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
But they're wearing his J.Crew shirts

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
But it's like a little bit of

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Products you know

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Except for there's you probably

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
The show is ubiquitous enough that you

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Are you familiar with the image of

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Varis the bald eunuch

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Like he's kind of portly

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I feel like I am now

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Where he's like a big robe

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Maybe even in memes

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
You would have encountered this image

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Of this guy like he's the master

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Of gossip and

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Sabotage and subterfuge

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
And relies on apparently a network

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Of underage children to

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I don't know

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Wow this show goes deep

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
And he can teleport sometimes but

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
What

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah that dude goes

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I'll be right back and he's on

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
He's across the entire planet

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
But anyways he was

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Suffice it to say the guy is

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
He's like

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
He has three things about him

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
That make him recognizable

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
He was the one guy because he had

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
It was Tan Varis with like a full head

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Of hair so he wasn't getting

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Fucked with at all he didn't have to

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Answer any of my dumbass questions

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
He probably was sad about that

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
He's got it made man

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
That's what you want you want to play

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
A character that has an eye patch

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
So that you can detach yourself

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Totally

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
You were super young when you were

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Yeah I mean

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I was 14 and I did the pilot

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
What was your acting

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
14

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Hubba hubba

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
You grew up in Palm Springs

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I just researched

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Like so were you

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Not so many cheers for that huh

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Sherman's Deli

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Yeah that's all I have

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And your dad was an actor so

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
No so my grandfather was an actor

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Alright Wikipedia

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
It hasn't been updated

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
No my dad so my grandfather

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Was an actor and like

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Was born in New Orleans and like had a career

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
In Hollywood in like the 50's and 60's

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
He was in like Thomas Crown Affair

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
And Valley of the Dolls

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
And then he did a TV

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Show called Naked City

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
In 12 o'clock high

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And then he kind of got like blacklisted

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Because he like slept with a British model

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Whose husband was like a studio guy

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I don't know there's something that happened

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
You know towards the end but

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
My mom was like raised in Hollywood

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
And then my dad

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Is from Baghdad, Baghdad dad

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Baghdad dad

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
He had a whole bag of dads there

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
A whole bag of dads, I just picked one

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And so he

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Came over in the 70's

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Like $200 in his pocket

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
And his family

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Owns a lot of the big strip clubs

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
In Hollywood like Seventh Veil

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
The Body Shop girls girls girls

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah so

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
He was a bar back

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Seventh Veil was the first one

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Because he was trying to still convince himself

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
He was like it's not at all

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
It's classy and it's cultural

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I don't think they're worried about that

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
But my mom

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Was like a law school dropout

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
And so she got a job as a waitress

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
At the Body Shop

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
And they met and

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Fell in love

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
And then decided to open up their own business

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
In Palm Springs because my grandfather

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Had a weekend home in Palm Springs

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
He retired because all the actors in the 60's did

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
And so then they moved there

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
And opened up their own strip club

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
And uh

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
This is so romantic as long as they're still together

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
They are still together and the strip club is still going

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And uh

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
That's called show girls

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
It's a cathedral city

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I have to imagine there was some sort of mafia connection

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Not your family but if you're going to open up

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
A strip club in Palm Springs

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
The mob is involved right

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
You know what I mean

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
There was just like a lot of them

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Uh

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
They're Arabic

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
They have gold chains

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
They're gamblers

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
We went to Vegas every weekend

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
A lot of my childhood

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
So it was very like anything you need

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
It had the same persona

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
But I don't think they were like

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Killing people

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Sometimes one of the clubs would burn down

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
That kind of thing

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
That's what I'm talking about

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
But my dad is very like

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
The straightest arrow of the bunch

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Like he's very conservative

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
So in Palm Springs

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
This one would be run like a tight ship

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
No more burning

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
No more burning

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
He's a very honest business man

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Yeah

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
We have a friend Chris Romano

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
This is all public record

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
He said it on TV

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
He's told the story on the podcast

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
His name is Chris Romano

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
He couldn't be more Italian

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
A little

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Sounds like a horrible debate

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
He's short

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
But he's so Italian

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
And so charming

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
And he was always

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
His partner Eric Faulkner from Boston

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
So he's got this Boston accent

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
And he's just like, uh, Chris Romano

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Ladies can't resist me

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Also, to know him for 15 minutes

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
You've seen his dick twice

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
That guy's dick is out

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
He's very open

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
He lowers the bar of

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Go to channel101.com and watch Shit Buster

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
You'll know everything you need to know

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
So he finds out

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
In his adulthood

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Like way into being a whole human being

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
He finds out that

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Romano was this

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Like, you know, who

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Quickly chosen

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Witness protection program name

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
That I think his dad picked

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
And he was a Lebanese arsonist

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Oh my god

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
So this quintessential Boston

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Italian kid

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
All of a sudden you're like

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Oh, you're Lebanese

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
He was doing a drunk history

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
And he was going to talk about

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
The Red Sox winning the World Series

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
And he got so drunk

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Derek Waters kept getting him drunker

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
And drunker, and drunker

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And finally he couldn't get past Game 1

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
He couldn't get to Game 2

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
He lost all train of thought

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
And he goes, I'm so sorry

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
You know my dad was the most famous arsonist

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
In Massachusetts

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
And he's in the

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Witness, they were in the Witness

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Location program

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
And I run into

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Chris Romano in the baby

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Toy section at a Toys R Us

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Don't ask why I was there

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
He has a baby, I was just there being

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
A competitor

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
But he told this thing, I got so drunk

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I told the story, he was like

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
A lot of the people I talk about are still alive

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
They're in jail

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Because his dad would

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Those are the dots I was connecting

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Mob, Middle Eastern

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
And

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
The arson business

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
My dad will be so happy

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Because I guess he was just a guy

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
You hired, he was like a fire bug

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
You know, you just like, for insurance

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
There's a guy that you actually get

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
That specializes in setting the fires

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Like an air braleota

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
It was a movie, guys

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
It was in a burning building

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
The reason we ran into each other

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
At that weird up front was

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Because you were in something

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
That's rolling out, are you only acting in that?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I'm producing it too

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
And it's

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
What's it called?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
A search party

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Is it airing yet?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
No, it comes out in November

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
On TBS

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
But they dropped the very funny, so it's just TBS

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
When I first found out I was like

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
TBS, very funny

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
We're not doing that anymore

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
The only bad thing about the history channel

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Was that right before I started doing a show on it

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
They had decided

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
That they were rebranding

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Just the word history

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Interesting

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
You have to catch yourself

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I'm on the history

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Ask any of these guys

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
I made it through the transgender revolution

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Without a hitch

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
I wove through those cones

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Like a fucking

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Greased shark

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Like a greased shark

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Going through cones

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
But

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
That doesn't conjure up alacrity

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
They weren't attached to the seaport

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
They weren't floating

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
The history thing really

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Through me

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
It's the history channel

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Every time you want to make a joke

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Within the show

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
The history channel people are here

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
They correct you

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
They're the most

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Lacy fair, like chilled

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Non-channel

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
In the world

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
In history

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
But

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
It would just come through

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
It was an edict that trickled down to

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
My set

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
It was usually levy

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
You gotta say history instead of history channel

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Fucking dick

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
He's crying

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
He's laughing

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
But

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
I could

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Whatever

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
It's a show

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
The show is

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
It's a group of friends

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Who are kind of reuniting

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
In the wake of one of their friends'

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Disappearances, right?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Yeah, they're like friends

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
They're kind of like not the best people

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
My character's kind of a wallflower

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
She doesn't know what she wants

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Millennial sort

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
And then a girl from college

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
She went to school with it

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
She didn't know well at all

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
In front of Finder

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
She's not the right person for the job

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
But she becomes obsessed with it

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
I describe it as a hipster Colombo

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Yeah

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
That's got my number

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
John Early's in it

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
It's just based on anything in reality?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
No, the creators of the show

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Sarah Violet-Bliss

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
And Charles Rogers

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Have weird mysteries in their family

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
But

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
That's all I'll tell you

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
So they kind of were inspired by that

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Like having a mystery

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
And if something happened

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Like someone went missing in our lives right now

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Like what would we do?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
What are the tools we actually have to find somebody?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
But it's not really based on anything

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
But now, whether it's because I did the show or not

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I noticed so many missing

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Poster things

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Before the show, I was like, people don't go missing anymore

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I mean, they do, I guess, but I just wasn't aware of it

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
But now there's so many posters

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Where people are like, college

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I've been kind of collecting them in a weird way

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
To validate my career, I think

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
You just never saw it

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
You're now seeing them

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Yeah, I'm just noticing them everywhere

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
And that's like when the pilot starts

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
It's a lot of me doing this

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Just like staring off

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Into the distance, like looking confused

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
That's like 90% of the show

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
So this is a pilot you shot

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Or it's been picked up for series?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
We shot a whole first season

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Congratulations

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
We assume if it's a

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
If it's a ratings bonanza

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Then at the end of it, you'll have the extra scene

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
That you shot where she goes

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Like, you know what, I love solving mysteries

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Yeah, exactly

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
And then I'm like, if you love solving them too

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Press A

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
And then it's an interactive show

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Is it something you do, continue to do?

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Yeah, I mean, I always have

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Like a little, not to be like, oh, I'm scared of TV

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
But TV shows go on for like

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
So fucking long, it's kind of insane

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
So like, I'm not going to be like

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I'd love to do it for the next decade of my life

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
But I definitely like to do like

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah, three seasons, I don't know

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Yeah, you'll, you'll

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
I want to do it again

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
I mean, this is just the old curmudgeon in me

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I'm just like shaking my cane at you and going like

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Oh, you'll get a taste of ones that don't last very long

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Yes

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
But the production was like, I canceled

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
I've done like two shows that were great

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
But they've only gone for two or three seasons

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
So like, it's nice when they're kind of in that thing

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
But I don't know what tomorrow is, so I'm okay

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
I mean, everything I work on fucking lasts forever, too

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
Cause my fucking shit, gold

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
It's gold

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
I love the new season of acceptable TV, by the way

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
I've never failed in anything

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
God damn it, fuck you

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Not you

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
No, it says fuck you on your phone

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Yeah, yeah, so I'm telling you to go fuck yourself

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Oh, you just, you did animals

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
What did you do, first season or second season?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Oh, I did the first season

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
I was a rat

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Yeah, I think, I think I may have

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Did they show that one at Starburn's

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
My animation studio?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I saw it

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Is that yours?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I saw it at like a

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
The rap party

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Yeah

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
At the bar, were you invited to that?

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I, you know, it's like

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
It's really touch and go with these guys

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Phil and Mike, cause I can't

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I can't, I just

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I just

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I just go random now

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I just say

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Hey Phil, hey Mike, and like half the time I

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
I nail it

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Oh, right, like you don't know which one's which

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Did they look alike, right?

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I mean, they're Jewish, is that?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
I thought it was

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Can we have one show where this

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Conversation doesn't happen

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I know the difference, but I was like

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
In a room with them, you know what I mean

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I know I've been there

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
I have an office in the same building as them

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I can go like inspect their faces

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
It's about how much you want to know

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
I've watched YouTube videos

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
And I've frozen the frame

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
And I'm like, like someone have a different ear lobe

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Someone do something

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
I think they dress differently

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
That's what I noticed

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Maybe you have racial recognition

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
I have, I'm pretty, you know

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
I like to fall back on the face-blind

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Phrase, but a lot of people say

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I'm just a prick

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
But, but, but

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I think what it is is that your

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Your brain is battling for glucose

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
The different, the different sections

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Of it when you're developing

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
So if catching a frisbee

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Like, like makes

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Like your brain think

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
This guy's jam is frisbee

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
That's going to lead to more of him

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
In the DNA strain

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
So you need to play frisbee with everybody, you know

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
So we need to send more resources

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
To the part of your brain that catches and throws frisbees

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Like, but you need those early successes

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
To trigger those board meetings, you know

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And I think like recognizing

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Telling the difference between two people

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Who are mocking you

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
It only makes it worse

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
To humanize them, you know

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
I just, I just, I just

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
I just consider it obviously to like remember people

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
But at the same time I'm like

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Who gives a shit? There's so many people

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
At least I don't know who you are

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Yeah, exactly

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I think it's fun

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I remember I met Ryan Gosling once

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Ryan, you're here

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
But, I met him very briefly

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
But when I met him

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I was like, hi, I'm Alia

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
And he was like, Alia, so nice to meet you

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Alia, and I was like

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
He's either a Scientologist or just like

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Works really hard at remembering people's names

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
And then I ran into him another time

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
And I was like, there's no fucking way

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Ryan Gosling can remember who I am

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
And he was like, Alia, right?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
And I was just like, this is why you're a movie star

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Everybody, he's working so hard

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
He's also a crime fighter

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
We've learned on this show

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
One of our very good friends

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Daniel Gillies has this story

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
We have to drag it out of him because he's one of these

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
High roady, fancy pants

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
He's a real life hero

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Ryan's just a friend

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
He's a wonderful person

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
He's a New Zealand actor who

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Saw news of Katrina happening

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
And just went, I gotta go down there

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
And help, like without

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
No designs on anybody knowing about it

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
And then in the story

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
You have to drag it out of him

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Because he knows how it sounds for it

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
But the story is that

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
So he called Ryan Gosling his good friend

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
And Ryan was like, I'm already

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
On my way

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Ryan's like getting out of bed

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
He's like, I'm already on my way

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
The thing is, hook me a flight

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
The part of the story that he leaves out is that

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Ryan was already in New Orleans because he was there

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Like shooting?

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Destroying the levee

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
So he's the first one on the scene

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Right?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I mean

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I mean, it's clever

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
But

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Just focus

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Just act well

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Just be a good movie star too

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
You have to rig the game like this

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I'm sure you're a wonderful performer

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Our expectations aren't that high of him

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Alright, well speaking of celebrities

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
And the culture of them

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I think it's time to bring out

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Our San Diego Comic Con correspondent

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Ryan Ridley

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Hello

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Have we spoken to Spencer at all yet?

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Have we even said hi to Spencer?

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Oh, hi Spencer

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Hey Spencer

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I say hi to Spencer three times a day

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Spencer's mic doesn't seem to be on

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Spencer's doing a bit

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
This is called mute protest

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Spencer, before we get to Ryan Ridley

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Did you enjoy your Comic Con experience?

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Oh, it was great

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Every year it's great

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
I walked 16 miles on Saturday

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Friday

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Saturday

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
16 miles

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Finally, take it up with the health app

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
That's what it told me

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
That's good, that's a lot

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
No, it's bad, it's terrible

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
My feet are like irons that are hot

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Hot iron

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Are you getting blisters?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Oh, I get blisters, I have something

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I don't know if they're corns or bunions

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Or who knows what, but they

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Manifest at Comic Con

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Boy, I tell you what

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I wonder if it's any different

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
In either direction because of your

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Somewhat famous

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Webbed feet

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Oh, it's exactly because of my

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Somewhat famous webbed feet

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
No, I have skin

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
It does weird stuff sometimes

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
That's probably why my feet are

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Webbed, it's all connected

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Only two toes of my feet are webbed

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Yeah, but it would

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
I'm not like a fish man

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Fish don't have

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Facial hair

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Catfish kind of do

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Oh, yeah

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
That they do

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I feel like an idiot now

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Also, there's the bearded clam

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I like how you settled back into

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Your scene, you're like, bearded clam

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I'm just saying some fish

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Have facial hair

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Um, well

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Ridley, did you

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Were you in San Diego, Alia?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
No, I wasn't this year

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
A film I did called The Final Girls

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Which, thanks, yeah

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
It's a really fun movie that nobody

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Saw because they didn't know how to

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Provote it

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
He is, I know that guy

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
He's a great guy

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
So him and Todd

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Oh, look at you

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
He's doing a dance

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
He takes a lot of pride in that

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
But they were doing some kind of

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
He's been doing this strange promotion

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
For the film, like doing midnight screens

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
And stuff, and he did something

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
At Comic Con this year where he had an ice cream truck

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Called Ice Cream for Ice Cream

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Something like that

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Where they were trying to promote it

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Still, and Thomas was there

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
And Angela Trimber, it was something

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Obviously, it wasn't enough to get me to go

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
What's the conceit

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
The conceit

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
And then I want you to perform

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
The key scene

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I wanted to know what the movie's about

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
But I wanted you to think I went to Harvard

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Yeah, I did it

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
It's about

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
These kids who go see

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
A movie that the main girl's mom

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Was in, it's like an 80's horror movie

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
And then they get sucked into the movie

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
And they have to escape

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Last action hero with the horror genre

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Totally, it's a really fun romp

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Nice Ridley

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Thank you Spencer

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
This is why he's the subcomptroller

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Did you also go to Harvard?

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
subcomptroller?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Jeff is the controller

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
And I've sub-perimacationally

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
You see, it's helpful

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
There's a whole dynamic, I don't know

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Plan B

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Alright, well we were at Comic Con

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
I've been before, it is super, super fun

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Alia, is that right?

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Yeah, I mean in my head

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Earlier, guess who else I know

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Who?

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Brad Copeland and John Levenstein

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Who are those people?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
The writers, sorry

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Sorry, they're only writers

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I've never met

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
The great writers

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
I've never met, what's the will in the show?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Hunting?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
No, the one in the show

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I've never met any of the actors, but I know the writers

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Who's the will in the show?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
I wanted to say Forte

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Who's the will, sir?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
You're twined, comedically

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Listen, man, I'm freaking out

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
You're doing great, we know people in common

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
You're safe with me

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
I always get Will Forte mixed up with Will Sasso

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
And it's really weird

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
That's crazy

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
You were talking about Will Forte at a party

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
And I was imagining Will Sasso

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
And it was hilarious

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
What party was that, Spencer?

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
That party that there was hot dogs

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
On a plate or some shit

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
And people were yelling at people

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Trying to tee up, Dan, for the next segment

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Tell us about your party experience, Ryan Ridley

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
So every year, Ali, entertainment weekly

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Or don't

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Entertainment weekly has a party

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
At Comic-Con

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I think it's the fanciest of the parties

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
In terms of like

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
It starts at nine

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
And then by ten, it's filled to fire code

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
And then you can't get in

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Right

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
That was me just kind of teeing

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
That was my crawl

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
So you weren't left out of this

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
So you guys went to this amazing party?

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Let me give you some backstory

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I'm in my head a lot

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
This Comic-Con is weird

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I don't know if I should feel more shame

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Less shame, more insecure

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Less insecure

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
I don't know which way the compass should spin

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
The what should spin?

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
The compass, for my psychological state of mind

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
But I'll have you know

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
The hottest party at Comic-Con

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
The entertainment weekly party

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
And I'll have you know

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
That it was all I was talking about at work

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
For the entire week

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Lording it over everyone's heads

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
On top of the fact

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
That I found out that Dan and Justin

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Were not invited

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I'm a writer in Rick and Morty

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I should clarify that

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
You understand the relationship

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
This hierarchy

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
How did you score this coveted invitation?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Jeff?

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Because neither did I know about it

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Nor was I invited

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
I was told by haters

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
That it was my

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Agencies

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Behind the scenes manipulations

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Apparently that's not true

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
The answer I got was

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
It's because I'm cool

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Who told you that?

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Yeah, did you tell yourself?

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
His agent told me that

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Wait

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
What's the difference though

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
If you're going down the road

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Of it's cool to be invited

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
To a Hollywood party

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
You're already in trouble

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
I'm happy to go down that road

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
You're right, objectively you're already in trouble

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
But you're in trouble when you wake up

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
It's a material universe

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Until we return

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
To the beams of light that we were

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Originally before the Big Bang

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Which happens

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
So that light could bounce off

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Stay on target

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Stay on target

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Comic-Con 2016

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
I want to know what happened at the party

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Why is it cool

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
What is the difference

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
If your agency making manipulations

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Why does that make you less cool

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
In terms of a Hollywood party

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Because they're haters

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
They're trying to detract from his achievements

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
But why would that detract from it

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Like usual, you get me

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Yeah man

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
You're like George Costanza

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I just realized that

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Can I explain something

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Exactly

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Exactly

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
This is what he doesn't get

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I'm running all of this

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
This experience we're about to talk to

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
It's all through a filter

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
I don't belong, I shouldn't be here

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I hate myself

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Give me an example of a hater

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
And what a hater said to you about this

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Who is Hayton

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
That's probably one of them

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Here she is

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Other writers and the staff of Rick and Morty

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Were they trying

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Were they trying to diminish

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Your potential joy in this party

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
No Jeff, they were trying to

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Of course

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
That's what they're always trying to do

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
What happened at the party

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
How can you say your name

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
You're on the list

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
But you said you were lording it

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Over everybody, so of course

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
You created your own haters

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
He did do that

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
You're a hater

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Party

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Of course you're going to take a shot at that

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I didn't even

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Stoop to take the bait

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I just called my agent and said

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Why am I not on the EW list

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I just found out Ryan fucking Ridley is

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Exactly

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Haters

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
So the first person

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
We saw when he walked in

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Was Will Forte

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Dammit Spencer

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Picture Will Sasso for this story

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Continue

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
And all of a sudden we see

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Is this even acceptable to talk about these people

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
And what they're doing behind the scenes of things

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
That's the EW party, right

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Maybe I'm going to make Will Forte

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Look bad, actually no, he was a hero

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
He was your own judgment

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
And he couldn't get in

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Or he clearly came and changed his mind

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
At some point, I don't know what happened

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
But he was like I'm out of here, going on their bar

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
And I'm looking at that and going

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
What the fuck hope do I have

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I don't understand how this party works

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
They're not letting Will Forte in

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I'm sitting here thinking I'm on the list

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Finally I'm on the list

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
The list means nothing

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
What time are you getting there?

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
30, party starts at 9, cool time

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Word of God, it's packed

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
I asked multiple friends to see if

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
My friend could get in and they're like

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
It's already at capacity, it seems like

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
It's going to be rough to get you A

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
On the list and then B in

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
The only thing that haunts me about that

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Is that we did, the entire time we were standing

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Outside waiting to be let in

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
There was one exception to that rule

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
There seemed to be abiding by strict

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Fire code in letting people in

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Except the fucking workaholics guys

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Right past us

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
I don't know what they named

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
On Comic Con those dudes it feels like

44:45.000 --> 44:51.000
Our glib enmity is becoming real now

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
I'm so jealous of them

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
There were professional football players

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Who I was told were professional football players

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Standing there, I didn't recognize them

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Certainly, but there are people

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Will Forte's getting turned away

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
We're sitting here, Dan Harmon

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
I guess he's a big deal, they're not letting

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Us in and all of a sudden the fucking workaholics

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Two thirds of them by the way

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Which one was missing?

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
I don't know, the one in the Pitch Perfect movies

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Well obviously ironically the actual workaholic

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
From their troupe, you know

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
The guy who's back in LA making phone calls

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
He's working, yeah

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
And they get the whistle on the wave

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
And they just stroll right past us

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Last Comic Con I was hanging out with them

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
And Tom Green rolled up and was like

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
You guys want to smoke some weed?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
We were like, alright

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Smoking at a hotel lobby with Tom Green

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
And the workaholics did

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Those guys

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
The first time I ran into them at Comic Con

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
It was, I had to

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Find out retroactively after a guy talked to me

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
For a half hour asking a bunch of weird questions

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
About New Zealand

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
That they had convinced that guy that I was Peter Jackson

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Oh that's a great joke

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
It was really funny

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
That is so good

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
The only guy who arguably

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Was hurt by it

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Was a guy who kind of

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
In practical joke karma

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
If he's such a

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Fan of Peter fucking Jackson

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
He should know I'm not Peter Jackson

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Like I don't have an accent

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
But he was definitely

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
He was a little traumatized

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Because the punchline of the story

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Is the guy after his third

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
I've never been to New Zealand

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
And the guy's like

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Okay, very funny

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
When you're shooting there

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
When I was shooting there

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
I'm a writer

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
And the guy went

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Fucking guys told me you were Peter Jackson

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Like he was so

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
He looked over at that

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
They couldn't have written it better

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
And I was like you assholes

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
And they were like

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
I wouldn't even say they were cracking up

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Because they probably do that every five minutes

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
They're almost bored by their own sensibilities

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
They're like we know it's funny

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
No, I like those guys

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
So you guys got into the party eventually?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Yeah, what happened in the party man?

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Dan, you were saying earlier

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
That there was a control

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Bouncer guy that was going a little over the edge

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
No human being

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Should be given that much power

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Like there's always checks and balances

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
There was a 25 year old kid

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Who for the first time in his life

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Was like telling people

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
He might recognize from movies and stuff

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
They can't come in, he was like told to hold the line

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
And he fucking snapped

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
He was inconsolably

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
He had lost his mind

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
He was like

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
The guy that Tom Cruise has to kill

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
In the basement in one of the worlds

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Oh god

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Like he had just become more

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Strategy than man

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
To the point where he was like

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
His own mother was like what he had doing

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Because we got

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
This happened twice

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Like we got

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Waved by my friend

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Dan Snirson

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Do I know a guy from Entertainment Weekly

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Dan Snirson

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Comes out

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Because he's

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Anticipating that it should be pretty easy

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
To get somebody in

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
And he works there

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
So he waves me forward so we have to walk

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Past all the people that can't get in

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
And we stand there

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Like man

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
His head was just wagging

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
All the time

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Everything that was being said

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
To him was

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Go fuck yourself and your whole family

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
And then whatever you were actually saying

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
He was just adding this

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
And I said

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I got a little smile out of him

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
I think I diffused him just a hair

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Because he's kept doing that

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And I said

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
You're gonna be fine

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Is gonna get in there

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
And I would not have come up here

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
I had been led to believe

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
That you're doing fine

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
But I think that just hit him

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Like a drop of carbohydrates

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Maybe he was just like showing teeth

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Maybe I misinterpreted as a smile

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Anyways hard to get into the party

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
But you're welcome

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Because eventually

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Dan Snirson who is the

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Mench of the millennia

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
This guy could have just blown me off

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
It's a terrible dynamic too

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
And you're like I don't even want to go to the stupid party

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
That they won't let me in

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I have to get into the story

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Wait Dan are you saying that

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Without you

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Dan Harmon and Dan Snirson

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
The improbably named

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Dan Snirson

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
That Ryan fucking Ridley

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Wouldn't have gotten into that party

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
We were all on the list

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
This was about fire code

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
This is about games is what it was

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
White people will party

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Say RSVP with a plus one

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
And then you'll be able to get into the party

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
And suddenly now you can't get to this level

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Oh now you can get to this level but there's nine more levels after that

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
What the fuck kind of game are they playing

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Why are they doing this to me

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I'm the hero of the story

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
I don't know if the audience I feel like

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Is the fucking villain in the story

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I'm the hero of the story

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
I'm the hero this isn't my world

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
I don't get invited to these parties

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
And I'm like oh I'm getting invited to this party

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
From childhood

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
We've known since we were eight years old

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
He's never even met a celebrity

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
He's never even been in California

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I'm giving him the time of his life

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
He's getting high with the wave on the yacht

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
He's with the Dr. Drew and EZ

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Giving him noogies and stuff

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
At this party

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Dr. Drew and EZ

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Or Dr. Dre and EZ

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Which is the one that gives advice

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
On TV shows

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Those two were together

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Because EZ

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
EZ's dead

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
EZ's dead

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
The young actor who played EZ

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
I'm not an idiot

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
He was the one that was with Dr. Drew

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
The psychologist

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Do you think they thought it was funny

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
That he was hanging that with Dr. Drew

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Kind of like Dr. Dre

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
What kind of strange pairings at this party

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
You wouldn't believe it such as

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Such as

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Well I really

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Just want to brag this isn't funny at all

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
You're going to take us

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Across the threshold of the party right

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Hopefully

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Danny McBride came

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Up to me

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
He's a fan

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I don't know if he's a fan of the podcaster

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
If he's just Rick and Morty

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Something tells me it's Rick and Morty

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Something tells me it's Rick and Morty

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
He wanted to meet me

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
The podcast

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Who's like somebody

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
In the new trailer for Justice League

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Anybody know about that little

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Diddy

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Thank you

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
He's an

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Unequirable taste

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
It's like George

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I wish I was at the party with you

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
To see it through your eyes

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Remember my hijinks

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
I was yelling at people

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
It's great to have hijinks

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
I always do pranks at big parties

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
You're serious at this party

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
He just stood up everybody

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Jesus Christ

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
He dropped that microphone on accident

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
And then did what a cat would do

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Which is just he turned it into

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Grooming himself

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
It was so clearly an accident

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
So Ryan

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
You are the self-proclaimed hero of the story

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
You just walked us across the first

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Threshold I believe right

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
When you become active

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
What happens?

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Well

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Give us the key scene

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
We find out that Dan Schneersen

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Can get us into

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
The next area

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Which is just another place to wait

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
To get into the party

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
But a little bit nicer

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Well I will say a lot nicer

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
He kept bringing us hot dogs and drinks

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
This guy who works

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
At Entertainment Weekly

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Who interviewed me about Heat Vision

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Like

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
He's done

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I would say

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Because of that

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
We have this bond

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
He's done interviews with me since then

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
We were kind of like kids

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
In the industry together

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Like there was a fraternal bond

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
There maybe

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
And he respects you

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
I'm sorry this is so fucked up

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
His party ends and he was missing it

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
And he brought us hot dogs

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Taking drink orders

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
And the party was so crowded

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
And then this waiting area

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Is this like in a hotel?

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
The Hard Rock Cafe

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Oh my god

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I just blew my mind

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I was at my happiest there

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Because there were hot dogs

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
And I kept thinking

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
If you just flipped it

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Easily that crowded hot area

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
If Johnny Depp was over here

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
And you were told

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
That this was like the platinum

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Because it's like a place where you can go like this

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
And like

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
You go to the Viper Room

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
It's weird that culture of

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
This little tiny booth

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Having a table is a VIP thing

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
At the Viper Room

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
But if you put that table anywhere else

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
You'd be like

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I'm doing you a favor by sitting here

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
The game they played is we got into the

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Party, the waiting area

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
And it was open

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
There were six of us that were together

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
And by the way immediately open bar

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Spread out great

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Magical amazing wonderful fresh air

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
And they're bringing us churros

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
And hot dogs

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
And we're laughing and we're vaping

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
And we're having a good time

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
But I'm still thinking

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
But I want to get in fucking there

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Which looks miserable

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Why did they do this to us?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
It's about the search

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
It became a game

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
It was tolerated if it wasn't

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
The

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
The Snirson Factor turned it into a role playing game

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Because it was like

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
There was a thing that needed to be unlocked

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Like Minecraft or something

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Like you needed to make something to make something to make something

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
And I did get

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
That's the longest I've ever waited for anything

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
And I was like I was kind of held together

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
With this sort of quest aspect of it

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Because they kept saying five more minutes

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
And then we'll go and then you know what I mean

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
And then you go like well maybe five more minutes after that too

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Because you don't want to

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
It's like gambling

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Ryan you talked so much shit to your coworkers

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
For the past seven days

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
That you now have to get into this party

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
You can't go back home with your tail between your legs

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
And say that you didn't get in

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
And that was fueling every fiber of my being

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
That night

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
So here's the weird thing about the party

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
You finally get past the threshold

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
And the party, it's around a pool

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Can I tell you one little detail

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
That's going to come back later in the story

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
So while we were out there

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
I was trying to you know play the game of

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Like alright let's have a little

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Fun with the situation

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I knew we were the losers technically

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
And they're the winners and they're on the other side

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
And they bring us hot dogs so there's a room

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
That had like a patio

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
That went out to kind of our area

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
But it was also on the other side of it

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Was the real party and there was a private room

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
And these people were in it, I didn't see who was in it

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
I grabbed the hot dog and I went up to that

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
And I leaned over and I go yeah you guys might be in that party

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
There's no hot dogs

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
And they're kind of like not looking at me

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Basically acting like you guys are acting now

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
They can hear you though, there's no like wall between you two

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
No there's no wall, no

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
It was like a plexiglass like Pope Mobile wall

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
It was like bulletproof plastic

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
This is going to pay off later

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Whoever was in there definitely heard me screaming

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
This is going to pay off later

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
So you're just yelling at strangers now

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
You mean Taylor Swift because that's who you were yelling at

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Did you not notice that?

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I was yelling at the Hollywood elite Jeff

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
So far you are

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Definitely the hero of the story

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Thank you

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
There's no dispute there

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
So remember that detail so then we get

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Finally let in to the grand

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Event

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Okay

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
So it's in the courtyard of a hotel

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
And there's a pool

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
And so you're partying around the pool

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
And but in the pool

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Because

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
What are you going to put in the pool?

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Awards

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
There's water in it

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
But what do you do?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Do you put copies of your magazine?

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
They'll get wet

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
You put a grease

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Shark in a bunch of cones

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
So in the pool

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Is a bunch of

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
What do you call them?

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Lifesavers

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Is that what you call them?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Intertubes

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
They're like little smaller intertubes

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
And

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
But also a bunch of

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Young people

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
That were hired

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Models

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
They were just like treading water

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
And hanging out on the floaties

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
And everyone was just

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Staring at them

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
We were all

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
No matter how famous you were

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
If you were out of the pool

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Because they were in the pool

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
You were better than them

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
They were reduced to

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
The white-haired guy that shows up at the party

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
And boogie nights that end up having to have the Coke girl

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Like that guy

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
With the gray hair that just looks

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
At Walberg's dick and then it's like

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
It's pretty nice

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
It's nice to meet you

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Kind of like weird Jackie Gleason

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Jeff the killer

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
And they're all pruney

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
And forced to say

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I'm so thirsty

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Because we're like

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
So everyone's just

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Staring at these people in the pool

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
And I'll tell you

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Somebody came up to me and said

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Can we ask you some questions

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Like what do you think about this pool thing

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
You ask the people in the pool this question

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
No, they ask me what I thought of the people

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
In the pool

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I just can't get over the fact

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
The crazy thing is that right now

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
If I got into the pool

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
That would be the weird thing

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Right

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I was just freaking out

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
I'm standing in a hotel

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
And I'm in the courtyard of a hotel

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
And there are humans

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Being used as art

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
I hope they do

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
I could ruin everything

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
By using the pool right

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Like Dan Harbour got in the pool

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Or just anybody though

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
A family from Iowa got in the pool

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Everyone would be like Jesus Christ do something

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
There was a lot of talk about me going in the pool

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
In my own head

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
And I was like trying to weigh

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Like

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
This could be the coolest move ever

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
I'd be the guy who fucking would

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Fuck the facade

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Of the veneer of we're all too cool to go in the pool

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
In this fucking party I'm gonna go in

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
And everybody will talk about me and know my name

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
I hate the Hollywood elites

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I hate them

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Did the pool people count towards the capacity

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Of the fire crew

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Because that's stupid as fuck

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I think they were technically their fire proof

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Because they were way

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
They are in water

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
They're there to watch everybody burn

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
They're the only people that could

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
They could live through a fire for like 36 hours

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Until all the water evaporated and they'd be like

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
It's getting hot in this pool

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
But they've got all of that time

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Like we're still on the clock man

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Now what were these

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
How many of these model swimmers were there

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
They were like I'm gonna say

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I think they were like shifting

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
There was a little bit of a rotation there

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
It looked like there were seven or eight

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
The thing that really threw me

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Because I was just like watching

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I was super high

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And so the whole thing had this weird

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
That's weird

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
But I kind of appreciate that stuff

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Because then you get the luxury of feeling

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Like Hunter S. Thompson

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Like that's a favor they're doing you

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Like it's like oh this party is crazy

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I kind of feel like if it wasn't

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
We'd be disappointed

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
If there wasn't some weird fucking thing

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Out of those parties is like

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
How odd they are that they're like humans

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Are treated differently

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
You're more important for this like

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Cast system yeah and you're like

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Okay I guess like a shit on your face

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And they're like it would be kind of okay

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
David Cross has that

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Extended pit about like when

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Desserts have like gold leaf on them

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
And it's just like fuck you

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I can't even digest this

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I'm just gonna shit it

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Out of my asshole

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
After you serve it to me

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It's gold

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It is like

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
We use interchangeably words like

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
You know like red carpet stuff

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Like luxury, pizzazz, glamour

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
The La La Land and all that stuff

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
But it's like all it is it's just like

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It's just this fantasy of like holy shit

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Like we're in the running man

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And like you're running and I'm not

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Like

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
That's why I thought anyways

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
If you called something

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
A VIP something I'm in like I'd pay

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
$50 for the letters VIP to be

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Added to an otherwise identical ticket

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
That I had into an empty

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Warehouse where nothing happened

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Except farts

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
But if I'm going then I want

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
The VIP ticket to the fart house

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
But

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
So the weird thing for me

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
The deal breaker was I wasn't like offended

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
By any of it I wasn't like I was just like

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
High and like kind of going this is funny

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Like it's like I always

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
This is a good chance for me to pretend

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I'm in the first scene of someone's

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Biopic you know like cause it's like

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
The camera's gotta be coming down on this

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Like cause it could cost money to produce

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
This set so like

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
And there's like a bunch of people here so there's must be

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Maybe Frank Oz is meeting someone

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
In the corner or like

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Like Dan Harmon was there

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Yeah I'm part of the panning thing

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And I'm going like the thing about community

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Like what would I have to say to be

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
To be recognizable in this like panning

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Shot

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
So but the thing that really threw me

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
About the pool thing was this

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
There was this one kid this dude

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
He kept there was music playing

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
And he was like he kept like rapping

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
He was like if it was

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Hip hop he was like he was like

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Wrapping along with the music

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And I was like it was really

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
The guy who was hired to just swim in the pool

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Cause he was like sending this

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Direct visual and audio signal

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
It's like no I'm here in the

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
At the same party

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
This is all happening to all of us at the same time

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
And it was like stop it

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Like you're supposed to

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Be like you're supposed to

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Like yeah like you're supposed to be

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Detached like

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
It would be like if a burger grew legs

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Like on your bun

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And tried to like it was like

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
You'd be like this is bad

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And the chef would be like no I think that's great

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
You like beef don't you

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And you'd be like no I like

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Discs of meat

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Where the other people in the pool being like

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Henry what are you doing man

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I think they would maybe float away from him

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
A little bit cause they're like I'm not going

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Hitching my inner tube to that star

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
There's one pool person that was

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Showboat and you're saying is that what the justice was

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
He was just having a good time

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I'm saying

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
That's the reason why he was doing the thing that threw me

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
It's not his good time that threw me

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
What threw me was the actual audio

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Visual stimulus of

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Him

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Instead of just floating aimlessly

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
In the pool which I thought was like oh it's like

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Future art it's like handsome people in the pool

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Like yeah you're sexy

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Like be our pool

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Like it's a cauldron

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Where witches were like boiling you

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
And your essence is like

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And then one of them is like do what dude

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
You're like no no no stop

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Yeah you take like a canoe

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Or kind of stir them a little bit

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Just like

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
There's one guy at every

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
W party that's like

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
A Herman Kent

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
He's always got a man in the pool

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Always keeps flipping the actors

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
In the pool

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
What do you think the explanation was

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Do you think that it was they all lined up

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Before they got in the pool and their boss said

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Alright listen here are the rules

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
This, that and the other thing that breaks are every 15 minutes

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
So no don't just

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Zone out and stare dead eye and kind of

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Float around, don't talk

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Just have fun with it, just be yourself

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And then he was the one who broke the rule

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Or he followed it

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Or it was the opposite and they were like you guys

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Have fun, rap, riff with the

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Yell up at the celebrities and do bits with them

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
And have fun making a show and they're all like

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
These idiots are not doing anything and he's like

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I'm fucking doing it

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Yeah it could easily be that the rest of them are like

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Fuck this I'm going dead inside

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Or we don't know

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
That list leaked to Kanye

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
People were like oh Kanye is so

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Crazy because he wants such specific things

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
But think about it he was doing the same thing

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And so the list was like

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Don't make eye contact, it was like a really specific

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
List of things that human art should do

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
At a party

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I kind of get it if you're going to go through the threshold

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
As I would never of using humans as

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Art I understand

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Like having a very meticulous list

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Of like I want to do something really specific here

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Like where every five seconds

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
You all go

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Or I want you all

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
To coordinate

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Emotionally I want you all to feel

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Washed out

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Right? Yeah

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Is that like humans doing something

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Not natural

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It should be like a screen saver

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Where you're like okay they're doing this again

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It's floating

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
He was like padding the water

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And making little splishies

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
With the beat

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I love hip hop all day long

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And it was like somebody stun him

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
He must have been good

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Tape a

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Tape a taser to one of these sticks

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Because he was showing humanity

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
And that breaks your heart

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Exactly

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Because then it becomes

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Now you're at a party with strangers

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Some of whom can't get out of the pool

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
As opposed to

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Being at a party where humans are

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Yes exactly

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Do you think any of these people in the pool

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Knew that there was actually a hero in their midst

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Who was contemplating joining that

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Somebody had come to the party

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Against all odds to save

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I know a kindred spirit when I see one

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And this guy you know what else he did

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Kenny Powers walked by

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And all of a sudden he started going

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
He was the only one of the pool people

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
He just started going we're not worthy

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
We're not worthy and I was like

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
That's the fucking dork

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And then a beat later I was like

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
That's me

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I'm that pool guy

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I felt like when they were getting their pictures

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
With people it was toward the end of the party

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And it was like people charging out of the field

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
After like a soccer game or something

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
You got five minutes

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
You're fucking autographs

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I get the fuck out

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I think it's time

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
For me to bring back a little plot point

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
In our story

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
So just when you go through

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
The first threshold

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
And you wait in the first level

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Of purgatory and then the second level

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
And then the hot dog's coming

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
You finally get into what you think

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Is the promised land

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And you wander around and you're like

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
More Game of Thronesers and you know

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
You're just rubbing up against them and you don't care

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And there's the guys from Arrow and it's like

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
A living wax museum

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And all I'm doing with my buddy

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Who's never even met a celebrity

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Just like look at that person

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
There's one goddamn room

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And I'm like well I'm in

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I worked hard for this I'm going everywhere

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I'm going to use the whole buffalo in this party

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And I walked up to this fucking room

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
And I look in this room

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Emergency exit

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
And there's two giant dudes

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Staying there but they could have been just regular guys

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I couldn't quite tell they weren't polo shirts

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And I look past them

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
And I see James Cameron

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Oh yeah

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
There was one more level of elite

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Inside this fucking concentric

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Circle of eliteness

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Just when you think we're all one now

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
We're all the Hollywood elite

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Fuck everybody else

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Is he alone in the room or what's his little air

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
He has no equals

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
He's waiting for Steve Jobs

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Coast like floated

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Before he can have a conversation

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
He's the loneliest guy in showbiz

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Everybody knows that

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Heavy lies in the crowd

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It's celebrity Highlander

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Like yeah

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
But actually there was a point

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
When there was a whistle and a wave and the pool guy got up

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And went into the James Cameron room

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And he's like that guy's good

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
The one that had pleased him with his rapping

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Bring me the spry lad

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
He's like so you're comfortable in water for that long

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
How much for the pool people

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Just cut to the Eli Roth thing with James Cameron

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And a fucking ivory bathtub

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
The kids like dangling and chained over him

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And he takes like this scythe

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
You exist in the water

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Rubbing himself in his blood

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Ah

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And there's a speakerphone in the corners

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
There's his agent going like okay so Avatar 3

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Do you do IMAX

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Or are we going direct to

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Smake, smake, smake, smake

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
What?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Why are you, what is happening to you

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I'm smacked, smacked, smacked, smacked

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I gotta go

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Wait I want to follow that guy's story

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Smacked, smacked, smacked, smacked, smacked

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
He's on the phone he's like

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I can't represent James anymore

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I'm losing my mind

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
There goes Todd, he can barely speak

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
But he's James Cameron's agent

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Doing great

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
What are you going to do

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Smacked, smacked, smacked, smacked

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
By the way

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
If you haven't guessed already

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
That was the room that he yelled

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
About the hot dogs in 2

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Oh

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Hot bags

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Yeah

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
James Cameron heard me rubbing those hot dogs

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Right in his fucking face

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
This never happened to me at a party before

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I was at one point

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Spencer Crittenden

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Who is summer on Rick and Morty

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Her husband, get this

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
He's an Irish firefighter

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Spoiler

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Yeah

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
You didn't picture it

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
It's like how much more manly can you get

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
He looks like an underwear model

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Who's also an Irish firefighter

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
He didn't quite understand

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
But after a while he was like you're right

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I was like no I'm sure Irish fires are harder to fight

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
What do you mean

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
The timbers different

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I was like no the fucking

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Your people are different

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
They've been through the worst

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
They're more extreme

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I'm sure one of the Irish houses on fire

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
The fire is just a couple degrees hotter

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
And harder to put out

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
There's certainly more flammable fluids around

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I wasn't connecting

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Those dots

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I was praising

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Their

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Be set upon history

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
And heritage

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I turned out not to be Irish

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I said in my DNA I'm fucking British

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
You are no Irish

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I'm Irish

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I thought you were doing an IRA joke

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Because he's Northern Irish

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Why would I do that

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I think he

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
He says the wrong things all the time

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Why would you ever think that I

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Would put my foot in my mouth

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Speaking of which

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I want to play this recording before I forget

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
This is my girlfriend Cody

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
This is

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
This is

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I don't know if this is going to translate

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I just can't get it

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
You have a song stuck in your head

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Like they say

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
If you make it be in other people's head

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
That's how you get rid of it

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
It follows or something

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I just have her

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Her childhood voice

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Stuck in my head because she's in the bathtub

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And her dad's trying to get her to get out

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
But she's trying to get her dad to

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Eat soap

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Lather

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
She's handing him a plate

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Is this from an old childhood video

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
That you watched a lot of her?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
She did this yesterday with her

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
One of my favorite things

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Is my girlfriend's channeling video

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I forgot that detail

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
This is the home movie of hers

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
She's 12 years younger than me

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
She's a baby

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
But it's like

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I know that model of camcorder

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
It's not wonder years

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Footage where she's moving fast

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And there's no audio

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
It's fucking

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Shit, I did channel 101 videos

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
That her dad's using to taper

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Naked

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
She's a child

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
But these things get stuck in your head

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
It's like

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
What are you going to do? I'm emotionally

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I have a very low IQ

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Emotionally

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
That means

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I can date

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I can date younger people because I work very hard

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And I haven't matured

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
You've still been talking

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And you're still like it's fine

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
She likes me and I like her

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Dan forgot we were here for a while

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I'm trying to find the

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
How do you make

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
How do you make the speaker

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Thing go

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
12 years older than his girlfriend

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Do you have to plug her in?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
How do you do it?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
It automatically is on speaker

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Where do you put the fuel in?

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Alright

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Oh shit, I already fucked up

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I scrubbed the thing

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
We're going to have to do it live

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Cody, get up here

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
We're going live people

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
This is her telling her dad to eat

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
The soap suds

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Eat it

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Eat it okay

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Eat it

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Eat it

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Eat that

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Eat left

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Eat this

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Eat it

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Eat it

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Did you eat it? Yes

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
That was so cute

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
She was 12 years old then?

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
She says she's 27

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
She

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
She says eat it 5,000 times

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Did you eat it?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Maybe the visuals are important

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I don't know

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
She turns and goes did you eat it?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And he goes yeah

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And she goes okay

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
But then he's like okay

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Now get out of the tub

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I ate it

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And then she's like just delaying

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
She likes being in the empty tub so much

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
That she does now is just like

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
She peed and so now she has to clean up

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
She's saying you can't see anything

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
There's no pee on camera but she's like pushing something

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
She's going I have to

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
She just wants to stay in the tub

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
So she invents a tub emergency

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
A tub emergency

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Wait so that audio gets stuck in your head?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Yeah I just keep hearing her go eat it

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Did you eat it?

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Every time I eat

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I just hear her like eat it

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And I'm like alright

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
If she only knew that one day

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
She would be with someone who

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Diane I'm sorry that was cute and all

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
But do you have anything else on the agenda?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I wanted to take a little here

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
You know I'm sure Alia

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
She was acting at such a young age

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Here's a projection I'm making

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It's like you in order to survive with your sanity

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
This silly business

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
You've had to

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Become

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Pretty well balanced

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Or your alternative was to

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Knock it over liquor stores

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Just to get my high

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
So you've had

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
A long ago

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
You had to deal with some threshold where you're like

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
The only hope for survival

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Psychologically is to know

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
That all this stuff is horseshit

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
So it's a bad timing

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
It's bad that this would be your episode

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Talking about rock climbing

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
We're talking about

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Which I also do

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I can do 11a if anyone knows top roping

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I can get as high as 11a

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
That's like maybe like bowling

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
200 so

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
I don't want to talk about rock climbing ever

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Is that the indoor rock climbing thing?

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
That's your god damn right

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I did level zeros and ones

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
So rock climbing conversations

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
That's in bouldering

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Nobody knows about rock climbing in this fucking room

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
I'm in the wrong

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Room

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
But I'll continue

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
You know what

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
We'll find you the right room

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
That party wasn't the only

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Climbing I do

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I just came to me

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I was like that's a

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Rock climbing

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Social climbing at the Hollywood parties

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Just want to make sure everybody got it

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Eat it

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Did you eat it?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Did you eat it?

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Did you eat it?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Can I tell a story?

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
That was my point I wanted to add some humanity

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Because I'm sure if you're not in Hollywood

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
You're probably into babies

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Wait wait did someone say no

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
The story

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
These parties have a strong context

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
For me in that way

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Who are you identify yourself?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
They don't have to identify themselves

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Why not?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
It's your insecurity it's not their problem

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I'm about to tell

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
What I think is probably one of the

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Don't hype it up too much

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Don't hype it up too much

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
No you're doing great man

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Ryan I've known you for many years now

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I would say

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
We don't really hang out enough

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I've never seen you so aggressive before

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
You're a little more aggressive

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
No he's like this

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
He's like George Costanza

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I'm a rock climber Jerry

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I can't do the voice

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I'm going to tell you I learned something

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I've known Jeff

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
For 12 years

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I've known Dan for 12 years

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I've worked with Dan

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Probably 50,000 million hours

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
On a few different things

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
He's just a really slow writer

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I've known Spencer

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
For about a year and a half

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Two years this guy fucking gets me

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
He gets me more than you do

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
That's not your fault I work with him

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
He should get me

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
How do you think I'm assessing you at the moment?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Sometimes you get me

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
What the fuck

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Is this his friend here

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Who is this guy

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I get Ridley because I'm like

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Light gray and then he's like

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Just the slightly

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Darker shade of gray

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Like I could be him on a bad day

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Or a good day

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Yeah

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I could be him on a bad day

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Or I could be him

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
If I was having a bad day

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
You have to know where the commas are

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And that's it

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Wait, so what's the

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Yeah, what's the

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
What happened at the party

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Everything I've said

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
This whole shtick I'm doing

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
It's all to hoist myself up

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
In the ultimate patard

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
And you're all like

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Most of the audience I could tell doesn't like me

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Believe me, the no girl is just the brave one

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Doesn't bother me

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
I know I've got some people who are like

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
What are you talking about

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
And you're like in the Spencer camp

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Let's hear some claps

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Thank you

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Please clap

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
So we all

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Love meeting

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Your Game of Thronesers

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
We all love meeting your

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
EWs and your Will Fortes

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And whatnot

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
But I'm about to tell you a story

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
That is going to high road everybody

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
On this stage and in this room

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Tee it up

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Just a little higher

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
You're a high dive act

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Ryan is a high dive act

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Where the ladder goes up so high

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
That the thing you show up to see

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Is him fainting

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
You don't even get to see it

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
You just know it happened

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Like someone radios down

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Yeah, he fainted

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I was wondering

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
What he was going to jump into

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
There's a cup of water

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
There's a guy rapping

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
If you guys

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Don't give me the right answer

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
To the question I'm about to ask you

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Jesus Christ

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
I'm going to shame you all

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
So just be prepared

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I'm empirically going to be the hero

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And you, whoever does not know

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
The answer to my question are going to be the villains

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I was on the Comic-Con panel

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
For and I wanted to get something

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Signed by Berkeley Breadth

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
At Bloom County

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
That's not the person I want you to care about yet

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Can I guess the answer before you ask?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Sure

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
The Colorado River

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
We'll get there

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I say I'm going to go meet

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Berkeley Breadth and get something signed

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Creative Bloom County's big inspiration to me

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
At 3 o'clock

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I walked to the IDW booth

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Where he was signing things

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Turn on the corner

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Who do I see sitting there?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Representative John Lewis

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Who

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Doesn't know who that is

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Well no one's going to admit it because we know

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
We know a trap of it

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I didn't know who this was

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I don't know who it is

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Alright, yeah, who is he?

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
No idea

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Yes, Booyah

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Civil Rights Movement

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Civil Rights Movement

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
He was the Civil Rights Movement

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
You met the Civil Rights Movement?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I feel like

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
That backfired

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I really thought that I could shame you guys for not knowing

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
But you guys are celebrating the fact that you don't know who this is

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Yes, he was part of the Civil Rights Movement

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
This is what no one knows all about

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
You teed that up in the only way

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
That would make it possible for us to celebrate

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Not knowing a Civil Rights Leader

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Can we take this again?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
He was the lesser of two evils to stomp on you

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
He wasn't at the EW party, have we already left that place?

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
No, this is earlier on the floor

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
So I see Representative John Lewis

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
He was part of the Civil Rights Movement

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
You can see pictures of him marching with

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Martin Luther King Jr

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
He was portrayed in the movie Selma

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Ever heard of it?

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Okay

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Where was I going with this?

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Did I have a point?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
He was also the face of

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Remember a little something called

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
The Democrats trying to get the gun rights

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Shit passed a couple weeks ago

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
And the sit in and the all night thing

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
He was the face of that

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Why is he if you guys are like

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Fuck the 60s

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
That happened at the convention hall

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
You wanted to talk about

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Getting into the party, the EW party

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
That's more important things

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
This is the epilogue, dude

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
You just really wanted to

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Okay, alright

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Did you hang out with him?

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Did you guys have a drink together?

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Who was telling this story? This isn't an interview

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
This is a tale I'm unfolding at my own pace

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Okay

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I thought that was the end of the story

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I hit plot points, I don't stop and go

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Do you guys have any questions about what the booth looked like

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Or what I was wearing now

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
You tell the story properly

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I think Dan, you do

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
I know Ryan

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
What happened? I missed something

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I was in my head

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
So you see him and what do you do

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
You go, well none of this matters because this guy

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Actually did something

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Berkeley breathed, he bites the gun

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
The only thing that matters is this guy

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Does something

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
That's a better picture

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
That's a title for the episode

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
That's a title for the episode

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
So I gotta shake this guy's hands

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
For real, I gotta shake this guy's hands

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
He's a part of history

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
So I go up and I see the guy

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I go the end of the line

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
The line guy, cousins of these people

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Who don't let us in anywhere

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Says, I'm sorry, the line's cut off, no more people

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Fuck, I wanna meet John Lewis

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I wanna shake the hand of history

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
The wave last night, I wanna do the opposite

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
I wanna balance the scales

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Carmically

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
So I say to the guy, can I please

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Meet Mr. Lewis, and he goes, the line's cut off

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
No exceptions, and I go, fuck, I gotta do it

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
I gotta do it, and I go

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Do you know the show Rick and Morty?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Yeah, I saw your badge

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
I know

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Which was pretty cool

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Pretty cool

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Then he says

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
He continues to say

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
The line is closed

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Go on

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And I was like, fuck, he wasn't gonna let me in

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
The story's gonna get

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
There's more twists coming

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I know it sounds you guys are like

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
His mouth is getting dry, he's getting nervous

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
We definitely did not think that

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
This is why

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
You heard a booming magical voice

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Off camera say

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Let that young man do as he pleases

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Let that man balance the scales

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
He was born in a country that may not

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Always keep its eye toward its dreams

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
And the camera swivels over

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
And it's Stephen Hawking

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
The guy, I walked away

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Having been rejected, my Rick and Morty

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Credibility, the only shred of what I have

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Was not a currency I could use to meet John Lewis

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Right, one second

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Dan, it's now a bad time to do our ad for me, Andes

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Can I get to the

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Okay, yes

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
When I ended the cliffhanger, I was not allowed to meet John Lewis

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Oh, yeah, that's great

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
No, no, no, no, no, the cliffhanger, then there's gonna be a commercial

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
What could happen next?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
We'll have to find out

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I hope that while Ryan was waiting in the exhibit hall

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
He was wearing comfortable underwear

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
I mean, if you go to

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
To a convention hall and you're wearing

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Less than the most comfortable underwear

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
In the world

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I mean, you're

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Your own worst enemy

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Being you

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Man, lady, or

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Any part of the continuum on which we exist

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Gender-wise

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
That was close

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
The slippery shark

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Yeah

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
He's falling asleep

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
That's a thing

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
But I really could never get past the history channel thing

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I always called it the history channel

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
John Lewis also has a new show on history, I guess

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
As Dan Harmon, I end up in a lot of

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Sticky situations

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
But my underwear

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Is anything but

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
It stays smooth

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Like an 80s chamois

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
When I run my hand

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Across my fanny

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
If you're listening from the United Kingdom

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
That means

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
But

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I think it means vagina

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I'm telling the British people

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Sorry

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Sorry

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
In my soft, silky

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Silky sounds like

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Let me tell you about meundies

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I want to explain

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Something to you that

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
You may not have known

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
We've been living in a marginalized

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
World

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I'm not saying it's the matrix

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
We don't know what's a simulation

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
And what isn't, but we do know that

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
In reality, we are being marginalized

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Point

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
If you drink

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
7-up

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Every time you experience anxiety

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
And it makes you feel better

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
You're going to form an addiction to 7-up

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Your neurology is going to form a relationship

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
With the things that provide it comfort

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
And as time goes on

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
It gets more and more complicated

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
It comes a point when you don't know

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
If what you're doing is what you want to do

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
What you need to do

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
You won't even be able to tell the difference

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
For those of you who have ever

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Known someone with an addiction

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
You don't know whether you want

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
To do something or whether you think

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
You want to do something

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
My point being that

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Like

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Why did I go down that road?

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
You're doing an advertising

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
You were talking about your poopy underwears

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Well

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Wait

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
It should occur to you

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
That oh my god

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
If it's possible to have a weird relationship

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
With video games

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Or alcohol

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Or a certain restaurant

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Where something becomes like a compulsion

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
An addiction

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Can you imagine the things that you're not being told

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Have been baked into your neurology

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
By a generation

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
That was already raised in artifice

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
That was here well before you got here

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
And was in charge of everything you ever saw or heard

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
You can imagine the possibility therefore

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
That it is

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Possible for you to live on a limited

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Plane of existence with absolutely

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
No consciousness of what you could be

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Enter me undies

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Wow

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
The underwear company that stood back

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
And said what is underwear

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Like why does it feel

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
The way it feels

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
In a sea of people I'm sure

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
That no longer worked there

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
And said

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
It's not that complicated bro

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I'm a fucking sexist pig

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I don't work at me undies

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I'm a piece of shit

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
What's it matter bro

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
If it ain't bro Ken don't fix it bro

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I'm a bro

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
That was beautiful

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Don't bro

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Can fix it bro

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
And me undies took those people

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
And they just put them in the airlock

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
And as their silent screams

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Fell on no ears but their own

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
They were flushed into space

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Their body succumbed to the vacuum

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
That pre-existed time

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
And they were dealt with the way God

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Deals with

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
With

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
You know bros

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
And then the only people left

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Where people that

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Live within a world where

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Underwear can be more comfortable

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Than you thought possible

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Are they promoting the show or something

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Maybe, I guess

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
We're promoting Dan

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Don't be so cynical

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Dan's just passionate about his underwear

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I love me undies, that's the only undies I wear

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
For real?

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
If you go to meundies.com

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Slash feral audio

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
That you get 20% off your first pair

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
And if you don't like them

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Hey, guess what

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
You will

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Let's say you're a stupid person

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
From an alien planet of stupid people

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Who doesn't like the undies

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Made out of the softest fabric

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
You've ever had, they're free

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
You get to keep them, you can do whatever you want with them

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
You can wash your car with them

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
I love it, I love meundies

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
You might be sold at me

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
I happen to wear meundies as well

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
And I'm not uncomfortable

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Talking about their quality

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I don't have to put my tongue in my cheek

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Because I'm not comfortable shilling

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
I'm more than comfortable shilling for meundies

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I'm not putting my tongue in my cheek

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
They're incredibly comfortable

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Modal fabric, look it up

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Modal?

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Isn't as like

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Twice as comfortable as regular underwear stuff

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
That's the head of meundies

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Modal

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Modal

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Wait, are there meundies people in the audience?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Do we got any meundies?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
There's this whole audience

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
You're wearing meundies, throw them up

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I think a lot of these people are probably wearing meundies

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Because weird travels fast

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
When an undergarment is like

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Stepping into God's mouth

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Is it

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Only your genitals

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Ryan, Alia, Dan

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
You're all fans of meundies

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Is it true that meundies was created by pirates?

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Pirates?

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
It feels like they were

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Where's meundies?

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
From what I've read

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
You get different information from different websites

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
But it was a fabric

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Stolen from an old pirate chest

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
One large piece of fabric

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Not a lot of undies left

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Well, it never runs out

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
A pirate chest

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Okay

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
So you finally made it

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Into the last level of the EW party

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Let me tell you something

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
The last thing I'm going to say about meundies

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Was the last thing

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
95% of my underwear is meundies

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Because I was like, fuck, get this shit out of the way

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Fucking hains in

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
I went to full 95%

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Every now and then there's laundry

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Why hang on to that other five?

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Because you never know

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Someone threw away underwear

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
You can find out that meundies

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
The company was all paid for by Nazi gold

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
You don't know that

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Or it's laced with mercury

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
That's why it's so comfortable

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Actually, it's made out of healthy babies

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I happen to not be wearing

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Meundies right now

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I'm wearing Calvin Klein's

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
You're paying for it

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Because I wear meundies

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
On nights

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
When I know there's going to be

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Action

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Well, sex?

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
God damn it, sex

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
After your performance tonight

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
We know that tonight is not one of those nights

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And good

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Because I'm wearing Calvin Klein's tonight

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Because I wear the 5%

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
When I'm fucking podcast

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Yes

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Treat your other regions

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Like

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Like it's a

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Like you're not

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Ryan Ridley

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
On a podcast

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Like every night is a special night

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
They're soft, I would want to counter that

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Ryan, because I don't want to create an ad campaign

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Where people are like, oh

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
These are my fuck underwear

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
These are not, you don't

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
I

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Meundies is when you just want to feel like

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
You're fucking your underwear

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
They're fine with that

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I've heard their ad campaigns, they're absolutely fine with that

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
People associate

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
The whole fucking thing

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
With the opposite of comfort

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Like, oh, I'm going to wear these shoes because they make my ass look good

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
But that's not what I wear when I'm hanging out

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
On a Sunday, I'm saying wear your meundies

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
And this is great for all occasions

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Let these other podcasts

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
That you're talking about

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
How fuckable they are

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I'd like to talk about how they're good for hanging out

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And itching your butt

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Which is how you lead

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Into sex

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
99% of the time I'm just hanging out

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
So yeah

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
When you itch your butt in meundies

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
It's like a doctor put on those clean sterile gloves

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
And like is itching

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Your butt for you

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Because it's like a smooth

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Ridgeless finger

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Dan, when you put on a pair of meundies

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Do you reflexively just start touching one of your nipples?

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Yeah

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
At the comic con thing I talked about this

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I went and got a testicular exam

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And while the doctor was like

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Like

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Fooling around

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Not fooling around

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I was fooling around

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
He was hard at work

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
He was doing this for his kids

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
He wasn't like

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
He didn't come up with this idea

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
I came in there

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
And just like check him

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
And then while he was doing it

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I like caught myself

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I rubbed my nipple

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
With my thumb

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
To make the most out of it

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
I was like

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I caught myself doing it

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
And then he fixed my hair

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
He's like

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Wouldn't be the first time

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
It was really weird because I wasn't

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Turned on that I know of

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
But

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Scratching your butthole does lead to

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
You know, excitement

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I think in general

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
This is a guy checking me

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
For cancer in my balls

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
But

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Cody, my girlfriend

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
When we were in Canada

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Have you

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Tell me if I'm crying

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Have you ever done the thing

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Did you ever want to aim

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
A man's

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
While he's peeing

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Like to aim it around

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Just once

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I've only been in a committed relationship once

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
The only time I felt comfortable

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
To ask for control

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
You've only been in one committed relationship

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And you took that opportunity to

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Aim as P

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I think that's enough for me

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Mission accomplished

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
You might be the last

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
He checks it

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Everyone's like

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
You're

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Are you okay?

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
He wants to know

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
He'd be so excited

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
To see you

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Get married

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I thought I ruined her

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
With my weird pee pee

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
No, it wasn't that

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I have asked to aim it

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
We always wonder what it's like

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
We did that one morning

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
He let her

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Aim it

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I think the next day

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
He said

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
You were touching your nipple

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
When I did that

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I thought she was lying

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Why would I do that

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
It wasn't a sexual thing

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
How would you notice touching your nipple

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Naturally put your hand up

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I think it's got to be a comfort thing

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
It's a security thing

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I believe me

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
I'm all over this thing during sex

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
The nipple

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Why is this happening

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Either is fine

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
But

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Anyways

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Meundies are comfortable

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
We love meundies

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
It's good

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
But then I noticed it

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
It's worth noting

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Fade up on the floor of Comic-Con

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Where we last left our intrepid hero

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
He was trying to John Lewis

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
The civil rights activist

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Autograph

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
But he couldn't

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
By lording over the fact

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
That he worked on the amazing show

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Rick and Morty

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Thank you

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
So as he was walking away

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I said I get a tap in my shoulder

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Ryan come here

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Okay

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Mr. Lewis we got one more guy

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Can you please

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
This is the guy who controls the line

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
The gatekeeper

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I think his heart

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Yeah exactly

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
He looked at my gate

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
He got me

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
You guys certainly would not have done this for me

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Trust me

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
He's like I feel bad for that guy

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
He's clearly got some fucking problems

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
So he goes come here

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Takes me over to John Lewis

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Look him in the eye shake his hand

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Thank you so much for everything you've done

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
He goes just trying to make the world a better place

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
He didn't really say that I had to punch up his line

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I swear it was the essence of that

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
He was like so what show are you working on

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
He said like some crazy anti-semitic thing

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
You're like really protecting this guy

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
He just launched

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
He wasn't even John Lewis

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
So I go

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
That was amazing

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
It really was I walked away

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I'm being completely sincere I'm going to drop this character I'm doing

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
I mean that was amazing I was buzzing inside

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
It felt great I shook

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
The hand of a man who shook the hand of Martin Luther King Jr

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Marched in Selma

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
All that stuff

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
This is the highlight of Comic Con

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Fuck the EW party fuck the Game of Thrones shit

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
So I think

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
That guy he hooked me up he did me a favor

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
He knew who I was

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
He saw my name and he must know the show

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
So I go and we do a signing

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
And I say to Justin

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Can you write on this card that we're signing

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
For everybody it's a picture from the show

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Can you just write

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Thank you for letting Ryan meet John Lewis

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Justin Orlin

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
You got this photo

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
You were going to find this guy to give it to him

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Thank you Alia

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
I think you're finding out

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
It's Alia

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Nicaragua

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I'm not going to get too real by that

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Nicaragua

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
So I get the card signed by Justin

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Fight my way back

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Through the madness that is the convention floor

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Takes me 40 minutes to get from

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Whatever one end of the other

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Full of Hollywood elites

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
He doesn't care anymore

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
But now he doesn't care now he just sees them as green letters

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
He's like

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Jenny McBride is just a pie symbol

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Who's cascading like a waterfall

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
He's like hey you want to hang out

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
He's like no I don't care about your hands

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Joss Whedon Joss Hooten

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I rift that

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
So

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Wait Dan you didn't stay at home all night

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Writing that joke

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
You got that in your pocket

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I did not have that in my pocket

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I was much too highly crafted

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
But you can just

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Rift number 14

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
You're working your way through the crowd

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
With this delicately signed

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Photo in the air

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
The great Justin Roiland

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
And by the way

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
I have to throw my bosses under the bus all the time

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Because I'm insecure

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
So I go to the convention floor

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And I go back to the booth

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
And I don't see this guy

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Now I know what he looks like

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Also how many hours later is this

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
No wonder he's not there

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
He was working the booth all day

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
These aren't the Hollywood elites

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
They don't just come and go

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Flights of fancy oh it's the next hot party

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
They're fucking working

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
John Lewis probably has a lot of shit to do

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
No no, not John Lewis the guy who helped me get the

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Why is he like

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
He wrote a graphic novel

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
He wrote a graphic novel called March

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
About his history doing the civil rights movement

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
He wrote it?

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
He wrote some other people

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
He wrote most of it

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Graphic novel

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
That's what I got signed

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
I got a signed copy

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
But get your own

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I like graphic novelizations of stuff that I would never

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
You know

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Like that mouse thing

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Or there was like

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Biographies of Freud and stuff

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
That I've looked at that were in comic book form

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I'm probably not going to read it

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
But I got it signed by John Lewis

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Anyway the point is I go to the booth

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And I can't see the guy

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
But I know what he looks like

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Like I really want to give him to this

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
And move on, I got other

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
So I'm like I can't see him

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
So finally I go to somebody works at the booth

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
And I go hey so I explain the whole story

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
I go this guy I don't know what his name is

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
But he hooked me up with John Lewis's signature

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
And like I think he likes the show

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I work on I got him this and so

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
I don't know who he is but

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
He's a bigger guy

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
With glasses

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
And she looks me in the eye

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
And she goes I don't know who you're talking about

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I go

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
He's a guy with glasses

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
A little bit bigger

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
You mean Joel

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
The shorter guy

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Was this guy black?

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
No

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
That's what I was thinking

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
No

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
This is the key moment of the story

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I was trying to say

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
He was big, he had glasses

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I didn't know his name

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
She goes maybe Joel

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
But he's the shorter guy

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Does anyone know what's going on here with this woman

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
What she's doing? She's shaming me

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Because I described him as the bigger guy

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
We need to know though

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Something that only you know right now

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
And she

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
When you say bigger

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Describe tell us the description of this guy

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Because we don't know if he's nine feet tall or not

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
He's nine feet tall

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
You meant fat

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
He was stocky

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I don't know he was physically bigger

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I didn't know what else to say

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
That was it

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
He was a white guy with glasses

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I didn't know what else to say

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
You just described 80% of the people a Comic Con

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
How many of them are working at this booth

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
But she looked at me

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
She goes you mean the shorter guy

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
The shorter guy

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
So it's okay to call him the shorter guy

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
That's the correct dimension

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
To focus on

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
She's like sir I'm just trying to help you spine this guy

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Height is cool

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Height is cool but I can't

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Right?

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
It's my pet peeve when people tell me

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I'm over thinking or I'm projecting it to my head

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
But you

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I really think that you're

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I believe that what you

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
The piece that you're missing is that she is actually

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
She knows six

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
People

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
And you said bigger

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
And she said

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
She was diplomatic

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
She means tall big

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
By bigger do you mean the fat one

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
She was just skirting the issue

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Dan do you not think I know when people

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Don't like me

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
She was

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Looking me in the eye and saying the words

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
You mean the shorter one

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Trust me

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Why would I tell this story

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
If it was like I knew

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
There was ten percent of a chance that I'm this delusional maniac

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Of Tarantino and Dustle Don

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I see Juliette Lewis saying

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Eat my pussy and I, that's not really what she said

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
She said something else, yes she was shaming me

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
I still don't think James Cameron saw you yell about hot dogs

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
That's the point of delusions

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Is that you don't know

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Also I bet all of you know

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
This is all going on in your head and she's like showing you pictures

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
She's like this guy this guy and you're like

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
She thinks I'm crazy she thinks I'm this

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
And then she's like hello anybody

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Alright well here he is

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
All I'm saying is

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
If I knew three guys

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
And one was tall and skinny

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
And one was short and fat

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
And one was tall and bigger

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
All around

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
And you were trying to

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Someone said the bigger guy

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
I think the tall guy

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Knowing me with my foot in my mouth I go the fat one

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
I don't know but I'm saying

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Given that situation

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
The best like most courteous way of

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
That's all I'm saying

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
But I think

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I will believe you

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
If you simply tell me

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Because you just keep saying she's saying the shorter one

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
But what I want to hear from you is

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
You're saying regardless of her words

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
It was very clear from her face

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Very clear

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Judging you

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
As clear as she was

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Girl

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
How dare you

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
You're not using that language

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
You're not so sensitive about it

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
It's like well look different it's okay

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Thank you that's the point of the

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
High five finally

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
I'm not going to ask for a high five from any of you

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Because you're still like who the fuck is this guy

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Also they're far away

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
It would be awkward

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Was she dress slutty?

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
I was just trying to trick him

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
While we have him like placid

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Like he'd be like yeah she was dress slutty

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Actually yeah she was just like okay

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
You got me

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Like you don't know what's right and what's wrong

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
I'm just reprogramming you

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Listen the arc of the story if we've all forgotten

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Is I meet a civil rights hero

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I decided to do the guy of favor

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Who hooked me up with that

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
You're xenophobic

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
But I mean

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
You came back looking for a big old fatty

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
There were two guys who worked at the booth

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
And they were both five foot two

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
What do you mean the shorter one

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
What happened from letter

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Did you let that stop you?

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Of course not

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Just like I'm not going to let any of this stop me

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Telling the story

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Not even our 30 minute me and these commercial

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Could stop the story

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
So finally she says

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
You mean

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
The shorter one and I just go

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Yeah the fucking shorter one

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
She goes that's Joel he's right over there

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I'm like there he is that big fucking fat

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Motherfucker

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Take that goddamn soft pretzel out of your hand

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
And take this Rick and Morty signed fucking postcard

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
God damn pig thank you for letting me be John Lewis

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I've been Ryan Ridley goodnight

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Did he

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Did he

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Receive it

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
As well as his weird

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Interesting

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Spectromy whatever you would describe yourself

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Kind of liking me not liking me

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
All that shit

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
But stuff you always talk about yourself

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
He was like you

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I didn't know if he liked me or didn't like me

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Was he thankful for

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
He was like thank you very much

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Did we ever find out if he actually was a Rick and Morty fan

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Well he said he saw my name

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
And if you're not a Rick and Morty fan

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Well I would interpret that as look

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
If there was anything worth knowing about

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
You'd be on your fucking lacquer

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
He's literally just being like I see what's written on your lacquer

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Yeah exactly you don't have to waste my fucking

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Time with this shit

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I've been reading lacquers all day

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
I live within hierarchy I know how

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
You're wearing a resume on your chest

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
I know how human chess works

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
I know you're a bishop I get it

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Can I say the only part of regret about this entire night

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Is the way I described him

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
He was very nice he wasn't what I was saying

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
I'm saying that because I'm repeating what Dan

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Is always saying in the writer's room

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Do you mean the spectromy part

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Yeah all that stuff you're always saying that stuff

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
And it's gotten in my head I'm just like spouting it off

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
You know I learned from watching you

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
So I'm very sorry to everybody in their audience

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Everybody watching he received it well

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
He was very nice you know

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
He was a little weird

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
But what do you want me to say at this point

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
I honestly didn't know

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
What was your problem

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I don't

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
I don't want to say he was fat

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
But when he walked around

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
The conventions that are

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
He walked around

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
In comparison to

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Alia

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Alia

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
I'm trying different shit out

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Comedy comes in threes when there's a vowel

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
It's pronounced three ways

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Is there anything we talked about

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
You're like we're looking forward

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
To it on TBS no longer very funny

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Just TBS

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Look the

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
God damn it I already forgot

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
The fucking cock fucking shit name

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Search party

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
God damn it

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Why can't you name it Pokemon

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
So I can remember

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Is that still valuable anymore

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Is it like over now

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Like a rare super spike

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Because it was like holy shit

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
And then with all the fires

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
The world's about to end

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Everything's happening so quickly

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Rising and falling within one breath

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
It's almost like it was a symptom

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Of that level of

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Heightness itself

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
My therapist says

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
You're up at that setting

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
That was the only environment in which

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
This Pokemon thing could have like

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Either it's because we wanted a distraction

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Or it's because

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
We were just so fucking amped up

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
And that game was about being kind of

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
I'm not saying it was random

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Like it would have been about toothpicks

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
I mean it was obviously a game that had its

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
But it's also people who have the memory of it too

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Like the young people now knowing

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
But it's like an overnight now it's done

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
It was like five articles a day

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
It's already crescendoed

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
It's already crescendoed

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Is there one up here right now

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Oh this is a joke

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
This is crawling within a ran

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
This comic book story

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Is more Jim than it will ever be

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Where's my red team at

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Fuck you guys

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
I don't play it

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
I'm kidding

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Blue

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Yellow

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Green

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
One dude

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
So we have to take to the streets of Donald Trump becomes president

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
These teams will be the fighting forces

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Okay

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
So really remember your colors

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
You will have to fight

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Spencer you guys are saying

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
You feel like this has run its course

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I'm only talking about the press

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
That's all

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
My friend told me about it at dinner

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
He was like you hear about this Pokemon thing

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
And I was like no what are you talking about

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Literally within moments every 20 minutes

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
More and more people like exponentially

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
That's the thing it's all exponentially growing

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
I was just talking about the news cycle

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Like it was a quarter

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Of all press

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Usually if something like that happens

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
There's a little more of a bell curve

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
There's money here

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
You know you ring it dry

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
But this was just like

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
There's a shit fuck ton of money for two days here

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
For the press and then it was like

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Fuckin' Trump

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
They just like fucking spasm

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
About Pokemon and it peaked

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Literally there was a headline that says

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Trump says he hasn't played Pokemon yet

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Here's the article that was marked

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
The spearhead of that stalagmite

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
It was like shot up through the roof

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Of the cave into God's eye

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Like Trump hasn't

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Played Pokemon yet

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
New York Times

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
And people were just like

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Because there was the article about how they were playing it

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
To the Holocaust Museum was asking

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Like look

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
I'm not one of these this isn't news

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
People like that in all the comment sections

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Dude why is this news

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Your dumb is why

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Why is the comment section your blog

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Because you're fucking stupid that's why this is news

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
You fucking parasite

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Like stop comment

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Why would you log in

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
You need an account to say

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Why is this news

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Do something about it

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
With wheat paste

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Or a bottle or something

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Make a gas mask out of it

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Get visceral about it

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Did you say visceral

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Get visceral

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
I've been feeding you already

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
We have a 20 year confession to make

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
About what we've been doing

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Why we've never been on stage at the same time

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
She's your serenity

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Ellie has been piloting me

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Like in the 80's

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
When there was that monkey that could

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Drive a car and it was the trainer

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Was driving it while laying down

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
You mean an huge revolution

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Yeah I think they had to do those

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Effects they did

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Anyways let's wrap this up

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
What was I talking about

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Stay on target

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
I was talking about Pokemon

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
The Holocaust Museum piece

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
The last paragraph of the

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Article

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Why is this news

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
The truth is if you just put cell phones

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
In place of any of those articles

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
That's all it was

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Woman gets carjacked while playing Pokemon

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
She was using her cell phone

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
She was playing Pokemon

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
It was just ubiquity

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
That's

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
You're clicking on these articles

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Like oh Pokemon is so important

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
And the cause of people killing themselves

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
It's like no everyone's doing it with their phones

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Before that

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Guy uses Instagram before he

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Like joins a race gang

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Right

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
It just wasn't news because it wasn't

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
But do you think it's Pokemon

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
The reason why people

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Like is because it does physically

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Make you look for things

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
You're actually walking around

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
So the Holocaust Museum said

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Please just can you

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Not Pokemon while you're looking at the piles

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
We're trying

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
There's something for sale here and it's not

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Do you think the Holocaust Museum is

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Not what you're buying

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Do you think the Holocaust Museum is like a gym or a poke stop

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
It was a poke stop because they were like

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
They use landmarks and stuff and there's only so many landmarks

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
That would bother to say can you please not

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Have Jesus Christ

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
You know who didn't have any problem

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
The Tolerance Museum

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
What is that by the way

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Jeff I should clarify

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
This isn't the Holocaust Museum

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
That loves Holocaust

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
I think it is a form of

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Tolerance Museum

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
I don't know how many Holocaust Museums

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Are there like

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
A simpler time

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Join me

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Won't you

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
I'm Harry Holocaust

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
We don't agree with everything that happened back then

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
We're just saying

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
People had lemonade

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Like take a trip back

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
With us and it's all like there's T-shirts

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
No it was a

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
It's the Holocaust Museum

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
So the article is just

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
It's a non-news piece because it's just like

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
They're just going can we not be a poke stop

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Like obviously we shouldn't be a poke stop

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Because there's people there's Nitterans

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
There's people running and they're going like

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
And so the only article was just like

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
They're asking you to please not do that

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
But then I know

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I know it was a fake quote it had to be a fake

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Quote because the last paragraph was

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
It's not like

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
We came here to play the game

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Says Annie 37

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Or something I can't remember her name

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I remember the age was 37 because it just sounds like a fake age

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
It sounds like they're like we don't want it to be

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Like it just sounds fake

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Whose name is withheld because

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
She didn't want a bit so it's like fake fake fake fake

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
And then it's like the last like she goes

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Because it's continuing her quote

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
It's not like we came here to play the game

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Says Annie something 37

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Who withheld her last name

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
But gotta catch them all

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
And it was like

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Come on so fake

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
All of these headlines or all these articles

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
About Pokemon Go are coming out as fake too

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
You know they already did like

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
All the craziest ones

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
They did like you know how they have those ads

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Testing

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
They already have a Pokemon one like

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
We're gonna catch them all about

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
STDs and I was like

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
They just made it

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
My girlfriend and I watched porn together

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
We're at Comic Con

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
We're like oh my god there must be like 70

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Pokemon ponds already

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Because there's like ones where

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
I've seen The Simpsons Ponds

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
They're like covered in makeup

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
But there's like

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
There's a guy on a hoverboard

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
And it's like

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
When hoverboards became big enough

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
That there was a cuckold video

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And you know what cuckold porn is

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Cuckold porn is like guys

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Like maybe I shouldn't limit it to gender

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
But I think it's traditionally a guy

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Who is getting fucked around on

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Either he's into it or he's not

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
He's fucked around on

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
He has to watch

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
And he can't do anything about it

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Because his dick is smaller

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
And he's on a hoverboard

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
And he comes into the porn scene

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
And he goes like

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I got a hoverboard

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
And he's got a helmet on

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
But later on

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
He'll be naked on the hoverboard

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Watching his wife fuck another guy

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
The guy that sold him the hoverboard

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
And just kind of going like

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
He's like wheeling around the room

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
You have to find this video

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
I thought we already talked about this

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Because this guy is like a master

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
You watch a man control a scene

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
From the lowest status position

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
It's bad cuckold porn because

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
He's running the fucking show

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Because he's like a robot man

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
And the other two can't stop laughing

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
And they're freaking out

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
This guy's unpredictable

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
He loves being naked on a hoverboard

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Watching me fuck his wife

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Like I am not the bigger man here

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
He's like I do love him

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
It's unmistakable that

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Every

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Figurative cock that's worth anything

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Is his to wield

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
And I am left with only

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
This absolutely vestigial

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Redundant meat tube

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Which happens to be

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Cosmetically larger diameter

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
But is absolutely powerless

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
In every way

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
This guy's a star

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
That's what technology does

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
It makes us doubt what we're born with

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Who did you meet for in Rain Man?

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Tom Cruise? He loved Dustin Hoffman

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
He's like wheeling around the room

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Going like

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
He's like I don't need just a vagina

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
He's like yeah watch it

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
He does everything anyone says

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Get over here and lick his balls

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
How do you play licking another guy's balls

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Because your wife told you to

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
How do you play that high status

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
You don't but if you play it

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
If you love licking those balls

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
And you don't give a fuck about human life

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
It just seems like he's like

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
He just seems like

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
He seems like

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
He's like little finger

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
It's a Game of Thrones reference

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
He knows exactly

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
He's like this is power

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
How is he reacting to all of this

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
He licks the balls

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
And he like stares with dead eyes

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
At his wife

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
And it's like

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
He just feels his gaze go through the back of her head

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
And she's like

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
She just finished telling him to lick another guy's balls

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
So that she could pay for his hoverboard

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
But she's just unseen

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Yeah well she's

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
He couldn't pay for the hoverboard

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
It's a tee up for a cuckold porn

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Honey I got this cuckold

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
And the guy that sold him the cuckold

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
The guy that sold him the hoverboard

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Comes in and goes like

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Yeah he loves this hoverboard

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Ryan please stay

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Did we lose you at the cuckold board

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Well I'm getting a little turned on

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
There does seem to be some movement

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Calvin Klein on this

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
There's no more vodka Ryan

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
There's no more vodka

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
There's no more vodka

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Well now you feel like a real asshole

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
That's just as well

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
That's how we time ourselves

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
There's another podcast upstairs where all the vodka is

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Real quick real quick

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
At Comic Con we were doing this game

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Because you know everyone had Game of Thrones

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Meeting people fever

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
That's been our show thanks for coming to Harmontown everybody

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
No the bit is not going to be

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
That'll get cut off

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
The bit is not going to be that cut

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
It's not the narrative of the evening

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
What I say is going to fucking kill

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Don't set yourself up like that Ryan

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
You've got fucking shit

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
You're all doing shit

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
We're all going to get in a hoverboard

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
And make you lick somebody else's balls

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Listen Dan

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
You're going to like this story

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
We've been hurt before Ryan

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Listen it's all

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Because part of the fun is that I say something

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
And then there's silence and I'm like

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Oh my god I'm in my head

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
And I'm horrible

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
We're already past our time

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Do you got to play the fucking Dungeons and Dragons bullshit?

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
No just tell the story

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
It's not a story it's an anecdote

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
I would be done by now

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
We were at Game of Thrones fever

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
So we all met Game of Thrones

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
And then everyone's going like a dancing

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Listen Ryan

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
No no no no

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
This is ridiculous

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
I'm nipping at your heels to the guest comptrollers

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Grouping wrong tell the story

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
So Dan goes

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
To Steve Levy his assistant

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
He goes

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
He goes

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
We've got another hour to go

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
We're into overtime folks

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
He's telling everybody who they are

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Who they are in Game of Thrones terms

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
You know who they are in Game of Thrones terms

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Based on their relationship to Dan and everything like that

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Because you're this person and that person goes

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Steve Levy you're Podrick you're my Podrick

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
And I don't know what you called yourself

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
What did you call yourself?

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
I like to think of myself as a

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Died in the wool Baratheon

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Which one specifically?

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
The fat one

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
So I'm hearing all this

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
You mean the shorter one?

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Very good

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Very good

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
I mean

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
I'm killing over here

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
We could have ended the show five times

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
So he goes

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
No no no no

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
So he goes he's doing everybody

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
And I hear this ago I walk up and I go

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Alright man do me

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
So who would I be in Game of Thrones

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
You'd be even little or finger

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Thank you very much it's the end of the show

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Good night everybody
