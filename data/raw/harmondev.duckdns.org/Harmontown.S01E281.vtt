{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.000\nLadies and gentlemen, coming to you from downtown Burbank, California.\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:18.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:25.000\nLet's welcome the Dungeon Master himself, Spencer, Criterion Edition.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:32.000\nHere he comes.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:44.000\nAnd now, let's welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.wn.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:45.000\nThank you.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:51.000\nHere's the mayor of Harmontown in front of us, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:57.000\nYo, yo, yo, rapping, rapping, rapping at the top of the show.\n\n00:57.000 --> 00:58.000\nFlow.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:00.000\nAll right.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:03.000\nOh, yeah, that was slick, man.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:04.000\nHoly shit.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:12.000\nI think that was my most pared down, but therefore admirable freestyling in the history of the show.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:16.000\nWell, Schrab's controlling this episode.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:18.000\nYou're welcome, Sauron.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.000\nHe looks like no face.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:23.000\nHe's already doing physical bits.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:28.000\nHey, I was the one that wanted to do the podcast on video.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:29.000\nThis is you.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:30.000\nYeah, this is you.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:31.000\nWhat do you remind me of?\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nThat's a Sesame Street Muppet, right?\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nThose youp, youp, youp, youp, youp, youp, youp guys.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:38.000\nYeah, I remind you of that.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:40.000\nIn that jacket with the hood over.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:41.000\nOkay.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:43.000\nIn the audio world, what's going on?\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:44.000\nNothing.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nI'm on deadline.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:49.000\nI have to finish the script tonight.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\nSo I'm going to try to...\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:53.000\nSo we're going to talk double fast to get the show done.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:57.000\nWait, but don't distract from what's going on in the audio world.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.000\nOh.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:03.000\nWell, that's what I was just switching over to not talking about what Schrab looked like.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:04.000\nOh, right.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:07.000\nNo, let's talk about what Schrab looks like.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:10.000\nWell, that would be going back into the video world.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:11.000\nOh, shit.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nYeah, let's not do that.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:17.000\nLet's not go back into the video world.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:18.000\nWell, it's going to be a great show.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:19.000\nNo.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:20.000\nYeah.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:24.000\nNever in the history of the opening of the show have there ever been more milestones\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:27.000\nof that in the span of two minutes.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:30.000\nThis is the part where I talk about whatever's going on.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.000\nLike I said, I got to finish the script.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nExcuse me.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:37.000\nThat was Schrab.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:40.000\nOh, was it?\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:46.000\nI covered my mouth, but I didn't think you would hear that.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:53.000\nYeah, so I'm probably going to, I'll probably have one drink at some point in the show,\n\n02:53.000 --> 03:00.000\nmaybe even three, because I'll start to get nervous that the show is going poorly because\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:04.000\nI'm bad at doing a show, but I really got to keep my shit together.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:05.000\nYeah.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:12.000\nI got to fucking, my therapist told me I am sitting on this script because it is my last\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\nchance to be miserable.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:19.000\nI am this close to happy.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nThat's interesting.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:22.000\nThat's interesting.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:23.000\nI'm going through the same thing myself.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:24.000\nI'm having a...\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nWhat are you using to make yourself miserable?\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\nDoing nothing.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:32.000\nJust postponing stuff, procrastinating.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:40.000\nWell, Cody right now is at home just, you know, she probably doesn't mind me telling\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:49.000\nthis because she just finished, she's on hiatus at her regular job and then her other project\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:54.000\nthat she put a lot, you know, she's spent a year of a relationship with this series of\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:58.000\nscripts and that lifetime has come to an end.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:02.000\nSo she's having that like writer postpartum kind of depression.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nAnd it's just funny because we're all miserable.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:08.000\nYou're miserable because you don't have a job to do.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:10.000\nCody's miserable because her job is over.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\nI'm miserable because I won't stop working.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:20.000\nAnd I think it's like the grass is greener, never applied more.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nLike we are afraid to deal.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nLook, I'm just going to go there because my therapist goes there.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nWe're afraid to deal with God.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:30.000\nLike I...\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:36.000\nAnd if you're an atheist, I applaud you because that just means you're a scientist and a skeptic\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nand we need those more than ever.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:42.000\nSo when I say God, you just think universe, think chaos.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:48.000\nBut I don't want to pussy foot around about it because I believe in a God that like made my sister retarded\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nand will just give you leukemia because he's bored.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:58.000\nSo I'm like scared of God and like, I don't want to move on to that part of my life where I have to have a relationship\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:05.000\nwith this thing I picture as a big Dan Harmon head in the sky that's like psycho and just does crazy shit.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nJust to remind you that he's around.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:15.000\nI feel like a relationship with God is like owing Polly and good fellas money.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:20.000\nIt's like he's doing you favors and now you're like, what do I have to do and you don't know.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nAnd I've wanted forever to control that.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nI've wanted to do it.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:34.000\nThat's what a writer does or a workaholic does is they say, well, I'm in charge of my bad luck and my good luck.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:40.000\nI'm in charge of whether or not I'm having a bad day.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:48.000\nBut it's crazy to do that because I've been doing it for 45 years and what if tomorrow I find a lump or whatever.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nIt's like I'm going to be double the sucker.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:55.000\nI just got to stop pretending like it's hard to write.\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:00.000\nIt's just been the biggest scam that I've ever perpetrated on myself and humanity.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:05.000\nWhat I do is not difficult and I think I'm ashamed of that.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:11.000\nI try to make it like it's like art or something and it's like so tired.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:16.000\nDo you think you're doing that because if it wasn't difficult, it wouldn't be work?\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:17.000\nYeah.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:24.000\nI think the voice of my brother who I've tried not to mention on this podcast because we don't speak to each other because I mentioned him on the podcast.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:32.000\nI've tried to like I'm not going to talk about my brother, but another way of looking at it is I can do nothing but talk shit about my brother now forever.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:37.000\nBut my brother is five years older than me and growing up.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:49.000\nIt's just like this chorus of like he was the guy who was like, yeah, you got mom convinced, but you're a fucking idiot.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:56.000\nLike my brother knew I was smart, but like you're not special. You're not like like you just you're just a lazy piece of shit.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.000\nYou know, and like you're spoiled and you're entitled and mom buys it.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:08.000\nAnd just because just because I am five years older than you and I smoke weed first and I set fire to the mailbox first and then the driveway first.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:16.000\nAnd then I poured motor oil in the neighbor's swimming pool first and dropped out of high school first and and hit the house with a baseball bat first.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nJust because I'm doing all those things first doesn't mean you're not going to do them.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nAnd even if you don't do them, it'll only because you had me as an example.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:25.000\nAnd the truth is you're just a charlatan, you know, you're just like this.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nYou just you're the you're the baby.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:32.000\nYou like you got you got it all. You got you got you got everything like lined lined up for you.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:42.000\nAnd and that and that that voice is an important voice because it keeps you especially in these days of like monitoring checking privilege and whatever.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:51.000\nIt's like I got I got like this great fucking antenna for that because I'm just always going you little piece of shit in my head over and over again.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:54.000\nLike you're not you're not stuff trying to act like you're fucking talented.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nYou're not talented and all this stuff.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:08.000\nAnd so the idea of me being like like just good or lucky, like, you know, it has to do with my sister too.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:12.000\nIt's like it's just it just fucks with me.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:19.000\nBut it's it's it's been selfish to to like think of it that way.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nIt's been it's it's it doesn't make any sense.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:25.000\nIt's not productive at all. Sorry I have my back to you Spencer.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nNo, I like suspicion that you're God.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nSo I wanted to leave you out of this for a little bit.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nRight.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:35.000\nIf you are God, prove it.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:42.000\nIf I was God, wouldn't it like betray my purposes to prove it at this point?\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nHe just proved that I don't think so.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:54.000\nI at my therapist said, could you be crazier?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:58.000\nThat's what she wants.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:08.000\nNo, she said she said, could you live with the fact that you weren't like the special one?\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:18.000\nYou know, like, I mean, like, you know, like, because you you feel like because I've I've had problems where just like, well, you know, you get you get the spotlight.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:23.000\nAnd and then all of a sudden your brain goes blank and you can't figure it out or whatever.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:28.000\nAnd just like, well, well, maybe don't be tempted by the spotlight.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:31.000\nYou know, you don't have to be the best.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.000\nYeah.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:41.000\nAnd especially with writing, you know, like writing is and any art is like when you go like, oh, I'm going to make the best thing I've ever done before.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nThat's usually failure.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.000\nBut if you go, I'm going to make a piece of shit that's just going to be fun to do.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nThat's when you do your best work.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nYeah.\n\n09:49.000 --> 10:03.000\nAnd another thing my therapist pointed out is like, you know what, you know what, aside from being like cheating, you know, if you were to just do what's easy and fun for you and let yourself be good at it and fast at it.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:07.000\nAnd it's like you you you work like barely at all.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nAside from not being fair.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:21.000\nAnother thing that that would be is effeminate because it's like I have this masculine relationship, this faux Hemingway relationship with the idea of writing.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:35.000\nLike, oh, you've got to dig and make and decide and create and alter and and and ultimately it's it's taking something that should not be dichotomous.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:45.000\nIt should be success and failure or kill or be killed or good or bad writing and and and it and turning it into that.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:50.000\nThat's what you do when you're like competitive and petty and self loathing and about your work.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nLike, oh, I want to this is a shot.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nI'm writing shitty today.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:55.000\nNow I'm writing good.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nThis has to be the best.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:01.000\nAnd then you wonder why you take six months to write something that could take you three hours.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:06.000\nLike, you've decided to like get into a ring and like make everything about like combat.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nAnd do you write every day?\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:09.000\nDo you like?\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:10.000\nNo, no.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nDo you dip?\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:17.000\nBut when you when you decide I'm going to write today, do you write like a couple of hours?\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nDo you write?\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nHow long?\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nI mean, do you sit down and go, I'm going to do a marathon?\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:22.000\nOr do you do like?\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nI have a 10 minutes at a time.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:32.000\nI'm interested here because the because I'll answer that question, the show after I turn in the script that I've been working on for way too long.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:33.000\nRight.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nBecause I want to answer that question honestly.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:51.000\nAnd if I answer it honestly right now, the people that that that are that I've been torturing by sitting on this script like might just find me and shoot me because I know that that answer is that that's part of the thing that we dread is like, well, what page are you on?\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:55.000\nWhat what what how long did you know, like what's the it's like?\n\n11:55.000 --> 12:04.000\nYeah, if I if I was working six hours a day, this entire time on this and focusing on it, of course, it would have been done by now.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:10.000\nI get I try to write every day.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:21.000\nBut what I end up doing is I go to my spot, I open up my laptop, and I stare at the computer for six to eight hours.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.000\nThen I close it up and then go.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nI can't work.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nI'll start on it tomorrow.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:32.000\nSo I'll do I and I'll be doing that for months and months and months.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nYeah.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:38.000\nI mean, believe me, I I'll maybe write like three sentences.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:46.000\nI'll I mean, it used to be so much easier because I would write I would write because I would go, oh, I'm a shitty writer.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nI'm just going to write a piece of shit.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:51.000\nAnd it was so much easier back then.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nIt is a good enough segue.\n\n12:53.000 --> 13:01.000\nI mean, we could because we can talk with our guest about all the other crap, which is just like everyone else just going like, holy shit, the world is exploding.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:10.000\nAnd we can talk about that with our guest, but what a good segue because we have a woman writer, not a female writer.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nThat's a that's a callback to one of her pieces.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:25.000\nShe's got if you go if you go to our website, Carol brown.com, you can see there's like a there's like a list of the shit she's written for Jezebel and and other sites.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:31.000\nAnd she has blog entries and stuff and she's like it's it's it's all really great stuff.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nI'm looking forward to just making friends with her chatting with her.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:43.000\nPlease welcome Carol Brown.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nHello.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nI'm not good at greeting people.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nI don't know if he's terrible at it.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nHello.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nWould you like some vodka?\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nOh, man, you know, I'm getting over a cold.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nSo vodka helps that right.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nYeah.\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nYeah.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nAnd then it'll yeah.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nSo dig in.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nYou dig into the ice with your with your.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nThat's a lot of ice.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:07.000\nYeah.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:10.000\nHe uses all of that by the end of the show.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nYeah.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nDo you want me to pour it for you?\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nYou know, like a gentleman.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:21.000\nI'm a guest, you know, or am I going to read an article on Jezebel next week of why men need to stop pouring.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:27.000\nYou know, if I was still a Jezebel, it might be a concern.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nWe'll see.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:30.000\nThat's good.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:31.000\nThat was that.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.000\nThank you.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nThank you.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nYou've also retired your shade court.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nOh my gosh, you know about shade court.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nWell, because I went to your website.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nSo I was like, like looking through all your stuff.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:44.000\nI thought your voice was amazingly crisp and.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nOh, like.\n\n14:46.000 --> 15:00.000\nI was like, like, I, you, you literally have an entry that talks about this like angry black woman, like stereotype and how people can't like, and so it's, it's.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:14.000\nIt's hard to like you're a white guy and you're like, you read stuff and you go like, I want, I want to let this person know that they're intimidating because that would be a good compliment, but maybe not to.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:18.000\nNo, I know, I know what you mean because I've gotten intimidating.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:24.000\nI think outside of the fact that I'm a black woman, like I know that I'm kind of like an intimidating person.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:27.000\nSo I think you can, I think you can divorce the two.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nI am intimidating so you can say it.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nI won't, I won't write about it tomorrow.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nYou say it.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nYou have a, you also have a pasta fetish.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nYou have a pasta.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nI live at your website.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nI was like, I think we'll probably get along.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nI think this will be fine.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:44.000\nI make, I make fresh pasta.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nFancy pasta bitch.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nYeah.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nI, I do do that.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:55.000\nIt was sort of a response, I think to like I started early last year and I was like, this feels like it's going to be a long ass four years.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:56.000\nHopefully.\n\n15:56.000 --> 16:03.000\nAnd I, I needed like some sort of, I like it because it's a busy body type of hobby.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:10.000\nLike you, you're doing something with your hands, but it doesn't necessarily require a lot of like brain power and you can watch TV or do something like that.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nAnd then at the end you get to eat pasta.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.000\nSo.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.000\nBut you hate arugula and continues to make us.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nHe's literally missing everything on my website.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:22.000\nI was so glad to see somebody just shit on arugula.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:23.000\nIt's disgusting.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:28.000\nI'm so tired of people acting like it's like delicious.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\nIt's everywhere too.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:30.000\nYeah.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.000\nThey put it on everything.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:32.000\nYeah.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nThey won't, they won't, they won't put it in the menu description.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:37.000\nBy the way, we're going to put what you call scraggly ass and what it was about.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:38.000\nArugula.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nI don't even remember that one.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nIt's scraggly lettuce.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:42.000\nYeah.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nOn top of your shit that's going to like.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nIn the mixed salad.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nIt tastes like you got lost.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:47.000\nYeah.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:51.000\nYou know, when they give you like a side salad and they don't tell you arugula is in the side salad.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:52.000\nI hate that.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.000\nYeah.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:57.000\nUm, but the headline item is that you're a TV writer.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:00.000\nYou, you, you, did you, were you on blackish?\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\nNo, no, I actually went from Jezebel to Gronish.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nOkay.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:07.000\nUm, it was, it was, yeah, made, made that leap.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:10.000\nUm, Gronish is the spin-off of blackish.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:11.000\nYes.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:17.000\nI, I honestly have not only seen clips of blackish even though I did a panel with the creator\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:23.000\nand we, he's, he's much more respectful to my work than obviously I am of his or toward\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nhis, not of his cause I haven't seen it.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.000\nUm, but the, so I don't know.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:29.000\nCan you describe?\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:30.000\nYeah.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:31.000\nYeah.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nSo, um, blackish is about a black family.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nUm, gross.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nI know, right?\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:42.000\nUh, Cosby show, Esk, just in that it's like, um, you know, a well to do black family right\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:45.000\nnow, um, navigating all of that.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:50.000\nUm, and in the show, the oldest daughter, uh, uh, her name's Zoe Johnson played by Yara\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nShahidi.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:54.000\nAnd so our show is Yara going off to college.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:57.000\nUm, conveniently a different world Esk.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:04.000\nUm, and her, her dealing with all of that and being in college right now and, and all\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nthat bullshit.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nWere you a different world fan?\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:13.000\nI was, I was a little young to watch it while it was on, but later I, I would watch a different\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:14.000\nworld.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.000\nYeah.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:18.000\nAnd so you're way too young to, did you watch Cosby and like syndication or?\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nYeah, I think.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:20.000\nYeah.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.000\nYeah.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nWhat was it?\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nWhat's your take as a modern millennial?\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nI'm assuming millennial.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nI don't know.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nOkay.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:31.000\nLike what's your take on the, on the, on the huckstables as, as a black family on television?\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nI mean, I love the Cosby show.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nI think like everyone.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nI actually still do.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:41.000\nI wrote about, I wrote a piece about this recently where like in sort of the wake of all of this\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nstuff that's happening and coming up.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:48.000\nLike for me, I may not fuck with Bill Cosby anymore, but it seems really disingenuous\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:52.000\nto act like I didn't love the Cosby show because it was wonderful.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:57.000\nAnd I get that for a lot of people it's tainted now, like understandably and it could be difficult\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nto watch.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:02.500\nBut, um, you know, I'm not going to pretend like it wasn't amazing and like groundbreaking\n\n19:02.500 --> 19:07.000\nand that, um, I didn't love seeing a family like that on television.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:11.120\nIt sort of seems like, I mean, especially at its, at its high point when there were\n\n19:11.120 --> 19:16.000\nstill only three or four networks, there's a different game being played that we, that\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:20.880\nwe learned from now, which is that the, I'm always pointing out the Norman Lear philosophy,\n\n19:20.880 --> 19:28.000\nwhich is that we're not, our goal is not to like, well, I don't know.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.520\nAll I know is that what, what, what Norman Lear was, was, was, was like looking at himself\n\n19:31.520 --> 19:39.120\nand going like, look, I don't, I don't look like the family that I'm about to create a\n\n19:39.120 --> 19:43.880\nshow for, but if I don't, um, nobody will.\n\n19:43.880 --> 19:47.440\nAnd then the syndrome will continue where people are watching television and seeing\n\n19:47.440 --> 19:50.600\nnobody that looks like them, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n19:50.600 --> 19:57.240\nAnd, um, and so like it's, it just seems like TV, like we, we, we made a decision to worship\n\n19:57.240 --> 19:58.240\nit.\n\n19:58.240 --> 20:02.280\nWe made a decision, a decision that, that it wasn't even going to be about quality.\n\n20:02.280 --> 20:03.280\nIt's not art.\n\n20:03.280 --> 20:09.440\nIt was like, uh, it's like a barn raising or a church, you know, like we, and so it,\n\n20:09.440 --> 20:17.840\nit, that I watched the Cosby show every night and like I was, it was like, you know, you\n\n20:17.840 --> 20:22.160\nwould read in TV guide this and that about the idea of it having something to do with\n\n20:22.160 --> 20:25.920\nblackness, but the more important thing was that it was the Cosby show and it was, it\n\n20:25.920 --> 20:29.160\nwas the Huckstables and it was like always going to be amazing and funny.\n\n20:29.160 --> 20:33.360\nAnd part of that was like listening to this like audience that may or may not have existed\n\n20:33.360 --> 20:39.160\nin the live studio, losing their fucking shit because this episode is about, you know, might\n\n20:39.160 --> 20:44.000\ncome down to Bill Cosby, like making a face for his daughter to help her get over a cold\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nor something.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:49.160\nAnd it just doesn't, everyone's just pissing themselves and we just, we just took part\n\n20:49.160 --> 20:50.160\nin it.\n\n20:50.160 --> 20:52.080\nI don't know what my God damn point is.\n\n20:52.080 --> 20:57.920\nI'm having my very first, like I'm a bad interviewer vodka, so it's not going to make me a good\n\n20:57.920 --> 21:06.640\ninterviewer, but like, so what, so your perspective on this though is like, it's a little different,\n\n21:06.640 --> 21:11.280\nlike, because I'm, I'm possibly 20 or more years older than you have no idea.\n\n21:11.280 --> 21:20.360\nI'm not going to ask, um, but like, what do you, what do you make of these shifting definitions?\n\n21:20.360 --> 21:29.600\nLike as far as, as far as white people are concerned, like your advice to them, like\n\n21:29.600 --> 21:33.800\nin terms of like, are you supposed to, let's just start with the basic, are you supposed\n\n21:33.800 --> 21:41.440\nto recognize race or, or this fantasy of being colorblind, like, like, let's get that out\n\n21:41.440 --> 21:42.440\nof there.\n\n21:42.440 --> 21:43.440\nDon't say colorblind.\n\n21:43.440 --> 21:44.440\nYeah, that's bad.\n\n21:44.440 --> 21:49.920\nLike we tried that for like this tremendous amount of time and it just didn't, it's not\n\n21:49.920 --> 21:50.920\nreal.\n\n21:50.920 --> 21:55.440\nI don't want, I don't know that, and it, colorblindness is, is sort of saying like, just pretend\n\n21:55.440 --> 21:56.680\neveryone's white.\n\n21:56.680 --> 22:01.760\nThat's like kind of what people mean when they say colorblind and like, I don't want, like\n\n22:01.760 --> 22:06.880\nI like being black, so I don't need anyone to act like I'm not, and I'm sure that other\n\n22:06.880 --> 22:09.600\npeople of color like being whatever they are.\n\n22:09.600 --> 22:13.880\nAnd so, and I'm sure white people love being white because it seems incredible.\n\n22:13.880 --> 22:17.920\nSo, um, I went into a library the other day and they said, you don't have to bring the\n\n22:17.920 --> 22:18.920\nbooks back.\n\n22:18.920 --> 22:19.920\nReally?\n\n22:19.920 --> 22:20.920\nYeah.\n\n22:20.920 --> 22:21.920\nI was just like, what?\n\n22:21.920 --> 22:22.920\nThey're like, they did this like gesture.\n\n22:22.920 --> 22:27.760\nI was like, oh, and then there was a black guy behind me and they were like, this is\n\n22:27.760 --> 22:28.760\noverdue.\n\n22:28.760 --> 22:31.800\nAnd he was like, well, I know that's how the libraries work and the person, the librarian\n\n22:31.800 --> 22:32.800\nwas like, shh.\n\n22:32.800 --> 22:34.640\nI didn't know that's what they meant by shh.\n\n22:34.640 --> 22:35.640\nAll right.\n\n22:35.640 --> 22:36.640\nAnd it was, sorry.\n\n22:36.640 --> 22:40.280\nThe, the, um, what is going on?\n\n22:40.280 --> 22:43.600\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I followed all of that.\n\n22:43.600 --> 22:44.600\nYeah.\n\n22:44.600 --> 22:45.600\nThe, the, the, the, but, okay.\n\n22:45.600 --> 22:50.040\nSo this is your, this is your first step into TV, right?\n\n22:50.040 --> 22:51.960\nFrom prose, from essay.\n\n22:51.960 --> 22:52.960\nYes.\n\n22:52.960 --> 22:54.520\nUm, how did you get the job?\n\n22:54.520 --> 22:55.760\nUm, I got the job.\n\n22:55.760 --> 22:58.600\nSo I had been, so I'd been at Jezebel.\n\n22:58.600 --> 23:01.920\nI actually, like when I moved to LA, I moved, I was living in New York.\n\n23:01.920 --> 23:04.960\nI moved to LA with the intention of getting into TV writing.\n\n23:04.960 --> 23:08.320\nUm, and I had a really strong start at Jezebel.\n\n23:08.320 --> 23:09.640\nSo I kind of got distracted.\n\n23:09.640 --> 23:11.760\nI was like, Tana Hasey Coates knows my name.\n\n23:11.760 --> 23:14.520\nWho the fuck cares about TV?\n\n23:14.520 --> 23:19.760\nAnd then Gawker filed for bankruptcy and I panicked.\n\n23:19.760 --> 23:24.040\nAnd also I think it clarified that ultimately what I was trying to do.\n\n23:24.040 --> 23:29.040\nAnd so I had been working on a sample that I ended up finishing in like two weeks out\n\n23:29.040 --> 23:33.200\nof just like sheer desperation, um, and a friend, he helped me edit it.\n\n23:33.200 --> 23:36.920\nAnd then he actually, he was wrapped, he's wrapped at CAA.\n\n23:36.920 --> 23:41.120\nThey were having this comedy writers boot camp kind of seminar thing and it was aimed\n\n23:41.120 --> 23:46.480\ntowards women and people of color, um, and so they're like panels and networking, whatever.\n\n23:46.480 --> 23:48.680\nAnd so Issa Rae was one of the speakers.\n\n23:48.680 --> 23:52.280\nAnd so I knew that she, she followed me on Twitter and I was like, I know, I think she\n\n23:52.280 --> 23:54.440\nknows who I am and has read my writing.\n\n23:54.440 --> 23:57.840\nAnd so I went up to her and she immediately was like, Oh my God, hello, look, I didn't\n\n23:57.840 --> 23:59.640\nknow you were interested in TV.\n\n23:59.640 --> 24:02.280\nAnd so she had her deal, she has her deal with HBO.\n\n24:02.280 --> 24:07.640\nAnd so she was looking for a material and I was like, I literally have this one script.\n\n24:07.640 --> 24:11.480\nAnd I sent it to her team and they're like, cool, and they liked it and they sent it\n\n24:11.480 --> 24:12.480\nto HBO.\n\n24:12.480 --> 24:16.840\nAnd then all of a sudden I had a meeting with an Amy at HBO, which meant nothing to me.\n\n24:16.840 --> 24:22.520\nI was like, I don't know guys, I'm going to, she's the head of comedy at HBO, had no idea.\n\n24:22.520 --> 24:26.520\nAnd people, um, a bunch of people who like didn't really give a shit before started to\n\n24:26.520 --> 24:27.520\ngive a shit.\n\n24:27.520 --> 24:30.560\nSo like that's how I got my agents, because like I had sort of been sending things to\n\n24:30.560 --> 24:35.240\nfriends and agencies and obviously nobody cared until you had something going on.\n\n24:35.240 --> 24:43.960\nAnd then I just spent the beginning of 2017, like doing all those generals and that slog.\n\n24:43.960 --> 24:49.320\nAnd then I had been going into ABC a lot and they kept being like, we think Kenya, Kenya\n\n24:49.320 --> 24:53.160\nBears who created Blackish and created Gronich, they're like, we think Kenya will like you,\n\n24:53.160 --> 24:54.480\nwe think Kenya will like you.\n\n24:54.480 --> 24:58.280\nAnd I kind of had to wait until the show had been picked up.\n\n24:58.280 --> 25:01.120\nHe didn't like want to meet anyone until everything was ready.\n\n25:01.120 --> 25:06.400\nAnd then I drove to Encino and we had, we had coffee and, and then I got the job.\n\n25:06.400 --> 25:07.400\nThis is exciting.\n\n25:07.400 --> 25:08.400\nYeah.\n\n25:08.400 --> 25:14.000\nAre you, are you, so you're just, you're a staff writer entering and like, are, what\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:17.160\nare, what are, well, and you can say, I don't want to talk about this because I don't want\n\n25:17.160 --> 25:21.440\nto start my, my TV career, uh, even risking doing the right thing, but I was just like\n\n25:21.440 --> 25:24.920\ncurious, like what are your, what are your nightmare scenarios in your head when you\n\n25:24.920 --> 25:26.400\nthink about the first day of school?\n\n25:26.400 --> 25:30.780\nLike I, the thing is I had been working from home for three years.\n\n25:30.780 --> 25:36.120\nSo the idea of just interacting with humans all day was like, I, it was all I need.\n\n25:36.120 --> 25:40.360\nLike I was so desperate for human contact that it would have had to have been such an\n\n25:40.360 --> 25:45.640\nunbelievable nightmare for me to have like been unhappy with the setup.\n\n25:45.640 --> 25:47.120\nSo, um, I don't know.\n\n25:47.120 --> 25:50.960\nI just didn't really like, one of the things that I think has helped me is there's a lot\n\n25:50.960 --> 25:54.040\nof stuff that I didn't really know, like in the same way that I didn't really know who\n\n25:54.040 --> 25:55.640\nAmy was.\n\n25:55.640 --> 25:58.880\nI was like, I don't know guys, like this will be fine.\n\n25:58.880 --> 26:02.840\nAnd, um, because I didn't really know what to be afraid of.\n\n26:02.840 --> 26:05.920\nI wasn't that afraid of things.\n\n26:05.920 --> 26:11.300\nMost of the value in a staff writer, I mean, like, like you're, the town runs on fresh\n\n26:11.300 --> 26:13.000\nblood from the Midwest.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:14.160\nBy the way, where did you grow up?\n\n26:14.160 --> 26:17.160\nI grew up in Seattle, Seattle, Washington.\n\n26:17.160 --> 26:18.160\nYeah.\n\n26:18.160 --> 26:21.360\nThat, that naivete, Schrab and I are never going to get that back where we did our best\n\n26:21.360 --> 26:24.040\nwriting when we were probably how old you are.\n\n26:24.040 --> 26:25.040\nI'm not going to ask.\n\n26:25.040 --> 26:29.080\nUm, but we were like, we, we wrote this pilot called heat vision and jagged it might as\n\n26:29.080 --> 26:30.080\nwell have been called.\n\n26:30.080 --> 26:31.280\nWe don't know how TV works.\n\n26:31.280 --> 26:36.600\nLike, like we just, we just grew up watching it and we just like love the idea of a talking\n\n26:36.600 --> 26:37.600\nmotorcycle kind of thing.\n\n26:37.600 --> 26:41.880\nIt was like, like that naivete is, which is a bad word for it.\n\n26:41.880 --> 26:44.400\nIt's, it's, it's, it's not naivete.\n\n26:44.400 --> 26:47.880\nIt's, it's, I mean, there was so much stuff I didn't, like when the scripts kept coming\n\n26:47.880 --> 26:52.840\nback in different colors and I was like, I was like, I didn't want to ask anyone.\n\n26:52.840 --> 26:57.000\nLike, obviously I was going to ask, like, you know, someone in charge.\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:00.320\nAnd so I might have asked one of the writers assistants, or I think I maybe just figured\n\n27:00.320 --> 27:01.320\nit out.\n\n27:01.320 --> 27:02.320\nI was like, Oh, it's a different draft.\n\n27:02.320 --> 27:05.280\nIt's a different draft when the scripts are in different color.\n\n27:05.280 --> 27:07.480\nAnd I was like, Oh, it's purple today.\n\n27:07.480 --> 27:09.360\nDoes that mean I did bad?\n\n27:09.360 --> 27:10.360\nYeah.\n\n27:10.360 --> 27:11.920\nLike didn't really figure it out.\n\n27:11.920 --> 27:12.920\nUm, yeah.\n\n27:12.920 --> 27:13.920\nI never knew.\n\n27:13.920 --> 27:18.720\nI guess I kind of still don't know when, because people will like make jokes about,\n\n27:18.720 --> 27:19.720\nyou know, in community.\n\n27:19.720 --> 27:25.520\nIt's like, okay, we're on, we're on tier three of like, we've been in salmon.\n\n27:25.520 --> 27:28.200\nWe've been in triple, triple, triple blues.\n\n27:28.200 --> 27:33.200\nWe've definitely flipped the, flipped the rainbow a couple times with our rewrites.\n\n27:33.200 --> 27:34.200\nLike,\n\n27:34.200 --> 27:36.080\nWhat do you do when you go back to blue?\n\n27:36.080 --> 27:41.480\nYou just hope by that time, it's mathematically impossible that there's a still blue pages\n\n27:41.480 --> 27:45.320\nleft from the first time you had a meltdown.\n\n27:45.320 --> 27:50.440\nIf you've done that many rewrites, how can it be possible that there's still first blue?\n\n27:50.440 --> 27:55.080\nI think you, I think there is some kind of like, I, I, this is, this is why writers\n\n27:55.080 --> 28:00.640\nwhen that situation is happening, you, you're less concerned exactly which blue pages you're\n\n28:00.640 --> 28:04.000\nlooking at because it's like we're fucking 12 days behind.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:05.000\nYeah.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:10.200\nWell, I also, I also, like it, it makes me wonder, yeah, I always, I would never could\n\n28:10.200 --> 28:16.040\ntell because who's going to come up to me and say, um, you know, there's way too many\n\n28:16.040 --> 28:19.040\ncolors in the binder, you know, it's fucking ridiculous.\n\n28:19.040 --> 28:20.840\nI would always say this is getting crazy.\n\n28:20.840 --> 28:22.480\nCan we, can we repaginate?\n\n28:22.480 --> 28:27.600\nLike this is like, because they do this thing where the pages break because they don't want\n\n28:27.600 --> 28:29.040\nthe other page numbers to change.\n\n28:29.040 --> 28:33.680\nSo then you end up on community and feel like, you know, just turn the page and then Troy\n\n28:33.680 --> 28:40.520\nsays, uh, Troy and Abed in the, and then you've turned the page because I changed it to morning.\n\n28:40.520 --> 28:48.480\nUm, anyways, the, uh, that's, that's, that's a reason why I, as much as I, I understand\n\n28:48.480 --> 28:53.640\nthat people who like tweet me or through other channels like inquire about the concept of\n\n28:53.640 --> 28:58.520\na writer's assistant, I know that the image in their head is like of a squire with like\n\n28:58.520 --> 29:04.560\na quill, you know, that he hands to Shakespeare when Shakespeare gets in a duel with, with\n\n29:04.560 --> 29:06.440\nanother writer.\n\n29:06.440 --> 29:07.440\nAnd that happens.\n\n29:07.440 --> 29:08.440\nIt does happen.\n\n29:08.440 --> 29:09.440\nIt's just not the main part of the job.\n\n29:09.440 --> 29:10.440\nYeah.\n\n29:10.440 --> 29:11.440\nIt's not, it's not.\n\n29:11.440 --> 29:12.440\nI think God, I never had to be here.\n\n29:12.440 --> 29:17.640\nI would have been, if I had had to come up and sort of like the traditional, like a P.A.\n\n29:17.640 --> 29:18.640\nand then a writer's P.A.\n\n29:18.640 --> 29:21.840\nAnd I would have, I wouldn't, I would have found a different career.\n\n29:21.840 --> 29:22.840\nI'm not organized.\n\n29:22.840 --> 29:28.400\nLike I find that job insane and they're so like, I would have, I wouldn't have made\n\n29:28.400 --> 29:29.400\nit through a season of television.\n\n29:29.400 --> 29:30.400\nThat's right.\n\n29:30.400 --> 29:31.400\nYeah, for sure.\n\n29:31.400 --> 29:36.520\nI, I, it's, it's, it's legitimately, I guess, I guess I'm saying this like it's a mindblower\n\n29:36.520 --> 29:41.400\nbecause what isn't it, but it's harder work than the, the, the writing on the show.\n\n29:41.400 --> 29:42.960\nWe just sit around and talk.\n\n29:42.960 --> 29:43.960\nYeah.\n\n29:43.960 --> 29:47.160\nAnd the fact that the writer's assistant is there means that what is, well, already\n\n29:47.160 --> 29:52.120\nan easier, easy job, which is going, what if a guy had a horse?\n\n29:52.120 --> 29:56.880\nWe now just like sit there and like vape and go, what if a guy had a horse and like it's\n\n29:56.880 --> 30:04.400\nup to Tim to remember that we said it and a lot of those people are good writers.\n\n30:04.400 --> 30:09.760\nIt's not like, oh, those people are science brains, like they're clerical thinkers.\n\n30:09.760 --> 30:13.800\nLike they're, no, they're, they're, they're decent writers who go on to good writing careers\n\n30:13.800 --> 30:17.960\nand, and, and then you look back and go, oh man, that poor fucking guy.\n\n30:17.960 --> 30:18.960\nI, yeah.\n\n30:18.960 --> 30:19.960\nOh, anyways.\n\n30:19.960 --> 30:20.960\nCouldn't have been me.\n\n30:20.960 --> 30:27.600\nWell, let's talk about like fraud complex, have you, have you, is it, is it, is it different\n\n30:27.600 --> 30:28.600\nfor you?\n\n30:28.600 --> 30:29.600\nLike at all?\n\n30:29.600 --> 30:35.080\nLike you, you, you're, you, you, when you leap from the pages of, of, of the internets\n\n30:35.080 --> 30:40.680\ninto, into a writer's room like that, do you ever, like, are you, are you plagued with\n\n30:40.680 --> 30:43.720\nanxiety about, I don't deserve this or anything like that?\n\n30:43.720 --> 30:48.880\nI mean, I think one of the things for me is that I had been writing professionally for\n\n30:48.880 --> 30:51.640\nthree years, like people were giving me money to write.\n\n30:51.640 --> 30:54.480\nAnd also because it's the internet, I was getting a lot of feedback.\n\n30:54.480 --> 30:59.360\nSo I was like, I know, like when I first wrote that, that script, I was like, I know I'm\n\n30:59.360 --> 31:03.280\nnot a shitty writer because like it would have, someone would have figured it out over\n\n31:03.280 --> 31:04.280\nthe course of three years.\n\n31:04.280 --> 31:08.640\nI don't know if I'm good at writing comedy scripts, but it's probably not going to be\n\n31:08.640 --> 31:12.480\nsuper shitty because I'm not a super shitty writer.\n\n31:12.480 --> 31:14.680\nSo it helped me in that regard.\n\n31:14.680 --> 31:20.920\nI mean, I feel like even now, like I just wrote, I wrote a cover story for the fader\n\n31:20.920 --> 31:25.560\non the singer SZA and it was the first feature like profile I'd ever written.\n\n31:25.560 --> 31:29.280\nAnd so I, when I finished the story, I was like, I think this is fine.\n\n31:29.280 --> 31:31.680\nI was like, this is a fine story.\n\n31:31.680 --> 31:36.600\nAnd the response has been much, people think it's much better than fine.\n\n31:36.600 --> 31:38.460\nBut that's usually how I am with my writing.\n\n31:38.460 --> 31:41.320\nSo I, you know, even like when I was at Jezebel and I would write something, I was like,\n\n31:41.320 --> 31:42.520\nthis isn't that funny.\n\n31:42.520 --> 31:44.840\nAnd then the commenters like are finding it really funny.\n\n31:44.840 --> 31:49.240\nSo I know that my standard is different.\n\n31:49.240 --> 31:53.960\nSo I think it, and I kind of knew that so I was like, even if I think this is fine,\n\n31:53.960 --> 31:56.160\nI think other people think it's better than that.\n\n31:56.160 --> 32:00.280\nSo I wasn't as nervous about that.\n\n32:00.280 --> 32:01.280\nBut I don't know.\n\n32:01.280 --> 32:05.440\nIt's like, also it's funny, like my dad says this, I lived in Dallas, Texas until I was\n\n32:05.440 --> 32:06.440\nseven.\n\n32:06.440 --> 32:11.800\nAnd so my dad talked about when he was raising me and my sister, my mom was there too, but\n\n32:11.800 --> 32:13.320\nhe tells the story.\n\n32:13.320 --> 32:17.160\nAnd he's like, I really raised, tried to make sure that you had a lot of self-esteem because\n\n32:17.160 --> 32:22.120\nI didn't want to raise like a little black girl in the South to not have a lot of self-esteem\n\n32:22.120 --> 32:24.640\nbecause there were probably a lot of things that would crush that.\n\n32:24.640 --> 32:27.840\nAnd so, and then his punchline is that like he went too far.\n\n32:27.840 --> 32:33.320\nThat's never been a real big problem for me.\n\n32:33.320 --> 32:34.320\nYeah.\n\n32:34.320 --> 32:38.920\nMy mom made it very, very clear that I could do anything I wanted.\n\n32:38.920 --> 32:45.880\nAnd at 45, I sometimes like, now I'm entering an age where I'm like, I'm like, what if she\n\n32:45.880 --> 32:46.880\nwas lying?\n\n32:46.880 --> 32:51.680\nLike, and then I'm like, well, too late, like everybody else bought it.\n\n32:51.680 --> 32:52.680\nWhich is probably the idea, right?\n\n32:52.680 --> 32:53.680\nLike that.\n\n32:53.680 --> 32:58.440\nI mean, it is like when we talk about, because I've always used the example when I'm on\n\n32:58.440 --> 33:04.120\npanels and stuff of like, you know, being a guy that like wishes he could, you know,\n\n33:04.120 --> 33:10.240\non some regard, as far as doing the right thing with a job that is very like, not a\n\n33:10.240 --> 33:19.040\ncakewalk, but an honor privilege, like a rare thing to come by this job, like my white guilt\n\n33:19.040 --> 33:24.920\nand stuff and like always makes me, what am I supposed to do to like take my little piece\n\n33:24.920 --> 33:30.480\nof the industry and like try to like make sure I left it a little better than I came\n\n33:30.480 --> 33:37.480\ninto it and the metaphor that I've constantly used is like the problem isn't that, you know,\n\n33:37.480 --> 33:41.720\nwe can talk about representation of the writers and all these things, but like we've the syndrome\n\n33:41.720 --> 33:52.440\nends the day that a black girl in sixth grade right now is watching TV and going like, oh,\n\n33:52.440 --> 33:59.680\nI think I'll try writing that, which I just don't think it was in when I was your age,\n\n33:59.680 --> 34:05.640\nprobably I won't ask the, I think that I don't think that that was even a remote, it was like,\n\n34:05.640 --> 34:08.680\nthat's what we talked, I think that's what we're getting at when we talk about those\n\n34:08.680 --> 34:13.520\nsystemic like, yeah, problems that are that are now, we're not going to pretend that they're\n\n34:13.520 --> 34:18.160\nending, but that that that we'd noticed that the actual like profound changes are coming\n\n34:18.160 --> 34:22.720\nin the form of show running, like, yeah, I mean, Shonda Rhimes was like, when I first\n\n34:22.720 --> 34:26.800\nwatched Grey's Anatomy, and then, because you know, since Seattle, it's really, we're\n\n34:26.800 --> 34:31.280\ngoing to watch the show, and then when I saw a picture of her for the first time, because\n\n34:31.280 --> 34:36.000\nlike, you don't see to the showrunner, you know, unless it's, so the first time I saw\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:39.680\na picture of her, and I was like, oh my God, like this black, Shonda Rhimes could be like\n\n34:39.680 --> 34:47.400\nan old Jewish guy, it's kind of like, Shonda, we're going for lunch and working on the rewrites,\n\n34:47.400 --> 34:51.480\nlike could have been, and then I saw the picture and I was like, I think that was like, that\n\n34:51.480 --> 34:57.840\nwas a very important thing for me, like, oh, she's doing this, and that that person exists\n\n34:57.840 --> 34:58.840\nand is doing this.\n\n34:58.840 --> 34:59.840\nIt's a job.\n\n34:59.840 --> 35:00.840\nIt's a job you can do.\n\n35:00.840 --> 35:06.640\nIt's like, like, yeah, I just think, and I, it's not, I was just, you know, like I go\n\n35:06.640 --> 35:11.560\nto the extreme place with like little black girl, like that image, but it's like little\n\n35:11.560 --> 35:12.560\nkids in general.\n\n35:12.560 --> 35:13.560\nYeah.\n\n35:13.560 --> 35:14.560\nBut herein lies the problem.\n\n35:14.560 --> 35:19.160\nNow, like, in terms of your biography to segue into that, because I always feel like\n\n35:19.160 --> 35:24.960\nthen, but we can't tell people to take a shot at this job.\n\n35:24.960 --> 35:28.280\nIt would, it's, there's part of that is extremely irresponsible.\n\n35:28.280 --> 35:32.600\nIt would be more responsible to tell somebody to try being a doctor, because there's like\n\n35:32.600 --> 35:41.840\ndefinitive milestones, scholarships, tests, a million chances for you to, for you and\n\n35:41.840 --> 35:45.880\nI as somebody who might say to somebody, you should be a writer, like, like for us to have\n\n35:45.880 --> 35:48.280\nsent that person on a path to hell.\n\n35:48.280 --> 35:49.280\nYeah.\n\n35:49.280 --> 35:54.600\nIt seems like something, I don't know, like, I, one of the things I hate is when someone\n\n35:54.600 --> 35:58.200\nlike wins an award, like, and, you know, and they're up there and they're like, follow\n\n35:58.200 --> 35:59.200\nyour dreams.\n\n35:59.200 --> 36:00.200\nYou can do anything.\n\n36:00.200 --> 36:01.600\nIt's like, are you good at that thing though?\n\n36:01.600 --> 36:04.040\nBecause you shouldn't be telling people who are bad at something.\n\n36:04.040 --> 36:09.960\nLike you, at a certain point, you know, I think you have an inkling of like, can I do\n\n36:09.960 --> 36:10.960\nthis?\n\n36:10.960 --> 36:12.160\nIs this really like, is this possible?\n\n36:12.160 --> 36:14.040\nDo I believe in myself, whatever?\n\n36:14.040 --> 36:17.880\nAnd like, I don't think you should be like, I think that's an important thing to remember.\n\n36:17.880 --> 36:22.720\nBut also, we got to be honest, like even a lower middle class white guy like myself,\n\n36:22.720 --> 36:26.960\nI think like there is a support system there.\n\n36:26.960 --> 36:33.000\nI mean, I was borrowing money from my mom for, you know, well into my twenties.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:38.240\nAnd like, my mom was like, yeah, you, you look like a comedian.\n\n36:38.240 --> 36:39.240\nYou look like a writer.\n\n36:39.240 --> 36:43.400\nYou know, here's another three grand for, you know, what really turned out to be cocaine\n\n36:43.400 --> 36:53.840\nand weed and like, but like, it was like, I can't fathom that that exists in, in the\n\n36:53.840 --> 36:58.800\nneighborhoods that would, that it would be important for that to be because it's like,\n\n36:58.800 --> 37:02.480\nbut that's where my brain turns into a balloon animal because I'm like, you can't tell a\n\n37:02.480 --> 37:08.280\npoor kid, like a dirt poor kid, um, yeah, you should go, you should try being a writer.\n\n37:08.280 --> 37:10.280\nYou can, your dreams, you can do anything.\n\n37:10.280 --> 37:12.040\nIt's like, no, we can't.\n\n37:12.040 --> 37:13.040\nYeah.\n\n37:13.040 --> 37:19.280\nAnd like I, in a lot of ways, like my, when I was living in New York, um, I was working\n\n37:19.280 --> 37:23.800\nin PR and I had, um, I was just like blogging all the time.\n\n37:23.800 --> 37:27.000\nAnd so Jezebel had offered me an editorial fellowship.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:30.680\nSo that was a job that was at the time it was part time minimum wage.\n\n37:30.680 --> 37:33.720\nAnd it was something where like, if I had asked my parents for help, they would have,\n\n37:33.720 --> 37:37.280\nif I was like, this is my dream, they would have, they would have helped me.\n\n37:37.280 --> 37:40.400\nThey would have supported me and I, and I knew that I had that as an option.\n\n37:40.400 --> 37:45.640\nUm, but I also was just like, I don't want to ask them for help for something that I'm\n\n37:45.640 --> 37:48.160\nnot like, Oh, this is, this is like the dream.\n\n37:48.160 --> 37:52.800\nUm, I like to save my big favors for, you know, when like I really need it.\n\n37:52.800 --> 37:54.400\nAnd I was like, I don't know if I need this bad enough.\n\n37:54.400 --> 37:57.280\nUm, I also want to lower my $3,000 number.\n\n37:57.280 --> 37:59.680\nThat was me adjusting for like Trump dollars.\n\n37:59.680 --> 38:03.720\nUm, uh, you know, my, that was like $100.\n\n38:03.720 --> 38:06.800\nI never got, I never got more than you can get out of an ATM from my mom.\n\n38:06.800 --> 38:10.120\nNo, but like, I definitely spent it all on Coke and weed.\n\n38:10.120 --> 38:14.560\nLike, so it really wasn't privilege, like I didn't spend it on a typewriter, right?\n\n38:14.560 --> 38:16.040\nUm, but yeah.\n\n38:16.040 --> 38:19.240\nAnd also I want to put another asterisk on something I said, because if they're, it's\n\n38:19.240 --> 38:24.240\nlike, like, no, no, they can't, they can't, it's like, well, no, I mean, it's, it's not\n\n38:24.240 --> 38:25.240\nas easy.\n\n38:25.240 --> 38:26.240\nThere's no equivalent.\n\n38:26.240 --> 38:30.120\nAnd if you don't know anyone, like one of the, the most helpful things for me is when\n\n38:30.120 --> 38:35.640\nI moved LA and I started meeting TV writers and I was like, Oh, these people are not that\n\n38:35.640 --> 38:36.640\nimpressive.\n\n38:36.640 --> 38:40.800\nSurely I can figure this out if these dumb, dumb figured it out.\n\n38:40.800 --> 38:44.640\nAnd like, I think that was really important to like realize that like, Oh, these are just\n\n38:44.640 --> 38:45.640\nregular.\n\n38:45.640 --> 38:50.560\nMost of them are regular people doing this, but like if you don't live in LA and you're\n\n38:50.560 --> 38:53.640\nnot around those people, I have no idea how you would figure that out.\n\n38:53.640 --> 38:56.080\nLike it seems like this mythical unreachable thing.\n\n38:56.080 --> 38:57.080\nYeah.\n\n38:57.080 --> 39:03.200\nIt's difficult to figure out when the actual empire that is the geographically located Hollywood\n\n39:03.200 --> 39:10.560\nwill just bottom out because it seems by a logical assessment that it's a total non-necessity\n\n39:10.560 --> 39:11.560\nanymore.\n\n39:11.560 --> 39:15.040\nAnd we know that people are shooting things in Portland and Vancouver and all over and\n\n39:15.040 --> 39:20.040\nthat a city, a city going broke now a great way for them is to give tax incentives and\n\n39:20.040 --> 39:22.000\nsay, come shoot here and we will do it.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:24.920\nSo you keep, I keep wondering like, why are we here?\n\n39:24.920 --> 39:25.920\nWhat's going on?\n\n39:25.920 --> 39:30.320\nBut it, that's one thing that hasn't changed in 50 years is like, Oh yeah, you move to\n\n39:30.320 --> 39:37.000\nLA and you get a drink in a bar and you are immediately gaining some kind of advantage\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:42.960\nover someone who's in Minneapolis aspiring to, to write one day because you're just,\n\n39:42.960 --> 39:43.960\nit's just erosion.\n\n39:43.960 --> 39:47.240\nIt's just, it's just like you're, you're going to run into somebody, you're going to\n\n39:47.240 --> 39:51.880\noverhear jokes, you're going to, like you're just, you're just getting desensitized to\n\n39:51.880 --> 39:56.440\nwhat is otherwise an impossibly mythical kingdom.\n\n39:56.440 --> 39:57.440\nAnd you're right.\n\n39:57.440 --> 39:59.560\nIt's just a bunch of normal morons.\n\n39:59.560 --> 40:02.160\nYou know, like we're just, we're just piddling around out here.\n\n40:02.160 --> 40:05.800\nLike we're plumbers that, that, that didn't have to qualify for anything.\n\n40:05.800 --> 40:09.440\nWe don't, we don't even have to, you, you, because you keep, there's no, there's no\n\n40:09.440 --> 40:10.440\nbar.\n\n40:10.440 --> 40:11.440\nYou really have to.\n\n40:11.440 --> 40:12.440\nYeah.\n\n40:12.440 --> 40:14.240\nLike you can't prove that the toilet is leaking in writing.\n\n40:14.240 --> 40:18.360\nYou can, you can say it, but we can also go, well, I think you have bad taste.\n\n40:18.360 --> 40:21.480\nI don't think you really understand what a toilet is, sir.\n\n40:21.480 --> 40:27.480\nUm, it, uh, but, but yeah, specifically like class wise, where would you place yourself\n\n40:27.480 --> 40:28.480\ngrowing up?\n\n40:28.480 --> 40:32.000\nUm, I mean, my dad, my dad worked at Microsoft.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:35.400\nThat's why he grew up in Seattle, but we moved back.\n\n40:35.400 --> 40:39.960\nSo like, you know, I went to, I went to a private school, I went to a private university.\n\n40:39.960 --> 40:44.600\nSo like I, you know, I don't, I had a lot of friends, I had a lot of friends that were\n\n40:44.600 --> 40:46.520\nlike very wealthy.\n\n40:46.520 --> 40:49.600\nAnd so I knew we weren't that, but I was like, we're fine.\n\n40:49.600 --> 40:54.880\nSo I didn't, you know, we weren't like, but life was nice for sure.\n\n40:54.880 --> 41:00.440\nWhat do you think Schrabs thinking over there, how, how is growing up for you?\n\n41:00.440 --> 41:02.160\nIt is all right.\n\n41:02.160 --> 41:04.160\nIt was okay.\n\n41:04.160 --> 41:12.320\nI lived in a small town and I drew a lot and I made like stop motion animated movies.\n\n41:12.320 --> 41:13.320\nThat's fun.\n\n41:13.320 --> 41:17.720\nAnd, uh, Schrabs hometown, Mayville, Wisconsin, there's a billboard outside of it.\n\n41:17.720 --> 41:22.680\nYou know, like, like how towns have signs with logos and slogans and things.\n\n41:22.680 --> 41:28.200\nAnd, uh, Mayville was, um, was, uh, the last stop where you could get like supplies if\n\n41:28.200 --> 41:33.280\nyou were going to go to a place called Horicon, which is like, um, um, duck hunting territory.\n\n41:33.280 --> 41:34.280\nOkay.\n\n41:34.280 --> 41:37.240\nAnd, uh, and so that was like a big thing for a town of that size.\n\n41:37.240 --> 41:43.080\nSo the, the sign outside of Rob's hometown says, welcome to Mayville gateway to the marsh.\n\n41:43.080 --> 41:44.080\nYeah.\n\n41:44.080 --> 41:45.080\nWow.\n\n41:45.080 --> 41:46.080\nYeah.\n\n41:46.080 --> 41:47.080\nWow.\n\n41:47.080 --> 41:49.080\nAnd one, I was not jealous of that.\n\n41:49.080 --> 41:50.080\nI know.\n\n41:50.080 --> 41:58.600\nAnd one, one, there was like a time where McDonald's, I come from like a 3000, 5000 population\n\n41:58.600 --> 42:05.080\ntown and they, we had a McDonald's in town and that was a big deal and McDonald's gave\n\n42:05.080 --> 42:12.240\nus a sign that said with Ronald McDonald on it and it said, Mayville gateway to the marsh.\n\n42:12.240 --> 42:14.440\nOh, Ronald McDonald was on that sign.\n\n42:14.440 --> 42:15.440\nOn it.\n\n42:15.440 --> 42:16.440\nI don't know if I ever could.\n\n42:16.440 --> 42:17.960\nLike going, Hey, we own you now.\n\n42:17.960 --> 42:18.960\nThat's hilarious.\n\n42:18.960 --> 42:24.840\nIt's, it's like Adderall giving you a defibrillator, but they, but the, the town wasn't big enough\n\n42:24.840 --> 42:31.640\nand they went, they closed down McDonald's and they took the sign away, they took the\n\n42:31.640 --> 42:34.560\nsign away, took the sign away.\n\n42:34.560 --> 42:41.240\nI guess they didn't want to get sued by somebody who was like, look, I'm, I have reverse diabetes.\n\n42:41.240 --> 42:47.720\nI need, I needed a, a big Mac and you made me think I could get one here.\n\n42:47.720 --> 42:49.160\nI was expecting a McDonald's.\n\n42:49.160 --> 42:52.760\nI'm suing you for all your duck ammunition and then they turned, they, they turned the\n\n42:52.760 --> 42:57.000\nMcDonald's that they was bought and turned into a mom and pop burger shop.\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.760\nIt was called Bumpy Burgers.\n\n42:59.760 --> 43:00.760\nThat's maybe better.\n\n43:00.760 --> 43:01.760\nRight.\n\n43:01.760 --> 43:02.760\nBumpy.\n\n43:02.760 --> 43:03.760\nI don't know.\n\n43:03.760 --> 43:04.760\nMom and pop.\n\n43:04.760 --> 43:09.120\nYou know, that seems on, on brand for what this town sounds like to me.\n\n43:09.120 --> 43:10.120\nYeah.\n\n43:10.120 --> 43:11.640\nIt's grown, it's done for its season.\n\n43:11.640 --> 43:12.640\nYou do.\n\n43:12.640 --> 43:13.640\nYou're finishing the whole season.\n\n43:13.640 --> 43:14.640\nYeah.\n\n43:14.640 --> 43:15.640\nWe finished.\n\n43:15.640 --> 43:16.640\nWe got a.\n\n43:16.640 --> 43:17.640\nAre we done?\n\n43:17.640 --> 43:18.640\nYeah.\n\n43:18.640 --> 43:19.640\nI move around.\n\n43:19.640 --> 43:20.640\nI stir.\n\n43:20.640 --> 43:21.640\nOkay.\n\n43:21.640 --> 43:22.640\nI'm a good host.\n\n43:22.640 --> 43:23.640\nAll right.\n\n43:23.640 --> 43:25.640\nUm, we got a second season, 20 episode order.\n\n43:25.640 --> 43:26.640\nSo.\n\n43:26.640 --> 43:27.640\nOh, cool.\n\n43:27.640 --> 43:28.640\nIt's, it's happening.\n\n43:28.640 --> 43:29.640\nWhat network is that?\n\n43:29.640 --> 43:32.640\nIt's on free form, which is what ABC family family.\n\n43:32.640 --> 43:33.640\nYeah.\n\n43:33.640 --> 43:34.640\nOh, okay.\n\n43:34.640 --> 43:35.640\nIt's rebranding.\n\n43:35.640 --> 43:40.040\nSo it sounds like it's like one of these internet channels, but it's real TV.\n\n43:40.040 --> 43:41.040\nIt's real TV.\n\n43:41.040 --> 43:42.040\nAnd it's TV.\n\n43:42.040 --> 43:43.040\nWe get to say shit.\n\n43:43.040 --> 43:44.040\nYeah.\n\n43:44.040 --> 43:45.040\nWe get to bleep out a fuck.\n\n43:45.040 --> 43:46.040\nYeah.\n\n43:46.040 --> 43:47.040\nIt's exciting to me.\n\n43:47.040 --> 43:48.040\nI've, I've had several.\n\n43:48.040 --> 43:52.200\nI got, I got projects going where the big, you know, like I'm not allowed to talk about\n\n43:52.200 --> 43:53.200\nthem yet.\n\n43:53.200 --> 43:54.200\nBecause then you get to do a thing.\n\n43:54.200 --> 43:56.520\nBut like there's, they're right.\n\n43:56.520 --> 44:02.040\nI'm very excited about what, what do you mean you're not allowed to talk about it?\n\n44:02.040 --> 44:06.760\nI mean, like what, what's the worst that's going to happen if you start talking about\n\n44:06.760 --> 44:07.760\nit?\n\n44:07.760 --> 44:08.760\nThey will.\n\n44:08.760 --> 44:09.760\nBut they'll take it away.\n\n44:09.760 --> 44:10.760\nIt'll be fine.\n\n44:10.760 --> 44:11.760\nI don't, I don't know.\n\n44:11.760 --> 44:16.440\nI just know, like, if you don't like to try and see, I've, I've, I've, I've tried\n\n44:16.440 --> 44:22.400\nto, I've done my 20 years of seeing what the worst could, that could happen is if I say\n\n44:22.400 --> 44:23.400\nstuff.\n\n44:23.400 --> 44:24.400\nAnd you're still here.\n\n44:24.400 --> 44:25.400\nI know.\n\n44:25.400 --> 44:26.400\nSo like now.\n\n44:26.400 --> 44:27.400\nWhat are you afraid of?\n\n44:27.400 --> 44:30.440\nKevin Smith just said to me when I was talking to him, he's like, cause he's going vegan\n\n44:30.440 --> 44:31.440\nbecause he just had his heart attack.\n\n44:31.440 --> 44:34.440\nAnd he's like, he's got friends that are like, well, it was now just cause you have a heart\n\n44:34.440 --> 44:35.440\nattack.\n\n44:35.440 --> 44:36.440\nYou're a pussy.\n\n44:36.440 --> 44:38.400\nHe's like, I ate meat forever.\n\n44:38.400 --> 44:41.040\nI'm now interested in vegetables.\n\n44:41.040 --> 44:43.800\nHe's not like, he's not like hit me with your best shot.\n\n44:43.800 --> 44:46.800\nHe's like, I now have polio.\n\n44:46.800 --> 44:51.800\nI mean, I'm just like, no, it's an, I mean, I'm, I'm tired, man.\n\n44:51.800 --> 44:56.440\nI'm Gandalf the, the, uh, beyond gray.\n\n44:56.440 --> 45:00.640\nIt looks like Spencer's wearing the table as shorts.\n\n45:00.640 --> 45:01.640\nI

45:36.960\nand you moved on.\n\n45:36.960 --> 45:38.960\nWhat was so great about bumpy burgers?\n\n45:38.960 --> 45:39.960\nWhat happened there?\n\n45:39.960 --> 45:46.840\nWe were talking about something, had something, she wasn't patronizing you.\n\n45:46.840 --> 45:48.040\nYou don't know that.\n\n45:48.040 --> 45:49.480\nI, I was interested.\n\n45:49.480 --> 45:50.480\nOkay.\n\n45:50.480 --> 45:51.480\nThank you.\n\n45:51.480 --> 45:53.080\nWell, you know, I have a weird form of burger.\n\n45:53.080 --> 45:55.600\nI'll give you two more minutes on bumpy burgers.\n\n45:55.600 --> 45:58.760\nNo, I don't want to talk about it anymore.\n\n45:58.760 --> 45:59.760\nOkay.\n\n45:59.760 --> 46:00.760\nI was good.\n\n46:00.760 --> 46:04.080\nI'm, you know, I like to move around, you know, organically.\n\n46:04.080 --> 46:05.080\nYeah.\n\n46:05.080 --> 46:09.800\nYou got a second to anyways, by the way, my little joke, now I have to call it a joke\n\n46:09.800 --> 46:11.080\nand then I have to tell it.\n\n46:11.080 --> 46:12.080\nAnd it's just like, this is a worst.\n\n46:12.080 --> 46:16.040\nI was going to say this little cause I was going to say, well, no, I do, I do have to\n\n46:16.040 --> 46:18.040\nmeet.\n\n46:18.040 --> 46:19.040\nI'm not stopping you.\n\n46:19.040 --> 46:23.560\nPlease do the LA story where she has to finish the shave and a haircut on the tuba.\n\n46:23.560 --> 46:27.880\nLike, you know, but did she have to?\n\n46:27.880 --> 46:31.280\nThat's why I mean it needs, I laughed at it because I knew she had to.\n\n46:31.280 --> 46:32.280\nI got it.\n\n46:32.280 --> 46:34.360\nI knew she had to finish her shave and a haircut.\n\n46:34.360 --> 46:37.520\nI, I don't remember this.\n\n46:37.520 --> 46:38.520\nI'm not going to.\n\n46:38.520 --> 46:39.520\nOkay.\n\n46:39.520 --> 46:41.080\nI didn't want you to not finish it.\n\n46:41.080 --> 46:42.080\nAnd you know what?\n\n46:42.080 --> 46:43.080\nIt wasn't a joke.\n\n46:43.080 --> 46:44.080\nIt was just a stupid turn of phrase.\n\n46:44.080 --> 46:45.080\nI was just dumb.\n\n46:45.080 --> 46:49.200\nI wasn't even, I was making it up as I went and it's just, but I don't like getting interrupted.\n\n46:49.200 --> 46:54.080\nBut it's like, well, then why do I have a show if I don't like getting interrupted?\n\n46:54.080 --> 46:55.080\nWhat's going on?\n\n46:55.080 --> 46:56.080\nYou know what?\n\n46:56.080 --> 46:57.080\nI would do it.\n\n46:57.080 --> 46:58.080\nAre we on a pirate ship?\n\n46:58.080 --> 46:59.080\nWhy?\n\n46:59.080 --> 47:00.080\nWhere is it?\n\n47:00.080 --> 47:01.080\nWhy is everything creaking?\n\n47:01.080 --> 47:02.080\nWe are taking on water.\n\n47:02.080 --> 47:04.200\nIf I didn't want to get interrupted, you know what I'd do is just never talk.\n\n47:04.200 --> 47:05.200\nYeah.\n\n47:05.200 --> 47:09.480\nWell, that's why it works for me, right?\n\n47:09.480 --> 47:12.360\nOr it could be a man, that helps also.\n\n47:12.360 --> 47:13.360\nOh yeah.\n\n47:13.360 --> 47:18.720\nUm, but what do you, what are your aspirations because I'm not, do you know, I mean, you\n\n47:18.720 --> 47:24.360\nhave to, you, you have to wait and see, are you, is your job a guarantee on season two\n\n47:24.360 --> 47:27.600\nor do you just wait and like, you know, I, I'm pretty sure.\n\n47:27.600 --> 47:28.600\nYeah.\n\n47:28.600 --> 47:36.640\nOh, the glimmer in the eye was, you'll have to pay $5 a month to see that the true confidence\n\n47:36.640 --> 47:40.080\nof a, of a staff writer that nailed it in season one.\n\n47:40.080 --> 47:41.080\nYeah.\n\n47:41.080 --> 47:43.880\nI think you're looking at a story editor.\n\n47:43.880 --> 47:46.480\nUm, uh, well that's cool.\n\n47:46.480 --> 47:47.480\nBut yeah.\n\n47:47.480 --> 47:56.240\nAnd then, and then like, long mid, mid, midterm ambitions, like, like if, if grown-ish keeps\n\n47:56.240 --> 48:04.240\ngoing for years and years and years, do you see yourself, uh, you know, gaining more levels\n\n48:04.240 --> 48:09.600\nin that, or do you, are you chomping at, champing at the bit to, um, are you champing at the\n\n48:09.600 --> 48:10.600\nbit?\n\n48:10.600 --> 48:11.600\nI am champing.\n\n48:11.600 --> 48:18.040\nShe went to private schools, she knows it's champing, but champing sounds wrong cause everyone\n\n48:18.040 --> 48:19.040\nsays chomping.\n\n48:19.040 --> 48:20.040\nRight.\n\n48:20.040 --> 48:21.040\nThey don't know.\n\n48:21.040 --> 48:23.680\nIt's just like Fort, instead of Forte.\n\n48:23.680 --> 48:24.680\nYes.\n\n48:24.680 --> 48:25.680\nExactly.\n\n48:25.680 --> 48:26.680\nLike that.\n\n48:26.680 --> 48:27.680\nShit drives me nuts.\n\n48:27.680 --> 48:28.680\nYeah.\n\n48:28.680 --> 48:30.680\nDrives me nuts too.\n\n48:30.680 --> 48:36.400\nWhy don't you go draw something, draw a cube in perspective?\n\n48:36.400 --> 48:40.440\nDo you guys remember that game, draw something?\n\n48:40.440 --> 48:41.440\nYou played it on your phone?\n\n48:41.440 --> 48:42.440\nYeah.\n\n48:42.440 --> 48:43.440\nWith friends.\n\n48:43.440 --> 48:44.440\nYeah.\n\n48:44.440 --> 48:45.440\nI was pretty addicted to that.\n\n48:45.440 --> 48:46.440\nI was the best.\n\n48:46.440 --> 48:48.960\nThe only time I would ever lose is when it was asterix, which is like some fucking cartoon\n\n48:48.960 --> 48:52.400\ncharacter in Deutschland or something.\n\n48:52.400 --> 48:54.800\nAnd it's just like, it's not a real word.\n\n48:54.800 --> 48:57.720\nSo how could you guess something that's a, a made up word?\n\n48:57.720 --> 48:59.120\nYou could never guess that.\n\n48:59.120 --> 49:00.120\nAnyway.\n\n49:00.120 --> 49:01.120\nYou ever play that game?\n\n49:01.120 --> 49:04.480\nI don't know what it, I don't know what it's called cause I've only, it's just like a,\n\n49:04.480 --> 49:09.160\nit's not like a thing you buy at Toys R Us, but it's like a game where you, it's like\n\n49:09.160 --> 49:15.160\na party game where you, everyone writes a phrase and then you pass the stack of papers\n\n49:15.160 --> 49:17.640\nand then you look at the phrase and then you draw.\n\n49:17.640 --> 49:18.640\nCrossword.\n\n49:18.640 --> 49:19.640\nThe phrase.\n\n49:19.640 --> 49:20.640\nSTPs.\n\n49:20.640 --> 49:23.280\nAnd then you pass that and it's like a telephone game that comes back around to you.\n\n49:23.280 --> 49:28.120\nSo you write Ghostbusters on the top sheet and then you hand it off and you get like\n\n49:28.120 --> 49:33.200\nPudding Pops or whatever and you, you try to draw Pudding Pops because that's what you're\n\n49:33.200 --> 49:34.200\nreading.\n\n49:34.200 --> 49:35.200\nYou got it wrong.\n\n49:35.200 --> 49:36.200\nAnd, and...\n\n49:36.200 --> 49:38.120\nI didn't know if you're past Pudding Pops.\n\n49:38.120 --> 49:43.880\nAnyways, it comes back around and you've got, you're like, well, I, I wrote Ghostbusters\n\n49:43.880 --> 49:48.520\nand then this is how Amanda drew Ghostbusters and because that's what she drew, this is\n\n49:48.520 --> 49:52.200\nwhat the next person wrote and then it's kind of, it's really fun.\n\n49:52.200 --> 49:53.200\nOh, I get it.\n\n49:53.200 --> 49:54.200\nI have not played.\n\n49:54.200 --> 49:57.840\nAre there other movies besides Ghostbusters that you can write down?\n\n49:57.840 --> 49:58.840\nYeah.\n\n49:58.840 --> 49:59.840\nPudding Pops.\n\n49:59.840 --> 50:00.840\nYeah.\n\n50:00.840 --> 50:01.840\nI just...\n\n50:01.840 --> 50:02.840\nI haven't seen that.\n\n50:02.840 --> 50:03.840\nGhostbusters was, we tried it.\n\n50:03.840 --> 50:08.240\nOur friend KK was so drunk that we were like, it's because there's always one drunk person\n\n50:08.240 --> 50:14.160\nin the game that like either ruins it or makes it like worth playing depending on how you\n\n50:14.160 --> 50:15.160\nlook at it.\n\n50:15.160 --> 50:20.200\nBut like my friend Dino just wrote Ghostbusters and he's like, it's a movie with a logo even\n\n50:20.200 --> 50:22.600\nif you drop badly than the next person will.\n\n50:22.600 --> 50:28.360\nAnd then it went through KK and it was like, it, it came out as like this, like there were\n\n50:28.360 --> 50:34.600\nguys like pointing things at a giant peanut and it was crying and it's just such a great\n\n50:34.600 --> 50:38.240\ngame because then the next person is like a giant peanut and then you're like, you have\n\n50:38.240 --> 50:39.240\nto, that's so fun.\n\n50:39.240 --> 50:41.560\nWe should make a phone version of it.\n\n50:41.560 --> 50:46.600\nOr we should, we should, we should, we should have a society that effectively reproduces\n\n50:46.600 --> 50:49.880\nthe effects so that by the 21st century we're almost dead.\n\n50:49.880 --> 50:51.840\nLet's talk about politics a little bit.\n\n50:51.840 --> 50:53.280\nYou're, you're, you're a millennial.\n\n50:53.280 --> 50:56.120\nAre you hopeful or are you like stocking canned goods?\n\n50:56.120 --> 51:00.400\nI, you know, actually, so one of the, one of the writers in our room, she was telling\n\n51:00.400 --> 51:04.880\nus how she and her husband had just bought gas masks and was like, didn't see never\n\n51:04.880 --> 51:05.880\ngoing to go buy a gas mask.\n\n51:05.880 --> 51:09.320\nSo I was like, okay, so I went to Amazon and they were like 80 bucks, which was like\n\n51:09.320 --> 51:16.000\na little more than I felt like, like if it had been like 45 or 50, what did like say\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:21.440\na friend of yours had an, an extra gas mask.\n\n51:21.440 --> 51:23.160\nAnd you wanted to try it out.\n\n51:23.160 --> 51:24.160\nOh God.\n\n51:24.160 --> 51:27.640\nWell, would you be like a cheapy peepy?\n\n51:27.640 --> 51:31.080\nIf you, you know what it made me realize that I didn't want to spend, if I wasn't willing\n\n51:31.080 --> 51:35.760\nto spend $80 on a gas mask, I was like, I think if I need a gas mask, I'd like to be\n\n51:35.760 --> 51:36.760\ndead.\n\n51:36.760 --> 51:37.760\nI was like, I don't want to be here.\n\n51:37.760 --> 51:38.960\nWe have to run around and gas masks.\n\n51:38.960 --> 51:41.960\nI hope I go out and the, I don't want, I don't want to have to have to come back.\n\n51:41.960 --> 51:42.960\nYou're going to breathe it in.\n\n51:42.960 --> 51:46.160\nYou're going to be like, I just want to breathe it and then I'll go.\n\n51:46.160 --> 51:50.640\nMy only thought about, that's how I feel about a nuclear strike, like I'm not going to get\n\n51:50.640 --> 51:58.640\nin the car and head for Prim Nevada so that I can have half a face for 10 years.\n\n51:58.640 --> 52:04.200\nI'm just, I'm going to like run to the impact point and like try to catch the missile in\n\n52:04.200 --> 52:07.840\nmy teeth because I want to like die in a flash.\n\n52:07.840 --> 52:09.640\nBut gas mask, I don't know.\n\n52:09.640 --> 52:15.040\nI don't want, because the way you die by things that, that kill you by inhaling them\n\n52:15.040 --> 52:16.800\nmake you suffer.\n\n52:16.800 --> 52:22.080\nI want to, I might buy a gas mask so I can make it to my gun.\n\n52:22.080 --> 52:23.580\nI don't have a gun.\n\n52:23.580 --> 52:24.580\nI don't know.\n\n52:24.580 --> 52:25.580\nI was like, I don't have enough stuff.\n\n52:25.580 --> 52:27.560\nI bought a gun when Trump got elected.\n\n52:27.560 --> 52:28.560\nDid you?\n\n52:28.560 --> 52:31.480\nI don't, I just feel like that is part of the problem.\n\n52:31.480 --> 52:32.480\nIt's part, no.\n\n52:32.480 --> 52:33.480\nIt's not part of the problem.\n\n52:33.480 --> 52:34.480\nIt is.\n\n52:34.480 --> 52:35.480\nIt is.\n\n52:35.480 --> 52:38.560\nI've, I've, I've realized it all now, but I still got the gun.\n\n52:38.560 --> 52:42.080\nWhat did you, what did you think you would need the gun for?\n\n52:42.080 --> 52:44.360\nLike what, what made you, like, what did you think would happen now?\n\n52:44.360 --> 52:46.320\nTo shoot his dogs weirdly.\n\n52:46.320 --> 52:47.320\nNo.\n\n52:47.320 --> 52:48.320\nWell, there's that.\n\n52:48.320 --> 52:50.520\nI mean, there's always talking about shooting his dogs these days.\n\n52:50.520 --> 52:51.520\nReally?\n\n52:51.520 --> 52:52.520\nReally?\n\n52:52.520 --> 52:53.520\nReally?\n\n52:53.520 --> 52:54.520\nNo, all the time.\n\n52:54.520 --> 52:55.520\nDon't put a nickel in him.\n\n52:55.520 --> 52:56.520\nReally?\n\n52:56.520 --> 52:57.520\nEvery day he's like, I got to shoot his dogs.\n\n52:57.520 --> 53:01.560\nAll the things you could shoot, you're going to shoot your two dogs.\n\n53:01.560 --> 53:05.960\nWell, I don't, I don't want to derail this, but like at the end of the world, if I'm about\n\n53:05.960 --> 53:10.880\nto kill myself, I don't want my dogs to, well, I guess they, I guess they could eat me.\n\n53:10.880 --> 53:15.840\nI guess I could leave them to eat me and they'd have a couple days of ground chuck to have\n\n53:15.840 --> 53:20.720\nfun with, but like, I was just thinking like, I'll just kill, you know, everybody that\n\n53:20.720 --> 53:21.720\nloves me.\n\n53:21.720 --> 53:22.720\nThat needed context.\n\n53:22.720 --> 53:24.920\nBut, but no, it's not for suicide.\n\n53:24.920 --> 53:30.640\nIt's for, it was for the gun, the gun was definitely overall the most accurate description\n\n53:30.640 --> 53:35.400\nof it, which is my new favorite phrase because it was just like, holy shit, what a wake up\n\n53:35.400 --> 53:37.520\nof like, like white fragility.\n\n53:37.520 --> 53:44.400\nIt was like, I have never had this level of experience, unlike basically all women, all\n\n53:44.400 --> 53:51.320\npeople of color, all people of any identifiable demographic as vanilla man with, well, I thought\n\n53:51.320 --> 53:53.920\nI was an underdog and I thought I was badass.\n\n53:53.920 --> 53:55.320\nI thought I was punk rock.\n\n53:55.320 --> 54:01.240\nI thought I was an anarchist as in let's bring the anarchy like, like, like, and then like,\n\n54:01.240 --> 54:07.640\nI saw my girlfriend crying after an election and I was like, stop crying, you know, and\n\n54:07.640 --> 54:14.280\nlike, and then the tears didn't stop crying and, and, and, and, and then the, and then\n\n54:14.280 --> 54:17.960\nthe waitress came over and she had been crying and then the women were hugging and then,\n\n54:17.960 --> 54:23.440\nand I was like, and then I'm like talking to the other guys and going like, but then,\n\n54:23.440 --> 54:26.280\nbut then I gotta shoot my dogs.\n\n54:26.280 --> 54:30.920\nI gotta go right now and shoot my dogs.\n\n54:30.920 --> 54:35.120\nNow we've come back to, I'm convinced of it again, like I'm back to like, yeah, it's\n\n54:35.120 --> 54:40.560\nhappening again, but, but in the days after the election, I was like, this is happening\n\n54:40.560 --> 54:49.640\nfast and by this, I mean unidentifiable total destabilization, like how hard is it going\n\n54:49.640 --> 54:57.840\nto be for a guy that can, um, uh, the first guy to go out of business in Las Vegas owning\n\n54:57.840 --> 55:03.560\na casino, um, like, like how hard is it going to be for this guy with an already unstable\n\n55:03.560 --> 55:13.040\nglobal, uh, economy to, to just like provoke a polarity shift that just crumbles everything.\n\n55:13.040 --> 55:17.640\nI didn't even think at the time of like, oh, you know, these races are going to start\n\n55:17.640 --> 55:21.680\nclockwork orging and then everyone's going to like it mad and now what I'm scared of\n\n55:21.680 --> 55:25.680\nis that the Mueller report is going to come out and it's like, we already know like he's\n\n55:25.680 --> 55:31.000\ngot, it's going to be, he's a criminal and now we have a constitutional crisis and then\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:36.160\nit's going to be, I'm genuinely like, just a, just a fan theory, civil war is going to\n\n55:36.160 --> 55:40.280\nhappen because like, there's going to be street to street, like fighting people going like,\n\n55:40.280 --> 55:47.240\nand so, but my, the reason I bought the gun is because I'm like, it's a power tool that\n\n55:47.240 --> 55:55.680\nI don't have that like a flashlight is for an earthquake and, um, and a, and a, and a,\n\n55:55.680 --> 56:01.120\nand a drill is for making a bird feeder and, and, and I don't have one of those things\n\n56:01.120 --> 56:04.760\nthat knocks the people down that saw your sparklets bottles.\n\n56:04.760 --> 56:09.320\nLike, like I, that, that, that, that, if I didn't have a girlfriend, I don't know if\n\n56:09.320 --> 56:12.440\nI, because I'd be like, well, what am I, uh, uh, tech savory?\n\n56:12.440 --> 56:17.160\nI'm going to like, like, like enjoy protecting my empty gun with its last 11 bullets.\n\n56:17.160 --> 56:20.720\nI, I, you're going to draw a droopy dog.\n\n56:20.720 --> 56:27.800\nI, I, I, I, it's, it's a home invasion, uh, white fragility, like fear of impotence,\n\n56:27.800 --> 56:33.920\nlike, like, like, like the worst death in the world would be not being able to protect\n\n56:33.920 --> 56:34.920\nmy loved ones.\n\n56:34.920 --> 56:35.920\nYeah.\n\n56:35.920 --> 56:39.240\nLike that's, and then it's like, there's this product and it's like, I'm exactly the\n\n56:39.240 --> 56:40.240\npart of the problem.\n\n56:40.240 --> 56:42.240\nThat's why everyone has a gun.\n\n56:42.240 --> 56:43.240\nYeah.\n\n56:43.240 --> 56:49.520\nI mean, I, I've, I remember right after the election and I was talking to my dad, like\n\n56:49.520 --> 56:52.800\nI was sobbing and I was talking to my dad, or I think it was a couple of days later,\n\n56:52.800 --> 56:53.800\nwas probably still sobbing.\n\n56:53.800 --> 56:58.440\nAnd I asked how my grandmother was my 85 year old grandmother and he was like, she seems\n\n56:58.440 --> 56:59.440\nfine.\n\n56:59.440 --> 57:05.920\nAnd I was like, oh yeah, like she used to look like they used to just like black people\n\n57:05.920 --> 57:09.200\nwalk down the street and then you just never saw them again.\n\n57:09.200 --> 57:13.960\nAnd so part of it was like when I, she, when I talked to her and she was like, yeah, no,\n\n57:13.960 --> 57:14.960\nI hate him.\n\n57:14.960 --> 57:15.960\nThis is terrible.\n\n57:15.960 --> 57:16.960\nAlso, she's like old.\n\n57:16.960 --> 57:20.480\nSo at that point you're like, I don't know, whatever.\n\n57:20.480 --> 57:25.160\nShe's like ice on a porch could be my Donald Trump.\n\n57:25.160 --> 57:26.640\nBut I did think about that.\n\n57:26.640 --> 57:31.240\nI was like, you know, it's, it's been worse.\n\n57:31.240 --> 57:33.680\nSo like there's that.\n\n57:33.680 --> 57:37.720\nBut I've also had to like, I don't know, like I've had to really narrow the shit that I\n\n57:37.720 --> 57:40.560\ncan like really, really care about because I feel like all this other stuff takes so\n\n57:40.560 --> 57:45.120\nmuch energy just to like absorb it and want it and like I don't want to ignore it.\n\n57:45.120 --> 57:49.080\nAnd so I've had to be like, there's like five things I can care about in a real way.\n\n57:49.080 --> 57:52.440\nAnd then I have to like pay attention to all this other shit because it feels necessary\n\n57:52.440 --> 57:54.960\nto pay attention because there's so much.\n\n57:54.960 --> 57:59.760\nAnd even now I'm like, I don't even, there's shit that I don't like names that I see and\n\n57:59.760 --> 58:05.240\nI don't really, I know that it's like a bad thing or there's a, you know, scandal, but\n\n58:05.240 --> 58:07.200\nI don't really know what it is.\n\n58:07.200 --> 58:15.040\nSo as a millennial, I feel, I weirdly actually feel, I feel okay.\n\n58:15.040 --> 58:21.080\nBut going into the midterms, I feel very like just just okay, though, like not on either\n\n58:21.080 --> 58:25.080\nside of it, just like really solidly okay.\n\n58:25.080 --> 58:29.240\nAnd I think it's just because like I have to feel okay, otherwise, like it's just because\n\n58:29.240 --> 58:34.040\nthe alternative is going like, because I went through that phase where I was like, these\n\n58:34.040 --> 58:38.840\nguys are all acting like there aren't going to be free and fair elections in 2018.\n\n58:38.840 --> 58:41.200\nThey still kind of are.\n\n58:41.200 --> 58:43.640\nBut now it's, I mean, and I'm not, I'm not arguing.\n\n58:43.640 --> 58:47.280\nI'm not saying that I'm still willing to believe in the worst nightmare, but now there's this\n\n58:47.280 --> 58:53.640\nother theory because the behaviors become so incredibly like clownish that I'm like,\n\n58:53.640 --> 58:58.960\noh, maybe they are just, they just thought they just, they're just dumb.\n\n58:58.960 --> 59:02.480\nLike I know they're, they were always dumb, but like not dumb and knew something that\n\n59:02.480 --> 59:06.880\nI didn't like, maybe they're just idiots.\n\n59:06.880 --> 59:12.240\nI think most of the people who knew stuff seem like they're kind of gone.\n\n59:12.240 --> 59:14.840\nLike it feels like mostly idiots left.\n\n59:14.840 --> 59:15.840\nYeah.\n\n59:15.840 --> 59:16.840\nYeah.\n\n59:16.840 --> 59:21.600\nAnd it's like the people that knew stuff were like, oh, this shit we knew, the jig is up.\n\n59:21.600 --> 59:24.800\nWe can't leave a paper trail like, and he's just like, you're fired.\n\n59:24.800 --> 59:25.800\nYou're fired.\n\n59:25.800 --> 59:26.800\nYou're fired.\n\n59:26.800 --> 59:31.480\nAnd it's like, those are all the people that were like either a, just want to say, I don't,\n\n59:31.480 --> 59:36.600\nI think this might be illegal later and or the people that were like, we should do this\n\n59:36.600 --> 59:37.600\nillegal thing.\n\n59:37.600 --> 59:40.960\nLike both categories of people, that's a really interesting way of looking at it.\n\n59:40.960 --> 59:46.200\nLike he's like, he's just, but is that like, it's just this absurd thing about like, he's\n\n59:46.200 --> 59:51.360\njust like the, you're fired guy and now he's just, you're firing is like, could you become\n\n59:51.360 --> 59:52.360\nCaesar that way?\n\n59:52.360 --> 59:57.720\nCould you just fire every Roman senator and then fire the executive branch and fire the,\n\n59:57.720 --> 59:58.720\noh wait, no, that's me.\n\n59:58.720 --> 59:59.720\nOkay.\n\n59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.320\nI'll hire, I'll promote the executive branch.\n\n01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:06.320\nI'm going to fire this, the fire, the constitution, like, is he just going to fire that?\n\n01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.640\nI'm sure he, I bet you he thinks he can like fire a Supreme Court judge.\n\n01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:16.240\nNothing is the only thing he's ever done that my dad would call running a business.\n\n01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.160\nLike my dad, who's like an actual businessman, like, like, I think, I bet that's the only\n\n01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:26.920\nthing he's ever done that was like, I bet he's never filed taxes or like, cash to check\n\n01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:32.800\nor like, put, balance the ledger or, or like looked at a pie chart, like, but he's just,\n\n01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.800\nhe's just fired people.\n\n01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:39.840\nHe's just, he thinks it's just like, anyways, I think if, I think if we can, I think if\n\n01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.440\nafter the midterms, I don't feel like, I feel like talk to me again after that.\n\n01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.440\nYeah.\n\n01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.640\nBecause if, if I still feel this shitty, like next January, that it's like, and assuming\n\n01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:54.480\nmaybe we flipped things, then it's like, oh, we're super fucked.\n\n01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.480\nSo, yeah.\n\n01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.360\nBut you'll have made a lot of pasta by them.\n\n01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.240\nI've made a lot of pasta by them.\n\n01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.240\nI will.\n\n01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.240\nThat's gotta be, you think that's a thing that's like a phenomenon in America is like,\n\n01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.040\npeople have these Trump hobbies, they're like, if it's going to be four years, I might as\n\n01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.720\nwell take up bonsai tree farming or like something.\n\n01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.280\nNo, I think, and people gained a lot of weight apparently after the election.\n\n01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.040\nThey were just like, I stayed home for weeks.\n\n01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.040\nYeah.\n\n01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.120\nI put on a lot of weight.\n\n01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.960\nAnd then in 2018, and I was like, I'm going to start working out and also buying again.\n\n01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.600\nI think, I think absolutely, like everybody like, we're all going to, there's going to\n\n01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.560\nbe like some equivalent of the baby boom, but instead of just being a population explosion,\n\n01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.640\nit's going to be like a weird hobby explosion.\n\n01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:38.360\nLike, like, how come there's so many more stamp collectors that are aged 40 in 2030?\n\n01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:42.920\nWell, because it traces back to this panic people had that they were missing out on the\n\n01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.520\nsmaller things in life.\n\n01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.840\nAll these CrossFit gyms, like every day I've seen in one of those.\n\n01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.760\nThat's probably the response.\n\n01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.760\nYeah.\n\n01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.360\nI mean, there seems, I don't know, the people I know that go to gyms say that the drop off\n\n01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.640\nthat happens at the beginning of the year hasn't really happened so far, which is interesting.\n\n01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.640\nI don't know.\n\n01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.640\nDo you want to meet my black friend that has your last name?\n\n01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.640\nOh yeah.\n\n01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.640\nI might know him.\n\n01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640\nOh yeah.\n\n01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.640\nDid you, did you meet him before the show?\n\n01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:12.560\nNo, I just, you know, we, you guys all know each other because you know, it's funny.\n\n01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.560\nYou know, it's shitty.\n\n01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560\nOkay.\n\n01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.760\nI'm going to say this because like we don't all black people don't, but it's hard because\n\n01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.400\nlike in Hollywood, I'm learning like I have met.\n\n01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:27.360\nI'm going to say probably 60% well in Hollywood, and I haven't even been doing it that long.\n\n01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.000\nI mean, just because there's not that many.\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.560\nAnd so it's one of those things where I'm like, yeah, I do know that person and I don't want\n\n01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.360\nto tell you that because you're asking me for that.\n\n01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.680\nI have that conversation constantly now because I'm not all, it's, it's almost like a social\n\n01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.680\ncustomer.\n\n01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:47.160\nI'm not allowed to, I have to, I go like, oh, Asian person, do you know Randall Park?\n\n01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.920\nAnd they're like, of course I know Randall Park.\n\n01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.920\nI figured you did, but I'm not allowed to.\n\n01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:51.920\nRight.\n\n01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.920\nAll right.\n\n01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.760\nWell, let's bring up DeMorge Brown.\n\n01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:09.640\nNo relation to the M.O.R.G.E.\n\n01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:26.240\nDeMorge Brown, sitting down to the M.O.R.G.E., sitting, that was me, DeMorge, that was great.\n\n01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.240\nThe blood is in the water.\n\n01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.200\nKeep your freestyles short, like little, little punctuations and you'll, you'll like, you'll\n\n01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.200\nget through them.\n\n01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.200\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.200\nI'm all right.\n\n01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.200\nWhat the?\n\n01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.200\nYeah.\n\n01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.320\nWhat else was Mayville like?\n\n01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.320\nAnything new?\n\n01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.520\nUh, not a single, just working, working, working, working, working.\n\n01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.320\nWe don't know each other, by the way.\n\n01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.320\nOkay.\n\n01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.320\nWe don't know each other.\n\n01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.320\nDo you?\n\n01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.320\nBut now we do, so.\n\n01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320\nYeah.\n\n01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.320\nUh-oh.\n\n01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.320\nDo you want to, do you want to share any of your work?\n\n01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:58.400\nUh, my stuff, personally, I'm just still writing really weird sort of shorts.\n\n01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.600\nUm, it's a weird thing where it's like Fela Kuti at a, uh, children's show, and it's\n\n01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.040\na cold open of the cold, uh, of the show, so it's a puppet in Fela Kuti.\n\n01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.360\nSo that's a thing.\n\n01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.360\nSomething you're writing on spec?\n\n01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.360\nUh, no, no.\n\n01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360\nIt's just my thing.\n\n01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:17.520\nIt's just part of my sort of ongoing, ongoing sort of realm of shorts that are ideas I want\n\n01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.880\nto see executed that nobody ever.\n\n01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.440\nDo you write every day?\n\n01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.520\nDo you get up at like a certain, uh, and get right to it or?\n\n01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:29.120\nUh, it's, every day is different for me, so like, uh, but at some point every day I sit\n\n01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.760\ndown and, uh, write in some form.\n\n01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.200\nI mean, yeah, absolutely.\n\n01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.200\nMe too.\n\n01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.200\nEvery day.\n\n01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.200\nEvery day.\n\n01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.200\nStephen King.\n\n01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.280\nI, that's what they call me.\n\n01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.320\nYou know that motherfucker writes every day.\n\n01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.320\nI read on writing, that's why I know.\n\n01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.320\nSomebody told me something.\n\n01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:53.080\nI think it was, I think it was my partner in my other podcast, uh, uh, uh, Jessica Gow.\n\n01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.880\nShe quoted something from that book that I thought was really profound and that I immediately\n\n01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:02.540\nforgot, but it sounds like that's, that's the first time I've heard somebody like,\n\n01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:06.680\nuh, like, yeah, Stephen King's on writing sounds like an inspirational book.\n\n01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.020\noperational, you know, he almost died. I didn't know that. Yeah.\n\n01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.020\nIt's crazy. I\n\n01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:16.080\nI had a girlfriend in Milwaukee who\n\n01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:21.180\nBragged to me that she went out to his place one time and stole one of his gargoyles\n\n01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:26.060\nAnd I thought to this day like when I see him on Twitter after I feel like should I tell him?\n\n01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:30.700\nBecause it's like the world changed like back in Milwaukee in the 90s\n\n01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.220\nIt was like ha Stephen King\n\n01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:38.180\nIt's a guy's names on a book on your bookshelf and you stole his gargoyle and that is like the world just like Tesseracted\n\n01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:43.980\nAnd and now he's just there if I mentioned him he might go I like Rick and Morty. I'm like my girlfriend still your gargoyle\n\n01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:52.040\nYou should tell him you gotta tell I don't know it's it's not my piece to make though it is I didn't do anything\n\n01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:56.200\nWhat if you're telling him right now ladies and gentlemen? I\n\n01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.240\nLove Rick and Morty\n\n01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:08.640\nDo you read a lot of fiction? Do you I do I've I have gone back to reading a lot of fiction because I find that\n\n01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.880\nwriting is much easier for me when I'm reading something like I\n\n01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.920\nEven like a couple months ago\n\n01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:20.160\nI was just having a hard time like getting words down and I realized I hadn't read a book in like a month or something like that\n\n01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.680\nSo I have and I'm not working technically so I got a lot of time\n\n01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:28.280\nI used to read mostly nonfiction though, but I'm back to fiction. So I\n\n01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:34.480\nI don't read anything. Yeah, I can't even read if I I can't it's like it's that Twitter thing\n\n01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:39.080\nI can't read anything longer than a bumper sticker anymore like my brain. Oh my god\n\n01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.040\nThat's bumpy burger executives are\n\n01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:55.160\nHappened we'll find out what's going on. What happened? We're gonna conduct the thorough internal review. Did anybody see what happened? I\n\n01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.640\nthink it was\n\n01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.080\nYeah\n\n01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.240\nHmm fucking gel clips\n\n01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.160\nWell, the heavier things are mounted very securely. Okay, um\n\n01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:10.800\nTo mortgage are you or how are you emotionally and spiritually and I'm good. I'm good\n\n01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:19.440\nExhausted but put a lot of pressure on myself this year to kind of like crack something open and make something happen in this town, but I\n\n01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.960\nCan I help it anyway? I\n\n01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:29.820\nI suppose I mean, it's your choice. Well, I don't know like yeah, I don't I don't know the answer either\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.240\nYeah, yeah, yeah, no, I just I mean all you can do is be who you are and do what you're doing\n\n01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:43.560\nWhat else you're supposed to do, you know, yeah, that's that was either the royal you like like everybody can either condense it\n\n01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.560\nOr that was that you do you Harmon?\n\n01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.080\nI don't have\n\n01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.160\nI don't know. I don't know if you saw the headlines but Rick and Morty's and limbo\n\n01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:01.960\nUm, I didn't see the headlines. What do they say in limbo? It's not in limbo. It's there where is a negotiator?\n\n01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.960\nNegotiating a contract and I so I still negotiating\n\n01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:10.280\nI said to the five thousandth kid that tweeted me. Hey, you fat lazy alcoholics stop\n\n01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:16.000\nBeing so slow writing the scripts like because they're 15 and they I understand that they don't know how TV works\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.040\nI just don't understand why they're so horrible. Why are they so mean?\n\n01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:27.080\nWhy are they so there's not you can't when when community fans would go? I'm upset right now because\n\n01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.460\nAnnie kissed Jeff instead of bread. I would go\n\n01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:37.120\nFirst of all, you're you're crazy because you're upset with me and their fictional characters\n\n01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:41.720\nBut second of all, that's how I feel about TV to thank you for the biggest compliment in the world\n\n01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:48.120\nWhich is total immersion in my narrative and I get it. I understand the the compliment on this. I get it\n\n01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.640\nThese kids that are like like\n\n01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.800\nI ain't a cupcake today and they're like\n\n01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.840\nWhy don't you fucking stop eating cupcakes and write the fucking show you piece of shit and it's like what?\n\n01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:06.880\nWe skipped the part where you like it even like it's crazy. Clearly you do or is there a\n\n01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.920\nworld\n\n01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.600\nWhere?\n\n01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.600\nThat would work\n\n01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:19.560\nLike a kid would go will you stop eating cupcakes and you'd write the script and you read\n\n01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.480\nNo, it's just so even though it hasn't been ordered by the network\n\n01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.760\nWhich is why now the trades because now I yelled at a 15 year old like it hasn't been ordered\n\n01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.520\nAnd then so now it's like I just I can see on this\n\n01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:36.560\nthe absolute vodka sponsored sidebars of like the websites where I've tried to trying to like\n\n01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:43.720\nProcrast and it's like I just I see like my name and I see Rick and Morty thumbnails. I'm like, ah, you did it again\n\n01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.520\nand but but like\n\n01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:54.760\nYeah, is there a universe where a kid saying that would make me write a season of Rick and Morty by myself\n\n01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:01.520\nWithout getting together with Justin. Oh Justin. Okay, Justin. I'm gonna. I'm just you know what this is taking so long\n\n01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.400\nI'm gonna just start writing the show because you're gonna have to write it. Anyway, right exactly\n\n01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:09.720\nAnd eventually we'll still have a head start fade in Rick's like I love inventing stuff\n\n01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.380\nAnd I was like like like yeah, no, I don't I don't see\n\n01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.400\nIf there was a world where that was going to happen\n\n01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:22.160\nI think maybe the kid would be saying something along the lines of I have Lou Gehrig's disease\n\n01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:27.520\nAnd I'd love to see a script of Rick and Morty before I die and obviously that's not good\n\n01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.200\nI'm not gonna get to see the show\n\n01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.920\nMaybe not hey you piece of shit\n\n01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:37.760\nYour fat this is why your wife left you like like they dig into my personal life\n\n01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:45.240\nYeah, and I'm like like you don't know how TV works and you don't know what this is good\n\n01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.680\nYou're 15\n\n01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:52.480\nSo you're supposed to be dumb, but you're not supposed to have this hubris. This is dangerous\n\n01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.840\nI guess this is what all old people have said about young people forever internet people are scary though\n\n01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:02.840\nWe used to get crazy emails at Jezebel like every day. It was like well Jezebel terrified me like it's yeah\n\n01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.840\nI mean like I can't imagine the\n\n01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.360\nPeople are very bold. That's cuz you know, you got to like offer to meet them\n\n01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:14.880\nSpencer's Spencer's way of putting it which I thought was very accurate because it kind of like it's like the internet has stripped\n\n01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:20.740\nShame from the species and that has resulted in amazing things like\n\n01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:28.460\na foot that and evil things like it has you you can now I did focus and comfort groups for like people with leprosy and\n\n01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:37.260\nStuff like very serious things like you know that people have had to live in isolation from and had terrible stigma\n\n01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:45.780\nHow could you successfully have raised your consciousness without the internet when the very thing about it that that is used to oppress is that is\n\n01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.100\nThat there's not strengthened numbers\n\n01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:51.660\nThere's not like you know, you're not gonna have a million transgender march and probably people will yell at me for that\n\n01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:58.580\nBut but but I just I mean that in a in a way of saying like like we shouldn't have to wait for that and like like it's like\n\n01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:03.460\nIt's that's how amazing the internet is is that we can go. Oh, there's there's it doesn't matter\n\n01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:08.880\nIt doesn't it doesn't have to be mob rule or anything, but it's like and then the fucking exact same thing happened with\n\n01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.140\nNazis, they're just like, oh, yeah, yeah, no shame like like\n\n01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:17.460\nNo, no, yeah, like totally like I shame it. There's also like an like an invitation to\n\n01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.220\nto this myth that like that your\n\n01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:24.900\nYour every thought is an opinion and every opinion\n\n01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:29.420\nMatters and should be because there's always a cursor. It just it became free\n\n01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:34.100\nit went from being this expensive technology that Gutenberg developed on the side of cocoon and\n\n01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:41.180\nAnd my references are getting so older than the first Gutenberg\n\n01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:49.700\nLike like yeah, it was it was like lasers to have to print a newspaper or leave a comment on something and then it became like\n\n01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:53.700\nAnything to say in this Farmville move. Yeah\n\n01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:57.700\nPeople well, there you go. It's now it's in Farmville font\n\n01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:05.340\nRemember back in the comic book days where people would snail mail the shit that you get comments on now\n\n01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:10.260\nLike we would get in Milwaukee. Somebody went. Hmm. I'm gonna write\n\n01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.620\nI was wondering why I would take pen to paper under such circumstances\n\n01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:19.660\nHowever, it's me to make a bit of an introduction. First of all a few words about myself\n\n01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:26.940\nI am a what they call a militant virgin. I am proud to say your comic book has given me very much guidance through this\n\n01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:30.740\nHowever, I object to the principles at hand. No second of all in regards to issue three\n\n01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:34.820\nYeah, and they would just it would have us you'd have to put a stamp on it walk to the mill\n\n01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:39.220\nThat person had to have to need to put cardio into their fucking parasitism\n\n01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:47.660\nThere's an entitlement thing too because I find that if like if I tweet something and then someone responds back with some bullshit\n\n01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:52.060\nAnd I'm like, I wasn't asking you a fucking question and they're like wasn't want to tweet it\n\n01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:56.580\nI'm like just because I tweet something is not an invitation for your dumbass opinions\n\n01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:01.060\nAnd they think that just putting anything out there is like now I get to respond to it\n\n01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:07.420\nAnd it's you like I have the right to and you have to respond to me and if you didn't want people to like\n\n01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:12.420\nComment you about it. You shouldn't have said it and it's like nobody's talking to you. Yeah, it's not a conversation\n\n01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.260\nI'm not having conversation with any of you people\n\n01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.900\nYeah\n\n01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:25.260\nI mean like every once in a while and this is a fun way to use Twitter every once in a while I'll go like hey\n\n01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:30.640\nI need shorts, you know like anybody got any or I found a drone in my yard\n\n01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.980\nDoes anyone know who's it is and like the internet snaps as it's like, yeah\n\n01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:40.500\nThere's very specific points when as a primate you could recognize when someone wants information from you and it if we keep\n\n01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.700\nDefining it as when a cursor is blinking underneath what they're saying. We're going to die\n\n01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:49.660\nRight well, that's the problem is because that our behavior in is shaped by\n\n01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:55.980\nTechnology and the options it kind of conveys because it's like we can obviously do a million things\n\n01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:02.540\nBut internet's and websites they present a number of options and so they limit it and so you're not thinking oh\n\n01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:07.780\nCommenting is not something I have to worry about but then it gives you an option\n\n01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.180\nIt's like would you like to comment?\n\n01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:11.740\nThis is something you should consider doing and it's like well\n\n01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:15.980\nNo, you should have considered commenting every time you see a box that says comment that would be absurd\n\n01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.980\nWell, I don't know if they ever\n\n01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:25.200\nLike like I noticed that the people they're writing for online publications and stuff they\n\n01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:32.700\nThey started having to put in there like TV reviews and stuff like like they they they have to end their paragraph with like\n\n01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.020\nDid you think?\n\n01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.020\nYeah\n\n01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:48.660\nNo, don't don't tell them they need to be ashamed. Yeah, I did not I did not like the comments. I know I I\n\n01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.660\nLike the just any benefit\n\n01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:57.140\nI mean it was nice when people like stuff and sometimes people gave you corrections and sometimes it was helpful\n\n01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:03.360\nbut like it the negative far outweighed any of the positive and like it was always this thing of like\n\n01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:10.760\nprofessionalism like if we if they would like people would comment stuff on on articles and they'd be just smart asses and\n\n01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:16.040\nThen we would respond back like smart asses because you're right came in being a dick and like I can be a dick, too\n\n01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.520\nAnd then they're like well, this is really unprofessional\n\n01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.400\nRight, it's like you just call like you just call me stupid also\n\n01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.280\nI don't work for or with you and this is not a service\n\n01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.200\nSo there's no professionalism\n\n01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:34.240\nI had you and I because we're like I it's me and my co-workers and I'm not providing a service to you\n\n01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:40.960\nWe're just putting the shit out there and you're choosing to read it and like I just if we could have every day\n\n01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:45.640\nI would ask our editor like it became a joke or as like can we can we get rid of the comments today?\n\n01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:53.040\nNo, if we get rid of the comment section, then we're competing with websites that have comment sections and there's a certain I don't know\n\n01:16:53.040 --> 01:17:00.360\nWho the fuck these people are but there's there a sizable percentage of the audience that like\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.200\nThey like to comment\n\n01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.640\nYeah, so if Jezebel removes their comment section and Hezebel doesn't Hezebel\n\n01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:14.520\nI guess gets that 10% 20% of readers and it's so we're terrified, but then and I just\n\n01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.120\nMan, I mean this is how like\n\n01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:29.120\nJournalism seeing the internet and going what do we do is is is is the whole reason why we're in everything now because instead of going\n\n01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.120\nwe need to double down on\n\n01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:41.120\nJournalistic standards and like basically elitism because I'm sure we sound like elitist right now to somebody who's like I leave a lot of comments\n\n01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.120\nWhat makes you so better aren't you?\n\n01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:49.440\nDoesn't isn't Kara's job to comment on society and then I leave a comment under her comment on culture and like now\n\n01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.320\nI'm an asshole because I'm just a plebe. Well, I\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.920\nGuess part of me wants to just go. Yeah, let's end that argument\n\n01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:03.880\nYou are a plebe like you're you're you're fucking thought process is horrible like you didn't you didn't want to spend any more than the three\n\n01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.520\nHours it took you to write these two paragraphs about like how she's technically being unfair\n\n01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:16.440\nIt's like you're you're not you don't you don't really hurt as much for this as as as the person you're commenting on does so\n\n01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.440\nYeah, elitism, I guess\n\n01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.120\nBut like they're doing work\n\n01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:28.240\nYou commenting isn't like it. It wasn't it's not like it just came to mind. It's like I wrote something\n\n01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.840\nI spent time on it someone else read it. It was checked like I was doing I was doing something\n\n01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:39.560\nYeah, but even but you and I agree that even on Twitter where we're not doing work if I'm just like hey\n\n01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.560\nI don't like I don't like banana splits\n\n01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.680\nHere's the here's the here's the replies I enjoyed\n\n01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.840\na\n\n01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:56.160\nSmart fun person saying like banana splits are the are the blank of blank like like maybe it's a swing and a miss\n\n01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:02.280\nBut it's like they tried and it's like they're they're yes, ending. They're go there. You know, they're not here's the ones I don't like\n\n01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.280\nUh\n\n01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.520\nThey're they're technically not banana splits. That's a fallacy or whatever the file\n\n01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:16.800\nI'm gonna split at the other place or like or like just repeating the joke like like I can't give an example of that because bananas\n\n01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.080\nI don't like banana splits isn't a joke\n\n01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:24.080\nBut but like they were they just like repeat it and it's like it makes you wonder if like they knew\n\n01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.760\nLike so, what do you think I am? Do you think I'm just a guy just like making noise?\n\n01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:32.880\nIt's a year and now you're making it just it did I just I and I put a flow chart\n\n01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.880\nI pinned it to my Twitter profile. I\n\n01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.720\nGraffted out where you can walk through it if you read a tweet\n\n01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:47.040\nYou can walk through the flow chart when deciding whether or not you should reply and it's it's pretty it's pretty well thought out\n\n01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:50.720\nIf I give if I do say so myself, how long did it take you to make the flow chart?\n\n01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.860\nI'm not gonna comment on that until I turn the script in\n\n01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:58.300\nThe but it's like and then I posted it. I was like, there we go\n\n01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:03.340\nSo, you know, that's good then then like I don't have to get mad at people anymore because I can even if anything\n\n01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.140\nI can just reprint the flow chart\n\n01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:07.620\neverybody looked at the flow chart and because I they like\n\n01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.260\n80% of the people were like\n\n01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.900\nha oh\n\n01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.980\nHow do you know when you finish or?\n\n01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:18.500\nLike they were like they thought it was a board game or\n\n01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:23.420\nThey thought it was like a flow chart of whether or not I will respond to their tweet\n\n01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:26.700\nThis is this is so there used to be in my opinion\n\n01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:32.420\nThere used to be a gear of hesitation in that so shame see something\n\n01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:39.980\nYeah, shame or what I like I don't but there's a fear of being expelled from the fig tree of monkeys because you suck\n\n01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.620\nfear of that\n\n01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:45.260\nReflex and the opinion are not the same thing\n\n01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:48.660\nso you have a reflexive action or response to something and\n\n01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:55.060\nYour first was you're there used to be a check that sort of said alright. Let me just be ashamed\n\n01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.860\nFor just a second away. Let this have let this opinion form\n\n01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:03.260\nLet me think about what and then if it if it became something that you had solidified\n\n01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.980\nYou could you would post that if it was if there was enough base\n\n01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:10.940\nBut now overcome the shame acid you had a milkshake. Yeah, that's sort of gag reflex is gone\n\n01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:13.580\nAnd now people just kind of go out like that right away\n\n01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:20.100\nYeah, here's something that I is in my head and and it's like I and and and and you could never again\n\n01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:26.100\nYou can't say to the person like well, you don't even know how to spell and you're like yelling at me\n\n01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:32.100\nThat's the long gone. We're in the middle of an anti-intellectual revolution. The president is like I\n\n01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:39.380\nSpells cats dogs people don't read anything also is something I've learned because I would get\n\n01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:44.460\nComments and it's like they're commenting on something. I'm like it is literally in the thing\n\n01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:48.380\nI just wrote right you made it halfway through and then you got pissy\n\n01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.380\nAnd then you went in and left a comment\n\n01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:55.500\nAnd if you would just finished reading the fucking article the exact thing question that you have was answered\n\n01:21:55.500 --> 01:22:01.100\nAnd I mean even with Twitter, I feel like people like I'll get responses. I'm like, are you understanding what I just said\n\n01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:04.260\nI don't think you're understanding this or you're not reading this clearly\n\n01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:10.620\nPeople and that irony is that underneath it all people just want to be heard and connect but they can't then turn that into empathy and go\n\n01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:17.660\nOh, I guess that's how everyone feels so maybe don't like go into this YouTube video of someone's daughter doing ballet and go\n\n01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:22.900\nShe looks a little fat like like like like because the reason you're saying that is that's your pirouette\n\n01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:30.380\nLike that's you wanting praise on a YouTube video from your dad that doesn't exist and it's like it's insane that you can't\n\n01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:37.340\nIt like we're anyways, well, let's do this to save save save save you guys from my maelstrom\n\n01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:42.140\nWhat's what's good about the modern world? What's what do we like about it?\n\n01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:44.860\nUsed to be worse in some ways\n\n01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:50.020\nYeah, you see those those beer bottles that the mountain turns blue if it's cold\n\n01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.940\nHoly shit\n\n01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:59.740\nThat's the perfect temperature to drink beer what is really my therapist always makes me do this like what's good\n\n01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:04.100\nWhat's good? What is good? Even if it's just in your personal life like oh, well, you're you're easy\n\n01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:08.340\nYou're on a fucking streak. That's good. You don't even give a shit about us\n\n01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:12.700\nYou just think you're like I wonder if I get a parking space next\n\n01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:21.420\nNo, I mean, it's I think I have to remember that at least\n\n01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:28.940\nFor a black person. It's better to be alive anytime in the future than in the past, right?\n\n01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:37.220\nI'm most likely so it's better now than to 20 years ago. So I guess there's that\n\n01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:45.820\nYeah, like it it's yeah, yeah, it's hard not to be positive about it because\n\n01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:51.980\nYou can't be nostalgic about it. No, still not great. Yeah. No, but I it's like I would rather be alive\n\n01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:55.220\nNow then 60 years ago\n\n01:23:55.220 --> 01:24:00.180\nbut I think it went along those lines one of the things is that the representations of\n\n01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:05.460\nWhat we see are more specific now because you can't\n\n01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:12.500\nHide behind this idea that oh people only want to see this type of family on TV or that kind of thing\n\n01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.260\nSo you're talking about the huckstables and that was for me\n\n01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:17.620\nThat was like one of the first times that I saw situations\n\n01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:21.940\nThat were reflective of my own life and people would come up and say well\n\n01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:28.620\nIt's not it's not a real family or it's not of this or it's not of that but I know plenty of families through my parents and through my\n\n01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:34.340\nYou know other just circles where black lawyer black doctor black, whatever black black reels or black, whatever\n\n01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:42.700\nWho had friends and had the best parts for me of the cost which was would be at the end when the guest star would have been a\n\n01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:49.980\nA a musician of amazing note, but that I didn't know\n\n01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:53.660\nI didn't know who Betty Carter was until that episode where she came in it\n\n01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:58.220\nThey give her ten minutes at the end of the show to sing a song as part of the narrative that kind of stuff\n\n01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:01.540\nAnd so for me as a kid I go I don't know who that is but that song is amazing\n\n01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:05.260\nWait for the credits to roll write the name down go to the library right after that\n\n01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:13.260\nRealize who this woman is and and how amazing she was and that show just had constantly had that kind of stuff\n\n01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.220\nAnd then so I think that now what's happening is\n\n01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.500\nSo much stuff is happening so much\n\n01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:24.660\nfaster and you have kids whose vision of the world is is\n\n01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:34.940\nSeveral increments faster than the people who are trying to create entertainment for them because of it now people are trying to match up with\n\n01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.940\nthese kids in the way that they see the world and\n\n01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:42.540\nThe internet is one way that you see that I mean you have to kind of if we can last\n\n01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:47.620\nAnother 30 years we have we are living through a tipping point where the syndrome\n\n01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:51.820\nThat we've been grappling with will will have been overcome\n\n01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:58.940\nRight like we can all agree on that it's just but now it's a question ironically if we if we are here in 30 years\n\n01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:00.940\nIf we could have what we have today plus\n\n01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.580\nnow now that we got\n\n01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:09.380\nNow that we got a Shonda and then therefore are gonna have the 10 Shonda imitators and the\n\n01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:11.540\n500 like Shonda\n\n01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:15.900\nInspire ease and and the and the blah blah blah like not just confining it to that topic\n\n01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:21.860\nBut keeping it on theme for this episode, but like like it that plus 20 years equals boom\n\n01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:23.860\nI think we're done and\n\n01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:31.380\nBut but the it's is that why so we're it's like we're having a fever because we're like we're like it's getting too close to that\n\n01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:34.060\nIt's I like like I don't I don't like all this talk about\n\n01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:39.220\nLike I don't I keep hearing that I'm white and I just don't like it and it's like making me uncomfortable\n\n01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:44.500\nLike I'd never heard that before it's like what do you mean? I'm bad. I don't know what that means like I've\n\n01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.220\nHaven't been called white outside of like a Richard Pryor album in like\n\n01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:55.500\nAnd and like so like we're then it's America is just like it's having this seismic fucking conniption fit\n\n01:26:55.900 --> 01:27:00.700\nPrecisely because things because we're in the bubble right now because things are almost there\n\n01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.700\nYou we're in a place now where you can't\n\n01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:07.220\nIt's a lot harder to walk around and go like I don't know what that is or I don't know what that term is\n\n01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:09.700\nSo everything is changing so fast and they just throw in these words\n\n01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:15.940\nWell, you now have to learn the vocabulary people are learning that there is a place for themselves and in this world\n\n01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:21.900\nAnd they're choosing their own definitions and then they're forcing you to learn the label because what I'm excited about which I don't think other white\n\n01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:30.300\nPeople understand about as far as changing times under our feet is that if you if it feels like a conveyor belt is making you go like this\n\n01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:35.140\nLike yeah, your first instinct is something's going wrong. Stop it from happening\n\n01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:39.820\nBut much like with mp3 technology or anything else that is just gonna happen\n\n01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:47.860\nThis second thing that happens is you now have an unprecedented license to be even more relaxed than you've ever been\n\n01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:54.100\nLike you can now like pretty soon if this nightmare that you're worried about where white people are somehow\n\n01:27:54.100 --> 01:28:02.300\nJust other people like like like or and that they're always wrong or there was like you can now be you could just go like\n\n01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:07.300\nYeah, I don't know like like which is like a fun. I like like I don't know what I'm doing\n\n01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:09.300\nI don't know. Is that what you call that?\n\n01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:12.620\nform of of of of\n\n01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:18.900\nSocial custom I certainly wasn't trying to offend anybody. I don't know what the fuck is going on. I'm just white, right?\n\n01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:24.700\nI'm fucking idiot like isn't that a luxury? Isn't that fun? Like that's like being in a cruise ship. Excuse me\n\n01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:29.500\nWhere's the bathroom? I just took a shit over the rail. I don't know you tell me I'm just here\n\n01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:33.980\nI'm just old and dying on a boat. I guess I don't know why I'm like looking at you guys like right, right?\n\n01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:37.460\nIt's like I have the wrong panel for this. I just have like business as usual\n\n01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:45.580\nI think you know what I do think though. I think I think white people just also maybe need to relax a little bit\n\n01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:51.220\nLike it'll be fine. Do we get to now? It'll be fine. It's like not invited to the conversation\n\n01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:55.580\nI don't have to care about Black Panther. Isn't that isn't that fun? Yeah, it's fine\n\n01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:00.700\nYou don't have to you can't you can't you can't make or break a Marvel movie with your Rotten Tomatoes review\n\n01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:05.460\nIsn't isn't that nice? You can take the day off. You don't have to just care\n\n01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:07.900\nas I guess I'm flaunting my\n\n01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.380\nmy my advantage of\n\n01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:16.340\nListening to Jessica gow for for however many episodes have been doing that show because I guess it's like that\n\n01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:20.620\nThat had to really be drilled into me because I was like like we're talking about the Confederate thing and I was like\n\n01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:25.220\nI'm still like what about ink and like like yeah, but we haven't seen the show or it's like isn't this a slippery slope?\n\n01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:33.060\nI don't get it and and and but and then at some point I like like I had like this kind of fit of like since we were like\n\n01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:35.060\nThis disconnect and I was like, yeah, but Jessica\n\n01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:40.020\nI feel like I feel like I'm Optimus Prime and all the Autobots are coming to me and saying like you're\n\n01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:43.680\nOptimus Prime and you're in charge, but we hate you for being in charge and we\n\n01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:48.660\nWe what we want you to stop doing things, but we want you to start doing things different all this stuff\n\n01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:50.420\nAnd she's like no one said you were Optimus Prime\n\n01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:57.740\nIt turned into this like really weird like moment where I was like wait, so I don't have to have an opinion about\n\n01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.700\nConfederate yeah, and she's like no\n\n01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:07.580\nYour opinion about it.

I love french fries. Do you like bumpy burger more than McDonald's?\n\n01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:53.260\nYeah, because I drew a logo for it and\n\n01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:56.520\nI want a competition. Hmm. Oh\n\n01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:03.980\nHow come they didn't put it on a billboard outside of town they they didn't put it on a billboard, but they put it on their menu\n\n01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:11.340\nOh, that's pretty cool. That is cool. Yeah, that was worth it. Wasn't it? Yeah, and we still got a minute left\n\n01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:17.260\nDid we really talk for two hours? No, I just mean to have covered two minutes of bumpy burgers\n\n01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.860\nOh, I\n\n01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:22.100\nMean no one said the podcast has to be two hours. Also. What's I know?\n\n01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:27.860\nNo, no one ever is as ever said that and most people are like stop making the podcast two hours\n\n01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:30.100\nReally? You read that stuff. Yeah, I'm at work\n\n01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:34.260\nI'm already at work and I want to press I got a press pause.

It seems like he wants to kill himself. It seems like every time I see Spencer\n\n01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:51.540\nHe's gonna kill himself. I don't know why Spencer hates himself so much and everything he does\n\n01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:56.060\nSo maybe that also happens because the show goes on so long\n\n01:32:56.460 --> 01:33:00.860\nMust be nice to be able to read about yourself on the internet without killing yourself. Oh, it's great\n\n01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:04.100\nI'm I I've yeah, it's great.

I had and in college\n\n01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:19.320\nThat's we've never had you do a character on this show like your character work is amazing. Oh, thanks, man\n\n01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:23.200\nWell, I didn't you know, what's the space and shadow very Sanders? Oh, yeah\n\n01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:30.120\nI mean you yeah, like yeah, it's like you immerse yourself into the silliest shit and then make this it's like it's the best\n\n01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:36.800\nThat's the best part about it. Yeah, just sort of finding connections to things and then connecting the gaps and just sort of disappearing and you know\n\n01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.000\nComing out the other end\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000\nIt's like the fail-a-cootie thing is just\n\n01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:48.640\nBecause I was hanging out with Kyle and he said I want to open the next episode of Gumbel with this song and it\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.040\nWas just fail-a talking and the music of his voice\n\n01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:58.960\nI was like, that's pretty close to mine. I bet you I could do that and then he counts off the song and he just goes one two three five\n\n01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.920\nAnd I was like, that's that's a five-second impression. That's perfect\n\n01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:04.400\nIf you just did that and walked away\n\n01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:11.040\nso that whole premise of that thing is like what how little can I do but then also physically I'm gonna cut a\n\n01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.800\ncrazy widow's peak in my hair and\n\n01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:19.600\nAnd for one day just have this weird fail-a-cootie haircut, you know\n\n01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.120\nJust to set up a joke is kind of like that\n\n01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:27.240\nBut we can't order it up like a fry cook we can't go to more than you should do a crazy character for Harmontown\n\n01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.960\nYou should come on next time. We won't we won't introduce you\n\n01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:36.040\nYou'll just or we'll introduce you as a man is just an alternate thing like you you'll just come up as some like\n\n01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:42.640\nCharacter and do something and walk off. Yeah, just don't introduce me as to more to introduce me as the character hell\n\n01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.360\nYeah, are you gonna do it? So you're gonna go in the kitchen and cook something up and let us know when you want to do that\n\n01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:50.960\nAnd then I'll just yeah, yeah, let's do that. Okay, great. Wow. This has been a productive\n\n01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:57.320\nI mean I do that all the time this would do with characters like one-on-one even what I'll do is like if I if the character's ready in a way\n\n01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:04.240\nThen I'll just kind of in the week of the best thing is to go to food courts and malls as the character and just kind of hang out\n\n01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.200\nAnd just do Monday and shit like order food and kind of be\n\n01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:13.000\nNot so much to see how people react but see how it feels to be reacted to\n\n01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:19.520\nBy real people because then suddenly you've got this inner thing that's that's building and it's you think less about what's on the outside\n\n01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.520\nMore about the insides\n\n01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:23.240\nAll right\n\n01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:25.240\nDan do you have anything to plug?\n\n01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:28.080\nYeah, watch for my butt\n\n01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:34.720\nHell, yeah, I have to plug my butt.

That's no\n\n01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:44.400\nNo, no, you had you have some of the you know why he's sorry is because he he he lost just\n\n01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:50.080\nStrategic ground it's not because he actually has remorse or empathy, right? He's making he was like, oh shit\n\n01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:56.720\nI'm the bad guy now. I better backpedal. That's a good feeling. Yeah. Yes.

So watch for that coming up soon. Yeah\n\n01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:49.720\nNow that Rick and Morty's in limbo, it's like faster upon us. All right, well\n\n01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.960\nAnyone have a question for me?\n\n01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:00.280\nSpencer is there anything you'd like to plug? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. That's a good all man\n\n01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:02.280\nIt's so interesting you ask. I guess I gotta think about that\n\n01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:07.800\nYou guys hear about these these Chinese murder vans\n\n01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:18.840\nThey're vans in China, isn't that just racist slang for ambulance? No, we we do do this every time\n\n01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:22.680\nThis is great. It's my favorite. This is becoming or like a real running gag\n\n01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:28.160\nNo, but they're these man these vans that they'll they'll pick you up and they'll kill you and put in theory\n\n01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:34.560\nThey're in some cases. They've they've linked to selling and transmitting your organs. So\n\n01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.080\nWatch out for that. Yeah, also watch out for\n\n01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:41.160\nIf you have a student protest\n\n01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:47.560\nIn a giant square in the center of your town like they just turn off the cameras and roll all of you over with steamrollers and\n\n01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:53.600\nThere's that's another thing to keep your eye out for right tenements. That really happened. Yeah, they fucking\n\n01:44:53.600 --> 01:45:01.920\nThose people are spaghetti those people are spaghetti by the by by numbers that would shock by numbers\n\n01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:08.640\nYeah, Tiananmen Square happen and notice the yeah, it's like they were like, well, look at the guy for the tank\n\n01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:11.880\nI can't tell if you're being serious and then they and then and then they just\n\n01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:18.160\nThey just fucking soylent greened people into fucking like yeah, they killed everybody\n\n01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:21.200\nThey killed everybody\n\n01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:28.360\nEveryone this is what happens in autocracies. This is why we shouldn't like think it's cool to fucking like Russia\n\n01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:32.320\nThey kill gay people in journalists like they they like like China is a fucking\n\n01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:39.160\nYeah, like you can't like like can I just quickly on a soapbox look people people who are like, oh man\n\n01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:43.760\nYou shouldn't be worried about Russia. It's like look read about Russia. It's really bad\n\n01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:48.840\nThey definitely are putting gay people into camps. It's not about virtue signaling. It's about pragmatism\n\n01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:56.480\nIf you're into game theory you and you're fucking like you should be scared of the idea of not having checks and balances and three branches of government\n\n01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:02.160\nYou fucking idiot. Yeah, sorry. You think I'm a noble person. I just don't want to die\n\n01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:06.600\nThe part of it is like the way news is reported in this country\n\n01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:12.080\nSo for example when if I can't think of the guys in when the first the hitler not the first but when the spy\n\n01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.720\nWas poisoned radioactively poisoned scurple\n\n01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:22.820\nIt showed up on ABC News the day that it was sort of\n\n01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.560\nProminent as president was this is happening. He's dying. This is going on\n\n01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:30.880\nIf you read the economists, which is not the greatest magazine in the world\n\n01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:36.280\nbut like it is certainly informative and has an opinion about a lot of stuff and it's weekly and\n\n01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.400\nThey he was saying for a year and a half before that they're gonna get me\n\n01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:46.100\nThey're gonna get me and people were listening, but nobody's only thing and when they went in a Chernobyl and like\n\n01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:53.360\nOr when it went in and bought these grills and like gas at that basement and then said well, there were people in there\n\n01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.600\nThey were going to do bad things. So we had to take them all out\n\n01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.000\nThere was a journalist who called bullshit on that and then she got shot in the head\n\n01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.540\nYeah, I'm gonna public courtyard. That's the thing\n\n01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:10.800\nIn a whole 20 shit like 20 things hit like that have happened like this is not we're not just making it up\n\n01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:16.240\nYeah, this shit has happened people are being killed. Yeah, we had a period in American history in the 1920s\n\n01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:20.840\nlike it with the gangland culture was like being celebrated by\n\n01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:29.240\nJournalists and and you know as prohibition all that stuff the thing that really brought that whole thing down wasn't necessarily prohibitions repeal\n\n01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:31.760\nAnd it wasn't Al Capone's taxes being\n\n01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:39.800\nPolice is they killed a journalist like like like somebody wrote something about one of the gangsters that the gangsters didn't like and they just\n\n01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:46.600\nThey just treated him the way they treat mobsters and the fun stopped like we in our most brutal times\n\n01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.880\nLike we have always in this country\n\n01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:58.040\nMaybe only for white people after Scott. It's like we have these fucking like standards of free press isn't about like piousness\n\n01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:03.280\nIt's not about like being holier than now. It's about like goddamn like we gotta you gotta be careful\n\n01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:08.280\nWe are animals. We will murder each other people will get away with what they get away with like you\n\n01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:10.600\nYou don't want to live in this world\n\n01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:15.760\nYou think you want to live in where tough guys are able to do whatever they want and everything seems cool\n\n01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:21.520\nYou're you're you're dumb you're dumb and you're 15 and you're stupid and I hate you read the flow chart\n\n01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:26.960\nThis is something that I figured out with no research.
