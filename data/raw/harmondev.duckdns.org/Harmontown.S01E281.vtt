00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Ladies and gentlemen, coming to you from downtown Burbank, California.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
Let's welcome the Dungeon Master himself, Spencer, Criterion Edition.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
Here he comes.

00:32.000 --> 00:44.000
And now, let's welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.wn.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Thank you.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
Here's the mayor of Harmontown in front of us, Dan Harmon.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
Yo, yo, yo, rapping, rapping, rapping at the top of the show.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Flow.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
All right.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Oh, yeah, that was slick, man.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Holy shit.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
I think that was my most pared down, but therefore admirable freestyling in the history of the show.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Well, Schrab's controlling this episode.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
You're welcome, Sauron.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
He looks like no face.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
He's already doing physical bits.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Hey, I was the one that wanted to do the podcast on video.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
This is you.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, this is you.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
What do you remind me of?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
That's a Sesame Street Muppet, right?

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Those youp, youp, youp, youp, youp, youp, youp guys.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah, I remind you of that.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
In that jacket with the hood over.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Okay.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
In the audio world, what's going on?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Nothing.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm on deadline.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I have to finish the script tonight.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
So I'm going to try to...

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
So we're going to talk double fast to get the show done.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Wait, but don't distract from what's going on in the audio world.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Oh.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Well, that's what I was just switching over to not talking about what Schrab looked like.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Oh, right.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
No, let's talk about what Schrab looks like.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Well, that would be going back into the video world.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, shit.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah, let's not do that.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Let's not go back into the video world.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Well, it's going to be a great show.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
No.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Never in the history of the opening of the show have there ever been more milestones

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
of that in the span of two minutes.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
This is the part where I talk about whatever's going on.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Like I said, I got to finish the script.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Excuse me.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
That was Schrab.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Oh, was it?

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
I covered my mouth, but I didn't think you would hear that.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah, so I'm probably going to, I'll probably have one drink at some point in the show,

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
maybe even three, because I'll start to get nervous that the show is going poorly because

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm bad at doing a show, but I really got to keep my shit together.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
I got to fucking, my therapist told me I am sitting on this script because it is my last

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
chance to be miserable.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
I am this close to happy.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
That's interesting.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
That's interesting.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I'm going through the same thing myself.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I'm having a...

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
What are you using to make yourself miserable?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Doing nothing.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Just postponing stuff, procrastinating.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
Well, Cody right now is at home just, you know, she probably doesn't mind me telling

03:40.000 --> 03:49.000
this because she just finished, she's on hiatus at her regular job and then her other project

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
that she put a lot, you know, she's spent a year of a relationship with this series of

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
scripts and that lifetime has come to an end.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
So she's having that like writer postpartum kind of depression.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
And it's just funny because we're all miserable.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
You're miserable because you don't have a job to do.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Cody's miserable because her job is over.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I'm miserable because I won't stop working.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
And I think it's like the grass is greener, never applied more.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Like we are afraid to deal.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Look, I'm just going to go there because my therapist goes there.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
We're afraid to deal with God.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Like I...

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
And if you're an atheist, I applaud you because that just means you're a scientist and a skeptic

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
and we need those more than ever.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
So when I say God, you just think universe, think chaos.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
But I don't want to pussy foot around about it because I believe in a God that like made my sister retarded

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
and will just give you leukemia because he's bored.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
So I'm like scared of God and like, I don't want to move on to that part of my life where I have to have a relationship

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
with this thing I picture as a big Dan Harmon head in the sky that's like psycho and just does crazy shit.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Just to remind you that he's around.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
I feel like a relationship with God is like owing Polly and good fellas money.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
It's like he's doing you favors and now you're like, what do I have to do and you don't know.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
And I've wanted forever to control that.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I've wanted to do it.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
That's what a writer does or a workaholic does is they say, well, I'm in charge of my bad luck and my good luck.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm in charge of whether or not I'm having a bad day.

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
But it's crazy to do that because I've been doing it for 45 years and what if tomorrow I find a lump or whatever.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
It's like I'm going to be double the sucker.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
I just got to stop pretending like it's hard to write.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
It's just been the biggest scam that I've ever perpetrated on myself and humanity.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
What I do is not difficult and I think I'm ashamed of that.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
I try to make it like it's like art or something and it's like so tired.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
Do you think you're doing that because if it wasn't difficult, it wouldn't be work?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Yeah.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
I think the voice of my brother who I've tried not to mention on this podcast because we don't speak to each other because I mentioned him on the podcast.

06:24.000 --> 06:32.000
I've tried to like I'm not going to talk about my brother, but another way of looking at it is I can do nothing but talk shit about my brother now forever.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
But my brother is five years older than me and growing up.

06:37.000 --> 06:49.000
It's just like this chorus of like he was the guy who was like, yeah, you got mom convinced, but you're a fucking idiot.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
Like my brother knew I was smart, but like you're not special. You're not like like you just you're just a lazy piece of shit.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
You know, and like you're spoiled and you're entitled and mom buys it.

07:00.000 --> 07:08.000
And just because just because I am five years older than you and I smoke weed first and I set fire to the mailbox first and then the driveway first.

07:08.000 --> 07:16.000
And then I poured motor oil in the neighbor's swimming pool first and dropped out of high school first and and hit the house with a baseball bat first.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Just because I'm doing all those things first doesn't mean you're not going to do them.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
And even if you don't do them, it'll only because you had me as an example.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And the truth is you're just a charlatan, you know, you're just like this.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You just you're the you're the baby.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
You like you got you got it all. You got you got you got everything like lined lined up for you.

07:32.000 --> 07:42.000
And and that and that that voice is an important voice because it keeps you especially in these days of like monitoring checking privilege and whatever.

07:42.000 --> 07:51.000
It's like I got I got like this great fucking antenna for that because I'm just always going you little piece of shit in my head over and over again.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Like you're not you're not stuff trying to act like you're fucking talented.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
You're not talented and all this stuff.

07:56.000 --> 08:08.000
And so the idea of me being like like just good or lucky, like, you know, it has to do with my sister too.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
It's like it's just it just fucks with me.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
But it's it's it's been selfish to to like think of it that way.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
It's been it's it's it doesn't make any sense.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
It's not productive at all. Sorry I have my back to you Spencer.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
No, I like suspicion that you're God.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
So I wanted to leave you out of this for a little bit.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Right.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
If you are God, prove it.

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
If I was God, wouldn't it like betray my purposes to prove it at this point?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
He just proved that I don't think so.

08:44.000 --> 08:54.000
I at my therapist said, could you be crazier?

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
That's what she wants.

08:58.000 --> 09:08.000
No, she said she said, could you live with the fact that you weren't like the special one?

09:08.000 --> 09:18.000
You know, like, I mean, like, you know, like, because you you feel like because I've I've had problems where just like, well, you know, you get you get the spotlight.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
And and then all of a sudden your brain goes blank and you can't figure it out or whatever.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
And just like, well, well, maybe don't be tempted by the spotlight.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
You know, you don't have to be the best.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah.

09:32.000 --> 09:41.000
And especially with writing, you know, like writing is and any art is like when you go like, oh, I'm going to make the best thing I've ever done before.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
That's usually failure.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
But if you go, I'm going to make a piece of shit that's just going to be fun to do.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
That's when you do your best work.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah.

09:49.000 --> 10:03.000
And another thing my therapist pointed out is like, you know what, you know what, aside from being like cheating, you know, if you were to just do what's easy and fun for you and let yourself be good at it and fast at it.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
And it's like you you you work like barely at all.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Aside from not being fair.

10:09.000 --> 10:21.000
Another thing that that would be is effeminate because it's like I have this masculine relationship, this faux Hemingway relationship with the idea of writing.

10:21.000 --> 10:35.000
Like, oh, you've got to dig and make and decide and create and alter and and and ultimately it's it's taking something that should not be dichotomous.

10:35.000 --> 10:45.000
It should be success and failure or kill or be killed or good or bad writing and and and it and turning it into that.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
That's what you do when you're like competitive and petty and self loathing and about your work.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Like, oh, I want to this is a shot.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I'm writing shitty today.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Now I'm writing good.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
This has to be the best.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
And then you wonder why you take six months to write something that could take you three hours.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
Like, you've decided to like get into a ring and like make everything about like combat.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
And do you write every day?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Do you like?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
No, no.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Do you dip?

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
But when you when you decide I'm going to write today, do you write like a couple of hours?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Do you write?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
How long?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I mean, do you sit down and go, I'm going to do a marathon?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Or do you do like?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I have a 10 minutes at a time.

11:24.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm interested here because the because I'll answer that question, the show after I turn in the script that I've been working on for way too long.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Right.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Because I want to answer that question honestly.

11:35.000 --> 11:51.000
And if I answer it honestly right now, the people that that that are that I've been torturing by sitting on this script like might just find me and shoot me because I know that that answer is that that's part of the thing that we dread is like, well, what page are you on?

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
What what what how long did you know, like what's the it's like?

11:55.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, if I if I was working six hours a day, this entire time on this and focusing on it, of course, it would have been done by now.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
I get I try to write every day.

12:10.000 --> 12:21.000
But what I end up doing is I go to my spot, I open up my laptop, and I stare at the computer for six to eight hours.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Then I close it up and then go.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
I can't work.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I'll start on it tomorrow.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
So I'll do I and I'll be doing that for months and months and months.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
I mean, believe me, I I'll maybe write like three sentences.

12:38.000 --> 12:46.000
I'll I mean, it used to be so much easier because I would write I would write because I would go, oh, I'm a shitty writer.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm just going to write a piece of shit.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
And it was so much easier back then.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
It is a good enough segue.

12:53.000 --> 13:01.000
I mean, we could because we can talk with our guest about all the other crap, which is just like everyone else just going like, holy shit, the world is exploding.

13:01.000 --> 13:10.000
And we can talk about that with our guest, but what a good segue because we have a woman writer, not a female writer.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
That's a that's a callback to one of her pieces.

13:13.000 --> 13:25.000
She's got if you go if you go to our website, Carol brown.com, you can see there's like a there's like a list of the shit she's written for Jezebel and and other sites.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
And she has blog entries and stuff and she's like it's it's it's all really great stuff.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I'm looking forward to just making friends with her chatting with her.

13:34.000 --> 13:43.000
Please welcome Carol Brown.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Hello.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I'm not good at greeting people.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
I don't know if he's terrible at it.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Hello.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Would you like some vodka?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Oh, man, you know, I'm getting over a cold.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
So vodka helps that right.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
And then it'll yeah.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
So dig in.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
You dig into the ice with your with your.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
That's a lot of ice.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
He uses all of that by the end of the show.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yeah.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Do you want me to pour it for you?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
You know, like a gentleman.

14:13.000 --> 14:21.000
I'm a guest, you know, or am I going to read an article on Jezebel next week of why men need to stop pouring.

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
You know, if I was still a Jezebel, it might be a concern.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
We'll see.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
That's good.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
That was that.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Thank you.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Thank you.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
You've also retired your shade court.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh my gosh, you know about shade court.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Well, because I went to your website.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
So I was like, like looking through all your stuff.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
I thought your voice was amazingly crisp and.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Oh, like.

14:46.000 --> 15:00.000
I was like, like, I, you, you literally have an entry that talks about this like angry black woman, like stereotype and how people can't like, and so it's, it's.

15:00.000 --> 15:14.000
It's hard to like you're a white guy and you're like, you read stuff and you go like, I want, I want to let this person know that they're intimidating because that would be a good compliment, but maybe not to.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
No, I know, I know what you mean because I've gotten intimidating.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
I think outside of the fact that I'm a black woman, like I know that I'm kind of like an intimidating person.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
So I think you can, I think you can divorce the two.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I am intimidating so you can say it.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I won't, I won't write about it tomorrow.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
You say it.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
You have a, you also have a pasta fetish.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
You have a pasta.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I live at your website.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
I was like, I think we'll probably get along.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
I think this will be fine.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
I make, I make fresh pasta.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Fancy pasta bitch.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Yeah.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
I, I do do that.

15:47.000 --> 15:55.000
It was sort of a response, I think to like I started early last year and I was like, this feels like it's going to be a long ass four years.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Hopefully.

15:56.000 --> 16:03.000
And I, I needed like some sort of, I like it because it's a busy body type of hobby.

16:03.000 --> 16:10.000
Like you, you're doing something with your hands, but it doesn't necessarily require a lot of like brain power and you can watch TV or do something like that.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
And then at the end you get to eat pasta.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
So.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
But you hate arugula and continues to make us.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
He's literally missing everything on my website.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
I was so glad to see somebody just shit on arugula.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
It's disgusting.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
I'm so tired of people acting like it's like delicious.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
It's everywhere too.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Yeah.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
They put it on everything.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
They won't, they won't, they won't put it in the menu description.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
By the way, we're going to put what you call scraggly ass and what it was about.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Arugula.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I don't even remember that one.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
It's scraggly lettuce.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
On top of your shit that's going to like.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
In the mixed salad.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
It tastes like you got lost.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Yeah.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
You know, when they give you like a side salad and they don't tell you arugula is in the side salad.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
I hate that.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
Um, but the headline item is that you're a TV writer.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
You, you, you, did you, were you on blackish?

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
No, no, I actually went from Jezebel to Gronish.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Okay.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Um, it was, it was, yeah, made, made that leap.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Um, Gronish is the spin-off of blackish.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Yes.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
I, I honestly have not only seen clips of blackish even though I did a panel with the creator

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
and we, he's, he's much more respectful to my work than obviously I am of his or toward

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
his, not of his cause I haven't seen it.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Um, but the, so I don't know.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Can you describe?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Yeah.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
So, um, blackish is about a black family.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Um, gross.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I know, right?

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
Uh, Cosby show, Esk, just in that it's like, um, you know, a well to do black family right

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
now, um, navigating all of that.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
Um, and in the show, the oldest daughter, uh, uh, her name's Zoe Johnson played by Yara

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Shahidi.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
And so our show is Yara going off to college.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Um, conveniently a different world Esk.

17:57.000 --> 18:04.000
Um, and her, her dealing with all of that and being in college right now and, and all

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
that bullshit.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Were you a different world fan?

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
I was, I was a little young to watch it while it was on, but later I, I would watch a different

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
world.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
And so you're way too young to, did you watch Cosby and like syndication or?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah, I think.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
What was it?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
What's your take as a modern millennial?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
I'm assuming millennial.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I don't know.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Okay.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
Like what's your take on the, on the, on the huckstables as, as a black family on television?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I mean, I love the Cosby show.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
I think like everyone.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
I actually still do.

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
I wrote about, I wrote a piece about this recently where like in sort of the wake of all of this

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
stuff that's happening and coming up.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
Like for me, I may not fuck with Bill Cosby anymore, but it seems really disingenuous

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
to act like I didn't love the Cosby show because it was wonderful.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
And I get that for a lot of people it's tainted now, like understandably and it could be difficult

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
to watch.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.500
But, um, you know, I'm not going to pretend like it wasn't amazing and like groundbreaking

19:02.500 --> 19:07.000
and that, um, I didn't love seeing a family like that on television.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.120
It sort of seems like, I mean, especially at its, at its high point when there were

19:11.120 --> 19:16.000
still only three or four networks, there's a different game being played that we, that

19:16.000 --> 19:20.880
we learned from now, which is that the, I'm always pointing out the Norman Lear philosophy,

19:20.880 --> 19:28.000
which is that we're not, our goal is not to like, well, I don't know.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.520
All I know is that what, what, what Norman Lear was, was, was, was like looking at himself

19:31.520 --> 19:39.120
and going like, look, I don't, I don't look like the family that I'm about to create a

19:39.120 --> 19:43.880
show for, but if I don't, um, nobody will.

19:43.880 --> 19:47.440
And then the syndrome will continue where people are watching television and seeing

19:47.440 --> 19:50.600
nobody that looks like them, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

19:50.600 --> 19:57.240
And, um, and so like it's, it just seems like TV, like we, we, we made a decision to worship

19:57.240 --> 19:58.240
it.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.280
We made a decision, a decision that, that it wasn't even going to be about quality.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.280
It's not art.

20:03.280 --> 20:09.440
It was like, uh, it's like a barn raising or a church, you know, like we, and so it,

20:09.440 --> 20:17.840
it, that I watched the Cosby show every night and like I was, it was like, you know, you

20:17.840 --> 20:22.160
would read in TV guide this and that about the idea of it having something to do with

20:22.160 --> 20:25.920
blackness, but the more important thing was that it was the Cosby show and it was, it

20:25.920 --> 20:29.160
was the Huckstables and it was like always going to be amazing and funny.

20:29.160 --> 20:33.360
And part of that was like listening to this like audience that may or may not have existed

20:33.360 --> 20:39.160
in the live studio, losing their fucking shit because this episode is about, you know, might

20:39.160 --> 20:44.000
come down to Bill Cosby, like making a face for his daughter to help her get over a cold

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
or something.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.160
And it just doesn't, everyone's just pissing themselves and we just, we just took part

20:49.160 --> 20:50.160
in it.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.080
I don't know what my God damn point is.

20:52.080 --> 20:57.920
I'm having my very first, like I'm a bad interviewer vodka, so it's not going to make me a good

20:57.920 --> 21:06.640
interviewer, but like, so what, so your perspective on this though is like, it's a little different,

21:06.640 --> 21:11.280
like, because I'm, I'm possibly 20 or more years older than you have no idea.

21:11.280 --> 21:20.360
I'm not going to ask, um, but like, what do you, what do you make of these shifting definitions?

21:20.360 --> 21:29.600
Like as far as, as far as white people are concerned, like your advice to them, like

21:29.600 --> 21:33.800
in terms of like, are you supposed to, let's just start with the basic, are you supposed

21:33.800 --> 21:41.440
to recognize race or, or this fantasy of being colorblind, like, like, let's get that out

21:41.440 --> 21:42.440
of there.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.440
Don't say colorblind.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.440
Yeah, that's bad.

21:44.440 --> 21:49.920
Like we tried that for like this tremendous amount of time and it just didn't, it's not

21:49.920 --> 21:50.920
real.

21:50.920 --> 21:55.440
I don't want, I don't know that, and it, colorblindness is, is sort of saying like, just pretend

21:55.440 --> 21:56.680
everyone's white.

21:56.680 --> 22:01.760
That's like kind of what people mean when they say colorblind and like, I don't want, like

22:01.760 --> 22:06.880
I like being black, so I don't need anyone to act like I'm not, and I'm sure that other

22:06.880 --> 22:09.600
people of color like being whatever they are.

22:09.600 --> 22:13.880
And so, and I'm sure white people love being white because it seems incredible.

22:13.880 --> 22:17.920
So, um, I went into a library the other day and they said, you don't have to bring the

22:17.920 --> 22:18.920
books back.

22:18.920 --> 22:19.920
Really?

22:19.920 --> 22:20.920
Yeah.

22:20.920 --> 22:21.920
I was just like, what?

22:21.920 --> 22:22.920
They're like, they did this like gesture.

22:22.920 --> 22:27.760
I was like, oh, and then there was a black guy behind me and they were like, this is

22:27.760 --> 22:28.760
overdue.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.800
And he was like, well, I know that's how the libraries work and the person, the librarian

22:31.800 --> 22:32.800
was like, shh.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.640
I didn't know that's what they meant by shh.

22:34.640 --> 22:35.640
All right.

22:35.640 --> 22:36.640
And it was, sorry.

22:36.640 --> 22:40.280
The, the, um, what is going on?

22:40.280 --> 22:43.600
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I followed all of that.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.600
Yeah.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.600
The, the, the, the, but, okay.

22:45.600 --> 22:50.040
So this is your, this is your first step into TV, right?

22:50.040 --> 22:51.960
From prose, from essay.

22:51.960 --> 22:52.960
Yes.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.520
Um, how did you get the job?

22:54.520 --> 22:55.760
Um, I got the job.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.600
So I had been, so I'd been at Jezebel.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.920
I actually, like when I moved to LA, I moved, I was living in New York.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.960
I moved to LA with the intention of getting into TV writing.

23:04.960 --> 23:08.320
Um, and I had a really strong start at Jezebel.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.640
So I kind of got distracted.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.760
I was like, Tana Hasey Coates knows my name.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.520
Who the fuck cares about TV?

23:14.520 --> 23:19.760
And then Gawker filed for bankruptcy and I panicked.

23:19.760 --> 23:24.040
And also I think it clarified that ultimately what I was trying to do.

23:24.040 --> 23:29.040
And so I had been working on a sample that I ended up finishing in like two weeks out

23:29.040 --> 23:33.200
of just like sheer desperation, um, and a friend, he helped me edit it.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.920
And then he actually, he was wrapped, he's wrapped at CAA.

23:36.920 --> 23:41.120
They were having this comedy writers boot camp kind of seminar thing and it was aimed

23:41.120 --> 23:46.480
towards women and people of color, um, and so they're like panels and networking, whatever.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.680
And so Issa Rae was one of the speakers.

23:48.680 --> 23:52.280
And so I knew that she, she followed me on Twitter and I was like, I know, I think she

23:52.280 --> 23:54.440
knows who I am and has read my writing.

23:54.440 --> 23:57.840
And so I went up to her and she immediately was like, Oh my God, hello, look, I didn't

23:57.840 --> 23:59.640
know you were interested in TV.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.280
And so she had her deal, she has her deal with HBO.

24:02.280 --> 24:07.640
And so she was looking for a material and I was like, I literally have this one script.

24:07.640 --> 24:11.480
And I sent it to her team and they're like, cool, and they liked it and they sent it

24:11.480 --> 24:12.480
to HBO.

24:12.480 --> 24:16.840
And then all of a sudden I had a meeting with an Amy at HBO, which meant nothing to me.

24:16.840 --> 24:22.520
I was like, I don't know guys, I'm going to, she's the head of comedy at HBO, had no idea.

24:22.520 --> 24:26.520
And people, um, a bunch of people who like didn't really give a shit before started to

24:26.520 --> 24:27.520
give a shit.

24:27.520 --> 24:30.560
So like that's how I got my agents, because like I had sort of been sending things to

24:30.560 --> 24:35.240
friends and agencies and obviously nobody cared until you had something going on.

24:35.240 --> 24:43.960
And then I just spent the beginning of 2017, like doing all those generals and that slog.

24:43.960 --> 24:49.320
And then I had been going into ABC a lot and they kept being like, we think Kenya, Kenya

24:49.320 --> 24:53.160
Bears who created Blackish and created Gronich, they're like, we think Kenya will like you,

24:53.160 --> 24:54.480
we think Kenya will like you.

24:54.480 --> 24:58.280
And I kind of had to wait until the show had been picked up.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.120
He didn't like want to meet anyone until everything was ready.

25:01.120 --> 25:06.400
And then I drove to Encino and we had, we had coffee and, and then I got the job.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.400
This is exciting.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.400
Yeah.

25:08.400 --> 25:14.000
Are you, are you, so you're just, you're a staff writer entering and like, are, what

25:14.000 --> 25:17.160
are, what are, well, and you can say, I don't want to talk about this because I don't want

25:17.160 --> 25:21.440
to start my, my TV career, uh, even risking doing the right thing, but I was just like

25:21.440 --> 25:24.920
curious, like what are your, what are your nightmare scenarios in your head when you

25:24.920 --> 25:26.400
think about the first day of school?

25:26.400 --> 25:30.780
Like I, the thing is I had been working from home for three years.

25:30.780 --> 25:36.120
So the idea of just interacting with humans all day was like, I, it was all I need.

25:36.120 --> 25:40.360
Like I was so desperate for human contact that it would have had to have been such an

25:40.360 --> 25:45.640
unbelievable nightmare for me to have like been unhappy with the setup.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.120
So, um, I don't know.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.960
I just didn't really like, one of the things that I think has helped me is there's a lot

25:50.960 --> 25:54.040
of stuff that I didn't really know, like in the same way that I didn't really know who

25:54.040 --> 25:55.640
Amy was.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.880
I was like, I don't know guys, like this will be fine.

25:58.880 --> 26:02.840
And, um, because I didn't really know what to be afraid of.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.920
I wasn't that afraid of things.

26:05.920 --> 26:11.300
Most of the value in a staff writer, I mean, like, like you're, the town runs on fresh

26:11.300 --> 26:13.000
blood from the Midwest.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.160
By the way, where did you grow up?

26:14.160 --> 26:17.160
I grew up in Seattle, Seattle, Washington.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.160
Yeah.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.360
That, that naivete, Schrab and I are never going to get that back where we did our best

26:21.360 --> 26:24.040
writing when we were probably how old you are.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.040
I'm not going to ask.

26:25.040 --> 26:29.080
Um, but we were like, we, we wrote this pilot called heat vision and jagged it might as

26:29.080 --> 26:30.080
well have been called.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.280
We don't know how TV works.

26:31.280 --> 26:36.600
Like, like we just, we just grew up watching it and we just like love the idea of a talking

26:36.600 --> 26:37.600
motorcycle kind of thing.

26:37.600 --> 26:41.880
It was like, like that naivete is, which is a bad word for it.

26:41.880 --> 26:44.400
It's, it's, it's, it's not naivete.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.880
It's, it's, I mean, there was so much stuff I didn't, like when the scripts kept coming

26:47.880 --> 26:52.840
back in different colors and I was like, I was like, I didn't want to ask anyone.

26:52.840 --> 26:57.000
Like, obviously I was going to ask, like, you know, someone in charge.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.320
And so I might have asked one of the writers assistants, or I think I maybe just figured

27:00.320 --> 27:01.320
it out.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.320
I was like, Oh, it's a different draft.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.280
It's a different draft when the scripts are in different color.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.480
And I was like, Oh, it's purple today.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.360
Does that mean I did bad?

27:09.360 --> 27:10.360
Yeah.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.920
Like didn't really figure it out.

27:11.920 --> 27:12.920
Um, yeah.

27:12.920 --> 27:13.920
I never knew.

27:13.920 --> 27:18.720
I guess I kind of still don't know when, because people will like make jokes about,

27:18.720 --> 27:19.720
you know, in community.

27:19.720 --> 27:25.520
It's like, okay, we're on, we're on tier three of like, we've been in salmon.

27:25.520 --> 27:28.200
We've been in triple, triple, triple blues.

27:28.200 --> 27:33.200
We've definitely flipped the, flipped the rainbow a couple times with our rewrites.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.200
Like,

27:34.200 --> 27:36.080
What do you do when you go back to blue?

27:36.080 --> 27:41.480
You just hope by that time, it's mathematically impossible that there's a still blue pages

27:41.480 --> 27:45.320
left from the first time you had a meltdown.

27:45.320 --> 27:50.440
If you've done that many rewrites, how can it be possible that there's still first blue?

27:50.440 --> 27:55.080
I think you, I think there is some kind of like, I, I, this is, this is why writers

27:55.080 --> 28:00.640
when that situation is happening, you, you're less concerned exactly which blue pages you're

28:00.640 --> 28:04.000
looking at because it's like we're fucking 12 days behind.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Yeah.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.200
Well, I also, I also, like it, it makes me wonder, yeah, I always, I would never could

28:10.200 --> 28:16.040
tell because who's going to come up to me and say, um, you know, there's way too many

28:16.040 --> 28:19.040
colors in the binder, you know, it's fucking ridiculous.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.840
I would always say this is getting crazy.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.480
Can we, can we repaginate?

28:22.480 --> 28:27.600
Like this is like, because they do this thing where the pages break because they don't want

28:27.600 --> 28:29.040
the other page numbers to change.

28:29.040 --> 28:33.680
So then you end up on community and feel like, you know, just turn the page and then Troy

28:33.680 --> 28:40.520
says, uh, Troy and Abed in the, and then you've turned the page because I changed it to morning.

28:40.520 --> 28:48.480
Um, anyways, the, uh, that's, that's, that's a reason why I, as much as I, I understand

28:48.480 --> 28:53.640
that people who like tweet me or through other channels like inquire about the concept of

28:53.640 --> 28:58.520
a writer's assistant, I know that the image in their head is like of a squire with like

28:58.520 --> 29:04.560
a quill, you know, that he hands to Shakespeare when Shakespeare gets in a duel with, with

29:04.560 --> 29:06.440
another writer.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.440
And that happens.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.440
It does happen.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.440
It's just not the main part of the job.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.440
Yeah.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.440
It's not, it's not.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.440
I think God, I never had to be here.

29:12.440 --> 29:17.640
I would have been, if I had had to come up and sort of like the traditional, like a P.A.

29:17.640 --> 29:18.640
and then a writer's P.A.

29:18.640 --> 29:21.840
And I would have, I wouldn't, I would have found a different career.

29:21.840 --> 29:22.840
I'm not organized.

29:22.840 --> 29:28.400
Like I find that job insane and they're so like, I would have, I wouldn't have made

29:28.400 --> 29:29.400
it through a season of television.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.400
That's right.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.400
Yeah, for sure.

29:31.400 --> 29:36.520
I, I, it's, it's, it's legitimately, I guess, I guess I'm saying this like it's a mindblower

29:36.520 --> 29:41.400
because what isn't it, but it's harder work than the, the, the writing on the show.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.960
We just sit around and talk.

29:42.960 --> 29:43.960
Yeah.

29:43.960 --> 29:47.160
And the fact that the writer's assistant is there means that what is, well, already

29:47.160 --> 29:52.120
an easier, easy job, which is going, what if a guy had a horse?

29:52.120 --> 29:56.880
We now just like sit there and like vape and go, what if a guy had a horse and like it's

29:56.880 --> 30:04.400
up to Tim to remember that we said it and a lot of those people are good writers.

30:04.400 --> 30:09.760
It's not like, oh, those people are science brains, like they're clerical thinkers.

30:09.760 --> 30:13.800
Like they're, no, they're, they're, they're decent writers who go on to good writing careers

30:13.800 --> 30:17.960
and, and, and then you look back and go, oh man, that poor fucking guy.

30:17.960 --> 30:18.960
I, yeah.

30:18.960 --> 30:19.960
Oh, anyways.

30:19.960 --> 30:20.960
Couldn't have been me.

30:20.960 --> 30:27.600
Well, let's talk about like fraud complex, have you, have you, is it, is it, is it different

30:27.600 --> 30:28.600
for you?

30:28.600 --> 30:29.600
Like at all?

30:29.600 --> 30:35.080
Like you, you, you're, you, you, when you leap from the pages of, of, of the internets

30:35.080 --> 30:40.680
into, into a writer's room like that, do you ever, like, are you, are you plagued with

30:40.680 --> 30:43.720
anxiety about, I don't deserve this or anything like that?

30:43.720 --> 30:48.880
I mean, I think one of the things for me is that I had been writing professionally for

30:48.880 --> 30:51.640
three years, like people were giving me money to write.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.480
And also because it's the internet, I was getting a lot of feedback.

30:54.480 --> 30:59.360
So I was like, I know, like when I first wrote that, that script, I was like, I know I'm

30:59.360 --> 31:03.280
not a shitty writer because like it would have, someone would have figured it out over

31:03.280 --> 31:04.280
the course of three years.

31:04.280 --> 31:08.640
I don't know if I'm good at writing comedy scripts, but it's probably not going to be

31:08.640 --> 31:12.480
super shitty because I'm not a super shitty writer.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.680
So it helped me in that regard.

31:14.680 --> 31:20.920
I mean, I feel like even now, like I just wrote, I wrote a cover story for the fader

31:20.920 --> 31:25.560
on the singer SZA and it was the first feature like profile I'd ever written.

31:25.560 --> 31:29.280
And so I, when I finished the story, I was like, I think this is fine.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.680
I was like, this is a fine story.

31:31.680 --> 31:36.600
And the response has been much, people think it's much better than fine.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.460
But that's usually how I am with my writing.

31:38.460 --> 31:41.320
So I, you know, even like when I was at Jezebel and I would write something, I was like,

31:41.320 --> 31:42.520
this isn't that funny.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.840
And then the commenters like are finding it really funny.

31:44.840 --> 31:49.240
So I know that my standard is different.

31:49.240 --> 31:53.960
So I think it, and I kind of knew that so I was like, even if I think this is fine,

31:53.960 --> 31:56.160
I think other people think it's better than that.

31:56.160 --> 32:00.280
So I wasn't as nervous about that.

32:00.280 --> 32:01.280
But I don't know.

32:01.280 --> 32:05.440
It's like, also it's funny, like my dad says this, I lived in Dallas, Texas until I was

32:05.440 --> 32:06.440
seven.

32:06.440 --> 32:11.800
And so my dad talked about when he was raising me and my sister, my mom was there too, but

32:11.800 --> 32:13.320
he tells the story.

32:13.320 --> 32:17.160
And he's like, I really raised, tried to make sure that you had a lot of self-esteem because

32:17.160 --> 32:22.120
I didn't want to raise like a little black girl in the South to not have a lot of self-esteem

32:22.120 --> 32:24.640
because there were probably a lot of things that would crush that.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.840
And so, and then his punchline is that like he went too far.

32:27.840 --> 32:33.320
That's never been a real big problem for me.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.320
Yeah.

32:34.320 --> 32:38.920
My mom made it very, very clear that I could do anything I wanted.

32:38.920 --> 32:45.880
And at 45, I sometimes like, now I'm entering an age where I'm like, I'm like, what if she

32:45.880 --> 32:46.880
was lying?

32:46.880 --> 32:51.680
Like, and then I'm like, well, too late, like everybody else bought it.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.680
Which is probably the idea, right?

32:52.680 --> 32:53.680
Like that.

32:53.680 --> 32:58.440
I mean, it is like when we talk about, because I've always used the example when I'm on

32:58.440 --> 33:04.120
panels and stuff of like, you know, being a guy that like wishes he could, you know,

33:04.120 --> 33:10.240
on some regard, as far as doing the right thing with a job that is very like, not a

33:10.240 --> 33:19.040
cakewalk, but an honor privilege, like a rare thing to come by this job, like my white guilt

33:19.040 --> 33:24.920
and stuff and like always makes me, what am I supposed to do to like take my little piece

33:24.920 --> 33:30.480
of the industry and like try to like make sure I left it a little better than I came

33:30.480 --> 33:37.480
into it and the metaphor that I've constantly used is like the problem isn't that, you know,

33:37.480 --> 33:41.720
we can talk about representation of the writers and all these things, but like we've the syndrome

33:41.720 --> 33:52.440
ends the day that a black girl in sixth grade right now is watching TV and going like, oh,

33:52.440 --> 33:59.680
I think I'll try writing that, which I just don't think it was in when I was your age,

33:59.680 --> 34:05.640
probably I won't ask the, I think that I don't think that that was even a remote, it was like,

34:05.640 --> 34:08.680
that's what we talked, I think that's what we're getting at when we talk about those

34:08.680 --> 34:13.520
systemic like, yeah, problems that are that are now, we're not going to pretend that they're

34:13.520 --> 34:18.160
ending, but that that that we'd noticed that the actual like profound changes are coming

34:18.160 --> 34:22.720
in the form of show running, like, yeah, I mean, Shonda Rhimes was like, when I first

34:22.720 --> 34:26.800
watched Grey's Anatomy, and then, because you know, since Seattle, it's really, we're

34:26.800 --> 34:31.280
going to watch the show, and then when I saw a picture of her for the first time, because

34:31.280 --> 34:36.000
like, you don't see to the showrunner, you know, unless it's, so the first time I saw

34:36.000 --> 34:39.680
a picture of her, and I was like, oh my God, like this black, Shonda Rhimes could be like

34:39.680 --> 34:47.400
an old Jewish guy, it's kind of like, Shonda, we're going for lunch and working on the rewrites,

34:47.400 --> 34:51.480
like could have been, and then I saw the picture and I was like, I think that was like, that

34:51.480 --> 34:57.840
was a very important thing for me, like, oh, she's doing this, and that that person exists

34:57.840 --> 34:58.840
and is doing this.

34:58.840 --> 34:59.840
It's a job.

34:59.840 --> 35:00.840
It's a job you can do.

35:00.840 --> 35:06.640
It's like, like, yeah, I just think, and I, it's not, I was just, you know, like I go

35:06.640 --> 35:11.560
to the extreme place with like little black girl, like that image, but it's like little

35:11.560 --> 35:12.560
kids in general.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.560
Yeah.

35:13.560 --> 35:14.560
But herein lies the problem.

35:14.560 --> 35:19.160
Now, like, in terms of your biography to segue into that, because I always feel like

35:19.160 --> 35:24.960
then, but we can't tell people to take a shot at this job.

35:24.960 --> 35:28.280
It would, it's, there's part of that is extremely irresponsible.

35:28.280 --> 35:32.600
It would be more responsible to tell somebody to try being a doctor, because there's like

35:32.600 --> 35:41.840
definitive milestones, scholarships, tests, a million chances for you to, for you and

35:41.840 --> 35:45.880
I as somebody who might say to somebody, you should be a writer, like, like for us to have

35:45.880 --> 35:48.280
sent that person on a path to hell.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.280
Yeah.

35:49.280 --> 35:54.600
It seems like something, I don't know, like, I, one of the things I hate is when someone

35:54.600 --> 35:58.200
like wins an award, like, and, you know, and they're up there and they're like, follow

35:58.200 --> 35:59.200
your dreams.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.200
You can do anything.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.600
It's like, are you good at that thing though?

36:01.600 --> 36:04.040
Because you shouldn't be telling people who are bad at something.

36:04.040 --> 36:09.960
Like you, at a certain point, you know, I think you have an inkling of like, can I do

36:09.960 --> 36:10.960
this?

36:10.960 --> 36:12.160
Is this really like, is this possible?

36:12.160 --> 36:14.040
Do I believe in myself, whatever?

36:14.040 --> 36:17.880
And like, I don't think you should be like, I think that's an important thing to remember.

36:17.880 --> 36:22.720
But also, we got to be honest, like even a lower middle class white guy like myself,

36:22.720 --> 36:26.960
I think like there is a support system there.

36:26.960 --> 36:33.000
I mean, I was borrowing money from my mom for, you know, well into my twenties.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.240
And like, my mom was like, yeah, you, you look like a comedian.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.240
You look like a writer.

36:39.240 --> 36:43.400
You know, here's another three grand for, you know, what really turned out to be cocaine

36:43.400 --> 36:53.840
and weed and like, but like, it was like, I can't fathom that that exists in, in the

36:53.840 --> 36:58.800
neighborhoods that would, that it would be important for that to be because it's like,

36:58.800 --> 37:02.480
but that's where my brain turns into a balloon animal because I'm like, you can't tell a

37:02.480 --> 37:08.280
poor kid, like a dirt poor kid, um, yeah, you should go, you should try being a writer.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.280
You can, your dreams, you can do anything.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.040
It's like, no, we can't.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.040
Yeah.

37:13.040 --> 37:19.280
And like I, in a lot of ways, like my, when I was living in New York, um, I was working

37:19.280 --> 37:23.800
in PR and I had, um, I was just like blogging all the time.

37:23.800 --> 37:27.000
And so Jezebel had offered me an editorial fellowship.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.680
So that was a job that was at the time it was part time minimum wage.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.720
And it was something where like, if I had asked my parents for help, they would have,

37:33.720 --> 37:37.280
if I was like, this is my dream, they would have, they would have helped me.

37:37.280 --> 37:40.400
They would have supported me and I, and I knew that I had that as an option.

37:40.400 --> 37:45.640
Um, but I also was just like, I don't want to ask them for help for something that I'm

37:45.640 --> 37:48.160
not like, Oh, this is, this is like the dream.

37:48.160 --> 37:52.800
Um, I like to save my big favors for, you know, when like I really need it.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.400
And I was like, I don't know if I need this bad enough.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.280
Um, I also want to lower my $3,000 number.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.680
That was me adjusting for like Trump dollars.

37:59.680 --> 38:03.720
Um, uh, you know, my, that was like $100.

38:03.720 --> 38:06.800
I never got, I never got more than you can get out of an ATM from my mom.

38:06.800 --> 38:10.120
No, but like, I definitely spent it all on Coke and weed.

38:10.120 --> 38:14.560
Like, so it really wasn't privilege, like I didn't spend it on a typewriter, right?

38:14.560 --> 38:16.040
Um, but yeah.

38:16.040 --> 38:19.240
And also I want to put another asterisk on something I said, because if they're, it's

38:19.240 --> 38:24.240
like, like, no, no, they can't, they can't, it's like, well, no, I mean, it's, it's not

38:24.240 --> 38:25.240
as easy.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.240
There's no equivalent.

38:26.240 --> 38:30.120
And if you don't know anyone, like one of the, the most helpful things for me is when

38:30.120 --> 38:35.640
I moved LA and I started meeting TV writers and I was like, Oh, these people are not that

38:35.640 --> 38:36.640
impressive.

38:36.640 --> 38:40.800
Surely I can figure this out if these dumb, dumb figured it out.

38:40.800 --> 38:44.640
And like, I think that was really important to like realize that like, Oh, these are just

38:44.640 --> 38:45.640
regular.

38:45.640 --> 38:50.560
Most of them are regular people doing this, but like if you don't live in LA and you're

38:50.560 --> 38:53.640
not around those people, I have no idea how you would figure that out.

38:53.640 --> 38:56.080
Like it seems like this mythical unreachable thing.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.080
Yeah.

38:57.080 --> 39:03.200
It's difficult to figure out when the actual empire that is the geographically located Hollywood

39:03.200 --> 39:10.560
will just bottom out because it seems by a logical assessment that it's a total non-necessity

39:10.560 --> 39:11.560
anymore.

39:11.560 --> 39:15.040
And we know that people are shooting things in Portland and Vancouver and all over and

39:15.040 --> 39:20.040
that a city, a city going broke now a great way for them is to give tax incentives and

39:20.040 --> 39:22.000
say, come shoot here and we will do it.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.920
So you keep, I keep wondering like, why are we here?

39:24.920 --> 39:25.920
What's going on?

39:25.920 --> 39:30.320
But it, that's one thing that hasn't changed in 50 years is like, Oh yeah, you move to

39:30.320 --> 39:37.000
LA and you get a drink in a bar and you are immediately gaining some kind of advantage

39:37.000 --> 39:42.960
over someone who's in Minneapolis aspiring to, to write one day because you're just,

39:42.960 --> 39:43.960
it's just erosion.

39:43.960 --> 39:47.240
It's just, it's just like you're, you're going to run into somebody, you're going to

39:47.240 --> 39:51.880
overhear jokes, you're going to, like you're just, you're just getting desensitized to

39:51.880 --> 39:56.440
what is otherwise an impossibly mythical kingdom.

39:56.440 --> 39:57.440
And you're right.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.560
It's just a bunch of normal morons.

39:59.560 --> 40:02.160
You know, like we're just, we're just piddling around out here.

40:02.160 --> 40:05.800
Like we're plumbers that, that, that didn't have to qualify for anything.

40:05.800 --> 40:09.440
We don't, we don't even have to, you, you, because you keep, there's no, there's no

40:09.440 --> 40:10.440
bar.

40:10.440 --> 40:11.440
You really have to.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.440
Yeah.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.240
Like you can't prove that the toilet is leaking in writing.

40:14.240 --> 40:18.360
You can, you can say it, but we can also go, well, I think you have bad taste.

40:18.360 --> 40:21.480
I don't think you really understand what a toilet is, sir.

40:21.480 --> 40:27.480
Um, it, uh, but, but yeah, specifically like class wise, where would you place yourself

40:27.480 --> 40:28.480
growing up?

40:28.480 --> 40:32.000
Um, I mean, my dad, my dad worked at Microsoft.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.400
That's why he grew up in Seattle, but we moved back.

40:35.400 --> 40:39.960
So like, you know, I went to, I went to a private school, I went to a private university.

40:39.960 --> 40:44.600
So like I, you know, I don't, I had a lot of friends, I had a lot of friends that were

40:44.600 --> 40:46.520
like very wealthy.

40:46.520 --> 40:49.600
And so I knew we weren't that, but I was like, we're fine.

40:49.600 --> 40:54.880
So I didn't, you know, we weren't like, but life was nice for sure.

40:54.880 --> 41:00.440
What do you think Schrabs thinking over there, how, how is growing up for you?

41:00.440 --> 41:02.160
It is all right.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.160
It was okay.

41:04.160 --> 41:12.320
I lived in a small town and I drew a lot and I made like stop motion animated movies.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.320
That's fun.

41:13.320 --> 41:17.720
And, uh, Schrabs hometown, Mayville, Wisconsin, there's a billboard outside of it.

41:17.720 --> 41:22.680
You know, like, like how towns have signs with logos and slogans and things.

41:22.680 --> 41:28.200
And, uh, Mayville was, um, was, uh, the last stop where you could get like supplies if

41:28.200 --> 41:33.280
you were going to go to a place called Horicon, which is like, um, um, duck hunting territory.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.280
Okay.

41:34.280 --> 41:37.240
And, uh, and so that was like a big thing for a town of that size.

41:37.240 --> 41:43.080
So the, the sign outside of Rob's hometown says, welcome to Mayville gateway to the marsh.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.080
Yeah.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.080
Wow.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.080
Yeah.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.080
Wow.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.080
And one, I was not jealous of that.

41:49.080 --> 41:50.080
I know.

41:50.080 --> 41:58.600
And one, one, there was like a time where McDonald's, I come from like a 3000, 5000 population

41:58.600 --> 42:05.080
town and they, we had a McDonald's in town and that was a big deal and McDonald's gave

42:05.080 --> 42:12.240
us a sign that said with Ronald McDonald on it and it said, Mayville gateway to the marsh.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.440
Oh, Ronald McDonald was on that sign.

42:14.440 --> 42:15.440
On it.

42:15.440 --> 42:16.440
I don't know if I ever could.

42:16.440 --> 42:17.960
Like going, Hey, we own you now.

42:17.960 --> 42:18.960
That's hilarious.

42:18.960 --> 42:24.840
It's, it's like Adderall giving you a defibrillator, but they, but the, the town wasn't big enough

42:24.840 --> 42:31.640
and they went, they closed down McDonald's and they took the sign away, they took the

42:31.640 --> 42:34.560
sign away, took the sign away.

42:34.560 --> 42:41.240
I guess they didn't want to get sued by somebody who was like, look, I'm, I have reverse diabetes.

42:41.240 --> 42:47.720
I need, I needed a, a big Mac and you made me think I could get one here.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.160
I was expecting a McDonald's.

42:49.160 --> 42:52.760
I'm suing you for all your duck ammunition and then they turned, they, they turned the

42:52.760 --> 42:57.000
McDonald's that they was bought and turned into a mom and pop burger shop.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.760
It was called Bumpy Burgers.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.760
That's maybe better.

43:00.760 --> 43:01.760
Right.

43:01.760 --> 43:02.760
Bumpy.

43:02.760 --> 43:03.760
I don't know.

43:03.760 --> 43:04.760
Mom and pop.

43:04.760 --> 43:09.120
You know, that seems on, on brand for what this town sounds like to me.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.120
Yeah.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.640
It's grown, it's done for its season.

43:11.640 --> 43:12.640
You do.

43:12.640 --> 43:13.640
You're finishing the whole season.

43:13.640 --> 43:14.640
Yeah.

43:14.640 --> 43:15.640
We finished.

43:15.640 --> 43:16.640
We got a.

43:16.640 --> 43:17.640
Are we done?

43:17.640 --> 43:18.640
Yeah.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.640
I move around.

43:19.640 --> 43:20.640
I stir.

43:20.640 --> 43:21.640
Okay.

43:21.640 --> 43:22.640
I'm a good host.

43:22.640 --> 43:23.640
All right.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.640
Um, we got a second season, 20 episode order.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.640
So.

43:26.640 --> 43:27.640
Oh, cool.

43:27.640 --> 43:28.640
It's, it's happening.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.640
What network is that?

43:29.640 --> 43:32.640
It's on free form, which is what ABC family family.

43:32.640 --> 43:33.640
Yeah.

43:33.640 --> 43:34.640
Oh, okay.

43:34.640 --> 43:35.640
It's rebranding.

43:35.640 --> 43:40.040
So it sounds like it's like one of these internet channels, but it's real TV.

43:40.040 --> 43:41.040
It's real TV.

43:41.040 --> 43:42.040
And it's TV.

43:42.040 --> 43:43.040
We get to say shit.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.040
Yeah.

43:44.040 --> 43:45.040
We get to bleep out a fuck.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.040
Yeah.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.040
It's exciting to me.

43:47.040 --> 43:48.040
I've, I've had several.

43:48.040 --> 43:52.200
I got, I got projects going where the big, you know, like I'm not allowed to talk about

43:52.200 --> 43:53.200
them yet.

43:53.200 --> 43:54.200
Because then you get to do a thing.

43:54.200 --> 43:56.520
But like there's, they're right.

43:56.520 --> 44:02.040
I'm very excited about what, what do you mean you're not allowed to talk about it?

44:02.040 --> 44:06.760
I mean, like what, what's the worst that's going to happen if you start talking about

44:06.760 --> 44:07.760
it?

44:07.760 --> 44:08.760
They will.

44:08.760 --> 44:09.760
But they'll take it away.

44:09.760 --> 44:10.760
It'll be fine.

44:10.760 --> 44:11.760
I don't, I don't know.

44:11.760 --> 44:16.440
I just know, like, if you don't like to try and see, I've, I've, I've, I've tried

44:16.440 --> 44:22.400
to, I've done my 20 years of seeing what the worst could, that could happen is if I say

44:22.400 --> 44:23.400
stuff.

44:23.400 --> 44:24.400
And you're still here.

44:24.400 --> 44:25.400
I know.

44:25.400 --> 44:26.400
So like now.

44:26.400 --> 44:27.400
What are you afraid of?

44:27.400 --> 44:30.440
Kevin Smith just said to me when I was talking to him, he's like, cause he's going vegan

44:30.440 --> 44:31.440
because he just had his heart attack.

44:31.440 --> 44:34.440
And he's like, he's got friends that are like, well, it was now just cause you have a heart

44:34.440 --> 44:35.440
attack.

44:35.440 --> 44:36.440
You're a pussy.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.400
He's like, I ate meat forever.

44:38.400 --> 44:41.040
I'm now interested in vegetables.

44:41.040 --> 44:43.800
He's not like, he's not like hit me with your best shot.

44:43.800 --> 44:46.800
He's like, I now have polio.

44:46.800 --> 44:51.800
I mean, I'm just like, no, it's an, I mean, I'm, I'm tired, man.

44:51.800 --> 44:56.440
I'm Gandalf the, the, uh, beyond gray.

44:56.440 --> 45:00.640
It looks like Spencer's wearing the table as shorts.

45:00.640 --> 45:01.640
I am.

45:01.640 --> 45:06.760
Um, anyone's wearing a table they're sitting at.

45:06.760 --> 45:11.560
Anyways, I was just going to say that, that like tomorrow's, tomorrow's Emmys and certainly

45:11.560 --> 45:16.840
tomorrow's shows that I want to watch are, they're being produced by like a really big

45:16.840 --> 45:17.840
A list people.

45:17.840 --> 45:18.840
Emmys are on tomorrow.

45:18.840 --> 45:19.840
God damn it.

45:19.840 --> 45:20.840
Yeah.

45:20.840 --> 45:28.320
Tomorrow, like the royal tomorrow, non, non English majors, am I right?

45:28.320 --> 45:31.480
Um, the royal tomorrow.

45:31.480 --> 45:35.960
I just wanted to finish my little, my little, my little, I was talking about bumpy burgers

45:35.960 --> 45:36.960
and you moved on.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.960
What was so great about bumpy burgers?

45:38.960 --> 45:39.960
What happened there?

45:39.960 --> 45:46.840
We were talking about something, had something, she wasn't patronizing you.

45:46.840 --> 45:48.040
You don't know that.

45:48.040 --> 45:49.480
I, I was interested.

45:49.480 --> 45:50.480
Okay.

45:50.480 --> 45:51.480
Thank you.

45:51.480 --> 45:53.080
Well, you know, I have a weird form of burger.

45:53.080 --> 45:55.600
I'll give you two more minutes on bumpy burgers.

45:55.600 --> 45:58.760
No, I don't want to talk about it anymore.

45:58.760 --> 45:59.760
Okay.

45:59.760 --> 46:00.760
I was good.

46:00.760 --> 46:04.080
I'm, you know, I like to move around, you know, organically.

46:04.080 --> 46:05.080
Yeah.

46:05.080 --> 46:09.800
You got a second to anyways, by the way, my little joke, now I have to call it a joke

46:09.800 --> 46:11.080
and then I have to tell it.

46:11.080 --> 46:12.080
And it's just like, this is a worst.

46:12.080 --> 46:16.040
I was going to say this little cause I was going to say, well, no, I do, I do have to

46:16.040 --> 46:18.040
meet.

46:18.040 --> 46:19.040
I'm not stopping you.

46:19.040 --> 46:23.560
Please do the LA story where she has to finish the shave and a haircut on the tuba.

46:23.560 --> 46:27.880
Like, you know, but did she have to?

46:27.880 --> 46:31.280
That's why I mean it needs, I laughed at it because I knew she had to.

46:31.280 --> 46:32.280
I got it.

46:32.280 --> 46:34.360
I knew she had to finish her shave and a haircut.

46:34.360 --> 46:37.520
I, I don't remember this.

46:37.520 --> 46:38.520
I'm not going to.

46:38.520 --> 46:39.520
Okay.

46:39.520 --> 46:41.080
I didn't want you to not finish it.

46:41.080 --> 46:42.080
And you know what?

46:42.080 --> 46:43.080
It wasn't a joke.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.080
It was just a stupid turn of phrase.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.080
I was just dumb.

46:45.080 --> 46:49.200
I wasn't even, I was making it up as I went and it's just, but I don't like getting interrupted.

46:49.200 --> 46:54.080
But it's like, well, then why do I have a show if I don't like getting interrupted?

46:54.080 --> 46:55.080
What's going on?

46:55.080 --> 46:56.080
You know what?

46:56.080 --> 46:57.080
I would do it.

46:57.080 --> 46:58.080
Are we on a pirate ship?

46:58.080 --> 46:59.080
Why?

46:59.080 --> 47:00.080
Where is it?

47:00.080 --> 47:01.080
Why is everything creaking?

47:01.080 --> 47:02.080
We are taking on water.

47:02.080 --> 47:04.200
If I didn't want to get interrupted, you know what I'd do is just never talk.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.200
Yeah.

47:05.200 --> 47:09.480
Well, that's why it works for me, right?

47:09.480 --> 47:12.360
Or it could be a man, that helps also.

47:12.360 --> 47:13.360
Oh yeah.

47:13.360 --> 47:18.720
Um, but what do you, what are your aspirations because I'm not, do you know, I mean, you

47:18.720 --> 47:24.360
have to, you, you have to wait and see, are you, is your job a guarantee on season two

47:24.360 --> 47:27.600
or do you just wait and like, you know, I, I'm pretty sure.

47:27.600 --> 47:28.600
Yeah.

47:28.600 --> 47:36.640
Oh, the glimmer in the eye was, you'll have to pay $5 a month to see that the true confidence

47:36.640 --> 47:40.080
of a, of a staff writer that nailed it in season one.

47:40.080 --> 47:41.080
Yeah.

47:41.080 --> 47:43.880
I think you're looking at a story editor.

47:43.880 --> 47:46.480
Um, uh, well that's cool.

47:46.480 --> 47:47.480
But yeah.

47:47.480 --> 47:56.240
And then, and then like, long mid, mid, midterm ambitions, like, like if, if grown-ish keeps

47:56.240 --> 48:04.240
going for years and years and years, do you see yourself, uh, you know, gaining more levels

48:04.240 --> 48:09.600
in that, or do you, are you chomping at, champing at the bit to, um, are you champing at the

48:09.600 --> 48:10.600
bit?

48:10.600 --> 48:11.600
I am champing.

48:11.600 --> 48:18.040
She went to private schools, she knows it's champing, but champing sounds wrong cause everyone

48:18.040 --> 48:19.040
says chomping.

48:19.040 --> 48:20.040
Right.

48:20.040 --> 48:21.040
They don't know.

48:21.040 --> 48:23.680
It's just like Fort, instead of Forte.

48:23.680 --> 48:24.680
Yes.

48:24.680 --> 48:25.680
Exactly.

48:25.680 --> 48:26.680
Like that.

48:26.680 --> 48:27.680
Shit drives me nuts.

48:27.680 --> 48:28.680
Yeah.

48:28.680 --> 48:30.680
Drives me nuts too.

48:30.680 --> 48:36.400
Why don't you go draw something, draw a cube in perspective?

48:36.400 --> 48:40.440
Do you guys remember that game, draw something?

48:40.440 --> 48:41.440
You played it on your phone?

48:41.440 --> 48:42.440
Yeah.

48:42.440 --> 48:43.440
With friends.

48:43.440 --> 48:44.440
Yeah.

48:44.440 --> 48:45.440
I was pretty addicted to that.

48:45.440 --> 48:46.440
I was the best.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.960
The only time I would ever lose is when it was asterix, which is like some fucking cartoon

48:48.960 --> 48:52.400
character in Deutschland or something.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.800
And it's just like, it's not a real word.

48:54.800 --> 48:57.720
So how could you guess something that's a, a made up word?

48:57.720 --> 48:59.120
You could never guess that.

48:59.120 --> 49:00.120
Anyway.

49:00.120 --> 49:01.120
You ever play that game?

49:01.120 --> 49:04.480
I don't know what it, I don't know what it's called cause I've only, it's just like a,

49:04.480 --> 49:09.160
it's not like a thing you buy at Toys R Us, but it's like a game where you, it's like

49:09.160 --> 49:15.160
a party game where you, everyone writes a phrase and then you pass the stack of papers

49:15.160 --> 49:17.640
and then you look at the phrase and then you draw.

49:17.640 --> 49:18.640
Crossword.

49:18.640 --> 49:19.640
The phrase.

49:19.640 --> 49:20.640
STPs.

49:20.640 --> 49:23.280
And then you pass that and it's like a telephone game that comes back around to you.

49:23.280 --> 49:28.120
So you write Ghostbusters on the top sheet and then you hand it off and you get like

49:28.120 --> 49:33.200
Pudding Pops or whatever and you, you try to draw Pudding Pops because that's what you're

49:33.200 --> 49:34.200
reading.

49:34.200 --> 49:35.200
You got it wrong.

49:35.200 --> 49:36.200
And, and...

49:36.200 --> 49:38.120
I didn't know if you're past Pudding Pops.

49:38.120 --> 49:43.880
Anyways, it comes back around and you've got, you're like, well, I, I wrote Ghostbusters

49:43.880 --> 49:48.520
and then this is how Amanda drew Ghostbusters and because that's what she drew, this is

49:48.520 --> 49:52.200
what the next person wrote and then it's kind of, it's really fun.

49:52.200 --> 49:53.200
Oh, I get it.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.200
I have not played.

49:54.200 --> 49:57.840
Are there other movies besides Ghostbusters that you can write down?

49:57.840 --> 49:58.840
Yeah.

49:58.840 --> 49:59.840
Pudding Pops.

49:59.840 --> 50:00.840
Yeah.

50:00.840 --> 50:01.840
I just...

50:01.840 --> 50:02.840
I haven't seen that.

50:02.840 --> 50:03.840
Ghostbusters was, we tried it.

50:03.840 --> 50:08.240
Our friend KK was so drunk that we were like, it's because there's always one drunk person

50:08.240 --> 50:14.160
in the game that like either ruins it or makes it like worth playing depending on how you

50:14.160 --> 50:15.160
look at it.

50:15.160 --> 50:20.200
But like my friend Dino just wrote Ghostbusters and he's like, it's a movie with a logo even

50:20.200 --> 50:22.600
if you drop badly than the next person will.

50:22.600 --> 50:28.360
And then it went through KK and it was like, it, it came out as like this, like there were

50:28.360 --> 50:34.600
guys like pointing things at a giant peanut and it was crying and it's just such a great

50:34.600 --> 50:38.240
game because then the next person is like a giant peanut and then you're like, you have

50:38.240 --> 50:39.240
to, that's so fun.

50:39.240 --> 50:41.560
We should make a phone version of it.

50:41.560 --> 50:46.600
Or we should, we should, we should, we should have a society that effectively reproduces

50:46.600 --> 50:49.880
the effects so that by the 21st century we're almost dead.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.840
Let's talk about politics a little bit.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.280
You're, you're, you're a millennial.

50:53.280 --> 50:56.120
Are you hopeful or are you like stocking canned goods?

50:56.120 --> 51:00.400
I, you know, actually, so one of the, one of the writers in our room, she was telling

51:00.400 --> 51:04.880
us how she and her husband had just bought gas masks and was like, didn't see never

51:04.880 --> 51:05.880
going to go buy a gas mask.

51:05.880 --> 51:09.320
So I was like, okay, so I went to Amazon and they were like 80 bucks, which was like

51:09.320 --> 51:16.000
a little more than I felt like, like if it had been like 45 or 50, what did like say

51:16.000 --> 51:21.440
a friend of yours had an, an extra gas mask.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.160
And you wanted to try it out.

51:23.160 --> 51:24.160
Oh God.

51:24.160 --> 51:27.640
Well, would you be like a cheapy peepy?

51:27.640 --> 51:31.080
If you, you know what it made me realize that I didn't want to spend, if I wasn't willing

51:31.080 --> 51:35.760
to spend $80 on a gas mask, I was like, I think if I need a gas mask, I'd like to be

51:35.760 --> 51:36.760
dead.

51:36.760 --> 51:37.760
I was like, I don't want to be here.

51:37.760 --> 51:38.960
We have to run around and gas masks.

51:38.960 --> 51:41.960
I hope I go out and the, I don't want, I don't want to have to have to come back.

51:41.960 --> 51:42.960
You're going to breathe it in.

51:42.960 --> 51:46.160
You're going to be like, I just want to breathe it and then I'll go.

51:46.160 --> 51:50.640
My only thought about, that's how I feel about a nuclear strike, like I'm not going to get

51:50.640 --> 51:58.640
in the car and head for Prim Nevada so that I can have half a face for 10 years.

51:58.640 --> 52:04.200
I'm just, I'm going to like run to the impact point and like try to catch the missile in

52:04.200 --> 52:07.840
my teeth because I want to like die in a flash.

52:07.840 --> 52:09.640
But gas mask, I don't know.

52:09.640 --> 52:15.040
I don't want, because the way you die by things that, that kill you by inhaling them

52:15.040 --> 52:16.800
make you suffer.

52:16.800 --> 52:22.080
I want to, I might buy a gas mask so I can make it to my gun.

52:22.080 --> 52:23.580
I don't have a gun.

52:23.580 --> 52:24.580
I don't know.

52:24.580 --> 52:25.580
I was like, I don't have enough stuff.

52:25.580 --> 52:27.560
I bought a gun when Trump got elected.

52:27.560 --> 52:28.560
Did you?

52:28.560 --> 52:31.480
I don't, I just feel like that is part of the problem.

52:31.480 --> 52:32.480
It's part, no.

52:32.480 --> 52:33.480
It's not part of the problem.

52:33.480 --> 52:34.480
It is.

52:34.480 --> 52:35.480
It is.

52:35.480 --> 52:38.560
I've, I've, I've realized it all now, but I still got the gun.

52:38.560 --> 52:42.080
What did you, what did you think you would need the gun for?

52:42.080 --> 52:44.360
Like what, what made you, like, what did you think would happen now?

52:44.360 --> 52:46.320
To shoot his dogs weirdly.

52:46.320 --> 52:47.320
No.

52:47.320 --> 52:48.320
Well, there's that.

52:48.320 --> 52:50.520
I mean, there's always talking about shooting his dogs these days.

52:50.520 --> 52:51.520
Really?

52:51.520 --> 52:52.520
Really?

52:52.520 --> 52:53.520
Really?

52:53.520 --> 52:54.520
No, all the time.

52:54.520 --> 52:55.520
Don't put a nickel in him.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.520
Really?

52:56.520 --> 52:57.520
Every day he's like, I got to shoot his dogs.

52:57.520 --> 53:01.560
All the things you could shoot, you're going to shoot your two dogs.

53:01.560 --> 53:05.960
Well, I don't, I don't want to derail this, but like at the end of the world, if I'm about

53:05.960 --> 53:10.880
to kill myself, I don't want my dogs to, well, I guess they, I guess they could eat me.

53:10.880 --> 53:15.840
I guess I could leave them to eat me and they'd have a couple days of ground chuck to have

53:15.840 --> 53:20.720
fun with, but like, I was just thinking like, I'll just kill, you know, everybody that

53:20.720 --> 53:21.720
loves me.

53:21.720 --> 53:22.720
That needed context.

53:22.720 --> 53:24.920
But, but no, it's not for suicide.

53:24.920 --> 53:30.640
It's for, it was for the gun, the gun was definitely overall the most accurate description

53:30.640 --> 53:35.400
of it, which is my new favorite phrase because it was just like, holy shit, what a wake up

53:35.400 --> 53:37.520
of like, like white fragility.

53:37.520 --> 53:44.400
It was like, I have never had this level of experience, unlike basically all women, all

53:44.400 --> 53:51.320
people of color, all people of any identifiable demographic as vanilla man with, well, I thought

53:51.320 --> 53:53.920
I was an underdog and I thought I was badass.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.320
I thought I was punk rock.

53:55.320 --> 54:01.240
I thought I was an anarchist as in let's bring the anarchy like, like, like, and then like,

54:01.240 --> 54:07.640
I saw my girlfriend crying after an election and I was like, stop crying, you know, and

54:07.640 --> 54:14.280
like, and then the tears didn't stop crying and, and, and, and, and then the, and then

54:14.280 --> 54:17.960
the waitress came over and she had been crying and then the women were hugging and then,

54:17.960 --> 54:23.440
and I was like, and then I'm like talking to the other guys and going like, but then,

54:23.440 --> 54:26.280
but then I gotta shoot my dogs.

54:26.280 --> 54:30.920
I gotta go right now and shoot my dogs.

54:30.920 --> 54:35.120
Now we've come back to, I'm convinced of it again, like I'm back to like, yeah, it's

54:35.120 --> 54:40.560
happening again, but, but in the days after the election, I was like, this is happening

54:40.560 --> 54:49.640
fast and by this, I mean unidentifiable total destabilization, like how hard is it going

54:49.640 --> 54:57.840
to be for a guy that can, um, uh, the first guy to go out of business in Las Vegas owning

54:57.840 --> 55:03.560
a casino, um, like, like how hard is it going to be for this guy with an already unstable

55:03.560 --> 55:13.040
global, uh, economy to, to just like provoke a polarity shift that just crumbles everything.

55:13.040 --> 55:17.640
I didn't even think at the time of like, oh, you know, these races are going to start

55:17.640 --> 55:21.680
clockwork orging and then everyone's going to like it mad and now what I'm scared of

55:21.680 --> 55:25.680
is that the Mueller report is going to come out and it's like, we already know like he's

55:25.680 --> 55:31.000
got, it's going to be, he's a criminal and now we have a constitutional crisis and then

55:31.000 --> 55:36.160
it's going to be, I'm genuinely like, just a, just a fan theory, civil war is going to

55:36.160 --> 55:40.280
happen because like, there's going to be street to street, like fighting people going like,

55:40.280 --> 55:47.240
and so, but my, the reason I bought the gun is because I'm like, it's a power tool that

55:47.240 --> 55:55.680
I don't have that like a flashlight is for an earthquake and, um, and a, and a, and a,

55:55.680 --> 56:01.120
and a drill is for making a bird feeder and, and, and I don't have one of those things

56:01.120 --> 56:04.760
that knocks the people down that saw your sparklets bottles.

56:04.760 --> 56:09.320
Like, like I, that, that, that, that, if I didn't have a girlfriend, I don't know if

56:09.320 --> 56:12.440
I, because I'd be like, well, what am I, uh, uh, tech savory?

56:12.440 --> 56:17.160
I'm going to like, like, like enjoy protecting my empty gun with its last 11 bullets.

56:17.160 --> 56:20.720
I, I, you're going to draw a droopy dog.

56:20.720 --> 56:27.800
I, I, I, I, it's, it's a home invasion, uh, white fragility, like fear of impotence,

56:27.800 --> 56:33.920
like, like, like, like the worst death in the world would be not being able to protect

56:33.920 --> 56:34.920
my loved ones.

56:34.920 --> 56:35.920
Yeah.

56:35.920 --> 56:39.240
Like that's, and then it's like, there's this product and it's like, I'm exactly the

56:39.240 --> 56:40.240
part of the problem.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.240
That's why everyone has a gun.

56:42.240 --> 56:43.240
Yeah.

56:43.240 --> 56:49.520
I mean, I, I've, I remember right after the election and I was talking to my dad, like

56:49.520 --> 56:52.800
I was sobbing and I was talking to my dad, or I think it was a couple of days later,

56:52.800 --> 56:53.800
was probably still sobbing.

56:53.800 --> 56:58.440
And I asked how my grandmother was my 85 year old grandmother and he was like, she seems

56:58.440 --> 56:59.440
fine.

56:59.440 --> 57:05.920
And I was like, oh yeah, like she used to look like they used to just like black people

57:05.920 --> 57:09.200
walk down the street and then you just never saw them again.

57:09.200 --> 57:13.960
And so part of it was like when I, she, when I talked to her and she was like, yeah, no,

57:13.960 --> 57:14.960
I hate him.

57:14.960 --> 57:15.960
This is terrible.

57:15.960 --> 57:16.960
Also, she's like old.

57:16.960 --> 57:20.480
So at that point you're like, I don't know, whatever.

57:20.480 --> 57:25.160
She's like ice on a porch could be my Donald Trump.

57:25.160 --> 57:26.640
But I did think about that.

57:26.640 --> 57:31.240
I was like, you know, it's, it's been worse.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.680
So like there's that.

57:33.680 --> 57:37.720
But I've also had to like, I don't know, like I've had to really narrow the shit that I

57:37.720 --> 57:40.560
can like really, really care about because I feel like all this other stuff takes so

57:40.560 --> 57:45.120
much energy just to like absorb it and want it and like I don't want to ignore it.

57:45.120 --> 57:49.080
And so I've had to be like, there's like five things I can care about in a real way.

57:49.080 --> 57:52.440
And then I have to like pay attention to all this other shit because it feels necessary

57:52.440 --> 57:54.960
to pay attention because there's so much.

57:54.960 --> 57:59.760
And even now I'm like, I don't even, there's shit that I don't like names that I see and

57:59.760 --> 58:05.240
I don't really, I know that it's like a bad thing or there's a, you know, scandal, but

58:05.240 --> 58:07.200
I don't really know what it is.

58:07.200 --> 58:15.040
So as a millennial, I feel, I weirdly actually feel, I feel okay.

58:15.040 --> 58:21.080
But going into the midterms, I feel very like just just okay, though, like not on either

58:21.080 --> 58:25.080
side of it, just like really solidly okay.

58:25.080 --> 58:29.240
And I think it's just because like I have to feel okay, otherwise, like it's just because

58:29.240 --> 58:34.040
the alternative is going like, because I went through that phase where I was like, these

58:34.040 --> 58:38.840
guys are all acting like there aren't going to be free and fair elections in 2018.

58:38.840 --> 58:41.200
They still kind of are.

58:41.200 --> 58:43.640
But now it's, I mean, and I'm not, I'm not arguing.

58:43.640 --> 58:47.280
I'm not saying that I'm still willing to believe in the worst nightmare, but now there's this

58:47.280 --> 58:53.640
other theory because the behaviors become so incredibly like clownish that I'm like,

58:53.640 --> 58:58.960
oh, maybe they are just, they just thought they just, they're just dumb.

58:58.960 --> 59:02.480
Like I know they're, they were always dumb, but like not dumb and knew something that

59:02.480 --> 59:06.880
I didn't like, maybe they're just idiots.

59:06.880 --> 59:12.240
I think most of the people who knew stuff seem like they're kind of gone.

59:12.240 --> 59:14.840
Like it feels like mostly idiots left.

59:14.840 --> 59:15.840
Yeah.

59:15.840 --> 59:16.840
Yeah.

59:16.840 --> 59:21.600
And it's like the people that knew stuff were like, oh, this shit we knew, the jig is up.

59:21.600 --> 59:24.800
We can't leave a paper trail like, and he's just like, you're fired.

59:24.800 --> 59:25.800
You're fired.

59:25.800 --> 59:26.800
You're fired.

59:26.800 --> 59:31.480
And it's like, those are all the people that were like either a, just want to say, I don't,

59:31.480 --> 59:36.600
I think this might be illegal later and or the people that were like, we should do this

59:36.600 --> 59:37.600
illegal thing.

59:37.600 --> 59:40.960
Like both categories of people, that's a really interesting way of looking at it.

59:40.960 --> 59:46.200
Like he's like, he's just, but is that like, it's just this absurd thing about like, he's

59:46.200 --> 59:51.360
just like the, you're fired guy and now he's just, you're firing is like, could you become

59:51.360 --> 59:52.360
Caesar that way?

59:52.360 --> 59:57.720
Could you just fire every Roman senator and then fire the executive branch and fire the,

59:57.720 --> 59:58.720
oh wait, no, that's me.

59:58.720 --> 59:59.720
Okay.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.320
I'll hire, I'll promote the executive branch.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:06.320
I'm going to fire this, the fire, the constitution, like, is he just going to fire that?

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.640
I'm sure he, I bet you he thinks he can like fire a Supreme Court judge.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:16.240
Nothing is the only thing he's ever done that my dad would call running a business.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.160
Like my dad, who's like an actual businessman, like, like, I think, I bet that's the only

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:26.920
thing he's ever done that was like, I bet he's never filed taxes or like, cash to check

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:32.800
or like, put, balance the ledger or, or like looked at a pie chart, like, but he's just,

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.800
he's just fired people.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:39.840
He's just, he thinks it's just like, anyways, I think if, I think if we can, I think if

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.440
after the midterms, I don't feel like, I feel like talk to me again after that.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.440
Yeah.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.640
Because if, if I still feel this shitty, like next January, that it's like, and assuming

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:54.480
maybe we flipped things, then it's like, oh, we're super fucked.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.480
So, yeah.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.360
But you'll have made a lot of pasta by them.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.240
I've made a lot of pasta by them.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.240
I will.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.240
That's gotta be, you think that's a thing that's like a phenomenon in America is like,

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.040
people have these Trump hobbies, they're like, if it's going to be four years, I might as

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.720
well take up bonsai tree farming or like something.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.280
No, I think, and people gained a lot of weight apparently after the election.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.040
They were just like, I stayed home for weeks.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.040
Yeah.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.120
I put on a lot of weight.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.960
And then in 2018, and I was like, I'm going to start working out and also buying again.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.600
I think, I think absolutely, like everybody like, we're all going to, there's going to

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.560
be like some equivalent of the baby boom, but instead of just being a population explosion,

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.640
it's going to be like a weird hobby explosion.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:38.360
Like, like, how come there's so many more stamp collectors that are aged 40 in 2030?

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:42.920
Well, because it traces back to this panic people had that they were missing out on the

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.520
smaller things in life.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.840
All these CrossFit gyms, like every day I've seen in one of those.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.760
That's probably the response.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.760
Yeah.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.360
I mean, there seems, I don't know, the people I know that go to gyms say that the drop off

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.640
that happens at the beginning of the year hasn't really happened so far, which is interesting.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.640
I don't know.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.640
Do you want to meet my black friend that has your last name?

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.640
Oh yeah.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.640
I might know him.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640
Oh yeah.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.640
Did you, did you meet him before the show?

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:12.560
No, I just, you know, we, you guys all know each other because you know, it's funny.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.560
You know, it's shitty.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560
Okay.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.760
I'm going to say this because like we don't all black people don't, but it's hard because

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.400
like in Hollywood, I'm learning like I have met.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:27.360
I'm going to say probably 60% well in Hollywood, and I haven't even been doing it that long.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.000
I mean, just because there's not that many.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.560
And so it's one of those things where I'm like, yeah, I do know that person and I don't want

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.360
to tell you that because you're asking me for that.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.680
I have that conversation constantly now because I'm not all, it's, it's almost like a social

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.680
customer.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:47.160
I'm not allowed to, I have to, I go like, oh, Asian person, do you know Randall Park?

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.920
And they're like, of course I know Randall Park.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.920
I figured you did, but I'm not allowed to.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:51.920
Right.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.920
All right.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.760
Well, let's bring up DeMorge Brown.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:09.640
No relation to the M.O.R.G.E.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:26.240
DeMorge Brown, sitting down to the M.O.R.G.E., sitting, that was me, DeMorge, that was great.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.240
The blood is in the water.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.200
Keep your freestyles short, like little, little punctuations and you'll, you'll like, you'll

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.200
get through them.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.200
What's going on?

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.200
I'm all right.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.200
What the?

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.200
Yeah.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.320
What else was Mayville like?

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.320
Anything new?

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.520
Uh, not a single, just working, working, working, working, working.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.320
We don't know each other, by the way.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.320
Okay.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.320
We don't know each other.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.320
Do you?

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.320
But now we do, so.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320
Yeah.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.320
Uh-oh.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.320
Do you want to, do you want to share any of your work?

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:58.400
Uh, my stuff, personally, I'm just still writing really weird sort of shorts.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.600
Um, it's a weird thing where it's like Fela Kuti at a, uh, children's show, and it's

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.040
a cold open of the cold, uh, of the show, so it's a puppet in Fela Kuti.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.360
So that's a thing.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.360
Something you're writing on spec?

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.360
Uh, no, no.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360
It's just my thing.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:17.520
It's just part of my sort of ongoing, ongoing sort of realm of shorts that are ideas I want

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.880
to see executed that nobody ever.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.440
Do you write every day?

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.520
Do you get up at like a certain, uh, and get right to it or?

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:29.120
Uh, it's, every day is different for me, so like, uh, but at some point every day I sit

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.760
down and, uh, write in some form.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.200
I mean, yeah, absolutely.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.200
Me too.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.200
Every day.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.200
Every day.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.200
Stephen King.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.280
I, that's what they call me.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.320
You know that motherfucker writes every day.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.320
I read on writing, that's why I know.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.320
Somebody told me something.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:53.080
I think it was, I think it was my partner in my other podcast, uh, uh, uh, Jessica Gow.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.880
She quoted something from that book that I thought was really profound and that I immediately

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:02.540
forgot, but it sounds like that's, that's the first time I've heard somebody like,

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:06.680
uh, like, yeah, Stephen King's on writing sounds like an inspirational book.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.020
operational, you know, he almost died. I didn't know that. Yeah.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.020
It's crazy. I

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:16.080
I had a girlfriend in Milwaukee who

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:21.180
Bragged to me that she went out to his place one time and stole one of his gargoyles

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:26.060
And I thought to this day like when I see him on Twitter after I feel like should I tell him?

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:30.700
Because it's like the world changed like back in Milwaukee in the 90s

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.220
It was like ha Stephen King

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:38.180
It's a guy's names on a book on your bookshelf and you stole his gargoyle and that is like the world just like Tesseracted

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:43.980
And and now he's just there if I mentioned him he might go I like Rick and Morty. I'm like my girlfriend still your gargoyle

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:52.040
You should tell him you gotta tell I don't know it's it's not my piece to make though it is I didn't do anything

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:56.200
What if you're telling him right now ladies and gentlemen? I

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.240
Love Rick and Morty

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:08.640
Do you read a lot of fiction? Do you I do I've I have gone back to reading a lot of fiction because I find that

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.880
writing is much easier for me when I'm reading something like I

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.920
Even like a couple months ago

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:20.160
I was just having a hard time like getting words down and I realized I hadn't read a book in like a month or something like that

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.680
So I have and I'm not working technically so I got a lot of time

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:28.280
I used to read mostly nonfiction though, but I'm back to fiction. So I

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:34.480
I don't read anything. Yeah, I can't even read if I I can't it's like it's that Twitter thing

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:39.080
I can't read anything longer than a bumper sticker anymore like my brain. Oh my god

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.040
That's bumpy burger executives are

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:55.160
Happened we'll find out what's going on. What happened? We're gonna conduct the thorough internal review. Did anybody see what happened? I

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.640
think it was

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.080
Yeah

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.240
Hmm fucking gel clips

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.160
Well, the heavier things are mounted very securely. Okay, um

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:10.800
To mortgage are you or how are you emotionally and spiritually and I'm good. I'm good

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:19.440
Exhausted but put a lot of pressure on myself this year to kind of like crack something open and make something happen in this town, but I

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.960
Can I help it anyway? I

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:29.820
I suppose I mean, it's your choice. Well, I don't know like yeah, I don't I don't know the answer either

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I just I mean all you can do is be who you are and do what you're doing

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:43.560
What else you're supposed to do, you know, yeah, that's that was either the royal you like like everybody can either condense it

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.560
Or that was that you do you Harmon?

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.080
I don't have

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.160
I don't know. I don't know if you saw the headlines but Rick and Morty's and limbo

01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:01.960
Um, I didn't see the headlines. What do they say in limbo? It's not in limbo. It's there where is a negotiator?

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.960
Negotiating a contract and I so I still negotiating

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:10.280
I said to the five thousandth kid that tweeted me. Hey, you fat lazy alcoholics stop

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:16.000
Being so slow writing the scripts like because they're 15 and they I understand that they don't know how TV works

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.040
I just don't understand why they're so horrible. Why are they so mean?

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:27.080
Why are they so there's not you can't when when community fans would go? I'm upset right now because

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.460
Annie kissed Jeff instead of bread. I would go

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:37.120
First of all, you're you're crazy because you're upset with me and their fictional characters

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:41.720
But second of all, that's how I feel about TV to thank you for the biggest compliment in the world

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:48.120
Which is total immersion in my narrative and I get it. I understand the the compliment on this. I get it

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.640
These kids that are like like

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.800
I ain't a cupcake today and they're like

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.840
Why don't you fucking stop eating cupcakes and write the fucking show you piece of shit and it's like what?

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:06.880
We skipped the part where you like it even like it's crazy. Clearly you do or is there a

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.920
world

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.600
Where?

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.600
That would work

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:19.560
Like a kid would go will you stop eating cupcakes and you'd write the script and you read

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.480
No, it's just so even though it hasn't been ordered by the network

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.760
Which is why now the trades because now I yelled at a 15 year old like it hasn't been ordered

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.520
And then so now it's like I just I can see on this

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:36.560
the absolute vodka sponsored sidebars of like the websites where I've tried to trying to like

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:43.720
Procrast and it's like I just I see like my name and I see Rick and Morty thumbnails. I'm like, ah, you did it again

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.520
and but but like

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:54.760
Yeah, is there a universe where a kid saying that would make me write a season of Rick and Morty by myself

01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:01.520
Without getting together with Justin. Oh Justin. Okay, Justin. I'm gonna. I'm just you know what this is taking so long

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.400
I'm gonna just start writing the show because you're gonna have to write it. Anyway, right exactly

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:09.720
And eventually we'll still have a head start fade in Rick's like I love inventing stuff

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.380
And I was like like like yeah, no, I don't I don't see

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.400
If there was a world where that was going to happen

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:22.160
I think maybe the kid would be saying something along the lines of I have Lou Gehrig's disease

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:27.520
And I'd love to see a script of Rick and Morty before I die and obviously that's not good

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.200
I'm not gonna get to see the show

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.920
Maybe not hey you piece of shit

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:37.760
Your fat this is why your wife left you like like they dig into my personal life

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:45.240
Yeah, and I'm like like you don't know how TV works and you don't know what this is good

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.680
You're 15

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:52.480
So you're supposed to be dumb, but you're not supposed to have this hubris. This is dangerous

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.840
I guess this is what all old people have said about young people forever internet people are scary though

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:02.840
We used to get crazy emails at Jezebel like every day. It was like well Jezebel terrified me like it's yeah

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.840
I mean like I can't imagine the

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.360
People are very bold. That's cuz you know, you got to like offer to meet them

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:14.880
Spencer's Spencer's way of putting it which I thought was very accurate because it kind of like it's like the internet has stripped

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:20.740
Shame from the species and that has resulted in amazing things like

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:28.460
a foot that and evil things like it has you you can now I did focus and comfort groups for like people with leprosy and

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:37.260
Stuff like very serious things like you know that people have had to live in isolation from and had terrible stigma

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:45.780
How could you successfully have raised your consciousness without the internet when the very thing about it that that is used to oppress is that is

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.100
That there's not strengthened numbers

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:51.660
There's not like you know, you're not gonna have a million transgender march and probably people will yell at me for that

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:58.580
But but but I just I mean that in a in a way of saying like like we shouldn't have to wait for that and like like it's like

01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:03.460
It's that's how amazing the internet is is that we can go. Oh, there's there's it doesn't matter

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:08.880
It doesn't it doesn't have to be mob rule or anything, but it's like and then the fucking exact same thing happened with

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.140
Nazis, they're just like, oh, yeah, yeah, no shame like like

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:17.460
No, no, yeah, like totally like I shame it. There's also like an like an invitation to

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.220
to this myth that like that your

01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:24.900
Your every thought is an opinion and every opinion

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:29.420
Matters and should be because there's always a cursor. It just it became free

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:34.100
it went from being this expensive technology that Gutenberg developed on the side of cocoon and

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:41.180
And my references are getting so older than the first Gutenberg

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:49.700
Like like yeah, it was it was like lasers to have to print a newspaper or leave a comment on something and then it became like

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:53.700
Anything to say in this Farmville move. Yeah

01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:57.700
People well, there you go. It's now it's in Farmville font

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:05.340
Remember back in the comic book days where people would snail mail the shit that you get comments on now

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:10.260
Like we would get in Milwaukee. Somebody went. Hmm. I'm gonna write

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.620
I was wondering why I would take pen to paper under such circumstances

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:19.660
However, it's me to make a bit of an introduction. First of all a few words about myself

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:26.940
I am a what they call a militant virgin. I am proud to say your comic book has given me very much guidance through this

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:30.740
However, I object to the principles at hand. No second of all in regards to issue three

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:34.820
Yeah, and they would just it would have us you'd have to put a stamp on it walk to the mill

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:39.220
That person had to have to need to put cardio into their fucking parasitism

01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:47.660
There's an entitlement thing too because I find that if like if I tweet something and then someone responds back with some bullshit

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:52.060
And I'm like, I wasn't asking you a fucking question and they're like wasn't want to tweet it

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:56.580
I'm like just because I tweet something is not an invitation for your dumbass opinions

01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:01.060
And they think that just putting anything out there is like now I get to respond to it

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:07.420
And it's you like I have the right to and you have to respond to me and if you didn't want people to like

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:12.420
Comment you about it. You shouldn't have said it and it's like nobody's talking to you. Yeah, it's not a conversation

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.260
I'm not having conversation with any of you people

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.900
Yeah

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:25.260
I mean like every once in a while and this is a fun way to use Twitter every once in a while I'll go like hey

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:30.640
I need shorts, you know like anybody got any or I found a drone in my yard

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.980
Does anyone know who's it is and like the internet snaps as it's like, yeah

01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:40.500
There's very specific points when as a primate you could recognize when someone wants information from you and it if we keep

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.700
Defining it as when a cursor is blinking underneath what they're saying. We're going to die

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:49.660
Right well, that's the problem is because that our behavior in is shaped by

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:55.980
Technology and the options it kind of conveys because it's like we can obviously do a million things

01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:02.540
But internet's and websites they present a number of options and so they limit it and so you're not thinking oh

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:07.780
Commenting is not something I have to worry about but then it gives you an option

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.180
It's like would you like to comment?

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:11.740
This is something you should consider doing and it's like well

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:15.980
No, you should have considered commenting every time you see a box that says comment that would be absurd

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.980
Well, I don't know if they ever

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:25.200
Like like I noticed that the people they're writing for online publications and stuff they

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:32.700
They started having to put in there like TV reviews and stuff like like they they they have to end their paragraph with like

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.020
Did you think?

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.020
Yeah

01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:48.660
No, don't don't tell them they need to be ashamed. Yeah, I did not I did not like the comments. I know I I

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.660
Like the just any benefit

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:57.140
I mean it was nice when people like stuff and sometimes people gave you corrections and sometimes it was helpful

01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:03.360
but like it the negative far outweighed any of the positive and like it was always this thing of like

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:10.760
professionalism like if we if they would like people would comment stuff on on articles and they'd be just smart asses and

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:16.040
Then we would respond back like smart asses because you're right came in being a dick and like I can be a dick, too

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.520
And then they're like well, this is really unprofessional

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.400
Right, it's like you just call like you just call me stupid also

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.280
I don't work for or with you and this is not a service

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.200
So there's no professionalism

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:34.240
I had you and I because we're like I it's me and my co-workers and I'm not providing a service to you

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:40.960
We're just putting the shit out there and you're choosing to read it and like I just if we could have every day

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:45.640
I would ask our editor like it became a joke or as like can we can we get rid of the comments today?

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:53.040
No, if we get rid of the comment section, then we're competing with websites that have comment sections and there's a certain I don't know

01:16:53.040 --> 01:17:00.360
Who the fuck these people are but there's there a sizable percentage of the audience that like

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.200
They like to comment

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.640
Yeah, so if Jezebel removes their comment section and Hezebel doesn't Hezebel

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:14.520
I guess gets that 10% 20% of readers and it's so we're terrified, but then and I just

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.120
Man, I mean this is how like

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:29.120
Journalism seeing the internet and going what do we do is is is is the whole reason why we're in everything now because instead of going

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.120
we need to double down on

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:41.120
Journalistic standards and like basically elitism because I'm sure we sound like elitist right now to somebody who's like I leave a lot of comments

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.120
What makes you so better aren't you?

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:49.440
Doesn't isn't Kara's job to comment on society and then I leave a comment under her comment on culture and like now

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.320
I'm an asshole because I'm just a plebe. Well, I

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.920
Guess part of me wants to just go. Yeah, let's end that argument

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:03.880
You are a plebe like you're you're you're fucking thought process is horrible like you didn't you didn't want to spend any more than the three

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.520
Hours it took you to write these two paragraphs about like how she's technically being unfair

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:16.440
It's like you're you're not you don't you don't really hurt as much for this as as as the person you're commenting on does so

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.440
Yeah, elitism, I guess

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.120
But like they're doing work

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:28.240
You commenting isn't like it. It wasn't it's not like it just came to mind. It's like I wrote something

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.840
I spent time on it someone else read it. It was checked like I was doing I was doing something

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:39.560
Yeah, but even but you and I agree that even on Twitter where we're not doing work if I'm just like hey

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.560
I don't like I don't like banana splits

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.680
Here's the here's the here's the replies I enjoyed

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.840
a

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:56.160
Smart fun person saying like banana splits are the are the blank of blank like like maybe it's a swing and a miss

01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:02.280
But it's like they tried and it's like they're they're yes, ending. They're go there. You know, they're not here's the ones I don't like

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.280
Uh

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.520
They're they're technically not banana splits. That's a fallacy or whatever the file

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:16.800
I'm gonna split at the other place or like or like just repeating the joke like like I can't give an example of that because bananas

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.080
I don't like banana splits isn't a joke

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:24.080
But but like they were they just like repeat it and it's like it makes you wonder if like they knew

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.760
Like so, what do you think I am? Do you think I'm just a guy just like making noise?

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:32.880
It's a year and now you're making it just it did I just I and I put a flow chart

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.880
I pinned it to my Twitter profile. I

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.720
Graffted out where you can walk through it if you read a tweet

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:47.040
You can walk through the flow chart when deciding whether or not you should reply and it's it's pretty it's pretty well thought out

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:50.720
If I give if I do say so myself, how long did it take you to make the flow chart?

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.860
I'm not gonna comment on that until I turn the script in

01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:58.300
The but it's like and then I posted it. I was like, there we go

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:03.340
So, you know, that's good then then like I don't have to get mad at people anymore because I can even if anything

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.140
I can just reprint the flow chart

01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:07.620
everybody looked at the flow chart and because I they like

01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.260
80% of the people were like

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.900
ha oh

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.980
How do you know when you finish or?

01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:18.500
Like they were like they thought it was a board game or

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:23.420
They thought it was like a flow chart of whether or not I will respond to their tweet

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:26.700
This is this is so there used to be in my opinion

01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:32.420
There used to be a gear of hesitation in that so shame see something

01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:39.980
Yeah, shame or what I like I don't but there's a fear of being expelled from the fig tree of monkeys because you suck

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.620
fear of that

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:45.260
Reflex and the opinion are not the same thing

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:48.660
so you have a reflexive action or response to something and

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:55.060
Your first was you're there used to be a check that sort of said alright. Let me just be ashamed

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.860
For just a second away. Let this have let this opinion form

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:03.260
Let me think about what and then if it if it became something that you had solidified

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.980
You could you would post that if it was if there was enough base

01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:10.940
But now overcome the shame acid you had a milkshake. Yeah, that's sort of gag reflex is gone

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:13.580
And now people just kind of go out like that right away

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:20.100
Yeah, here's something that I is in my head and and it's like I and and and and you could never again

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:26.100
You can't say to the person like well, you don't even know how to spell and you're like yelling at me

01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:32.100
That's the long gone. We're in the middle of an anti-intellectual revolution. The president is like I

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:39.380
Spells cats dogs people don't read anything also is something I've learned because I would get

01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:44.460
Comments and it's like they're commenting on something. I'm like it is literally in the thing

01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:48.380
I just wrote right you made it halfway through and then you got pissy

01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.380
And then you went in and left a comment

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:55.500
And if you would just finished reading the fucking article the exact thing question that you have was answered

01:21:55.500 --> 01:22:01.100
And I mean even with Twitter, I feel like people like I'll get responses. I'm like, are you understanding what I just said

01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:04.260
I don't think you're understanding this or you're not reading this clearly

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:10.620
People and that irony is that underneath it all people just want to be heard and connect but they can't then turn that into empathy and go

01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:17.660
Oh, I guess that's how everyone feels so maybe don't like go into this YouTube video of someone's daughter doing ballet and go

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:22.900
She looks a little fat like like like like because the reason you're saying that is that's your pirouette

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:30.380
Like that's you wanting praise on a YouTube video from your dad that doesn't exist and it's like it's insane that you can't

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:37.340
It like we're anyways, well, let's do this to save save save save you guys from my maelstrom

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:42.140
What's what's good about the modern world? What's what do we like about it?

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:44.860
Used to be worse in some ways

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:50.020
Yeah, you see those those beer bottles that the mountain turns blue if it's cold

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.940
Holy shit

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:59.740
That's the perfect temperature to drink beer what is really my therapist always makes me do this like what's good

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:04.100
What's good? What is good? Even if it's just in your personal life like oh, well, you're you're easy

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:08.340
You're on a fucking streak. That's good. You don't even give a shit about us

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:12.700
You just think you're like I wonder if I get a parking space next

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:21.420
No, I mean, it's I think I have to remember that at least

01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:28.940
For a black person. It's better to be alive anytime in the future than in the past, right?

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:37.220
I'm most likely so it's better now than to 20 years ago. So I guess there's that

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:45.820
Yeah, like it it's yeah, yeah, it's hard not to be positive about it because

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:51.980
You can't be nostalgic about it. No, still not great. Yeah. No, but I it's like I would rather be alive

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:55.220
Now then 60 years ago

01:23:55.220 --> 01:24:00.180
but I think it went along those lines one of the things is that the representations of

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:05.460
What we see are more specific now because you can't

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:12.500
Hide behind this idea that oh people only want to see this type of family on TV or that kind of thing

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.260
So you're talking about the huckstables and that was for me

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:17.620
That was like one of the first times that I saw situations

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:21.940
That were reflective of my own life and people would come up and say well

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:28.620
It's not it's not a real family or it's not of this or it's not of that but I know plenty of families through my parents and through my

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:34.340
You know other just circles where black lawyer black doctor black, whatever black black reels or black, whatever

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:42.700
Who had friends and had the best parts for me of the cost which was would be at the end when the guest star would have been a

01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:49.980
A a musician of amazing note, but that I didn't know

01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:53.660
I didn't know who Betty Carter was until that episode where she came in it

01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:58.220
They give her ten minutes at the end of the show to sing a song as part of the narrative that kind of stuff

01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:01.540
And so for me as a kid I go I don't know who that is but that song is amazing

01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:05.260
Wait for the credits to roll write the name down go to the library right after that

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:13.260
Realize who this woman is and and how amazing she was and that show just had constantly had that kind of stuff

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.220
And then so I think that now what's happening is

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.500
So much stuff is happening so much

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:24.660
faster and you have kids whose vision of the world is is

01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:34.940
Several increments faster than the people who are trying to create entertainment for them because of it now people are trying to match up with

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.940
these kids in the way that they see the world and

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:42.540
The internet is one way that you see that I mean you have to kind of if we can last

01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:47.620
Another 30 years we have we are living through a tipping point where the syndrome

01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:51.820
That we've been grappling with will will have been overcome

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:58.940
Right like we can all agree on that it's just but now it's a question ironically if we if we are here in 30 years

01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:00.940
If we could have what we have today plus

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.580
now now that we got

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:09.380
Now that we got a Shonda and then therefore are gonna have the 10 Shonda imitators and the

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:11.540
500 like Shonda

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:15.900
Inspire ease and and the and the blah blah blah like not just confining it to that topic

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:21.860
But keeping it on theme for this episode, but like like it that plus 20 years equals boom

01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:23.860
I think we're done and

01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:31.380
But but the it's is that why so we're it's like we're having a fever because we're like we're like it's getting too close to that

01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:34.060
It's I like like I don't I don't like all this talk about

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:39.220
Like I don't I keep hearing that I'm white and I just don't like it and it's like making me uncomfortable

01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:44.500
Like I'd never heard that before it's like what do you mean? I'm bad. I don't know what that means like I've

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.220
Haven't been called white outside of like a Richard Pryor album in like

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:55.500
And and like so like we're then it's America is just like it's having this seismic fucking conniption fit

01:26:55.900 --> 01:27:00.700
Precisely because things because we're in the bubble right now because things are almost there

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.700
You we're in a place now where you can't

01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:07.220
It's a lot harder to walk around and go like I don't know what that is or I don't know what that term is

01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:09.700
So everything is changing so fast and they just throw in these words

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:15.940
Well, you now have to learn the vocabulary people are learning that there is a place for themselves and in this world

01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:21.900
And they're choosing their own definitions and then they're forcing you to learn the label because what I'm excited about which I don't think other white

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:30.300
People understand about as far as changing times under our feet is that if you if it feels like a conveyor belt is making you go like this

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:35.140
Like yeah, your first instinct is something's going wrong. Stop it from happening

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:39.820
But much like with mp3 technology or anything else that is just gonna happen

01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:47.860
This second thing that happens is you now have an unprecedented license to be even more relaxed than you've ever been

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:54.100
Like you can now like pretty soon if this nightmare that you're worried about where white people are somehow

01:27:54.100 --> 01:28:02.300
Just other people like like like or and that they're always wrong or there was like you can now be you could just go like

01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:07.300
Yeah, I don't know like like which is like a fun. I like like I don't know what I'm doing

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:09.300
I don't know. Is that what you call that?

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:12.620
form of of of of

01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:18.900
Social custom I certainly wasn't trying to offend anybody. I don't know what the fuck is going on. I'm just white, right?

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:24.700
I'm fucking idiot like isn't that a luxury? Isn't that fun? Like that's like being in a cruise ship. Excuse me

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:29.500
Where's the bathroom? I just took a shit over the rail. I don't know you tell me I'm just here

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:33.980
I'm just old and dying on a boat. I guess I don't know why I'm like looking at you guys like right, right?

01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:37.460
It's like I have the wrong panel for this. I just have like business as usual

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:45.580
I think you know what I do think though. I think I think white people just also maybe need to relax a little bit

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:51.220
Like it'll be fine. Do we get to now? It'll be fine. It's like not invited to the conversation

01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:55.580
I don't have to care about Black Panther. Isn't that isn't that fun? Yeah, it's fine

01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:00.700
You don't have to you can't you can't you can't make or break a Marvel movie with your Rotten Tomatoes review

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:05.460
Isn't isn't that nice? You can take the day off. You don't have to just care

01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:07.900
as I guess I'm flaunting my

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.380
my my advantage of

01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:16.340
Listening to Jessica gow for for however many episodes have been doing that show because I guess it's like that

01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:20.620
That had to really be drilled into me because I was like like we're talking about the Confederate thing and I was like

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:25.220
I'm still like what about ink and like like yeah, but we haven't seen the show or it's like isn't this a slippery slope?

01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:33.060
I don't get it and and and but and then at some point I like like I had like this kind of fit of like since we were like

01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:35.060
This disconnect and I was like, yeah, but Jessica

01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:40.020
I feel like I feel like I'm Optimus Prime and all the Autobots are coming to me and saying like you're

01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:43.680
Optimus Prime and you're in charge, but we hate you for being in charge and we

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:48.660
We what we want you to stop doing things, but we want you to start doing things different all this stuff

01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:50.420
And she's like no one said you were Optimus Prime

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:57.740
It turned into this like really weird like moment where I was like wait, so I don't have to have an opinion about

01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.700
Confederate yeah, and she's like no

01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:07.580
Your opinion about it. I'm like but and I'm thinking in my head, but but yeah, I'm like

01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:11.420
Yeah, good. I don't want to have one. It sounds like a really sticky situation

01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:18.980
Look at my twinkie and eat it like like what a fucking amazing. I just gained five hours of my work week

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:25.740
I don't I don't have to sound off about fucking Confederate and whether it like and I can't you apply that to everything?

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:30.900
America can't you like can't you stop fucking commenting on everything?

01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:40.340
Okay, you're not you don't need your feedback is not going to make a difference. It's not going to get you a job

01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:43.460
It's not going to keep anything bad from happening

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:49.060
You are dumb and you're gonna stay dumb and if you're poor

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:53.660
You should you should do something that makes money and commenting isn't one of them

01:30:53.660 --> 01:31:01.140
and if you're rich, then you're gonna you're you're losing money commenting and you're if I mentioned you're stupid and

01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:04.180
and and no one cares and

01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:09.420
Check out the flow chart. Yeah. Yeah, just go look at my flow chart. Let's look at the flow chart

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:12.340
All right get caught in a loop

01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:14.420
Did we did we fill our?

01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:18.340
Didn't you promise him two minutes of bumpies? Oh, yeah

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:23.420
Well, yes, he yes, he did promise that I gave it to him like my iPad and he didn't

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:31.420
How are the fries at bumpies? I like french fries. No, but were they what kind of fries were they?

01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:38.940
They were French like the thin ones. They were thin. They were thin wait, you know, it's been a long time. Okay, so I

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:44.060
Bet you they were thin fries. Hmm. I like the French fries

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:49.340
I'm up. I love french fries. Do you like bumpy burger more than McDonald's?

01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:53.260
Yeah, because I drew a logo for it and

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:56.520
I want a competition. Hmm. Oh

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:03.980
How come they didn't put it on a billboard outside of town they they didn't put it on a billboard, but they put it on their menu

01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:11.340
Oh, that's pretty cool. That is cool. Yeah, that was worth it. Wasn't it? Yeah, and we still got a minute left

01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:17.260
Did we really talk for two hours? No, I just mean to have covered two minutes of bumpy burgers

01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.860
Oh, I

01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:22.100
Mean no one said the podcast has to be two hours. Also. What's I know?

01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:27.860
No, no one ever is as ever said that and most people are like stop making the podcast two hours

01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:30.100
Really? You read that stuff. Yeah, I'm at work

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:34.260
I'm already at work and I want to press I got a press pause. Yeah

01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:37.940
Yeah, and that's when we played Dungeons and Dragons and so we're not gonna play it this way

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:41.620
And people are always like that's the worst part of the show Spencer hates himself

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:47.180
I don't know why he keeps showing up. It seems like he wants to kill himself. It seems like every time I see Spencer

01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:51.540
He's gonna kill himself. I don't know why Spencer hates himself so much and everything he does

01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:56.060
So maybe that also happens because the show goes on so long

01:32:56.460 --> 01:33:00.860
Must be nice to be able to read about yourself on the internet without killing yourself. Oh, it's great

01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:04.100
I'm I I've yeah, it's great. I

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:10.180
I definitely want typing Dan Harmon into Google and seeing what the autofill says

01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:12.180
I know you have

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:18.860
I mean the last time I did was like eight years ago and it was definitely like Dan

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:21.300
I was like Chevy Chase Dan Armand Chevy Chase all this stuff

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:25.420
Chevy's pissed at me. Oh

01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:32.300
A lot of people yeah, but he was we were friends and I considered that an accomplishment because I was an asshole to him by

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:35.460
Doing that voicemail thing and I felt like I was mature and then

01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:39.620
That article came out with that was about the feature on Donald

01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:44.860
Like I had a quote in there that and I was like it was like right on the heels of me like

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:49.220
I really nice conversation with Chevy and he was like he won't he hasn't talked to me since

01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:55.700
What what well, I don't I mean what did you do now? What did you do?

01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:56.860
What do you do now?

01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:03.020
He said what would the article said that like Chevy recognized Donald's talent and stuff like that, right? And I never and it said

01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:07.420
I mean they honestly like all due respect to the writer who wrote a really incredible piece on Donald

01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:08.660
So I know he must be a good guy

01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:13.620
But like I did have two conversations with him on the phone where I was like very adamant about how I did not want to

01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:20.340
Dog pile Chevy and was really worried about this quote and he it really was kind of assembled out of like weird like I

01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:27.540
I would never ever use the word jealous in reference to an actor because I know that that would it's it's

01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:32.860
It's I just know that that's like the J word like you don't say yeah

01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:36.460
So-and-so was jealous of so-and-so like especially about actors

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:41.380
And I and I just like it's just like whatever

01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:47.860
Just thought I had my second I'm a bad interviewer drink and now I'm now I'm in therapy

01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:51.100
Does this mean I'm not gonna get my script on oh?

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:54.580
Damn, then I get to be miserable for another week

01:34:55.780 --> 01:35:03.900
Thanks, Levy. Yeah, Steve's traditionally right in these scenarios. Are you in love Kara Kara? Not with me the Netflix series

01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:08.980
No, no relationship. Is that is that is that bad form?

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:12.060
What's going on with you sexually?

01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:17.940
Well, you said it normal. Yeah, and then I and then you made it weird

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.820
What's going on with you sexually?

01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:25.420
Well, I got as close as I could I said emotionally for tomorrow's is like what's going on to Marge

01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:29.100
No, I don't know if you have you L.A.'s weird

01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:36.780
Always weird. That's where you're gonna meet like the coolest person in the world. Yeah. Yeah, I would rather I would rather have

01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:38.700
a

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.020
Good script than a boyfriend right now. I

01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.020
think that's what

01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:46.740
Because one could do a lot for me

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:52.900
I heard one light clapping from the back of the warehouse. I think your publicist is here

01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.660
Yes work all

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.580
Yeah, well, that's your you're you're probably

01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:05.740
19 I'm not gonna ask you don't don't don't rush it

01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:08.700
Are you gonna ask?

01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:11.940
No, no, oh if you want to know how old Cara Brown is

01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:20.260
Go research her and in the process read some of her amazing little thought pieces on

01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:24.580
On our website, which is really easy to remember K. A. R. A

01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:27.060
Brown calm

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:31.180
But she doesn't even need you to go there anymore because she's departed from that world

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:34.860
She doesn't she thinks that the internet is a bunch of

01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:43.100
Shit heads like I do Schrab you got anything to plug you want to borrow you're gonna be borrowing iPads anywhere in the neighborhood

01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:45.100
I hate you

01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:52.380
Are you enjoying the iPad can you at least give us an update? I haven't I haven't used it since I brought it

01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:54.380
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:57.020
What

01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:02.740
No, I you haven't used it. I kind of used it and then I don't know I

01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:08.700
I I don't know how many times we have to discuss this what this is insane

01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:13.900
Why is it insane? I got I gave I let him

01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:18.140
Borrow an iPad Pro because he wanted to see how it worked

01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:24.620
Yeah, and then he came in the podcast and told a story about how me doing that made him feel bad and then I

01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:30.540
Felt bad about using it. Oh, and so you're just keeping it on a shelf

01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:32.540
To make things better

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:34.180
No

01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:40.460
Do you have to give it back? Does he have to give it back? He needs it so badly because he he needs two of them

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:42.980
He needs it so badly

01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:48.460
He's it's so badly. Did you take it to even the score are you Robin Hood? No, no, I

01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:51.140
it's I

01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:59.260
Look at all things creative right now is just like a wait. It's um, you know, we've talked about this

01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:01.260
Yeah, I

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:06.700
Was hoping that it would inspire me and it didn't yeah, so we'll give it back

01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:10.940
I told you last week. I'd give it back. That's how most iPad purchasers feel

01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:16.340
I think they get the they get the pencil that's really a hundred dollar pencil. Well, it's worth it because

01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:23.380
Finally the reason I wanted you know, but I just I don't have anything that makes me want to draw right now

01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:30.580
I mean unless you have something like that, you should redraw those drawings that you're posting from when you're a kid

01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:37.300
Remember those are really cool. You know those are better than anything anyone's ever drawn

01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.620
Thanks, yeah

01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:49.300
I think I'm of the opinion that you should just take it easy and let yourself I have been I have been

01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:56.660
I'm sorry, do you deal with you're too young? You've never done I'm not gonna ask but you've never dealt with

01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:01.420
like oh god Rob your your your your

01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:08.300
Do you have do you have germination phases where you're like? I'm done. I'm out of ideas or something. Yeah, I just I can't work

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:15.540
I'm desiccated them. I will say one of the things the internet a good thing about the internet was that we were writing

01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:20.860
I was writing every yeah a lot of foreign into a deadline. Yeah, one of the deadline in your hand

01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:26.260
Yeah, so I do like it. I think of it very much as like oh, this is my job

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:30.980
My job is writing and so I have to do my job and so yeah use

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:39.260
Use all right. Well, I wish I have anything to plug don't high road me. I wasn't

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.440
Demorige, I know you have anything to plug

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.120
I

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.960
Don't a live show at the Lyric Hyperion with Anna Sergeina and wit Thomas and they've sort of

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:57.040
Come up with these personas who are poets and they're gonna do it straight as I was a almost like a straight poetry reading or something

01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:01.160
And then they came to me and said we want you to be the person who curates the event

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:07.360
We're not gonna tell you what to do you just do whatever so I'm this character that I've sort of been creating over the last couple months

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:13.640
Named Ephraim Elizabeth King is sort of like a composite of any writing and structure. I had and in college

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:19.320
That's we've never had you do a character on this show like your character work is amazing. Oh, thanks, man

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:23.200
Well, I didn't you know, what's the space and shadow very Sanders? Oh, yeah

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:30.120
I mean you yeah, like yeah, it's like you immerse yourself into the silliest shit and then make this it's like it's the best

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:36.800
That's the best part about it. Yeah, just sort of finding connections to things and then connecting the gaps and just sort of disappearing and you know

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.000
Coming out the other end

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
It's like the fail-a-cootie thing is just

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:48.640
Because I was hanging out with Kyle and he said I want to open the next episode of Gumbel with this song and it

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.040
Was just fail-a talking and the music of his voice

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:58.960
I was like, that's pretty close to mine. I bet you I could do that and then he counts off the song and he just goes one two three five

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.920
And I was like, that's that's a five-second impression. That's perfect

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:04.400
If you just did that and walked away

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:11.040
so that whole premise of that thing is like what how little can I do but then also physically I'm gonna cut a

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.800
crazy widow's peak in my hair and

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:19.600
And for one day just have this weird fail-a-cootie haircut, you know

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.120
Just to set up a joke is kind of like that

01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:27.240
But we can't order it up like a fry cook we can't go to more than you should do a crazy character for Harmontown

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.960
You should come on next time. We won't we won't introduce you

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:36.040
You'll just or we'll introduce you as a man is just an alternate thing like you you'll just come up as some like

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:42.640
Character and do something and walk off. Yeah, just don't introduce me as to more to introduce me as the character hell

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.360
Yeah, are you gonna do it? So you're gonna go in the kitchen and cook something up and let us know when you want to do that

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:50.960
And then I'll just yeah, yeah, let's do that. Okay, great. Wow. This has been a productive

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:57.320
I mean I do that all the time this would do with characters like one-on-one even what I'll do is like if I if the character's ready in a way

01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:04.240
Then I'll just kind of in the week of the best thing is to go to food courts and malls as the character and just kind of hang out

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.200
And just do Monday and shit like order food and kind of be

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:13.000
Not so much to see how people react but see how it feels to be reacted to

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:19.520
By real people because then suddenly you've got this inner thing that's that's building and it's you think less about what's on the outside

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.520
More about the insides

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:23.240
All right

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:25.240
Dan do you have anything to plug?

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:28.080
Yeah, watch for my butt

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:34.720
Hell, yeah, I have to plug my butt. I have to plug my fat ass

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.400
I'm sorry. That's no

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:44.400
No, no, you had you have some of the you know why he's sorry is because he he he lost just

01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:50.080
Strategic ground it's not because he actually has remorse or empathy, right? He's making he was like, oh shit

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:56.720
I'm the bad guy now. I better backpedal. That's a good feeling. Yeah. Yes. It's like oh, I oh did oh

01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.520
Napoleon did you did you move into Russia?

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:08.280
It's fucking I sure did give me my iPad back. Yes. Give it back come over and get it come over and get it

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:13.200
Come to my house. I had people over yesterday. You didn't go up

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.040
I'm writing. It's hard to write

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:23.560
You're telling me you're you're telling me as soon as I'm finished. I will be a good person

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:31.560
I'm gonna end to this 45 years of being a piece of shit with retirement and I'm gonna know everyone's

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:36.680
Zodiac sign. I'm gonna like ask about your kids. It's good. I'm you everyone's gonna love me

01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:42.840
They're gonna be like you were this cool the whole time. Yeah, I was busy. That's it. So watch for that coming up soon. Yeah

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:49.720
Now that Rick and Morty's in limbo, it's like faster upon us. All right, well

01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.960
Anyone have a question for me?

01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:00.280
Spencer is there anything you'd like to plug? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. That's a good all man

01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:02.280
It's so interesting you ask. I guess I gotta think about that

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:07.800
You guys hear about these these Chinese murder vans

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:18.840
They're vans in China, isn't that just racist slang for ambulance? No, we we do do this every time

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:22.680
This is great. It's my favorite. This is becoming or like a real running gag

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:28.160
No, but they're these man these vans that they'll they'll pick you up and they'll kill you and put in theory

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:34.560
They're in some cases. They've they've linked to selling and transmitting your organs. So

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.080
Watch out for that. Yeah, also watch out for

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:41.160
If you have a student protest

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:47.560
In a giant square in the center of your town like they just turn off the cameras and roll all of you over with steamrollers and

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:53.600
There's that's another thing to keep your eye out for right tenements. That really happened. Yeah, they fucking

01:44:53.600 --> 01:45:01.920
Those people are spaghetti those people are spaghetti by the by by numbers that would shock by numbers

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:08.640
Yeah, Tiananmen Square happen and notice the yeah, it's like they were like, well, look at the guy for the tank

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:11.880
I can't tell if you're being serious and then they and then and then they just

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:18.160
They just fucking soylent greened people into fucking like yeah, they killed everybody

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:21.200
They killed everybody

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:28.360
Everyone this is what happens in autocracies. This is why we shouldn't like think it's cool to fucking like Russia

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:32.320
They kill gay people in journalists like they they like like China is a fucking

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:39.160
Yeah, like you can't like like can I just quickly on a soapbox look people people who are like, oh man

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:43.760
You shouldn't be worried about Russia. It's like look read about Russia. It's really bad

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:48.840
They definitely are putting gay people into camps. It's not about virtue signaling. It's about pragmatism

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:56.480
If you're into game theory you and you're fucking like you should be scared of the idea of not having checks and balances and three branches of government

01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:02.160
You fucking idiot. Yeah, sorry. You think I'm a noble person. I just don't want to die

01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:06.600
The part of it is like the way news is reported in this country

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:12.080
So for example when if I can't think of the guys in when the first the hitler not the first but when the spy

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.720
Was poisoned radioactively poisoned scurple

01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:22.820
It showed up on ABC News the day that it was sort of

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.560
Prominent as president was this is happening. He's dying. This is going on

01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:30.880
If you read the economists, which is not the greatest magazine in the world

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:36.280
but like it is certainly informative and has an opinion about a lot of stuff and it's weekly and

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.400
They he was saying for a year and a half before that they're gonna get me

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:46.100
They're gonna get me and people were listening, but nobody's only thing and when they went in a Chernobyl and like

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:53.360
Or when it went in and bought these grills and like gas at that basement and then said well, there were people in there

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.600
They were going to do bad things. So we had to take them all out

01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.000
There was a journalist who called bullshit on that and then she got shot in the head

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.540
Yeah, I'm gonna public courtyard. That's the thing

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:10.800
In a whole 20 shit like 20 things hit like that have happened like this is not we're not just making it up

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:16.240
Yeah, this shit has happened people are being killed. Yeah, we had a period in American history in the 1920s

01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:20.840
like it with the gangland culture was like being celebrated by

01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:29.240
Journalists and and you know as prohibition all that stuff the thing that really brought that whole thing down wasn't necessarily prohibitions repeal

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:31.760
And it wasn't Al Capone's taxes being

01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:39.800
Police is they killed a journalist like like like somebody wrote something about one of the gangsters that the gangsters didn't like and they just

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:46.600
They just treated him the way they treat mobsters and the fun stopped like we in our most brutal times

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.880
Like we have always in this country

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:58.040
Maybe only for white people after Scott. It's like we have these fucking like standards of free press isn't about like piousness

01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:03.280
It's not about like being holier than now. It's about like goddamn like we gotta you gotta be careful

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:08.280
We are animals. We will murder each other people will get away with what they get away with like you

01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:10.600
