{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:17.600\nOh my gosh, welcome to Meltdown Comics in the Nerdmelt Theater.\n\n00:17.600 --> 00:23.600\nIt is my pleasure to announce that Harmontown is once again in session.\n\n00:23.600 --> 00:31.600\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, my dear friend, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:31.600 --> 00:57.600\nI got a friend basket on my left, did some apple sauce on the right.\n\n00:57.600 --> 00:58.600\nClose enough.\n\n00:58.600 --> 00:59.600\nI came up a different way.\n\n00:59.600 --> 01:00.600\nYeah.\n\n01:00.600 --> 01:02.600\nFor those of you at home.\n\n01:02.600 --> 01:05.600\nI went to a party tonight.\n\n01:05.600 --> 01:08.600\nSo I'm a little drunk.\n\n01:08.600 --> 01:10.600\nStop it.\n\n01:10.600 --> 01:12.600\nDon't encourage it.\n\n01:12.600 --> 01:14.600\nYou're 20 and I'm 40.\n\n01:14.600 --> 01:18.600\nIt's not charismatic for me.\n\n01:18.600 --> 01:24.600\nWell, keep hitching your wagon to that star, my friend.\n\n01:24.600 --> 01:25.600\nI will be 60.\n\n01:25.600 --> 01:27.600\nI'll be under a bridge.\n\n01:27.600 --> 01:28.600\nYou'll be 40.\n\n01:28.600 --> 01:29.600\nYou'll have your own podcast.\n\n01:29.600 --> 01:31.600\nIt'll make you nothing.\n\n01:31.600 --> 01:35.600\nAnd we'll just keep this conveyor belt into a meat grinder.\n\n01:35.600 --> 01:38.600\nLike a pig-flavored-the-wall animation.\n\n01:38.600 --> 01:53.600\nI saw you, Dan, right before you left to this party and you were saying, Jeff, we were at a bar and Dan said, I'm not good with strangers.\n\n01:53.600 --> 02:03.600\nYou were worried about meeting your neighbor and he Google mapped where the party was and he found out that the house was the house right behind his backyard.\n\n02:03.600 --> 02:04.600\nSo how did it go?\n\n02:04.600 --> 02:06.600\nYeah, neighborly.\n\n02:06.600 --> 02:21.600\nBut there was a point at the party where I found out that this lady who was hosting the party, we were talking about wine and patios and cats.\n\n02:21.600 --> 02:27.600\nI'm going to guess she was white.\n\n02:27.600 --> 02:33.600\nThat's on you, my friend, but you are correct.\n\n02:33.600 --> 02:34.600\nJust a guess.\n\n02:34.600 --> 02:39.600\nShe let it drop and not in the way that you're used to it getting dropped.\n\n02:39.600 --> 02:47.600\nIt got dropped that she had survived a tremendous brain tumor.\n\n02:47.600 --> 02:54.600\nI'm too drunk to recall how organically it got scooted in.\n\n02:54.600 --> 02:58.600\nShe wasn't like, hey, that's my calling card.\n\n02:58.600 --> 03:00.600\nShe was cool with it.\n\n03:00.600 --> 03:01.600\nShe had survived it.\n\n03:01.600 --> 03:03.600\nIt was part of her life, absolutely.\n\n03:03.600 --> 03:10.600\nSo it accidentally arrived in the conversation and nothing could be more fascinating than you, to me, find that out.\n\n03:10.600 --> 03:11.600\nHoly shit, tell me more.\n\n03:11.600 --> 03:12.600\nHow does that start?\n\n03:12.600 --> 03:13.600\nWhat does it feel like?\n\n03:13.600 --> 03:14.600\nWhat's going on?\n\n03:14.600 --> 03:20.600\nSo I'm talking to a person who has had, she got under her iPhone.\n\n03:20.600 --> 03:32.600\nShe had iPhone photos of a golf ball sized meatball that was in her head, just center of it, like a cartoon.\n\n03:32.600 --> 03:37.600\nLike a profile of her skull and then from the top and then from the side.\n\n03:37.600 --> 03:41.600\nYou could see it right in the middle of her fucking brain, just a golf ball size.\n\n03:41.600 --> 03:43.600\nWhat are you writing down?\n\n03:43.600 --> 03:52.600\nToday's date.\n\n03:52.600 --> 03:57.600\nAm I boring you?\n\n03:57.600 --> 03:58.600\nThis woman.\n\n03:58.600 --> 04:02.600\nI had a couple drinks.\n\n04:02.600 --> 04:10.600\nI was in great proofs of comedy special at Mousseau and Frank's and there was gin to be had and I'm happy to say it.\n\n04:10.600 --> 04:12.600\nThere were tumor stories to be had at this party.\n\n04:12.600 --> 04:15.600\nI wrote down today's date.\n\n04:15.600 --> 04:18.600\nI wrote down 7, 13, 13 question mark.\n\n04:18.600 --> 04:19.600\nIs that right?\n\n04:19.600 --> 04:20.600\n14?\n\n04:20.600 --> 04:23.600\nOkay, fuck all you people.\n\n04:23.600 --> 04:27.600\nAnyways, 14 and I'm crossing out the question mark.\n\n04:27.600 --> 04:32.600\nThe only reason I wanted to tell the story is because of this curious social phenomenon.\n\n04:32.600 --> 04:34.600\nI'm standing on a patio.\n\n04:34.600 --> 04:45.600\nThe hostess has revealed I'm headlong into kind of deposing her about her experience because this is something that I'm unbelievable.\n\n04:45.600 --> 04:46.600\nThis happened to you.\n\n04:46.600 --> 04:47.600\nYou survived it.\n\n04:47.600 --> 04:48.600\nTell me more.\n\n04:48.600 --> 04:49.600\nHow did you find out?\n\n04:49.600 --> 04:52.600\nThere was another guy there, another neighbor.\n\n04:52.600 --> 04:55.600\nI hope he doesn't start listening to the podcast tonight.\n\n04:55.600 --> 04:57.600\nAnd this isn't on him.\n\n04:57.600 --> 04:58.600\nThis is on me.\n\n04:58.600 --> 05:08.600\nBut it was like halfway through me kind of like getting more information from her about this meatball that was in her head that she had survived.\n\n05:08.600 --> 05:11.600\nThis God struck lightning bolt.\n\n05:11.600 --> 05:13.600\nShe's walking around.\n\n05:13.600 --> 05:14.600\nShe's hanging out.\n\n05:14.600 --> 05:15.600\nShe's eating cheese with us.\n\n05:15.600 --> 05:20.600\nBut at one point, Zeus had tried as hard as he could.\n\n05:20.600 --> 05:29.600\nThe guy goes, he said, I think this is verbatim, he said, it's just like my wife.\n\n05:29.600 --> 05:33.600\nAnd I was like, okay, all right, swivel over to him.\n\n05:33.600 --> 05:34.600\nSlippery slope.\n\n05:34.600 --> 05:38.600\nThen he started talking about how his wife had been in a car accident.\n\n05:38.600 --> 05:47.600\nAnd he started describing the absolutely brutal details of this car accident that involved also her children were in the car.\n\n05:47.600 --> 05:52.600\nThere was no question that he had total, there was no, yes, it's great.\n\n05:52.600 --> 05:55.600\nAll I could think the entire time was go fuck yourself.\n\n05:55.600 --> 06:00.600\nFuck you, party guy with your wife accident.\n\n06:00.600 --> 06:02.600\nTalking to the tumor lady.\n\n06:02.600 --> 06:05.600\nThat's my only point.\n\n06:05.600 --> 06:10.600\nI just found myself, like this has nothing to do with good people, bad people, anything.\n\n06:10.600 --> 06:12.600\nIt's just like the weirdest human phenomenon.\n\n06:12.600 --> 06:18.600\nI've got a glass of chablis, I'm going to talk to this lady, survive this thing, it's growing.\n\n06:18.600 --> 06:20.600\nAnd then they MRI'd and then they radio activated.\n\n06:20.600 --> 06:24.600\nWell, my wife was there, the babies were bleeding and there was bacon on the highway.\n\n06:24.600 --> 06:27.600\nAnd all of a sudden, all of a sudden there's a good guy and a bad guy in the story.\n\n06:27.600 --> 06:29.600\nI'm just like, fuck this guy, fuck this guy.\n\n06:29.600 --> 06:31.600\nI can't wait to go to the bathroom and talk shit about him.\n\n06:31.600 --> 06:35.600\nWhat a piece of shit, fucking wife in a car accident, fucking cocksucker.\n\n06:35.600 --> 06:40.600\nI just think that's a funny human phenomenon.\n\n06:40.600 --> 06:45.600\nI'm sure he's not lying, but I knew he was a bad person.\n\n06:45.600 --> 06:50.600\nI went to a charity thing a couple of years ago and it was for children.\n\n06:50.600 --> 06:52.600\nFuck you, Jeff, I'm talking about the tumor lady.\n\n06:52.600 --> 06:55.600\nSee what he's trying to do?\n\n06:55.600 --> 07:01.600\nNo, I was at a thing for a charity for children that had been burned.\n\n07:01.600 --> 07:06.600\nAnd I was sitting at a table, there were firemen there and they have a lot invested in that\n\n07:06.600 --> 07:11.600\nthey are involved in the accidents that happen when people get burned.\n\n07:11.600 --> 07:13.600\nAnd so it's a very emotional thing.\n\n07:13.600 --> 07:17.600\nAnd there was a woman there I talked to and she goes, fuck this, I fucking hate this fucking charity.\n\n07:17.600 --> 07:18.600\nShe was so bummed out about it.\n\n07:18.600 --> 07:19.600\nFucking burnt people.\n\n07:19.600 --> 07:22.600\nBecause she told me, I was like, why?\n\n07:22.600 --> 07:25.600\nWhat's your stakes in this?\n\n07:25.600 --> 07:30.600\nAnd she's like, I have a child that was born with an illness from birth.\n\n07:30.600 --> 07:32.600\nShe never had a chance.\n\n07:32.600 --> 07:36.600\nEvery child had a chance to not get burned.\n\n07:36.600 --> 07:38.600\nAnd I was like, interesting.\n\n07:38.600 --> 07:45.600\nI thought she was going to say, she was saying, this is a bullshit charity.\n\n07:45.600 --> 07:51.600\nI was like, I can't root for anything anymore forever.\n\n07:51.600 --> 07:53.600\nSee, that's very interesting though.\n\n07:53.600 --> 07:57.600\nIt's like, where do you, do you ever walk down the sidewalk, you go into the grocery\n\n07:57.600 --> 08:04.600\nstore, it's three in the morning, you're, all right, midnight, whatever you fucking,\n\n08:04.600 --> 08:08.600\nyou're going to get pencil supplies, whatever.\n\n08:08.600 --> 08:11.600\nMe, I'm going to get a bottle opener.\n\n08:11.600 --> 08:16.600\nYou hear a little meow, meow, meow, and you look and there's a little, there's a little\n\n08:16.600 --> 08:21.600\nraggedy little dirt covered MacGuffin, like a little, inside the drugstore.\n\n08:21.600 --> 08:27.600\nNo, just another, like one of a million stray cats, like just like, meow, meow, meow, meow.\n\n08:27.600 --> 08:31.600\nLike, you know it's going to die if you don't, or maybe it won't, or it'll end up in a shelter.\n\n08:31.600 --> 08:37.600\nLike, the only, you, then you pull back in your head and you imagine a map of Los Angeles\n\n08:37.600 --> 08:42.600\nand you go, okay, what if every stray cat in Los Angeles was a little red dot?\n\n08:42.600 --> 08:47.600\nThe map of Los Angeles, as far as you could pull back, would be a giant red dot.\n\n08:47.600 --> 08:51.600\nThere is just a, it's just a condition.\n\n08:51.600 --> 08:53.600\nIt's misery, feline misery.\n\n08:53.600 --> 08:58.600\nSo you think that about the human condition too, and it's like, it's, it is so weird.\n\n08:58.600 --> 09:01.600\nYou go to a camp for kids who have been burnt.\n\n09:01.600 --> 09:04.600\nHow can you not be on the side of that?\n\n09:04.600 --> 09:07.600\nWhen your life has been affected by something other than that.\n\n09:07.600 --> 09:08.600\nOther than that.\n\n09:08.600 --> 09:11.600\nAnd it's not, it's like, the neuronal heroes are villains, it's crazy.\n\n09:11.600 --> 09:14.600\nThey look like, like, like, like, what fucking charity do you give to?\n\n09:14.600 --> 09:18.600\nIf you, if you find a billion dollars under a rock tomorrow, you know,\n\n09:18.600 --> 09:22.600\nlike, like, like, like, ugh, there's just like, like, uncharismatic sort of fire\n\n09:22.600 --> 09:25.600\nthat keeps raging where you squirt your little fire hose at it.\n\n09:25.600 --> 09:27.600\nThat's called poverty.\n\n09:27.600 --> 09:28.600\nHunger.\n\n09:28.600 --> 09:33.600\nIt's the thought that counts me.\n\n09:33.600 --> 09:38.600\nAnd then there's the charismatic tragedies with the human phases on them.\n\n09:38.600 --> 09:39.600\nI don't know.\n\n09:39.600 --> 09:41.600\nWhat is the most charismatic tragedy?\n\n09:41.600 --> 09:47.600\nI mean, let's, let's bring tragedies in terms of charisma.\n\n09:47.600 --> 09:50.600\nWell, it's, it's, it's antigeria.\n\n09:50.600 --> 09:52.600\nIt's the opposite of progeria.\n\n09:52.600 --> 09:53.600\nIt's old people.\n\n09:53.600 --> 09:59.600\nThey slowly become so adorable that they die.\n\n09:59.600 --> 10:00.600\nIt's what's more important.\n\n10:00.600 --> 10:02.600\nThey get sucked up back inside a uterus.\n\n10:02.600 --> 10:03.600\nYeah.\n\n10:03.600 --> 10:04.600\nAnd it's like, fuck you guys.\n\n10:04.600 --> 10:08.600\nBut it's very tragic, but you can't tell from looking at it.\n\n10:08.600 --> 10:14.600\nI want to bring a friend to the stage because he, he's got a heart in and a heart out.\n\n10:14.600 --> 10:18.600\nAnd he's, he's, he's got a heart in and a heart out.\n\n10:18.600 --> 10:19.600\nYeah.\n\n10:19.600 --> 10:27.600\nHe's dropping in by parachute and then he's rolling out like on a bayonet.\n\n10:27.600 --> 10:31.600\nI don't, I don't do, I don't do good interviews and I don't do good introductions.\n\n10:31.600 --> 10:32.600\nLet's just bring him up.\n\n10:32.600 --> 10:48.600\nManiac is here.\n\n10:48.600 --> 10:49.600\nSorry.\n\n10:49.600 --> 10:51.600\nWelcome to my poorly formatted show.\n\n10:51.600 --> 10:52.600\nI'm sorry.\n\n10:52.600 --> 10:53.600\nThank you so much.\n\n10:53.600 --> 10:54.600\nI listened to yours today.\n\n10:54.600 --> 10:57.600\nI listened to episode 11 of your podcast, getting it on with James.\n\n10:57.600 --> 10:58.600\nAre you getting on?\n\n10:58.600 --> 10:59.600\nGetting on.\n\n10:59.600 --> 11:00.600\nNot getting it on.\n\n11:00.600 --> 11:01.600\nGetting it on.\n\n11:01.600 --> 11:02.600\nIt's very different.\n\n11:02.600 --> 11:03.600\nIt's called heart in and heart out.\n\n11:03.600 --> 11:05.600\nSo James abandoned it.\n\n11:05.600 --> 11:08.600\nYour most recent episode is lockdown.\n\n11:08.600 --> 11:10.600\nAnd it's, it's true.\n\n11:10.600 --> 11:11.600\nIt's, it's great.\n\n11:11.600 --> 11:16.600\nLike, like, like there's lots of podcasts out there that look super ego comes to mind.\n\n11:16.600 --> 11:17.600\nIt's just an experience.\n\n11:17.600 --> 11:21.600\nLike there are people like me who are just dumping their dumb narcissistic asses into\n\n11:21.600 --> 11:23.600\na microphone and like pumping it out there.\n\n11:23.600 --> 11:24.600\nAnd that's great too.\n\n11:24.600 --> 11:25.600\nThat's, that's worthy of something.\n\n11:25.600 --> 11:28.600\nThere's a technique to your neurotic spluttering.\n\n11:28.600 --> 11:33.600\nSomehow Bert children are being helped right now by me doing this.\n\n11:33.600 --> 11:39.600\nBut then there is the actual use of the medium, which is so charismatic and so envy inducing\n\n11:39.600 --> 11:44.260\nwhen I listen to, I listen to that thing and it's fucking fast and tight and amazing and\n\n11:44.260 --> 11:47.600\npurely driven by your resonant tones.\n\n11:47.600 --> 11:50.600\nYou're, you're, you're Dr. Venture from Venture Brothers.\n\n11:50.600 --> 11:54.240\nYou, you, you, you are a professional voice actor.\n\n11:54.240 --> 11:57.600\nYou know what's for sale when you talk into a microphone and I'm just.\n\n11:57.600 --> 11:58.600\nThank you, Dan.\n\n11:58.600 --> 11:59.600\nYeah.\n\n11:59.600 --> 12:03.100\nAnd this, and this thing, there's 11 episodes of it.\n\n12:03.100 --> 12:04.600\nPlease click on them and listen.\n\n12:04.600 --> 12:05.600\nIt's a fictional podcast.\n\n12:05.600 --> 12:06.600\nYeah.\n\n12:06.600 --> 12:07.600\nTell a little stories in every episode.\n\n12:07.600 --> 12:08.600\nYeah.\n\n12:08.600 --> 12:12.200\nIt's just like little short plays, but the idea is that it's James Rabani acts podcast,\n\n12:12.200 --> 12:16.600\nbut each month James Rabani act could be a different character and they give it in circumstances\n\n12:16.600 --> 12:17.600\nof his life are completely different.\n\n12:17.600 --> 12:22.800\nAnd so there, it's basically me like talking about stuff, but like sometimes I'm sort of\n\n12:22.800 --> 12:26.600\nmyself, but like in the one you just listened to, I'm the captain of a spaceship.\n\n12:26.600 --> 12:27.600\nYeah.\n\n12:27.600 --> 12:30.600\nAnd then like this one where I'm a drunken college professor who just got fired.\n\n12:30.600 --> 12:34.600\nThere's another one where I'm a guy who just experienced a personal tragedy.\n\n12:34.600 --> 12:36.600\nJust tying it together with the theme of this show.\n\n12:36.600 --> 12:37.600\nYeah.\n\n12:37.600 --> 12:41.600\nAnd that one gets like really dark and so like, but it started out just because I wanted to\n\n12:41.600 --> 12:45.600\njust make something in my house.\n\n12:45.600 --> 12:46.600\nThat was easy.\n\n12:46.600 --> 12:48.600\nI mean, relatively easy to make and just put it out there.\n\n12:48.600 --> 12:50.600\nAnd then I asked a bunch of writer friends to write for it.\n\n12:50.600 --> 12:54.600\nAnd then I've been writing with the right, my writing partner, Brie Williams.\n\n12:54.600 --> 12:57.600\nAnd we've written like three of them so far, including the space one.\n\n12:57.600 --> 12:58.600\nThat's pretty great.\n\n12:58.600 --> 13:00.600\nEasy to, easy to subscribe to.\n\n13:00.600 --> 13:01.600\nAnd yeah.\n\n13:01.600 --> 13:06.600\nAnd it's on the Farrell audio.com with the Harmontown.\n\n13:06.600 --> 13:09.600\nIt's part of the Farrell family of stars.\n\n13:09.600 --> 13:12.600\nYou know, there's a lot of very interesting things in the Farrell audio network.\n\n13:12.600 --> 13:15.600\nWe're doing a new thing where we take a little break and do a Farrell audio.\n\n13:15.600 --> 13:17.600\nOh, I didn't get that the point of that transition.\n\n13:17.600 --> 13:18.600\nIt's an experimental thing.\n\n13:18.600 --> 13:19.600\nIt was my idea.\n\n13:19.600 --> 13:21.600\nI thought you were sending up that kind of plug.\n\n13:21.600 --> 13:22.600\nNo, no.\n\n13:22.600 --> 13:25.600\nDo you want a musical theme for that?\n\n13:25.600 --> 13:29.600\nNo, no, I think it's better to just have silence and then you go with that.\n\n13:29.600 --> 13:30.600\nOkay.\n\n13:30.600 --> 13:31.600\nFarrell audio.\n\n13:31.600 --> 13:33.600\nLet's talk about these kids for a second.\n\n13:33.600 --> 13:34.600\nI mean.\n\n13:34.600 --> 13:36.600\nFarrell audio.\n\n13:36.600 --> 13:38.600\nFarrell audio.\n\n13:38.600 --> 13:40.600\nI mean, sure, if you're a burnt kid.\n\n13:40.600 --> 13:41.600\nFarrell audio.\n\n13:41.600 --> 13:45.600\nMy favorite audio.\n\n13:45.600 --> 13:49.600\nAnd there are groups of people out there who have it worst.\n\n13:49.600 --> 13:56.600\nYou know, burnt kids and people with tumors and things, but Farrell audio makes no money.\n\n13:56.600 --> 14:01.600\nThey're just a collective of brilliant people doing podcasting just for the fuck of it.\n\n14:01.600 --> 14:02.600\nThat's right.\n\n14:02.600 --> 14:03.600\nThey're good people.\n\n14:03.600 --> 14:06.600\nBecause young Dustin is about the work.\n\n14:06.600 --> 14:07.600\nYeah.\n\n14:07.600 --> 14:08.600\nHe just hangs out.\n\n14:08.600 --> 14:10.600\nDustin Marshall everybody.\n\n14:10.600 --> 14:13.600\nThe founder of Farrell audio.\n\n14:13.600 --> 14:14.600\nOnly 12 years old.\n\n14:14.600 --> 14:15.600\nHe's only 12 years old.\n\n14:15.600 --> 14:17.600\nPeople don't know that about Dustin Marshall.\n\n14:17.600 --> 14:19.600\nGreat Mark Cap and headphones.\n\n14:19.600 --> 14:20.600\nHe's never without him.\n\n14:20.600 --> 14:21.600\nHe's like a cartoon character.\n\n14:21.600 --> 14:22.600\nWhen you take the headphones off.\n\n14:22.600 --> 14:24.600\nHe was orphaned in 1892.\n\n14:24.600 --> 14:27.600\nSee him walking up and down Franklin Avenue in his Cap and headphones.\n\n14:27.600 --> 14:28.600\nListening to podcasts.\n\n14:28.600 --> 14:31.600\nHis life truly, his headstone will say.\n\n14:31.600 --> 14:35.600\nDustin Marshall, Dustin Marshall.\n\n14:35.600 --> 14:38.600\nHe's a little newsy.\n\n14:38.600 --> 14:41.600\nHeadphones and a hat.\n\n14:41.600 --> 14:43.600\nD.\n\n14:43.600 --> 14:46.600\nI was going to do a rap bridge for that.\n\n14:46.600 --> 14:47.600\nI do a rap bridge.\n\n14:47.600 --> 14:48.600\nD.\n\n14:48.600 --> 14:49.600\nTo the U.\n\n14:49.600 --> 14:50.600\nTo the S.\n\n14:50.600 --> 14:51.600\nTo the T.\n\n14:51.600 --> 14:52.600\nTo the I.\n\n14:52.600 --> 14:53.600\nTo the I.\n\n14:53.600 --> 14:54.600\nThat's it.\n\n14:54.600 --> 14:55.600\nThat was your spelling.\n\n14:55.600 --> 15:00.600\nThat's a very popular rap trope.\n\n15:00.600 --> 15:01.600\nSpelling.\n\n15:01.600 --> 15:04.600\nBut the two though, yeah.\n\n15:04.600 --> 15:05.600\nYeah.\n\n15:05.600 --> 15:10.600\nDustin Marshall's headstone will definitely have the words extra, extra on them.\n\n15:10.600 --> 15:15.600\nThey'll have little stone headphones over the headstone.\n\n15:15.600 --> 15:16.600\nRead all about it.\n\n15:16.600 --> 15:17.600\nThere'll be real headphones.\n\n15:17.600 --> 15:21.600\nYou can hear his plaintive wails from beyond the grave.\n\n15:21.600 --> 15:23.600\nYeah, you can put them up.\n\n15:23.600 --> 15:27.600\nI'm alive!\n\n15:27.600 --> 15:30.600\nKevin, you rose buds while he made.\n\n15:30.600 --> 15:35.600\nI'm down here trying to court Marc Maron.\n\n15:35.600 --> 15:41.600\nMarc Maron, did he go over to Marc Maron's grave and he's like, I don't need you.\n\n15:41.600 --> 15:46.600\nIt's a gold brush right now, the podcast industry.\n\n15:46.600 --> 15:52.600\nErbaniak, you played Crumb in The Moving Arts Splendor.\n\n15:52.600 --> 15:54.600\nYeah, I did.\n\n15:54.600 --> 15:56.600\nYeah, that was exciting.\n\n15:56.600 --> 15:58.600\nWas there any direction?\n\n15:58.600 --> 16:00.600\nDid you research?\n\n16:00.600 --> 16:05.600\nWell, when that audition came in, you know, you audition for these things as an actor\n\n16:05.600 --> 16:08.600\nand usually you go, well, I'll do the best I can.\n\n16:08.600 --> 16:14.600\nBut that audition came in, it was 2001, that audition came in on the answering machine.\n\n16:14.600 --> 16:16.600\nWe had answering machines back then.\n\n16:16.600 --> 16:21.600\nSo this is the exposition from your mom when you come in, like your cat woman.\n\n16:21.600 --> 16:24.600\nOh, James, what are you going to make of that girl?\n\n16:24.600 --> 16:26.600\nYeah, exactly, the answering machine trope.\n\n16:26.600 --> 16:31.600\nAnd then they said, you audition with The Moving Arts Splendor to play Robert Crumb\n\n16:31.600 --> 16:33.600\nand I thought, that part is mine.\n\n16:33.600 --> 16:35.600\nNo one else is more qualified.\n\n16:35.600 --> 16:40.600\nI'm thin, I'm tall, I'm an amateur cartoonist.\n\n16:40.600 --> 16:41.600\nI saw Crumb.\n\n16:41.600 --> 16:43.600\nI saw Crumb and I'm a fan of his work.\n\n16:43.600 --> 16:45.600\nI have a hat like that.\n\n16:45.600 --> 16:48.600\nWas Crumb out, Crumb had been out, did you?\n\n16:48.600 --> 16:52.600\nOh my God, I saw Crumb and it came out, that's a masterpiece, that movie.\n\n16:52.600 --> 16:53.600\nOh, that's amazing.\n\n16:53.600 --> 16:55.600\nAnd then I watched that like a loop, then I auditioned.\n\n16:55.600 --> 17:02.600\nNo, and the auditions for American Splendor were September 10th, 2001, 9-10.\n\n17:02.600 --> 17:04.600\nThen what happened?\n\n17:04.600 --> 17:08.600\nThen the callback was like six weeks later.\n\n17:08.600 --> 17:12.600\nI had to wait forever.\n\n17:12.600 --> 17:16.600\nIt's true, the auditions were in downtown New York.\n\n17:16.600 --> 17:20.600\nThe auditions were in downtown New York at Canal Street at Good Machine\n\n17:20.600 --> 17:23.600\nand it was illegal to go downtown for like four weeks.\n\n17:23.600 --> 17:26.600\nYeah, it was fucking terrorists.\n\n17:26.600 --> 17:29.600\nThey almost fucked up by getting that book.\n\n17:29.600 --> 17:31.600\nWas 9-11 an inside job?\n\n17:31.600 --> 17:37.600\nI gave you a real good segue there and it's true.\n\n17:37.600 --> 17:41.600\nI just watched two documentaries today and I've become, I've gone from...\n\n17:41.600 --> 17:44.600\nI walked into the drawing room earlier today and Dan was sitting next to Dino\n\n17:44.600 --> 17:49.600\nand Dan was clearly in the middle of a rant about the melting point of steel.\n\n17:49.600 --> 17:50.600\nYes.\n\n17:50.600 --> 17:52.600\nI've become one of these people.\n\n17:52.600 --> 17:55.600\nIs that conspiracy guy, what's his face?\n\n17:55.600 --> 17:57.600\nBarky McGee, you know, the one who's always...\n\n17:57.600 --> 17:58.600\nMcGrath?\n\n17:58.600 --> 18:00.600\nWho's the famous conspiracy guy?\n\n18:00.600 --> 18:01.600\nWho's the crime dog?\n\n18:01.600 --> 18:04.600\nAlex Jones, thank you. Barky McGee, I call him.\n\n18:04.600 --> 18:08.600\nWas he in these documentaries, Alex Jones?\n\n18:08.600 --> 18:10.600\nAlex, no, I don't...\n\n18:10.600 --> 18:12.600\nAlright, because he just makes the living like making shit up.\n\n18:12.600 --> 18:19.600\nBut back in the day, anybody who was talking about the boiling point of metal\n\n18:19.600 --> 18:25.600\nand the pancake and all this shit, I was so turned off by that stuff\n\n18:25.600 --> 18:29.600\nbecause it was precisely because it was like, you know what, no, there's not a fucking...\n\n18:29.600 --> 18:31.600\nI don't want to romanticize this.\n\n18:31.600 --> 18:33.600\nThis is an actual Jesus Christ.\n\n18:33.600 --> 18:35.600\nThese people died and it's a fucking big deal\n\n18:35.600 --> 18:39.600\nand more importantly, it's about the government's kind of ineptitude.\n\n18:39.600 --> 18:41.600\nI wanted to...\n\n18:41.600 --> 18:45.600\nI remember being in therapy sessions and saying to therapists, like,\n\n18:45.600 --> 18:47.600\nyeah, I'm just angry about this.\n\n18:47.600 --> 18:49.600\nThese people, they didn't do anything.\n\n18:49.600 --> 18:51.600\nWe pay our taxes.\n\n18:51.600 --> 18:54.600\nYou're supposed to be in this no fly zone.\n\n18:54.600 --> 18:57.600\nI thought you were supposed to clip your Dilbert cartoons\n\n18:57.600 --> 19:00.600\nand have your coupons for cat food.\n\n19:00.600 --> 19:05.600\nI thought the whole exchange was supposed to ultimately have to do with security.\n\n19:05.600 --> 19:08.600\nBut no, you can just go...\n\n19:08.600 --> 19:10.600\nI was mad about it back then. I was mad.\n\n19:10.600 --> 19:13.600\nAnd I never wanted to hear anybody saying, like,\n\n19:13.600 --> 19:15.600\nwell, you know, they never...\n\n19:15.600 --> 19:19.600\nlike 77 is the kind of metal that on the plane of the tail couldn't have...\n\n19:19.600 --> 19:21.600\nI was like, those people are quacks.\n\n19:21.600 --> 19:25.600\nI don't want to talk to those people because they're trying to JFK-ify\n\n19:25.600 --> 19:29.600\nsomething that is actually deeply patriotic,\n\n19:29.600 --> 19:33.600\nspiritual, like, important, personal.\n\n19:33.600 --> 19:35.600\nBut now I start just today.\n\n19:35.600 --> 19:38.600\nI guess, like, maybe I hit some tipping point or...\n\n19:38.600 --> 19:39.600\nI don't know, maybe...\n\n19:39.600 --> 19:40.600\nWhat did you watch?\n\n19:40.600 --> 19:43.600\nI watched these just weird documentaries, whatever was available.\n\n19:43.600 --> 19:45.600\nI don't know what happened to me today.\n\n19:45.600 --> 19:47.600\nI just drifted into some weird cloud.\n\n19:47.600 --> 19:49.600\nMaybe it's because of the community.\n\n19:49.600 --> 19:53.600\nLike, I was just looking for an escape.\n\n19:53.600 --> 19:55.600\nI was looking for the pressures.\n\n19:55.600 --> 19:57.600\nYou know, I just wanted a Sunday to just, like, escape into a cloud.\n\n19:57.600 --> 19:59.600\nYou should get fired again.\n\n19:59.600 --> 20:03.600\nThat would help. That would help.\n\n20:03.600 --> 20:08.600\nI watched this documentary called Press for Truth,\n\n20:08.600 --> 20:10.600\nI think it was called, or Press...\n\n20:10.600 --> 20:12.600\nAnd then another one that was called Zero.\n\n20:12.600 --> 20:15.600\nThe latter is the more, like, sci-fi,\n\n20:15.600 --> 20:18.600\nkind of like, what's the melting point of steel kind of stuff.\n\n20:18.600 --> 20:20.600\nPress for Truth is actually kind of impressive\n\n20:20.600 --> 20:22.600\nbecause it's very deeply personal.\n\n20:22.600 --> 20:27.600\nIt's about the, like, the wives of victims, like, going,\n\n20:27.600 --> 20:29.600\njust, like, on a human level.\n\n20:29.600 --> 20:31.600\nThey're just going, they're not saying,\n\n20:31.600 --> 20:35.600\nI think that spaghetti was the motivation.\n\n20:35.600 --> 20:37.600\nLike, they're just saying,\n\n20:37.600 --> 20:39.600\nno one's giving us a satisfactory answer.\n\n20:39.600 --> 20:41.600\nAnyways, guys, what do you think?\n\n20:41.600 --> 20:43.600\nI don't know.\n\n20:43.600 --> 20:45.600\nWhat's their theory?\n\n20:45.600 --> 20:46.600\nWell, there's a...\n\n20:46.600 --> 20:49.600\nIn the first one, there was, like, this huge thing about Pakistan.\n\n20:49.600 --> 20:52.600\nI'm sorry, the kumail's not here to...\n\n20:52.600 --> 20:54.600\nTo be bummed out.\n\n20:54.600 --> 20:56.600\nThere's, like, all this...\n\n20:56.600 --> 20:58.600\nI can't keep track of it. Your head starts to spin.\n\n20:58.600 --> 21:00.600\nThat's the thing that conspiracy theorists have as an advantage.\n\n21:00.600 --> 21:02.600\nIs this the thing where they're saying,\n\n21:02.600 --> 21:05.600\noh, well, it was the American government did it themselves?\n\n21:05.600 --> 21:08.600\nWell, certainly the second of the two,\n\n21:08.600 --> 21:11.600\nthe one that's called Zero, yeah, it's all about...\n\n21:11.600 --> 21:14.600\nYeah, absolutely the implication is that it's an inside job.\n\n21:14.600 --> 21:16.600\nDan, if you had to guess right now,\n\n21:16.600 --> 21:18.600\nwith what limited information and intelligence that you have,\n\n21:18.600 --> 21:20.600\nas is my job.\n\n21:20.600 --> 21:22.600\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n21:22.600 --> 21:24.600\nI'm not saying you have to be right,\n\n21:24.600 --> 21:26.600\nbut if you had to go from your gut with what facts,\n\n21:26.600 --> 21:28.600\ninformation you currently have,\n\n21:28.600 --> 21:30.600\nwhat do you think happened?\n\n21:30.600 --> 21:34.600\nHonestly, I swear to God, I'm not kidding.\n\n21:34.600 --> 21:36.600\nLike, I don't... I have no idea.\n\n21:36.600 --> 21:38.600\nI don't know. I swear to God.\n\n21:38.600 --> 21:40.600\nDo you think a plane hit the Pentagon?\n\n21:40.600 --> 21:42.600\nGod damn it.\n\n21:42.600 --> 21:45.600\nNow I've watched these two things today.\n\n21:45.600 --> 21:48.600\nI would have...
