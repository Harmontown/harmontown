00:00.000 --> 00:17.600
Oh my gosh, welcome to Meltdown Comics in the Nerdmelt Theater.

00:17.600 --> 00:23.600
It is my pleasure to announce that Harmontown is once again in session.

00:23.600 --> 00:31.600
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, my dear friend, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:31.600 --> 00:57.600
I got a friend basket on my left, did some apple sauce on the right.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.600
Close enough.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.600
I came up a different way.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.600
Yeah.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.600
For those of you at home.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.600
I went to a party tonight.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.600
So I'm a little drunk.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.600
Stop it.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.600
Don't encourage it.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.600
You're 20 and I'm 40.

01:14.600 --> 01:18.600
It's not charismatic for me.

01:18.600 --> 01:24.600
Well, keep hitching your wagon to that star, my friend.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.600
I will be 60.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.600
I'll be under a bridge.

01:27.600 --> 01:28.600
You'll be 40.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.600
You'll have your own podcast.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.600
It'll make you nothing.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.600
And we'll just keep this conveyor belt into a meat grinder.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.600
Like a pig-flavored-the-wall animation.

01:38.600 --> 01:53.600
I saw you, Dan, right before you left to this party and you were saying, Jeff, we were at a bar and Dan said, I'm not good with strangers.

01:53.600 --> 02:03.600
You were worried about meeting your neighbor and he Google mapped where the party was and he found out that the house was the house right behind his backyard.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.600
So how did it go?

02:04.600 --> 02:06.600
Yeah, neighborly.

02:06.600 --> 02:21.600
But there was a point at the party where I found out that this lady who was hosting the party, we were talking about wine and patios and cats.

02:21.600 --> 02:27.600
I'm going to guess she was white.

02:27.600 --> 02:33.600
That's on you, my friend, but you are correct.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.600
Just a guess.

02:34.600 --> 02:39.600
She let it drop and not in the way that you're used to it getting dropped.

02:39.600 --> 02:47.600
It got dropped that she had survived a tremendous brain tumor.

02:47.600 --> 02:54.600
I'm too drunk to recall how organically it got scooted in.

02:54.600 --> 02:58.600
She wasn't like, hey, that's my calling card.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.600
She was cool with it.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.600
She had survived it.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.600
It was part of her life, absolutely.

03:03.600 --> 03:10.600
So it accidentally arrived in the conversation and nothing could be more fascinating than you, to me, find that out.

03:10.600 --> 03:11.600
Holy shit, tell me more.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.600
How does that start?

03:12.600 --> 03:13.600
What does it feel like?

03:13.600 --> 03:14.600
What's going on?

03:14.600 --> 03:20.600
So I'm talking to a person who has had, she got under her iPhone.

03:20.600 --> 03:32.600
She had iPhone photos of a golf ball sized meatball that was in her head, just center of it, like a cartoon.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.600
Like a profile of her skull and then from the top and then from the side.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.600
You could see it right in the middle of her fucking brain, just a golf ball size.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.600
What are you writing down?

03:43.600 --> 03:52.600
Today's date.

03:52.600 --> 03:57.600
Am I boring you?

03:57.600 --> 03:58.600
This woman.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.600
I had a couple drinks.

04:02.600 --> 04:10.600
I was in great proofs of comedy special at Mousseau and Frank's and there was gin to be had and I'm happy to say it.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.600
There were tumor stories to be had at this party.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.600
I wrote down today's date.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.600
I wrote down 7, 13, 13 question mark.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.600
Is that right?

04:19.600 --> 04:20.600
14?

04:20.600 --> 04:23.600
Okay, fuck all you people.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.600
Anyways, 14 and I'm crossing out the question mark.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.600
The only reason I wanted to tell the story is because of this curious social phenomenon.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.600
I'm standing on a patio.

04:34.600 --> 04:45.600
The hostess has revealed I'm headlong into kind of deposing her about her experience because this is something that I'm unbelievable.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.600
This happened to you.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.600
You survived it.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.600
Tell me more.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.600
How did you find out?

04:49.600 --> 04:52.600
There was another guy there, another neighbor.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.600
I hope he doesn't start listening to the podcast tonight.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.600
And this isn't on him.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.600
This is on me.

04:58.600 --> 05:08.600
But it was like halfway through me kind of like getting more information from her about this meatball that was in her head that she had survived.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.600
This God struck lightning bolt.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.600
She's walking around.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.600
She's hanging out.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.600
She's eating cheese with us.

05:15.600 --> 05:20.600
But at one point, Zeus had tried as hard as he could.

05:20.600 --> 05:29.600
The guy goes, he said, I think this is verbatim, he said, it's just like my wife.

05:29.600 --> 05:33.600
And I was like, okay, all right, swivel over to him.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.600
Slippery slope.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.600
Then he started talking about how his wife had been in a car accident.

05:38.600 --> 05:47.600
And he started describing the absolutely brutal details of this car accident that involved also her children were in the car.

05:47.600 --> 05:52.600
There was no question that he had total, there was no, yes, it's great.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.600
All I could think the entire time was go fuck yourself.

05:55.600 --> 06:00.600
Fuck you, party guy with your wife accident.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.600
Talking to the tumor lady.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.600
That's my only point.

06:05.600 --> 06:10.600
I just found myself, like this has nothing to do with good people, bad people, anything.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.600
It's just like the weirdest human phenomenon.

06:12.600 --> 06:18.600
I've got a glass of chablis, I'm going to talk to this lady, survive this thing, it's growing.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.600
And then they MRI'd and then they radio activated.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.600
Well, my wife was there, the babies were bleeding and there was bacon on the highway.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.600
And all of a sudden, all of a sudden there's a good guy and a bad guy in the story.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.600
I'm just like, fuck this guy, fuck this guy.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.600
I can't wait to go to the bathroom and talk shit about him.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.600
What a piece of shit, fucking wife in a car accident, fucking cocksucker.

06:35.600 --> 06:40.600
I just think that's a funny human phenomenon.

06:40.600 --> 06:45.600
I'm sure he's not lying, but I knew he was a bad person.

06:45.600 --> 06:50.600
I went to a charity thing a couple of years ago and it was for children.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.600
Fuck you, Jeff, I'm talking about the tumor lady.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.600
See what he's trying to do?

06:55.600 --> 07:01.600
No, I was at a thing for a charity for children that had been burned.

07:01.600 --> 07:06.600
And I was sitting at a table, there were firemen there and they have a lot invested in that

07:06.600 --> 07:11.600
they are involved in the accidents that happen when people get burned.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.600
And so it's a very emotional thing.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.600
And there was a woman there I talked to and she goes, fuck this, I fucking hate this fucking charity.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.600
She was so bummed out about it.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.600
Fucking burnt people.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.600
Because she told me, I was like, why?

07:22.600 --> 07:25.600
What's your stakes in this?

07:25.600 --> 07:30.600
And she's like, I have a child that was born with an illness from birth.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.600
She never had a chance.

07:32.600 --> 07:36.600
Every child had a chance to not get burned.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.600
And I was like, interesting.

07:38.600 --> 07:45.600
I thought she was going to say, she was saying, this is a bullshit charity.

07:45.600 --> 07:51.600
I was like, I can't root for anything anymore forever.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.600
See, that's very interesting though.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.600
It's like, where do you, do you ever walk down the sidewalk, you go into the grocery

07:57.600 --> 08:04.600
store, it's three in the morning, you're, all right, midnight, whatever you fucking,

08:04.600 --> 08:08.600
you're going to get pencil supplies, whatever.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.600
Me, I'm going to get a bottle opener.

08:11.600 --> 08:16.600
You hear a little meow, meow, meow, and you look and there's a little, there's a little

08:16.600 --> 08:21.600
raggedy little dirt covered MacGuffin, like a little, inside the drugstore.

08:21.600 --> 08:27.600
No, just another, like one of a million stray cats, like just like, meow, meow, meow, meow.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.600
Like, you know it's going to die if you don't, or maybe it won't, or it'll end up in a shelter.

08:31.600 --> 08:37.600
Like, the only, you, then you pull back in your head and you imagine a map of Los Angeles

08:37.600 --> 08:42.600
and you go, okay, what if every stray cat in Los Angeles was a little red dot?

08:42.600 --> 08:47.600
The map of Los Angeles, as far as you could pull back, would be a giant red dot.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.600
There is just a, it's just a condition.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.600
It's misery, feline misery.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.600
So you think that about the human condition too, and it's like, it's, it is so weird.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.600
You go to a camp for kids who have been burnt.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.600
How can you not be on the side of that?

09:04.600 --> 09:07.600
When your life has been affected by something other than that.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.600
Other than that.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.600
And it's not, it's like, the neuronal heroes are villains, it's crazy.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.600
They look like, like, like, like, what fucking charity do you give to?

09:14.600 --> 09:18.600
If you, if you find a billion dollars under a rock tomorrow, you know,

09:18.600 --> 09:22.600
like, like, like, like, ugh, there's just like, like, uncharismatic sort of fire

09:22.600 --> 09:25.600
that keeps raging where you squirt your little fire hose at it.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.600
That's called poverty.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.600
Hunger.

09:28.600 --> 09:33.600
It's the thought that counts me.

09:33.600 --> 09:38.600
And then there's the charismatic tragedies with the human phases on them.

09:38.600 --> 09:39.600
I don't know.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.600
What is the most charismatic tragedy?

09:41.600 --> 09:47.600
I mean, let's, let's bring tragedies in terms of charisma.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.600
Well, it's, it's, it's antigeria.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.600
It's the opposite of progeria.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.600
It's old people.

09:53.600 --> 09:59.600
They slowly become so adorable that they die.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.600
It's what's more important.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.600
They get sucked up back inside a uterus.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.600
Yeah.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.600
And it's like, fuck you guys.

10:04.600 --> 10:08.600
But it's very tragic, but you can't tell from looking at it.

10:08.600 --> 10:14.600
I want to bring a friend to the stage because he, he's got a heart in and a heart out.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.600
And he's, he's, he's got a heart in and a heart out.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.600
Yeah.

10:19.600 --> 10:27.600
He's dropping in by parachute and then he's rolling out like on a bayonet.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.600
I don't, I don't do, I don't do good interviews and I don't do good introductions.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.600
Let's just bring him up.

10:32.600 --> 10:48.600
Maniac is here.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.600
Sorry.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.600
Welcome to my poorly formatted show.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
I'm sorry.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.600
Thank you so much.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.600
I listened to yours today.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.600
I listened to episode 11 of your podcast, getting it on with James.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.600
Are you getting on?

10:58.600 --> 10:59.600
Getting on.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.600
Not getting it on.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.600
Getting it on.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
It's very different.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.600
It's called heart in and heart out.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.600
So James abandoned it.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.600
Your most recent episode is lockdown.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.600
And it's, it's true.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.600
It's, it's great.

11:11.600 --> 11:16.600
Like, like, like there's lots of podcasts out there that look super ego comes to mind.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.600
It's just an experience.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.600
Like there are people like me who are just dumping their dumb narcissistic asses into

11:21.600 --> 11:23.600
a microphone and like pumping it out there.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.600
And that's great too.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.600
That's, that's worthy of something.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.600
There's a technique to your neurotic spluttering.

11:28.600 --> 11:33.600
Somehow Bert children are being helped right now by me doing this.

11:33.600 --> 11:39.600
But then there is the actual use of the medium, which is so charismatic and so envy inducing

11:39.600 --> 11:44.260
when I listen to, I listen to that thing and it's fucking fast and tight and amazing and

11:44.260 --> 11:47.600
purely driven by your resonant tones.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.600
You're, you're, you're Dr. Venture from Venture Brothers.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.240
You, you, you, you are a professional voice actor.

11:54.240 --> 11:57.600
You know what's for sale when you talk into a microphone and I'm just.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.600
Thank you, Dan.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.600
Yeah.

11:59.600 --> 12:03.100
And this, and this thing, there's 11 episodes of it.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.600
Please click on them and listen.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.600
It's a fictional podcast.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.600
Yeah.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.600
Tell a little stories in every episode.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.600
Yeah.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.200
It's just like little short plays, but the idea is that it's James Rabani acts podcast,

12:12.200 --> 12:16.600
but each month James Rabani act could be a different character and they give it in circumstances

12:16.600 --> 12:17.600
of his life are completely different.

12:17.600 --> 12:22.800
And so there, it's basically me like talking about stuff, but like sometimes I'm sort of

12:22.800 --> 12:26.600
myself, but like in the one you just listened to, I'm the captain of a spaceship.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.600
Yeah.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.600
And then like this one where I'm a drunken college professor who just got fired.

12:30.600 --> 12:34.600
There's another one where I'm a guy who just experienced a personal tragedy.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.600
Just tying it together with the theme of this show.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.600
Yeah.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.600
And that one gets like really dark and so like, but it started out just because I wanted to

12:41.600 --> 12:45.600
just make something in my house.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.600
That was easy.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.600
I mean, relatively easy to make and just put it out there.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.600
And then I asked a bunch of writer friends to write for it.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.600
And then I've been writing with the right, my writing partner, Brie Williams.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.600
And we've written like three of them so far, including the space one.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.600
That's pretty great.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.600
Easy to, easy to subscribe to.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.600
And yeah.

13:01.600 --> 13:06.600
And it's on the Farrell audio.com with the Harmontown.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.600
It's part of the Farrell family of stars.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.600
You know, there's a lot of very interesting things in the Farrell audio network.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.600
We're doing a new thing where we take a little break and do a Farrell audio.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.600
Oh, I didn't get that the point of that transition.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.600
It's an experimental thing.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.600
It was my idea.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.600
I thought you were sending up that kind of plug.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.600
No, no.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.600
Do you want a musical theme for that?

13:25.600 --> 13:29.600
No, no, I think it's better to just have silence and then you go with that.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
Okay.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.600
Farrell audio.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.600
Let's talk about these kids for a second.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
I mean.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.600
Farrell audio.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.600
Farrell audio.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.600
I mean, sure, if you're a burnt kid.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.600
Farrell audio.

13:41.600 --> 13:45.600
My favorite audio.

13:45.600 --> 13:49.600
And there are groups of people out there who have it worst.

13:49.600 --> 13:56.600
You know, burnt kids and people with tumors and things, but Farrell audio makes no money.

13:56.600 --> 14:01.600
They're just a collective of brilliant people doing podcasting just for the fuck of it.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.600
That's right.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.600
They're good people.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.600
Because young Dustin is about the work.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.600
Yeah.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.600
He just hangs out.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.600
Dustin Marshall everybody.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.600
The founder of Farrell audio.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.600
Only 12 years old.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.600
He's only 12 years old.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.600
People don't know that about Dustin Marshall.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.600
Great Mark Cap and headphones.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.600
He's never without him.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.600
He's like a cartoon character.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
When you take the headphones off.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.600
He was orphaned in 1892.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.600
See him walking up and down Franklin Avenue in his Cap and headphones.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.600
Listening to podcasts.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.600
His life truly, his headstone will say.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.600
Dustin Marshall, Dustin Marshall.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.600
He's a little newsy.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.600
Headphones and a hat.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.600
D.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.600
I was going to do a rap bridge for that.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.600
I do a rap bridge.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.600
D.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.600
To the U.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.600
To the S.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.600
To the T.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.600
To the I.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
To the I.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.600
That's it.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.600
That was your spelling.

14:55.600 --> 15:00.600
That's a very popular rap trope.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.600
Spelling.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.600
But the two though, yeah.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.600
Yeah.

15:05.600 --> 15:10.600
Dustin Marshall's headstone will definitely have the words extra, extra on them.

15:10.600 --> 15:15.600
They'll have little stone headphones over the headstone.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.600
Read all about it.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.600
There'll be real headphones.

15:17.600 --> 15:21.600
You can hear his plaintive wails from beyond the grave.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.600
Yeah, you can put them up.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.600
I'm alive!

15:27.600 --> 15:30.600
Kevin, you rose buds while he made.

15:30.600 --> 15:35.600
I'm down here trying to court Marc Maron.

15:35.600 --> 15:41.600
Marc Maron, did he go over to Marc Maron's grave and he's like, I don't need you.

15:41.600 --> 15:46.600
It's a gold brush right now, the podcast industry.

15:46.600 --> 15:52.600
Erbaniak, you played Crumb in The Moving Arts Splendor.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.600
Yeah, I did.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.600
Yeah, that was exciting.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.600
Was there any direction?

15:58.600 --> 16:00.600
Did you research?

16:00.600 --> 16:05.600
Well, when that audition came in, you know, you audition for these things as an actor

16:05.600 --> 16:08.600
and usually you go, well, I'll do the best I can.

16:08.600 --> 16:14.600
But that audition came in, it was 2001, that audition came in on the answering machine.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.600
We had answering machines back then.

16:16.600 --> 16:21.600
So this is the exposition from your mom when you come in, like your cat woman.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.600
Oh, James, what are you going to make of that girl?

16:24.600 --> 16:26.600
Yeah, exactly, the answering machine trope.

16:26.600 --> 16:31.600
And then they said, you audition with The Moving Arts Splendor to play Robert Crumb

16:31.600 --> 16:33.600
and I thought, that part is mine.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.600
No one else is more qualified.

16:35.600 --> 16:40.600
I'm thin, I'm tall, I'm an amateur cartoonist.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.600
I saw Crumb.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.600
I saw Crumb and I'm a fan of his work.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.600
I have a hat like that.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.600
Was Crumb out, Crumb had been out, did you?

16:48.600 --> 16:52.600
Oh my God, I saw Crumb and it came out, that's a masterpiece, that movie.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.600
Oh, that's amazing.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.600
And then I watched that like a loop, then I auditioned.

16:55.600 --> 17:02.600
No, and the auditions for American Splendor were September 10th, 2001, 9-10.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.600
Then what happened?

17:04.600 --> 17:08.600
Then the callback was like six weeks later.

17:08.600 --> 17:12.600
I had to wait forever.

17:12.600 --> 17:16.600
It's true, the auditions were in downtown New York.

17:16.600 --> 17:20.600
The auditions were in downtown New York at Canal Street at Good Machine

17:20.600 --> 17:23.600
and it was illegal to go downtown for like four weeks.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.600
Yeah, it was fucking terrorists.

17:26.600 --> 17:29.600
They almost fucked up by getting that book.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.600
Was 9-11 an inside job?

17:31.600 --> 17:37.600
I gave you a real good segue there and it's true.

17:37.600 --> 17:41.600
I just watched two documentaries today and I've become, I've gone from...

17:41.600 --> 17:44.600
I walked into the drawing room earlier today and Dan was sitting next to Dino

17:44.600 --> 17:49.600
and Dan was clearly in the middle of a rant about the melting point of steel.

17:49.600 --> 17:50.600
Yes.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.600
I've become one of these people.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.600
Is that conspiracy guy, what's his face?

17:55.600 --> 17:57.600
Barky McGee, you know, the one who's always...

17:57.600 --> 17:58.600
McGrath?

17:58.600 --> 18:00.600
Who's the famous conspiracy guy?

18:00.600 --> 18:01.600
Who's the crime dog?

18:01.600 --> 18:04.600
Alex Jones, thank you. Barky McGee, I call him.

18:04.600 --> 18:08.600
Was he in these documentaries, Alex Jones?

18:08.600 --> 18:10.600
Alex, no, I don't...

18:10.600 --> 18:12.600
Alright, because he just makes the living like making shit up.

18:12.600 --> 18:19.600
But back in the day, anybody who was talking about the boiling point of metal

18:19.600 --> 18:25.600
and the pancake and all this shit, I was so turned off by that stuff

18:25.600 --> 18:29.600
because it was precisely because it was like, you know what, no, there's not a fucking...

18:29.600 --> 18:31.600
I don't want to romanticize this.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.600
This is an actual Jesus Christ.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.600
These people died and it's a fucking big deal

18:35.600 --> 18:39.600
and more importantly, it's about the government's kind of ineptitude.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.600
I wanted to...

18:41.600 --> 18:45.600
I remember being in therapy sessions and saying to therapists, like,

18:45.600 --> 18:47.600
yeah, I'm just angry about this.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.600
These people, they didn't do anything.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.600
We pay our taxes.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.600
You're supposed to be in this no fly zone.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.600
I thought you were supposed to clip your Dilbert cartoons

18:57.600 --> 19:00.600
and have your coupons for cat food.

19:00.600 --> 19:05.600
I thought the whole exchange was supposed to ultimately have to do with security.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.600
But no, you can just go...

19:08.600 --> 19:10.600
I was mad about it back then. I was mad.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.600
And I never wanted to hear anybody saying, like,

19:13.600 --> 19:15.600
well, you know, they never...

19:15.600 --> 19:19.600
like 77 is the kind of metal that on the plane of the tail couldn't have...

19:19.600 --> 19:21.600
I was like, those people are quacks.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.600
I don't want to talk to those people because they're trying to JFK-ify

19:25.600 --> 19:29.600
something that is actually deeply patriotic,

19:29.600 --> 19:33.600
spiritual, like, important, personal.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.600
But now I start just today.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.600
I guess, like, maybe I hit some tipping point or...

19:38.600 --> 19:39.600
I don't know, maybe...

19:39.600 --> 19:40.600
What did you watch?

19:40.600 --> 19:43.600
I watched these just weird documentaries, whatever was available.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.600
I don't know what happened to me today.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.600
I just drifted into some weird cloud.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.600
Maybe it's because of the community.

19:49.600 --> 19:53.600
Like, I was just looking for an escape.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.600
I was looking for the pressures.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.600
You know, I just wanted a Sunday to just, like, escape into a cloud.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.600
You should get fired again.

19:59.600 --> 20:03.600
That would help. That would help.

20:03.600 --> 20:08.600
I watched this documentary called Press for Truth,

20:08.600 --> 20:10.600
I think it was called, or Press...

20:10.600 --> 20:12.600
And then another one that was called Zero.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.600
The latter is the more, like, sci-fi,

20:15.600 --> 20:18.600
kind of like, what's the melting point of steel kind of stuff.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.600
Press for Truth is actually kind of impressive

20:20.600 --> 20:22.600
because it's very deeply personal.

20:22.600 --> 20:27.600
It's about the, like, the wives of victims, like, going,

20:27.600 --> 20:29.600
just, like, on a human level.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.600
They're just going, they're not saying,

20:31.600 --> 20:35.600
I think that spaghetti was the motivation.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.600
Like, they're just saying,

20:37.600 --> 20:39.600
no one's giving us a satisfactory answer.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.600
Anyways, guys, what do you think?

20:41.600 --> 20:43.600
I don't know.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.600
What's their theory?

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
Well, there's a...

20:46.600 --> 20:49.600
In the first one, there was, like, this huge thing about Pakistan.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.600
I'm sorry, the kumail's not here to...

20:52.600 --> 20:54.600
To be bummed out.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.600
There's, like, all this...

20:56.600 --> 20:58.600
I can't keep track of it. Your head starts to spin.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.600
That's the thing that conspiracy theorists have as an advantage.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.600
Is this the thing where they're saying,

21:02.600 --> 21:05.600
oh, well, it was the American government did it themselves?

21:05.600 --> 21:08.600
Well, certainly the second of the two,

21:08.600 --> 21:11.600
the one that's called Zero, yeah, it's all about...

21:11.600 --> 21:14.600
Yeah, absolutely the implication is that it's an inside job.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.600
Dan, if you had to guess right now,

21:16.600 --> 21:18.600
with what limited information and intelligence that you have,

21:18.600 --> 21:20.600
as is my job.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.600
You know what I'm saying?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.600
I'm not saying you have to be right,

21:24.600 --> 21:26.600
but if you had to go from your gut with what facts,

21:26.600 --> 21:28.600
information you currently have,

21:28.600 --> 21:30.600
what do you think happened?

21:30.600 --> 21:34.600
Honestly, I swear to God, I'm not kidding.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.600
Like, I don't... I have no idea.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.600
I don't know. I swear to God.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.600
Do you think a plane hit the Pentagon?

21:40.600 --> 21:42.600
God damn it.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.600
Now I've watched these two things today.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.600
I would have... Yesterday, I would have said...

21:48.600 --> 21:50.600
From your gut, Dan, TMZ is not here.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.600
Yesterday, I would have said, yes, there is no gut.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.600
That's the problem.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.600
Like, there is no... I watched two documentaries today.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.600
Here's the problem with conspiracy theorists.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.600
They're still processing with what's going on.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.600
Conspiracy theorists, like, they're a dangerous...

22:02.600 --> 22:04.600
that's a dangerous industry.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.600
They get to leave out things that don't service them.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.600
Like, there's something marketable about saying

22:08.600 --> 22:11.600
JFK didn't get killed by Lee Harvey Oswald.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.600
That's right. That's why this guy, Alex Jones,

22:13.600 --> 22:15.600
likes the living doing this.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.600
You're incentivized every inch of every magic bullet's pathway.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.600
You're incentivized to fudge, and that's not cool

22:21.600 --> 22:23.600
when you're dealing with stuff that people actually care about.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.600
Would you be more content knowing

22:25.600 --> 22:27.600
that it actually happened as reported

22:27.600 --> 22:30.600
or that there actually was, like, you know,

22:30.600 --> 22:32.600
a hocus pocus going on with the government?

22:32.600 --> 22:34.600
I would actually... I would be way more sad.

22:34.600 --> 22:37.600
I would... I would... I hope to God

22:37.600 --> 22:41.600
that 19 fundamentalists,

22:41.600 --> 22:44.600
the guys from Saudi Arabia,

22:44.600 --> 22:46.600
climbed into planes and did horrible things

22:46.600 --> 22:48.600
and flew them into things, and that that was that.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.600
I would... I would... I so would much rather

22:51.600 --> 22:53.600
life be that... like that.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.600
I... I... these... these... these things take you down a rabbit hole, though.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.600
You just go, like, you're so unsatisfied by that truth.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.600
James, this is the point in the show

23:01.600 --> 23:03.600
where the guest has to start interviewing Dan.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.600
James, what do you think? James, come on, tell us.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.600
James, James, tell us.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.600
Well, the government...

23:08.600 --> 23:10.600
You're Dr. Venture. What do you think?

23:10.600 --> 23:15.600
9-11!

23:15.600 --> 23:17.600
Was an inside job.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.600
See? See.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.600
Dr. Venture doesn't say see.

23:21.600 --> 23:26.600
I think, uh, the government already...

23:26.600 --> 23:28.600
Well, the people in power already had a wet dream

23:28.600 --> 23:30.600
for many years that some tragic event

23:30.600 --> 23:32.600
would happen that would allow them

23:32.600 --> 23:34.600
to go off preemptively, knocking off,

23:34.600 --> 23:36.600
like, dictators and stuff.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.600
And so... and you know, there's this thing

23:38.600 --> 23:40.600
called the Project for the New American Century, which...

23:40.600 --> 23:41.600
What?

23:41.600 --> 23:43.600
PNAC.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
Yeah, exactly.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.600
Yeah, those are the letters that...

23:46.600 --> 23:48.600
It's like we're in Washington Square Park here.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.600
And there's a thing in there that says

23:50.600 --> 23:52.600
we really want to go off and, you know,

23:52.600 --> 23:54.600
knock off dictators,

23:54.600 --> 23:56.600
but we need... we need a really good incentive to do it.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.600
We need, like, a Pearl Harbor.

23:58.600 --> 23:59.600
And then...

23:59.600 --> 24:02.600
And then in September 2001, Christmas came early

24:02.600 --> 24:04.600
to the people who wrote that document.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.600
So I can see why you can kind of conflate

24:06.600 --> 24:08.600
that desire and

24:08.600 --> 24:10.600
change it around a little bit

24:10.600 --> 24:12.600
and say those people made that happen,

24:12.600 --> 24:14.600
but they didn't, although they were wishing for it.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.600
Except that no dictators ever get knocked off

24:16.600 --> 24:18.600
and the economy is not booming and there is no...

24:18.600 --> 24:20.600
Like, I could see how those guys would...

24:20.600 --> 24:22.600
That would be their wet dream, but I don't think they engineered it.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.600
No, I don't think they engineered it either.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.600
Because, obviously, it did not work out.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.600
I mean, GW was... he's not acting that he's shocked.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.600
He's just sitting in a fucking kindergarten class

24:30.600 --> 24:32.600
for like 10 minutes going, I don't know what to do.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.600
I honestly don't know what to do.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.600
This is never...

24:36.600 --> 24:38.600
I never thought it would lead up to this.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.600
All I can do is sit here for 10 minutes.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.600
As sexy as all conspiracy theories are

24:42.600 --> 24:44.600
and seem, and you watch these very convincing

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
documentaries about, like,

24:46.600 --> 24:48.600
hey, man, if the planes hit the Pentagon,

24:48.600 --> 24:50.600
where's the engines, Jack?

24:50.600 --> 24:52.600
Man, because the engines will be there

24:52.600 --> 24:54.600
because I made a titanium, my man.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.600
Oh, shit, where are the engines?

24:56.600 --> 24:58.600
That's all cool, but I don't think that's endowing

24:58.600 --> 25:00.600
our government with better abilities

25:00.600 --> 25:02.600
to keep secrets and lie.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.600
They might actually be so inept.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.600
Lies that complicated seem absurd.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.600
Also, yeah, to do that much weird shit

25:08.600 --> 25:10.600
was like, in your wildest dreams,

25:10.600 --> 25:12.600
this government would be capable of...

25:12.600 --> 25:14.600
Being a good government!

25:14.600 --> 25:16.600
...searcheuitists like stuff, and then they're like,

25:16.600 --> 25:18.600
well, if they had that much brain power,

25:18.600 --> 25:20.600
the British wouldn't fall down

25:20.600 --> 25:22.600
while people were fucking driving across them.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.600
Maybe it's just that when horrible shit happens,

25:24.600 --> 25:26.600
it's always chaotic.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.600
You always wonder how a piece of skull

25:28.600 --> 25:30.600
ended up on one wall.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.600
It never makes sense.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.600
And then you have 10 years to...

25:34.600 --> 25:36.600
What wall are you talking about?

25:38.600 --> 25:40.600
It's a metaphorical wall

25:40.600 --> 25:42.600
of order in the wake of chaos.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.600
Like Pink Floyd.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.600
Pink Floyd wall. It's not a real wall.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.600
A beloved president is assassinated.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.600
Two towers come crumbling down.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.600
Like, in a flash,

25:54.600 --> 25:56.600
our world changes, and then we spend the next 15 years

25:56.600 --> 25:58.600
going like, okay, well...

25:58.600 --> 26:00.600
You find a candy wrapper on the floor,

26:00.600 --> 26:02.600
and you trace it back

26:02.600 --> 26:04.600
to the idea that, hopefully,

26:04.600 --> 26:06.600
there's more order than chaos in the world.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.600
But the truth is,

26:08.600 --> 26:10.600
boy, but man, I learned a lot about

26:10.600 --> 26:12.600
metallurgy today.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.600
They didn't let up!

26:14.600 --> 26:16.600
They didn't let up!

26:16.600 --> 26:18.600
I think you're receptive to these alternative histories,

26:18.600 --> 26:20.600
and it's like, you're receptive to it because

26:20.600 --> 26:22.600
they're stories, and you adore stories,

26:22.600 --> 26:24.600
and you pay all stories respect.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.600
They're terrible stories, though.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.600
But we crave

26:28.600 --> 26:30.600
sense.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.600
We want order.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.600
We'll never know

26:34.600 --> 26:36.600
lots of things about history,

26:36.600 --> 26:38.600
but we choose to make

26:38.600 --> 26:40.600
order out of things, out of chaos.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.600
We know why it happened, and it still doesn't make any sense.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.600
I'm going to go home

26:44.600 --> 26:46.600
and Google

26:46.600 --> 26:48.600
the right phrase for debunking

26:48.600 --> 26:50.600
the debunking of the debunking and stuff,

26:50.600 --> 26:52.600
because I just heard too much today

26:52.600 --> 26:54.600
about the melting point of steel.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.600
It just disturbed me too much.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.600
I want you to have another vodka,

26:58.600 --> 27:00.600
and just fucking dive into a real conspiracy right now.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
I want you to like...

27:02.600 --> 27:04.600
I see your leg tapping

27:04.600 --> 27:06.600
eagerly right now. I think you're on a threshold

27:06.600 --> 27:08.600
of really revealing.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.600
Yeah, America wasn't in those buildings.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.600
They evacuated them.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.600
I don't know what you're talking about.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.600
Alright.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.600
Don't chicken out me now, man.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.600
I think you have your own...

27:20.600 --> 27:22.600
Look, I am a human being.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.600
The most amazing thing was that

27:24.600 --> 27:26.600
there was one guy in both documentaries I saw.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.600
There's like these little cheesy videos

27:28.600 --> 27:30.600
that people make.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.600
There's one guy in both of them,

27:32.600 --> 27:34.600
whose son died in 9-11,

27:34.600 --> 27:36.600
and I loved his catchphrase

27:36.600 --> 27:38.600
in the second of the two documentaries.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.600
He was like...

27:40.600 --> 27:42.600
He's like this good-natured

27:42.600 --> 27:44.600
dad that was talking

27:44.600 --> 27:46.600
the way I hope my dad would talk

27:46.600 --> 27:48.600
if I died

27:48.600 --> 27:50.600
in a horrible tragedy

27:50.600 --> 27:52.600
that didn't have an abundance

27:52.600 --> 27:54.600
of forensic evidence surrounding it.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.600
He just said,

27:56.600 --> 27:58.600
hey, look, I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.600
My son got murdered.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.600
I'm trying to find out who killed him.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.600
It's fucking like,

28:04.600 --> 28:06.600
really completely...

28:06.600 --> 28:08.600
I was like, shit,

28:08.600 --> 28:10.600
I want that to be my dad.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.600
And I will do that for my son.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.600
Can you dedicate an entire season

28:14.600 --> 28:16.600
of community to answering my question?

28:16.600 --> 28:18.600
No, no, no.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.600
What if you did that?

28:20.600 --> 28:22.600
It just takes a turn.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.600
Donald Glover leaves,

28:24.600 --> 28:26.600
and then there's this plane hits Greendale,

28:26.600 --> 28:28.600
and then...

28:28.600 --> 28:30.600
It's a paper airplane, so it's charming.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.600
It's like a paintball plane.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.600
I dare you.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.600
I, Jeff Davis, dare you, dad.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.600
It's just the season of paintball.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.600
Is there any way I can make people happy

28:46.600 --> 28:48.600
with 13 episodes, speaking of which?

28:48.600 --> 28:50.600
I don't know, man.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.600
All paintball.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.600
What if all paintball?

28:54.600 --> 28:56.600
That wouldn't make people happy.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.600
What if no paintball? That wouldn't make people happy.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.600
I'm not complaining,

29:00.600 --> 29:02.600
but I am under a personal gun.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.600
What would you do

29:04.600 --> 29:06.600
if you had...

29:06.600 --> 29:08.600
Now that budget is a concern, necessarily,

29:08.600 --> 29:10.600
but if you had your dream,

29:10.600 --> 29:12.600
have there been ideas kicked around

29:12.600 --> 29:14.600
in the writer's room

29:14.600 --> 29:16.600
where you would say,

29:16.600 --> 29:18.600
what if we could just do this?

29:18.600 --> 29:20.600
What would be one thing you wish you could do

29:20.600 --> 29:22.600
but you can't get away with it?

29:22.600 --> 29:24.600
What if Donald was in the show?

29:24.600 --> 29:26.600
Just keep...

29:26.600 --> 29:28.600
It's just been five weeks of us going...

29:30.600 --> 29:32.600
No, no, no, nothing like that, honestly.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.600
I mean, I never...

29:34.600 --> 29:36.600
No, I want to re-ground the characters

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
and do awesome, compelling shit.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.600
I think every

29:40.600 --> 29:42.600
kind of community fan

29:42.600 --> 29:44.600
would agree that

29:44.600 --> 29:46.600
remedial chaos and Dungeons & Dragons

29:46.600 --> 29:48.600
are at the center of the Venn diagram

29:48.600 --> 29:50.600
of everybody being happy.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.600
The shippers are happy.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.600
The psychology is there.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.600
Paintball is awesome,

29:56.600 --> 29:58.600
but that's like a slight off-shoot

29:58.600 --> 30:00.600
of episodes that are...

30:00.600 --> 30:02.600
You have to take the character seriously.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.600
And of course, we're going to do that

30:04.600 --> 30:06.600
for the fifth season.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.600
I'm not that worried.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.600
I'm just a little worried that you only get 13

30:10.600 --> 30:12.600
and I'm worried.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.600
Okay, I'm worried.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.600
How many have you written so far?

30:16.600 --> 30:18.600
Zero.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.600
I've taken up heroin

30:20.600 --> 30:22.600
and I'm just sitting in my office.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.600
I just keep staring

30:24.600 --> 30:26.600
at old Vanity Fair articles about the show.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.600
I'm just eating

30:28.600 --> 30:30.600
grilled octopus

30:30.600 --> 30:32.600
and shooting up.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.600
No, we've broken

30:34.600 --> 30:36.600
like five episodes,

30:36.600 --> 30:38.600
like broken the stories.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.600
All right. Why do you ask James?

30:40.600 --> 30:42.600
I was just curious. Do you want to be in one of them?

30:42.600 --> 30:44.600
Please, if there's a part for a persnickety...

30:46.600 --> 30:48.600
All right, James,

30:48.600 --> 30:50.600
we've got to let James go,

30:50.600 --> 30:52.600
but before we do, we've got to...

30:52.600 --> 30:54.600
If there's a persnickety passive-aggressive

30:54.600 --> 30:56.600
professor who makes his way through there

30:56.600 --> 30:58.600
who has an affair with Britta, you know, that's...

30:58.600 --> 31:00.600
We'll throw that out there.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.600
It's that easy.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.600
Yeah, just to throw that out there.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.600
Yeah, anyone in the water side.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.600
It's a 9-11, guys. You don't have to take it to heart.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.600
Just throwing it out, opening a door in your mind.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.600
Anything you want to plug or anything?

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
Well, you're up here?

31:14.600 --> 31:16.600
I don't know. Are you writing a book

31:16.600 --> 31:18.600
or appearing in a magazine or...

31:18.600 --> 31:20.600
I don't know. I was just like...

31:20.600 --> 31:22.600
Stuff, but the Venture Brothers,

31:22.600 --> 31:24.600
just listen to the podcast.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.600
Getting On with James Rabaniya

31:26.600 --> 31:28.600
at ferrelodeo.com. Definitely listen to it.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.600
Thank you, James Rabaniya.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.600
Thank you for having me.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.600
Yay!

31:34.600 --> 31:36.600
James Rabaniya.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.600
James Rabaniya.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.600
I don't know what I'm doing.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.600
It wasn't out of my outline.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.600
It was like, bring James Rabaniya out,

31:52.600 --> 31:54.600
then ask him if 9-11 wasn't it such a...

31:54.600 --> 31:56.600
And then...

31:56.600 --> 31:58.600
And then never ask him another question.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.600
Of all the people that you've not interviewed

32:02.600 --> 32:04.600
while they're out here, he took it the best.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.600
He's a good sport.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.600
I mean, if he wants to stay, he can stay,

32:08.600 --> 32:10.600
but he had a hard out.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.600
Yeah, I'm a bad...

32:12.600 --> 32:14.600
I'm a bad interviewer.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.600
I've been forthcoming about that.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.600
What do you think is your...

32:18.600 --> 32:20.600
What keeps you from being a good interviewer?

32:20.600 --> 32:22.600
Concern?

32:22.600 --> 32:24.600
About other people?

32:24.600 --> 32:26.600
That's not true. You are concerned about the people,

32:26.600 --> 32:28.600
but you get more concerned...

32:28.600 --> 32:30.600
I'm concerned about how they feel about me.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.600
You start interviewing yourself through their eyes.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.600
Yeah.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.600
It's like, if Gore Vidal came up here,

32:36.600 --> 32:38.600
I'd be like,

32:38.600 --> 32:40.600
is there mustard on my...

32:40.600 --> 32:42.600
Bring somebody up in the audience right now

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
and interview him. Just try to interview him.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.600
Okay. This guy is so excited.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.600
Okay.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.600
What's your name, sir?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.600
Gibran.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.600
Where are you from, Gibran?

33:00.600 --> 33:02.600
I came down from Canada.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.600
I drove down.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.600
Today? Yeah, today.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.600
It was just a straight... No.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.600
I drove down this week. It was about 30 hours.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.600
Which province are you from?

33:12.600 --> 33:14.600
Alberta.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.600
Yeah, exactly.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.600
Fuck you, Gibran. Get out of here.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.600
It's done.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.600
What's your birthstone?

33:22.600 --> 33:24.600
Garnet? Okay.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.600
What's left for me?

33:26.600 --> 33:28.600
Take it from there.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.600
Gibran, how tall was your mom?

33:34.600 --> 33:36.600
5'1".

33:36.600 --> 33:38.600
See? I don't know.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.600
You're taller than 5'1".

33:40.600 --> 33:42.600
Dan, a stranger is on stage with you right now.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.600
You've never met this tall.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.600
He raised his hand eagerly.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.600
What...

33:48.600 --> 33:50.600
Is there no drive?

33:50.600 --> 33:52.600
Gibran, Gibran.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.600
You're from Canada. I am.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.600
Your name's Gibran.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.600
How long are you in town?

34:02.600 --> 34:04.600
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.600
Why?

34:06.600 --> 34:08.600
Because once I've seen this,

34:08.600 --> 34:10.600
what else is there to do?

34:12.600 --> 34:14.600
I'm a good interviewer. Thank you.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.600
Thank you.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.600
Hey, Gibran,

34:18.600 --> 34:20.600
what's with the weird name?

34:20.600 --> 34:22.600
Uh...

34:22.600 --> 34:24.600
Wow.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.600
It's a gotcha question, Dan.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.600
Fair question, let's say.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.600
Is that a common name? What part of Canada?

34:30.600 --> 34:32.600
Calgary. Calgary, Alberta.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.600
Alright, I've got a lot of people.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.600
Okay.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.600
Alright, forget your name. Don't worry about that.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.600
Don't worry about that. That's stupid.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.600
Google his name. Who cares?

34:42.600 --> 34:44.600
Gibran, what are you most afraid of?

34:44.600 --> 34:46.600
Don't say spiders.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.600
Slipping into solipsism?

34:48.600 --> 34:50.600
Is that okay?

34:50.600 --> 34:52.600
Like me?

34:52.600 --> 34:54.600
So you'd be a bad interviewer?

34:54.600 --> 34:56.600
Probably.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.600
Alright, now Gibran,

34:58.600 --> 35:00.600
interview Dan.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.600
Act like you don't know me.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.600
You can act like you know me.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.600
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to control the interview.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.600
When two solipsists go to war,

35:14.600 --> 35:16.600
yeah.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.600
Both guys just look at the floor.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.600
I'm sorry.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.600
I'm sorry about my friend.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.600
Tell me what it felt like

35:24.600 --> 35:26.600
to play D&D for the first time.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.600
Oh my god.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.600
That's a great question, Gibran.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.600
Thank you. I love D&D.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.600
Oh yeah? Yes.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.600
I mean, I honestly,

35:36.600 --> 35:38.600
I can barely remember,

35:38.600 --> 35:40.600
but one of the most remarkable memories

35:40.600 --> 35:42.600
I have that marked that is that

35:42.600 --> 35:44.600
I remember mowing my lawn

35:46.600 --> 35:48.600
because I had to mow my lawn,

35:48.600 --> 35:50.600
and I remember that I hated mowing the lawn

35:50.600 --> 35:52.600
because it was just repetitive activity,

35:52.600 --> 35:54.600
but this is before iPods,

35:54.600 --> 35:56.600
it's before you can occupy your brain with anything,

35:56.600 --> 35:58.600
and I just remember mowing

35:58.600 --> 36:00.600
my suburban front lawn

36:00.600 --> 36:02.600
going back and forth,

36:02.600 --> 36:04.600
and the whole time I was just thinking about

36:04.600 --> 36:06.600
what we had just done in D&D.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.600
So this awakening, this idea

36:10.600 --> 36:12.600
that I had a different life,

36:12.600 --> 36:14.600
that I was a different person,

36:14.600 --> 36:16.600
and that these things had happened,

36:16.600 --> 36:18.600
that they were scenes like in a movie

36:18.600 --> 36:20.600
that had never existed.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.600
That was a good question.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.600
What a good interviewer.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.600
Now tell me.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.600
Now let me counter with this.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.600
What's your favorite color?

36:30.600 --> 36:32.600
Blue.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.600
No pink.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.600
Sorry, I know we're not

36:36.600 --> 36:38.600
supposed to do Monty Python jokes.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.600
That's fine.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.600
What's it like to interview me?

36:42.600 --> 36:44.600
Dan, follow up question.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.600
Why do you like D&D?

36:46.600 --> 36:48.600
How old are you?

36:48.600 --> 36:50.600
What race do you hate the most?

36:52.600 --> 36:54.600
Which feet of yours is bigger?

36:54.600 --> 36:56.600
I hate gnomes.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.600
You're an elf.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.600
How old are you?

37:02.600 --> 37:04.600
35.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.600
You answered the same question.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.600
What was your big memory with D&D?

37:08.600 --> 37:10.600
Really, that was just so that I could

37:10.600 --> 37:12.600
answer that question.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.600
I played for the first time when I was nine,

37:18.600 --> 37:20.600
and I actually didn't even know

37:20.600 --> 37:22.600
that I was playing Dungeons & Dragons.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.600
It just came in this little red box,

37:24.600 --> 37:26.600
and a guy across the street from a friend,

37:26.600 --> 37:28.600
he played this game,

37:28.600 --> 37:30.600
and I had no idea that you could

37:30.600 --> 37:32.600
just

37:32.600 --> 37:34.600
envelop yourself in another world

37:34.600 --> 37:36.600
and create all these things that

37:36.600 --> 37:38.600
were so alien

37:38.600 --> 37:40.600
to the life that you live.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.600
The idea that it's actually okay

37:42.600 --> 37:44.600
to say

37:44.600 --> 37:46.600
even though

37:46.600 --> 37:48.600
I'm just sitting here being a fat guy

37:48.600 --> 37:50.600
with zits on his face,

37:50.600 --> 37:52.600
I'm actually doing this other thing.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.600
I'm actually this other person.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.600
We're all familiar with it.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.600
It's under our nose, but the emotional

37:58.600 --> 38:00.600
experience of

38:00.600 --> 38:02.600
actually...

38:02.600 --> 38:04.600
I mean, allowing yourself

38:04.600 --> 38:06.600
to be heroic

38:06.600 --> 38:08.600
or be the center of your own

38:08.600 --> 38:10.600
universe. I mean, I guess we all are

38:10.600 --> 38:12.600
the center of your own universes, but

38:12.600 --> 38:14.600
it's

38:14.600 --> 38:16.600
on a grander scale.

38:16.600 --> 38:18.600
So what do they do in Canada?

38:22.600 --> 38:24.600
Just on a typical day.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.600
It's eight in the morning.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.600
I'll be a Canadian rooster,

38:30.600 --> 38:32.600
and I'm sure it sounds different from

38:32.600 --> 38:34.600
an American rooster.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.600
I'm sure it's got some

38:40.600 --> 38:42.600
weird use of you in there.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.600
You all wake up and go,

38:46.600 --> 38:48.600
I'm about to eat some breakfast.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.600
We watch hockey.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.600
We wake up, we turn on the TV,

38:58.600 --> 39:00.600
there's no

39:00.600 --> 39:02.600
channel changing on the remote.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.600
It turns on and off, and then it's just

39:04.600 --> 39:06.600
TV at a really loud volume.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.600
Straight hockey at a really loud

39:08.600 --> 39:10.600
volume.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.600
Or hockey.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.600
I feel like every time,

39:14.600 --> 39:16.600
everything I've ever seen on the internet that I was

39:16.600 --> 39:18.600
community related, where someone's

39:18.600 --> 39:20.600
making a really creative gift or doing

39:20.600 --> 39:22.600
a good YouTube video, there's always that

39:22.600 --> 39:24.600
city TV logo.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.600
And that's Canadian, right?

39:26.600 --> 39:28.600
You're not paying for anything.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.600
We're really great at pirating.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.600
But, you also,

39:32.600 --> 39:34.600
you know, you love

39:34.600 --> 39:36.600
good TV?

39:36.600 --> 39:38.600
And by good, I mean

39:38.600 --> 39:40.600
my.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.600
We know that what you meant.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.600
Are you born and raised in Calgary?

39:46.600 --> 39:48.600
Yeah, I am. What's that street? Is 17th Street

39:48.600 --> 39:50.600
where the bars are? 17th Ave.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.600
That's right. Were you there?

39:52.600 --> 39:54.600
Oh yeah. Oh wow. Many times.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.600
And is the bar called like the Crown and Thorn?

39:56.600 --> 39:58.600
Rosen Crown.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.600
That's Alberta?

40:00.600 --> 40:02.600
That's right, Alberta.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.600
I have relatives.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.600
I had a family reunion in Alberta.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.600
Oh really? Just so you know.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.600
Where? I don't know. I didn't go.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.600
Oh.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.600
A bunch of people

40:16.600 --> 40:18.600
related to me were like, hey, come up here.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.600
If you ever need a

40:20.600 --> 40:22.600
surrogate to go for the next one, you just

40:22.600 --> 40:24.600
I'll send you.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.600
Now Dan, there was a lady running around.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.600
My parents went and they said,

40:28.600 --> 40:30.600
God, I'm so annoying. There was this lady running around

40:30.600 --> 40:32.600
and talking about how

40:32.600 --> 40:34.600
we were all

40:34.600 --> 40:36.600
six degrees

40:36.600 --> 40:38.600
separated from a pope.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.600
And my mom was like,

40:40.600 --> 40:42.600
we all are. Like everyone is.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.600
Like, cavemen are.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.600
Now Dan, we're learning more about you

40:46.600 --> 40:48.600
in this interview than Gibran.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.600
We cannot leave, we cannot get him

40:50.600 --> 40:52.600
off the stage until we've learned

40:52.600 --> 40:54.600
at least equal amounts about Gibran before he goes.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.600
Okay. I'll leave that to you.

40:56.600 --> 40:58.600
So people who are listening to the podcast

40:58.600 --> 41:00.600
at home, we haven't specified yet.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.600
Gibran is a seven foot two

41:02.600 --> 41:04.600
African-American.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.600
Tattooed like Quique Wagon,

41:08.600 --> 41:10.600
Mubby Dick.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.600
He has tribal tats over the left side of his face.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.600
He's holding an ivory spear.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.600
Purple streak to it.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.600
I have something to say about that

41:18.600 --> 41:20.600
because my fiance,

41:20.600 --> 41:22.600
when she meets new people

41:22.600 --> 41:24.600
and they ask about me,

41:24.600 --> 41:26.600
then she says, oh, his name is Gibran.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.600
They're always like, oh, he must be big and black.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.600
They're so disappointed

41:30.600 --> 41:32.600
when they see me.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.600
Dan, follow up questions.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.600
If you were black,

41:40.600 --> 41:46.600
like, what would you do first?

41:48.600 --> 41:50.600
And last.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.600
Because for real, I would go,

41:54.600 --> 41:56.600
Jeff, let's all answer this question.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.600
If you could, if you woke up

41:58.600 --> 42:00.600
tomorrow black,

42:00.600 --> 42:02.600
like, there's something you do, right?

42:04.600 --> 42:06.600
I would instantly go fuck with white people

42:06.600 --> 42:08.600
as hard as I could.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.600
How? Where?

42:10.600 --> 42:12.600
I would just good-naturedly intimidate them.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.600
I was about to say,

42:16.600 --> 42:18.600
I would go to some mythical place

42:18.600 --> 42:20.600
where only black people are allowed,

42:20.600 --> 42:22.600
but that wouldn't...

42:22.600 --> 42:24.600
This doesn't work that way.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.600
It's called prison.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.600
Good night, everybody.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.600
You fucking pussies.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.600
He walked into that.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.600
It's not like there's some bar

42:38.600 --> 42:40.600
that's called the black gentleman.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.600
We live in Los Angeles.

42:42.600 --> 42:44.600
There are neighborhoods where you could go into

42:44.600 --> 42:46.600
where there are places that you could...

42:46.600 --> 42:48.600
There's places where if I walked in being white

42:48.600 --> 42:50.600
I would feel less comfortable,

42:50.600 --> 42:52.600
but I don't think if you walked in being black

42:52.600 --> 42:54.600
you'd be like, hey, put it on my tab.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.600
Would you walk into a bar

42:56.600 --> 42:58.600
and angle it and try to...

42:58.600 --> 43:00.600
I don't know from angle what.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.600
That's my thing.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.600
I don't know...

43:04.600 --> 43:06.600
I haven't put that much thought into it.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.600
I just know that there's...

43:08.600 --> 43:10.600
If I walked into a place

43:10.600 --> 43:12.600
and everyone was black and I was the only white guy,

43:12.600 --> 43:14.600
I know that I would feel

43:14.600 --> 43:16.600
like an interloper

43:16.600 --> 43:18.600
and bummed out.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.600
But I know from going to junior high

43:20.600 --> 43:22.600
that they

43:22.600 --> 43:24.600
were not as bummed out about that

43:24.600 --> 43:26.600
as a bunch of white people

43:26.600 --> 43:28.600
with a black person walking in would be.

43:28.600 --> 43:30.600
So what would you do?

43:30.600 --> 43:32.600
I don't think there would be any profit from walking it.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.600
I guess I'm just thinking about it now.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.600
If I woke up black, if I had the superpower,

43:36.600 --> 43:38.600
press a button on my bracelet.

43:38.600 --> 43:40.600
First of all, okay, I'm black now.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.600
I'm black.

43:42.600 --> 43:44.600
When you wake up black,

43:44.600 --> 43:46.600
you get to pick what kind of black person you are.

43:46.600 --> 43:48.600
Well, then I'd be super sexy black.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.600
Well, that's a different thing.

43:50.600 --> 43:52.600
I'm assuming I'm a dumpy black guy.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.600
How about you get to be any black person you want?

43:56.600 --> 43:58.600
Male, female, sexy, otherwise?

43:58.600 --> 44:00.600
So I just get to be just straight up

44:00.600 --> 44:02.600
the most black guy in the world?

44:02.600 --> 44:04.600
Or you could be like a funny

44:04.600 --> 44:06.600
wisecrackin' old 50 year old black lady.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.600
I would just be a strapping

44:08.600 --> 44:10.600
fucking amazing black guy

44:10.600 --> 44:12.600
that was able to jump over a car.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.600
What do you...

44:14.600 --> 44:16.600
I'm choosing?

44:16.600 --> 44:18.600
You get to choose.

44:18.600 --> 44:20.600
Well, then I'm mega black.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.600
I'm super, super

44:24.600 --> 44:26.600
in the James Bond of black men.

44:26.600 --> 44:28.600
I'm Billy Dee Williams

44:28.600 --> 44:30.600
in 1982.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.600
I'm just walking in

44:32.600 --> 44:34.600
fucking like...

44:34.600 --> 44:36.600
So you're Billy Dee Williams, sexy,

44:36.600 --> 44:38.600
Billy Dee Williams, where do you...

44:38.600 --> 44:40.600
He's not even black enough. I don't even know where I am.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.600
Hey, fuck you people!

44:42.600 --> 44:44.600
Fuck you, honkeys!

44:44.600 --> 44:46.600
I just pressed my black button.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.600
I'll tell you who's black enough.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.600
Billy Dee can go fuck himself.

44:52.600 --> 44:54.600
What are you talking about? I'm gonna be a fucking rich,

44:54.600 --> 44:56.600
visceral fucking black guy.

44:56.600 --> 44:58.600
So Dan, you're

44:58.600 --> 45:00.600
mega black.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.600
You're super fucking potent black.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.600
Okay.

45:04.600 --> 45:06.600
It's cock-a-doodle-doo.

45:06.600 --> 45:08.600
Alarm clock goes off. What do you do first?

45:08.600 --> 45:10.600
You get up, you have a... I eat a big black breakfast.

45:10.600 --> 45:12.600
Right.

45:12.600 --> 45:14.600
Which consists of what?

45:14.600 --> 45:16.600
Just like, tons of protein

45:16.600 --> 45:18.600
and...

45:18.600 --> 45:20.600
I don't know.

45:20.600 --> 45:22.600
I'm so glad you're asking these questions. I don't know.

45:22.600 --> 45:24.600
What's on your plan about...

45:24.600 --> 45:26.600
You only have 24 hours of this.

45:26.600 --> 45:28.600
Okay, well, I'm so much pressure.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.600
I...

45:30.600 --> 45:32.600
I go to some...

45:32.600 --> 45:34.600
There's gotta be some black parlor where you can

45:34.600 --> 45:36.600
download with other black people about what you do.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.600
I don't know.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.600
I don't know.

45:40.600 --> 45:42.600
You don't have that. You are just a white man.

45:42.600 --> 45:44.600
I'm at my house.

45:44.600 --> 45:46.600
Oh my god, I'm a sexy,

45:46.600 --> 45:48.600
physically fit, beautiful black man.

45:48.600 --> 45:50.600
Alright, so Aaron's next to me?

45:50.600 --> 45:52.600
So then, this is your fantasy, man.

45:52.600 --> 45:54.600
Well, Aaron's like,

45:54.600 --> 45:56.600
Oh shit, you're black. I'm like, yeah.

45:56.600 --> 45:58.600
We probably gotta...

45:58.600 --> 46:00.600
How does she know it's...

46:00.600 --> 46:02.600
How does she know it's...

46:02.600 --> 46:04.600
Don't you...

46:04.600 --> 46:06.600
Is that wrong to say?

46:06.600 --> 46:08.600
Well, when you say knock that out,

46:08.600 --> 46:10.600
what are we talking about?

46:10.600 --> 46:12.600
Well, I mean, if she woke up with blue hair,

46:12.600 --> 46:14.600
it'd be like, hey, you know...

46:14.600 --> 46:16.600
Oh, Viva la de France, you know.

46:16.600 --> 46:18.600
Let's fucking do it.

46:18.600 --> 46:20.600
So we're assuming she wakes up and she's comfortable

46:20.600 --> 46:22.600
to recognize through physical...

46:22.600 --> 46:24.600
Because again, you said,

46:24.600 --> 46:26.600
I'm not the Dan Harmon version of a black guy.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.600
I'm not, you're...

46:28.600 --> 46:30.600
I'm not like a big, dumpy...

46:30.600 --> 46:32.600
I got to choose to be a...

46:32.600 --> 46:34.600
I have a wing span.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.600
Yeah.

46:36.600 --> 46:38.600
My chest is like a Buick's grill.

46:38.600 --> 46:40.600
My biceps are the size of a child's head.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.600
I'm like, every...

46:44.600 --> 46:46.600
I just look like a cartoon.

46:46.600 --> 46:50.600
That's what you think black people are...

46:50.600 --> 46:52.600
No. That's not fair.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.600
There are people...

46:54.600 --> 46:56.600
No, it isn't fair.

46:56.600 --> 46:58.600
You said I got to choose

46:58.600 --> 47:00.600
what kind of black guy I was.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.600
You think children's heads are shaped like biceps?

47:04.600 --> 47:06.600
You know...

47:06.600 --> 47:08.600
I don't want you to be a black person, dad.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.600
Well, I don't...

47:10.600 --> 47:12.600
Okay, so you wake up and you're Kevin Garnett.

47:12.600 --> 47:14.600
You're fucking...

47:14.600 --> 47:16.600
Okay, now we learn more about you.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.600
You said...

47:18.600 --> 47:20.600
You're just a very tall,

47:20.600 --> 47:22.600
physically fit, strapping,

47:22.600 --> 47:24.600
good-looking black gentleman.

47:24.600 --> 47:26.600
You have 24 hours to do something.

47:26.600 --> 47:28.600
What's on the fucking docket?

47:28.600 --> 47:30.600
I fuck Erin, but good.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.600
She's earned it.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.600
Quick breakfast.

47:38.600 --> 47:40.600
Like, high protein.

47:40.600 --> 47:42.600
I don't know what.

47:42.600 --> 47:44.600
Out to my car.

47:46.600 --> 47:48.600
You get to pick a car, too.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.600
You get to pick a new car.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.600
No, because you're trying to trick me into being racist.

47:58.600 --> 48:00.600
And I'm not.

48:00.600 --> 48:02.600
Well done, my proud newbie and friend.

48:02.600 --> 48:04.600
I go down to my fucking silver Prius.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.600
Okay.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.600
And I slide into it proudly with my

48:08.600 --> 48:12.600
cosmopolitan black body.

48:12.600 --> 48:14.600
And I go to the drawing room, my usual haunt,

48:14.600 --> 48:16.600
because I want to know what it's like

48:16.600 --> 48:18.600
to walk in there black.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.600
And I order my usual drink.

48:20.600 --> 48:22.600
I would like a

48:22.600 --> 48:24.600
Kettle One of the Rocks, please.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.600
And a suave like that.

48:26.600 --> 48:28.600
Okay, here you are. That'll be $6.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.600
Thank you.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.600
It's good to drink at a place that understands me.

48:36.600 --> 48:38.600
I don't know, just feeling them out.

48:38.600 --> 48:40.600
Okay.

48:40.600 --> 48:42.600
So let's say they're totally fine.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.600
I go over to the jukebox.

48:44.600 --> 48:46.600
I want to put on some little wing.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.600
Little or little?

48:50.600 --> 48:52.600
Because there's no little

48:52.600 --> 48:54.600
wing on the jukebox.

48:54.600 --> 48:56.600
I'm not going to fuck around with the jukebox.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.600
I don't care. That was a joke.

48:58.600 --> 49:00.600
So I got to drink up my usual haunt.

49:00.600 --> 49:02.600
All right, now what am I going to do?

49:02.600 --> 49:04.600
24 hours.

49:04.600 --> 49:06.600
21 hours.

49:06.600 --> 49:08.600
All right, I'm black.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.600
But I look good.

49:10.600 --> 49:12.600
I'm like fit.

49:12.600 --> 49:14.600
Like I'm ripped.

49:14.600 --> 49:16.600
Oh yeah, you're in peak physical condition.

49:16.600 --> 49:18.600
So then I'm going to do shit that has nothing to do with being black.

49:18.600 --> 49:20.600
I just want to be ripped.

49:20.600 --> 49:22.600
Well then, you can just go to the gym, dude.

49:22.600 --> 49:24.600
No, that's the whole point.

49:24.600 --> 49:26.600
You don't have to go to the gym, dude.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.600
That's what you don't have to do.

49:28.600 --> 49:30.600
You don't have to be black to be in good shape.

49:30.600 --> 49:32.600
Or to fuck your girlfriend properly.

49:32.600 --> 49:34.600
Fuck your girlfriend properly.

49:40.600 --> 49:42.600
Fine.

49:42.600 --> 49:44.600
Fine.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.600
Let's hear from Gibran, everybody. Gibran.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.600
Thank you.

49:48.600 --> 49:50.600
Thank you, Gibran.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.600
Can I just make a shout out?

49:52.600 --> 49:54.600
Sure, sure.

49:54.600 --> 49:56.600
Happy birthday to my cousin Ivan

49:56.600 --> 49:58.600
and eat your heart out, Les Wong.

49:58.600 --> 50:00.600
Thank you.

50:00.600 --> 50:02.600
Gibran.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.600
Canadians.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.600
Dan, I have to say,

50:08.600 --> 50:10.600
that was a hell of an interview.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.600
You really are bad at it.

50:22.600 --> 50:24.600
You don't know other people exist.

50:26.600 --> 50:28.600
That guy sat on stage here

50:28.600 --> 50:30.600
with a microphone in his hand, never spoken to it.

50:30.600 --> 50:32.600
And you simply didn't care at all.

50:32.600 --> 50:34.600
Yeah, but he was like, you know,

50:34.600 --> 50:36.600
he was like, oh, I want to come up here.

50:36.600 --> 50:38.600
I mean, how do you know he deserves it?

50:40.600 --> 50:42.600
Maybe that was bad.

50:42.600 --> 50:44.600
Karma. But he said he was solipsistic

50:44.600 --> 50:46.600
and so are you in that way.

50:46.600 --> 50:48.600
He did good. He did fine.

50:48.600 --> 50:50.600
He got everything he was going to get.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.600
Gibran from Canada.

50:54.600 --> 50:56.600
He got, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:56.600 --> 50:58.600
Who is he going to get?

50:58.600 --> 51:00.600
Who is he going to carry him out on our shoulders?

51:00.600 --> 51:02.600
No, we wanted to find out

51:02.600 --> 51:04.600
if you could actually invest

51:04.600 --> 51:06.600
interest in another human being.

51:06.600 --> 51:08.600
All right, all right, what's your name?

51:08.600 --> 51:10.600
Anatoly.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.600
Anatoly?

51:12.600 --> 51:14.600
Anatoly, get on stage, Anatoly.

51:18.600 --> 51:20.600
All right, Anatoly, that sounds like

51:20.600 --> 51:22.600
an exotic name.

51:22.600 --> 51:24.600
The names are getting weirder.

51:24.600 --> 51:26.600
Anatoly, where are you from?

51:26.600 --> 51:28.600
From Russia.

51:28.600 --> 51:30.600
Oh, shit.

51:30.600 --> 51:32.600
All right.

51:32.600 --> 51:34.600
All right.

51:34.600 --> 51:36.600
So you're just visiting?

51:36.600 --> 51:38.600
No, I studied here.

51:38.600 --> 51:40.600
Oh, you studied? Where at what school?

51:40.600 --> 51:42.600
In UCLA.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.600
It's part of an exchange program?

51:44.600 --> 51:46.600
No, no, no.

51:46.600 --> 51:48.600
Just came here to study.

51:48.600 --> 51:50.600
So I did directing.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.600
You started directing?

51:52.600 --> 51:54.600
Film, TV?

51:54.600 --> 51:56.600
So were you directing in Russia?

51:56.600 --> 51:58.600
No.

51:58.600 --> 52:00.600
I just came to study.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.600
He came over and said, I think I'll try directing.

52:02.600 --> 52:04.600
Yeah.

52:04.600 --> 52:06.600
Well, I mean, it's just, you know, a lot of us,

52:06.600 --> 52:08.600
a lot of directors in this audience

52:08.600 --> 52:10.600
are out of work right now.

52:10.600 --> 52:12.600
So I'm sorry, but fuck you guys.

52:14.600 --> 52:16.600
All right, wow.

52:16.600 --> 52:18.600
As a Russian at some point,

52:18.600 --> 52:22.600
he must break you.

52:22.600 --> 52:24.600
So how old are you?

52:24.600 --> 52:26.600
I'm 23.

52:26.600 --> 52:28.600
23?

52:28.600 --> 52:30.600
Man, just your life pulsing

52:30.600 --> 52:32.600
through your little sinewy Russian veins.

52:34.600 --> 52:36.600
Do they have black people in Russia?

52:36.600 --> 52:38.600
Really few.

52:38.600 --> 52:40.600
Yeah.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.600
In my town, I think black people.

52:42.600 --> 52:44.600
So how...

52:44.600 --> 52:48.600
What were their names?

52:48.600 --> 52:50.600
And we're going to check.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.600
If one's Jabran, we're going to smell a rat.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.600
Were your parents rich?

53:02.600 --> 53:04.600
Would you call them rich?

53:04.600 --> 53:06.600
Middle class, lower class.

53:06.600 --> 53:08.600
Yeah.

53:08.600 --> 53:10.600
So how do you get hooked up?

53:10.600 --> 53:12.600
I don't understand.

53:12.600 --> 53:14.600
Do you have a process that gets you

53:14.600 --> 53:16.600
to come over here to UCLA

53:16.600 --> 53:18.600
to study directing?

53:18.600 --> 53:20.600
Just...

53:20.600 --> 53:22.600
For those of us listening to Russia right now,

53:22.600 --> 53:24.600
it's called Airlines.

53:24.600 --> 53:26.600
Yeah, yeah.

53:26.600 --> 53:28.600
Actually, I can start from far along

53:28.600 --> 53:30.600
when I was born,

53:30.600 --> 53:32.600
but I don't know.

53:32.600 --> 53:34.600
I like movies.

53:34.600 --> 53:36.600
I like TV shows.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.600
I think I watch a couple of sort of community.

53:38.600 --> 53:40.600
Oh, yeah?

53:40.600 --> 53:42.600
You saw a couple of episodes?

53:42.600 --> 53:44.600
I like...

53:44.600 --> 53:46.600
I think it was a episode about

53:46.600 --> 53:48.600
Inspector Space Time Convention.

53:48.600 --> 53:50.600
I think it was the best episode.

53:50.600 --> 53:52.600
I like your job.

53:52.600 --> 53:54.600
But that was fourth season.

53:54.600 --> 53:56.600
You said...

53:56.600 --> 53:58.600
It's alright.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.600
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

54:00.600 --> 54:02.600
He can't tell.

54:06.600 --> 54:08.600
So you just...

54:08.600 --> 54:10.600
This is the world we live in now.

54:10.600 --> 54:12.600
You're just sitting in Russia and you go,

54:12.600 --> 54:14.600
I want a direct TV and you just

54:14.600 --> 54:16.600
up and came over on a plane.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.600
Nobody grabbed you at the border and was like,

54:18.600 --> 54:20.600
What are you doing? What are you trying to do?

54:20.600 --> 54:22.600
Get out of here!

54:22.600 --> 54:24.600
You have to get a student visa.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.600
Oh, a student visa.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.600
How long do those last?

54:28.600 --> 54:30.600
Four years?

54:30.600 --> 54:32.600
No, it's value study.

54:32.600 --> 54:34.600
You can study almost all your life.

54:34.600 --> 54:36.600
So it doesn't matter.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.600
I don't know that much yet.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.600
Do you have friends over here?

54:40.600 --> 54:42.600
Not really many, but

54:42.600 --> 54:44.600
a few people.

54:44.600 --> 54:46.600
Are you in a dorm room at UCLA?

54:46.600 --> 54:48.600
No, I just rent in a room.

54:48.600 --> 54:50.600
In Echo Park.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.600
Oh, really? Just a one bedroom apartment?

54:52.600 --> 54:54.600
No, it's a three bedroom.

54:54.600 --> 54:56.600
So how did you find the roommates?

54:56.600 --> 54:58.600
I'm Craigslist.

54:58.600 --> 55:00.600
Craigslist?

55:00.600 --> 55:02.600
Yeah.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.600
So what do you want to make?

55:04.600 --> 55:06.600
I'm sorry, I hate to interrupt.

55:06.600 --> 55:08.600
Jump in, I'm so fucking tired.

55:08.600 --> 55:10.600
No.

55:10.600 --> 55:12.600
I thought I did a good job.

55:12.600 --> 55:14.600
I instinctively jumped in as

55:14.600 --> 55:16.600
I saw you flagging over there.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.600
You held your cup very close to your lips

55:18.600 --> 55:20.600
and you wanted a sip.

55:20.600 --> 55:22.600
But you were doing a really good interview there.

55:22.600 --> 55:24.600
He's so Russian.

55:24.600 --> 55:26.600
What part of Russia are you from?

55:26.600 --> 55:28.600
It's middle of Russia.

55:28.600 --> 55:30.600
It's town called Orenburg.

55:30.600 --> 55:32.600
And no one heard about it.

55:32.600 --> 55:34.600
No one heard about it.

55:34.600 --> 55:36.600
You thought one guy would go,

55:36.600 --> 55:38.600
Woo!

55:38.600 --> 55:40.600
But I think of like,

55:40.600 --> 55:42.600
as a Russian student coming over here to direct,

55:42.600 --> 55:44.600
are you a big fan of Russian film?

55:44.600 --> 55:46.600
Or are you a film student?

55:46.600 --> 55:48.600
Or are you more of a TV fan?

55:48.600 --> 55:50.600
I don't know.

55:50.600 --> 55:52.600
Do you love this directors that love

55:52.600 --> 55:54.600
their foreign film,

55:54.600 --> 55:56.600
love their classical films?

55:56.600 --> 55:58.600
You're a big scholar of filmmakers.

55:58.600 --> 56:00.600
Are you more just like,

56:00.600 --> 56:02.600
what do you want to make?

56:02.600 --> 56:04.600
That's great.

56:04.600 --> 56:06.600
I don't really like,

56:06.600 --> 56:08.600
I like some Russian,

56:08.600 --> 56:10.600
like old films.

56:10.600 --> 56:12.600
But now it's like really

56:12.600 --> 56:14.600
terrible business in Russia.

56:14.600 --> 56:16.600
Like every,

56:16.600 --> 56:18.600
like only one movie out of like 100

56:18.600 --> 56:20.600
was to watch it.

56:20.600 --> 56:22.600
So it's nothing to do in there.

56:22.600 --> 56:24.600
Who do you think is interviewing you better right now?

56:24.600 --> 56:26.600
Me or Jeff?

56:26.600 --> 56:28.600
Like I found,

56:28.600 --> 56:30.600
I feel like his interview is more like,

56:30.600 --> 56:32.600
it's like more boring.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.600
Like mine's more personal.

56:36.600 --> 56:38.600
And I tell you, who's the most passive aggressive

56:38.600 --> 56:40.600
interviewer right now?

56:42.600 --> 56:44.600
But if you had your dream job,

56:44.600 --> 56:46.600
if you could make whatever you wanted,

56:46.600 --> 56:48.600
what kind of show,

56:48.600 --> 56:50.600
what would you make as a director?

56:50.600 --> 56:52.600
Yeah.

56:54.600 --> 56:56.600
Do you want to do TV or movies?

56:56.600 --> 56:58.600
Oh, for sure TV.

56:58.600 --> 57:00.600
Really? For sure TV?

57:00.600 --> 57:02.600
Because it's like if you're directing TV,

57:02.600 --> 57:04.600
you have like two weeks of work

57:04.600 --> 57:06.600
and get money and buy.

57:08.600 --> 57:10.600
And you don't have to sit and like

57:10.600 --> 57:12.600
develop for five years and

57:12.600 --> 57:14.600
without money.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.600
What's your favorite American TV show?

57:16.600 --> 57:18.600
Not your favorite, but just a random one.

57:18.600 --> 57:20.600
Madman.

57:20.600 --> 57:22.600
Madman.

57:22.600 --> 57:24.600
Yeah.

57:26.600 --> 57:28.600
Would you want to direct like,

57:28.600 --> 57:30.600
you want to direct hour stuff like that?

57:30.600 --> 57:32.600
Is that what you would want to do?

57:34.600 --> 57:36.600
You are starting directing right?

57:36.600 --> 57:38.600
Yeah.

57:38.600 --> 57:40.600
Alright wait, can you, okay, Jeff and I are going to do a scene

57:40.600 --> 57:42.600
and you're going to direct it.

57:42.600 --> 57:44.600
Yeah.

57:46.600 --> 57:48.600
We're going to do it from Madman.

57:48.600 --> 57:50.600
We're going to try, well, it'll be like

57:50.600 --> 57:52.600
from Madman, like not a real scene,

57:52.600 --> 57:54.600
but and then you will do

57:54.600 --> 57:56.600
one take and then you adjust us.

57:56.600 --> 57:58.600
You say cut and then you adjust us

57:58.600 --> 58:00.600
and then we'll do another take.

58:00.600 --> 58:02.600
Okay, so I'm Don Draper.

58:02.600 --> 58:04.600
I've never seen it, so I'll be Al Sharp.

58:04.600 --> 58:06.600
Al Sharp?

58:08.600 --> 58:10.600
Alright, I'm Don Draper.

58:10.600 --> 58:12.600
I'm Al Sharp.

58:12.600 --> 58:14.600
I'm a new intern named Al Sharp.

58:14.600 --> 58:16.600
Okay.

58:16.600 --> 58:18.600
Oh, Mr. Draper.

58:18.600 --> 58:20.600
I didn't realize you were going to be in this early.

58:20.600 --> 58:22.600
Al, I'm always going to be in this early

58:22.600 --> 58:24.600
when the Heinz account gets this fucked up.

58:24.600 --> 58:26.600
I'm sorry.

58:26.600 --> 58:28.600
I was here earlier and I saw that somebody

58:28.600 --> 58:30.600
has spilled coffee all over the Heinz account.

58:30.600 --> 58:32.600
It's not your job to worry about coffee spelling.

58:32.600 --> 58:34.600
It's your job to be a madman.

58:34.600 --> 58:36.600
Alright.

58:38.600 --> 58:40.600
Anatoly?

58:40.600 --> 58:42.600
Give us notes.

58:42.600 --> 58:44.600
So adjust us.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.600
What can we do better in that scene?

58:48.600 --> 58:50.600
Okay, first of all,

58:50.600 --> 58:52.600
you need to change your clothes.

58:52.600 --> 58:54.600
Okay.

58:54.600 --> 58:56.600
He was talking to Dan.

58:56.600 --> 58:58.600
He was talking to Dan.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.600
I think you'll find that I'm properly dressed

59:00.600 --> 59:02.600
for a Madman scene.

59:02.600 --> 59:04.600
I can't, I mean, I'll...

59:04.600 --> 59:06.600
Okay.

59:06.600 --> 59:08.600
Describe what you would have him wear.

59:08.600 --> 59:10.600
What should he be wearing right now?

59:10.600 --> 59:12.600
Something like...

59:12.600 --> 59:14.600
Something like I'm wearing, yes.

59:14.600 --> 59:16.600
So should everybody, Anatoly.

59:16.600 --> 59:18.600
Thank you.

59:18.600 --> 59:20.600
Alright.

59:20.600 --> 59:22.600
I like this guy. He's a good director.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.600
So far, he's a great wardrobe supervisor.

59:24.600 --> 59:26.600
I don't know.

59:28.600 --> 59:30.600
If someone here has a TV show,

59:30.600 --> 59:32.600
if he wants to hire me,

59:32.600 --> 59:34.600
I don't know.

59:34.600 --> 59:36.600
I feel like I just got insulted,

59:36.600 --> 59:38.600
but I can't tell.

59:38.600 --> 59:40.600
I didn't hear what you said. Say again.

59:40.600 --> 59:42.600
I think maybe someone

59:42.600 --> 59:44.600
might hire me to make a TV show,

59:44.600 --> 59:46.600
like if he had fun.

59:46.600 --> 59:48.600
You should get a TV show,

59:48.600 --> 59:50.600
I think you should.

59:50.600 --> 59:52.600
They should give Dan Harmon a TV show.

59:52.600 --> 59:54.600
The audience should hire him to direct a TV show.

59:54.600 --> 59:56.600
Yeah.

59:56.600 --> 59:58.600
But now you have to give us direction

59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.600
so we can't just be wardrobe.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.600
I think first of all,

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.600
the scene

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.600
must be

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.600
written really.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.600
It...

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.600
You need a script.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.600
You're a producer.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.600
So better written.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.600
We'll do it again, but better written.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.600
He needs a better script

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.600
and the people need to be dressed better.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.600
This is confirming a lot of theories I've had

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:28.600
about this.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.600
I've had a

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.600
sneaking suspicion

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.600
that I know what goes on

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.600
when I'm not around.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.600
But...

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.600
Do you want to try it again?

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.600
Better written?

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.600
Okay, better written.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.600
You're in a skinny mod suit

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.600
and the scene is better written.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.600
I'm impeccably dressed.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.600
What was your name?

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.600
I'm Al Sharpton.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.600
I'm a young intern.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.600
Okay.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.600
Draper.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.600
You'd be better off saying winter

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.600
because a cold wind is going to blow up your asshole.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.600
I got the Heinz account right here on the floor

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.600
but 57 reasons to fuck you in the ass.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.600
Then pour it over every fry

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.600
because it's 1968

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.600
and Vietnam!

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.600
Motherfucker!

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.600
Anatoly, everybody.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.600
Thank you so much.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.600
Nice, good director.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.600
Anatoly, you did good.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.600
That is good directing.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.600
Anatoly.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.600
You saw him here first.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.600
He's the new Spielberg.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.600
Alright, let's get Spencer up here.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.600
Let's play some more Spencer.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.600
Spencer!

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.600
Get your satchel.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.600
Hello, Spencer Crittenden.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.600
How are you, sir?

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.600
Hey, hey, hey.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.600
Hey.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.600
Any new fun stories about being my assistant?

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.600
Okay, so one of the writer's rooms

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.600
is like, there's a long table in.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.600
There's a room for about like

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.600
five or six seats on either side.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.600
And it's just full of clutter.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.600
And this one time, Dan was all like,

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.600
Spencer, give me a five-hour energy.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.600
And I was like, I already have one.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.600
And I pulled one out of my auxiliary pocket

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.600
because that's where I keep it.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.600
And I was on the other side of this long table

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.600
and I slid it all the way down the table

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.600
and it got like right to him

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.600
and he caught it and everyone was like,

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.600
ooh.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.600
Yeah, there's not a lot.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.600
I mean, everything Spencer does, though,

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.600
has that air of mystery to it.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.600
Spencer came in.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.600
I told him to go get me a sweatshirt out of my car.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.600
And then he came in at one point where

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.600
he was like, it's season five,

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.600
so everyone's very quiet.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.600
A bunch of very smart, funny writers

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.600
in there.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.600
And I don't think I'd have it any other way, I guess.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.600
We hired a bunch of people who are like

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.600
very enamored with community.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.600
We've got a bunch of geniuses in there

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.600
who are brilliant scripts.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.600
But the upshot is it feels like teaching a Harvard law class.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.600
Like that writer's room.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.600
It's just like a bunch of young, smart, funny people

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.600
that are sitting there.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.600
They don't physically raise their hands before they speak,

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.600
isn't there one of the writers here tonight?

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.600
Isn't it Alex here?

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.600
Alex, are you here?

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.600
Will you come up here for a second?

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.600
This could be at his peril.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.600
I don't know.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.600
I mean, yeah, just grab a mic

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.600
for a second.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600
I heard you were here in the writer's room.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.600
Is it Canon Films T-shirt?

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.600
Canon Films?

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.600
Oh, no, it's OCP.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.600
So what's it like working for me?

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.600
It's great.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.600
I mean...

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.600
But it's quiet in that room, right?

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.600
Yeah, you described it well.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.600
I mean, the genius part was nice.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.600
People aren't quiet because I'm a bad person, right?

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.600
No, no, no. Well, I can speak only for myself.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.600
I mean, I think, you know, we're all awkward people.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.600
Because I'm amazing.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.600
It involves you,

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.600
but not in a...

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.600
It mourns the amazing way

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.600
than in the...

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.600
Like, you're going like, oh, God, Dan's

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.600
talking like about

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.600
what should happen in this episode.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.600
Why would we ever want to say anything else?

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.600
Yeah, I mean, I feel like

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.600
I'm on one half of a bit that's going on right now.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.600
And I...

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.600
I just got a little insecure.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.600
Like, I choose...

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.600
I have blind design. I go like, okay, well,

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.600
I hired everybody, and they're all very quiet.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.600
So I'm going to make the conscious

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.600
decision that everybody's being really

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.600
quiet because I'm amazing.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.600
But then there's a little voice in the back

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.600
of my head that goes, you're embarrassing yourself.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.600
Well, I'm

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.600
stuck in my own head sort of the way

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.600
you are in your head. So I know that if I

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.600
say yes, then I'm going to feel like I'm kissing

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.600
your ass because you're my boss. Right.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.600
All the other writers are listening and they go, oh, Alex

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.600
was on Harbit Channel. Speaking for myself,

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.600
I'm very excited about this job,

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.600
and I don't want to fuck it up.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.600
So if I'm going to speak up,

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.600
I want to...

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.600
I care how it lands.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.600
Right. Well, you're doing great, but let's just run down

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.600
the other writers.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.600
So...

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.600
What do you think? Ryan Ridley, like...

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.600
Right?

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.600
Clearly only got hired because he's a friend of mine.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.600
Ryan took a lot of abuse

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.600
the first week or so.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.600
All right.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.600
Thank you.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.600
I don't know what you could possibly do.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.600
If there's anything you want to plug,

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.600
Alex Rubin's...

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.600
Rubin Town. Yeah.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.600
Community Season 5, starting now.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.600
Community Season 5, see you at Comic-Con.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.600
All right, Alex Rubins.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.600
See what I'm going through?

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.600
See what I'm going through?

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.600
Did you see his pants, his shorts?

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.600
Those were awesome.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.600
I want those shorts.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.600
No, what...

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:32.600
I like Alex. I think he's a great writer.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.600
He seems like a good guy.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.600
Of course he's a great writer.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.600
I read his script. What are you going through?

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.600
Going through being in a room with 14 people

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.600
whose scripts I've read are all great writers,

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.600
and they're just like...

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.600
I'm kind of going like, okay, so if Troy

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.600
has allergic to cheese, then what if Abbot said this,

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.600
and he's kind of like...

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.600
Very quiet.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.600
Yeah, I want to talk a lot,

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.600
but that's not my job, obviously,

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.600
but I feel like, Jesus Christ,

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.600
these are silences there.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.600
These are pregnant pauses.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.600
It's not just me.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.600
He gets awkward.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.600
I think one time I clocked in

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.600
about three minutes of silence.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.600
But in your opinion,

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.600
as a 12-year-old, however old you are,

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.600
should I regress

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.600
for this question?

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.600
It's not because I'm untalented, right?

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.600
It's because I'm super talented, right?

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.600
I don't know what it is.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.600
Lie to me! Lie to me!

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.600
It's because I intimidate everyone.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.600
We love you, Dan.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.600
It's because, you know, just...

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.600
Your intellect is very tangible.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.600
You know?

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.600
And they feel it.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.600
Spencer, if I play the music,

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.600
will you give us your internal monologue

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.600
during one of the community writing silences?

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.600
Yeah.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.600
Nobody's talking.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.600
Still, nobody's talking.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.600
My mind reels

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.600
with possibilities of things

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:04.600
that could be said.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.600
Good ideas, bad ideas,

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.600
they all bubble up, but, uh,

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.600
why isn't anybody fucking talking?

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.600
I'll say you write a TV show.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.600
I think it's because they all have 200 IQs.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.600
I think they're all...

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.600
They're all Onion and Harvard...

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.600
Yeah, well, it's like he was saying,

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.600
it's like you're all up in your head

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.600
and you're like, these guys are staring at me

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.600
like I'm brilliant or an asshole,

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.600
and there he's in his head, and he's like,

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.600
man, this guy's looking at me like I'm either about

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.600
to say something genius or a big asshole,

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.600
and, like, all the other writers are like,

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.600
aw, man, he just said something good.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.600
I look like an asshole.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.600
And that's probably what everyone's thinking about

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.600
this whole time, just assholes.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.600
That's true.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.600
But in the meantime, 13 episodes

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.600
of the greatest television show in history,

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.600
Hanging the Lurch.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.600
They didn't hang in there, tell them that.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.600
So the heroes, heroes are going to rise

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.600
and fall, like, well, this is the fricking...

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.600
I'll do it myself for sure.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.600
You think I should get hardcore?

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.600
Two and a half minutes into one of these

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.600
three-minute silences, just go crazy.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.600
Just go, wow, what am I doing here?

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.600
Exactly.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.600
But then they'll be like, what do you mean?

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.600
You hired me.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.600
And then they'll be like, I'm sorry.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.600
You should get Anatoly to come in

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.600
and direct how to run a writer.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.600
You should dress different.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.600
That's what we're teaching Russia,

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.600
by the way.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.600
And I'm not surprised they're getting

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.600
that message.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.600
It's empty stylistic masturbation.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.600
It's like, come on.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.600
You like Breaking Bad, though, right, Anatoly?

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.600
Actually, I didn't.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.600
I didn't, so I see it.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.600
Well, they dress very well in that show.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.600
Oh, boy.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.600
The whole planet is just going to

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.600
collapse like a balloon,

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.600
culturally.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.600
We did it. America won.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.600
This is our punishment.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.600
We didn't ever do what we were doing.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.600
The only thing we ever did was go,

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.600
America's great!

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.600
And now that's the culture?

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.600
It's just like,

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.600
no, it's done.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.600
Those are the only good shows

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.600
about people shooting up

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.600
and dying.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.600
We're celebrating our death.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.600
But your show doesn't really fit into that, does it?

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.600
No, it doesn't, Jeff.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.600
I mean, that sincerely.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.600
You're intentionally not playing

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.600
ball with that paradigm.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.600
There's a lot of pressure, isn't it?

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.600
It's a lot of pressure.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.600
Right, Alex?

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.600
Yes, okay.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.600
Dan, I want to play the Spencer music,

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.600
but you're going to do Dr. Master Voice

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.600
when you're helming the writer's room.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.600
Last season wasn't very good.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.600
But you found out

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.600
you're not allowed to say that anymore.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.600
Seizing the power

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.600
of the high road,

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.600
you took it all the way

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.600
to having permission to do whatever you want.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.600
But what will you do?

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.600
Having had the right

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.600
to do muppets

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.600
and animation removed from you

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.600
creatively.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.600
You sought

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.600
to figure out

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.600
how you could possibly deliver

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.600
a quality show

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.600
under a historically low budget.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.600
While an insidious

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.600
old studio looms above you

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.600
hating everything you do,

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.600
demanding that you pitch it to them

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.600
but not having a right to say no

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.600
to anything.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.600
Meanwhile, in the bowels underneath you,

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.600
16-year-old girls

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.600
wait patiently with their Tumblr blogs.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.600
You can either let them down

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.600
or let them down.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.600
In any case,

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.600
your show will possibly air

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.600
if it ever does air

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.600
in the worst time slot, on the worst network,

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.600
in the worst time for television

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.600
in television history.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.600
Parks and Rec may

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.600
be

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.600
your lead-in.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.600
I tried to time it, right?

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.600
Right, right.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.600
Let's get Erin out here

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.600
and play some D&D.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.600
Erin the Gappy to the stage.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.600
You can't wait for the Variety headlines, huh?

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.600
You love your famous boyfriend.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.600
I do love my famous boyfriend.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.600
I love those Michael Ossiello headlines.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.600
Full disclosure,

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.600
I'm still a little drunk from that neighborhood

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.600
party.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.600
With the tumor lady?

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.600
That was crazy.

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.600
Well, I mean, it certainly was not crazy.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.600
But it was a party, and I drank a lot

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.600
to get along with people.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.600
I want to hang out with her more.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.600
I find myself now, I think it's a 30

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.600
versus 40 thing.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.600
Between 30 and 40,

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.600
mortality becomes

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.600
breaking bad.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.600
I just find myself now.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.600
You're waiting for it to come?

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.600
You see somebody whose foot

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.600
has been chopped off

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.600
by a boat propeller,

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.600
and you're just like,

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.600
tell me more about that,

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.600
because you start preparing yourself

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.600
for,

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.600
whereas before that, from 29

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.600
to 30, you're just like,

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.600
I don't want to,

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.600
that's not good.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.600
I don't want to go down that rabbit hole.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.600
I think maybe it's because

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.600
I'm 40, I'm just like, hey,

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.600
you almost died.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.600
Do you have a t-shirt?

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.600
I don't want to argue with you,

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.600
but I think that's a human thing.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.600
We were in two different conversations,

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.600
but I think that's interesting.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.600
What was yours about?

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.600
My conversation at the party

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.600
was cool.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.600
I was making jokes about drinking red wine,

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.600
and a woman asked me what I was doing,

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.600
and I told her very honestly like,

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.600
I don't know, I paint my drink,

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.600
and I do whatever, and I'm worried

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.600
about myself, and she's like, I'm a casting director,

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.600
and you've auditioned for me, and I was like, cool, cool, cool.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.600
Great, great.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.600
You never know what's going to happen

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.600
on the patio next to Dan Harmon's house.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.600
But it was a great party.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.600
It was the most fun I've ever had.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.600
What did you drink?

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.600
What did I drink?

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.600
Something from Paseo Robles.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.600
Paseo Robles?

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.600
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.600
Yeah, a grape.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.600
It was something made from grapes, and it was red.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.600
Vodka. Wine.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.600
Wine. It was wine.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.600
I poured it in a glass that looked,

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.600
I mean, the top was white,

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.600
and then it went down to a thing.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.600
Thank you, wine glass.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.600
Yeah, and I had several of those.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.600
Are you okay?

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.600
No, I don't think so.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.600
Are you going to puke?

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.600
No, I don't think I'm going to puke.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.600
Let's play D&D.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.600
All right.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.600
Last town on Harmon.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.600
Town.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.600
Our heroes had just

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.600
felled a bearded demon

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.600
during the fight.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.600
Mulraines slew

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.600
slab squat thrust.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.600
This threw the group into a tense

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.600
moral dilemma regarding the value

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.600
of life.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.600
Not really.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.600
Sharpie didn't really care, so the gang

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.600
moved past him. After hacking a group

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.600
of entangled lemurs to death,

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.600
they discovered Sharpie's father,

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.600
Mango Buttsalot, buried

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.600
up to his neck at the bottom

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.600
of a large pit.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.600
Mango Buttsalot told the heroes

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.600
of Dark Star's assault on the world,

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.600
how he destroyed mountains

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.600
and pillaged cities, and was

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.600
enslaving people to power

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.600
strange, eldritch engines of doom.

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.600
Mango asked Sharpie to head towards

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.600
Dark Star's Black Keep far to the north

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.600
to put a stop to his evil plans.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.600
To aid the party, Mango also set

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.600
Yerch, a dubious move

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.600
that seemed like somewhat of a half-hearted gesture

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.600
given the circumstances.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.600
And with some last-minute advice, Mango

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.600
sent the adventurers off to the north.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.600
Yerch suggested that the party

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.600
stop in either Thornvale or

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.600
Thornheim, the frozen city,

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.600
in order to seek aid from their military,

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.600
as the fortress was known

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.600
for its outstanding defensive and

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.600
offensive capabilities.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.600
So onward, they marched to Thornheim

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.600
and then to the Black Keep

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.600
to stop Dark Star's reign.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.600
Spencer.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.600
Alright, so we're on our way to

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.600
Thornfield.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.600
Thornheim. Thornheim?

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.600
I knew it was a Jewish name.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.600
Alright, and we're

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.600
going to encounter random encounters

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.600
on the way, not that I'm metagaming.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.600
As the days and miles pass,

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.600
the vegetation grows sparse,

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.600
the sky colder and darker,

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.600
rolling hills turn

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.600
into high mountains and winding passes,

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.600
wind through treacherous trails.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.600
As you trudge up the mountains,

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.600
you round a bend and catch sight of it.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.600
A dazzling crystalline fortress

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.600
of blue and white sparkling in the

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.600
cold winter sun.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.600
Thornheim, the frozen city,

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.600
but lying between you and the city gate

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.600
is a massive white bridge,

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.600
entirely composed of ice.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.600
The slick white ice bridge looks

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.600
treacherous, glistening and shimmering,

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.600
stretching across a great white void

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.600
of howling, screaming wind.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.600
Quirk. Yes?

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.600
I can't remember why we came here.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.600
Because

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.600
Mango told us to go to the Black Heap

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.600
and this is the way to get there, I think.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.600
And also,

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.600
that's all I remember.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.600
But I have the

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.600
the armlet of winter,

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.600
and we're going to cross an ice bridge.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.600
Maybe I can reinforce this by calling forth

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.600
my power of winter to reinforce

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.600
this rickety city bridge. No, you'll be popular here

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.600
for a change, that'll be great.

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:18.600
Whoa! Whoa!

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.600
What the fuck? Sorry.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.600
That's weird, because I was just

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.600
we were, everything was cool until just now.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.600
I just, sometimes,

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.600
are you saying I'm not popular wherever we go?

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.600
No, I'm saying you are.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.600
Well, you said it pretty sarcastically.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.600
Well, I, sarcastically.

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.600
You're very popular. Thank you, Mulraine.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.600
What the fuck is up with this dick?

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.600
Everywhere we go,

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.600
you get the right armlet for something.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.600
It's called armlet, first of all.

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:50.600
You call it armlet,

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.600
I got dumb dumb.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.600
Can we not fight

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.600
and can we have a password? I was totally cool

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.600
and I was going to reinforce the

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.600
ice bridge and we could all go in there like friends

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.600
but you were being like a weirdo.

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.600
Is the ice bridge broken? No, he said it was rickety.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.600
I mean, I can see

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.600
non-metagamically

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.600
looking ahead of me that this

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.600
ice bridge looks like it could use some reinforcing.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.600
Spencer, do I have power

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.600
of make the other people in my party

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.600
kiss so we can let go of some tension?

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.600
There's diplomacy.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.600
Yeah, they fucked in a tree.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.600
They fucked in a tree?

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.600
I think so, yeah.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.600
It depends on your definition.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.600
Wait, what?

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.600
You guys fucked in a tree?

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.600
Look, if you're not going to show up for every episode,

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.600
then...

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:38.600
On purpose?

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.600
You don't fuck

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.600
accidentally up a tree.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.600
Fine, fine.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.600
You're just fucking in a tree.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.600
Well, knowing that, maybe you guys

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.600
should just fuck now

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.600
and we can move on.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.600
That's not metagaming.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.600
That's not metagaming.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.600
Mulrainee is pro fucking.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.600
I walk up to the edge of the bridge

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.600
and sick out one toe to test its stability.

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.600
This bridge is rather thick.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.600
It's maybe

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.600
five or six feet thick

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.600
and it's quite a ways.

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.600
I saunter past his checking.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.600
300 feet.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.600
It seems sturdy as he saunters out.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.600
I'm just walking.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.600
See you at the other side,

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.600
my good ex-friend.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.600
I spit on my stomach and I slide across.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.600
Oh, no, no, wait, I dry my stomach.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.600
Yeah, that would make...

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.600
Wait, halfway through sliding, you dry your stomach?

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.600
I'm realizing if I spit on my stomach,

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.600
I'll be at the front of it.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.600
Yeah, it'll make you stick.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.600
My spit will...

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.600
I blow my stomach and then I slide across.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.600
Oh, okay, you get like

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:00.600
five, seven feet.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.600
How far across is the bridge?

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:08.600
It's like 300 feet.

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.600
I giggle like I was doing a joke

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.600
and I stand up.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.600
I stay at my edge of the bridge

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.600
and I yell out to Sharpie.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.600
I say, hey, look, man, I don't know

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.600
what that was about back there, but look,

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.600
this bridge might not hold us all.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.600
Get to the other side and then I'll come after you.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.600
All right, I'm sorry too

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.600
about what happened.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.600
Yeah, I was out of the fucking left field, dude.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.600
I've been drinking.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.600
Fuck.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:36.600
Oh, in the game?

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.600
What game are you talking about?

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.600
Spencer? Experience points.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.600
That's not fair.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.600
He's not allowed to do that.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.600
I'm allowed to stay in the game

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.600
and immerse myself in my...

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.600
You guys didn't actually fucking a tree, right?

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.600
Like in real life?

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.600
I scan the horizon for trees.

01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:58.600
Are there trees? There's no trees.

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:00.600
There's kind of like my own private Idaho

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:02.600
where there's just like still shots of us

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.600
doing different stuff.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.600
With my arm out of winter, I call down

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.600
a sleet in rain and it's snowstorm

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.600
to fashion an ice tree.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.600
Okay.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.600
Look, I just go like walking,

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.600
like crazy, like high stepping

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.600
and like stomping with every foot.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.600
No, that's definitely happening.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.600
Also, the sleet...

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.600
Yeah, so it's already

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.600
kind of snowy, but you're whipping it

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.600
up into a frenzy and it's getting

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.600
quite strong and treacherous

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.600
as if like maybe strong winds

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.600
might blow you off a slippery bridge.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:36.600
Okay, I stopped doing this.

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.600
Okay.

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.600
I was just testing out my ability to fashion

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.600
ice trees.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.600
That didn't go so well.

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.600
It didn't even happen.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.600
Look, like four warrants is four armed.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.600
Yeah.

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.600
Meanwhile...

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.600
It is what it is.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.600
You're stepping onto this bridge.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.600
Half the battle.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.600
The bottom line at the end of the test.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.600
Stop, drop and roll.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.600
You hear the sound of crunching

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.600
ice and snow and

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.600
coming out of the edges of this

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:10.600
bridge are these large

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.600
black poles. They're kind of extending

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.600
from the ground up into the air and they start

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.600
buzzing in a strange,

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.600
weird sound and you see kind of lines

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.600
and runes glow

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.600
light up on their surface.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:24.600
It makes a buzzing sound.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.600
So weird. Along the sides of the bridge?

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.600
Yeah, so it's as if like maybe railing

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.600
popped up but not the railing, just the posts.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.600
Gotcha. But they're big and they're

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.600
about ten feet tall and black.

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.600
And they're buzzing. And they're ominous.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.600
I don't like it. You don't.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.600
So I'm still not on the bridge.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.600
Mulraine's not on the bridge. Sharpie's out there on the bridge.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.600
You're right at the beginning of it.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.600
You're about halfway and you're seven feet.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.600
Sharpie has her knave. stuck to the bridge

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.600
seven feet across. Mulraine.

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.600
I mean Mulraine does, right?

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.600
I'm just an

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.600
asshole.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.600
I'm just lying there.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.600
These are posts

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.600
that are like buzzing

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:04.600
Yeah, they're like buzzing posts.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.600
I

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.600
keep moving forward trepidatiously.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.600
Alright, that happens.

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.600
Hesitantly.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.600
You don't feel impeded.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.600
Then I start bounding.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.600
Like a juvenile poppy.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.600
Alright.

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.600
Can I throw a rope

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.600
around Sharpie

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:26.600
and use him like a sled dog?

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.600
Wall lying down.

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:32.600
Sorry? Wall lying down.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.600
Well, maybe I get up a little bit.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.600
Okay, just enough to...

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.600
Mulraine, if you lie down, I'll get on you like a surfboard.

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.600
Oh, yay!

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.600
Yeah, get on me like a surfboard.

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.600
Have a cold.

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.600
Yeah, get on me like a surfboard.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.600
What do you mean, get on me like a surfboard?

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.600
You just tied your rope to him while you're laying in your stomach

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.600
and you wanted a sled across.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.600
Why not get on me like a sled?

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.600
Well, I'll stand facing forward

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.600
as opposed to sideways

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.600
like a surfboard.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.600
I thought I'd just...

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.600
Get on me any way you'd like.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.600
I thought we had a pact where we were going to play together.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.600
No, we do. I'm dealing with you guys

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.600
fucking in a tree. Are you guys together?

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.600
That was like back on the shadow plane.

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.600
I don't even remember that.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.600
It's like shadows of us fucking.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.600
That was pre-shadow plane.

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.600
In this party, we all fuck whatever we want.

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.600
It happened last week.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.600
It's totally fine.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.600
It's still like shadows of our...

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.600
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.600
It's all cool.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.600
This is the party.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.600
The rope, it doesn't go as far as you'd hope

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.600
and it doesn't land around its shoulders

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.600
or reach him.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.600
Okay.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.600
I don't know if you've never seen Footloose, right?

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.600
Like the side shot of Kevin Bacon,

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:50.600
like the dolly shot where he's just

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.600
bounding, like,

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.600
through the steel mill.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.600
It's like a Bob Vossy skip.

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.600
Every step is like another move.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.600
It's just bounding, bounding, bounding.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.600
You slip and fall.

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:06.600
Did you do a skip check?

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:08.600
I did. He failed it.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.600
Well, I get up and I continue doing it, though.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.600
Yeah.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.600
Your spirits can't be changed.

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:16.600
Using my fast barbarian movement,

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.600
I just run out and try to get as much ground

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.600
across the bridge as possible.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.600
I try to grab his ankle like a surfboard.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.600
All right. You grab his ankle

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.600
and are slid it onto the bridge.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.600
Being grabbed by your ankle,

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:32.600
you find it a bit hard to move.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.600
No shit.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.600
Even so,

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.600
you make your way onto the bridge

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.600
in the midst of these pleasant pillars.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.600
Well, it's just called crossing a bridge.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.600
Wrong.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.600
Crossing a bridge wrong.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.600
You hear a far-off

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:50.600
cling sound and then you hear

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.600
the sound of distant cannon fodder.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.600
I mean fire, not fodder.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.600
That doesn't sound like anything.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.600
It just sounds like people that are going to...

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.600
How far across the bridge are we?

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.600
You're about halfway.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.600
I keep running. Yeah, you do.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.600
I keep surfing.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.600
All right. What do you keep doing?

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.600
I'm just...

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.600
I actually do one roll.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.600
Like...

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.600
Like a combat roll.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.600
No, like a leap and a roll.

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.600
I call that a combat roll.

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.600
I just keep bounding.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.600
Oh. Yeah, okay.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.600
Okay.

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.600
As I'm traversing the bridge,

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.600
I'm just saying,

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.600
my locomotion

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:38.600
is fueled by a juvenile angst.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.600
Like I'm mad at my dad.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:42.600
I'm mad at...

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:44.600
I'm mad at having to re-catcher the rye.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.600
Like I don't know why I have to do anything,

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:48.600
except smoke and drink.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.600
I'm just going...

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:52.600
and I'm just bounding.

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.600
That comes off in your bounds.

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.600
Anyway, you see

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.600
three large dark shapes

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.600
hit the ground right in front of you.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.600
You're the farthest forward,

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:06.600
so you're the closest there about 10 feet off.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.600
Who is me?

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.600
No, Sharpie.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.600
Oh, he's bounding.

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:14.600
He's bounding.

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.600
Smoking and drinking.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.600
I'm holding you back.

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.600
I know.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:22.600
Yeah, but those things,

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.600
they hit the ground and you hear cracks

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.600
in the ice as ice cracks

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.600
start happening.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.600
I'm the closest to them, right?

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:32.600
You're the closest to them.

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.600
I hold my hands up and say,

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.600
Oh, hail dark cloak figures.

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:40.600
I am an emissary of peace

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.600
from my selfia.

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.600
Set figures are dark,

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.600
ogre-sized skeletons.

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:50.600
They wear heavy black fur cloaks

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.600
and charcoal-colored plate armor.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.600
Their eyes blaze with a cold blue fire.

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:56.600
You can hear the grinding sound

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.600
of metal gears turning.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.600
The grinding becomes a clattering

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.600
and then a silence.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.600
The skeletons drop into combat poses

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:06.600
as large, frozen swords materialize

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.600
in their hands, melding together

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.600
from ice and snow.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.600
Gentlemen, please.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.600
No need for that.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.600
Can we get over there somehow?

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.600
Maybe we do the same Sharpie

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.600
lunge.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.600
And I go,

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.600
Gentlemen, please.

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:30.600
And then I wreath

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.600
my arms in shocking grasp

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.600
electricity and I go,

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.600
No need for that.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:40.600
Alright, that happens.

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.600
As you're speaking,

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.600
two of them surround you.

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.600
They're on either side of you and the third

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.600
opens its mouth

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.600
and from within you can hear kind of a tinny voice

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.600
from deep inside go,

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.600
Time is the stronghold

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:56.600
of the strong.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.600
And then the two guys

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.600
flanking you lunge.

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:04.600
They strike you quicker than lightning

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.600
with their icy blades.

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.600
Gay.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:14.600
And by that I mean

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.600
equal.

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.600
Dealing

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.600
15 damage.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.600
Gay.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.600
Meaning empowered.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.600
Yeah.

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.600
Who's going to contain these people?

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:36.600
I run up behind

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.600
the recently wounded Sharpie

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.600
and I take out my armlet of winter

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.600
and do a sleep and snow attack

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:44.600
and then I try to blow them off the bridge.

01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:46.600
Yeah, okay.

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.600
So, activating your armlet

01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:50.600
you whip up the winds

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.600
and sleet in a frenzy.

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.600
Armlet. It's armlet.

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.600
Oh, sorry. I think armlet's clever.

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.600
It's cool. You're welcome.

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:00.600
It's like a bracelet on your arm.

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.600
Yeah, alright.

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:04.600
Well, I mean that's what an armlet is, right?

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.600
Well, is an amulet for your arm?

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're an armlet on here.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.600
I know, it is definitely an armlet.

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.600
You guys should do a podcast about jewelry.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.600
Armlet.

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.600
And with wintry powers

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.600
reething your body and surrounding you

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.600
you charge headlong

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.600
into one of the skeleton dudes.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.600
You miss

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.600
but your momentum carries you

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.600
skidding on the ice and you tackle

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.600
and clumsily, you know, knock into him

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:34.600
and the two of you are kind of sprawled out

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.600
on the floor in a heap.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.600
Cute. Yeah.

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:40.600
Can I attack again or am I now open to an attack?

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.600
It's now Mulraine's turn.

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.600
Alright, I run up and I

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.600
where everyone is standing now

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:48.600
is not on the bridge, right?

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.600
It's on the other side.

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:52.600
They're like three quarters of the way down the bridge.

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.600
Right now you're about a midway

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.600
down it so you're standing off a bit.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.600
You're okay.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.600
Well, I run up

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.600
to where everyone is. Okay.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.600
I create

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.600
flaming armor for a second.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.600
Yeah. I mean how powerful

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.600
is flaming armor?

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.600
It wreathes you with flames that don't

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.600
feel hot to you.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.600
But do they feel hot to an ice bridge

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.600
when they're all standing? I'm just wondering if I'm going to destroy the bridge.

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.600
Yeah.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.600
I mean, you don't know that.

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.600
You just know they're not hot to you.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.600
Maybe fire on an ice bridge.

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.600
Well, I mean, you know

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.600
that you could deactivate it if it starts

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.600
causing problems.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.600
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.600
Alright.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.600
I mean, can I slide past them?

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.600
Like

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.600
risky business?

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.600
Can I

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:46.600
risky biz slide past?

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.600
Yeah, maybe.

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.600
That's what Chopper's did in that movie.

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.600
He slid past enemies

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.600
called a fireplace.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.600
He just slid.

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.600
He slid past

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.600
his parents' rules.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.600
Like

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.600
Yeah, that happens. He slid past.

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.600
Oh, he slid past? Okay.

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:10.600
Well, if I've slid past, I create

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.600
flaming armor

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.600
that's on fire.

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:18.600
Sorry.

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:20.600
On a bridge made of ice.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.600
No, no, I slid past.

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:24.600
Oh, you're still on the bridge.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.600
You're still on the bridge.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.600
Alright.

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.600
I'll give them both eye contact this like look

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.600
like if it starts to go

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:34.600
bad.

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.600
I've got no problem. I mean, it's a bridge made of ice.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.600
It's not like, you know

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:40.600
I mean, what's below the bridge?

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.600
Probably heaven, right?

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.600
I'm sure there's a lot of ice infrastructure.

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:46.600
Okay.

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.600
Melting point of ice.

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.600
Somebody asked, what's the melting point of ice?

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:56.600
This pancake theory.

01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.600
Okay. Okay. This is what I do.

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.600
I put on the flaming armor, but I hop.

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.600
Okay.

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:04.600
I'm hopping. I'm constantly hopping.

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.600
So the fire's not really

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.600
making contact with the ice bridge too frequently.

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.600
So I'm just hopping along

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.600
and hopping and hopping. So it's really just

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.600
there's just a slickness. So it makes the bridge better.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.600
Yeah.

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.600
So you're on fire and hopping.

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:20.600
I'm on fire and hopping.

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:22.600
And what else? And I fire

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.600
I fire a flaming arrow

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:26.600
Okay.

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:28.600
At the

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.600
the one in the front.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.600
The one in the front.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.600
Loosing your flaming

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.600
arrow, it hits

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:38.600
critically so.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.600
Dealing.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.600
I can't do math.

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:52.600
16 damage.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.600
Oh, shit.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.600
Your hopping seems to be working.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.600
Putting it in Sharpie's turn.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.600
Oh.

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.600
Sharpie's in the ice buckets.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.600
Sorry. Well, I've been thinking about this

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:16.600
for a while and

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.600
I think a guy died

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.600
in the audience.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.600
Okay.

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.600
I'm up close to all these guys, right?

01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.600
Yeah. I'm in their grill, as the

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.600
urban say.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.600
All right.

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.600
Shocking grasp because I've just had a lot of success

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.600
with that and I just

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.600
I've just had it up to here.

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.600
Having it up to here.

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.600
You lose a shocking grasp.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.600
You

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.600
shall let me

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.600
pass.

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.600
Something like that.

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.600
Dealing 13 damage.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.600
Nice.

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.600
That's a less

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.600
than shocking grasp.

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.600
Am I still tangled up with the guy that I was

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.600
I was close to?

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:12.600
Yeah, you're in a heap.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.600
How high is the railing on this bridge?

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.600
There's no railing.

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:18.600
The flat bridge? Yeah.

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.600
I just use my brute strength and try to just

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.600
grapple them and throw them off the side.

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.600
All right.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.600
You grapple them and you have them firmly,

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.600
but you can't you can't throw them off.

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.600
Right now you're just kind of wrestling with them.

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:32.600
Shit.

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.600
I kiss

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.600
them just to make it creepy.

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.600
Yeah.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.600
Like

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.600
right on the base of the

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.600
ear.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.600
It's

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.600
creepy.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.600
All right.

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.600
He is

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.600
creeped out.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.600
No, they're not affected by

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.600
that, but he neither

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.600
does he manage to wrestle you off of a bridge.

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.600
So you guys are just kind of locked in a

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.600
standstill. Fair enough.

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.600
At the same time,

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.600
two of those skeleton dudes

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.600
that aren't being wrestled

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.600
attack. One lunges

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.600
towards Sharpie having been shocked by

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.600
Sharpie. The other lunges

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.600
at Mulraine. I point out

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.600
as he's attacking me

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.600
that he has no muscle tissue.

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.600
That's a lot of muscle tissue.

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.600
That he's made

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.600
out of pure bone.

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.600
No muscle. No muscle

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.600
tissue. He's an animated

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.600
bone.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.600
Which is lame. He might as well be

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.600
rock.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.600
Or a rainstorm.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.600
I want

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.600
him to know that I'm not

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.600
concerned.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.600
He strikes you dealing

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.600
12

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.600
dead.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.600
Are you concerned

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.600
now?

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.600
You're keeping track

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.600
of my hit points, right?

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.600
Yeah.

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:12.600
Am I dead?

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.600
You have eight left.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.600
Yeah, so I'm like

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.600
is that all you got? That kind of thing.

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.600
The other one

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.600
swings at Mulraine, but she nimbly dodges.

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.600
Now it's Mulraine's turn.

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.600
Okay,

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.600
I'm going to do

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.600
I

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.600
put my hand near

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.600
the face of the monster.

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.600
Not on his face because

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.600
I don't want to hurt him. I put my hand near

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:44.600
the face of the monster

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:46.600
and I make eye contact with his blue

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.600
eyes and I say

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.600
I'm

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.600
you.

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.600
I've similarly

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.600
met adversaries who I didn't understand

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.600
and I want to say

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.600
that I understand you and you can destroy me

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.600
if you'd like, but I just

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.600
want to understand

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.600
and love you and my friends are

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.600
good and we won't hurt you. Please

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.600
let us across your bridge

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.600
also my friend Quirk will blow you

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:22.600
and he will blow

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.600
you.

01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.600
But I'm all teeth.

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.600
But meanwhile, like you're in this hug stand

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:32.600
with one of his friends.

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.600
While that's happening, I'm still kissing a skeleton.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:36.600
We both lock eyes

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.600
and I'm waiting to hear

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.600
see what the response is.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.600
I just want to take it back.

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.600
Can I take it back?

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.600
I don't want it

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.600
to be sexual. I just want it to be human.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.600
I don't say he can blow you, but I do do

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.600
my eyes and I go,

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.600
No, I don't do that.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.600
I just look at him.

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.600
Wait, what do you do then?

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.600
You can also attack these fucking

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.600
things that are getting us.

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:08.600
I use

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:10.600
my diplomacy

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.600
and I

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.600
appeal to their

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.600
their humanity, their

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.600
humanoidity. Their skeletality.

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.600
They have skeletons,

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.600
right guys?

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:24.600
No, we're all bone skeletons

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:26.600
when the flesh goes away.

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:28.600
Yeah.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.600
He strikes you with his frozen

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.600
sword

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.600
dealing eight damage.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.600
All right.

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.600
You know what? And I look at him

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.600
and I say, I get it.

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:46.600
That's fine.

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.600
So maybe next time around

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.600
he'll...

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.600
Turn the other cheek, right?

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.600
Yeah.

01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:56.600
Sometimes I think that these creatures are you.

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:04.600
I know they're probably not, but

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.600
sometimes I think that you're thinking,

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:08.600
Fuck you, Aaron. No, no, no, no.

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.600
That's why they're all skinny.

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:14.600
Wait, you want me to blow Spencer?

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:20.600
Spencer, I'm all teeth.

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.600
Fun question.

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.600
Sharpie, get in the fight.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.600
Yeah, Sharpie's turn.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:38.600
Heal up.

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.600
No, no.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.600
Kick it in the balls.

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.600
That's gorging Ray, no.

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:46.600
Ray Frost.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.600
Ray Frost is a level zero

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.600
spell that does one to three

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:52.600
damage that I was...

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.600
I'd like us to turn it to the Price Is Right.

01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:56.600
Forty-nine cents.

01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:58.600
The Kiddy Litter.

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.600
The Kiddy Litter.

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:02.600
I don't mind it.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:04.600
I do appreciate the input, but I do

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.600
think I have had the best luck with...

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:08.600
And Dan, we are very close to the end of the show.

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.600
So whatever you do,

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:12.600
put a flourish on it.

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.600
It zooms into my eye

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.600
and then you see my dad

01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:18.600
hitting me with a belt again.

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:22.600
And then it comes back out

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.600
and you just see...

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.600
and this is my gimmick.

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.600
It's just...

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.600
Choo, choo,

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.600
shocking grasp!

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.600
And I grab one of the skeletons.

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:36.600
I'm not reinventing the wheel.

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:40.600
Yeah, yeah, you do grab the skeletons.

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:44.600
Dealing.

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.600
16 damage.

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.600
You hear a sizzling sound

01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:54.600
from Deeth within it,

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.600
and then it catches fire

01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:58.600
and falls to the ground.

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.600
Dan!

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:04.600
I say,

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.600
uh...

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.600
I can't riff one.

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.600
Looks like you're...

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.600
Have Anatoly help you.

01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:14.600
Anatoly?

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:16.600
Direct the last line of this episode.

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:18.600
What would he say right now?

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:20.600
What would you say if you're

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:22.600
killing a skeleton?

01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:24.600
That's made of ice.

01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.600
You can use ice puns too.

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.600
Ah, fuck.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.600
I have one.

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:32.600
Fuck!

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.600
Thank you for coming to Harmontown.

01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:36.600
What's up?

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:38.600
We love you all.

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:40.600
One more time for Erin McGathy

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:42.600
and Spencer Crittenden.

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:44.600
And how about

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.600
James Rabaniak

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.600
and Gibran.

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.600
Anatoly, thank you so much for your good luck

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:52.600
with your studies.

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.600
And Alice Rubin is the writer

01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:56.600
of the community.

01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:58.600
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:02.600
Dan Harmon, your Mayor, everybody.

01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.600
We won't be here for you.

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:06.600
I'll see you at Comic-Con,

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:08.600
but we're not going to do a show on Sunday,

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:10.600
so see you the Sunday after next.

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:12.600
But I'll see you in San Diego, I assume, right?

01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:14.600
Yeah!

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.600
And thank you Farrell Audio

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:18.600
and all of your great content.

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.600
Yes, thank you Farrell Audio

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:22.600
and all your brilliant content. Good night.

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:28.600
Thank you!

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.600
If I could have your attention, please.

01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:44.600
For everyone's safety,

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.600
we are now entering full lockdown mode.

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.600
You should at this point

01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:50.600
be gathered in the dining hall

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:52.600
that is our main assembly point

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:54.600
and safe room.

01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:56.600
If any of you are still in the quadrangle

01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:58.600
or any of the offices or labs,

01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.600
please find alternate containment.

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.600
Lock yourself in somewhere if you can

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.600
and wait for the resistance.

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.600
To those of you already assembled

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.600
in the dining hall,

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.600
I need you all to be sitting on the floor

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:12.600
below window level.

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.600
Remain low and quiet.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.600
All the doors and windows should be

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:20.600
automatically sealed at this point.

01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.600
An enforcement team is on their way

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:24.600
to contain the threat.

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.600
At this time, the best thing you can do

01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.600
is remain calm.

01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:30.600
Do not react vocally

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:32.600
if you hear shots fired.

01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.600
Do not attempt to move the wounded.

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:36.600
If you find yourself

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:38.600
in possession of a weapon,

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.600
discard it immediately.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.600
You do not want to cause any confusion

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.600
or confusion

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.600
for the enforcement team

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:48.600
when they arrive.

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:50.600
Remember the acronym

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.600
elbow.

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:54.600
Evacuate,

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.600
lock down,

01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.600
blockade, obey,

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.600
and wait.

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.600
As always, there is no smoking

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.600
in the dining hall.

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:06.600
Shit.

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.600
I forgot to mention the closure

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:10.600
of the concourse tube.

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:12.600
I know I forgot something.

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.600
I can't go back on like now.

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:16.600
I look like I don't know what I'm doing.

01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:18.600
We can't afford to compromise

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.600
any confidence people have at me at this point.

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.600
Most people don't even know

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:24.600
who the fuck I am.

01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:26.600
A kid had to take out a fucking

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:28.600
reconnaissance pod full of officers.

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:30.600
Officers shouldn't be allowed to all ride

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.600
in the same pod at once. I've always said that.

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:36.600
But that mostly worked, right, Karen?

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:38.600
I hear all the technical stuff.

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.600
When the Kronos was remodeled

01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:42.600
a few years ago, the term

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:44.600
quadrangle was replaced with

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.600
access square.

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.600
Okay, well no one cares about that.

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:50.600
I got everything else correct?

01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:52.600
All relevant aspects of the ship's

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:54.600
lockdown procedure were communicated.

01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:56.600
Should I have made an emotional appeal?

01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.600
We'll fight them on the beaches kind of thing?

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.600
I mean, I'm supposed to be a leader here.

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.600
In situations such as this,

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.600
a tone of technical clarity

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.600
is usually best.

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:08.600
Well, you would say that. You're a computer.

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.600
With an empathy chip as per the

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:12.600
I know, I know, your empathy chip.

01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:14.600
Can you try to get hold of enforcement sector again?

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:18.600
The frequency is still

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:20.600
blocked.

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.600
Okay, fuck it.

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:24.600
This is Captain James

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:26.600
or Baniak again.

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:28.600
I just want to say that I have

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:30.600
total confidence that

01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:32.600
the situation will soon be eradicated.

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:34.600
This ship survived

01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:36.600
the Maltan III contamination

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.600
when a meteoroid

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.600
punched a hole through our main thruster.

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.600
We all pitched in.

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:44.600
And last cycle, when the Azalean seized

01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.600
sector nine, the members of the Kronos

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:48.600
were among those thanked by the OSR Alliance

01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:50.600
at their victory statement.

01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:52.600
We have been through this before

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:54.600
and we'll get through it again.

01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.600
That's what we do.

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.600
Oh, and by the way, the concourse tube has been closed.

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:04.600
I will provide you with further updates as I receive them.

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.600
Most people who do this kind of attack,

01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:12.600
they usually kill themselves at some point, right?

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:16.600
Can you get a location

01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:18.600
off his internal transponder?

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:20.600
Internal transponder 742

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:22.600
has been disabled.

01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:24.600
Of course it has.

01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:26.600
It's always the tech guys who go nuts, isn't it?

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.600
Christ.

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:30.600
Karen, how many people are in the dining hall?

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.600
731.

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:34.600
Okay.

01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:36.600
Well,

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:38.600
there's nothing else I can do, right?

01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:42.600
We'll just sit tight.

01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:44.600
Like I said.

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:48.600
Can you double check the seal on the door?

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:50.600
The dining hall door is sealed.

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:52.600
No, no. My door.

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:54.600
Main cabin.

01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.600
The main cabin door is sealed.

01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:18.600
Thank you, Karen.

01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:28.600
James.

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:30.600
Yes, Karen?

01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:34.600
I would advise against listening to music at this time.

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:36.600
Thank you for your opinion.

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:38.600
It helps me concentrate.

01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:40.600
Any word from enforcement?

01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:42.600
The frequency is still blocked.

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:44.600
Of course it is.

01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:46.600
Well,

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:48.600
be careful what you wish for.

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.600
Not that I ever wish to be a captain.

01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:54.600
Do you know how many people had to die

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.600
for me to get to this position?

01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:58.600
Six.

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:00.600
Six people.

01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.600
This was never meant to happen.

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:06.600
Some are born great.

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.600
Some achieve greatness.

01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:10.600
And some have greatness thrust upon them.

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:16.600
That's Shakespeare, Karen.

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.600
I know, James.

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:20.600
Of course you know.

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.600
Ken, you appreciate it.

01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:24.600
Ken, you appreciate it.

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:26.600
Can you appreciate this music, Karen?

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.600
Schubert.

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:32.600
Sonata number 20.

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:34.600
D9-59.

01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:36.600
In A major.

01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:38.600
Movement 2.

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.600
Andantino.

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.600
I can recognize its calming effects.

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:44.600
Have we reached a singularity, Karen?

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:46.600
I wanted to be a musician.

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:52.600
Karen, calculate the shortest route

01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:54.600
from main cabin to emergency escape pod 1.

01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:56.600
Calculating.

01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:58.600
Exit main cabin.

01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:00.600
Turn left down corridor A.

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:02.600
Proceed 6.2 meters.

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:04.600
Lower into officer's hatch

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:06.600
located on floor.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:08.600
Enter emergency pod bay.

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:10.600
Okay, great.

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.600
Thank you.

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:14.600
Are you planning on leaving, James?

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:16.600
What? No.

01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:18.600
No, I just wanted to know.

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.600
In case we had to evacuate people.

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:22.600
There are 10 emergency escape pods.

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:24.600
Each pod has a 10-passenger capacity limit.

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:26.600
There are currently 730 persons

01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:28.600
in the dining hall.

01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:30.600
Awesome.

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.600
What time does the south bound

01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.600
to Long Branch leave Penn Station?

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:36.600
Insufficient data

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:38.600
does not compute.

01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:40.600
Very funny.

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:46.600
My vital scan

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:48.600
has returned an increase

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:50.600
in your pulse rate, James.

01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:52.600
Wait, 730 persons?

01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:54.600
I thought before you said 731.

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.600
There are currently

01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:58.600
730 persons in the dining hall.

01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:00.600
And no one can get out or in, right?

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:02.600
That's correct.

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:04.600
Holy shit. This is not good, Karen.

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:06.600
Not good.

01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:08.600
Have we heard from enforcement?

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:10.600
Still blocked.

01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.600
Karen, do you remember

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:18.600
Klavdia?

01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:20.600
Klavdia, Rabinovich,

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.600
Expeditions Unit,

01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:24.600
Biosciences Sector,

01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:26.600
Age, 38.

01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:28.600
Yes.

01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:30.600
I met her

01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:32.600
on the observation deck

01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:34.600
at the Inorganic Morphons Conference last cycle.

01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:38.600
We were both ducking out.

01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:42.600
I was supposed to give a talk that night

01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:44.600
and I ended up

01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:46.600
well, not giving a talk.

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:50.600
We found an unoccupied conference room

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:52.600
and kept the lights off.

01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:54.600
No one found us.

01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:00.600
A week and a half later,

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:02.600
a week and a half,

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:04.600
the Azalean conflict breaks out

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:06.600
and the next thing I hear,

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:08.600
she's up in a medic unit

01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:10.600
on Sector 9,

01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:12.600
extensive injuries.

01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:14.600
She's lost a foot,

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:16.600
got an infection

01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:18.600
and she images me to come see her.

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:24.600
And I come see her.

01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:26.600
I go up there.

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.600
I bring her real cherry blossoms

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:30.600
from the farm deck.

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:32.600
I mean, they fall apart

01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:34.600
in a second in that atmosphere,

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.600
but it's the thought.

01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:38.600
I walk into her room.

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.600
She's in pretty bad shape.

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:44.600
But she gives me a big smile.

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:46.600
But she gives me a big smile.

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.600
And she has friends there.

01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.600
Family.

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:54.600
Her mom is there.

01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:58.600
We've met less than two weeks ago

01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.600
and I'm meeting her mom.

01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:04.600
I'm being introduced to everybody.

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:08.600
Everything was suddenly

01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:10.600
really accelerated.

01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:12.600
Accelerated.

01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:16.600
And after that,

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:18.600
I didn't come back anymore.

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.600
I made excuses.

01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:26.600
Then I stopped returning her images.

01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:28.600
I called the medic center

01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:30.600
anonymously a couple times to check her status.

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:34.600
Eventually they told me she got discharged.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:38.600
And that was that.

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.600
I got scared, Karen.

01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:50.600
I couldn't commit.

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:54.600
If you are implying

01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:56.600
that you are incapable of taking charge

01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:58.600
of this command post,

01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.600
I was built by Halstead Corporation

01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:02.600
under specification of the

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:04.600
Intelligence Designation Ordinance

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.600
and am programmed to take over

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:08.600
any and all responsibilities of said post

01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:10.600
as defined by the revised

01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:12.600
charter of the Council of 2063.

01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:14.600
In other words,

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.600
in the event of the person in command

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:18.600
being incapacitated,

01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:20.600
I am able and authorized to take over this ship.

01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:24.600
You have been placed in command through a council

01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:26.600
of your peers.

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.600
Your vital scans are normal.

01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:30.600
Your brain scans are normal.

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.600
You have sustained no injuries.

01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:34.600
Is this information correct?

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:38.600
Yes, it is.

01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:40.600
You are not incapacitated.

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.600
Are you, James?

01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:44.600
No, I'm not.

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.600
Thank you, Karen.

01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:48.600
No problem.

01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:54.600
Internal transponder 742

01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:56.600
is back online.

01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.600
Jesus Christ, where is he?

01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:00.600
The intersection of Corridor B

01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:02.600
and Dining Hall.

01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:04.600
He appears to be stationary.

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:06.600
His vitals are normal.

01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:08.600
Okay.

01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:10.600
Okay, okay.

01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.600
Okay.

01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:14.600
How do you want to proceed?

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.600
Evacuate, lock down, blockade,

01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:18.600
obey and wait.

01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:20.600
Those are civilian commands, Captain.

01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:22.600
Right. I know that.

01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:24.600
There is a level 100

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:26.600
incapacitator located in the

01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:28.600
top right console of the cabin desk.

01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:30.600
I know that.

01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:32.600
I fucking know that.

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:34.600
Please calculate the shortest route

01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:36.600
from main cabin to the intersection

01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:38.600
of Corridor B and Dining Hall.

01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:40.600
Calculating.

01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:42.600
And Karen? Yes.

01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:44.600
Beethoven, Symphony 7,

01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:46.600
Movement 2,

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:48.600
Allegretto.

01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:50.600
Accessing.

01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:52.600
Exit main cabin.

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:54.600
Turn right down corridor A.

01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:56.600
20 meters.

01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.600
Enter service module.

01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:00.600
Proceed to Corridor B.

01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.600
Proceed 15 meters to Dining Hall.

01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:04.600
I need a temporary override

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:06.600
on the electronic reference device.

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.600
Access to the tactical airlock.

01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:10.600
An open line to orbit com.

01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:14.600
Okay. Karen?

01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:16.600
Please unseal main cabin door.

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:26.600
Please unseal main cabin door.

01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:50.600
Please unseal main cabin door.

01:57:50.600 --> 01:58:00.600
Please unseal main cabin door.
