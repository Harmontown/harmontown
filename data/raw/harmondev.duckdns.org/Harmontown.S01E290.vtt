It was all about me\n\n19:10.980 --> 19:13.700\nBut then I thought what about the voices we don't get to hear\n\n19:13.700 --> 19:20.580\nAnd I it was then that I've decided to start using my podcast as a signal boost\n\n19:21.220 --> 19:23.220\nFor the unheard voices of America\n\n19:24.100 --> 19:26.100\nPlease welcome jet apatow\n\n19:37.380 --> 19:39.540\nThank you pretty funny intro\n\n19:39.540 --> 19:41.540\nSo\n\n19:41.940 --> 19:43.940\nThey went for it you'll edit out the first part\n\n19:44.820 --> 19:46.820\nWe're gonna have to yeah, I guess\n\n19:48.100 --> 19:50.420\nWhich you don't know is we're gonna do four more\n\n19:50.980 --> 19:52.980\nInteractions of this\n\n19:53.540 --> 19:55.540\nThis is the whole time you're on stage\n\n19:56.100 --> 20:02.340\nThis show is heavily edited, right?

Let's go stand less. Yeah\n\n20:46.740 --> 20:48.740\nHow many pianos are there\n\n20:51.540 --> 20:56.900\nSeems like a complicated way to hold a microphone and you know the real irony zero typewriters\n\n20:59.380 --> 21:01.380\nNo, there's one typewriter\n\n21:01.380 --> 21:05.140\nOh, wait, he's he's got a stand, too\n\n21:14.580 --> 21:18.500\nAnd we don't even want him he's right here the whole time and you move the piano\n\n21:25.380 --> 21:27.380\nHate them hate stands\n\n21:27.380 --> 21:33.940\nI never realized how insulting they are like like oh, can I hold that for you?

Thank you for the\n\n21:42.180 --> 21:47.220\nDo you do you play a little piano Judd, uh, I only know one thing uh, here we go lay it on us\n\n21:52.020 --> 21:54.020\nYeah\n\n21:54.020 --> 21:56.020\nNow\n\n21:57.220 --> 22:01.140\nWithin the category of people that learned anything on piano, that's lazy\n\n22:02.420 --> 22:07.540\nBecause you stopped that's like stopping a shave and a haircut and never learning two bits\n\n22:11.940 --> 22:17.300\nOkay, he just but he was improvising I figured that out he inverted the first part\n\n22:18.580 --> 22:22.020\nBack when he was eight his mom was like judge if you know mom it's hard\n\n22:22.020 --> 22:27.140\nI'm tired of it. You just wanted a microphone stand. I thought you wanted like like a piece of furniture\n\n22:27.460 --> 22:29.460\nThat could have saved me a whole lot of calories\n\n22:30.740 --> 22:32.740\nWell, you did get him a piece of furniture\n\n22:33.300 --> 22:37.860\nYou're you're just like a Victorian lord over there. Oh, yeah\n\n22:39.060 --> 22:44.020\nThis desk is outstanding. Well, I'll start by asking probably it might be a question you've been asked before\n\n22:44.100 --> 22:47.140\nCan everyone in the building have a job? Yes. Yes\n\n22:47.140 --> 22:54.100\nUh, do you do you have to it is like, oh, is your interview going to be about what it's like to be, uh,\n\n22:54.980 --> 22:58.260\nfamous, uh, is that is that is that is that something that worries you?\n\n22:58.900 --> 23:03.060\nWhat it's like to be famous. No to be interviewed by somebody that's just going to do that instead of, uh,\n\n23:04.180 --> 23:10.260\nLike like like like like talking about you as if you're an inhuman demagogue and like wondering what you're asking\n\n23:10.260 --> 23:13.780\nLike what what's it like and are there no, I like it. I like it. Okay. Okay\n\n23:13.780 --> 23:19.140\nI this is my level of fame. I just I I was at Disneyland and somebody said to me\n\n23:19.380 --> 23:22.580\nThey said, you know, if someone asks for your autograph at Disneyland\n\n23:22.900 --> 23:27.700\nThey will send security over and they will let you cut the lines the rest of the day\n\n23:28.820 --> 23:32.580\nYou know, so it's like tom hanks goes. It's a security problem that people started asking for autographs\n\n23:32.900 --> 23:35.380\nSo I think it said two people asked for your autograph\n\n23:35.860 --> 23:39.860\nSecurity will walk you around the rest of the day and let you cut the lines\n\n23:39.860 --> 23:43.540\nSo the next time I went to Disneyland, I wore a 40-year-old virgin t-shirt\n\n23:45.380 --> 23:47.780\nAnd I did not get asked for an autograph\n\n23:48.500 --> 23:50.500\nOne time I was looking at people's eyes\n\n23:50.580 --> 23:51.940\nso\n\n23:51.940 --> 23:58.180\nYou may have a dysmorphia about my level of uh of success and awareness. That is an insane distracting\n\n23:58.660 --> 23:59.940\nuh\n\n23:59.940 --> 24:02.420\npolicy on their part. I mean, I thought like\n\n24:03.380 --> 24:07.860\nThat how does that make you feel when you hear that it doesn't that makes fills me with panic\n\n24:07.860 --> 24:11.540\nLike oh, it makes me so happy because then I figured out how to crack the code\n\n24:11.860 --> 24:16.900\nWhich is I bring my wife, right? That's one person and then it's easier, but it doesn't work solo\n\n24:17.700 --> 24:22.580\nHow do you how do you verify that you have to walk up to somebody that's an employee there and say hello\n\n24:22.900 --> 24:26.100\nMy name is jen epitow. I haven't asked for two autographs\n\n24:29.460 --> 24:31.460\nI'm in a real hurry\n\n24:31.540 --> 24:33.780\nYou know, you have to be the lamest person in the world to do it\n\n24:33.780 --> 24:37.860\nBut when you're cutting the lines, it's so worth it like every second of it. Yeah\n\n24:38.100 --> 24:43.300\nI mean, we'd almost do anything to cut a line. I would imagine but that's why it's like it's like\n\n24:43.460 --> 24:49.060\nYeah, because people like going wheelchairs. They put on fake casts and going wheelchairs to cut lines\n\n24:49.540 --> 24:53.940\nSo you got to do what you got to do. You know, it's cool now like because I'm not famous, but I\n\n24:55.380 --> 24:57.780\nI am occasionally on whose line is it anyway\n\n24:58.260 --> 25:02.340\nEverybody that everybody that works at uh, disneyland is 24\n\n25:02.340 --> 25:06.020\nThey all are theater kids. They all took an improv class\n\n25:07.300 --> 25:12.180\nSo church my girlfriend and I we went there and we were like way more famous than you there because\n\n25:14.900 --> 25:16.900\nWell, there are VIPs\n\n25:17.460 --> 25:22.420\nCertain spaces where you're famous, but only in like that room, right, you know, yeah\n\n25:22.420 --> 25:28.820\nIt was good because that but that's gonna stop in three years because they're all gonna be too old and no one's gonna know\n\n25:28.820 --> 25:30.180\nWho the fuck I am\n\n25:30.180 --> 25:33.540\nBut they're gonna know who you are, but you have to not you have to wear the right shirt\n\n25:34.900 --> 25:42.660\nI have to wear a portial version t-shirt. I'm impressed and uh, uh, yeah that it's not an out of swarm because my panic\n\n25:42.900 --> 25:46.020\nI would imagine imagining life in your shoes and be like, well\n\n25:47.540 --> 25:51.700\nIt's there. It's that it's that can I have a job thing like it's all like like like you're\n\n25:52.340 --> 25:56.500\nYour your brand is that you can give people movies. Yeah\n\n25:56.500 --> 25:58.500\nI\n\n25:58.900 --> 26:03.620\nLike it just seems kind of dangerous. It's like I'm only famous for he might yell at you if he's drunk\n\n26:04.900 --> 26:06.900\nlike\n\n26:07.220 --> 26:15.460\nBut like to be to be kind of like that that's that's part of your brand like like that that would be not only like an invitation for a lot of like\n\n26:17.860 --> 26:23.620\nKind kinds of conversations that would make me very anxious. Well, like it's sundance is a bad place for me to go\n\n26:23.620 --> 26:28.660\nBecause if I walk up or down the street and sundance and everyone's kind of just looking for anyone who makes movies\n\n26:29.220 --> 26:32.820\nYou know they spot you and now they hand you like memory sticks\n\n26:33.220 --> 26:35.220\nWhich have a screenplay on them\n\n26:35.460 --> 26:39.620\nWhich you really can't put a strange memory stick into your computer, right?\n\n26:40.980 --> 26:43.780\nThat could be anything really that might be anything\n\n26:44.580 --> 26:49.540\nThat might be something awful that goes into your computer. I told I've told the story of this podcast before but the what the\n\n26:49.540 --> 26:55.620\nIt's it was I did a panel and a girl came up and she said mr. Harmon\n\n26:55.860 --> 27:00.980\nI'm such an admirer of your work. Like, um, do you think I can I please like\n\n27:01.940 --> 27:04.900\nI know this is crazy, but I just always wanted to be a writer and\n\n27:05.380 --> 27:06.900\nI oh like I\n\n27:06.900 --> 27:11.300\nYou're a role model to me and and if you it would just mean a lot if you would sign\n\n27:11.860 --> 27:15.540\nUh my screenplay and and I'm like, oh, you know, no problem\n\n27:15.540 --> 27:19.220\nI get here. I like of course, I'll do this thing that you're telling me is crazy\n\n27:19.700 --> 27:24.900\nI think and and like so I take it and I sign it and she goes and if you could read it that'd be great and walked away\n\n27:27.140 --> 27:32.500\nNow do you ever for the hell of it read a stranger's screenplay like would you ever just read that?\n\n27:32.580 --> 27:38.100\nI had I had to open that one because because my religion dictated that I needed that girl to be a bad writer\n\n27:38.260 --> 27:40.100\nin that\n\n27:40.100 --> 27:44.420\nIs that like because what if she's good and I and I just throw it in the garbage because I felt like\n\n27:44.420 --> 27:46.420\nYeah, like how dare she\n\n27:46.980 --> 27:51.140\nSo I was like, I got to fucking read it and I'm like three pages and I'm like, yeah, that's pretty sweaty\n\n27:53.300 --> 27:57.300\nJudd, how did uh like Camille and emily come to you with the big sec\n\n27:57.780 --> 28:04.580\nWere you pals with him before that? Well, no, not at all. I I went to Atlanta. I don't like Austin\n\n28:04.820 --> 28:06.820\nHaven't seen it\n\n28:07.780 --> 28:12.340\nIt's very good to show the first episode of girls and\n\n28:12.340 --> 28:13.700\nuh\n\n28:13.700 --> 28:21.780\nDave raffa who is a manager for Pete Holmes said will you do Pete Holmes podcast and I said who's Pete Holmes and\n\n28:22.740 --> 28:26.180\nPete Holmes popped out of a bush and went he's an experience\n\n28:28.820 --> 28:30.820\nI love I love Pete Holmes\n\n28:32.100 --> 28:37.140\nBut at the time I wasn't doing stand-up and I didn't really know who anybody was I was really out of the loop\n\n28:37.620 --> 28:39.620\nand so I showed up and it was\n\n28:39.620 --> 28:43.620\nUh, Pete Holmes was interviewing Camille and uh, Chris gethard\n\n28:44.180 --> 28:49.540\nUh, and I think Todd Barry and uh, I love Todd. He's great. We we met on stage\n\n28:49.940 --> 28:53.140\nAnd then it was just really weird that over the next few years\n\n28:53.700 --> 28:57.220\nI I produced Chris's uh one-man show\n\n28:58.500 --> 29:01.540\nAnd uh, and then I'm now working with Pete on\n\n29:02.180 --> 29:05.380\nCrashing and worked with Camille. So it was the most productive\n\n29:05.380 --> 29:11.380\npodcast of all time and then he came in and he pitched me this crazy story about\n\n29:12.020 --> 29:12.900\num\n\n29:12.900 --> 29:18.900\nEmily and the coma and all of it and I just thought I'm not no one has a story that good like everyone\n\n29:19.540 --> 29:21.540\nNo one's like anecdote of their life\n\n29:21.780 --> 29:26.900\nYeah, it's just dark enough too because it like makes you have to wonder well if I had one date and then\n\n29:27.620 --> 29:28.980\nit's like\n\n29:28.980 --> 29:32.260\nIt's like it's like a it's like a thing that feels just a little too dark to\n\n29:32.260 --> 29:36.900\nYeah, to to make jokes about uh, or you know what I go there, which is like always\n\n29:37.860 --> 29:40.500\nAnd he said, you know, I fell in love with her while she was in the coma\n\n29:41.060 --> 29:45.220\nAnd I thought well that seems like a good movie, but at the time I didn't really even know Camille\n\n29:45.540 --> 29:49.700\nI didn't really but I thought this is a great idea. Does anybody really know Camille?\n\n29:51.220 --> 29:53.220\nYou can't know Camille\n\n29:54.660 --> 29:57.140\nYou can only know my horrible impression of him\n\n29:57.140 --> 30:05.140\nI've never heard one of those. That's pretty good. I worked with him for four years. I don't have any impression\n\n30:05.140 --> 30:07.140\nI cannot do a Camille impression\n\n30:07.140 --> 30:13.700\nSo we think you know how every like if you're a bad impression officer James Adomian has a different fucking process than me for his impressions\n\n30:14.340 --> 30:15.380\nbut uh\n\n30:15.380 --> 30:18.660\nLike you know, like if you want to if you're if you're not if you don't do impressions\n\n30:18.660 --> 30:24.900\nBut you want to try to do one you there's like a phrase or a word that you that you get that gets you started like for\n\n30:24.900 --> 30:28.100\nCamille it's it's it's cunt because that's how he says can't\n\n30:28.980 --> 30:30.980\nOh\n\n30:31.540 --> 30:34.740\nThat's right. It was funny like I thought I wouldn't have done. Oh, what did you call me?\n\n30:36.260 --> 30:40.980\nI'd like to hear an extended Camille impression. Like can you keep going? No, I don't want you because\n\n30:41.460 --> 30:43.460\nBe Camille in and out of\n\n30:44.740 --> 30:50.260\nA Burger King drive-through and try to order something as Camille, but you cannot use the word cunt\n\n30:52.500 --> 30:54.180\nYou have to use every word but that\n\n30:54.180 --> 30:57.700\nNow you have given people opportunities that change their life\n\n30:58.740 --> 31:00.740\nI don't know about that\n\n31:03.700 --> 31:08.180\nDoesn't look like a changed life, but I'm still I'm still working at the apple store\n\n31:09.620 --> 31:12.340\nThis this this used to be an apple store\n\n31:13.300 --> 31:15.300\nBut it was pretty much\n\n31:15.460 --> 31:18.020\nHis desk wasn't always an Edwardian\n\n31:18.020 --> 31:24.420\nUm, beautifully enameled desk like he's really moved up. Yeah. Well, I mean, but you you've\n\n31:25.460 --> 31:28.820\nHow much of you pays that forward because as we were discussing backstage\n\n31:29.780 --> 31:33.940\nYour term was the patient zero. I was using neither of these phrases are going to be flattering to him\n\n31:34.500 --> 31:38.980\nBut ben stiller is like that you call them the patient zero. I call them the the lastot\n\n31:41.460 --> 31:43.460\nBen ben like\n\n31:43.460 --> 31:48.020\nLet's use the term very loosely because you're you're you're a self-starter and you he\n\n31:48.580 --> 31:54.580\nBut he he discovered plucked you whatever phrase you want. He was like ben grabbed you and and it was the ben stiller show\n\n31:55.380 --> 31:56.900\nLike you were\n\n31:56.900 --> 32:02.580\nWhat was your title on that? Were you ep? Well, I know I was the executive producer, but that was just a funny moment\n\n32:02.980 --> 32:04.420\nin time I was uh\n\n32:04.420 --> 32:08.100\nMy main job then was I was writing hbo specials for tom Arnold\n\n32:08.100 --> 32:13.140\nAnd I wrote rosanne's act with her for a year and I was doing a lot of like\n\n32:14.020 --> 32:17.300\nTom Arnold special where he does the uh, my big penis\n\n32:18.660 --> 32:20.660\nMy big penis\n\n32:20.660 --> 32:23.700\nIt was at a stand-up special or like he well, it was like a it was like a\n\n32:24.580 --> 32:28.500\nPre-tape sketch that that that that did that was part of a special\n\n32:29.620 --> 32:31.620\nIt could be to the tune of my shirona\n\n32:32.900 --> 32:34.900\nMy big penis\n\n32:34.900 --> 32:36.900\nMy shirona\n\n32:38.580 --> 32:43.060\nThings that like no one remembers at all like there were three tom Arnold specials\n\n32:43.220 --> 32:47.460\nThere'd be kind of like a sketch and then it would turn into like a piece of like tom trying to solve a problem\n\n32:47.460 --> 32:53.460\nLike almost like a reality comedy piece. It was called tom Arnold the naked truth. How many people saw one of those?\n\n32:54.500 --> 32:56.100\nOh damn\n\n32:56.100 --> 32:58.420\nLike two people. This is how fast the culture\n\n32:59.060 --> 33:01.060\nDiscards greatness. Yeah\n\n33:01.060 --> 33:09.780\nWell comedy doesn't age well, but also old people like they I mean this is it's about a while old people age great\n\n33:11.140 --> 33:15.620\nThat's their main thing. You know why it's weird is I always think like that was 20\n\n33:16.500 --> 33:21.700\nUh six 27 years ago. What was it? What was the bits like like what would I remember after that?\n\n33:21.780 --> 33:24.260\nWell, we went to the mall and chris farley\n\n33:24.660 --> 33:30.340\nThere was a piece about how to pick up women and we we shot chris farley walking around a mall hitting on strangers\n\n33:30.340 --> 33:32.340\nLike with the hidden cameras\n\n33:32.580 --> 33:39.940\nWhen no one knew chris farley was so actual like like candy camera. That's what one of the bits was one of the bits was and uh\n\n33:40.580 --> 33:45.220\nWhat was it on like it was on hbo, but but I always look at it like this like when I was a kid in\n\n33:46.340 --> 33:48.340\n1977\n\n33:48.980 --> 33:50.980\n27 years earlier\n\n33:50.980 --> 33:52.980\nwas 1950\n\n33:53.460 --> 33:54.820\nso\n\n33:54.820 --> 33:55.700\nfrom\n\n33:55.700 --> 33:57.700\nThe Ben Stiller show from here\n\n33:57.700 --> 34:04.900\nIs 1950 right? Yeah, I know it's crazy when you through realize that it's like I keep I keep think of well\n\n34:04.900 --> 34:08.500\nYou know, mr. Show was the most recent good sketch show and\n\n34:09.700 --> 34:11.700\nNo, we're all dying\n\n34:12.980 --> 34:15.700\nI I hung out with mark mckinney in new york and\n\n34:17.220 --> 34:19.220\nI was like\n\n34:19.220 --> 34:20.260\nWhy do you look so good?\n\n34:20.260 --> 34:25.700\nAnd it was like oh because because we've gotten so old that he's now injured a second phase of his life where he's now\n\n34:25.700 --> 34:27.700\nHe's a handsome old man\n\n34:28.820 --> 34:30.820\nI hope he doesn't hear that\n\n34:31.300 --> 34:36.740\nBut it's like it's like it's like we there's some some of some of our peers are getting handsome again\n\n34:36.980 --> 34:40.820\nIt's been so long and we're so close to death. Yeah, they're um\n\n34:41.380 --> 34:46.180\nJen Jen I I've recently become kind of palsy with uh with uh\n\n34:46.980 --> 34:50.980\nFig like that's with pofig and you dress like pofig. Well, he no he dresses better\n\n34:51.060 --> 34:54.820\nYes, because because he has pofig did not used to wear suits all the time\n\n34:54.820 --> 34:59.380\nHe used to wear bowling shirts all the time. Yes, he did and on a dime. He went suit\n\n34:59.860 --> 35:04.900\nYeah, just on a dime like by the way starting tomorrow. I will wear a suit every day for the rest of my life\n\n35:05.540 --> 35:07.540\nI was I was talking to my girlfriend\n\n35:07.540 --> 35:13.460\nLike if we had all the money in the world, we would just dress like fancy at all times and like bespoke shit\n\n35:13.860 --> 35:17.700\nBut paul does like paul really has bespoke shoes and suits\n\n35:17.860 --> 35:21.380\nYeah, and I went the other way which is about three years ago\n\n35:21.380 --> 35:27.940\nI decided that every day of my life. I would wear a black james purse polo shirt\n\n35:32.260 --> 35:34.260\nI just I just uh\n\n35:34.500 --> 35:40.420\nKept wearing Rick and Morty shirts until there were so many people watching at the 20% of the people were nazis and then\n\n35:40.420 --> 35:50.100\nBecause it's a good show that's loved by a lot of really wonderful people and there's good there's good people on both sides\n\n35:52.900 --> 35:56.980\nBut but and I was like I can't and now it's what it really was it was it wasn't because of that\n\n35:56.980 --> 36:02.660\nI'm being glib but but uh, um, but it was because actually oh the shows become so popular that I don't want to look like\n\n36:02.740 --> 36:07.460\nI'm trying doing the this is 40 t-shirt thing and so well you weren't at disneyland\n\n36:07.460 --> 36:12.980\nSo now I just have I'm just rotating between three henleys because I finally found out henleys are slimming. That's it\n\n36:13.540 --> 36:16.980\nBut this is what we do because we we don't want to exercise\n\n36:17.300 --> 36:23.060\nWe don't really want to eat well and we're just searching for a shirt that makes us look kind of shitty. Yeah\n\n36:24.900 --> 36:31.380\nThis is 45 and 50. Um, I want to go backwards but because the show is brought to you by men's rights activists\n\n36:31.380 --> 36:36.580\nUm, the the\n\n36:38.420 --> 36:40.980\nActually, let's rewind just a little bit before Ben's because\n\n36:42.180 --> 36:46.820\nI didn't know that so my imagining was like I was picturing Ben plucking you from like\n\n36:47.380 --> 36:53.300\nI think you started, uh, like when you were in high school, you were your mom was working at a, uh, uh\n\n36:54.100 --> 36:56.100\nNo, gee, Dan. Did you read his wikipedia page?\n\n36:56.180 --> 36:58.660\nUm, your mom was your mom was working at a comedy club\n\n36:58.660 --> 37:03.700\nYeah, my parents got divorced so my mom was seating people at a comedy club because my parents used to own a restaurant\n\n37:03.940 --> 37:07.780\nAnd the guy was the bartender who went on to become like a big, uh\n\n37:08.500 --> 37:13.060\nManager of the Tim Allen and Drew Carey this guy rick. Messina. He opened a it was rick\n\n37:13.300 --> 37:17.700\nIt was rick and he opened a comedy club on Long Island. So in the aftermath of this terrible divorce\n\n37:18.260 --> 37:24.260\nmy mom who was broke was just she was seating people at a comedy club and uh,\n\n37:24.260 --> 37:32.020\nAnd uh, so that was maybe 1982 or something that that summer how old were you and I was, uh, you know, uh 15 or 14\n\n37:32.900 --> 37:35.140\nIt's kind of like there's there's there's kids these days\n\n37:35.220 --> 37:38.580\nIt would be a podcast now, but it's like there's that archetype where it's like\n\n37:39.300 --> 37:42.500\nThere's the there's the mogul that pays it back\n\n37:42.820 --> 37:49.060\nAnd then there's the there's also but you started as that kind of like self-starting precocious guy that who\n\n37:49.060 --> 37:55.780\nThrough your mom's job. You were getting like headliners to come and do your interview show that you did for what?\n\n37:55.860 --> 38:00.580\nAV club in high school or for the high school radio station that really didn't even get out of the parking lot\n\n38:00.980 --> 38:04.260\nAnd so because what happened is I went to the see all the comedy shows all summer\n\n38:04.260 --> 38:07.700\nAnd it was like Paul Provenza and Jay Leno and people like that\n\n38:08.020 --> 38:11.140\nAnd I just in my little teenage head. I thought I need to meet them\n\n38:11.620 --> 38:14.580\nHow can I meet them and I had a friend who used to interview rock bands?\n\n38:14.580 --> 38:19.620\nLike REM like when they first started for the high school radio station and he's like maybe you could start a show\n\n38:19.620 --> 38:25.300\nWhere you interview comics and that'll be an excuse to call them and then I would call them and uh\n\n38:25.620 --> 38:33.220\nI the first interview I did was Steve Allen and I I show up. I didn't have a tape recorder. I literally brought a boom box\n\n38:34.580 --> 38:40.580\nThat had a record function and I put like the boom box on the table and press record was it was very civil with you?\n\n38:40.580 --> 38:44.580\nYeah, at that one\n\n38:44.980 --> 38:48.980\nAnd so that was the beginning of it and then but that was like there were no podcasts\n\n38:48.980 --> 38:55.140\nThere was no way to know what anyone thought about anything and in my head. I'm like, I wish I could talk\n\n38:55.540 --> 38:57.540\nTo Harold Ramis and ask\n\n38:57.620 --> 39:02.580\nBut it was still a it's still an archetype that kind of transcends technology because now that kid would have a podcast\n\n39:02.660 --> 39:07.220\nBut it is there is a there's an archetype there. Yeah, like the kid the precocious kid who's like\n\n39:07.220 --> 39:11.220\nI'm like, please sir. I'm just interested in your funny comedy and the and the the\n\n39:12.500 --> 39:16.980\nPeople getting a kick out of like well, I'd be a pretty good person for uh being on this\n\n39:17.540 --> 39:22.500\nThis kid's show and treating him like an equal and I just proved I'm a great guy\n\n39:22.580 --> 39:29.140\nLike I've I've done that for a certain podcast of like do you do you never I people ask me to do it\n\n39:29.140 --> 39:31.140\nI know never do it\n\n39:31.300 --> 39:33.460\nThe kids like you did it. I'm just like fuck off\n\n39:33.460 --> 39:40.180\nI don't know I don't know so they bet the like the kind of baptismal moment is ben stiller doing what he also did for me in\n\n39:40.180 --> 39:42.180\nSchrab and what he's done for\n\n39:42.740 --> 39:47.460\nSo many that it's kind of crazy that if he wasn't also ben stiller and therefore\n\n39:48.100 --> 39:53.380\nInteresting in different ways it would be a naturally very interesting thing about him that he that he's that he\n\n39:54.260 --> 40:02.020\nSees like yeah, he's just like this frog tongue goes and just grabs the juiciest fly. That's a horrible way of putting it\n\n40:02.020 --> 40:07.060\nWhy do you have to take something wonderful about a guy that I owe everything to and purposely\n\n40:07.380 --> 40:09.380\nTurned it into the most grotesque thing I could\n\n40:09.780 --> 40:17.060\nEverything you know why is because I started to realize I was flattering myself because I oh my my benefactor has great taste\n\n40:18.260 --> 40:21.940\nSo I I I hit like an ear breaker. I was like no make it gross and dumb\n\n40:22.420 --> 40:27.780\nWell back then, you know, it was different because comedy wasn't as big so like stiller\n\n40:27.780 --> 40:32.580\nI think he was on four or five episodes of Saturday Night Live. He was like a writer performer\n\n40:32.740 --> 40:36.900\nThey kind of didn't let him on the show how he got on the show is a crazy story\n\n40:36.900 --> 40:41.860\nWhich is he made a short film which is a parody of the movie a color of the color of money\n\n40:42.100 --> 40:46.020\nWhich is about pool. Yeah, he did a version with John Mahoney, which was bowling\n\n40:46.260 --> 40:49.220\nYeah, and he played Tom Cruise and John Mahoney played\n\n40:49.860 --> 40:52.580\nPaul Newell. He was a really good impressionist like he really did\n\n40:52.580 --> 40:58.020\nWell, Tom Cruise was insane. Yeah, no one did Tom Cruise. No one was doing a Tom Cruise impression\n\n40:58.580 --> 41:01.220\nI mean back then people were still doing like Jimmy Cagney and stuff\n\n41:03.220 --> 41:05.220\nSpiro Acneu\n\n41:05.380 --> 41:09.620\nAnd so so he makes this film he waits in the lobby at NBC\n\n41:10.580 --> 41:15.380\nAnd he sees John Lovett's and he hands it to him and says will you show someone at Saturday Night Live?\n\n41:16.020 --> 41:19.460\nAnd he did and then they said we're gonna put it on this weekend\n\n41:19.460 --> 41:22.900\nAnd people loved it and then he got asked to be on the show, but when he was on the show\n\n41:22.900 --> 41:27.220\nHe was like I want to make short films. No one there wanted him to make short films\n\n41:27.620 --> 41:31.700\nso he left like he quit Saturday Night Live like in six weeks and\n\n41:32.260 --> 41:36.020\nHe did a show for MTV and then that didn't go but had some great\n\n41:36.740 --> 41:39.700\nLike a u2 parody that was pretty incredible. It was really good\n\n41:40.020 --> 41:43.460\nAnd and then I met him online at Elvis Costello unplugged\n\n41:44.100 --> 41:46.420\nI was with Dana Gould and he had met Ben\n\n41:46.420 --> 41:51.380\nAnd we both knew HBO was looking to produce the sketch show and then\n\n41:52.100 --> 41:56.340\nBen and I met we thought of an idea and we sold it like two weeks later\n\n41:56.660 --> 41:58.660\nAnd we had known each other for two weeks\n\n41:59.380 --> 42:01.940\nWhen the show got sold like everyone thought we were pals\n\n42:02.660 --> 42:06.260\nBut we literally just met but he didn't know that I didn't know how to do anything\n\n42:07.540 --> 42:09.540\nAnd it was was he did he\n\n42:11.300 --> 42:15.140\nHe got you that EP credit right like he he probably like fought for you and\n\n42:15.140 --> 42:17.140\nI might have had better credits than him\n\n42:17.380 --> 42:21.060\nOh, okay. Well, if you're doing you're doing all those specials that's that's the chapter that I know\n\n42:21.140 --> 42:23.460\nIt was a mistake because HBO wanted a sketch show\n\n42:23.860 --> 42:31.140\nAnd then we pitched it for HBO and HBO started a production company and they sold it to be the so they were the producers\n\n42:31.380 --> 42:36.900\nSo it would air on fox. So so fox had no vetting process of like these are children\n\n42:38.180 --> 42:41.140\nThey shouldn't have a network show and suddenly I'm the executive producer\n\n42:41.140 --> 42:48.100\nFrom like just writing jokes, but this is like after like Christopher guests like stuff like they would they would do their little shorts on\n\n42:48.340 --> 42:50.340\nOn snl, right? Yes. So\n\n42:51.300 --> 42:54.500\nThat was already kind of a thing. Yeah, but then that became\n\n42:55.380 --> 43:00.420\nLike that was is that where mr. Show kind of was like it's like it's like the protoplasmic mr. Show\n\n43:00.740 --> 43:07.460\nOdin Kirk and cross were on it Garofalo Andy Dick our friend Dino Stamatopoulos was was on it and uh\n\n43:08.260 --> 43:09.780\nand\n\n43:09.780 --> 43:11.780\nRob Cohen\n\n43:11.780 --> 43:15.460\nAnd uh, but it was all done with uh, like it\n\n43:16.180 --> 43:19.940\nYou know, we were so naive. We didn't know that there was a thing called casting\n\n43:21.300 --> 43:25.300\nSo when they said who's like in the show like who's your your troop\n\n43:26.180 --> 43:28.740\nBen and I just sat down in like five minutes just went\n\n43:29.380 --> 43:31.380\nWell bob and andy are funny\n\n43:31.940 --> 43:33.780\nAnd janine's funny\n\n43:33.780 --> 43:35.460\nAll right\n\n43:35.460 --> 43:40.020\nAnd but we didn't know that in town was jack black and will ferrell and all these people\n\n43:40.340 --> 43:44.020\nWe just thought well, who's the funniest people in our group that we love\n\n43:44.500 --> 43:48.420\nAnd you hear that janine you you would have been replaced with jack black\n\n43:50.100 --> 43:52.100\nHe just didn't know he could\n\n43:52.420 --> 43:57.700\nBut I was like ben would have an instinct like you know, who's hilarious bob and then back then we were like, okay\n\n43:58.020 --> 44:00.020\nLike we didn't it wasn't like a corporate\n\n44:00.020 --> 44:07.300\nProcess to it. It was like how old how old are you in that first kickoff 24? What? Yeah, that's crazy\n\n44:07.380 --> 44:09.380\nHey, I was pretty young\n\n44:12.020 --> 44:14.020\nWhen I\n\n44:14.100 --> 44:15.460\nuh\n\n44:15.460 --> 44:17.940\nBlogged Dan you're you're 58\n\n44:19.300 --> 44:20.980\nI\n\n44:20.980 --> 44:25.540\nIt's like Ben's we have we refer to this thing called the fraud complex out here\n\n44:25.540 --> 44:32.740\nIt's it's it's something that I learned early on like I I uh, I was dating uh, you probably know\n\n44:33.060 --> 44:38.980\nTracy katsky. I was like I was she was like my first la girlfriend. I think like um\n\n44:39.860 --> 44:41.860\nI remember coveching about something\n\n44:42.180 --> 44:48.660\nAt probably that age and she also taught you the word convention. Probably yeah, but but but she uh\n\n44:49.140 --> 44:54.980\nThat she's like was it like I'm just you know drama queen like like about this and that she's like fraud complex\n\n44:54.980 --> 44:56.420\nYou have a fraud complex\n\n44:56.420 --> 44:58.420\nAnd it runs the industry\n\n44:58.420 --> 45:02.340\nBut but I think ben stiller's fraud complex runs more industry\n\n45:03.140 --> 45:08.580\nIt's it's like his his ben ben's fraud complex and I hope he wouldn't be offended by that because it's like it's a complex\n\n45:08.580 --> 45:15.300\nIt doesn't mean he's a front. He's more than proven that but he's he he was he was born with these parents that\n\n45:16.020 --> 45:21.860\nYou know where they were the the rest of us have these stories about being in our pajamas and running out at the parties and being like\n\n45:21.940 --> 45:23.940\nOh, and here's this little sociopath\n\n45:23.940 --> 45:31.060\nUm, let's all pay attention to them the funniest guy in the midwest and ben stiller is the son of these\n\n45:31.780 --> 45:38.900\nLegendary hilarious amazing party animal comedy people who are never going to be out shown no matter what his pajamas look like\n\n45:39.460 --> 45:42.740\nAnd and and I think and I think that we owe that\n\n45:43.620 --> 45:48.020\nWe owe everything to that but like we owe better calls all to that we owe everything\n\n45:48.020 --> 45:54.820\nIt's like like the the the chart of what ben stiller being so unsatisfied being so unable to just go\n\n45:55.060 --> 45:57.060\nYeah nailed it\n\n45:57.060 --> 46:00.420\nThat made him quit snl before he like drowned in it\n\n46:00.500 --> 46:06.020\nIt made him like do 13 episodes to show with you that won an emmy after I got cancelled\n\n46:06.740 --> 46:09.780\nIt made it makes him it made him at least at that time like\n\n46:10.580 --> 46:14.740\nHe he he just always is like oh that person's funny or who do you say is funny?\n\n46:14.740 --> 46:18.900\nLike if I hear someone's funny, I just go well fuck that person. I'll figure out why later\n\n46:20.340 --> 46:23.620\nBut and then maybe over time I'll go Dan. What are you doing? Calm down go to therapy\n\n46:24.180 --> 46:25.620\nMaybe someone's funny\n\n46:25.620 --> 46:29.220\nBut but I feel like ben would hear someone's funny you'd go. Oh really?\n\n46:30.020 --> 46:32.980\nHow how funny can I can I meet them like I can I help them?\n\n46:33.220 --> 46:36.820\nWell, it was for ben. I'd watch it. It was like falling in love\n\n46:37.380 --> 46:44.020\nLike we saw Owen Wilson when we were casting the cable guy and you could just see it was like a comedy falling in love\n\n46:44.020 --> 46:50.180\nYou know we saw a little piece of bottle rocket and we just lost our mind like this is going to be the greatest thing ever\n\n46:50.420 --> 46:52.420\nWe thought the movie would make $200\n\n46:53.860 --> 46:55.860\nand and\n\n46:56.100 --> 46:58.340\nAnd then that happened with jack black and with a bunch of people\n\n46:59.060 --> 47:02.820\nOver the years with that. Yes. So when you started off by saying I\n\n47:03.460 --> 47:06.580\nOur version of casting is just picking the four people that we know\n\n47:07.300 --> 47:10.260\nNow that you get the pick of the litter like how does that work for you now?\n\n47:10.820 --> 47:12.820\nHow does it work now?\n\n47:12.820 --> 47:17.140\nWell, you know, you know sometimes I have a lot of energy for casting when we did freaks and geeks\n\n47:17.540 --> 47:19.940\nWe said, well, let's get real kids. It'll work better with real kids\n\n47:19.940 --> 47:23.540\nSo me and paul and jcass and we would do open calls and no one does this\n\n47:23.620 --> 47:27.780\nWe just go we're at a school at noon in vancouver\n\n47:28.260 --> 47:30.260\nAnyone can come read for us\n\n47:30.740 --> 47:36.180\nAnd a thousand people would show up and we did that in chicago and new york and some other places\n\n47:36.500 --> 47:40.020\nAnd and we found people that way and then other projects\n\n47:40.020 --> 47:47.220\nYou're just tired and you just realize fine. I'm not going to look at that many people but this one seems seems good\n\n47:47.460 --> 47:54.020\nIt doesn't feel great. Do you give yourself credit for when you look at freaks and geeks and the fact that that was in terms of the\n\n47:54.260 --> 47:58.420\nLestot factor the patient zero that you became patient negative one\n\n47:59.060 --> 48:01.060\nThat are you are you do you?\n\n48:01.300 --> 48:08.020\nDo you acknowledge that do you feel proud of that that that every single person in freaks and geeks went on to become an entire\n\n48:08.020 --> 48:13.060\nYou know cottage industry and that that actually doesn't usually happen and that that means that you\n\n48:14.020 --> 48:17.780\nPicked up that Ben Stiller habit. Yeah. I mean, it's so weird\n\n48:18.500 --> 48:22.980\nNow when you really look at it and how deep into the show and there's a whole nother level at the show\n\n48:22.980 --> 48:26.100\nWe're like Shia LaBeouf was on the show. I saw these other people\n\n48:26.820 --> 48:29.460\nYou know, we were discovering people that we didn't even\n\n48:30.580 --> 48:32.580\nWhatever, I'm not gonna finish that\n\n48:34.020 --> 48:35.700\nYou know, but it uh\n\n48:35.700 --> 48:40.500\nI always thought I was who was great. You know, it's a very weird thing. You know, when you open it up to\n\n48:41.380 --> 48:44.980\nWe're just gonna hire great kids. We're not gonna go. I need a blonde for this\n\n48:45.060 --> 48:49.860\nI need a tall guy with this attitude just who of every kid that you could show us is great\n\n48:50.420 --> 48:55.620\nAnd we will rewrite Paul will rewrite the script to tailor it to these people\n\n48:56.580 --> 48:58.740\nYou can find amazing people\n\n48:58.740 --> 49:04.340\nBut also I felt terrible about the fact that I knew the show was gonna get cancelled and all these kids had like\n\n49:04.340 --> 49:06.340\nforegone college\n\n49:07.380 --> 49:09.380\nI really you know, that was the time where there was a\n\n49:10.100 --> 49:12.100\nWay more young stars robbing\n\n49:12.580 --> 49:19.220\nliquor stars and things and I thought I need to not allow that to happen my Jewish co-dependency kicked in\n\n49:19.860 --> 49:21.940\nAnd and so and I knew they were all great\n\n49:21.940 --> 49:26.580\nSo I wanted to keep the team together, but I was also afraid for their their lives\n\n49:26.820 --> 49:32.180\nYeah, they don't do that anymore like they don't write they I guess they slide over to youtube and get robbed\n\n49:32.180 --> 49:40.020\nBut like google, which should they survive which of you two think it's gonna play the other one and the movie about\n\n49:40.100 --> 49:42.100\nthe other person\n\n49:42.820 --> 49:44.820\nWhat's more likely\n\n49:45.220 --> 49:47.780\nUh, yeah, I answer my question\n\n49:49.620 --> 49:56.100\nIt's just I mean, I'll facilitate this in any way I can I'll I'll I'll I'll play a Judd in a movie\n\n49:56.740 --> 49:58.740\nThat's a little darker more of the\n\n49:58.820 --> 50:00.340\nYou were in funny people\n\n50:00.340 --> 50:03.300\nThat's right. A lot of people don't know you started my acting career\n\n50:03.780 --> 50:08.660\nYou and kyle kahane. Yeah. Yeah, kyle kahane and I I said I said I\n\n50:09.380 --> 50:14.500\nYou were saying like oh these paparazzi guys are obnoxious and they say these terrible things and I was like really they say like\n\n50:15.220 --> 50:17.220\nlike really and and and I\n\n50:17.540 --> 50:20.340\nI can't remember if it was in the cut or if it's just like in my memory\n\n50:20.420 --> 50:25.380\nIt was like I felt I felt really bad because I I said to adam sandler's character\n\n50:25.460 --> 50:28.100\nIs it was it aids or cancer and then he he went\n\n50:28.100 --> 50:35.220\nLike like and I it felt and I saw this I felt like it was like oh fuck. I'm one of those extras that\n\n50:35.860 --> 50:41.380\nYou pushed it. You pushed it. That he was like Jesus fucking Christ. Can I work or are you are you done being funny?\n\n50:41.380 --> 50:46.420\nYou fucking get a paparazzi number two. You know, I was like it was like I think the final joke we wound up with or\n\n50:46.820 --> 50:50.980\nWas just that you it's a saying like is it true that you're gonna be in the ghost busters reboot\n\n50:51.700 --> 50:56.100\nIs that that must have been kyle probably uh, that's that's that's that sounds very smart and uh\n\n50:56.100 --> 51:03.940\nUm, uh, yeah, well, so so but it's it's so so freaks and geeks and then that precedes\n\n51:04.500 --> 51:10.660\nUh, uh, larry sanders show right like that's no that's after larry sanders. Oh shit. Okay, so now we gotta\n\n51:10.740 --> 51:12.740\nI explain all of this in my masterclass\n\n51:14.740 --> 51:19.700\n$90 and you get five hours of this. I didn't I didn't know that you worked on larry sanders\n\n51:19.780 --> 51:21.860\nI I didn't know that you worked on larry sanders\n\n51:21.860 --> 51:26.420\nI worked on larry sanders and you know when we did freaks and geeks in my head the whole time. I would think\n\n51:26.980 --> 51:30.980\nUh, I would trick myself into thinking I was still at larry sanders\n\n51:31.620 --> 51:36.420\nAnd this is just a scene about some of their kids and I thought if I just write this\n\n51:36.980 --> 51:42.180\nThe way gary would approach sanders, right? It'll be right and they said that was like my little private\n\n51:42.260 --> 51:48.020\nWas sam simon over still around on that sam simon was on it's Garry Shandling show. Oh, so yeah, he wasn't on the other one\n\n51:48.020 --> 51:51.060\nYeah, they asked you something about larry sanders because I don't think I've ever\n\n51:51.940 --> 51:54.740\nI don't know who to talk to that's been on that you you knew had a hand in it\n\n51:56.180 --> 51:58.180\num, the the\n\n51:58.420 --> 52:03.140\nWhen I watch it like I think I did like a rewatch of it a couple years ago and uh\n\n52:04.100 --> 52:06.660\nwhat it looks to me like\n\n52:07.220 --> 52:08.740\nit\n\n52:08.740 --> 52:14.820\nWell, you guys were developing it that the idea would have been that it would have been this kind of noises off hybrid\n\n52:14.820 --> 52:22.100\nThat it was going to be very the there was a formula there that we were going to be rooted in the talk show and that it was going to be\n\n52:22.660 --> 52:28.420\nUm stories were going to threaten to derail the show as we told it and then it clearly evolved into a thing\n\n52:28.420 --> 52:32.900\nOr like we definitely didn't care if we ever saw what was happening on stage that that was just like a weird\n\n52:33.700 --> 52:35.700\nMill that that that sometimes\n\n52:35.780 --> 52:42.100\nCollapsed or and and drove everything is that so in that like like you just described like like was that an evolution?\n\n52:42.100 --> 52:46.660\nAm I accurate? Uh, I think that gary. I think gary said he was had\n\n52:47.780 --> 52:52.420\nUh, the tonight show and he was hosting and there was some sort of problem with little richard\n\n52:54.100 --> 52:59.540\nThat little richard was mad about something and he was watching a producer trying to like calm down little richard\n\n52:59.940 --> 53:05.140\nAnd I think that he realized like there's a there's a whole emotional world behind this show\n\n53:05.460 --> 53:08.500\nWhich has to do with you know, you have this ego maniacal\n\n53:08.500 --> 53:12.020\nUh host that everyone is trying to figure out what he wants\n\n53:12.580 --> 53:16.180\nAnd there's a there's all these relationships between the the back\n\n53:16.660 --> 53:21.540\ncrew and that through the backstage of the talk show you could explore just the entire human\n\n53:22.100 --> 53:30.020\nCondition and I think gary was fascinated by his own problems with wanting to be successful and famous and like he hated\n\n53:30.500 --> 53:32.020\nhis own\n\n53:32.020 --> 53:34.020\nego maniacal\n\n53:34.020 --> 53:36.420\ntendencies and it really became a show\n\n53:36.420 --> 53:38.420\nabout\n\n53:38.660 --> 53:40.180\nIt was enough\n\n53:40.180 --> 53:46.500\nIt could have been a black box theater show that never that one of the sets you could have broken down the set of the talk show\n\n53:46.660 --> 53:51.220\nYeah, he kept using it, but it was like it was his office and it was the kitchenette\n\n53:51.220 --> 53:55.220\nIt was because it was like and it was it was just this crazy\n\n53:57.540 --> 54:00.740\nSelf-loathing like like weird spiraling\n\n54:01.460 --> 54:04.900\nPortrait of this god the kind of guy that's good at this job\n\n54:04.900 --> 54:07.460\nAnd there's nothing that will make him happy right, you know\n\n54:07.460 --> 54:09.460\nHe wants success at all costs\n\n54:10.020 --> 54:13.700\nTo the you know to the destruction of most of his relationships\n\n54:14.180 --> 54:19.380\nAnd it's just never works till finally he's pushed off his own show by the younger guy\n\n54:19.860 --> 54:23.540\nI'm just I'm yeah, I'm just here which was john steward if I get for you space kids\n\n54:23.700 --> 54:29.300\nYou little hologram kids. You don't know no larry sanders. You thought it was its Garry Shandling show. Oh, that's uh\n\n54:29.300 --> 54:34.260\nIt's uh streaming on each wheel also little richards was a black entertainer\n\n54:36.740 --> 54:42.020\nIt was an ironic name. He was a giant. Yeah, he was I'm certainly he was mad about lucille\n\n54:42.660 --> 54:44.660\nNot doing his sister's wheel\n\n54:45.300 --> 54:51.860\nBut but I just what I'm curious about is do you recall a point in some season of that show\n\n54:52.500 --> 54:56.420\nThe way that I because I think about rick and morty. Thank you. Um\n\n54:56.420 --> 54:58.420\nUm\n\n54:58.500 --> 55:02.180\nYou have daughters. I I I'm sure you're familiar. Uh, the the\n\n55:04.580 --> 55:08.020\nDid that did that sound that maybe because his kids are daughters\n\n55:08.580 --> 55:13.380\nWe'll certainly fix that one every every everyone with kids is that that's my in now\n\n55:13.460 --> 55:20.820\nI can be like like ilan musk has kids. So I've I've touched the fucking space man death. Stop it. Stop it\n\n55:22.660 --> 55:25.140\nStop touching stop touching children\n\n55:25.140 --> 55:28.660\nI've got a ilan musk story. All right. Well, okay\n\n55:29.380 --> 55:31.540\nI'm gonna tell it quick and interesting like weird\n\n55:32.180 --> 55:36.580\nOkay, so I just want to know is there was can we go into a segment called ilan musk stories?\n\n55:36.900 --> 55:38.900\nYes, we can in a second in a second\n\n55:39.540 --> 55:44.580\nThe the the current segment is I want to hear this like if there's an if there's a point that you remember where\n\n55:44.740 --> 55:49.380\nWhen you're doing larry sanders where this template that you decided on where you're like, you know\n\n55:49.380 --> 55:55.300\nWe had this whole idea of the show and was there a frustration or a breakdown or an epiphany where\n\n55:56.260 --> 56:00.340\nSomeone or some faction or some people said we don't even have to ever\n\n56:00.980 --> 56:04.420\nSee the talk show in order for this to be a good show. Yeah, I don't think that was the turn\n\n56:04.420 --> 56:07.380\nI think the turn was in the first year or two. He had a wife\n\n56:07.860 --> 56:13.620\nAnd and I think that gary was writing the wife. He wished he had so he had this like professional\n\n56:13.620 --> 56:22.020\nThe catherine harold's like smart woman and it was almost like what would a relationship look like if I was sainer\n\n56:22.500 --> 56:26.100\nand and and it never played the way that\n\n56:26.900 --> 56:31.700\nThat it needed to because that wasn't the kind of person that gary dated in real life\n\n56:32.900 --> 56:36.500\nAnd and so that we did have a conversation once about\n\n56:37.220 --> 56:39.220\nlarry should be single\n\n56:39.220 --> 56:44.180\nBecause I don't think this is truthful what you're trying to do with your wife\n\n56:44.260 --> 56:48.020\nAnd there was also an x-life character and there were some good episodes and they were great\n\n56:48.180 --> 56:53.780\nBut as soon as you made him date, I think that was the moment where it became more about his\n\n56:54.660 --> 56:59.700\nYou know his personal life and how frustrated he was and and then it became more more truthful\n\n56:59.860 --> 57:02.340\nI think yeah, I just when I think of that show\n\n57:02.340 --> 57:05.540\nI remember who just this is like him walking into work and already\n\n57:05.540 --> 57:10.740\nShielding him from everybody and him just like in his baseball cap and just in that voice\n\n57:10.820 --> 57:14.260\nI'm just like not being able to handle it and I can't handle it\n\n57:15.220 --> 57:18.020\nLike I like I actually at Eclipse\n\n57:18.100 --> 57:23.060\nI forgot that there was another part of that show that like did you ever remember the barney miller pilot?\n\n57:23.300 --> 57:25.300\nIf you watch the barney miller pilot, there was a lot of his wife\n\n57:25.780 --> 57:30.100\nIt was like you could tell the pitch was look cops have two lives\n\n57:30.340 --> 57:31.860\nThey got their work family\n\n57:31.860 --> 57:35.940\nAnd they got their home family because it's like how lindon's putting on his and he like loves his wife\n\n57:36.020 --> 57:40.340\nAnd then he goes to work with these this like crazy sweat hog group of like cops\n\n57:40.420 --> 57:46.260\nI'm like the show became a one act play on one set of these crazy cops like how lindon never had a wife again\n\n57:46.740 --> 57:48.740\nbut um, it it's it's it's\n\n57:49.460 --> 57:51.460\nIt the weird connection there is that\n\n57:52.260 --> 57:54.580\nThe dick van dyke show always struggled with that too\n\n57:54.820 --> 57:58.740\nWhich was the first thing Garry Shandling brought up in the one encounter I ever had with him\n\n57:58.740 --> 58:01.940\nWhich was right before we lost him and I haven't been able to watch your\n\n58:02.580 --> 58:06.180\nyour documentary on him because I just I it's it's it's\n\n58:09.220 --> 58:11.780\nI also haven't watched it land us and maybe it's for dumb reasons\n\n58:12.100 --> 58:15.380\nLike maybe it's because like I don't want to watch jet after I'll be friends with Garry Shandling\n\n58:17.380 --> 58:23.460\nBut but I also I'd like to credit myself and think like actually it's kind of heartbreaking because as a kid because he was this meta guy\n\n58:23.460 --> 58:30.500\nAnd and and I and sarah silverman bless her heart someone who was smart enough to recognize that I was\n\n58:30.740 --> 58:36.740\nShe couldn't work with me and yet still would invite me to her rooftop parties and you know, it's it's rare\n\n58:38.180 --> 58:41.540\nWell, you mean rare rare for a person not rare for her not for her\n\n58:41.700 --> 58:47.540\nBut for a person to uh, she cast old like yeah, she's she's just embrace that she's nice\n\n58:48.260 --> 58:50.260\nand and uh\n\n58:50.260 --> 58:56.580\nAnd she knew she's like you want to meet Garry Shandling and it was like it would be the last it was the last\n\n58:57.300 --> 59:03.060\nI was like, well, yeah, but I was like, you know, like dragging, you know, like it just just meet him\n\n59:03.860 --> 59:05.860\nGary, this is dianne harmon. You don't know him\n\n59:07.060 --> 59:11.860\nAnd it's just like like putting me at a zoo and like like it doesn't matter how this turns out for him\n\n59:11.940 --> 59:17.300\nAnd I say hi gary. I'm dianne harmon. I made a show called NBC game. You know, I've been recently fired from it\n\n59:17.300 --> 59:19.780\nOh, yeah, why why you get fired from it?\n\n59:20.100 --> 59:26.660\nUh, I think I mean I'd like to think is because it was uh, too too inside too meta. He's like, ah, geez\n\n59:26.740 --> 59:28.740\nAre they still giving that no\n\n59:29.780 --> 59:35.380\nAnd I was like I was like and then and then because I that's what I wanted to hear from him because his show time show\n\n59:36.180 --> 59:40.820\nNot to admit it's like he was always the guy where the painting was part of the frame\n\n59:40.900 --> 59:43.940\nBut he also loves that you're being real with him\n\n59:43.940 --> 59:47.060\nAnd and that you're you're showing him your pain\n\n59:47.700 --> 59:53.620\nAnd that's why he wanted to talk to you because he really couldn't handle the bullshit, right?\n\n59:53.620 --> 59:55.460\nBut if you walked up and go like\n\n59:55.460 --> 59:58.420\nI'm all fucked up right now. He's like, let's go. Let's let's get into it\n\n59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.100\nYeah, and he but and then he immediately went the rest was him talking about the dick van dyke show\n\n01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.420\nWhich I found so interesting because I never even realized\n\n01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:10.420\nDick van dyke show was meta. He worked on goddamn show. He worked on that show\n\n01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:16.740\nNo, no, no, he was saying like what is he fucking networks? Hey, like oh, it's uh inside baseball\n\n01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:22.580\nIt's about tv. So it's not tv fucking dick van dyke worked on my impression is fading\n\n01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.020\nI turned into Camille. I can't tolerate\n\n01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.700\nThat was that was the best Kumail Nanjiani impression\n\n01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.940\nBut it was and it was so great because it was like like like wow, this is like the what like\n\n01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:38.020\nLike he he'll never see my show, but I got to say\n\n01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:43.540\nUh, the network doesn't like it because they it's about it's about it's aware\n\n01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:47.300\nAnd he said like my shit's all aware. I'm like, yeah, why the fuck do you think I wanted to meet you?\n\n01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:50.580\nAnd then he's going dick van dyke was aware television is aware\n\n01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:54.180\nIt's supposed to be I got a little drunk. Sorry jet apatow. Well, that\n\n01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:58.980\nBut that you know when that's why I've been unable to watch your documentary because I\n\n01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.300\nIt's like it's like it I also if you did one about Harold Ramis\n\n01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:09.220\nI also would not be able to watch that because that was a celebrity death that that buckled my name\n\n01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.380\nWell, how do you think I felt having to like?\n\n01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:17.700\nWatch hundreds of hours of gary just talking, you know as a friend. You probably loved it. You ghoul\n\n01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.180\nElon Musk story\n\n01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.380\nWho's going first?\n\n01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.220\nWho's going first?\n\n01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.940\nLet's start with Dan Dan. You got the first Elon\n\n01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.700\nI I I don't know if he was trying to throw a party, but he throws terrible parties\n\n01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.820\nJet apatow you're up\n\n01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.340\nJet apatow Elon Musk story\n\n01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:54.740\nOkay, before he had the car and he was just like a mystery scientist guy\n\n01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:00.740\nUh, I was at an oscar party and and I was talking to him. I didn't really like know the significance of\n\n01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:05.940\nLet me just seem like a tall strange very smart man. And uh, and I'm a little drunk\n\n01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:09.380\nand I don't know he was in whatever space he lives in and uh\n\n01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.420\nJust the the regular space\n\n01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.700\nAnd I was it's where his car is\n\n01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.300\nAnd that's weird enough\n\n01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:23.300\nYou're not supposed to live in space. I was asking him what uh, you know what what he's working on and he said\n\n01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:29.140\nI'm I'm trying to uh invent a rocket ship that will go to mars\n\n01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.180\nAnd back and then I said to him\n\n01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.940\nThere's no way you'll figure that out before you're dead\n\n01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:52.260\nThat kind of reminds me of did you ever work with so I'm fucking Elon Musk one night\n\n01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:57.620\nAnd I mean, I'm fucking him\n\n01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:03.380\nDid you did you did you ever work with with with with sam simon\n\n01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:09.540\nI never worked with sam simon although I love love loved him. There's a there's a story of that jiff\n\n01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:15.860\nLike sam told jeff this story about himself meeting bill clinton, which is that oh, yes\n\n01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:23.700\nThat that he uh, you know sam sam and he like the simpsons and cheers and fad albert and fucking everything\n\n01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:28.340\nOh, yeah, he created everything. I didn't create me. He wrote on everything. Yeah, go ahead. Oh\n\n01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.980\nI mean\n\n01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.140\nNow you can tell it if you want\n\n01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:38.900\nI said that like I don't know where what the context was but sam was meeting bill clinton and who was\n\n01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.420\ncurrently the president like when he was meeting him and uh\n\n01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:48.820\nUh, and there was some fundraiser who knows what and then the president does his like whole line of things and he's shaking hands\n\n01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.940\nOkay, see fucking god damn it\n\n01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:58.820\nI I'm only gonna give you this it was a party that was at a house party in like belair bevelly hills\n\n01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:04.500\nAnd someone said I think the president's coming by and everyone's like no, he's fucking not and then\n\n01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:09.060\nAnd it wasn't sam's house. It was someone else. Yeah, it wasn't sam's house, but but then\n\n01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:11.780\nBill clinton shows up at a house party\n\n01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:15.940\nThere's so many people in this world that you can be at a belair party\n\n01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:22.100\nAnd be sam's simon and it and and be and hear that the president's coming by and it's not your house\n\n01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:26.100\nLike that's that's a lot of rich people\n\n01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.060\nSo now just take it from there because you'll have everything\n\n01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:33.620\nSo then the president comes by and he visits. I'm sure it's complicated when the president comes by\n\n01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.740\nYou could probably get shot for passing the mustard. I don't know they have to\n\n01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.180\nAnd I didn't think god I took square dancing if I remember that situation\n\n01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:45.620\nThere's a whole line. I just all I remember of it. It just comes down to a dialogue couplet\n\n01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:51.060\nIt's like bill bill clinton being introduced to sam sam sam sam was the\n\n01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.420\nHelp create the simpsons of oh, I love the simpsons\n\n01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.620\nWait wait was camille there too\n\n01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:05.060\nOh, oh andy andy.

So I know I need a little more time to\n\n01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.980\nThe psychic was good, but there was this psychic\n\n01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:24.260\nWe were talking to because we occasionally like a good psychic and uh, and this woman was just wrong about everything\n\n01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:29.540\nBut really confident, you know, you know, so she's like you're you're you're your wife or what?\n\n01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:37.620\nUh, well, we separately, but uh, the woman was it was like you you like the classic cars. You like the classic cars like\n\n01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:41.540\nYou know\n\n01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:47.540\nYou know your your your mom's not doing well. She's she's got the Alzheimer's and like no, she's dead already\n\n01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:54.180\nYeah, yeah, yeah, like but she also took big swings at like really terrible things happening\n\n01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.580\nYou know like she doesn't you were in Katrina\n\n01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.180\nYeah\n\n01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.180\nYeah, there's no way to even turn that into\n\n01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.500\nWhat a storm you've you've seen your share of storms\n\n01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:10.740\nBut she did say to she was you're depressed, right, right? You thought about killing yourself, right?\n\n01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:16.020\nFor real swings for real. Oh, yeah\n\n01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:23.540\nWhich you that's a fucking it's like a home run hitter if there was a psychic movie equivalent of slap shot or happy gilmore\n\n01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:28.820\nSo they like fuck it like like there's a and there's a prude antagonist\n\n01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.820\nPsychic centrist who's like you can't read fortunes like that\n\n01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:37.700\nHey, fuck it. You you you fucked Paul Bunyan. No, I didn't well\n\n01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.580\nYou're gonna whoo\n\n01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:42.580\nIt's in the way that she used\n\n01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:48.020\nSo was she was she caused that she was wrong on everything\n\n01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.500\nEvery single thing uh, she was wrong\n\n01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:54.580\nAlthough I but I felt bad because I felt like she looked in my eyes and just thought like, you know\n\n01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.380\nI think that those people mainly just look at you and if you're in a good mood\n\n01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:00.740\nThey kind of say things that support that and if you're in a bad mood\n\n01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:05.300\nThey're like you you're having a hard time, aren't you and like I gave off the terrible vibe\n\n01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:11.700\nThat she just thought my life was trouble. She couldn't know who you were. She didn't she wasn't a big apatow fan\n\n01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:17.460\nBut I think she she didn't like if she knew you she would have been more like a little on point. Well, she was english\n\n01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.780\nShe was english\n\n01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:27.300\nShe that was that she was like this this is 40 isn't uh, isn't on cable yet. They're like, no it is well not here\n\n01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:34.900\nHave you been to the English did the English not not like dig your movies or what why in England do they dig them?\n\n01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:42.340\nUh, I don't know. I you know, I've gone places and it never seems to catch on in a big in a big way, you know\n\n01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.340\nWell, you are pretty anti-british in your uh\n\n01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:51.940\nYou know, we've worked with the Russell brands and the English people and it doesn't seem to\n\n01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:58.500\nExplode the whole thing. I only went to a psychic one time. I was on a road trip and I was like\n\n01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:05.780\nFun, you know go in the second. That's what everyone thinks. I no one thinks I'm severe. I'll go in a second\n\n01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:10.740\nThey went out, but I thought it would be an occult experience. I didn't know it'd be\n\n01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:16.420\nUh, it's like they they they she laid out some I think she did some tarot cards or maybe it was palm\n\n01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:21.940\nHistory, I can't but but because what I remember is she was like well you're you want to do this\n\n01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:27.700\nBut you want to do that it was it was actually the opposite of what you're describing like no like tiny little weed wacker swings\n\n01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:32.820\nThat couldn't help but be accurate. It's like you're you're you're conflicted about something related to your life\n\n01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.980\nLike you're good\n\n01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:40.740\nIt and it was like, you know and the part of you that\n\n01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:46.180\nWent in paid money is like that's the smarter move because you actually are engaging in a self\n\n01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:50.900\nInventory that could be beneficial. It could be a form of therapy, but then at the end of it\n\n01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:57.620\nIt's like it just turned into like this is like, you know, and you know, you've turned your back on christ and he just needs to\n\n01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:03.780\nAnd it's just everything got christian and I'm like wait, how do you know that's been our show? Yes. Thanks for coming\n\n01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.140\nHow do you know I'm not muslim and aren't you a witch?\n\n01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:13.380\nHow are you even on this team? What do you even when I was like 10 years old?\n\n01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:15.700\nI got my palm read and the woman looks at my hands. She goes\n\n01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:21.620\nWhen you're in your late 40s, you're gonna have an injury to your right ear. I'm like give me give me this\n\n01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.860\nhand back\n\n01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.660\nThere's this there's no way there's that many lines\n\n01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.540\nJust it's fucking impossible\n\n01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:36.900\nLike we went to a psychic and the psychic implied like we were about to go on vacation Hawaii and she was like\n\n01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:41.140\nI'm seeing. Uh, I don't know. I'm seeing some windy roads\n\n01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:50.100\nLike she was probably we're gonna die on the vacation and so we went to Hawaii and like hid in the room for 10 days\n\n01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:57.140\nUntil you realize it's an island every road is supposed to be windy the dangerous roads would be straight\n\n01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:02.820\nWe got scared, but we proved her. I don't know if we proved her correct or not correct because we didn't die\n\n01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:08.740\nYeah, well, yeah, we also I think the same woman like I like two months later read my hand. He goes you're gonna live\n\n01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:13.540\nForever. Whoa. I'm like, whoa, but what about my fucking ear?\n\n01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:21.220\nIt's like you're sore or something you're gonna live forever, but you're gonna your brother's gonna take your ear\n\n01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.900\nHe's a giant ox. Yeah, also\n\n01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:26.580\nSo I've been told I'm gonna have three children. I think that ship has sailed\n\n01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:30.340\nSo like everything was a lie. No one's like nothing's ever been\n\n01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:36.100\nAccurate about that. Are you what it's up? Let's respect our guests and give them a what a what time? Oh, look at that\n\n01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.340\nSee, I fucking nail. I'm so good at this show\n\n01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.020\nAll right, what are you plugging?\n\n01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:50.340\nI thought we were I thought we were talking about when is enough enough. Oh, yeah, but look\n\n01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:54.580\nHey, Jen, can we talk about you being the host on chop jr. For the next year seasons?\n\n01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:59.940\nYeah, I know. Well, do you have fantasies of retirement? Do you have plans? Uh, well\n\n01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:03.940\nThis is dan asking about whether or not he's allowed to retire. Yeah\n\n01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:08.100\nDo you do you think about in retiring? Like do you think uh, like why do you still do it?\n\n01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.860\nbecause\n\n01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:17.140\nIt's it's always been for the money and I hate everyone and they've always hated me and I arrived alone\n\n01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:21.460\nAnd I'm leaving likewise and and and they've been hurtful and they're gonna miss me when I'm gone\n\n01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:32.100\nAnd I and and to prove it I just test drove a tesla yesterday on sunday\n\n01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:34.420\nDan, sorry. Did you have to cut you off for a second?\n\n01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.020\nHold your father. Dan, you're never gonna fucking retire because your your\n\n01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:44.260\nIdentity is based on your output. Like you you want to be\n\n01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:50.820\nLiked and and to be in the mix like you what you're gonna fuck tell them Judd. Tell them\n\n01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:55.220\nNo, Dan, you tell me you really how much money have you made?\n\n01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:00.020\nWell, I can am I allowed to count the\n\n01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:04.740\nMoney am I gonna make? Yeah, okay, like hundreds of millions\n\n01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:10.100\nIf you can't count it, but you haven't Judd\n\n01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:16.260\nJudd, ten dollars. Are you like are you like Judd? What's his name Ryan Murphy? Are you uh, you have a Ryan Murphy deal?\n\n01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.900\nI yes\n\n01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:25.380\nProbably Judd, you and I have just met I I can guarantee you having known Dan for a long long long time\n\n01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:30.980\nHe's never going to retire because his identity is too built into the work\n\n01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:37.460\nHe you you want to create and you want people to like the things that you judge. Do you think based on your storyteller?\n\n01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:42.420\nUh, is this the character in the movie that is the good friend or the\n\n01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:48.740\nIs this the drinking buddy that doesn't want you to get married or\n\n01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.460\ndid like\n\n01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:56.340\nIf you went off the air Dan if you went off the air and didn't have a tv show didn't have a movie coming out\n\n01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:58.420\nDidn't have a podcast. I moved to Montana\n\n01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:04.020\nYeah, you'd be happy just moving to the hills and completely switching off\n\n01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:09.460\nI wouldn't take it that extreme. I mean like Larry Sanders in that in that season like he's a very resonant thing\n\n01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.940\nHe has this fantasy. It's like I'm going to go to a cabin in Montana\n\n01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.660\nIt just becomes this mantra and then like the season ends with\n\n01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.340\nlike\n\n01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.180\nLike there's the cabin. He's in Montana. It's just like it's quiet. He's like\n\n01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:29.860\nBut I wouldn't I don't I don't make the mistake of thinking that I don't love attention and that I don't need to feel\n\n01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:35.620\nThe admiration of strangers and all this stuff. Well, I I simply like I\n\n01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:38.980\nI'm pretty confident that I mean it when I say\n\n01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:45.220\nI would love to wake up one morning and ask myself the question. What do I want to do?\n\n01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:49.700\nBecause you're burdened. I have to there's too much to do\n\n01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:55.700\nTo get all the work done. Yeah, and I think I got not have a deadline not have a couple little dumb movies\n\n01:17:55.700 --> 01:18:00.820\nLike the kind that that that got you your start and the kind that go Schrab, and I did channel 101\n\n01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:04.500\nIt was like these are the happiest times of our lives when we were in our 20s\n\n01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:08.740\nAnd we made these like dumb things and yeah, you make them now you put them on instagram\n\n01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:14.260\nAnd you just like 40 Nazis go stop talking about politics. I don't I don't but who cares about them\n\n01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.260\nIt's not for them. I just want to watch them burn\n\n01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:24.660\nIt's it's it's like it's like the fulfillment like I'll make a little song and I'll go like that feels nice\n\n01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:27.940\nI think that's the expression on my dad's face when he works on stained glass\n\n01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:32.500\nHe's like my dad doesn't go. I can't stand not working on vhs duplication anymore\n\n01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:40.100\nMy dad doesn't have to be good or bad or lying or honest in order to be like I prefer working on stained glass\n\n01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:42.980\nHe's really bad at it. Like I hope my dad\n\n01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:49.060\nHe makes terrible stained glass. Is he a fan of the show? Should we not talk about that? I don't I don't think so\n\n01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:52.100\nI think because I think in the 300 episodes of this show\n\n01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:58.820\nI think even just as an aggregate we probably provided tutelage in making stained glass better than he's made\n\n01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.220\non accident\n\n01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:03.220\nOkay. Well, all right\n\n01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:07.460\nIt's the reason you groaned is because the joke was poorly constructed\n\n01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:10.580\nIt's not because it was like a low blow\n\n01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:15.380\nYou're groaning because you're like all of that for that just to say your dad's shitty\n\n01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:22.260\nJudd, how about you? Are you going to be the kind of person that wants to retire soon or work to you? They put you in the dirt\n\n01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:26.500\nNo, I just uh, sometimes I think the things that uh\n\n01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:33.140\nAre smaller are less pressure and more fun. Like it was really uh enjoyable to\n\n01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.020\nYou know work on the documentary\n\n01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:40.260\nI made a documentary about the avid brothers and about daniel strober and white gooden\n\n01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:43.940\nAnd I find that I'm getting more and more joy out of the things I don't get paid for\n\n01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:46.340\nHave you been able to find some place where you don't?\n\n01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:51.380\nLike your what is your relationship with people's opinion of you?\n\n01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:57.540\nYeah, like like like like so because how do you because I'm only to the place where I can go\n\n01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:03.220\nOh, fuck them. That's the healthiest I can get. Yeah, but even the ones who like you\n\n01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:05.780\nNo, no, no not fuck them. No\n\n01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:12.980\nA thousand camels for that for their children. I I I no I just mean like like it's it's it's like oh\n\n01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:17.060\nUh, that relationship can hurt me. Yeah, so fuck it\n\n01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:23.700\nYeah, but you you're about to tell me how to get a relationship where you're like, actually it's okay for them to say\n\n01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:30.420\nFuck you. Judd Apatow. You straight white fucking privileged pieces. Shit. It's never fucking, but I fuck you and you\n\n01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:34.580\nHacky bullshit. Oh, it's a would you're on every billboard because you're a piece of shit\n\n01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:40.500\nFuck you and like and that and that you're you're able to go like hey Judd you're allowed to leave whenever you are\n\n01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:47.380\nYeah, but like you you but you feel there's like there's like a debate on the work that's happening that there's some people love it\n\n01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.540\nAnd there's some people who yeah\n\n01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:52.020\nEngaging with you and attacking you for different\n\n01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:57.540\nThere's not even a debate on the work like, uh, maybe this is like like like it's like, oh the work's great\n\n01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:03.300\nIs it ever going to make this guy a good person? Yeah, why do you think you're a bad person? I'm a bad person\n\n01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.940\nYeah, but why are you a bad person?\n\n01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.900\nwell, ironically, uh\n\n01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:14.420\nA lot of it should happen. I just called you a bad person. I want that to go on record\n\n01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:18.660\nI would like to think ironically it's because well, I had work to do\n\n01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.420\nYou had work to do and that made you a bad person. Yeah, I did what my work wasn't in the area of\n\n01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.340\nBeing a good person\n\n01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:31.140\nThat you were focusing on your own ego and your own success\n\n01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:36.660\nAnd not helping anybody if somebody came up and said like hey, can you help me open this soda? I'd be like\n\n01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:38.740\nuh\n\n01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:41.380\nHow is that going to make television good? Yeah\n\n01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:46.820\nSo they go we're eight and I'm like well, bitch you better fucking figure it out\n\n01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:52.020\nYeah, because I'm going to be controlling tv one day and you're going to be open in sodas. Yeah\n\n01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:57.940\nAnd as you compound that for 40 years, but it's like is there a difference between our breed?\n\n01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.780\nAre you are you and are you a you're a you're a you're a\n\n01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:04.420\nMore likable person, right? Like you're\n\n01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:10.580\nLike I think this crowd likes you more than me. So you're wrong. They're self abusive\n\n01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:15.540\nSo yes, you're right. They do but they because they've they they conflate\n\n01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:22.260\nLoathing with authenticity and so then they're like, I like them because he hates himself. That gives me a break from hating myself\n\n01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:24.900\nIt's terrible. We're all unhealthy. I see\n\n01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:31.060\nThat's true. But that's why we have guests like you to invite us upward and so I think we're all asking you\n\n01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:34.500\nDo you have a secret? Can we escape this?\n\n01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:38.980\nWell, I used to be I think I used to have a lot more of your energy\n\n01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:44.900\nEarly in my career because I remember I was working on the bedsteller show and they gave me all these terrible notes\n\n01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:50.180\nAnd I said to the guy I said, uh, well, I'm not doing any of them. What happens now?\n\n01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.460\nYeah\n\n01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.860\nAnd then we got cancelled\n\n01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:00.420\nUh, and I did this and you won an Emmy\n\n01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:03.220\nAnd then I did the same thing on a freezer geek. So we got cancelled\n\n01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:07.380\nI did the same thing on undeclared. We got cancelled and then I made this pilot with the great Dave Herman\n\n01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:12.580\nyou know from office space and king of the hill and he had a beard he played a pearl officer and\n\n01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:16.260\nThe the head of the network said, uh, I want you to reshoot\n\n01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:18.260\nWe were three days into shooting the pilot\n\n01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:24.740\nI I want you to reshoot everything because I don't like the beard because only uh villains and pirates have beers\n\n01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:29.940\nAnd so then the head of the production company came to me and said you can you do this?\n\n01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.300\nWill you reshoot everything you've done?\n\n01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:34.020\nBut we have been like improvising for three days like you couldn't really\n\n01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:38.980\nRecreate what had happened and he looked better with the beard as a kind of a grizzled guy\n\n01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:42.100\nAnd I said I don't think I can do it\n\n01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:47.620\nLike I don't think that it will be better without the beard and she said if you don't shave the beard\n\n01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:51.860\nThere's no chance this show will get picked up\n\n01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:54.580\nI'm like really like she will hold that against me\n\n01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:57.220\nUh, like she begged me to make a show\n\n01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:01.220\nBut she will hold it against me and not pick it up only because of the beard. She said yes\n\n01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:05.620\nAnd I'm like, well, I'm not shaving the beard and uh, and then they didn't pick up the show\n\n01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.460\nSo I have had Dan Harmon years\n\n01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.580\nLike keep going. I was like wait\n\n01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:16.180\nWas there a dead man's curve or you're like, I can't do it\n\n01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:19.380\nThere was there wasn't that man's curve\n\n01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.980\nWhich is I was working on the 40-year-old virgin and uh, I was like again\n\n01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:26.820\nI was like three days in we had only shot two things we shot\n\n01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:31.300\nHe was like remember where there was like a bus that had all this like sexy signs on it\n\n01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:35.300\nAnd he was just running away from this bus with with a perfume ad on the side\n\n01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:39.620\nAnd um, so we shot that and then we shot this speed dating sequence\n\n01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:43.460\nYou know and the studio saw it and then someone from the studio\n\n01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:48.260\nYou know in the middle of the day called and said shut the movie down\n\n01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:52.020\nAnd they said, you know, Steve looks like a serial killer\n\n01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:55.380\nAnd Paul Rudd looks fat\n\n01:24:55.780 --> 01:25:01.300\nAnd you're lighting it like an indie, but it also felt like they didn't really understand the the style\n\n01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.860\ncomedically of what we were doing\n\n01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:10.340\nAnd that was usually the moment where I would like, you know burn everything down and and we wouldn't start up again\n\n01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:14.420\nAnd for the first time in my career, I went, okay, I'm gonna listen\n\n01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:18.420\nTo everything they say because someone said to me when you\n\n01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:21.220\nWould you tell people their notes are stupid\n\n01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:26.100\nYou're basically calling them stupid and then they make it their mission to destroy you\n\n01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:30.100\nBut that's their reaction. This is all in the masterclass by the way\n\n01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:36.340\nAnd and uh, and so I said don't just don't do it just listen to the notes\n\n01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:42.500\nJust don't maybe there's a way to do the notes and so she's like well he looks like a serial killer and I said well\n\n01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:47.060\nHe's wearing like a tan like Jeffrey Dahmer jacket all the time\n\n01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:50.500\nAnd I said, well, we probably could make that maybe like a running gag that everyone tells him\n\n01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:55.620\nHe's looking like a serial killer. That's good. I like that and and then we did that and it became a big part of the story\n\n01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:57.620\nHang a lantern on it. We call that\n\n01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:58.980\nYeah\n\n01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:02.660\nI mean don't address the note you make the note part of the script\n\n01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:08.580\nI actually made up a comedy term that no one uses which is a certain joke is a turd in a slipper\n\n01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:14.340\nA slipper a turd in a slipper which basically means like you like you put your foot in a\n\n01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.300\nIn a slipper with a turd in it and it's a joke that feels good, but it's not right\n\n01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.940\nIf this episode is not called turd in a slipper I quit\n\n01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:31.940\nI\n\n01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:37.700\nBut then I couldn't I couldn't make Paul run skinnier because I wanted run to be to be fat\n\n01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:42.020\nYou know like I thought you know, he was always so cute and like clueless and I was always like\n\n01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:45.460\nI like him like when he looks like he's falling apart and\n\n01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:53.060\nAnd so I said i'm gonna make paul lose weight, but it was too late, you know, you wanted you wanted to poop in his slipper\n\n01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:59.060\nAnd then uh, you know the lighting is the lighting and then I realized like oh, this didn't even make sense\n\n01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:04.980\nShutting us down like she could have just called and said hey keep an eye on these three things\n\n01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:10.340\nThat happens a lot where like an email will come in and it's like\n\n01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:19.700\nTheir choice to make it seem catastrophic and so their language is catastrophic and so you inherit that and then you go\n\n01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:23.540\nWell, then defiance is the only I'm just beating that horse\n\n01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:26.580\nBut it's like that that is why it's worth like breathing and going\n\n01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:30.740\nWhat's the note behind the note? How do you actually do this? Like let them be hysterical\n\n01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:36.180\nAnd I go like actually this is this is as most notes is addressable\n\n01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.300\nYeah\n\n01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:40.900\nAnd the way to be defiant is to prove that that serves your ego\n\n01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:45.300\nIt go like actually you guys think it's hard to make him not look like a serial killer\n\n01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.460\nAll you had to say is please\n\n01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:52.580\nYeah, and and you like you can retain your ego and you're but it's so hard because when they give you the notes\n\n01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.820\nWhat you're thinking is\n\n01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:57.940\nAnd it's because it's because that's linked to\n\n01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:01.220\nThe presupposition\n\n01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:08.580\nThat you didn't you don't know what you're doing. Yes. It has to be because if you really knew when you really have confidence, isn't your\n\n01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:14.740\nIt's like actually dumb shit saying like are you sure this should be a thing? Yeah\n\n01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:20.980\nLike isn't it kind of like I was like do you want us to engage in the humiliating ritual of changing it for you?\n\n01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:26.420\nLike you're kind of like you have that like power that Harry Potter scar in your head\n\n01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:32.180\nI think for me it was I like for me the reason why I'm also that confident. It's no I'm not I\n\n01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:35.780\nBut but I just realized I don't know if maybe\n\n01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.740\nWas that moment did that coincide with you?\n\n01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:44.580\nA relationship that you're in your personal life a daughter born or a\n\n01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:50.020\nA wife married that you're like I gotta stop making bridges out of firewood\n\n01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:52.340\nWell, I you know, I had a I had a realization\n\n01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:59.780\nUh, which is okay anything something anytime something would happen like with the show or even a scene or anything going wrong\n\n01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:05.780\nI would just lose my shit and my wife would always make fun of me and and just you know\n\n01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:10.020\nJust be like oh nightmare on the set nightmare on the set like mock me\n\n01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.900\nYou know meltdown on the set. What will you do?\n\n01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:20.020\nAnd and she just so laughed at me for the fact that I would go to 10 on things that weren't that important\n\n01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:24.340\nAnd and I made a connection at one point. I was in this giant fight\n\n01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:30.420\nI wanted to direct uh this the pilot that with Dave Herman. I couldn't get them to let me direct it\n\n01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:37.140\nThey they said no and I was just losing my shit and I realized that I was treating the head of the network\n\n01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:39.940\nlike my mother\n\n01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:45.620\nAnd that I was uh looking to there were two heads of the network at fox\n\n01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:50.900\nI think they were like my mom and dad getting divorced and that I had the energy\n\n01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.460\nOf like a 14 year old\n\n01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:57.540\nFucking flipping out with them and I'm like this isn't what's happening\n\n01:29:57.860 --> 01:29:59.860\nI have different energy than what's actually\n\n01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:04.420\nGoing wrong here and as soon as I realized I was treating the head of the network like my mother\n\n01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:07.700\nI I made a choice to find people\n\n01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:15.620\nWho understood what I do and that I wouldn't be in fights if I really spent more time going what executive gets\n\n01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:18.980\nThe joke right and ever since I've done that\n\n01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:25.140\nIt's all easier, but you have to if the really I remember met larry galebart and larry galebart wrote the movie\n\n01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:32.660\nuh neighbors the one with john belushi and uh dan acrid and he said he went out to dinner with the director and\n\n01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:35.380\nThe director wasn't funny\n\n01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:40.420\nBut he didn't do anything about it. He was just like he wasn't funny and then like two weeks into shooting\n\n01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:45.940\nHe's like this is a disaster and he said he realized like at that moment. I got a pulpo plug on the whole thing\n\n01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.940\nI have to make sure our neighbors\n\n01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:53.060\nYeah, these are the right people like if I don't if I don't have the right team around me\n\n01:30:53.460 --> 01:31:00.500\nThe whole thing is screwed and so that's what I tried to do is slow down and go who really understands me, but but\n\n01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:06.500\nBut an argument could be made that that that guy that melts down that that's what he's trying to do\n\n01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:12.420\nHe's he's trying to make the he's going this isn't right. You're not right.

I gotta do a good job\n\n01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:13.140\nI'm gonna really hurt her long-term prospects and I think about it\n\n01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:20.660\nBut it's worse when I work with my kids because I just think I'm gonna make my children a laughing stock around the world\n\n01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:26.500\nAlso, there's wardrobe people the makeup department and all these like grips and carpenters and all this stuff\n\n01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.820\nI was I was kind of happy about one aspect of the rosean thing\n\n01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:35.300\nWhich was that actually for the first time in mainstream media talking about the television industry\n\n01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:39.060\nThere was a big talking point that was 200 people lost their jobs\n\n01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:44.100\nYeah, and and and I'm not saying. Oh, that was a great talking point or as bad\n\n01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:51.940\nIt's like we'd never really talk about that and also it's not always true every day that sony came to a table read on community\n\n01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:58.580\nTheir theme was actually you're fucking 200 people over with your shitty late\n\n01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:02.660\nCrazy Dungeons & Dragons scripts. That's why I kept saying to them\n\n01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:10.100\nYou know, you can always fire me and all these guys that saw wood and haul cable be as safe in your fucking loving arms as you want\n\n01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:17.540\nIt kind of like it sometimes that fraud complex goes. I'm actually I need to get out of here to save\n\n01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:22.500\npeople hauling cable, but do you think I know this sounds weird, but\n\n01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:25.780\nEveryone in show business is in the circus\n\n01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:32.980\nSo if this isn't like people have been working at Ford for 25 years and the show goes down and they never get a job again\n\n01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:35.620\nThey all just jump on another fucking Hulu show\n\n01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:41.220\nYeah, I mean like it sucks, but you might have three or four bad months\n\n01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:44.820\nThat's if they're lucky, but I think that a lot of people is like\n\n01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:48.020\nLike when somebody like when Kevin Spacey\n\n01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:53.300\ngets Kevin Spacey and the house of house of cards just dies\n\n01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.300\nThere's some\n\n01:34:55.620 --> 01:35:02.900\nProbably 150 people that said oh fuck. I just got hired like I thought I had a no it definitely sucks\n\n01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:06.100\nI mean it definitely sucks. It's it's awful\n\n01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:12.260\nBut you know only shows are like eight episodes or 10 episodes and there's so much demand\n\n01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:16.980\nFor crews for shows that like the the biggest part of it\n\n01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:21.620\nI mean you know who gets screwed is like certain actors or actresses they can only work on that show\n\n01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:28.020\nYou know there are certain people on rosanne. You go. This is where they're gonna score in this show\n\n01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:35.140\nYou know, I guess my question wasn't so much about the like the the grand picture of laury met calf being out of a job\n\n01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:41.140\nIt's it's the fact that like when you're writing an episode fighting with the network fighting with the studio\n\n01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:44.100\nHaving your own little like tug of war\n\n01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:47.700\nHow much do you think about the fact that you're\n\n01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:53.540\nThat you're in charge of a lot of people. Well, I only think about it in the sense that there's a big crew\n\n01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:57.860\nAnd I and this sounds like bullshit, but I really think I you know\n\n01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:01.380\nI'd like this all to work well for them so that they all feel respected\n\n01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:06.820\nIf anything goes gets weird they can come to me and it will be dealt with and that like we're like a happy\n\n01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:11.620\nFamily that's not a big burden on you as you're doing the creative. It's not hard to do. It's it's not hard\n\n01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:17.780\nTo be pleasant and right nice to the people who work for you like the people who who are a nightmare\n\n01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:21.620\nIt requires more energy. How much time like like how many\n\n01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:28.420\nsets crews like shows have you been on where it was a fucking nightmare because like I've been very lucky\n\n01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:34.340\nTo work in comedy where everybody's nice. Yeah, and only maybe one or two times people were shitty\n\n01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:38.820\nBut that's like really rare like yeah, I haven't had a lot of those experiences\n\n01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:43.460\nI think a director can be shitty and be yelling at the crew and yelling at the dolly grip\n\n01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:48.100\nThat they they miss the mark like you do see that like somebody who is so obsessed with doing a good job\n\n01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:54.020\nThey're mean to people around them, but I think everyone has bad days where they do that\n\n01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:59.380\nAre you do you think you're good at cultivating like an environment of happiness and fun and grievous?\n\n01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:01.380\nI'm the least fun person on the set\n\n01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:07.620\nI'm not fun. I you know like like I don't know how you are like, you know when you're working on episodes and you're on set\n\n01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:13.860\nI am so nervous that the day is not going well that my main thought is\n\n01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:18.020\nI need to figure out a way to seem like I'm in an okay mood\n\n01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:22.100\nFor everyone around me because what's in my head is uh, so\n\n01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:24.340\nBut that's good. You like I find myself\n\n01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:30.340\nI I get so easily fixated on what they're doing that and then I over time over a couple of seasons\n\n01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:34.980\nI I objectively noticed because I love being in the edit bay and\n\n01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:36.980\nuh, I\n\n01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:42.740\nAnd I love being in the writer's room and then I would sometimes go to the set where they're shooting the things that you wrote in the writer's room\n\n01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:47.860\nThat you labor over and then that you're gonna have to edit and what I would notice is that me on the set\n\n01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:51.140\nwas like you you might as well throw a\n\n01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:54.260\nBucket of chicken bones in the air and\n\n01:37:54.820 --> 01:38:01.220\nAnd adjust the set the way the chicken bones implied because because it was basically like it's like\n\n01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:06.420\nLike yeah, sometimes the chicken bones are gonna be right sometimes raw. I was like like outside of like any but it's like\n\n01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:08.420\nI'm not my instincts for\n\n01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:11.620\nFor actors and how to communicate with them like\n\n01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:16.500\nYeah, might as well roll the dice. Well, I agree with Ed to a point\n\n01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:18.820\nI I\n\n01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:22.420\nYou know when the show's going well, you know, we're shooting crashing right now. We have great directors\n\n01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:24.660\nI don't feel like when I sit on the set\n\n01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:26.820\nUh, it's essential\n\n01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:30.500\nTo what's happening and you know, I'm always thrilled when an episode comes in and it's\n\n01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:37.220\nIt's incredible and I can go I was not there for one second. Yeah, I felt that funny people like I had that\n\n01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:39.540\nYou know, and I was like\n\n01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:45.540\nJudd's Judd's got his ass plopped in this director's chair. It's like we're burning money here. He could be off developing something\n\n01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:47.700\nI got this\n\n01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:51.300\nUh, but but but yeah, I is that the only time you've worked at the Anish Kaminsky\n\n01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.540\nUh\n\n01:38:53.540 --> 01:39:02.020\nWait, I don't know what that's a cinematographer who did the funny people.

He ended up sitting in hawaii happily married\n\n01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.140\nAs opposed to like, whoa fucking\n\n01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:10.500\nWow\n\n01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:15.940\nWhich is what the but but like so far so good. Yeah, you're doing all right. Yeah\n\n01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:23.860\nYou started like scrapping and wanting and you've been transparent about it. Like there's\n\n01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:29.620\n190 people in here some of them are surely bad people some of them are good people\n\n01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:32.260\nUh, a lot of them\n\n01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:35.060\nYou guys are all good people\n\n01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:43.620\nIs there is there is there any way to like like like like after all of these decades of you with these these roller coasters like\n\n01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:47.300\nIt's dumb. It's like that's what they always want. What's your advice to young people?\n\n01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:52.100\nWell, what is it, you know\n\n01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:55.220\nYou know, what is the advice to young people?\n\n01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:59.540\nIt could take the form of like a more practical way of asking it because it might get a more sincere answer\n\n01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:03.060\nIs what do you wish what do you wish you could poke your head through a doctor strange hole and say\n\n01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:06.420\nWhat's your advice to Dan Harmon so he's not so freaked out right now?\n\n01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:11.140\nNo, what do you wish you could say to yourself pick an age? I mean if you want to pick 17\n\n01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:14.500\nWell, I think you know the one thing that I got out of uh\n\n01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:17.540\nbeing around gary was\n\n01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:23.460\nBecause I never thought about any of the things that he talked about before meeting him in terms of you right from a\n\n01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:27.460\nPersonal place you're trying to learn who you are through your creativity\n\n01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.180\nYou know, he was a guy who didn't uh\n\n01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:34.820\nHe wasn't really part of the system like he made these shows, but he didn't seem like he was uh\n\n01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:39.460\nA part of show business, you know, like he just did his things on the side\n\n01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:45.780\nAnd he was almost like an independent filmmaker in doing his tv shows and I think there's a lot to be said for\n\n01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:47.620\nuh\n\n01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:50.980\ncaring that passionately about whatever you're doing and\n\n01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:56.100\nBeing willing to dig deep and then if you have something to say people might connect with it\n\n01:41:56.100 --> 01:42:00.260\nYou can't really succeed if you're just trying to be a cog in the machine\n\n01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:06.340\nYou're really trying to figure out what you want to express to other people and I you know\n\n01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:11.140\nFor me in a very simple way.
