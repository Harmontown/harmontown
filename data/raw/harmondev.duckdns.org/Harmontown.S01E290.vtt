WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Welcome to the Hayworth Theatre in the Dumbledore Tapestry, whatever the fuck this place is called.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
In the prestigious heroin district of downtown Los Angeles.

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
We welcome you once again, and it's always my absolute joy to say the words Harmontown is now in session.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Thank you.

00:22.000 --> 00:35.000
Everybody reach over and put your right hand in the lap of the person next to you and just rub it around.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Except for church.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Then give it both hands.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Let's bring out our Game Master Spencer Crittenden everybody.

00:43.000 --> 00:53.000
And once in a while a mayor is required.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Let's give it up for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Thank you.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Harmon.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Thank you.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Thank you.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Gratitude.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Grat.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I'm thankful for that.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Thank you.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Alright.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
That was it?

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Yes sometimes you know remember Six Degrees of Separation,

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
the Donald Sutherland monologue about how great art is about knowing when to take the drawing away from the child.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
People look at a Jackson Pollock and they go,

01:35.000 --> 01:40.260
I could do that you could you could start to do it, but you'd keep doing it until you fucked it up

01:41.600 --> 01:43.600
Pollock got drunk fell asleep

01:45.020 --> 01:47.020
Genius

01:47.020 --> 01:54.780
So you're feeling less pollocky or more a pollocky about that rap feeling like on point about my Pollock curation in terms of myself

01:54.780 --> 01:58.700
I was like gratitude rap, and then I'm like fuck it. I'm not sure

01:58.700 --> 02:05.440
I'm not sure how comfortable I am as Comptroller of how it's thin and well-shaven and

02:05.960 --> 02:07.960
Your haircut like you're looking

02:08.600 --> 02:11.360
You're looking like the sexy version of Dan Harmon

02:14.600 --> 02:16.120
Thanks guys

02:16.120 --> 02:18.120
Well, I mean look I

02:18.360 --> 02:24.040
The paradox is I was gonna be that like all handsome people. I don't care about looks anymore

02:25.680 --> 02:27.680
I'm over it

02:27.680 --> 02:30.600
How many abs do you think that you currently have?

02:33.480 --> 02:37.440
You know, I think I have two standard abs

02:39.440 --> 02:47.480
That are dripping over my belt and then another two backup retro abs that are actually my breasts

02:48.920 --> 02:55.080
I'm working on working on reducing them into maybe a more of an abdominal muscle

02:55.080 --> 03:02.200
I don't I haven't I haven't I haven't changed my diet, which I do want to say to you know my

03:02.920 --> 03:04.080
tribe

03:04.080 --> 03:06.080
guys that look like me

03:06.960 --> 03:11.720
Probably maybe so so risk of offending so you Russell Crowe

03:14.200 --> 03:19.760
You know, I'm sure I lead a sedentary pack of quote-unquote alphas

03:19.760 --> 03:28.720
The quotes are theirs. We're meta alphas. We're very self-loathing those quotes actually count as abs

03:32.760 --> 03:35.760
Fingers rippling we have purple tunnel from the air quotes

03:36.680 --> 03:38.680
When we flatter ourselves

03:38.960 --> 03:40.960
You could we could hang from a doorway

03:42.360 --> 03:47.240
By our air quotes nothing is sincere all is ironic

03:47.240 --> 03:49.240
but we're fat and

03:50.240 --> 03:55.480
And I would just say to those guys that I'm not I'm not mistaking myself for a fitness guru

03:55.480 --> 04:00.680
But I will say we always think diet and exercise and like

04:01.200 --> 04:06.000
Diet seems like the easier thing because it's like oh, I don't eat a cheeseburger

04:06.000 --> 04:11.880
That's easier than do doing a sit-up and I will say from I don't want to give bad advice

04:11.880 --> 04:17.200
We're all dealt different genetic cards and stuff, but I so far don't tell Dave Kline

04:17.200 --> 04:22.440
I said this my trainer slash fan that I met at the drawing room and

04:26.120 --> 04:28.120
Is he here

04:28.640 --> 04:30.640
There was a clenal Ganger

04:32.920 --> 04:38.200
Double-double-cliner double-cliner double-cliner. We'll we'll we'll funny that up and post yeah

04:38.200 --> 04:42.840
Yeah, was this this is only the West Coast broadcast if you're listening we we clean it up by the East Coast

04:42.840 --> 04:44.840
We've removed deniro

04:45.400 --> 04:47.400
We had to be funny or three hours ago

04:49.840 --> 04:55.320
But I was just gonna say just if you're curious if you're like me and you're like well

04:55.320 --> 04:59.320
I definitely don't want to do two things. I don't want to exercise. I don't want to diet

05:00.400 --> 05:01.800
So I

05:01.800 --> 05:03.960
Like I will say from my experience

05:03.960 --> 05:09.080
It turns out even though this wouldn't seem this way the exercise is the easier thing because if you do it

05:09.080 --> 05:13.400
You can still eat like shit like I'm still eating like shit

05:13.400 --> 05:18.080
Like I was just in New York, and I was just like inhaling. I just like you know the blackout drunk

05:18.080 --> 05:22.320
I looked at the photo roll. I'm like why why did the police keep not arresting me?

05:22.320 --> 05:24.320
Why are they taking pictures?

05:24.560 --> 05:29.880
And who are these people this that guy's pissed and no this guy seemed nice, but it's like oh, that's urine and

05:29.880 --> 05:34.720
Like like like maybe I found a video of me peeing just somewhere in the darkness

05:35.480 --> 05:40.400
What does this have to do with your diet Dan? Well, guess what? I didn't stop at the

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Albertsons and get kale on the way home

05:43.000 --> 05:49.400
I I followed Fred Flintstone vapor trails of Bronto burger cookouts

05:49.400 --> 05:54.040
and just wandered into people's living rooms and ate turkey off of their table and

05:55.680 --> 05:59.280
And so if you do that in 20 minutes on an elliptical a day

05:59.280 --> 06:03.560
You can you can you'll probably die of like bad things, but you

06:03.920 --> 06:08.080
You might you'll lose more tummy than if you what am I doing harm and stop I

06:08.760 --> 06:14.040
Just thought it was an interesting fact because I never knew I never knew it would work that way

06:14.840 --> 06:21.120
Never tried exercising before in my life. I really have it. It was that was called gym class. That was where we were

06:21.720 --> 06:23.720
cold from the herd

06:23.720 --> 06:30.840
Like the rope and the and the pull-ups and the the even the square dancing

06:30.840 --> 06:32.840
I don't know if that was a bone. They were throwing us

06:34.000 --> 06:40.200
Do you think that was maybe it was it was the square dancing thing like give the people that can't throw a ball a break

06:41.320 --> 06:47.240
Let them touch a girl before they become serial killers or or was it?

06:47.240 --> 06:55.520
Fuck these guys that can't throw a ball and are still gonna sail through the fiat system. I want to prove their monsters

06:55.760 --> 06:57.760
Make them touch girls

06:57.760 --> 07:03.360
And I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna bust them was there actually a square dancing in Milwaukee or oh, yeah

07:03.520 --> 07:09.880
For real that wasn't part of everybody. Well, yeah, this is a generational thing too who had square dancing by applause in there

07:09.880 --> 07:16.640
Did you did you go to some no school for the sexually confidence or something?

07:18.440 --> 07:23.360
Everyone had a suit and all the kids we did we called it cattillion

07:24.800 --> 07:28.680
Cattillion and everybody was always looked like a ventriloquist act

07:30.200 --> 07:34.320
The guys had to look like Louis Jordan and the women had to look like Audrey Hepburn

07:34.320 --> 07:36.560
And then you there was a woman that had like

07:36.560 --> 07:43.520
Our castanets and she would teach us like how to do like the Roomba and the Samba and

07:44.040 --> 07:50.440
Like the merengue and shit like that like this is when's it's gonna come in handy it turns out it did well, yeah, I mean

07:51.160 --> 07:55.640
Yeah, you can you can you can indirectly bully people in a podcast

07:58.360 --> 08:03.000
Learn the Samba so it wasn't choices that made you superior

08:03.560 --> 08:05.560
No, no, it was your breeding

08:05.560 --> 08:12.280
It was being raised in Orange County like they made you be fancy privilege

08:13.840 --> 08:16.720
Well, you want to talk about privilege? I do

08:18.080 --> 08:20.080
It profits me every time

08:21.320 --> 08:23.320
Can we talk about you?

08:24.280 --> 08:26.280
Hating being in first-class

08:26.920 --> 08:29.440
in airports because your tweets against

08:30.160 --> 08:32.000
the Mint

08:32.000 --> 08:33.360
JetBlue

08:33.360 --> 08:35.640
I gave you a very not a JetBlue lounge

08:36.320 --> 08:38.720
That was a lounge in the JetBlue terminal

08:39.720 --> 08:44.080
That you need it but they were very nice about it, but you were you're like this is fucked up

08:44.480 --> 08:48.320
I'm I'm I'm up in a lounge like a piece of shit and

08:49.360 --> 08:52.480
You you're talking shit about being in a first-class lounge

08:52.480 --> 08:56.680
I put a positive spin on it too. A lot of people said it was the it was the best stuff

08:56.680 --> 08:58.680
They'd read in a long time. I

08:58.680 --> 09:05.400
Think I got a lot of compliments on that. I really did and it made me proud. I do like people telling me

09:05.400 --> 09:07.400
I enjoyed your tweets

09:07.400 --> 09:12.720
You know, I did like it. You know, I will say thank you sometimes. I won't just

09:13.680 --> 09:16.320
Start getting in a tussle with the 17 year old

09:17.160 --> 09:23.200
Dressed in a baggy suit disguise with a friggin ink mustache. She drew on his face

09:23.800 --> 09:25.880
You're a bad writer kid. Come on

09:25.880 --> 09:28.800
I'm not I'm not great, but I'm

09:30.080 --> 09:35.060
Like you can't even say in a tweet that I'm a bad writer without writing badly. I know that you don't know

09:36.560 --> 09:41.200
You do like adding all these syllables to sound like Frasier like I come on

09:42.520 --> 09:45.160
Is it somebody that works with JetBlue or just a regular person?

09:46.040 --> 09:49.720
No, this is I felt bad. Yeah JetBlue tweeted and said that's not our lounge

09:49.720 --> 09:51.720
And

09:56.760 --> 10:02.280
You were very contrite about it. You were very because I love JetBlue. They only fly back and forth from New York to LA

10:02.280 --> 10:07.680
Right. That's all it is. It's like if the further rare if I I'm sure I don't know if people fly JetBlue coach

10:07.680 --> 10:10.160
And if you hate you bad experiences in JetBlue coach, I don't know. I

10:11.000 --> 10:14.320
Well, but I do want to say this. I do I realize this on the plane

10:14.880 --> 10:17.520
You know, we prepared it with my army the

10:17.520 --> 10:19.080
the

10:19.080 --> 10:26.560
Everybody buckle your admire belts a lot of oligarchs. Yeah, I'll say it. I'm an oligarch. I

10:27.840 --> 10:29.840
Haven't looked it up yet, but

10:30.400 --> 10:32.400
It sounds appropriate

10:34.320 --> 10:36.320
They will undercut our

10:36.960 --> 10:43.820
Own position with our politics or I'm sorry. We'll refuse to I'm a hero for I forgot why I was admirable

10:43.820 --> 10:52.940
I'll I I don't care if my feeling about how things should work happens to point to me having to give up some some stuff

10:53.100 --> 10:56.260
For example, I realized on that plane

10:56.860 --> 10:58.860
Having had to do it

10:58.940 --> 11:06.020
But also having been allowed to do it, which I shouldn't have that first-class people should not be allowed to shit in coach

11:08.100 --> 11:12.980
Okay, it says it you should if you're in first-class and the captain's taken a shit

11:12.980 --> 11:16.700
The coach can't come up and take a shit in first-class you get yelled at

11:16.700 --> 11:22.660
They can actually they can if the curtain is halfway unbuttoned that means you're allowed from from coach

11:23.700 --> 11:27.460
To go up in the first and take a little take a little first-class poop

11:28.100 --> 11:35.220
If the if the if the curtain is halfway undone that means like the captain is like like oh, no

11:35.260 --> 11:40.300
It's when the the food is going down the curtain is loose the captain's in the caboose

11:40.300 --> 11:43.740
He's dropping a deuce

11:45.340 --> 11:47.340
But I couldn't

11:47.620 --> 11:51.180
If the flight attendants are bringing the food cart down the aisle

11:51.620 --> 11:54.660
Nobody can go back down to the aft lavatory

11:54.780 --> 12:00.780
So Europe you are by law by the FFH to go up and take a first-class poop

12:01.580 --> 12:06.040
If yeah, if you're being blocked by the food carts

12:06.040 --> 12:12.800
Okay, well, maybe I don't feel so because I've been in I've been on planes so vast

12:13.720 --> 12:21.720
So how vast where they I think like that scene from inception was shot on there where like

12:22.200 --> 12:24.200
you know where it turns out

12:24.480 --> 12:30.840
Most of the movie takes place on one level in that weird plane where there's like a cafe and there's like a bunch of briefcases with

12:31.600 --> 12:33.800
hose hose wheels in them

12:33.800 --> 12:35.800
I was something like playing

12:35.800 --> 12:42.200
Plane I never saw the movie so I have no idea what you're talking about or are you seeing it now without knowing it?

12:43.440 --> 12:48.920
The trick isn't to get to see it to get you to see it. The trick is to convince you you've seen it

12:48.920 --> 12:51.960
I'm taking a poop in the lobby right now and nobody knows that

12:53.640 --> 13:00.060
I've just I've been yelled at for being in first-class and taking a poop in like platinum class

13:00.060 --> 13:05.540
I like I had a guy thought I got up took a poop watch did what I always do walked forward

13:05.940 --> 13:10.660
10 feet and took a poop and then as I was coming out a

13:12.420 --> 13:18.740
Fucking dude followed me back to my seat an employee of the airline legally going in a little uniform

13:19.380 --> 13:23.340
Like like which meant he was waiting for me to finish pooping and

13:23.340 --> 13:31.540
And then he followed me. It's like excuse me, sir. You're not supposed to use the bathroom in there

13:31.540 --> 13:34.980
And I was like, well, you were sitting in class. He said that's platinum class

13:35.740 --> 13:41.540
And I said well, it was you know, it's a blue collar poop. So it doesn't really matter. I

13:42.380 --> 13:44.380
Didn't say that I'm a coward

13:45.220 --> 13:51.820
All right, wait, there was there's a platinum blue collar poop area, but you you didn't use I somehow passed it

13:51.820 --> 13:56.380
I guess like there was like a Hogwarts like like pillar and a train station that you could

13:57.260 --> 14:03.260
That it's it's just like disguised more. It's like more worked into the the churn the coffee pot

14:03.260 --> 14:06.260
And then there's like a bathroom. I just passed it

14:06.260 --> 14:08.060
I just because I'm used to the geography of it

14:08.060 --> 14:12.060
I'm like the bathroom is gonna be as far as you can walk and then you hang a yo, right and

14:12.060 --> 14:22.860
And then you do your thing and that but I didn't know that like for stockbrokers. We're like Did that

14:23.260 --> 14:25.260
Millionaire just put his

14:25.620 --> 14:27.620
ass

14:28.060 --> 14:31.060
On our billionaire toilet and

14:32.100 --> 14:35.540
Fill it with whatever fucking high quality

14:36.340 --> 14:37.780
vegan

14:37.780 --> 14:42.780
Bakery that he didn't even have to eat

14:42.780 --> 14:49.020
Did I say I wasn't San Francisco and I was flying back to LA first class and I had the

14:49.780 --> 14:54.060
San Francisco Giants had just won the World Series while we were in the airport

14:54.140 --> 14:59.020
So everybody bought everybody a frenet bronca and a like anger steam

14:59.140 --> 15:04.580
So I had 90 drinks and I got on the plane sat down and go oh shit

15:04.580 --> 15:09.620
I I have to barf. I have to barf. Have we talked about this before I think you mentioned it

15:09.620 --> 15:12.020
Yeah, and I went back and people over my shoes

15:12.020 --> 15:18.060
But I didn't do it in the fucking front one because that's where the people that fly the goddamn thing are gonna have to be

15:18.300 --> 15:20.300
So I went in the back and I was

15:21.300 --> 15:24.260
Persona non grata. I was I was I was a bad guy

15:24.820 --> 15:31.380
Because it took me 30 minutes to clean up after what I fucking I was lucky that I had a little stealth bomber back this time

15:31.380 --> 15:35.940
Coach as we all know for you know, everyone's gonna look at me anyway, even if it's not my poop

15:35.940 --> 15:39.300
They'll all look at me, but I luckily I just do just like

15:40.100 --> 15:46.980
Yeah, I'm I'm six foot. I'm six foot four almost and I'm like tall and the back

15:47.460 --> 15:53.820
Laboratories are very short and I couldn't get down close enough to the thing to to like

15:54.220 --> 15:58.180
Successfully puking. Yeah, I don't know how you would so I just basically just lean my head over

15:58.180 --> 16:00.180
And

16:00.420 --> 16:07.500
Vomited a gallon of fernette bronca and acres to him all over the whole building and then people

16:08.580 --> 16:10.060
Hey, whoa, what's up?

16:10.060 --> 16:16.900
Like I mean knew that I was fucking from front like first class. I was like, yeah, you don't want to you don't you don't want to be in

16:16.900 --> 16:21.780
Here right now. Yeah, hey Spencer. How's it going over there? Hey guys chef Kevin here

16:21.780 --> 16:27.700
I like it without the without the blank. I thought it was I thought it was funny with the blanket, but the desk

16:28.260 --> 16:30.260
It's very

16:31.060 --> 16:34.180
Are your desk gonna get more and more elaborate?

16:34.980 --> 16:38.660
Yeah, as this show goes on I'm gonna keep adding drawers

16:40.980 --> 16:42.580
And the opening

16:42.580 --> 16:47.780
Are you just gonna be like the king's speech at some point and like write a whole thing

16:47.780 --> 16:53.700
I'm gonna be like the king's speech at some point. I hope you know that at the end of this mystery

16:53.700 --> 16:57.380
We're not gonna be surprised that you were the ghost. Yeah

16:58.580 --> 17:01.620
You're the only one that was here when our van broke down

17:03.140 --> 17:10.420
Obviously, you're here looking for the gold and using projectors and yeah, you're right that now no one is going to be surprised

17:10.420 --> 17:17.140
I'm the fancy guy. Why don't I have candles up here? Do you want some of my candles, man?

17:18.020 --> 17:19.700
No, I

17:19.700 --> 17:24.580
Don't want any of your candles. I want you to have all the candles. Thank you one more thing about jet blue

17:24.580 --> 17:26.580
And I want to bring on our guests

17:27.060 --> 17:31.300
Because I like them and I want to praise them like for their because all the people are always friendly and they're always look

17:31.300 --> 17:33.860
I'm biased and this doesn't make people good, but they're they see

17:33.860 --> 17:40.100
There's an overwhelming percentage of jet blue flight attendants that recognize me and say that they like my work

17:40.580 --> 17:41.700
and

17:41.700 --> 17:44.020
Sorry, but that makes you a good airline in my book and

17:45.620 --> 17:47.380
It

17:47.380 --> 17:51.460
And I I have that rapport then with them because I feel like well now they know

17:52.180 --> 17:58.020
They know they like me so now I can be gregarious and it's just fun and they do the thing where they put the

17:58.740 --> 18:00.260
the

18:00.260 --> 18:04.500
Cart in front of the thing because the the bathroom captain's got a thing

18:04.500 --> 18:09.140
And I I got up to use the bathroom and the flight attendants are lean on the thing and they look and they go

18:09.140 --> 18:13.940
Oh, and I go oh captain taking a deuce and uh, and they're like, yeah

18:15.940 --> 18:19.220
This feels more sincere and honest. They're like, it's okay. He can say it

18:19.700 --> 18:21.700
I bet if I was a welder they'd be like

18:22.420 --> 18:24.420
I think you mean he's shitting

18:24.420 --> 18:29.140
Oh, let's bring out our guest jet apatow

18:46.660 --> 18:48.980
Well, we'll never know how funny my bit was going to be

18:48.980 --> 18:54.980
Introducing jet apatow jet jet go back. We're gonna do a read we're gonna do a read

18:55.860 --> 18:57.860
All right, so then uh, yeah

18:58.340 --> 19:01.300
Jet blue, uh, it's not the best. It's not the worst

19:02.100 --> 19:07.940
But anyways enough about me. I'm tired of hearing myself talk, you know when I started this podcast. It was all about me

19:10.980 --> 19:13.700
But then I thought what about the voices we don't get to hear

19:13.700 --> 19:20.580
And I it was then that I've decided to start using my podcast as a signal boost

19:21.220 --> 19:23.220
For the unheard voices of America

19:24.100 --> 19:26.100
Please welcome jet apatow

19:37.380 --> 19:39.540
Thank you pretty funny intro

19:39.540 --> 19:41.540
So

19:41.940 --> 19:43.940
They went for it you'll edit out the first part

19:44.820 --> 19:46.820
We're gonna have to yeah, I guess

19:48.100 --> 19:50.420
Which you don't know is we're gonna do four more

19:50.980 --> 19:52.980
Interactions of this

19:53.540 --> 19:55.540
This is the whole time you're on stage

19:56.100 --> 20:02.340
This show is heavily edited, right? Yeah. Yeah. I panicked when you you arrived in the green room and you're like, so what's the plan?

20:02.580 --> 20:04.580
And I was like, uh, oh

20:06.260 --> 20:08.100
Uh-oh

20:08.100 --> 20:10.100
How come you get a stand

20:10.100 --> 20:14.660
For your microphone. Oh, yeah, where where where is Schrab's weird lectern that we have?

20:14.980 --> 20:16.980
What if my arms are tired?

20:18.020 --> 20:23.220
There's one we last that's a power move to have your own stand and deny it to your guests

20:25.700 --> 20:29.380
It's kind there's one over there, but it's actually I now that I now that I donated mine

20:29.940 --> 20:37.220
It's it's not only did I get to high road, but it's actually better not to have that's that thing is a do feel powerful

20:37.220 --> 20:39.220
I don't need it either. Let's go stand less. Yeah

20:46.740 --> 20:48.740
How many pianos are there

20:51.540 --> 20:56.900
Seems like a complicated way to hold a microphone and you know the real irony zero typewriters

20:59.380 --> 21:01.380
No, there's one typewriter

21:01.380 --> 21:05.140
Oh, wait, he's he's got a stand, too

21:14.580 --> 21:18.500
And we don't even want him he's right here the whole time and you move the piano

21:25.380 --> 21:27.380
Hate them hate stands

21:27.380 --> 21:33.940
I never realized how insulting they are like like oh, can I hold that for you? No, no

21:36.020 --> 21:39.540
Thank you for that was that was so much the drink holder. Thank you for the

21:42.180 --> 21:47.220
Do you do you play a little piano Judd, uh, I only know one thing uh, here we go lay it on us

21:52.020 --> 21:54.020
Yeah

21:54.020 --> 21:56.020
Now

21:57.220 --> 22:01.140
Within the category of people that learned anything on piano, that's lazy

22:02.420 --> 22:07.540
Because you stopped that's like stopping a shave and a haircut and never learning two bits

22:11.940 --> 22:17.300
Okay, he just but he was improvising I figured that out he inverted the first part

22:18.580 --> 22:22.020
Back when he was eight his mom was like judge if you know mom it's hard

22:22.020 --> 22:27.140
I'm tired of it. You just wanted a microphone stand. I thought you wanted like like a piece of furniture

22:27.460 --> 22:29.460
That could have saved me a whole lot of calories

22:30.740 --> 22:32.740
Well, you did get him a piece of furniture

22:33.300 --> 22:37.860
You're you're just like a Victorian lord over there. Oh, yeah

22:39.060 --> 22:44.020
This desk is outstanding. Well, I'll start by asking probably it might be a question you've been asked before

22:44.100 --> 22:47.140
Can everyone in the building have a job? Yes. Yes

22:47.140 --> 22:54.100
Uh, do you do you have to it is like, oh, is your interview going to be about what it's like to be, uh,

22:54.980 --> 22:58.260
famous, uh, is that is that is that is that something that worries you?

22:58.900 --> 23:03.060
What it's like to be famous. No to be interviewed by somebody that's just going to do that instead of, uh,

23:04.180 --> 23:10.260
Like like like like like talking about you as if you're an inhuman demagogue and like wondering what you're asking

23:10.260 --> 23:13.780
Like what what's it like and are there no, I like it. I like it. Okay. Okay

23:13.780 --> 23:19.140
I this is my level of fame. I just I I was at Disneyland and somebody said to me

23:19.380 --> 23:22.580
They said, you know, if someone asks for your autograph at Disneyland

23:22.900 --> 23:27.700
They will send security over and they will let you cut the lines the rest of the day

23:28.820 --> 23:32.580
You know, so it's like tom hanks goes. It's a security problem that people started asking for autographs

23:32.900 --> 23:35.380
So I think it said two people asked for your autograph

23:35.860 --> 23:39.860
Security will walk you around the rest of the day and let you cut the lines

23:39.860 --> 23:43.540
So the next time I went to Disneyland, I wore a 40-year-old virgin t-shirt

23:45.380 --> 23:47.780
And I did not get asked for an autograph

23:48.500 --> 23:50.500
One time I was looking at people's eyes

23:50.580 --> 23:51.940
so

23:51.940 --> 23:58.180
You may have a dysmorphia about my level of uh of success and awareness. That is an insane distracting

23:58.660 --> 23:59.940
uh

23:59.940 --> 24:02.420
policy on their part. I mean, I thought like

24:03.380 --> 24:07.860
That how does that make you feel when you hear that it doesn't that makes fills me with panic

24:07.860 --> 24:11.540
Like oh, it makes me so happy because then I figured out how to crack the code

24:11.860 --> 24:16.900
Which is I bring my wife, right? That's one person and then it's easier, but it doesn't work solo

24:17.700 --> 24:22.580
How do you how do you verify that you have to walk up to somebody that's an employee there and say hello

24:22.900 --> 24:26.100
My name is jen epitow. I haven't asked for two autographs

24:29.460 --> 24:31.460
I'm in a real hurry

24:31.540 --> 24:33.780
You know, you have to be the lamest person in the world to do it

24:33.780 --> 24:37.860
But when you're cutting the lines, it's so worth it like every second of it. Yeah

24:38.100 --> 24:43.300
I mean, we'd almost do anything to cut a line. I would imagine but that's why it's like it's like

24:43.460 --> 24:49.060
Yeah, because people like going wheelchairs. They put on fake casts and going wheelchairs to cut lines

24:49.540 --> 24:53.940
So you got to do what you got to do. You know, it's cool now like because I'm not famous, but I

24:55.380 --> 24:57.780
I am occasionally on whose line is it anyway

24:58.260 --> 25:02.340
Everybody that everybody that works at uh, disneyland is 24

25:02.340 --> 25:06.020
They all are theater kids. They all took an improv class

25:07.300 --> 25:12.180
So church my girlfriend and I we went there and we were like way more famous than you there because

25:14.900 --> 25:16.900
Well, there are VIPs

25:17.460 --> 25:22.420
Certain spaces where you're famous, but only in like that room, right, you know, yeah

25:22.420 --> 25:28.820
It was good because that but that's gonna stop in three years because they're all gonna be too old and no one's gonna know

25:28.820 --> 25:30.180
Who the fuck I am

25:30.180 --> 25:33.540
But they're gonna know who you are, but you have to not you have to wear the right shirt

25:34.900 --> 25:42.660
I have to wear a portial version t-shirt. I'm impressed and uh, uh, yeah that it's not an out of swarm because my panic

25:42.900 --> 25:46.020
I would imagine imagining life in your shoes and be like, well

25:47.540 --> 25:51.700
It's there. It's that it's that can I have a job thing like it's all like like like you're

25:52.340 --> 25:56.500
Your your brand is that you can give people movies. Yeah

25:56.500 --> 25:58.500
I

25:58.900 --> 26:03.620
Like it just seems kind of dangerous. It's like I'm only famous for he might yell at you if he's drunk

26:04.900 --> 26:06.900
like

26:07.220 --> 26:15.460
But like to be to be kind of like that that's that's part of your brand like like that that would be not only like an invitation for a lot of like

26:17.860 --> 26:23.620
Kind kinds of conversations that would make me very anxious. Well, like it's sundance is a bad place for me to go

26:23.620 --> 26:28.660
Because if I walk up or down the street and sundance and everyone's kind of just looking for anyone who makes movies

26:29.220 --> 26:32.820
You know they spot you and now they hand you like memory sticks

26:33.220 --> 26:35.220
Which have a screenplay on them

26:35.460 --> 26:39.620
Which you really can't put a strange memory stick into your computer, right?

26:40.980 --> 26:43.780
That could be anything really that might be anything

26:44.580 --> 26:49.540
That might be something awful that goes into your computer. I told I've told the story of this podcast before but the what the

26:49.540 --> 26:55.620
It's it was I did a panel and a girl came up and she said mr. Harmon

26:55.860 --> 27:00.980
I'm such an admirer of your work. Like, um, do you think I can I please like

27:01.940 --> 27:04.900
I know this is crazy, but I just always wanted to be a writer and

27:05.380 --> 27:06.900
I oh like I

27:06.900 --> 27:11.300
You're a role model to me and and if you it would just mean a lot if you would sign

27:11.860 --> 27:15.540
Uh my screenplay and and I'm like, oh, you know, no problem

27:15.540 --> 27:19.220
I get here. I like of course, I'll do this thing that you're telling me is crazy

27:19.700 --> 27:24.900
I think and and like so I take it and I sign it and she goes and if you could read it that'd be great and walked away

27:27.140 --> 27:32.500
Now do you ever for the hell of it read a stranger's screenplay like would you ever just read that?

27:32.580 --> 27:38.100
I had I had to open that one because because my religion dictated that I needed that girl to be a bad writer

27:38.260 --> 27:40.100
in that

27:40.100 --> 27:44.420
Is that like because what if she's good and I and I just throw it in the garbage because I felt like

27:44.420 --> 27:46.420
Yeah, like how dare she

27:46.980 --> 27:51.140
So I was like, I got to fucking read it and I'm like three pages and I'm like, yeah, that's pretty sweaty

27:53.300 --> 27:57.300
Judd, how did uh like Camille and emily come to you with the big sec

27:57.780 --> 28:04.580
Were you pals with him before that? Well, no, not at all. I I went to Atlanta. I don't like Austin

28:04.820 --> 28:06.820
Haven't seen it

28:07.780 --> 28:12.340
It's very good to show the first episode of girls and

28:12.340 --> 28:13.700
uh

28:13.700 --> 28:21.780
Dave raffa who is a manager for Pete Holmes said will you do Pete Holmes podcast and I said who's Pete Holmes and

28:22.740 --> 28:26.180
Pete Holmes popped out of a bush and went he's an experience

28:28.820 --> 28:30.820
I love I love Pete Holmes

28:32.100 --> 28:37.140
But at the time I wasn't doing stand-up and I didn't really know who anybody was I was really out of the loop

28:37.620 --> 28:39.620
and so I showed up and it was

28:39.620 --> 28:43.620
Uh, Pete Holmes was interviewing Camille and uh, Chris gethard

28:44.180 --> 28:49.540
Uh, and I think Todd Barry and uh, I love Todd. He's great. We we met on stage

28:49.940 --> 28:53.140
And then it was just really weird that over the next few years

28:53.700 --> 28:57.220
I I produced Chris's uh one-man show

28:58.500 --> 29:01.540
And uh, and then I'm now working with Pete on

29:02.180 --> 29:05.380
Crashing and worked with Camille. So it was the most productive

29:05.380 --> 29:11.380
podcast of all time and then he came in and he pitched me this crazy story about

29:12.020 --> 29:12.900
um

29:12.900 --> 29:18.900
Emily and the coma and all of it and I just thought I'm not no one has a story that good like everyone

29:19.540 --> 29:21.540
No one's like anecdote of their life

29:21.780 --> 29:26.900
Yeah, it's just dark enough too because it like makes you have to wonder well if I had one date and then

29:27.620 --> 29:28.980
it's like

29:28.980 --> 29:32.260
It's like it's like a it's like a thing that feels just a little too dark to

29:32.260 --> 29:36.900
Yeah, to to make jokes about uh, or you know what I go there, which is like always

29:37.860 --> 29:40.500
And he said, you know, I fell in love with her while she was in the coma

29:41.060 --> 29:45.220
And I thought well that seems like a good movie, but at the time I didn't really even know Camille

29:45.540 --> 29:49.700
I didn't really but I thought this is a great idea. Does anybody really know Camille?

29:51.220 --> 29:53.220
You can't know Camille

29:54.660 --> 29:57.140
You can only know my horrible impression of him

29:57.140 --> 30:05.140
I've never heard one of those. That's pretty good. I worked with him for four years. I don't have any impression

30:05.140 --> 30:07.140
I cannot do a Camille impression

30:07.140 --> 30:13.700
So we think you know how every like if you're a bad impression officer James Adomian has a different fucking process than me for his impressions

30:14.340 --> 30:15.380
but uh

30:15.380 --> 30:18.660
Like you know, like if you want to if you're if you're not if you don't do impressions

30:18.660 --> 30:24.900
But you want to try to do one you there's like a phrase or a word that you that you get that gets you started like for

30:24.900 --> 30:28.100
Camille it's it's it's cunt because that's how he says can't

30:28.980 --> 30:30.980
Oh

30:31.540 --> 30:34.740
That's right. It was funny like I thought I wouldn't have done. Oh, what did you call me?

30:36.260 --> 30:40.980
I'd like to hear an extended Camille impression. Like can you keep going? No, I don't want you because

30:41.460 --> 30:43.460
Be Camille in and out of

30:44.740 --> 30:50.260
A Burger King drive-through and try to order something as Camille, but you cannot use the word cunt

30:52.500 --> 30:54.180
You have to use every word but that

30:54.180 --> 30:57.700
Now you have given people opportunities that change their life

30:58.740 --> 31:00.740
I don't know about that

31:03.700 --> 31:08.180
Doesn't look like a changed life, but I'm still I'm still working at the apple store

31:09.620 --> 31:12.340
This this this used to be an apple store

31:13.300 --> 31:15.300
But it was pretty much

31:15.460 --> 31:18.020
His desk wasn't always an Edwardian

31:18.020 --> 31:24.420
Um, beautifully enameled desk like he's really moved up. Yeah. Well, I mean, but you you've

31:25.460 --> 31:28.820
How much of you pays that forward because as we were discussing backstage

31:29.780 --> 31:33.940
Your term was the patient zero. I was using neither of these phrases are going to be flattering to him

31:34.500 --> 31:38.980
But ben stiller is like that you call them the patient zero. I call them the the lastot

31:41.460 --> 31:43.460
Ben ben like

31:43.460 --> 31:48.020
Let's use the term very loosely because you're you're you're a self-starter and you he

31:48.580 --> 31:54.580
But he he discovered plucked you whatever phrase you want. He was like ben grabbed you and and it was the ben stiller show

31:55.380 --> 31:56.900
Like you were

31:56.900 --> 32:02.580
What was your title on that? Were you ep? Well, I know I was the executive producer, but that was just a funny moment

32:02.980 --> 32:04.420
in time I was uh

32:04.420 --> 32:08.100
My main job then was I was writing hbo specials for tom Arnold

32:08.100 --> 32:13.140
And I wrote rosanne's act with her for a year and I was doing a lot of like

32:14.020 --> 32:17.300
Tom Arnold special where he does the uh, my big penis

32:18.660 --> 32:20.660
My big penis

32:20.660 --> 32:23.700
It was at a stand-up special or like he well, it was like a it was like a

32:24.580 --> 32:28.500
Pre-tape sketch that that that that did that was part of a special

32:29.620 --> 32:31.620
It could be to the tune of my shirona

32:32.900 --> 32:34.900
My big penis

32:34.900 --> 32:36.900
My shirona

32:38.580 --> 32:43.060
Things that like no one remembers at all like there were three tom Arnold specials

32:43.220 --> 32:47.460
There'd be kind of like a sketch and then it would turn into like a piece of like tom trying to solve a problem

32:47.460 --> 32:53.460
Like almost like a reality comedy piece. It was called tom Arnold the naked truth. How many people saw one of those?

32:54.500 --> 32:56.100
Oh damn

32:56.100 --> 32:58.420
Like two people. This is how fast the culture

32:59.060 --> 33:01.060
Discards greatness. Yeah

33:01.060 --> 33:09.780
Well comedy doesn't age well, but also old people like they I mean this is it's about a while old people age great

33:11.140 --> 33:15.620
That's their main thing. You know why it's weird is I always think like that was 20

33:16.500 --> 33:21.700
Uh six 27 years ago. What was it? What was the bits like like what would I remember after that?

33:21.780 --> 33:24.260
Well, we went to the mall and chris farley

33:24.660 --> 33:30.340
There was a piece about how to pick up women and we we shot chris farley walking around a mall hitting on strangers

33:30.340 --> 33:32.340
Like with the hidden cameras

33:32.580 --> 33:39.940
When no one knew chris farley was so actual like like candy camera. That's what one of the bits was one of the bits was and uh

33:40.580 --> 33:45.220
What was it on like it was on hbo, but but I always look at it like this like when I was a kid in

33:46.340 --> 33:48.340
1977

33:48.980 --> 33:50.980
27 years earlier

33:50.980 --> 33:52.980
was 1950

33:53.460 --> 33:54.820
so

33:54.820 --> 33:55.700
from

33:55.700 --> 33:57.700
The Ben Stiller show from here

33:57.700 --> 34:04.900
Is 1950 right? Yeah, I know it's crazy when you through realize that it's like I keep I keep think of well

34:04.900 --> 34:08.500
You know, mr. Show was the most recent good sketch show and

34:09.700 --> 34:11.700
No, we're all dying

34:12.980 --> 34:15.700
I I hung out with mark mckinney in new york and

34:17.220 --> 34:19.220
I was like

34:19.220 --> 34:20.260
Why do you look so good?

34:20.260 --> 34:25.700
And it was like oh because because we've gotten so old that he's now injured a second phase of his life where he's now

34:25.700 --> 34:27.700
He's a handsome old man

34:28.820 --> 34:30.820
I hope he doesn't hear that

34:31.300 --> 34:36.740
But it's like it's like it's like we there's some some of some of our peers are getting handsome again

34:36.980 --> 34:40.820
It's been so long and we're so close to death. Yeah, they're um

34:41.380 --> 34:46.180
Jen Jen I I've recently become kind of palsy with uh with uh

34:46.980 --> 34:50.980
Fig like that's with pofig and you dress like pofig. Well, he no he dresses better

34:51.060 --> 34:54.820
Yes, because because he has pofig did not used to wear suits all the time

34:54.820 --> 34:59.380
He used to wear bowling shirts all the time. Yes, he did and on a dime. He went suit

34:59.860 --> 35:04.900
Yeah, just on a dime like by the way starting tomorrow. I will wear a suit every day for the rest of my life

35:05.540 --> 35:07.540
I was I was talking to my girlfriend

35:07.540 --> 35:13.460
Like if we had all the money in the world, we would just dress like fancy at all times and like bespoke shit

35:13.860 --> 35:17.700
But paul does like paul really has bespoke shoes and suits

35:17.860 --> 35:21.380
Yeah, and I went the other way which is about three years ago

35:21.380 --> 35:27.940
I decided that every day of my life. I would wear a black james purse polo shirt

35:32.260 --> 35:34.260
I just I just uh

35:34.500 --> 35:40.420
Kept wearing Rick and Morty shirts until there were so many people watching at the 20% of the people were nazis and then

35:40.420 --> 35:50.100
Because it's a good show that's loved by a lot of really wonderful people and there's good there's good people on both sides

35:52.900 --> 35:56.980
But but and I was like I can't and now it's what it really was it was it wasn't because of that

35:56.980 --> 36:02.660
I'm being glib but but uh, um, but it was because actually oh the shows become so popular that I don't want to look like

36:02.740 --> 36:07.460
I'm trying doing the this is 40 t-shirt thing and so well you weren't at disneyland

36:07.460 --> 36:12.980
So now I just have I'm just rotating between three henleys because I finally found out henleys are slimming. That's it

36:13.540 --> 36:16.980
But this is what we do because we we don't want to exercise

36:17.300 --> 36:23.060
We don't really want to eat well and we're just searching for a shirt that makes us look kind of shitty. Yeah

36:24.900 --> 36:31.380
This is 45 and 50. Um, I want to go backwards but because the show is brought to you by men's rights activists

36:31.380 --> 36:36.580
Um, the the

36:38.420 --> 36:40.980
Actually, let's rewind just a little bit before Ben's because

36:42.180 --> 36:46.820
I didn't know that so my imagining was like I was picturing Ben plucking you from like

36:47.380 --> 36:53.300
I think you started, uh, like when you were in high school, you were your mom was working at a, uh, uh

36:54.100 --> 36:56.100
No, gee, Dan. Did you read his wikipedia page?

36:56.180 --> 36:58.660
Um, your mom was your mom was working at a comedy club

36:58.660 --> 37:03.700
Yeah, my parents got divorced so my mom was seating people at a comedy club because my parents used to own a restaurant

37:03.940 --> 37:07.780
And the guy was the bartender who went on to become like a big, uh

37:08.500 --> 37:13.060
Manager of the Tim Allen and Drew Carey this guy rick. Messina. He opened a it was rick

37:13.300 --> 37:17.700
It was rick and he opened a comedy club on Long Island. So in the aftermath of this terrible divorce

37:18.260 --> 37:24.260
my mom who was broke was just she was seating people at a comedy club and uh,

37:24.260 --> 37:32.020
And uh, so that was maybe 1982 or something that that summer how old were you and I was, uh, you know, uh 15 or 14

37:32.900 --> 37:35.140
It's kind of like there's there's there's kids these days

37:35.220 --> 37:38.580
It would be a podcast now, but it's like there's that archetype where it's like

37:39.300 --> 37:42.500
There's the there's the mogul that pays it back

37:42.820 --> 37:49.060
And then there's the there's also but you started as that kind of like self-starting precocious guy that who

37:49.060 --> 37:55.780
Through your mom's job. You were getting like headliners to come and do your interview show that you did for what?

37:55.860 --> 38:00.580
AV club in high school or for the high school radio station that really didn't even get out of the parking lot

38:00.980 --> 38:04.260
And so because what happened is I went to the see all the comedy shows all summer

38:04.260 --> 38:07.700
And it was like Paul Provenza and Jay Leno and people like that

38:08.020 --> 38:11.140
And I just in my little teenage head. I thought I need to meet them

38:11.620 --> 38:14.580
How can I meet them and I had a friend who used to interview rock bands?

38:14.580 --> 38:19.620
Like REM like when they first started for the high school radio station and he's like maybe you could start a show

38:19.620 --> 38:25.300
Where you interview comics and that'll be an excuse to call them and then I would call them and uh

38:25.620 --> 38:33.220
I the first interview I did was Steve Allen and I I show up. I didn't have a tape recorder. I literally brought a boom box

38:34.580 --> 38:40.580
That had a record function and I put like the boom box on the table and press record was it was very civil with you?

38:40.580 --> 38:44.580
Yeah, at that one

38:44.980 --> 38:48.980
And so that was the beginning of it and then but that was like there were no podcasts

38:48.980 --> 38:55.140
There was no way to know what anyone thought about anything and in my head. I'm like, I wish I could talk

38:55.540 --> 38:57.540
To Harold Ramis and ask

38:57.620 --> 39:02.580
But it was still a it's still an archetype that kind of transcends technology because now that kid would have a podcast

39:02.660 --> 39:07.220
But it is there is a there's an archetype there. Yeah, like the kid the precocious kid who's like

39:07.220 --> 39:11.220
I'm like, please sir. I'm just interested in your funny comedy and the and the the

39:12.500 --> 39:16.980
People getting a kick out of like well, I'd be a pretty good person for uh being on this

39:17.540 --> 39:22.500
This kid's show and treating him like an equal and I just proved I'm a great guy

39:22.580 --> 39:29.140
Like I've I've done that for a certain podcast of like do you do you never I people ask me to do it

39:29.140 --> 39:31.140
I know never do it

39:31.300 --> 39:33.460
The kids like you did it. I'm just like fuck off

39:33.460 --> 39:40.180
I don't know I don't know so they bet the like the kind of baptismal moment is ben stiller doing what he also did for me in

39:40.180 --> 39:42.180
Schrab and what he's done for

39:42.740 --> 39:47.460
So many that it's kind of crazy that if he wasn't also ben stiller and therefore

39:48.100 --> 39:53.380
Interesting in different ways it would be a naturally very interesting thing about him that he that he's that he

39:54.260 --> 40:02.020
Sees like yeah, he's just like this frog tongue goes and just grabs the juiciest fly. That's a horrible way of putting it

40:02.020 --> 40:07.060
Why do you have to take something wonderful about a guy that I owe everything to and purposely

40:07.380 --> 40:09.380
Turned it into the most grotesque thing I could

40:09.780 --> 40:17.060
Everything you know why is because I started to realize I was flattering myself because I oh my my benefactor has great taste

40:18.260 --> 40:21.940
So I I I hit like an ear breaker. I was like no make it gross and dumb

40:22.420 --> 40:27.780
Well back then, you know, it was different because comedy wasn't as big so like stiller

40:27.780 --> 40:32.580
I think he was on four or five episodes of Saturday Night Live. He was like a writer performer

40:32.740 --> 40:36.900
They kind of didn't let him on the show how he got on the show is a crazy story

40:36.900 --> 40:41.860
Which is he made a short film which is a parody of the movie a color of the color of money

40:42.100 --> 40:46.020
Which is about pool. Yeah, he did a version with John Mahoney, which was bowling

40:46.260 --> 40:49.220
Yeah, and he played Tom Cruise and John Mahoney played

40:49.860 --> 40:52.580
Paul Newell. He was a really good impressionist like he really did

40:52.580 --> 40:58.020
Well, Tom Cruise was insane. Yeah, no one did Tom Cruise. No one was doing a Tom Cruise impression

40:58.580 --> 41:01.220
I mean back then people were still doing like Jimmy Cagney and stuff

41:03.220 --> 41:05.220
Spiro Acneu

41:05.380 --> 41:09.620
And so so he makes this film he waits in the lobby at NBC

41:10.580 --> 41:15.380
And he sees John Lovett's and he hands it to him and says will you show someone at Saturday Night Live?

41:16.020 --> 41:19.460
And he did and then they said we're gonna put it on this weekend

41:19.460 --> 41:22.900
And people loved it and then he got asked to be on the show, but when he was on the show

41:22.900 --> 41:27.220
He was like I want to make short films. No one there wanted him to make short films

41:27.620 --> 41:31.700
so he left like he quit Saturday Night Live like in six weeks and

41:32.260 --> 41:36.020
He did a show for MTV and then that didn't go but had some great

41:36.740 --> 41:39.700
Like a u2 parody that was pretty incredible. It was really good

41:40.020 --> 41:43.460
And and then I met him online at Elvis Costello unplugged

41:44.100 --> 41:46.420
I was with Dana Gould and he had met Ben

41:46.420 --> 41:51.380
And we both knew HBO was looking to produce the sketch show and then

41:52.100 --> 41:56.340
Ben and I met we thought of an idea and we sold it like two weeks later

41:56.660 --> 41:58.660
And we had known each other for two weeks

41:59.380 --> 42:01.940
When the show got sold like everyone thought we were pals

42:02.660 --> 42:06.260
But we literally just met but he didn't know that I didn't know how to do anything

42:07.540 --> 42:09.540
And it was was he did he

42:11.300 --> 42:15.140
He got you that EP credit right like he he probably like fought for you and

42:15.140 --> 42:17.140
I might have had better credits than him

42:17.380 --> 42:21.060
Oh, okay. Well, if you're doing you're doing all those specials that's that's the chapter that I know

42:21.140 --> 42:23.460
It was a mistake because HBO wanted a sketch show

42:23.860 --> 42:31.140
And then we pitched it for HBO and HBO started a production company and they sold it to be the so they were the producers

42:31.380 --> 42:36.900
So it would air on fox. So so fox had no vetting process of like these are children

42:38.180 --> 42:41.140
They shouldn't have a network show and suddenly I'm the executive producer

42:41.140 --> 42:48.100
From like just writing jokes, but this is like after like Christopher guests like stuff like they would they would do their little shorts on

42:48.340 --> 42:50.340
On snl, right? Yes. So

42:51.300 --> 42:54.500
That was already kind of a thing. Yeah, but then that became

42:55.380 --> 43:00.420
Like that was is that where mr. Show kind of was like it's like it's like the protoplasmic mr. Show

43:00.740 --> 43:07.460
Odin Kirk and cross were on it Garofalo Andy Dick our friend Dino Stamatopoulos was was on it and uh

43:08.260 --> 43:09.780
and

43:09.780 --> 43:11.780
Rob Cohen

43:11.780 --> 43:15.460
And uh, but it was all done with uh, like it

43:16.180 --> 43:19.940
You know, we were so naive. We didn't know that there was a thing called casting

43:21.300 --> 43:25.300
So when they said who's like in the show like who's your your troop

43:26.180 --> 43:28.740
Ben and I just sat down in like five minutes just went

43:29.380 --> 43:31.380
Well bob and andy are funny

43:31.940 --> 43:33.780
And janine's funny

43:33.780 --> 43:35.460
All right

43:35.460 --> 43:40.020
And but we didn't know that in town was jack black and will ferrell and all these people

43:40.340 --> 43:44.020
We just thought well, who's the funniest people in our group that we love

43:44.500 --> 43:48.420
And you hear that janine you you would have been replaced with jack black

43:50.100 --> 43:52.100
He just didn't know he could

43:52.420 --> 43:57.700
But I was like ben would have an instinct like you know, who's hilarious bob and then back then we were like, okay

43:58.020 --> 44:00.020
Like we didn't it wasn't like a corporate

44:00.020 --> 44:07.300
Process to it. It was like how old how old are you in that first kickoff 24? What? Yeah, that's crazy

44:07.380 --> 44:09.380
Hey, I was pretty young

44:12.020 --> 44:14.020
When I

44:14.100 --> 44:15.460
uh

44:15.460 --> 44:17.940
Blogged Dan you're you're 58

44:19.300 --> 44:20.980
I

44:20.980 --> 44:25.540
It's like Ben's we have we refer to this thing called the fraud complex out here

44:25.540 --> 44:32.740
It's it's it's something that I learned early on like I I uh, I was dating uh, you probably know

44:33.060 --> 44:38.980
Tracy katsky. I was like I was she was like my first la girlfriend. I think like um

44:39.860 --> 44:41.860
I remember coveching about something

44:42.180 --> 44:48.660
At probably that age and she also taught you the word convention. Probably yeah, but but but she uh

44:49.140 --> 44:54.980
That she's like was it like I'm just you know drama queen like like about this and that she's like fraud complex

44:54.980 --> 44:56.420
You have a fraud complex

44:56.420 --> 44:58.420
And it runs the industry

44:58.420 --> 45:02.340
But but I think ben stiller's fraud complex runs more industry

45:03.140 --> 45:08.580
It's it's like his his ben ben's fraud complex and I hope he wouldn't be offended by that because it's like it's a complex

45:08.580 --> 45:15.300
It doesn't mean he's a front. He's more than proven that but he's he he was he was born with these parents that

45:16.020 --> 45:21.860
You know where they were the the rest of us have these stories about being in our pajamas and running out at the parties and being like

45:21.940 --> 45:23.940
Oh, and here's this little sociopath

45:23.940 --> 45:31.060
Um, let's all pay attention to them the funniest guy in the midwest and ben stiller is the son of these

45:31.780 --> 45:38.900
Legendary hilarious amazing party animal comedy people who are never going to be out shown no matter what his pajamas look like

45:39.460 --> 45:42.740
And and and I think and I think that we owe that

45:43.620 --> 45:48.020
We owe everything to that but like we owe better calls all to that we owe everything

45:48.020 --> 45:54.820
It's like like the the the chart of what ben stiller being so unsatisfied being so unable to just go

45:55.060 --> 45:57.060
Yeah nailed it

45:57.060 --> 46:00.420
That made him quit snl before he like drowned in it

46:00.500 --> 46:06.020
It made him like do 13 episodes to show with you that won an emmy after I got cancelled

46:06.740 --> 46:09.780
It made it makes him it made him at least at that time like

46:10.580 --> 46:14.740
He he he just always is like oh that person's funny or who do you say is funny?

46:14.740 --> 46:18.900
Like if I hear someone's funny, I just go well fuck that person. I'll figure out why later

46:20.340 --> 46:23.620
But and then maybe over time I'll go Dan. What are you doing? Calm down go to therapy

46:24.180 --> 46:25.620
Maybe someone's funny

46:25.620 --> 46:29.220
But but I feel like ben would hear someone's funny you'd go. Oh really?

46:30.020 --> 46:32.980
How how funny can I can I meet them like I can I help them?

46:33.220 --> 46:36.820
Well, it was for ben. I'd watch it. It was like falling in love

46:37.380 --> 46:44.020
Like we saw Owen Wilson when we were casting the cable guy and you could just see it was like a comedy falling in love

46:44.020 --> 46:50.180
You know we saw a little piece of bottle rocket and we just lost our mind like this is going to be the greatest thing ever

46:50.420 --> 46:52.420
We thought the movie would make $200

46:53.860 --> 46:55.860
and and

46:56.100 --> 46:58.340
And then that happened with jack black and with a bunch of people

46:59.060 --> 47:02.820
Over the years with that. Yes. So when you started off by saying I

47:03.460 --> 47:06.580
Our version of casting is just picking the four people that we know

47:07.300 --> 47:10.260
Now that you get the pick of the litter like how does that work for you now?

47:10.820 --> 47:12.820
How does it work now?

47:12.820 --> 47:17.140
Well, you know, you know sometimes I have a lot of energy for casting when we did freaks and geeks

47:17.540 --> 47:19.940
We said, well, let's get real kids. It'll work better with real kids

47:19.940 --> 47:23.540
So me and paul and jcass and we would do open calls and no one does this

47:23.620 --> 47:27.780
We just go we're at a school at noon in vancouver

47:28.260 --> 47:30.260
Anyone can come read for us

47:30.740 --> 47:36.180
And a thousand people would show up and we did that in chicago and new york and some other places

47:36.500 --> 47:40.020
And and we found people that way and then other projects

47:40.020 --> 47:47.220
You're just tired and you just realize fine. I'm not going to look at that many people but this one seems seems good

47:47.460 --> 47:54.020
It doesn't feel great. Do you give yourself credit for when you look at freaks and geeks and the fact that that was in terms of the

47:54.260 --> 47:58.420
Lestot factor the patient zero that you became patient negative one

47:59.060 --> 48:01.060
That are you are you do you?

48:01.300 --> 48:08.020
Do you acknowledge that do you feel proud of that that that every single person in freaks and geeks went on to become an entire

48:08.020 --> 48:13.060
You know cottage industry and that that actually doesn't usually happen and that that means that you

48:14.020 --> 48:17.780
Picked up that Ben Stiller habit. Yeah. I mean, it's so weird

48:18.500 --> 48:22.980
Now when you really look at it and how deep into the show and there's a whole nother level at the show

48:22.980 --> 48:26.100
We're like Shia LaBeouf was on the show. I saw these other people

48:26.820 --> 48:29.460
You know, we were discovering people that we didn't even

48:30.580 --> 48:32.580
Whatever, I'm not gonna finish that

48:34.020 --> 48:35.700
You know, but it uh

48:35.700 --> 48:40.500
I always thought I was who was great. You know, it's a very weird thing. You know, when you open it up to

48:41.380 --> 48:44.980
We're just gonna hire great kids. We're not gonna go. I need a blonde for this

48:45.060 --> 48:49.860
I need a tall guy with this attitude just who of every kid that you could show us is great

48:50.420 --> 48:55.620
And we will rewrite Paul will rewrite the script to tailor it to these people

48:56.580 --> 48:58.740
You can find amazing people

48:58.740 --> 49:04.340
But also I felt terrible about the fact that I knew the show was gonna get cancelled and all these kids had like

49:04.340 --> 49:06.340
foregone college

49:07.380 --> 49:09.380
I really you know, that was the time where there was a

49:10.100 --> 49:12.100
Way more young stars robbing

49:12.580 --> 49:19.220
liquor stars and things and I thought I need to not allow that to happen my Jewish co-dependency kicked in

49:19.860 --> 49:21.940
And and so and I knew they were all great

49:21.940 --> 49:26.580
So I wanted to keep the team together, but I was also afraid for their their lives

49:26.820 --> 49:32.180
Yeah, they don't do that anymore like they don't write they I guess they slide over to youtube and get robbed

49:32.180 --> 49:40.020
But like google, which should they survive which of you two think it's gonna play the other one and the movie about

49:40.100 --> 49:42.100
the other person

49:42.820 --> 49:44.820
What's more likely

49:45.220 --> 49:47.780
Uh, yeah, I answer my question

49:49.620 --> 49:56.100
It's just I mean, I'll facilitate this in any way I can I'll I'll I'll I'll play a Judd in a movie

49:56.740 --> 49:58.740
That's a little darker more of the

49:58.820 --> 50:00.340
You were in funny people

50:00.340 --> 50:03.300
That's right. A lot of people don't know you started my acting career

50:03.780 --> 50:08.660
You and kyle kahane. Yeah. Yeah, kyle kahane and I I said I said I

50:09.380 --> 50:14.500
You were saying like oh these paparazzi guys are obnoxious and they say these terrible things and I was like really they say like

50:15.220 --> 50:17.220
like really and and and I

50:17.540 --> 50:20.340
I can't remember if it was in the cut or if it's just like in my memory

50:20.420 --> 50:25.380
It was like I felt I felt really bad because I I said to adam sandler's character

50:25.460 --> 50:28.100
Is it was it aids or cancer and then he he went

50:28.100 --> 50:35.220
Like like and I it felt and I saw this I felt like it was like oh fuck. I'm one of those extras that

50:35.860 --> 50:41.380
You pushed it. You pushed it. That he was like Jesus fucking Christ. Can I work or are you are you done being funny?

50:41.380 --> 50:46.420
You fucking get a paparazzi number two. You know, I was like it was like I think the final joke we wound up with or

50:46.820 --> 50:50.980
Was just that you it's a saying like is it true that you're gonna be in the ghost busters reboot

50:51.700 --> 50:56.100
Is that that must have been kyle probably uh, that's that's that's that sounds very smart and uh

50:56.100 --> 51:03.940
Um, uh, yeah, well, so so but it's it's so so freaks and geeks and then that precedes

51:04.500 --> 51:10.660
Uh, uh, larry sanders show right like that's no that's after larry sanders. Oh shit. Okay, so now we gotta

51:10.740 --> 51:12.740
I explain all of this in my masterclass

51:14.740 --> 51:19.700
$90 and you get five hours of this. I didn't I didn't know that you worked on larry sanders

51:19.780 --> 51:21.860
I I didn't know that you worked on larry sanders

51:21.860 --> 51:26.420
I worked on larry sanders and you know when we did freaks and geeks in my head the whole time. I would think

51:26.980 --> 51:30.980
Uh, I would trick myself into thinking I was still at larry sanders

51:31.620 --> 51:36.420
And this is just a scene about some of their kids and I thought if I just write this

51:36.980 --> 51:42.180
The way gary would approach sanders, right? It'll be right and they said that was like my little private

51:42.260 --> 51:48.020
Was sam simon over still around on that sam simon was on it's Garry Shandling show. Oh, so yeah, he wasn't on the other one

51:48.020 --> 51:51.060
Yeah, they asked you something about larry sanders because I don't think I've ever

51:51.940 --> 51:54.740
I don't know who to talk to that's been on that you you knew had a hand in it

51:56.180 --> 51:58.180
um, the the

51:58.420 --> 52:03.140
When I watch it like I think I did like a rewatch of it a couple years ago and uh

52:04.100 --> 52:06.660
what it looks to me like

52:07.220 --> 52:08.740
it

52:08.740 --> 52:14.820
Well, you guys were developing it that the idea would have been that it would have been this kind of noises off hybrid

52:14.820 --> 52:22.100
That it was going to be very the there was a formula there that we were going to be rooted in the talk show and that it was going to be

52:22.660 --> 52:28.420
Um stories were going to threaten to derail the show as we told it and then it clearly evolved into a thing

52:28.420 --> 52:32.900
Or like we definitely didn't care if we ever saw what was happening on stage that that was just like a weird

52:33.700 --> 52:35.700
Mill that that that sometimes

52:35.780 --> 52:42.100
Collapsed or and and drove everything is that so in that like like you just described like like was that an evolution?

52:42.100 --> 52:46.660
Am I accurate? Uh, I think that gary. I think gary said he was had

52:47.780 --> 52:52.420
Uh, the tonight show and he was hosting and there was some sort of problem with little richard

52:54.100 --> 52:59.540
That little richard was mad about something and he was watching a producer trying to like calm down little richard

52:59.940 --> 53:05.140
And I think that he realized like there's a there's a whole emotional world behind this show

53:05.460 --> 53:08.500
Which has to do with you know, you have this ego maniacal

53:08.500 --> 53:12.020
Uh host that everyone is trying to figure out what he wants

53:12.580 --> 53:16.180
And there's a there's all these relationships between the the back

53:16.660 --> 53:21.540
crew and that through the backstage of the talk show you could explore just the entire human

53:22.100 --> 53:30.020
Condition and I think gary was fascinated by his own problems with wanting to be successful and famous and like he hated

53:30.500 --> 53:32.020
his own

53:32.020 --> 53:34.020
ego maniacal

53:34.020 --> 53:36.420
tendencies and it really became a show

53:36.420 --> 53:38.420
about

53:38.660 --> 53:40.180
It was enough

53:40.180 --> 53:46.500
It could have been a black box theater show that never that one of the sets you could have broken down the set of the talk show

53:46.660 --> 53:51.220
Yeah, he kept using it, but it was like it was his office and it was the kitchenette

53:51.220 --> 53:55.220
It was because it was like and it was it was just this crazy

53:57.540 --> 54:00.740
Self-loathing like like weird spiraling

54:01.460 --> 54:04.900
Portrait of this god the kind of guy that's good at this job

54:04.900 --> 54:07.460
And there's nothing that will make him happy right, you know

54:07.460 --> 54:09.460
He wants success at all costs

54:10.020 --> 54:13.700
To the you know to the destruction of most of his relationships

54:14.180 --> 54:19.380
And it's just never works till finally he's pushed off his own show by the younger guy

54:19.860 --> 54:23.540
I'm just I'm yeah, I'm just here which was john steward if I get for you space kids

54:23.700 --> 54:29.300
You little hologram kids. You don't know no larry sanders. You thought it was its Garry Shandling show. Oh, that's uh

54:29.300 --> 54:34.260
It's uh streaming on each wheel also little richards was a black entertainer

54:36.740 --> 54:42.020
It was an ironic name. He was a giant. Yeah, he was I'm certainly he was mad about lucille

54:42.660 --> 54:44.660
Not doing his sister's wheel

54:45.300 --> 54:51.860
But but I just what I'm curious about is do you recall a point in some season of that show

54:52.500 --> 54:56.420
The way that I because I think about rick and morty. Thank you. Um

54:56.420 --> 54:58.420
Um

54:58.500 --> 55:02.180
You have daughters. I I I'm sure you're familiar. Uh, the the

55:04.580 --> 55:08.020
Did that did that sound that maybe because his kids are daughters

55:08.580 --> 55:13.380
We'll certainly fix that one every every everyone with kids is that that's my in now

55:13.460 --> 55:20.820
I can be like like ilan musk has kids. So I've I've touched the fucking space man death. Stop it. Stop it

55:22.660 --> 55:25.140
Stop touching stop touching children

55:25.140 --> 55:28.660
I've got a ilan musk story. All right. Well, okay

55:29.380 --> 55:31.540
I'm gonna tell it quick and interesting like weird

55:32.180 --> 55:36.580
Okay, so I just want to know is there was can we go into a segment called ilan musk stories?

55:36.900 --> 55:38.900
Yes, we can in a second in a second

55:39.540 --> 55:44.580
The the the current segment is I want to hear this like if there's an if there's a point that you remember where

55:44.740 --> 55:49.380
When you're doing larry sanders where this template that you decided on where you're like, you know

55:49.380 --> 55:55.300
We had this whole idea of the show and was there a frustration or a breakdown or an epiphany where

55:56.260 --> 56:00.340
Someone or some faction or some people said we don't even have to ever

56:00.980 --> 56:04.420
See the talk show in order for this to be a good show. Yeah, I don't think that was the turn

56:04.420 --> 56:07.380
I think the turn was in the first year or two. He had a wife

56:07.860 --> 56:13.620
And and I think that gary was writing the wife. He wished he had so he had this like professional

56:13.620 --> 56:22.020
The catherine harold's like smart woman and it was almost like what would a relationship look like if I was sainer

56:22.500 --> 56:26.100
and and and it never played the way that

56:26.900 --> 56:31.700
That it needed to because that wasn't the kind of person that gary dated in real life

56:32.900 --> 56:36.500
And and so that we did have a conversation once about

56:37.220 --> 56:39.220
larry should be single

56:39.220 --> 56:44.180
Because I don't think this is truthful what you're trying to do with your wife

56:44.260 --> 56:48.020
And there was also an x-life character and there were some good episodes and they were great

56:48.180 --> 56:53.780
But as soon as you made him date, I think that was the moment where it became more about his

56:54.660 --> 56:59.700
You know his personal life and how frustrated he was and and then it became more more truthful

56:59.860 --> 57:02.340
I think yeah, I just when I think of that show

57:02.340 --> 57:05.540
I remember who just this is like him walking into work and already

57:05.540 --> 57:10.740
Shielding him from everybody and him just like in his baseball cap and just in that voice

57:10.820 --> 57:14.260
I'm just like not being able to handle it and I can't handle it

57:15.220 --> 57:18.020
Like I like I actually at Eclipse

57:18.100 --> 57:23.060
I forgot that there was another part of that show that like did you ever remember the barney miller pilot?

57:23.300 --> 57:25.300
If you watch the barney miller pilot, there was a lot of his wife

57:25.780 --> 57:30.100
It was like you could tell the pitch was look cops have two lives

57:30.340 --> 57:31.860
They got their work family

57:31.860 --> 57:35.940
And they got their home family because it's like how lindon's putting on his and he like loves his wife

57:36.020 --> 57:40.340
And then he goes to work with these this like crazy sweat hog group of like cops

57:40.420 --> 57:46.260
I'm like the show became a one act play on one set of these crazy cops like how lindon never had a wife again

57:46.740 --> 57:48.740
but um, it it's it's it's

57:49.460 --> 57:51.460
It the weird connection there is that

57:52.260 --> 57:54.580
The dick van dyke show always struggled with that too

57:54.820 --> 57:58.740
Which was the first thing Garry Shandling brought up in the one encounter I ever had with him

57:58.740 --> 58:01.940
Which was right before we lost him and I haven't been able to watch your

58:02.580 --> 58:06.180
your documentary on him because I just I it's it's it's

58:09.220 --> 58:11.780
I also haven't watched it land us and maybe it's for dumb reasons

58:12.100 --> 58:15.380
Like maybe it's because like I don't want to watch jet after I'll be friends with Garry Shandling

58:17.380 --> 58:23.460
But but I also I'd like to credit myself and think like actually it's kind of heartbreaking because as a kid because he was this meta guy

58:23.460 --> 58:30.500
And and and I and sarah silverman bless her heart someone who was smart enough to recognize that I was

58:30.740 --> 58:36.740
She couldn't work with me and yet still would invite me to her rooftop parties and you know, it's it's rare

58:38.180 --> 58:41.540
Well, you mean rare rare for a person not rare for her not for her

58:41.700 --> 58:47.540
But for a person to uh, she cast old like yeah, she's she's just embrace that she's nice

58:48.260 --> 58:50.260
and and uh

58:50.260 --> 58:56.580
And she knew she's like you want to meet Garry Shandling and it was like it would be the last it was the last

58:57.300 --> 59:03.060
I was like, well, yeah, but I was like, you know, like dragging, you know, like it just just meet him

59:03.860 --> 59:05.860
Gary, this is dianne harmon. You don't know him

59:07.060 --> 59:11.860
And it's just like like putting me at a zoo and like like it doesn't matter how this turns out for him

59:11.940 --> 59:17.300
And I say hi gary. I'm dianne harmon. I made a show called NBC game. You know, I've been recently fired from it

59:17.300 --> 59:19.780
Oh, yeah, why why you get fired from it?

59:20.100 --> 59:26.660
Uh, I think I mean I'd like to think is because it was uh, too too inside too meta. He's like, ah, geez

59:26.740 --> 59:28.740
Are they still giving that no

59:29.780 --> 59:35.380
And I was like I was like and then and then because I that's what I wanted to hear from him because his show time show

59:36.180 --> 59:40.820
Not to admit it's like he was always the guy where the painting was part of the frame

59:40.900 --> 59:43.940
But he also loves that you're being real with him

59:43.940 --> 59:47.060
And and that you're you're showing him your pain

59:47.700 --> 59:53.620
And that's why he wanted to talk to you because he really couldn't handle the bullshit, right?

59:53.620 --> 59:55.460
But if you walked up and go like

59:55.460 --> 59:58.420
I'm all fucked up right now. He's like, let's go. Let's let's get into it

59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.100
Yeah, and he but and then he immediately went the rest was him talking about the dick van dyke show

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.420
Which I found so interesting because I never even realized

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:10.420
Dick van dyke show was meta. He worked on goddamn show. He worked on that show

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:16.740
No, no, no, he was saying like what is he fucking networks? Hey, like oh, it's uh inside baseball

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:22.580
It's about tv. So it's not tv fucking dick van dyke worked on my impression is fading

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.020
I turned into Camille. I can't tolerate

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.700
That was that was the best Kumail Nanjiani impression

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.940
But it was and it was so great because it was like like like wow, this is like the what like

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:38.020
Like he he'll never see my show, but I got to say

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:43.540
Uh, the network doesn't like it because they it's about it's about it's aware

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:47.300
And he said like my shit's all aware. I'm like, yeah, why the fuck do you think I wanted to meet you?

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:50.580
And then he's going dick van dyke was aware television is aware

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:54.180
It's supposed to be I got a little drunk. Sorry jet apatow. Well, that

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:58.980
But that you know when that's why I've been unable to watch your documentary because I

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.300
It's like it's like it I also if you did one about Harold Ramis

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:09.220
I also would not be able to watch that because that was a celebrity death that that buckled my name

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.380
Well, how do you think I felt having to like?

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:17.700
Watch hundreds of hours of gary just talking, you know as a friend. You probably loved it. You ghoul

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.180
Elon Musk story

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.380
Who's going first?

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.220
Who's going first?

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.940
Let's start with Dan Dan. You got the first Elon

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.700
I I I don't know if he was trying to throw a party, but he throws terrible parties

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.820
Jet apatow you're up

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.340
Jet apatow Elon Musk story

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:54.740
Okay, before he had the car and he was just like a mystery scientist guy

01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:00.740
Uh, I was at an oscar party and and I was talking to him. I didn't really like know the significance of

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:05.940
Let me just seem like a tall strange very smart man. And uh, and I'm a little drunk

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:09.380
and I don't know he was in whatever space he lives in and uh

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.420
Just the the regular space

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.700
And I was it's where his car is

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.300
And that's weird enough

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:23.300
You're not supposed to live in space. I was asking him what uh, you know what what he's working on and he said

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:29.140
I'm I'm trying to uh invent a rocket ship that will go to mars

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.180
And back and then I said to him

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.940
There's no way you'll figure that out before you're dead

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:52.260
That kind of reminds me of did you ever work with so I'm fucking Elon Musk one night

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:57.620
And I mean, I'm fucking him

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:03.380
Did you did you did you ever work with with with with sam simon

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:09.540
I never worked with sam simon although I love love loved him. There's a there's a story of that jiff

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:15.860
Like sam told jeff this story about himself meeting bill clinton, which is that oh, yes

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:23.700
That that he uh, you know sam sam and he like the simpsons and cheers and fad albert and fucking everything

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:28.340
Oh, yeah, he created everything. I didn't create me. He wrote on everything. Yeah, go ahead. Oh

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.980
I mean

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.140
Now you can tell it if you want

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:38.900
I said that like I don't know where what the context was but sam was meeting bill clinton and who was

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.420
currently the president like when he was meeting him and uh

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:48.820
Uh, and there was some fundraiser who knows what and then the president does his like whole line of things and he's shaking hands

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.940
Okay, see fucking god damn it

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:58.820
I I'm only gonna give you this it was a party that was at a house party in like belair bevelly hills

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:04.500
And someone said I think the president's coming by and everyone's like no, he's fucking not and then

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:09.060
And it wasn't sam's house. It was someone else. Yeah, it wasn't sam's house, but but then

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:11.780
Bill clinton shows up at a house party

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:15.940
There's so many people in this world that you can be at a belair party

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:22.100
And be sam's simon and it and and be and hear that the president's coming by and it's not your house

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:26.100
Like that's that's a lot of rich people

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.060
So now just take it from there because you'll have everything

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:33.620
So then the president comes by and he visits. I'm sure it's complicated when the president comes by

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.740
You could probably get shot for passing the mustard. I don't know they have to

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.180
And I didn't think god I took square dancing if I remember that situation

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:45.620
There's a whole line. I just all I remember of it. It just comes down to a dialogue couplet

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:51.060
It's like bill bill clinton being introduced to sam sam sam sam was the

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.420
Help create the simpsons of oh, I love the simpsons

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.620
Wait wait was camille there too

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:05.060
Oh, oh andy andy. I love the simpsons

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:10.020
Wait, are you barney fight for bill clinton? I do not have relations with mayberry

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:16.740
They're kind of in the same impression category me and James Adomian we

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.580
You learn to categorize things

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.580
fucking

01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:26.420
So bill clinton goes I love the simpsons and then and then like somebody comes up

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:31.540
Like there's some kind of like like like like like a guy comes up and goes like

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:38.900
Mr. President, it's all right. You gotta you gotta go do the thing and then the other thing you gotta do is even more needing to be done than that

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:43.140
And uh, and it's just just a bunch of rigmarole and like like like oh

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:50.420
And and and bill clinton like uh, he's like, oh, all right. Oh, that's a lot of these people

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.540
And I guess I got

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.180
And and any what what's the what's the setup line? But let's let you guys

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.180
I

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.580
Can I just help

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:09.140
Just the setup line bill clinton's line. I know I know I know sam's punch line and he goes he goes, you know, is it

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.460
I'm so tired

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:16.900
There's nothing that happens in the white house that doesn't need my looking at and and I have to sign everything

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:21.460
I have to look and sign off and put a signature on everything

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:27.460
And and sam goes tell me about it

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:36.260
Sam flame is my favorite story is he would like season two of have we talked about this?

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:41.940
I don't know season two of simpsons where he goes to the playboy mansion. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's yeah

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:46.100
I think yeah, we yeah, we've told it. We've done 300 episodes. So

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.140
You have told it. Yeah

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:53.940
He sees he goes into the grotto sees a little blonde girl. I mean, why'd you ask?

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.820
I'm doing the fast version. Okay

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:04.660
He's he's never been invited to the playboy mansion. He sees a little young blonde girl getting fucked in the butt by a giant black

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.820
you know football player and

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:11.220
He's watching and like everyone's just taken it like it's no big deal

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:18.180
And so he lights up a cigarette and he's watching it and security runs in with the ear pieces in like the ear monitors

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.180
And they write and they go sir

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.500
You can't smoke in here

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:31.300
And then I'm sure I've told the story eight times on the show

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:38.260
Like 30 minutes later. He's outside the grotto the girl comes out naked rubbing her butt like kind of in pain

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.300
and she goes

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.700
What was the name of this club again?

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:49.780
And I asked Sam like what was her line reading like like because I want to call my friends up or fuck this place

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.780
like get me the phone and he goes

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.980
Her line reading was kind of like who needs this

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:04.420
So, uh, I like like like like now he's dead

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.820
Third act of this is like sort of like

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.780
I told you backstick because I was I was like

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.180
I did like like what what am I?

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:19.780
I'm a bad interviewer to you. What do you want to talk about? What do you want to talk about?

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:22.980
You're like, what do you want to talk about? I said, honestly, if I met you at a party

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:29.220
I I would start the conversation with the topic of when is when is it enough what like when is enough enough?

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:34.180
and and and what does that mean and and because it circles these areas of like

01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:38.820
The fraud complex we've dealt with that's the road of trials

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:43.940
And I we don't need to be hooked up to a polygraph and I don't I can ask you a thousand times

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:48.180
Do you have a fraud complex and you can either say yes or no and we'll never really understand

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:53.860
Like like do you really like do you look in the mirror when you go home at night and go chud apatow?

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.020
Who are you kidding?

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.740
Uh, like we I had this conversation with my psychic yesterday

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:05.540
Honestly, I was talking to psychic. Would you psychic by psychic would you recommend them?

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:08.660
Uh, it's hard to know because I was

01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:13.700
It's always hard because I got to see if the predictions work or not. So I know I need a little more time to

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.980
The psychic was good, but there was this psychic

01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:24.260
We were talking to because we occasionally like a good psychic and uh, and this woman was just wrong about everything

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:29.540
But really confident, you know, you know, so she's like you're you're you're your wife or what?

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:37.620
Uh, well, we separately, but uh, the woman was it was like you you like the classic cars. You like the classic cars like

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:41.540
You know

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:47.540
You know your your your mom's not doing well. She's she's got the Alzheimer's and like no, she's dead already

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:54.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like but she also took big swings at like really terrible things happening

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.580
You know like she doesn't you were in Katrina

01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.180
Yeah

01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.180
Yeah, there's no way to even turn that into

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.500
What a storm you've you've seen your share of storms

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:10.740
But she did say to she was you're depressed, right, right? You thought about killing yourself, right?

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:16.020
For real swings for real. Oh, yeah

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:23.540
Which you that's a fucking it's like a home run hitter if there was a psychic movie equivalent of slap shot or happy gilmore

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:28.820
So they like fuck it like like there's a and there's a prude antagonist

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.820
Psychic centrist who's like you can't read fortunes like that

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:37.700
Hey, fuck it. You you you fucked Paul Bunyan. No, I didn't well

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.580
You're gonna whoo

01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:42.580
It's in the way that she used

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:48.020
So was she was she caused that she was wrong on everything

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.500
Every single thing uh, she was wrong

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:54.580
Although I but I felt bad because I felt like she looked in my eyes and just thought like, you know

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.380
I think that those people mainly just look at you and if you're in a good mood

01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:00.740
They kind of say things that support that and if you're in a bad mood

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:05.300
They're like you you're having a hard time, aren't you and like I gave off the terrible vibe

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:11.700
That she just thought my life was trouble. She couldn't know who you were. She didn't she wasn't a big apatow fan

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:17.460
But I think she she didn't like if she knew you she would have been more like a little on point. Well, she was english

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.780
She was english

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:27.300
She that was that she was like this this is 40 isn't uh, isn't on cable yet. They're like, no it is well not here

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:34.900
Have you been to the English did the English not not like dig your movies or what why in England do they dig them?

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:42.340
Uh, I don't know. I you know, I've gone places and it never seems to catch on in a big in a big way, you know

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.340
Well, you are pretty anti-british in your uh

01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:51.940
You know, we've worked with the Russell brands and the English people and it doesn't seem to

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:58.500
Explode the whole thing. I only went to a psychic one time. I was on a road trip and I was like

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:05.780
Fun, you know go in the second. That's what everyone thinks. I no one thinks I'm severe. I'll go in a second

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:10.740
They went out, but I thought it would be an occult experience. I didn't know it'd be

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:16.420
Uh, it's like they they they she laid out some I think she did some tarot cards or maybe it was palm

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:21.940
History, I can't but but because what I remember is she was like well you're you want to do this

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:27.700
But you want to do that it was it was actually the opposite of what you're describing like no like tiny little weed wacker swings

01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:32.820
That couldn't help but be accurate. It's like you're you're you're conflicted about something related to your life

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.980
Like you're good

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:40.740
It and it was like, you know and the part of you that

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:46.180
Went in paid money is like that's the smarter move because you actually are engaging in a self

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:50.900
Inventory that could be beneficial. It could be a form of therapy, but then at the end of it

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:57.620
It's like it just turned into like this is like, you know, and you know, you've turned your back on christ and he just needs to

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:03.780
And it's just everything got christian and I'm like wait, how do you know that's been our show? Yes. Thanks for coming

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.140
How do you know I'm not muslim and aren't you a witch?

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:13.380
How are you even on this team? What do you even when I was like 10 years old?

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:15.700
I got my palm read and the woman looks at my hands. She goes

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:21.620
When you're in your late 40s, you're gonna have an injury to your right ear. I'm like give me give me this

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.860
hand back

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.660
There's this there's no way there's that many lines

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.540
Just it's fucking impossible

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:36.900
Like we went to a psychic and the psychic implied like we were about to go on vacation Hawaii and she was like

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:41.140
I'm seeing. Uh, I don't know. I'm seeing some windy roads

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:50.100
Like she was probably we're gonna die on the vacation and so we went to Hawaii and like hid in the room for 10 days

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:57.140
Until you realize it's an island every road is supposed to be windy the dangerous roads would be straight

01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:02.820
We got scared, but we proved her. I don't know if we proved her correct or not correct because we didn't die

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:08.740
Yeah, well, yeah, we also I think the same woman like I like two months later read my hand. He goes you're gonna live

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:13.540
Forever. Whoa. I'm like, whoa, but what about my fucking ear?

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:21.220
It's like you're sore or something you're gonna live forever, but you're gonna your brother's gonna take your ear

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.900
He's a giant ox. Yeah, also

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:26.580
So I've been told I'm gonna have three children. I think that ship has sailed

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:30.340
So like everything was a lie. No one's like nothing's ever been

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:36.100
Accurate about that. Are you what it's up? Let's respect our guests and give them a what a what time? Oh, look at that

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.340
See, I fucking nail. I'm so good at this show

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.020
All right, what are you plugging?

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:50.340
I thought we were I thought we were talking about when is enough enough. Oh, yeah, but look

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:54.580
Hey, Jen, can we talk about you being the host on chop jr. For the next year seasons?

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:59.940
Yeah, I know. Well, do you have fantasies of retirement? Do you have plans? Uh, well

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:03.940
This is dan asking about whether or not he's allowed to retire. Yeah

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:08.100
Do you do you think about in retiring? Like do you think uh, like why do you still do it?

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.860
because

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:17.140
It's it's always been for the money and I hate everyone and they've always hated me and I arrived alone

01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:21.460
And I'm leaving likewise and and and they've been hurtful and they're gonna miss me when I'm gone

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:32.100
And I and and to prove it I just test drove a tesla yesterday on sunday

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:34.420
Dan, sorry. Did you have to cut you off for a second?

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.020
Hold your father. Dan, you're never gonna fucking retire because your your

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:44.260
Identity is based on your output. Like you you want to be

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:50.820
Liked and and to be in the mix like you what you're gonna fuck tell them Judd. Tell them

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:55.220
No, Dan, you tell me you really how much money have you made?

01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:00.020
Well, I can am I allowed to count the

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:04.740
Money am I gonna make? Yeah, okay, like hundreds of millions

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:10.100
If you can't count it, but you haven't Judd

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:16.260
Judd, ten dollars. Are you like are you like Judd? What's his name Ryan Murphy? Are you uh, you have a Ryan Murphy deal?

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.900
I yes

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:25.380
Probably Judd, you and I have just met I I can guarantee you having known Dan for a long long long time

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:30.980
He's never going to retire because his identity is too built into the work

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:37.460
He you you want to create and you want people to like the things that you judge. Do you think based on your storyteller?

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:42.420
Uh, is this the character in the movie that is the good friend or the

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:48.740
Is this the drinking buddy that doesn't want you to get married or

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.460
did like

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:56.340
If you went off the air Dan if you went off the air and didn't have a tv show didn't have a movie coming out

01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:58.420
Didn't have a podcast. I moved to Montana

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:04.020
Yeah, you'd be happy just moving to the hills and completely switching off

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:09.460
I wouldn't take it that extreme. I mean like Larry Sanders in that in that season like he's a very resonant thing

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.940
He has this fantasy. It's like I'm going to go to a cabin in Montana

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.660
It just becomes this mantra and then like the season ends with

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.340
like

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.180
Like there's the cabin. He's in Montana. It's just like it's quiet. He's like

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:29.860
But I wouldn't I don't I don't make the mistake of thinking that I don't love attention and that I don't need to feel

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:35.620
The admiration of strangers and all this stuff. Well, I I simply like I

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:38.980
I'm pretty confident that I mean it when I say

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:45.220
I would love to wake up one morning and ask myself the question. What do I want to do?

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:49.700
Because you're burdened. I have to there's too much to do

01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:55.700
To get all the work done. Yeah, and I think I got not have a deadline not have a couple little dumb movies

01:17:55.700 --> 01:18:00.820
Like the kind that that that got you your start and the kind that go Schrab, and I did channel 101

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:04.500
It was like these are the happiest times of our lives when we were in our 20s

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:08.740
And we made these like dumb things and yeah, you make them now you put them on instagram

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:14.260
And you just like 40 Nazis go stop talking about politics. I don't I don't but who cares about them

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.260
It's not for them. I just want to watch them burn

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:24.660
It's it's it's like it's like the fulfillment like I'll make a little song and I'll go like that feels nice

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:27.940
I think that's the expression on my dad's face when he works on stained glass

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:32.500
He's like my dad doesn't go. I can't stand not working on vhs duplication anymore

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:40.100
My dad doesn't have to be good or bad or lying or honest in order to be like I prefer working on stained glass

01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:42.980
He's really bad at it. Like I hope my dad

01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:49.060
He makes terrible stained glass. Is he a fan of the show? Should we not talk about that? I don't I don't think so

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:52.100
I think because I think in the 300 episodes of this show

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:58.820
I think even just as an aggregate we probably provided tutelage in making stained glass better than he's made

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.220
on accident

01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:03.220
Okay. Well, all right

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:07.460
It's the reason you groaned is because the joke was poorly constructed

01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:10.580
It's not because it was like a low blow

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:15.380
You're groaning because you're like all of that for that just to say your dad's shitty

01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:22.260
Judd, how about you? Are you going to be the kind of person that wants to retire soon or work to you? They put you in the dirt

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:26.500
No, I just uh, sometimes I think the things that uh

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:33.140
Are smaller are less pressure and more fun. Like it was really uh enjoyable to

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.020
You know work on the documentary

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:40.260
I made a documentary about the avid brothers and about daniel strober and white gooden

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:43.940
And I find that I'm getting more and more joy out of the things I don't get paid for

01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:46.340
Have you been able to find some place where you don't?

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:51.380
Like your what is your relationship with people's opinion of you?

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:57.540
Yeah, like like like like so because how do you because I'm only to the place where I can go

01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:03.220
Oh, fuck them. That's the healthiest I can get. Yeah, but even the ones who like you

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:05.780
No, no, no not fuck them. No

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:12.980
A thousand camels for that for their children. I I I no I just mean like like it's it's it's like oh

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:17.060
Uh, that relationship can hurt me. Yeah, so fuck it

01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:23.700
Yeah, but you you're about to tell me how to get a relationship where you're like, actually it's okay for them to say

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:30.420
Fuck you. Judd Apatow. You straight white fucking privileged pieces. Shit. It's never fucking, but I fuck you and you

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:34.580
Hacky bullshit. Oh, it's a would you're on every billboard because you're a piece of shit

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:40.500
Fuck you and like and that and that you're you're able to go like hey Judd you're allowed to leave whenever you are

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:47.380
Yeah, but like you you but you feel there's like there's like a debate on the work that's happening that there's some people love it

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.540
And there's some people who yeah

01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:52.020
Engaging with you and attacking you for different

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:57.540
There's not even a debate on the work like, uh, maybe this is like like like it's like, oh the work's great

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:03.300
Is it ever going to make this guy a good person? Yeah, why do you think you're a bad person? I'm a bad person

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.940
Yeah, but why are you a bad person?

01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.900
well, ironically, uh

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:14.420
A lot of it should happen. I just called you a bad person. I want that to go on record

01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:18.660
I would like to think ironically it's because well, I had work to do

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.420
You had work to do and that made you a bad person. Yeah, I did what my work wasn't in the area of

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.340
Being a good person

01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:31.140
That you were focusing on your own ego and your own success

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:36.660
And not helping anybody if somebody came up and said like hey, can you help me open this soda? I'd be like

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:38.740
uh

01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:41.380
How is that going to make television good? Yeah

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:46.820
So they go we're eight and I'm like well, bitch you better fucking figure it out

01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:52.020
Yeah, because I'm going to be controlling tv one day and you're going to be open in sodas. Yeah

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:57.940
And as you compound that for 40 years, but it's like is there a difference between our breed?

01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.780
Are you are you and are you a you're a you're a you're a

01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:04.420
More likable person, right? Like you're

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:10.580
Like I think this crowd likes you more than me. So you're wrong. They're self abusive

01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:15.540
So yes, you're right. They do but they because they've they they conflate

01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:22.260
Loathing with authenticity and so then they're like, I like them because he hates himself. That gives me a break from hating myself

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:24.900
It's terrible. We're all unhealthy. I see

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:31.060
That's true. But that's why we have guests like you to invite us upward and so I think we're all asking you

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:34.500
Do you have a secret? Can we escape this?

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:38.980
Well, I used to be I think I used to have a lot more of your energy

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:44.900
Early in my career because I remember I was working on the bedsteller show and they gave me all these terrible notes

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:50.180
And I said to the guy I said, uh, well, I'm not doing any of them. What happens now?

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.460
Yeah

01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.860
And then we got cancelled

01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:00.420
Uh, and I did this and you won an Emmy

01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:03.220
And then I did the same thing on a freezer geek. So we got cancelled

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:07.380
I did the same thing on undeclared. We got cancelled and then I made this pilot with the great Dave Herman

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:12.580
you know from office space and king of the hill and he had a beard he played a pearl officer and

01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:16.260
The the head of the network said, uh, I want you to reshoot

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:18.260
We were three days into shooting the pilot

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:24.740
I I want you to reshoot everything because I don't like the beard because only uh villains and pirates have beers

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:29.940
And so then the head of the production company came to me and said you can you do this?

01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.300
Will you reshoot everything you've done?

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:34.020
But we have been like improvising for three days like you couldn't really

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:38.980
Recreate what had happened and he looked better with the beard as a kind of a grizzled guy

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:42.100
And I said I don't think I can do it

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:47.620
Like I don't think that it will be better without the beard and she said if you don't shave the beard

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:51.860
There's no chance this show will get picked up

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:54.580
I'm like really like she will hold that against me

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:57.220
Uh, like she begged me to make a show

01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:01.220
But she will hold it against me and not pick it up only because of the beard. She said yes

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:05.620
And I'm like, well, I'm not shaving the beard and uh, and then they didn't pick up the show

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.460
So I have had Dan Harmon years

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.580
Like keep going. I was like wait

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:16.180
Was there a dead man's curve or you're like, I can't do it

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:19.380
There was there wasn't that man's curve

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.980
Which is I was working on the 40-year-old virgin and uh, I was like again

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:26.820
I was like three days in we had only shot two things we shot

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:31.300
He was like remember where there was like a bus that had all this like sexy signs on it

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:35.300
And he was just running away from this bus with with a perfume ad on the side

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:39.620
And um, so we shot that and then we shot this speed dating sequence

01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:43.460
You know and the studio saw it and then someone from the studio

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:48.260
You know in the middle of the day called and said shut the movie down

01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:52.020
And they said, you know, Steve looks like a serial killer

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:55.380
And Paul Rudd looks fat

01:24:55.780 --> 01:25:01.300
And you're lighting it like an indie, but it also felt like they didn't really understand the the style

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.860
comedically of what we were doing

01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:10.340
And that was usually the moment where I would like, you know burn everything down and and we wouldn't start up again

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:14.420
And for the first time in my career, I went, okay, I'm gonna listen

01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:18.420
To everything they say because someone said to me when you

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:21.220
Would you tell people their notes are stupid

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:26.100
You're basically calling them stupid and then they make it their mission to destroy you

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:30.100
But that's their reaction. This is all in the masterclass by the way

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:36.340
And and uh, and so I said don't just don't do it just listen to the notes

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:42.500
Just don't maybe there's a way to do the notes and so she's like well he looks like a serial killer and I said well

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:47.060
He's wearing like a tan like Jeffrey Dahmer jacket all the time

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:50.500
And I said, well, we probably could make that maybe like a running gag that everyone tells him

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:55.620
He's looking like a serial killer. That's good. I like that and and then we did that and it became a big part of the story

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:57.620
Hang a lantern on it. We call that

01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:58.980
Yeah

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:02.660
I mean don't address the note you make the note part of the script

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:08.580
I actually made up a comedy term that no one uses which is a certain joke is a turd in a slipper

01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:14.340
A slipper a turd in a slipper which basically means like you like you put your foot in a

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.300
In a slipper with a turd in it and it's a joke that feels good, but it's not right

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.940
If this episode is not called turd in a slipper I quit

01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:31.940
I

01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:37.700
But then I couldn't I couldn't make Paul run skinnier because I wanted run to be to be fat

01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:42.020
You know like I thought you know, he was always so cute and like clueless and I was always like

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:45.460
I like him like when he looks like he's falling apart and

01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:53.060
And so I said i'm gonna make paul lose weight, but it was too late, you know, you wanted you wanted to poop in his slipper

01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:59.060
And then uh, you know the lighting is the lighting and then I realized like oh, this didn't even make sense

01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:04.980
Shutting us down like she could have just called and said hey keep an eye on these three things

01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:10.340
That happens a lot where like an email will come in and it's like

01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:19.700
Their choice to make it seem catastrophic and so their language is catastrophic and so you inherit that and then you go

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:23.540
Well, then defiance is the only I'm just beating that horse

01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:26.580
But it's like that that is why it's worth like breathing and going

01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:30.740
What's the note behind the note? How do you actually do this? Like let them be hysterical

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:36.180
And I go like actually this is this is as most notes is addressable

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.300
Yeah

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:40.900
And the way to be defiant is to prove that that serves your ego

01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:45.300
It go like actually you guys think it's hard to make him not look like a serial killer

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.460
All you had to say is please

01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:52.580
Yeah, and and you like you can retain your ego and you're but it's so hard because when they give you the notes

01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.820
What you're thinking is

01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:57.940
And it's because it's because that's linked to

01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:01.220
The presupposition

01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:08.580
That you didn't you don't know what you're doing. Yes. It has to be because if you really knew when you really have confidence, isn't your

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:14.740
It's like actually dumb shit saying like are you sure this should be a thing? Yeah

01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:20.980
Like isn't it kind of like I was like do you want us to engage in the humiliating ritual of changing it for you?

01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:26.420
Like you're kind of like you have that like power that Harry Potter scar in your head

01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:32.180
I think for me it was I like for me the reason why I'm also that confident. It's no I'm not I

01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:35.780
But but I just realized I don't know if maybe

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.740
Was that moment did that coincide with you?

01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:44.580
A relationship that you're in your personal life a daughter born or a

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:50.020
A wife married that you're like I gotta stop making bridges out of firewood

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:52.340
Well, I you know, I had a I had a realization

01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:59.780
Uh, which is okay anything something anytime something would happen like with the show or even a scene or anything going wrong

01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:05.780
I would just lose my shit and my wife would always make fun of me and and just you know

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:10.020
Just be like oh nightmare on the set nightmare on the set like mock me

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.900
You know meltdown on the set. What will you do?

01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:20.020
And and she just so laughed at me for the fact that I would go to 10 on things that weren't that important

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:24.340
And and I made a connection at one point. I was in this giant fight

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:30.420
I wanted to direct uh this the pilot that with Dave Herman. I couldn't get them to let me direct it

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:37.140
They they said no and I was just losing my shit and I realized that I was treating the head of the network

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:39.940
like my mother

01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:45.620
And that I was uh looking to there were two heads of the network at fox

01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:50.900
I think they were like my mom and dad getting divorced and that I had the energy

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.460
Of like a 14 year old

01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:57.540
Fucking flipping out with them and I'm like this isn't what's happening

01:29:57.860 --> 01:29:59.860
I have different energy than what's actually

01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:04.420
Going wrong here and as soon as I realized I was treating the head of the network like my mother

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:07.700
I I made a choice to find people

01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:15.620
Who understood what I do and that I wouldn't be in fights if I really spent more time going what executive gets

01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:18.980
The joke right and ever since I've done that

01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:25.140
It's all easier, but you have to if the really I remember met larry galebart and larry galebart wrote the movie

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:32.660
uh neighbors the one with john belushi and uh dan acrid and he said he went out to dinner with the director and

01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:35.380
The director wasn't funny

01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:40.420
But he didn't do anything about it. He was just like he wasn't funny and then like two weeks into shooting

01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:45.940
He's like this is a disaster and he said he realized like at that moment. I got a pulpo plug on the whole thing

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.940
I have to make sure our neighbors

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:53.060
Yeah, these are the right people like if I don't if I don't have the right team around me

01:30:53.460 --> 01:31:00.500
The whole thing is screwed and so that's what I tried to do is slow down and go who really understands me, but but

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:06.500
But an argument could be made that that that guy that melts down that that's what he's trying to do

01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:12.420
He's he's trying to make the he's going this isn't right. You're not right. You don't get me this email

01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:15.940
Is you being a person that can't work with me?

01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:23.700
It so we have these stories where oh, okay, and then I rose and I breathed and I became a better collaborator

01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:27.620
But then you just undercut it right there because it's like that's just as true too

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:31.060
It's like yeah, if you don't have chemistry, how are you ever going to make anything work?

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:35.380
Yeah, the the the you didn't know you were allowed to not cast

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:41.380
Your friends in the Ben Stiller show that's that's the Emmy winning sketch show like they laughed at me when I said

01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:43.460
Let's let's have Seth Rogen

01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:46.020
Be the lead of undeclared they literally started laughing

01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:49.060
like it was so ridiculous and

01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:55.060
But I think that at some point you realize like all this energy I put into my meltdown

01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:57.780
It's not actually making anything better and it's making me sick

01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:05.540
And is there any way to just not do it only because it's it's exhausting at some point to be in that place

01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:08.660
Is there a part because like I I I'm not like a

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:13.460
An employer you got you guys have things that go on where you have

01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:18.020
100 people that work, you know with you underneath you like and you're making you know

01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:21.540
You could have fooled me with the way you're pushing this sports drink backstage

01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:24.020
I don't know. I thought I was I

01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:28.820
Just thought I'd invent some weird thing that Jeff has a sports drink company like

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.180
It didn't land

01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:35.700
How is he famous jet? How is

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:38.820
Between you and me why is that even here?

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.380
I know but uh like

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:42.740
when you're

01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:48.180
Like in a creative space and you have all these people underneath you that are reliant upon you

01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:55.060
How much does that weigh into your like daily decision-making at all or not a bit?

01:32:55.860 --> 01:33:00.100
Well, it depends on the project because sometimes, you know, you're working with people and you go

01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:02.260
This is their big break

01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:04.260
Like so if I fuck this up

01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:06.340
Amy Schumer is screwed

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:09.540
She's not gonna get she's not gonna get another movie. I gotta do a good job

01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:13.140
I'm gonna really hurt her long-term prospects and I think about it

01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:20.660
But it's worse when I work with my kids because I just think I'm gonna make my children a laughing stock around the world

01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:26.500
Also, there's wardrobe people the makeup department and all these like grips and carpenters and all this stuff

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.820
I was I was kind of happy about one aspect of the rosean thing

01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:35.300
Which was that actually for the first time in mainstream media talking about the television industry

01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:39.060
There was a big talking point that was 200 people lost their jobs

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:44.100
Yeah, and and and I'm not saying. Oh, that was a great talking point or as bad

01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:51.940
It's like we'd never really talk about that and also it's not always true every day that sony came to a table read on community

01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:58.580
Their theme was actually you're fucking 200 people over with your shitty late

01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:02.660
Crazy Dungeons & Dragons scripts. That's why I kept saying to them

01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:10.100
You know, you can always fire me and all these guys that saw wood and haul cable be as safe in your fucking loving arms as you want

01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:17.540
It kind of like it sometimes that fraud complex goes. I'm actually I need to get out of here to save

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:22.500
people hauling cable, but do you think I know this sounds weird, but

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:25.780
Everyone in show business is in the circus

01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:32.980
So if this isn't like people have been working at Ford for 25 years and the show goes down and they never get a job again

01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:35.620
They all just jump on another fucking Hulu show

01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:41.220
Yeah, I mean like it sucks, but you might have three or four bad months

01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:44.820
That's if they're lucky, but I think that a lot of people is like

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:48.020
Like when somebody like when Kevin Spacey

01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:53.300
gets Kevin Spacey and the house of house of cards just dies

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.300
There's some

01:34:55.620 --> 01:35:02.900
Probably 150 people that said oh fuck. I just got hired like I thought I had a no it definitely sucks

01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:06.100
I mean it definitely sucks. It's it's awful

01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:12.260
But you know only shows are like eight episodes or 10 episodes and there's so much demand

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:16.980
For crews for shows that like the the biggest part of it

01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:21.620
I mean you know who gets screwed is like certain actors or actresses they can only work on that show

01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:28.020
You know there are certain people on rosanne. You go. This is where they're gonna score in this show

01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:35.140
You know, I guess my question wasn't so much about the like the the grand picture of laury met calf being out of a job

01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:41.140
It's it's the fact that like when you're writing an episode fighting with the network fighting with the studio

01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:44.100
Having your own little like tug of war

01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:47.700
How much do you think about the fact that you're

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:53.540
That you're in charge of a lot of people. Well, I only think about it in the sense that there's a big crew

01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:57.860
And I and this sounds like bullshit, but I really think I you know

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:01.380
I'd like this all to work well for them so that they all feel respected

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:06.820
If anything goes gets weird they can come to me and it will be dealt with and that like we're like a happy

01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:11.620
Family that's not a big burden on you as you're doing the creative. It's not hard to do. It's it's not hard

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:17.780
To be pleasant and right nice to the people who work for you like the people who who are a nightmare

01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:21.620
It requires more energy. How much time like like how many

01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:28.420
sets crews like shows have you been on where it was a fucking nightmare because like I've been very lucky

01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:34.340
To work in comedy where everybody's nice. Yeah, and only maybe one or two times people were shitty

01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:38.820
But that's like really rare like yeah, I haven't had a lot of those experiences

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:43.460
I think a director can be shitty and be yelling at the crew and yelling at the dolly grip

01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:48.100
That they they miss the mark like you do see that like somebody who is so obsessed with doing a good job

01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:54.020
They're mean to people around them, but I think everyone has bad days where they do that

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:59.380
Are you do you think you're good at cultivating like an environment of happiness and fun and grievous?

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:01.380
I'm the least fun person on the set

01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:07.620
I'm not fun. I you know like like I don't know how you are like, you know when you're working on episodes and you're on set

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:13.860
I am so nervous that the day is not going well that my main thought is

01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:18.020
I need to figure out a way to seem like I'm in an okay mood

01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:22.100
For everyone around me because what's in my head is uh, so

01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:24.340
But that's good. You like I find myself

01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:30.340
I I get so easily fixated on what they're doing that and then I over time over a couple of seasons

01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:34.980
I I objectively noticed because I love being in the edit bay and

01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:36.980
uh, I

01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:42.740
And I love being in the writer's room and then I would sometimes go to the set where they're shooting the things that you wrote in the writer's room

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:47.860
That you labor over and then that you're gonna have to edit and what I would notice is that me on the set

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:51.140
was like you you might as well throw a

01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:54.260
Bucket of chicken bones in the air and

01:37:54.820 --> 01:38:01.220
And adjust the set the way the chicken bones implied because because it was basically like it's like

01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:06.420
Like yeah, sometimes the chicken bones are gonna be right sometimes raw. I was like like outside of like any but it's like

01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:08.420
I'm not my instincts for

01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:11.620
For actors and how to communicate with them like

01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:16.500
Yeah, might as well roll the dice. Well, I agree with Ed to a point

01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:18.820
I I

01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:22.420
You know when the show's going well, you know, we're shooting crashing right now. We have great directors

01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:24.660
I don't feel like when I sit on the set

01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:26.820
Uh, it's essential

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:30.500
To what's happening and you know, I'm always thrilled when an episode comes in and it's

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:37.220
It's incredible and I can go I was not there for one second. Yeah, I felt that funny people like I had that

01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:39.540
You know, and I was like

01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:45.540
Judd's Judd's got his ass plopped in this director's chair. It's like we're burning money here. He could be off developing something

01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:47.700
I got this

01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:51.300
Uh, but but but yeah, I is that the only time you've worked at the Anish Kaminsky

01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.540
Uh

01:38:53.540 --> 01:39:02.020
Wait, I don't know what that's a cinematographer who did the funny people. Oh and Lincoln. Why are they always, uh,

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:04.420
Polish? Yeah

01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:08.020
Well, I guess polish was it like they're always like some

01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:11.860
They smoke cigarettes with their hand back

01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:15.940
Like why are they always from some strange land?

01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:23.940
He came to america and the he's the you know, he's one of the best ever and the first movie he did was uh, the vanilla ice movie cool as ice

01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:28.020
That's how he started from my money holds up. Yeah. Yeah

01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:33.860
Cool as ice is fucking like it's still it's still as true as it was the day it was made

01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:37.780
Is there any way I hate I I hate this question

01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:40.500
I always like like we've connected with you

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:48.980
You're at the you're at the top of the tornado, which means you're either gonna be flung off and be a cautionary tale of the velocity of a human body or

01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:51.940
Or end up somewhere random

01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:55.380
Like what part is the best part of the tornado to be in top?

01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:00.180
Top center and then you like end up like it's like like Ripley's believe or not

01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:05.940
Judd Apatow was in Kansas when this tornado sucked him up. He ended up sitting in hawaii happily married

01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.140
As opposed to like, whoa fucking

01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:10.500
Wow

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:15.940
Which is what the but but like so far so good. Yeah, you're doing all right. Yeah

01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:23.860
You started like scrapping and wanting and you've been transparent about it. Like there's

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:29.620
190 people in here some of them are surely bad people some of them are good people

01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:32.260
Uh, a lot of them

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:35.060
You guys are all good people

01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:43.620
Is there is there is there any way to like like like like after all of these decades of you with these these roller coasters like

01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:47.300
It's dumb. It's like that's what they always want. What's your advice to young people?

01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:52.100
Well, what is it, you know

01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:55.220
You know, what is the advice to young people?

01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:59.540
It could take the form of like a more practical way of asking it because it might get a more sincere answer

01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:03.060
Is what do you wish what do you wish you could poke your head through a doctor strange hole and say

01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:06.420
What's your advice to Dan Harmon so he's not so freaked out right now?

01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:11.140
No, what do you wish you could say to yourself pick an age? I mean if you want to pick 17

01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:14.500
Well, I think you know the one thing that I got out of uh

01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:17.540
being around gary was

01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:23.460
Because I never thought about any of the things that he talked about before meeting him in terms of you right from a

01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:27.460
Personal place you're trying to learn who you are through your creativity

01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.180
You know, he was a guy who didn't uh

01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:34.820
He wasn't really part of the system like he made these shows, but he didn't seem like he was uh

01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:39.460
A part of show business, you know, like he just did his things on the side

01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:45.780
And he was almost like an independent filmmaker in doing his tv shows and I think there's a lot to be said for

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:47.620
uh

01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:50.980
caring that passionately about whatever you're doing and

01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:56.100
Being willing to dig deep and then if you have something to say people might connect with it

01:41:56.100 --> 01:42:00.260
You can't really succeed if you're just trying to be a cog in the machine

01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:06.340
You're really trying to figure out what you want to express to other people and I you know

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:11.140
For me in a very simple way. I think I'm over and over just trying to say, you know

01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:14.580
Don't be an asshole try to be nicer try to grow

01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:19.940
Uh and that every movie is like a fucking idiot trying to be less of a fucking idiot, you know

01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:23.620
And that's all it is and I'll I'll think I'm reinventing the wheel and I'll sit in a story meeting

01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:27.060
And then by the end of the meeting we've kind of cracked the story and I'm like, yeah

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:30.180
It's just another version of that and that's what it is

01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:34.980
Do you notice that in your work like there's a common theme that no matter how hard you try to get away from it

01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:37.060
You're landing on it again

01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:39.300
No

01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:46.980
What are your themes do you have any judgment dealing with uh being brilliant, uh

01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:55.220
Uh, no, I I think control is it's it's like it's like it's sort of like every episode of community in rick and moody

01:42:55.300 --> 01:43:00.340
Like it's so easy for it to come around to oh, we're talking about control versus not control

01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:03.460
And it always makes me feel like right. Are we doing this right or wrong?

01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:07.940
Is every story about the human ambition for control or are we fucking up?

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:12.340
Are we just like going back to a golf swing that is basically like killing our shoulder?

01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:16.820
Or like like are we supposed to be different than this? Are we supposed to be telling stories about fucking whoo?

01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:21.460
What happened to you that you're obsessed with the idea of control?

01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:25.700
This is a whole different show

01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:31.620
Because I've never heard anyone talk about that as a theme, but I'm fascinated by how it works

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:39.300
Well, because I'm terrified of being a control freak. It's like like like more so than I it's it feels like I'm a control freak

01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:44.500
I feel like control freaks worry about not having control and I find myself waking up every day and going

01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:49.060
I'm I'm terrified. I'm gonna be a control freak. I see but we don't have come on

01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:55.060
Everybody's a control freak. It's just like how you carry it. Like I'm sure there's no difference between how I'm controlling things

01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:59.220
Now you're controlling things. It's just how we're acting around the office. Yes

01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:08.580
Yes, and we that brings us to Twitter and this new age where it's like, oh, I'm like has any of this become cash-innable?

01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:11.540
Like like

01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.500
Is the common man

01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:17.220
Or lady

01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:19.860
You can be common

01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:27.140
Are they are can I can I finish like can it can they say

01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.140
You're all right. You did it

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:31.060
but

01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:38.580
But not mean you did it like you made three branded content videos that want to Chloe

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:40.660
It's like you

01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:43.780
You meaning like no because you did all that stuff

01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:47.780
All right, you're not gross anymore. Like you're not like

01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:51.300
Like I I touch your hand in square dancing

01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:59.700
Like I like like I wouldn't it's not that's not saying I date you but I wouldn't like I wouldn't I wouldn't go to the cafeteria and

01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:03.940
and and and say I can't believe I had

01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:09.700
That getting a fied credit required touching that person. Yeah, can you can you?

01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:13.860
Can you ever take the journey that would like can you undo that?

01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:16.980
Can you be less gross by making shit?

01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:19.940
That's interesting

01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:24.340
I think you hate yourself in a different way than I hate myself

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:29.060
All right, that's no, I wasn't even I was just kidding

01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:38.500
Uh

01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:45.860
How much self-loving goes into being a great like show creator like like like

01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:50.340
Do you do you feel like a little bit of self-loving is a part of what you make?

01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:51.780
Jen

01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:53.780
I you know, I think I got lucky

01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:56.580
You know, you know, I see my career in two phases

01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:59.620
Which is I had all these shows cancelled and I felt like they were good

01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:03.780
And I had movies that didn't do well like cable guy and heavy weights that I liked

01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:07.540
And I was like I think I'm out of sync with the world like the things that I like

01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:10.820
I think they are good, but I don't think I guess I'm never going to

01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:16.500
Transcend and like connect with the audience and then I you know was lucky enough to be Paul Fegan

01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:18.660
We worked on freaks and geeks and then when that was over

01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:25.380
I had a very visceral sense that something magical had happened like this is weird like this came out

01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:28.820
Exactly the way we wanted to do it before the public

01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:33.620
Reactive or was it it almost disconnected from the reaction of the audience?

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:37.140
It was just a personal feeling like I think for me

01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:42.980
This is as good as I can do and I think it works perfectly the way we wanted it to

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:48.500
And as a result, I'm going to look at the rest of my career as like an aftermath

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:54.340
And so like, you know, it's almost like a trick on myself like I did it once

01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:59.540
So I could take all that pressure off of myself and just try a bunch of shit

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:04.500
Because I really only wanted to prove to myself once that I knew what I was doing

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:07.140
And that everything else can be an experiment

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:12.420
So identify the top of your apatowr

01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:17.380
No, that didn't work

01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:20.980
Does that make any sense?

01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:23.700
Uh the connection of apatowr and then the word door

01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:26.580
A little too much

01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:32.420
No, I did I Joel Hodgson came to an epiphany, you know Joel

01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:39.300
Yes, yes like about mystery science theater like he had a love-hate relationship with it because of what it represented in his life

01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:42.260
And so he kind of you you got lucky enough to

01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:48.020
Sounds like you're in the edit band freaks and geeks and you're like, you know what if I think it's going to get better than this

01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:52.660
Um, I I may be right. I may be wrong, but one thing's for certain

01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:57.060
I have unreasonable expectations if I compare that's how I feel about rick and morty

01:47:57.060 --> 01:48:04.740
Yeah, it's like I'm like I I community was fucking perfect. Therefore like I really like rick and morty. I'm like

01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:07.300
if you ever

01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:09.380
expect to be this

01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:12.260
happy about something you've made like

01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:14.980
Like you're dumb

01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:22.020
And that doesn't mean you're not going to and it doesn't mean you you are it's but it's like it's it's that it is that atoning with like

01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:24.580
Good enough is good enough. Yeah

01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:28.980
Um, or just not even good enough just I'm giving myself to it

01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:31.940
I'm being as creative as I can be and I have the courage to

01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:36.260
Put that out there and we'll see what it is. Like I'm not holding back

01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:39.460
I'm not trying to obsess on how people are going to feel about it

01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:45.060
It's a pure expression because you're not you're not letting yourself be defined. Hi. Sorry. That happens a lot

01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:48.340
I'm hidden

01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:54.340
But you find yourself like you're you're taking the pressure off yourself and you're not letting yourself be defined by your work

01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:59.540
So in that sense, it's not about your ego. It's really just about focusing on the thing that you're doing

01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:04.340
Can you get to that place right and then but there's always that other party that's like I'm gross

01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:08.580
You know, you're aware that we carry with us trying to let the dominant thing be

01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:15.300
I'm going to try to be in flow on whatever this creative expression is and put it out there and whatever whatever

01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:22.020
Yeah, I mean it's not it's not fair to people to to like it's like a writer and a contract with the audience inside

01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:24.980
Okay. Oh, do you like that show mighty mouse? Yeah, it's great

01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:29.380
Uh, hey, did you know the guy that created it wants you to think that he's a good person?

01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:31.780
Well, I don't know like I don't know

01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:34.820
I'm not prepared to have that conversation

01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:42.020
Um, I'm what I'm very prepared to tell you is that I enjoyed mighty mouse episode three yesterday

01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:45.620
And may change my mind tomorrow and have a full fucking right to

01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:50.900
Yeah, it's like that's the I think that lesson I just learned tonight and it was embarrassing

01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:55.060
Yeah, but that's like the fuel like your fuel to do the work sometimes is

01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:58.740
I'm gross. Are we boring you? He just yawned

01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:01.780
Oh, yeah, that's all right. No, but that's like your fuel

01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:06.820
Like you can't do the work unless you have some like insane wound

01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:11.700
You're trying to like overcompensate for and so the real question is at a certain age

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:18.740
Could you go I can find a different fuel than this weird insecurity self-agent and do it from a different place

01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:24.820
Yeah, yeah, I mean the metaphors there would be it could include like aerospace where it's like it takes a different form of propulsion to get

01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:30.900
Like, you know to certain places and that's like things need to detach and take over or you're a bad rocket

01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:33.940
Like if you're flying on fucking diesel to the moon

01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:39.460
Um, how does how does dan get as mellow as you?

01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:46.420
Wait, how how what could what could he learn from you how to be well your worst nightmare needs to become a reality

01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:48.420
for that to happen

01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:52.180
Because every seat's filled in here because of my mania

01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:55.780
Go ahead. You can tell him go ahead. Tell him

01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:01.300
What would it take to make me I'm just saying calm the fuck down motherfucker

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:06.180
I'm not the one I've been I've been like they haven't we done too much show like

01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:15.220
I thought I was the work do you think you're in uh, pre crazy prime crazy or post crazy

01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:19.940
It's just like right at the tip of the apatow are like I'm I'm

01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:25.700
Like I I feel like I I'm like I'm like right at the place which isn't it's like

01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:32.180
My therapist said to me she goes because she goes I describe a host of Georgia 70 episodes, whatever

01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:38.580
I I I walked her through the merch. I said I mentioned three times in my gq article

01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:39.940
um

01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:41.940
And she and she goes so

01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:44.740
Next is happiness, huh?

01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:48.580
And and and and I go yeah for sure pretty cool, right and she's like

01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:51.620
Huh

01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:53.940
No, this will be interesting. This will be interesting

01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:59.060
And and and I'm like what's that about and she goes no no no

01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:04.100
I just I'm saying it's going to be interesting because you're an archetype

01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:07.460
And uh about half of you

01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:14.260
That's true you now you become happy and now you just actually just grow to your

01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:20.180
Randomly a lot at age and you just die with a smile on your face or or or with a look of shock because maybe it's a bus

01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:27.380
But but but the other half to the point where you could flip a coin and she's like very convincing

01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:30.980
I don't know. Maybe she's bullshitting with this stuff, but she's like she makes it sound like science

01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:34.100
She's like the archetype you are in this situation. You're in the

01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:36.340
half of you

01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:38.340
Uh now you die

01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:42.420
Now you put on slippers as she said and you drink yourself to death

01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:45.700
Because you don't know how to process happiness

01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:48.740
And I was like all right

01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:53.780
