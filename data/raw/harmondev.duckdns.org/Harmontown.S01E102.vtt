Hello Hollywood!

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Hollywood, California!

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Meltdown Comics!

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
There's no theater!

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Sing it Freddie.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Guess what everybody?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Thank you.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
A weird thing happened there because I heard cheering and I was preoccupied and I was like,

01:02.000 --> 01:11.000
we're relaxed now, we've done a lot of these shows so I was just coming in and I thought for a second because I heard cheering and then I heard silence.

01:11.000 --> 01:20.000
And then I looked and I thought I ran up halfway because I thought you had introduced me and I was lagging.

01:20.000 --> 01:29.000
And then I came up halfway and froze like a rabbit and then you finished introducing me during which I kind of slinked back like a cobra.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
And then I sprang up.

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
It was the podcast introduction equivalent of two guys in the men's room doorway when you're kind of like, you don't know.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Normally I try to keep the thing rolling and you know logically when it's time for you to come up.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
I was moved by a queen musical interlude to pause for a moment.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Ah, see, yeah.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Or as they say in music, I went tacit.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
Jeff, you know how the people have the, what would Jesus do?

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
It's a question they ask themselves, keep some on point in a Christian sense.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
What would Jesus do?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
It's a yardstick.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
It's a guideline.

02:12.000 --> 02:26.000
I have, I decided today this morning my, my, I have a new Twitter guideline, which is why is Tony Danza following me?

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
And how do I make that keep happening?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
How long has he been following you?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
I'm not sure.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I don't know if there's a, was there a way to know that?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Can you date stamp when somebody started following you?

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah, that sounds like an invasion of privacy that I, I don't think this society would put up with.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Well, but how do you use why is Tony Danza following me as a yardstick of morality?

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Because, because, because it's, it's, it's, you know how when you're in an argument, you should, you should stop and take deep breaths.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Oh.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Breath start.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
It's like letting your auto now, whatever shit you're in, just step back and imagine Tony Danza's watching.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
For me, maybe it's a different person for you guys.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
Like it's, it's just like, it's not because I'm afraid of letting Tony Danza down, but it's, but I also don't have contempt for him.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
So it's like, he's kind of like the ultimate stranger, the ultimate boss.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
I'm not sure if he's the boss, but yeah, he's, I don't know.

03:26.000 --> 03:37.000
It's just the idea that Tony Danza, like I, like, oh, like it would be a nightmare for me to have Tony Danza be reading me, getting into arguments about, about, you know, political correctness or something,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
whether 17 year old or something.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
My worst, well, not my worst nightmare, but it's just like, it's a nightmare that keeps you in check.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.000
It's like Tony Danza is picking out a shirt and he's looking through his phone and he's, he's like, yeah, I don't need this.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
I mean, I think guys, I didn't buy a ticket to this ride.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
There's a possibility that like you've done something right to make Tony Danza follow you.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
And then maybe you could cross a line and do something that would make him not follow you so that you could use that as a moral compass.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
But I mean, what would, what would Tony Danza unfollow me for doing?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
That's what I'm saying.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
So anyways, I don't know.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Just give it a shot.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
See if it changes your behavior this week, but there's no control group.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
We don't know what you did that made him follow you.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
It might have been bad behavior.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
We don't know.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
And he might have been like, I like that guy.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
He's bad.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It's like me.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
There's a young Tony Danza.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
He's got, he's got spunk.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
Well, yeah, but somebody, somebody said, there's a community episode we referenced.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Who's the last?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
But he's following like a thousand 300 people.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Really?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
So he, he, he does it.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
He casts a white net.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
He's got, you know who else cast a white net?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Jesus.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Jesus.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
He's a fisherman of followers.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Yeah.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
There's that story about the two footprints and then Jesus says like that was when I was

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
checking my tumbler.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Dumb.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
That was dumb.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
But it was improvised.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
So it's allowed to be kind of dumb.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
It was so close.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
If you didn't, if you didn't back off it, it would have stood as a good joke.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Well, like if I, like if I, if I hadn't put those like Woody Allen hesitations in there,

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
I think that, I think that's the salt on my steak, which is good for me.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
I like salty steak.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
But you hesitate, you hesitate a lot.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Like if I, yeah.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
And then that's always me salting my food, like for their food, their food.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I saw, I'm putting a little pepper on it, but with my little stammers.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Like I kind of like, I'm not sure about this.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
They're premeditated.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Oh yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Everything's.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
All the time you're stammering is a huge Woody Allen construct that you have a complete

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
handle on.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
I could, I could talk about anything as if I'm totally confident in myself, but no one

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
likes that.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
That's uncarageable.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Dan, just, just, just to try it out, let's spend the next three or four minutes where

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
you never stammer.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.640
I just, even if the show should, even if the show should suffer for your, for us losing

06:05.640 --> 06:08.000
that timing and that, to show you what I mean.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I will do this for you.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
All right.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Nice and clean.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Moving on.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Can we continue with the rest of the podcast?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I would love to, Dan.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
All right.

06:16.000 --> 06:24.000
Now, moving on to our corrections section.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
This is the moment of the show when we correct things that we've done wrong, Jeff, in the

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
past.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.300
Are you implying that we've ever said anything wrong?

06:33.300 --> 06:36.080
Even things that we think we might have done wrong is worth a correction.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.000
It tells the people listening that we care.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
And by, uh, I don't mean, uh.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
You went to say like, Oh, I'm absolutely positive.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
Our first correction is, uh, this is the thing that I wanted to correct.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
Last week, Jeff, remember when I mentioned that guy that said that the podcast got him

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
through Hurricane Sandy?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yes.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.720
To me, it sounded when I listened to it as if I was rolling my eyes when I described

07:04.720 --> 07:05.720
it a little bit.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.840
Do you remember what I'm talking about?

07:06.840 --> 07:12.400
When I listened back to it, to me, it sounded as if I was mocking or ironic about how I

07:12.400 --> 07:16.160
appreciated the guy and how much he liked Harmontown and how he said it had gotten him

07:16.160 --> 07:17.600
through Hurricane Sandy.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.400
I had a certain patois in my voice.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.400
I'm sorry.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.400
I'm sorry.

07:23.400 --> 07:29.400
I said, uh, at the end of it, I said, and it got him through Hurricane Sandy.

07:29.400 --> 07:34.560
It sounded like my head was wiggling and my eyes were rolling and that was absolutely

07:34.560 --> 07:35.560
not the intention.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.040
I was very flattered by this gentleman.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.400
I spoke with him in the parking lot.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.760
I had a wonderful time with him.

07:40.760 --> 07:44.880
So wherever you are, mister, whatever your name is, I love you.

07:44.880 --> 07:45.880
What's that?

07:45.880 --> 07:46.880
Someone say something?

07:46.880 --> 07:47.880
Of course not.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.400
This is a very structured show.

07:49.400 --> 07:54.120
And so far, so far, no stutters.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.120
Yeah.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.760
And don't you think it's gotten more boring?

07:56.760 --> 07:57.760
No, no, no, no.

07:57.760 --> 07:58.760
No.

07:58.760 --> 07:59.760
Less charming?

07:59.760 --> 08:00.760
Don't you trust me less?

08:00.760 --> 08:01.760
No, no, no.

08:01.760 --> 08:02.760
It's not like Walter Franco.

08:02.760 --> 08:08.320
I actually think the show is, the show is better when it's clearer and there's more articulation.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.800
It's making me very nervous.

08:09.800 --> 08:17.080
Well, what we've created is a balloon full of tension, and the moment you stutter, it's

08:17.080 --> 08:18.080
going to be a big hit.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.080
You're letting it out.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.080
It's like a tantrum when you stutter.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.080
Oh, that was almost stutter.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.080
Oh, boy.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.080
All right.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.080
It's almost.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.080
Moving on to our next topic.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.080
Ah, yes.

08:28.080 --> 08:38.600
Is this a topic where you go back in time and talk like somebody from the 1890s?

08:38.600 --> 08:41.320
Well, this is how people talk when they're not stuttering.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.600
They talk like their words are scripted.

08:43.600 --> 08:49.000
Oh, you're on thin ice, but when you start riffing, when you start riffing.

08:49.000 --> 08:59.760
Jeff, I was very amused to have a Twitter exchange on Twitter today.

08:59.760 --> 09:04.160
In speaking about net neutrality, I threw out what I thought was a reasonable metaphor.

09:04.160 --> 09:10.080
I was trying to behoove people, god damn it.

09:10.080 --> 09:15.840
I was trying to get people to understand the importance of gatekeeping within media by

09:15.840 --> 09:30.080
using the example of pre-Lutherian Vatican endorsed Latin Bible.

09:30.080 --> 09:34.600
To be quite honest, I haven't heard a thing you said since you weren't stuttering because

09:34.600 --> 09:37.920
I'm trying to be the stutter cop right now.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.480
Well listen to what I'm saying, Jack.

09:39.480 --> 09:40.480
All right.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.480
Jeff.

09:41.480 --> 09:47.800
I reached in warning about the, you made me do that.

09:47.800 --> 09:51.280
I said in warning to, I had Max headroomed on the in warning because of what you said

09:51.280 --> 09:52.920
about counting my stutters.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.720
If I'm conscious of you counting my stutters, I'm going to stutter.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.720
Now I'm not.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.720
I let it go.

09:57.720 --> 09:58.720
All right.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.440
Now I have the song queued up.

10:00.440 --> 10:05.880
If you do stutter, there is a musical sting that might happen.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.120
I might have to speak more slowly.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.120
Take a breath.

10:09.120 --> 10:13.760
Don't tell me what to do.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.920
You see how good that felt and how good that sounded?

10:15.920 --> 10:20.640
Nobody, don't tell me what to do.

10:20.640 --> 10:26.440
When I start stuttering again, I'd like to talk about that impression and how hurtful

10:26.440 --> 10:34.320
it is, but right now I'm cool as a cucumber and know everything I'm about to say even

10:34.320 --> 10:36.640
before I say it.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.000
What did you make this as a whole show and never stuttered?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.560
It would be boring is my prediction.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.560
I see.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.560
I think not.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.560
I think that I think it would lose something.

10:43.560 --> 10:50.120
I think it would be like eating a boiled yam as opposed to a fresh crisp right out of

10:50.120 --> 10:51.120
the ground.

10:51.120 --> 11:03.840
Everyone loves a dirty, raw, wonderful, earth-nurtured yam just with the bugs still on it, pull it

11:03.840 --> 11:04.840
out of the ground.

11:04.840 --> 11:09.640
And asking the question, why did we ever boil yams?

11:09.640 --> 11:10.640
These things don't need our help.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.440
This is a hate crime, boiling this yam.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.320
This thing was perfect.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.680
God wanted this in my mouth.

11:17.680 --> 11:24.000
I can't believe he grew it in the ground.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.200
Normal people say us sometimes.

11:26.200 --> 11:30.880
We're not going to call us or stutter.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.240
We're talking about the...

11:32.240 --> 11:35.320
Dan, I'm only going to bust you on...

11:35.320 --> 11:36.320
Not bust you.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.360
I'm only going to throw the flag on the play.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.680
When it goes off the rails.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.680
When you go like...

11:40.680 --> 11:42.200
Also, I do that too.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.200
All right.

11:43.200 --> 11:50.080
Someone just laughed like that, guys, laugh as a stutter.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.720
Okay, what were we talking about?

11:52.720 --> 11:55.120
Could you please remind me?

11:55.120 --> 11:56.120
Net neutrality?

11:56.120 --> 11:57.120
Latin.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.120
Latin.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.120
Latin Bible is net neutrality.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.120
Thank you very much.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.120
You scattered people.

12:01.120 --> 12:09.120
It must be strange to be so unfocused.

12:09.120 --> 12:19.400
I bet you wish you could speak publicly, anyhow.

12:19.400 --> 12:24.800
Speaking about net neutrality on Twitter today, I used that metaphor for the dangers

12:24.800 --> 12:28.160
of gatekeeping in society.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.640
Remember when Bibles were only in Latin?

12:31.640 --> 12:33.400
Poor people couldn't know Latin.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.800
You had to access God through another class of people.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.760
I didn't think anybody thought that that was ever a good thing.

12:41.760 --> 12:49.040
This guy took exception to my comments, which I found amazing.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.040
Which guy?

12:50.040 --> 12:51.040
This guy.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.040
Just a guy.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.440
I mean, I have 250,000 followers.

12:56.440 --> 13:01.880
You'd expect that if I talked about...

13:01.880 --> 13:08.880
Braggle, brag.

13:08.880 --> 13:09.880
Excuse me, sir.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.880
My intention was not to hurt your feelings.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.240
What do you mean, which guy?

13:15.240 --> 13:25.640
Believe me, sir, the volume of my followership mitigates the quality of my life to burden

13:25.640 --> 13:27.880
I bear.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.320
Not bragging, I'm complaining.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.200
If I were to talk about papers.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.880
By trying not to stammer, you get a little British.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.960
I'm thinking about what I'm saying.

13:39.960 --> 13:44.440
Maybe get Game of Thrones or your favorite British character and see if that elongates

13:44.440 --> 13:46.080
your vowels and helps you out.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.080
Don't.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.080
Come on.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.080
I'm just trying to help.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.480
It seems like you're not trying to help.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.480
I am.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.880
No, I'm absolutely trying to help.

13:52.880 --> 13:58.560
It seems like you're Camp Mohawk in meatballs and I'm doing a teacup race.

13:58.560 --> 14:08.680
For two people, two people, a lot of gray-haired men pumping their fists right now.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.080
And by a lot, I mean two.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.080
No, no.

14:11.080 --> 14:14.640
I'm definitely the evil ski instructor right now.

14:14.640 --> 14:18.120
So you can't make it down the slope, don't?

14:18.120 --> 14:20.320
Don't frazzle me.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.880
I'm trying to help.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.160
I swear to God.

14:23.160 --> 14:35.120
This young gentleman was, to me, absurdly defensive of the Holy Roman Empire.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.720
I thought I had seen everything.

14:37.720 --> 14:44.240
We are getting dangerously close to the day and you'll call this an exaggeration.

14:44.240 --> 14:48.440
Some people will call this offensive in and of itself, but it feels as though we are getting

14:48.440 --> 14:53.720
dangerously close to the day when someone's finally once and for all going to say on the

14:53.720 --> 14:59.200
Internet, I'm sick and tired of this Hitler metaphor being a can we can just kick whatever

14:59.200 --> 15:01.560
we want.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.880
Hitler this, Hitler that, like he's just the definition of bad.

15:04.880 --> 15:10.080
How do you think that makes me feel as a Hitler lover?

15:10.080 --> 15:15.520
We're getting pretty close to that because this guy was, he was up in arms.

15:15.520 --> 15:23.760
He said, I was okay.

15:23.760 --> 15:34.760
He said, his point was that he is a Catholic churchgoer.

15:34.760 --> 15:45.360
According to his biography on Twitter, he's a polyglot glottis, what do they call themselves?

15:45.360 --> 15:46.360
A glottis.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.360
Yes.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.360
Okay.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.360
Who speaks multiple languages?

15:49.360 --> 15:50.360
Yeah.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.360
One of them being Latin.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.800
He goes to Latin mass.

15:53.800 --> 16:03.840
He's tired of this stereotype, I think, where people that speak Latin are just a bunch

16:03.840 --> 16:05.840
of assholes.

16:05.840 --> 16:12.920
And the world history idea that we all learned in world history, maybe this is an American

16:12.920 --> 16:13.920
thing.

16:13.920 --> 16:14.920
Maybe this guy lives in Frankfurt.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.920
Maybe he lives in Rome.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.320
I don't know.

16:17.320 --> 16:22.320
But it made me think, holy cow, really anything.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.640
No sooner have you conquered something than something becomes the underdog.

16:25.640 --> 16:34.640
I was kind of not realizing that I was just using the Vatican as a whipping boy because

16:34.640 --> 16:37.880
it's an easy, because I thought no one could get offended.

16:37.880 --> 16:41.760
Like, but what about people who love the Vatican?

16:41.760 --> 16:45.480
There's a million of them.

16:45.480 --> 16:48.360
There's a couple hundred million of them, I'm sure.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.880
Or a billion?

16:50.880 --> 16:53.800
Are you on the side of the Catholic Church now?

16:53.800 --> 16:59.440
I have always been on the side of anyone who wants to atone with the unknown through a

16:59.440 --> 17:00.640
religion of their choosing.

17:00.640 --> 17:05.280
I would never want to be guilty of impinging on anyone's freedom of religion.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.520
I think that's terrible.

17:06.520 --> 17:11.000
That's why I've stood up here before and it's been kind of weird minefield because we have

17:11.000 --> 17:14.320
a very intelligent group of kids who come to us.

17:14.320 --> 17:17.000
By the way, I love you guys.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.840
You're my kids.

17:19.840 --> 17:23.200
Except for the four gray-haired guys who know meatballs.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.080
Also my children.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.080
And I theirs.

17:27.080 --> 17:31.920
I learned from you guys we are a happy family.

17:31.920 --> 17:36.120
I would never change a single one of you except Keith in the back.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.080
I'm just kidding.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.400
There's no Keith.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.840
Are there any Keith's tonight?

17:43.840 --> 17:45.680
Wow.

17:45.680 --> 17:50.720
I went to Duncan Tressel's live podcast at the Improv.

17:50.720 --> 17:57.920
I talked a little bit about God there and I got applauded for it.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.360
You guys give me a hard time.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.440
You're very atheistic.

18:03.440 --> 18:07.960
Very intelligent, very skeptical people.

18:07.960 --> 18:08.960
It's very strange.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.760
I can't imagine there's going to be a huge overlap between Duncan's audience and this

18:11.760 --> 18:12.760
audience.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.120
What did you say about God there?

18:14.120 --> 18:18.280
Maybe they would have applauded the same monologue here.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.280
You came down...

18:19.280 --> 18:20.280
No, because I...

18:20.280 --> 18:26.960
You tried to start your own religion a while ago and you were roundly booed for that.

18:26.960 --> 18:35.360
I would guess on Duncan Tressel's show you came in a little lower than Jim Jones.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.360
I can't...

18:36.360 --> 18:40.880
Well, speaking smoothly, I can't interject and jackhammer you out of this.

18:40.880 --> 18:41.880
Dan, you're off the hook.

18:41.880 --> 18:42.880
You made it.

18:42.880 --> 18:43.880
Dan Huffington stuttered.

18:43.880 --> 18:53.040
That's the music that would have played if you had stuttered.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.040
Like mocking asylum music.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.040
What was that?

18:56.040 --> 18:57.040
What was that?

18:57.040 --> 19:12.120
I don't like that guy.

19:12.120 --> 19:18.040
That seems like a boring old school radio.

19:18.040 --> 19:22.320
Because it was so measured, it sounded really intimidating that you were holding something

19:22.320 --> 19:27.360
back that might have... you were not saying what you really meant.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.360
Yeah.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.360
Yeah.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.360
It was scary.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.360
I don't like...

19:31.360 --> 19:32.360
I prefer the other version.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.480
Yeah, you want to know what's for sale here, what's going on behind my ears.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.920
No one came here because I went to broadcasting school.

19:38.920 --> 19:47.120
I did not slave for hours, years, decades, millennia in the stand-up minds.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.600
You noticed that you haven't stuttered since we stopped?

19:49.600 --> 19:53.120
It's like, I'll do it on purpose, but whatever.

19:53.120 --> 20:00.680
But I'm just saying, when I want to find the words, whatever, how did we get on this?

20:00.680 --> 20:01.680
What is this?

20:01.680 --> 20:03.640
It wasn't us making fun of you stammering.

20:03.640 --> 20:06.080
I stammer instead or it mumbled and all kinds of shit.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.080
It was an experiment.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.080
All right.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.080
That's not all right.

20:10.080 --> 20:15.080
God and atheism and memos.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.080
Right.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.080
Well, yeah.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.080
I mean, you guys.

20:18.080 --> 20:26.120
Well, you're accusing this crowd of hating you, loving God, or hating you, hating God?

20:26.120 --> 20:34.640
Our crowd has a little bit, Duncan talks a lot about religious pursuits on his podcast.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.280
He has religious experiences.

20:36.280 --> 20:44.280
He's really into ramdas and eating things that make you see that sheep are watching.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.880
He reads books.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.240
Yeah, mushroom Jesus thing.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.240
Yeah.

20:49.240 --> 20:52.040
And so his crowd includes more.

20:52.040 --> 21:05.120
I think the fringe of his audience, I picture, is being genuinely almost tie-dyed in silhouette.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.120
Tie-dyed in silhouette?

21:06.120 --> 21:09.600
I was trying to think of tie-dyed in- That's the most poetic thing you've ever said.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.600
I should have just said tie-dyed.

21:12.600 --> 21:21.640
And then the fringe of our audience, I think, has actual surgically augmented pointed ears.

21:21.640 --> 21:25.640
These are fringes, and I love all of those people.

21:25.640 --> 21:29.920
I don't know who of those two I love more, but those two, and sometimes you might see

21:29.920 --> 21:35.640
a really nice, fun road movie about those two having to cross the country together.

21:35.640 --> 21:39.720
They often travel in the same circles because neither of them would judge each other.

21:39.720 --> 21:44.480
But one guy is like, hmm, I beg to differ about the thing that you said the other day.

21:44.480 --> 21:49.080
I did some research myself, and then the other guy is like, yeah, that's what I keep saying.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.080
Let's get naked.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.840
No, Keith, we're not.

21:53.840 --> 21:58.760
Stop pushing your nude agenda.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.000
You look great in tie-dyed.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.080
Leave it at that.

22:03.080 --> 22:07.440
And I was just like, in that show, I don't know, we were talking about writing in the

22:07.440 --> 22:08.440
creative process.

22:08.440 --> 22:16.080
I got a little spiritual about it, and I felt less punished than I do here sometimes.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.080
It's because you're smart.

22:17.080 --> 22:20.640
Why is Duncan Trussell's audience?

22:20.640 --> 22:23.720
No, they're not the opposite of smart.

22:23.720 --> 22:27.120
I was trying to make them feel better, not make other people feel worse.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.000
I shouldn't have gone down this road.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.800
Boy, that guy that defended Latin, what an asshole.

22:34.800 --> 22:39.960
His angle was he's tired of having Latin kicked around the block?

22:39.960 --> 22:47.120
Yeah, I mean, I would happily do like, if somebody could pull up the Twitter conversation,

22:47.120 --> 22:50.880
we could do like a love letters thing.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.200
But I lack the facility.

22:53.200 --> 22:59.600
I think I'm just looking at my Evernote thing, which I think is, it's all tapped, except

22:59.600 --> 23:03.600
for Aaron went to this camp the last three days.

23:03.600 --> 23:11.680
Aaron was at a special camp for hipsters, I think, it's called Server Lake.

23:11.680 --> 23:18.200
That sounds dismissive, I think it's better to say it was a camp for hipsters instead

23:18.200 --> 23:23.920
of saying what it is so that you're silently in your head going, so a hipster camp?

23:23.920 --> 23:33.200
I think they were very activated young independent business entrepreneurs who were teaching

23:33.200 --> 23:40.080
each other and learning from each other how to live in a new world business-wise on the

23:40.080 --> 23:44.320
internet and whittle and make s'mores.

23:44.320 --> 23:50.240
They did camp stuff, but they were doing camp stuff and having seminars and stuff.

23:50.240 --> 23:56.920
But weirdly, counter-intuitively, whereas if you go to XOXO, it's like, holy shit, here's

23:56.920 --> 24:01.160
your hashtag, here's your thing, I mean, because obviously we're fucking, this conference is

24:01.160 --> 24:07.920
about technology, we encourage you to gram it and tumble it and flip it, flip it, it's

24:07.920 --> 24:23.440
face nipple, it's new, it's face nipple, N-I-P-P-L, but in brackets, with a two after it for

24:23.440 --> 24:26.800
no reason.

24:26.800 --> 24:30.600
But this place, they took their phones.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.600
Where was this place?

24:31.600 --> 24:32.600
And they never gave them back.

24:32.600 --> 24:36.040
They had to whittle new phones before they were allowed to leave.

24:36.040 --> 24:39.880
Until you tell me, or Erin tells me otherwise, I'm imagining they're all on TPs up in Big

24:39.880 --> 24:40.880
Bear.

24:40.880 --> 24:41.880
It was Big Bear.

24:41.880 --> 24:42.880
Really?

24:42.880 --> 24:43.880
Yeah.

24:43.880 --> 24:47.040
I know, because Erin left her luggage there.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.120
And I said, where was this place?

24:48.120 --> 24:49.120
I didn't even know where she was.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.120
It occurred to me like, what if she had gotten hurt?

24:51.120 --> 24:54.680
Wait, you could bring luggage but not a phone, and it's in Big Bear.

24:54.680 --> 24:58.680
Yeah, you could bring your phone, but it's gone for three days.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.680
She's staying at Tent?

25:00.680 --> 25:01.680
What happened?

25:01.680 --> 25:04.120
That's a question she'll have to answer.

25:04.120 --> 25:08.560
But also, she had, I knew she'd come back with one good story.

25:08.560 --> 25:14.440
My definition of a good story is always a lot of Schadenfreude and pain, and like, just

25:14.440 --> 25:16.680
unfairness happening in front of everybody.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.680
What's the name of this convention or this camp?

25:18.680 --> 25:24.880
And I want to know how it all began, and is this the first or 17th year, or like, I want

25:24.880 --> 25:25.880
to know all about it.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.400
Well, she'll give you all the details.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.400
Why don't we just bring her up?

25:29.400 --> 25:34.400
Erin, are you...

25:34.400 --> 25:49.400
I wish that I'd gone out for ten minutes.

25:49.400 --> 26:02.120
World's Best Podcast!

26:02.120 --> 26:11.360
She was staring off into space like an autistic six-year-old while doing a Bobby Brown-derived

26:11.360 --> 26:12.360
Hoochie...

26:12.360 --> 26:13.360
Soul train.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.360
Hoochie...

26:14.360 --> 26:15.360
Hoochie Giration.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.360
Yeah.

26:16.360 --> 26:24.480
But it was combined with a strange final episode of St. Elsewhere, just chasing off to the

26:24.480 --> 26:28.000
point where I thought it was going to be one of those stories where, and then we realized

26:28.000 --> 26:30.880
she was an insulin shock, and we didn't know she would...

26:30.880 --> 26:34.000
That's when we took her to the emergency room, and they said, she's been diabetic for six

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
years.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Oh, boy.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.800
But last night, at the last night of camp, there was a dance, and it was future-themed,

26:40.800 --> 26:41.800
so I dressed as...

26:41.800 --> 26:42.800
All right, guys.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.800
I dressed...

26:43.800 --> 26:44.800
I dressed as...

26:44.800 --> 26:50.440
I dressed as Barf from Spaceballs, and I bought...

26:50.440 --> 26:51.840
I bought this giant...

26:51.840 --> 26:54.680
A lot of Spaceballs fans out there.

26:54.680 --> 26:59.800
I bought this giant cover-all thing in, like, 7X, because I wanted...

26:59.800 --> 27:03.840
I was going to stuff it, but I didn't, and I realized halfway through the dance that

27:03.840 --> 27:09.120
you couldn't see my body moving, like, I was working so hard to dance, but it just looked

27:09.120 --> 27:10.120
like I was...

27:10.120 --> 27:13.320
It was all covered up.

27:13.320 --> 27:14.320
Like a bobble head?

27:14.320 --> 27:15.320
Yeah.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.280
And I was drunk, and I, like, took a rope, and I was, like, trying to tie it around my

27:18.280 --> 27:21.040
waist, and I was trying to explain to people, like, I've been dancing.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.040
I've been cheating you of moves.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.760
It's got to get a leash around them so you can...

27:25.760 --> 27:27.400
If I can take them around.

27:27.400 --> 27:31.080
I've been jigging the whole time.

27:31.080 --> 27:37.160
So the camp, it's put on by this really great organization in LA called Unique LA.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.560
So you know what I'm familiar with, Unique LA?

27:40.560 --> 27:44.560
Yeah!

27:44.560 --> 27:46.560
They have a building...

27:46.560 --> 27:49.160
And the crowd went, whoa.

27:49.160 --> 27:53.920
They have a building called the Unique Space in downtown LA, and it's just about, like,

27:53.920 --> 27:58.520
I don't know, a cultivating community between, like, artists and entrepreneurs, and they

27:58.520 --> 28:01.240
do a lot of, like, made in LA type things.

28:01.240 --> 28:08.560
And so the camp is called the Unique Camp, and it's a camp...

28:08.560 --> 28:16.680
Our acronym is Cultivate Ambition Map Possibilities.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.680
I mean, come on, haters.

28:17.680 --> 28:18.680
Chill out.

28:18.680 --> 28:19.680
Chill out.

28:19.680 --> 28:20.680
Chill out.

28:20.680 --> 28:21.680
They hate God, too.

28:21.680 --> 28:22.680
Well...

28:22.680 --> 28:23.680
Cultivate...

28:23.680 --> 28:26.640
Cultivate Ambition Map Possibilities, just because they wanted to...

28:26.640 --> 28:28.640
Basically, it's, like, it's just people that love...

28:28.640 --> 28:29.640
They wanted to spell the word for you.

28:29.640 --> 28:30.640
It's people that love...

28:30.640 --> 28:31.640
Chocolate, almonds, marzipan...

28:31.640 --> 28:32.640
Create them.

28:32.640 --> 28:38.800
...Porsche, ambitious, multi-ethnic progress.

28:38.800 --> 28:46.280
It's basically just this very fun, camp-themed thing where different, like, creative people

28:46.280 --> 28:47.280
that are...

28:47.280 --> 28:50.160
It's mostly, like, self-made people that are artists and business...

28:50.160 --> 28:52.280
I really had no business being there, like, over...

28:52.280 --> 28:55.280
I kept on changing my introduction, because I get every...

28:55.280 --> 29:00.760
In every group, you have to say, like, I'm so-and-so, and I founded Eco Shoes, and I'm, like, I

29:00.760 --> 29:05.640
am Aaron, and I invented calcium.

29:05.640 --> 29:10.240
I was the fireman with the GoPro on his head when that kitten got oxygen.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.680
I assume that was more viral than maybe it was.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.480
No, it's pretty viral.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.480
Yeah.

29:15.480 --> 29:16.480
What was yours?

29:16.480 --> 29:17.480
What was yours, Aaron?

29:17.480 --> 29:19.480
Jeff went, then I went.

29:19.480 --> 29:23.880
Now it's your turn to make fun of you.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.480
But it's very neat, if you're...

29:26.480 --> 29:27.480
Look at that.

29:27.480 --> 29:31.520
You said you changed your introduction.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.360
What was the evolution of your introductions?

29:34.360 --> 29:35.360
Humiliating.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.360
It says humiliating.

29:36.360 --> 29:41.240
Well, I think my first introduction, I said, I do...

29:41.240 --> 29:43.240
Hi, I'm Erin McGathy.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.240
I do...

29:44.240 --> 29:48.120
I mean, because of the truth, I went because I have all these different interests, and

29:48.120 --> 29:51.400
I have my fingers in so many different pies, and I guess technically I'm a freelancer,

29:51.400 --> 29:55.280
but I have my podcasts and performing, but I make things, and so I'm just trying to, like,

29:55.280 --> 29:57.400
figure that all out.

29:57.400 --> 30:03.240
So that's why I went just for fun, and I also live summer camp.

30:03.240 --> 30:04.640
I just got back a couple hours ago.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.480
I'm very sunburnt, and I feel a little woozy from the elevators.

30:08.480 --> 30:11.160
What was the list of things that you introduced yourself to?

30:11.160 --> 30:12.160
Okay, okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.

30:12.160 --> 30:15.840
Driving up there in the car, your introduction that you had planned for it, was what?

30:15.840 --> 30:17.160
Well, I had no...

30:17.160 --> 30:20.520
I did not plan an introduction.

30:20.520 --> 30:25.320
I was very intimidated by the groups because, like I'm saying, there was an astronomer who

30:25.320 --> 30:30.280
studies black holes at Dartmouth, and there is, like, you know, all these people that

30:30.280 --> 30:33.960
have created all these things that a lot of you guys, I'm sure, use.

30:33.960 --> 30:34.960
But at my...

30:34.960 --> 30:35.960
So I was like, hi, I'm Erin.

30:35.960 --> 30:44.200
I do comedy, and like stuff, and sometimes I bake a cake, and I'm like, okay.

30:44.200 --> 30:49.640
And then I, like, you know, once I wrote something, so I was like, I'm a writer, but, like, not

30:49.640 --> 30:50.640
really...

30:50.640 --> 30:54.440
Not actively, but like, okay.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.760
That's going to be so annoying to hear on the podcast, I'm sorry, listeners.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.720
I hate it when I do that bobcat voice.

30:59.720 --> 31:03.360
Yeah, so I refined it to...

31:03.360 --> 31:07.360
I host a podcast called This Feels Terrible, and I do with these other things, and I want

31:07.360 --> 31:11.960
to kind of bring them all together and figure out how to, like, cultivate the community

31:11.960 --> 31:12.960
of that.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.960
So...

31:13.960 --> 31:14.960
All right.

31:14.960 --> 31:15.960
So...

31:15.960 --> 31:16.960
Took Erin after dinner.

31:16.960 --> 31:17.960
They didn't take her out.

31:17.960 --> 31:18.960
She took me out.

31:18.960 --> 31:19.960
They took each other out.

31:19.960 --> 31:20.960
You took me out.

31:20.960 --> 31:21.960
I paid for ballet.

31:21.960 --> 31:22.960
All right.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.960
Yeah.

31:23.960 --> 31:24.960
Yeah.

31:24.960 --> 31:30.600
I mean, we were, we haven't been apart more than, well, this is probably the longest we've

31:30.600 --> 31:31.600
ever been apart, right?

31:31.600 --> 31:34.280
Yeah, and definitely the longest without talking.

31:34.280 --> 31:39.240
And I was so excited, because I knew something, there's got to be something, and you did not

31:39.240 --> 31:43.560
disappoint after a lot of boring stuff about this hunky astronomer guy that swept you

31:43.560 --> 31:44.560
off your feet.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.560
He never...

31:45.560 --> 31:50.600
His name is Kevin, and he's...

31:50.600 --> 31:51.600
He's amazing.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.200
He's going to be my next guest on This Feels Terrible.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.200
He's really incredible.

31:54.200 --> 31:57.040
He, like, knows all this stuff about black holes, and he's a huge fan of Rick and Morty,

31:57.040 --> 31:58.040
and...

31:58.040 --> 32:00.680
Which is supposed to make me feel good when he's fucking you.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.520
Hi, honey, I'm Hump.

32:03.520 --> 32:06.200
You better love my cartoon, mister!

32:06.200 --> 32:12.040
Finish up and get out of here, or stay.

32:12.040 --> 32:14.200
We'll play catchphrase later.

32:14.200 --> 32:18.480
Oh, and Jeff, I made a bunch of people play catchphrase, so alienated.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.400
A lot of people have the rules.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.400
Who ran it?

32:21.400 --> 32:22.400
Well, come on.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.400
Anyway, anyway.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.400
The horse story.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.400
The horse story.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.400
The horse story.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.400
The horse story.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.400
The horse story.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.400
Okay, so...

32:29.400 --> 32:32.160
I think this is like, to me, this is like a parable.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.160
What happened?

32:33.160 --> 32:34.160
I mean, you're building it up.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.960
I'm going to make myself comfortable.

32:37.960 --> 32:38.960
So yesterday...

32:38.960 --> 32:39.960
I...

32:39.960 --> 32:46.160
You know what, guys, I'm just going to be myself, and myself wants to be comfortable.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.400
So yesterday...

32:47.400 --> 32:50.880
Did you learn that at camp?

32:50.880 --> 32:57.640
Technically, she learned it from Kevin, under the stars.

32:57.640 --> 33:00.320
Gravity is like just another stool under your feet.

33:00.320 --> 33:01.600
That's Cassiopeia up there.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.120
You know, she sacrificed herself for her lover.

33:04.120 --> 33:11.120
Oh, I wish I knew someone...

33:11.120 --> 33:12.640
Speaking of holes.

33:12.640 --> 33:17.400
Kevin, the stars are under my blouse.

33:17.400 --> 33:23.280
I definitely have the glow of camp, Dan didn't recognize me when I came to the car.

33:23.280 --> 33:27.520
You were wearing this knit shawl, is that an accurate description?

33:27.520 --> 33:28.520
Yeah.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.200
Like a knit shawl and a baseball cap.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.320
Because I want a scavenger hunt, so I got a baseball cap.

33:33.320 --> 33:38.080
I looked right at her, and then just went right back to listening to Radiolab waiting

33:38.080 --> 33:43.240
for my fiance to come to the car, and then the car door opened, and I went, ah!

33:43.240 --> 33:50.200
This knit shawl scavenger from Sector 7, this person that was dressed unlike anything I'd

33:50.200 --> 33:57.360
ever seen Erin in, like coming into my car, I was like, oh my god, you're not the strange...

33:57.360 --> 33:58.360
I don't know.

33:58.360 --> 34:05.040
For some reason, I have no idea what happened, but in my head, you were an Asian woman.

34:05.040 --> 34:08.920
I just projected a race onto you.

34:08.920 --> 34:13.040
I don't know if to me that's an Asian shawl, or I don't know what was in my head, because

34:13.040 --> 34:14.040
obviously...

34:14.040 --> 34:19.240
All those knit shawl, ball cap, wearing Asians, I mean, let's not...

34:19.240 --> 34:25.360
So, like Dan was saying, at the camp, there are all these camp activities that you could

34:25.360 --> 34:30.360
do in addition to these workshops, and I signed up for horseback riding, and it was the last

34:30.360 --> 34:35.320
horseback riding session of the weekend, this was last night, and they said on the

34:35.320 --> 34:40.920
sheet, come right at five o'clock, because, you know, they didn't explain why.

34:40.920 --> 34:46.920
Take our word for it, you want to ride a horse, there's an appointment involved.

34:46.920 --> 34:51.080
And I was very excited, so I was like 10 minutes early, and was like, you know, looking at

34:51.080 --> 34:56.800
the horses and, you know, imagining which one I would ride, and there were like 10 other

34:56.800 --> 35:00.160
women who showed up exactly on time.

35:00.160 --> 35:06.880
We get this talk from the horse training person who says, yeah, I'm so glad you guys

35:06.880 --> 35:10.840
are here on time, because it's so important for us all to be here on time, and I'll hear

35:10.840 --> 35:16.120
this explanation together, because these horses are very particular, and we get on these logs

35:16.120 --> 35:17.120
with...

35:17.120 --> 35:19.360
What do you call horse ropes?

35:19.360 --> 35:20.360
Rains.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.360
Rains.

35:21.360 --> 35:22.360
Rains.

35:22.360 --> 35:23.360
Or leaders.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.360
Rains.

35:24.360 --> 35:25.360
Okay.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.360
So we...

35:26.360 --> 35:27.360
Horse ropes.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.360
They should just call them horse ropes, for God's sake.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.920
Well, I'm sure there's a lot of ropes used with horses.

35:32.920 --> 35:38.680
So we're sitting on these logs, we go through this entire training session with this woman,

35:38.680 --> 35:45.160
and we see somebody walking from the camp, because the horse stuff is kind of far away

35:45.160 --> 35:47.480
from the bunks and everything.

35:47.480 --> 35:52.560
We see someone walking, and the leader waves at her, and is like, are you...

35:52.560 --> 35:58.360
Horse, and she just kind of casually waves back, and she does a hurry, and the woman

35:58.360 --> 36:03.520
just walks at her same pace, like she's a very fit, athletic, young woman, just like

36:03.520 --> 36:06.520
walking slowly while she's going over this thing.

36:06.520 --> 36:10.400
So the instructor's like, okay, we'll move on, and clearly this person's just taking

36:10.400 --> 36:13.040
a walk and was waving.

36:13.040 --> 36:17.920
Eventually this woman arrives, and she's come after the entire explanation, and the

36:17.920 --> 36:24.600
leader, the horse instructor lady said, oh, she's about to say, sorry, you can't ride

36:24.600 --> 36:29.040
with us, because you've missed the explanation, and we have to go now.

36:29.040 --> 36:34.320
And she's like, hey, and the woman's like, oh, don't worry, I ride, I'm very comfortable

36:34.320 --> 36:36.040
to the horse instructor lady.

36:36.040 --> 36:43.160
And we're all like, oh, God, I'm just very, so proud, and so shitty, and very comfortable.

36:43.160 --> 36:48.280
And then the woman's like, oh, but you need to, like, I'll go over the stuff with you,

36:48.280 --> 36:49.280
because just legally you have to.

36:49.280 --> 36:57.240
But even if she was an expert, like, Steeple Chase Olympian, we already know two things

36:57.240 --> 36:58.240
about this stranger.

36:58.240 --> 37:03.800
One is that she may or may not know anything about horses, but we know she knows nothing

37:03.800 --> 37:06.400
about group dynamics.

37:06.400 --> 37:12.360
She has walked into a group of people who have, she's 15 minutes late, and she's just

37:12.360 --> 37:17.520
announcing to all of these strangers here, it's all right, I'm an expert.

37:17.520 --> 37:22.760
Also, I've been around enough horse lady instructors to know that the first 15 minutes

37:22.760 --> 37:23.760
is all bullshit.

37:23.760 --> 37:28.960
I'll get there when the horse ride starts.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.200
The horses tend to learn a thing or two from me, tell you the truth.

37:32.200 --> 37:37.600
And also, the instructions were a favor to all of us, which they are.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.600
As we will learn.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.600
Yeah.

37:39.600 --> 37:47.840
So we all were assigned horses, and as they're assigning horses, the horse instructor lady,

37:47.840 --> 37:55.000
the hill, says, it's very important when we go out that we stay in the line that we

37:55.000 --> 38:00.240
go out in, because horses are like people, and they dislike some horses, and they like

38:00.240 --> 38:03.960
other horses, and some of these horses are very particular, and it's very important that

38:03.960 --> 38:06.000
you stay in this specific line.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.200
So we know that we get on our horse, my horse's name is Bergen.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.560
So we're sitting, sorry, I was just thinking about Bergen.

38:13.560 --> 38:14.560
Bergen.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.560
Bergen.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.080
So we get on the horses, and I know that during this time, she's going over this explanation

38:18.080 --> 38:21.160
with this woman who's ridden horses and is very comfortable.

38:21.160 --> 38:27.200
We get on the horses, there's a pin where you go in a circle, just so you get used

38:27.200 --> 38:30.600
to controlling her horse and going in this line.

38:30.600 --> 38:35.640
So she, the horse instructor lady leads us out in this line, and we start going around

38:35.640 --> 38:36.640
in the circle.

38:36.640 --> 38:41.320
I'm second in this line, and this woman who is very comfortable in horses is kind of

38:41.320 --> 38:44.480
towards the back of this line of 10 horses.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.920
We're going this line, like from the very beginning, the horse instructor lady is saying

38:47.920 --> 38:55.640
to the, I'm going to call her Blondie, she's blonde, so she says to Blondie, no, no, you're

38:55.640 --> 39:01.000
out of line, because her horse was going in the middle of the ring.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.880
Everybody else is in this line, and this woman who's so familiar and comfortable with horses,

39:04.880 --> 39:09.760
her horse is kind of veering out, and the lady is like, no, no, no, you need to go back,

39:09.760 --> 39:13.760
you need to go back, and she's not, she's trying, and she says, you need to go back,

39:13.760 --> 39:18.840
and then Blondie says, look, I heard you.

39:18.840 --> 39:25.480
She's put off by all the, all right already, I don't know how to ride a horse, I get it.

39:25.480 --> 39:30.720
But the woman's like, no, it's just actually important, like the, the, the, is she leaving

39:30.720 --> 39:36.520
her horse, is she coloring outside the lines, like, she's, I don't know, yeah, she's like,

39:36.520 --> 39:39.280
you know what, this is beginner's shit, this horse is going to ride an elephant, while

39:39.280 --> 39:44.480
I ride the horse, I don't know, where's the, yeah, well, and while, because she's out

39:44.480 --> 39:49.840
of the line, the order gets all fucked up, because the horses are used to like traveling

39:49.840 --> 39:55.120
pretty close to each other, so we're on our second, go around this ring, we're about to

39:55.120 --> 40:01.200
go out on the trail, we're coming around the, the, the side of it, and she's, the Blondie

40:01.200 --> 40:05.640
is trying to get her horse back into this line of horses, and as she does that, she

40:05.640 --> 40:11.240
spooks the horse in front of her, and the horse freaks out, I've never seen anything

40:11.240 --> 40:19.800
like this, the, the horse gets really scared, and horses are big, big, as big as a horse.

40:19.800 --> 40:26.800
They can eat a smaller horse. When they get hungry, they just lick their hooves, so they,

40:26.800 --> 40:34.760
so, so, so the horse gets super spooked, and it throws this nice mother off of the horse,

40:34.760 --> 40:39.680
bucks, and like, she falls to the ground, the horse is going, nyeh!

40:39.680 --> 40:45.520
Now, try again, try again. It's okay to get it wrong the first time.

40:45.520 --> 40:52.080
We just find out you don't know an old, even, even in a speak and spell, and I, I, I really

40:52.080 --> 40:56.000
try to go, try to put yourself back in that moment and do the horse, I, I really thought

40:56.000 --> 40:59.280
I was going to have a Michael Winslow moment. I thought that was going to be really amazing.

40:59.280 --> 41:02.880
Just let, let it go, just try, try it one more time, it's like, like, like, the, the,

41:02.880 --> 41:17.840
the mother. I think that's a swamp horse, I think we're, I think there was a loon, certainly

41:17.840 --> 41:23.480
a loon. All right, so, so a woman, a woman is dead or maimed or something like that.

41:23.480 --> 41:28.320
She gets thrown off the horse, and the, like, everybody's silent, and the, the instructor's

41:28.320 --> 41:32.280
like, still, still, everyone be still, everyone be still, don't move, don't move, and she has

41:32.280 --> 41:36.920
to jump off her horse and calm down this horse and keep her from smashing in this mother's

41:36.920 --> 41:44.280
head. And, and so she, she calms down the horses, everybody's silent, she's still telling

41:44.280 --> 41:50.560
the women to be quiet, she takes the spooked horse back into the stable, and then, and

41:50.560 --> 41:54.840
then we all follow suit, this woman is still, still on the ground, so I don't, we don't know

41:54.840 --> 41:58.640
if she's like, if she's dead or if she's just being still because she's, she needs to be

41:58.640 --> 42:03.760
safe, obviously. We get all our horses tied up, and then she's, like, I call out like,

42:03.760 --> 42:09.800
are you okay? Not that I'm the hero, but I asked her if she was okay. She, she was okay,

42:09.800 --> 42:14.080
they called the medics over, and she was fine, she was bruised up, she was just still because

42:14.080 --> 42:18.000
she was, she was, she was told that she was supposed to be still, and we get all tied

42:18.000 --> 42:22.480
up with the horses, and everyone is, I mean, I know, I don't know how everyone is feeling,

42:22.480 --> 42:27.680
I was feeling so happy that this woman's head wasn't smashed in, and I hear Blondie

42:27.680 --> 42:36.240
on the other side of the stable say, sorry not going out?

42:36.240 --> 42:46.520
She can't get a break! I had the shittiest day today. They started horse class too early,

42:46.520 --> 42:53.160
then the bitch teaching it tells me I gotta learn it anyway, then some other bitch's horse

42:53.160 --> 42:58.600
throws her off. Like, what's, when's it gonna be Natalie time?

42:58.600 --> 43:01.600
Natalie time!

43:01.600 --> 43:04.600
What do you think her deal was? Do you think that she used to ever ride a horse, or that

43:04.600 --> 43:07.760
she was cocky, and she was just like, or she just was full of shit?

43:07.760 --> 43:08.760
I mean, I...

43:08.760 --> 43:11.200
Also, what business does she start? I want to know about that.

43:11.200 --> 43:17.160
It's an overused term, but I'm gonna go sociopath, I'm gonna say her general problem is that she

43:17.160 --> 43:23.920
has no fucking empathy. Or was she like, such a good horse, but I was like, there's a horse

43:23.920 --> 43:27.960
for anything, I grew up around horses, I've been riding horses since I was a little girl,

43:27.960 --> 43:34.960
and these trained horses, they don't want to ride an alignment, I'm gonna go outside

43:34.960 --> 43:39.720
the line and she fucked up and spooked the horses, like, did she fly too close to the

43:39.720 --> 43:41.520
sun, or was she just a complete lunatic?

43:41.520 --> 43:45.840
Well, I don't know the answers to all those questions, but I just want to say in response

43:45.840 --> 43:53.200
to that, if she was any of that, if it did come from a place of her being a horse expert,

43:53.200 --> 43:57.840
or anything like that, she's also a sociopath, just from her...

43:57.840 --> 44:05.120
No chimpanzee walks into a group of chimpanzees where they're outnumbered, and goes like,

44:05.120 --> 44:16.960
get chimp here, out of my way, not sorry I'm late, sorry you're early, any mistakes will

44:16.960 --> 44:19.960
be on me, no one would bother to write that insurance check.

44:19.960 --> 44:23.760
And no concern for the woman that had fallen, was she okay?

44:23.760 --> 44:27.760
She was okay, but no, that woman showed no concern for me.

44:27.760 --> 44:32.320
She didn't connect those dots, she didn't go, cause you know, it can't help but feel

44:32.320 --> 44:38.880
like it's a little bit on me, like the story would still, she'd still be a shitty person,

44:38.880 --> 44:44.400
even if at the end she was kind of like, I kind of feel like maybe I should have just

44:44.400 --> 44:45.400
come on time.

44:45.400 --> 44:49.840
Like it'd still be like, yeah, fuck you, but she didn't even do that, she's like, you

44:49.840 --> 44:55.600
know, if this class is going to take any longer and involve less full speed horse riding,

44:55.600 --> 44:57.680
I want my money back.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.200
So the ride was over, canceled?

45:00.200 --> 45:06.840
The riding was over, everybody left, except for me and a couple other women that wanted

45:06.840 --> 45:13.000
to hang out with the goats and the, and there's like a little goat, I think you buried the

45:13.000 --> 45:14.160
lead on this story.

45:14.160 --> 45:20.320
There are these goats in this llama that I had become kind of close to, so I was, what's

45:20.320 --> 45:26.840
this camp called, it is a unique camp, what if it was just a dream I had.

45:26.840 --> 45:31.120
So I have a quick beef that I didn't talk to you about.

45:31.120 --> 45:35.560
But really quick, the reaction afterwards, like it was obvious what had happened, but

45:35.560 --> 45:40.640
the way that everyone, everyone said to each other, like almost in a way to deal with the

45:40.640 --> 45:44.200
trauma, like, oh, well I heard horses just do that sometimes, like they just like, there's

45:44.200 --> 45:48.520
no predicting what happened, like maybe a bee like flew in the horse's nose or, but it was

45:48.520 --> 45:53.680
so clear what had happened, and I kept on like, like looking around at people's eyes,

45:53.680 --> 45:58.520
and like, is anyone else going to talk about this, but no, no one else, even the woman

45:58.520 --> 46:06.280
that was injured, like, didn't, like, I think she, she knew, I don't know, well the woman

46:06.280 --> 46:10.240
who, the woman who fell off, she was bruised up, and she was very sweet, but she was very

46:10.240 --> 46:15.440
excited that she was the one who got thrown off the horse, so, yeah, I mean, she's, you

46:15.440 --> 46:20.880
know, some people are happier when they're the injured one, and she was there, her business

46:20.880 --> 46:28.200
was thrownoffahorse.com, the blog, it's like, she's, well no, that's not, that's not fair,

46:28.200 --> 46:32.040
I want to, I want to, I want to retract, I want to retract that, she was, she was, she

46:32.040 --> 46:37.120
was very sweet, and then the woman that was the, you're calling her sociopath, she deals

46:37.120 --> 46:44.280
with luxury eyewear, and she looks, I didn't even say that as a thing, but all right, so

46:44.280 --> 46:49.440
sorry, what was your beef? Oh, well, I saw Tom Kaufman at the Rick and Morty's writer's

46:49.440 --> 47:00.440
room, because he's a writer there, yes, yes, yes, he looked on Instagram, there were people,

47:00.440 --> 47:06.880
somebody took a photo at Unique Camp, so that's my beef, somebody had their phone, because

47:06.880 --> 47:11.360
Unique Camp and that whole scene, they're very good with all their social media stuff,

47:11.360 --> 47:15.280
there were 10 or 20 photographers the entire time, but like all the pictures from camp

47:15.280 --> 47:21.120
are already up, and like they were, the people that were in charge of the camp were Instagramming.

47:21.120 --> 47:31.760
Yeah, I don't know, a society where you can't Instagram, but the government can, makes me

47:31.760 --> 47:37.720
nervous. Aaron, you said you changed your, your, your description of yourself, what did

47:37.720 --> 47:42.840
it evolve to later on? I already said. Oh, you did? Yeah. Okay, I thought there's more

47:42.840 --> 47:49.840
evolution to that. At the end I was like, mmm, scuba. I invented the space shuttle. Scuba

47:49.840 --> 47:55.640
surgery. Now, did you come away from a, other than a good horse story, did you come away

47:55.640 --> 48:00.040
with any, any insights or any knowledge, like any good things you can apply to your life?

48:00.040 --> 48:08.400
Yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah. Prove it. Prove it. I will, you'll see in the next

48:08.400 --> 48:12.240
five years. No, I mean, the thing I took away was just, just integrating all of my skills

48:12.240 --> 48:16.680
into like one finite thing. And I was talking to Dan about a project I'm very excited about.

48:16.680 --> 48:23.000
I'll tell you about it too. Oh, thank you for applauding a, it's, it's killing juice.

48:23.000 --> 48:31.480
She got, she got, I just said it's killing juice because people were applauding a project

48:31.480 --> 48:35.440
without knowing what it was. And Hitler was mentioned earlier. I thought you said it's

48:35.440 --> 48:42.440
canned juice. Okay, now that we're all at full disclosure, I thought she said, cunt juice.

48:42.440 --> 48:52.440
I love that the real thing is, can we combine all three of those things? Look, I know I

48:52.440 --> 48:56.440
have something going on, really great going on here. And I've got to show it. I've been

48:56.440 --> 49:05.440
cunt juice. No, it's not. It's a very, it's a very obvious, obvious thing. Yeah. Doesn't

49:05.440 --> 49:11.040
it suck that you that, that, that every, every joke is this kite that we fly now and it has

49:11.040 --> 49:15.760
to have this tail on it to keep it from crashing into. Oh God. Well, in full disclosure, because

49:15.760 --> 49:21.840
of what I just said, I did not hear the word kite. You heard kike because you hate the

49:21.840 --> 49:29.440
Jews. Did she just say that? Wasn't that the dot you were connecting? Yeah. Yeah. I'm

49:29.440 --> 49:34.160
sorry. I'm going to step behind. Anyways, but, but fuck that. Who cares? The only worst

49:34.160 --> 49:37.960
thing is fucking talking about it. Let's just, let's just neo-fascist movement fucking

49:37.960 --> 49:43.680
heat itself. And I will be silently watching in the corner with a big bag of popcorn because

49:43.680 --> 49:50.640
I can make jokes about kittens, man. Sorry. Let's hear one. No, the, the, when you told

49:50.640 --> 49:56.200
me that horse story, it made me flash back to when you told me once when you were a kid,

49:56.200 --> 50:00.240
you were like this machoist kid. And one of the things you did when you were like, how

50:00.240 --> 50:04.800
old were you? And you, and you did the exact same thing that this woman did of the story

50:04.800 --> 50:09.840
except you were a kid there. You went to like this horse riding thing and you, but you,

50:09.840 --> 50:14.000
you were just like this sweet little girl and told them like, I ride horses all the

50:14.000 --> 50:21.120
time. Total lie. Yeah. My family lived overseas and we were, we were exploring around England

50:21.120 --> 50:24.520
and I went to this thing and I told them that I had a bunch of horse riding experience.

50:24.520 --> 50:27.720
Because you wanted the fastest horse or you thought you were going to get a shitty horse

50:27.720 --> 50:32.200
if you told them you weren't. I feel like other people can relate to this. Maybe not

50:32.200 --> 50:36.440
just exclusively women, but like it feels like with horses, like, oh, I know. You know

50:36.440 --> 50:39.880
what I mean? Like it doesn't seem like if you haven't ridden a horse that feels like,

50:39.880 --> 50:46.880
well, we'll just get each other. And then you just got on the horse. Sounds like a

50:46.880 --> 50:54.880
fairly brother's movie. You got on the horse and just fucking yeah. Yeah. Everybody, everybody

50:54.880 --> 51:00.040
was in a line, but I had talked about how great I was at riding horses and this, this,

51:00.040 --> 51:04.000
this nice teacher like wanted to empower me, I guess. And everybody was strapped in a,

51:04.000 --> 51:08.800
with like rope to rope to rope. And I, I had never ridden a horse and I was like, this

51:08.800 --> 51:15.400
is my chance. And I did like, but I had seen in the movies and we took off down the, down

51:15.400 --> 51:19.520
the mountainside and the instructor had to go after me because I, I immediately was

51:19.520 --> 51:25.560
like, I clearly like had never, you know, when you see it in the movies, it just, I

51:25.560 --> 51:28.720
mean, National Velvet was my favorite movie as a kid. And I just figured, oh, I'll just

51:28.720 --> 51:34.080
bear down and I'll be fine.

51:34.080 --> 51:39.480
I love that all your childhood stories are stories about you just like leaping and then

51:39.480 --> 51:45.440
maybe glancing where you've left. You just kind of like, I'm going to, I'm going to

51:45.440 --> 51:52.640
do this. And then you're like, uh, Aaron was blondie you, she was the shadow you cast.

51:52.640 --> 52:00.560
No, I do like her confidence was pretty amazing. I think she was very, she was very petite

52:00.560 --> 52:05.080
and looked very young for her age. And I wonder if maybe like, because people usually see

52:05.080 --> 52:10.840
her as like a young one to send to her, like she, she, she needs to approach situations

52:10.840 --> 52:13.440
that way. She's probably gotten way more, especially

52:13.440 --> 52:17.920
as someone who lives in America and makes, uh, what did you call it? Fashion? I wear

52:17.920 --> 52:24.320
like, like, like, like, like somebody whose job does not, does not usually involve like,

52:24.320 --> 52:29.640
uh, like, like hand to hand combat. I don't know what, I mean, I bet she's gotten way

52:29.640 --> 52:34.680
more, way more positive results, but the ratio of positive results to negative results for

52:34.680 --> 52:39.480
false kind of forced assertiveness is like higher.

52:39.480 --> 52:44.080
It seemed like bad behavior from someone who's not necessarily a bad person because I interacted

52:44.080 --> 52:47.800
with her later and she was, she was just totally cool. It was just like, just, I don't know,

52:47.800 --> 52:48.800
just really shitty.

52:48.800 --> 52:53.480
But it is like a parable because it's like, it's like, it doesn't, I mean, you, the people

52:53.480 --> 52:59.040
that get fucked over, I mean, I guess it happens on the freeway every day. It's like, I don't

52:59.040 --> 53:02.760
know. It's just like, you see that like weird look on people's faces when they do shitty

53:02.760 --> 53:06.920
things in traffic and they're kind of like, you just, you project all this information

53:06.920 --> 53:07.920
on to them.

53:07.920 --> 53:19.360
Oh my God, Kevin was saying the same thing about galaxies, but, but, but like the biggest

53:19.360 --> 53:22.840
nightmare of all is that when the person's like not even mad, you kind of want people

53:22.840 --> 53:27.520
to be malicious more than you want. What so often seems to be the reality, which is that

53:27.520 --> 53:33.080
they just, they're just like, they just, they're not thinking about other people. They're just

53:33.080 --> 53:38.400
like these mannequins that are like driving a car and they just like, I have something

53:38.400 --> 53:43.760
to do and they'd be so shocked if you, then other people who are like having a bad day,

53:43.760 --> 53:47.680
like they, they intersect with this behavior and then they're fucking now they're that

53:47.680 --> 53:53.480
person's mad and they go like, like, what the fuck are you doing? I'm all, I'm like,

53:53.480 --> 53:58.360
what the fuck? Like, like you just pulled out and like I saw you, you're the look on

53:58.360 --> 54:02.640
your face. You're like a fucking turtle behind a wheel. Like you just, you're just looking

54:02.640 --> 54:07.920
for a fly and but you're in a world full of people with three tonne automobiles. There

54:07.920 --> 54:16.320
are pregnant people, babies, giraffes everywhere. I went too far, but, but, but, and then, but

54:16.320 --> 54:20.920
then those people, like if you've ever actually like gotten mad enough to honk and then make

54:20.920 --> 54:26.040
eye contact with them and flip them off, like kind of like kind of vent your outrage at

54:26.040 --> 54:31.240
their carelessness. They, more often than not, they're like, they have this look on their

54:31.240 --> 54:42.240
face that's like, like, say moi. They're just kind of like, like, oh, me, my, my day today.

54:42.240 --> 54:46.840
Someone gets mad at me. What did I do? Well, or they, or there was a mistake. It's always

54:46.840 --> 54:53.080
a mistake. They didn't mean to, no, I mean, except for maybe like a weird, you know, character.

54:53.080 --> 54:56.320
Nobody's like going out there. I'm going to, I'm going to go ram into people or almost

54:56.320 --> 55:01.840
cause car accidents, but, but they also like, they don't, they don't, they don't, they're

55:01.840 --> 55:07.160
not angry at people, whatever. What I'm saying is I think that's more terrifying because

55:07.160 --> 55:12.600
why weren't you, why, why, why weren't you thinking about other people? Why, why, why,

55:12.600 --> 55:18.640
why, what you're, you're, this is, I mean, I can understand not seeing like, uh, that

55:18.640 --> 55:22.760
the light turned green or something. I don't know. You get lost in thought and people behind

55:22.760 --> 55:26.800
you honk and that's irritating. We've all been there. We've all been behind that person.

55:26.800 --> 55:29.880
We've all been that person. I bought a student driver magnet.

55:29.880 --> 55:33.960
But I'm talking about not, not, not, not, not, not looking, not driving. I've officially

55:33.960 --> 55:37.960
become middle aged. I'm listening to my podcast. I will bitch about young people driving.

55:37.960 --> 55:42.600
Can I add a correction? I listened to the, to the last week's episode, which is, which

55:42.600 --> 55:47.560
is really fun. In the episode, you were talking about baby names and Dan, and you asked Dan

55:47.560 --> 55:56.560
what baby names I wanted. Dan named two names that he suggested that I hate. Connor and,

55:56.560 --> 56:01.000
uh, Cormac. Cormac. Those are two names that Dan literally was like, what about Cormac?

56:01.000 --> 56:04.840
What about Connor? I was like, I don't remember that. I'm very sorry.

56:04.840 --> 56:12.760
But you like Paloma. I do like Paloma. Yeah. Maxwell. Maxwell? Nope.

56:12.760 --> 56:17.840
Is your name Maxwell? No, it was from the podcast. Oh, from your former D&D character.

56:17.840 --> 56:24.600
Oh yeah. Yeah. I do, I do like, I do like the name. My D&D character, Maxwell Artfall.

56:24.600 --> 56:31.000
Or yeah, or was that my shadow run character? I don't remember.

56:31.000 --> 56:40.120
What was Night Moves? Night Blade. Night Moves.

56:40.120 --> 56:46.360
That's what Dan said to the ladies. Oh, uh, one more thing, and then we'll bring Spencer

56:46.360 --> 56:52.560
up. You, you were telling me a story from camp, and then you started crying when you

56:52.560 --> 56:57.920
were telling the story and telling the story. And I was telling a story at the Memorial Day

56:57.920 --> 57:03.400
Barbecue where I couldn't, I could not, and I don't think it was that drunk. I'm sure

57:03.400 --> 57:07.480
it was, I'm sure there's some chemical involved. I'm sure I had enough liquor in me that maybe

57:07.480 --> 57:13.240
if I was dead sober, this wouldn't happen. But I could not tell this story without crying.

57:13.240 --> 57:20.000
I was trying, I was talking to two guys, Chris McKenna and Tom Kaufman, I think. I was like

57:20.000 --> 57:25.520
very incentivized to not fucking be crying while I was telling this dumb story. And I

57:25.520 --> 57:29.960
couldn't get through the story. And then that was happening to you at dinner tonight. Or

57:29.960 --> 57:32.520
actually, well, it was happening because you were telling about how it happened to you

57:32.520 --> 57:39.520
at camp. What was the story that you, the swings in Montreal?

57:39.520 --> 57:45.040
In Montreal, there's this artist that put up these swings in the middle of like a central

57:45.040 --> 57:51.120
area and they had their lit at the bottom. And when you, when you swing on them, they

57:51.120 --> 57:55.000
play music. And when the artist installed this piece, he was just thinking it would be this

57:55.000 --> 57:58.440
beautiful thing from far away. You see lights swinging back and forth, kind of like the

57:58.440 --> 58:06.880
light post outside of LACMA. But the, I wonder if I'll cry again. I'll just, I'll just, we'll

58:06.880 --> 58:09.840
see. That's what I want to, I want to, so, so there, there are all these, there are all

58:09.840 --> 58:17.160
these swings and are like 50 different swings. What he didn't anticipate was that people

58:17.160 --> 58:24.000
with swing, people on the swings like started interacting with strangers and, and started

58:24.000 --> 58:28.960
working together to like make music on the swings because they all made different, they

58:28.960 --> 58:32.480
all make different songs. So they would say like, no, you go this way, you go that way.

58:32.480 --> 58:37.160
And there was a picture of like a man and his daughters and he's like holding the swings

58:37.160 --> 58:41.160
and they're all moving together. And this woman was explaining this as part of a presentation.

58:41.160 --> 58:45.160
And I was just a weeping and then I cried at dinner. And I guess I'm all out.

58:45.160 --> 58:53.000
But yeah. So it was just very like, I was just curious like, are those things like sponges?

58:53.000 --> 58:56.080
Can you squeeze them? Do you have like three times to tell that story? I was, I did, when

58:56.080 --> 59:00.560
we were on the road, that guy told me the story about his, his fiance. And I had found

59:00.560 --> 59:04.480
that when I was telling the story, I couldn't, I couldn't do it without crying backstage.

59:04.480 --> 59:09.000
That's our, that, that, that night in, on the road, I think I don't remember what city

59:09.000 --> 59:12.760
we were in, but I tried it. And again, I was, I think I cried on stage, right? Cause it

59:12.760 --> 59:20.240
was like, but, but, and then at the Memorial Day barbecue, I started recounting how we

59:20.240 --> 59:25.760
went to NASCAR and cause we were, we got invited there. It was the year I got fired. It was

59:25.760 --> 59:30.600
a right before we got fired. The head of Sony has like a NASCAR enthusiast or they sponsor

59:30.600 --> 59:36.600
a car. Sony sponsors a car maybe. And, and we, we went to this NASCAR thing and Tacoma

59:36.600 --> 59:41.840
subway thing. And, and, and this woman that came to meet us, who was like the head of

59:41.840 --> 59:52.200
Sony's assistant, um, she sounded like, uh, like, like, like G, G, G, G, uh, uh, what's

59:52.200 --> 59:57.120
that? Gloria Steinem, the, the, the, uh, Jeanette from, uh, the, the Ghostbusters secretary,

59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.800
Annie Potts character, like Janine, Janine, which is how I imagine Gloria Steinem.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:08.160
Um, she, she, she, she had that. She was, she was like that archetypically like Jersey

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:14.000
and like, and she was like three and a half feet tall. And she, and she had like, I remember

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.920
I was having horn rim glasses with chains and like, which very, very, uh, uh, a tired

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:25.160
in a very urban chic way, but greeted us, uh, at the, at the arena and was like, I was like,

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:31.800
you are going to love NASCAR. It's a delight. Um, the, the, the drive is so amazing. It's

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.520
a great experience. People just love it. And it was like, it was such a weird, it was not

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.440
a NASCAR personality, but, and we, we, Aaron and I kept like,

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.960
She was very like intellectual too. Like she was very smart and thoughtful.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.280
We kept falling back and going like, is she forced to do this? Cause she shouldn't be

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.280
forced to do this.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:53.280
Cause if you haven't been a NASCAR, it's all, it's all very white. It's all very Christian.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.360
Like God is a big part of all of it. Like there's constant praying and it doesn't seem

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.560
like a place where, where, where, where it's just like a nice Jewish woman would want to

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.560
hang out.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.560
That's your backstory. She's very nice. She shows us where the sandwiches are. She introduces

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:12.240
this to the driver of the car. Yeah. Everything is very heartland, uh, you know, wasp, wasp

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.760
in California here.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.760
Uh, yeah.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.000
So the Pomona Speedway probably, right? Yeah, yeah. The final Fontana, right?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Fontana. Yeah.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Um, so, so, so at a certain point we've got, I go, uh, I'm going to broach it. I'm going

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.400
to go. So whatever her name was, um, how does, and in that space, she goes, how does a New

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.640
Jersey Jewish girl end up being a blah, blah, blah?

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:38.280
Like she, she, she like summed up, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And so it took, took

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.760
the whole burden of it off of her. We're like, we're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.000
How, what, what is this action figure doing in this play set?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.960
Um, and, and, and, and she goes, well, you know, and she starts to read, she, she recounts

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.920
the story. It has a real answer. And the answer is that when she was a kid, her dad, cry,

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.080
cry, cry, cry.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:08.040
Her dad was really into cars and she would sit with him and, uh, fix cars with him. And

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:12.720
then he died. And then she, she explained that it was fucking amazing. Uh, and I can't,

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.920
I can't say it without crying because it's, I don't know, it's just stories like there

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.520
aren't sponges that you can, that, that you can wring out. Like you can say three times

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.160
when all the tears are gone. There's certain stories that you met. You might get better

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.920
at telling and eliminate the parts that are potent.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:30.040
Yeah. Like I could maybe steer around that with my jet ski, like set way points, grand

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:36.120
theft auto way points that, that I know will avoid combat with my emotions. But it's, it's,

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.920
it's weirder to me that there's like a point in there where it's an uncontrollable emotional

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.160
response to something that's, it's not random because there's an emotional component to

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.560
that story. A father died and all this stuff, but something is happening to me because Aaron

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.560
said, someone said, told me, you could, you're telling the story. You couldn't stop crying.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.480
And you can try. I thought we, I thought we agreed that story was funny. Like it was

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.920
just kind of a funny thing. Oh no, sorry. No, no, no, we both agreed it was touching,

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.240
but I'm saying that you, you were surprised because it wasn't like we were balling that

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.320
day. Yeah. At the time it was like kind of a, not, not, not laughing at her in any way,

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:15.320
but it laughing at a like, oh, this is such a, such a seemingly like really touching, like

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:20.520
obvious, like on the nose, like create like story. For me, like father and son, mother

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.080
daughter stories and movies, like those always get me like, like Frozen's a good movie. It's

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:29.560
not a great Disney movie. Like I'm a sucker for Disney films. Like I, it's not, it's not

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.400
great, but, but like still like this song is when there's moments in it where like sisters

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.240
or like family stuff, I'll just start crying. I'm a, I'm a pushover for that kind of shit.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.040
You got to let it go, Jeff. Let it go. Let it go.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:48.840
I'm scared to watch. Young male friendships get me sandlot and stand by me like little,

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.920
little boys that are friends. Like I just got a, I just want to watch those. Just want

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:58.520
to watch them. I'm going to get you, I'm going to get you a white van for Christmas.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:04.240
I want you to live here. Can you get me a big, a baseball mitt decal for the side with

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.720
free beneath it? I don't know. I want to attract the right kind of boys.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.560
The ones that like baseball. There's, there are certain scenes and certain movies that

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.280
are absolutely meaningless to other people. If I describe a certain scene, I will start

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.720
crying and I've done it a million times. I cannot, like there's certain things that

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.960
affect you and I'm, well, I'm a crier. We, I think we've discussed this.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.880
I mean, you could cry. You could fake crying cute. People couldn't tell a difference. So

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.120
I can't fake crying cute. I can't just like, I produce a tear without like actually like

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.800
going through something, but I can cry on camera.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800
Right.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:42.160
It's a, it's, it's embarrassing because one time I did a pilot, I did a pilot. Oh dear.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.760
I did a pilot and it was two doctors and I cried on scene and the director walked up

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:51.760
to me and said, okay, Jeff, that's a little bit much. All right. I didn't have to cry

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.760
in that scene. Did I? It didn't say any cries. I just started crying into seeing that.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:03.760
That little boy doesn't retrain his brain. He'll be dyslexic until sixth grade.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:11.000
No. It was like, what time is it again? It was like, it was, it was meeting the scene.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.800
I just thought I'd really get an Emmy in that pilot that never aired.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.560
When I was in the, when I was in the fifth grade, I was in a Christmas play and at a

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.680
certain point the chorus came out with these big plastic lollipops and we're supposed

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:26.920
to be dancing with the lollipops. And in rehearsal, the director had said like, like, pretend

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.920
like you really want to lick the lollipop. And I misunderstood. So in the play, when,

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:35.440
when everyone came out and everyone's dancing with the lollipops and going like for the

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:41.120
podcast listeners, just like gently like a way air licking the lollipop. I was licking

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.720
it and like pretending to eat the lollipop. And I was, I forgot to dance was just standing

01:05:45.720 --> 01:06:01.240
there. And to get notes after a one-time production, yeah, they're just worried you're going out

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.480
into the world. They're not even worried about next week's show.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:12.200
The show is closed. Here's the personality notes. The world is full of scissors. So we

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:17.880
need to talk to you about your behavior on stage tonight. Yeah, I can't, I can't, I

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:24.960
can't watch that. Michael Keaton's my life. I can do when the dad starts shaving them.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:31.400
Look it up. When the dad starts shaving them. Michael Keaton in my life plays a terminally

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:37.840
ill man who is, who's Nicole Kipman is pregnant and he's, so he's making, he's taping his

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:43.960
life or he's taping, he's taping, he's making tapes that his kid can watch. This doesn't

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:48.760
affect me at all. I can roll my eyes describing this. Michael Keaton's making tapes because

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:54.600
he's going to die so that his kid can watch Michael Keaton after he's dead. You know,

01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:02.040
I mean, don't flatter yourself, dad, but, but, but, but Michael Keaton's dad is like

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:07.560
that. I don't know. It's something, something pheromonal must come off the screen or something

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:12.520
is relationship with his dad. It's just, it's just a lack of a relationship. And then he's

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:16.080
not even telling his family he has cancer for a while. And then there's a point where

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:20.180
Michael Keaton's too sick to get out of bed and his dad is shaving him with a straight

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:30.320
razor. It's fucked up. It's, his dad shaves him. Oh, it was fucked up. I also once cried

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:35.080
at the end of Doc Hollywood. So you go, you figured out that was just drunk. That was

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:41.600
just fucking drunk. I went, I went, I went on a date with a girl. What year did pretty

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:48.200
woman come out? Anybody? 90. 90. I went on a date with this girl to pretty women and

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:58.280
I cried, cried, cried. She cried too. But like, I was like, I was crying harder.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:07.760
Because you feel like a little hooker. You want, you, you want to, I haven't seen the

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:14.520
movies. I had a no kissing role, but I found out that you have to break that rule sometimes.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:23.440
I haven't seen it. Oh, Billy Elliot. I saw that with a friend. Like, it wasn't the girl

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.960
I was dating. Like a friend of mine. And we went to the Los Feliz 3, a little tiny theater

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.840
and we saw it and I was sitting there and I'm watching it. And it's about a, you know,

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:37.360
it's about a little kid who wants to, wants to dance and his family's poor, like working

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:43.600
class English family. And the family's, the mother dies. Father sacrifices everything

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.080
to get this kid through dance school. And at the end he comes on stage and he just swan

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:52.320
like and it's like, when he jumps in the air, when he jumps in the spoilers, everybody,

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.760
if you haven't seen Billy Elliot, 30 years ago, he comes out, he's an adult. What they

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:01.440
don't do in that movie is make a big thing about him possibly being gay. They don't make

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:05.680
a big thing about, well, you're gay, son. They don't do that. Like, you want to dance

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.560
and I'm a coal miner and like, or whatever he's, whatever he's mining, I can't afford

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.760
your lifestyle. I can't, I can't send you to classes. I can't do that. So they do that.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.480
And that's, that's father's sonship. That's amazing. And then at the end, when he, when

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:21.760
now he's an adult and they cut to all of a sudden, he's this huge fit, sexy, older or

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:28.320
not older. He was probably 18, 19. And he's like the, the, the swan and swan like, and

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.640
he comes out and does his leap. And I may cry when I say this, I've told it too many

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:38.520
times. And, and, and they cut to the father and he sees his son leap in the air and he's

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:43.280
like overwhelmed by it. And that to me, I cried so fucking hard in that theater. We

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.240
got in the car, I lived at the time, like six blocks away from that theater. I had to

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.160
pull over because I was driving and I couldn't see.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.640
You're watching in your car?

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:57.760
No. I cried in the theater and I was, I was embarrassed. I mean, I was not, I wasn't embarrassed

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.240
about crying. I was not embarrassed, but I was, I was afraid of affecting other people's

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.560
movie going experience because I was being so, I was like sobbing. And so I was trying

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:12.720
to muffle my, I was really, I broke down. And then we made it to the car and I got my

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.120
shit together. Or no, we were the last people to leave the theater and we got in the car

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.560
and I drove home and had to pull over because I couldn't see the road because crying so

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.480
hard. And I had to stop three blocks away and I was still just completely overcome by

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.480
that.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.480
Geez. Yeah.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.880
Get a life, this guy.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880
You know what? Fuck that.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.720
Yeah. It's no, it's no doc Hollywood.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:40.440
I got all fucked up by the Lego movie. Did you see me? Did you know I was crying next

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.440
to you?

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.840
I did not know you were crying.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:43.840
And usually I'm always watching.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.080
That was a tough, that was a hard one because it was right on the fucking bubble of what's

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:53.400
allowed to make you cry versus what's like just forcing it and like hoping you cry, which

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.640
I don't want to give a fuck. It's like a Lego movie. It's literally about corporate

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:04.000
plastic. And I was like, I know you want me to cry. It's a fine written movie. You did

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
a good job.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.840
But it's not crying for me.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.040
Musical crescendos when a simple story beat happens and the music swells and fucking on

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040
game over, baby.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040
How about me?

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:20.120
I think it had a lot to do with Will Ferrell. I think he's a really like, like, like stranger

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:24.800
than fiction. Like he's, if he wants to, he can, I think that's why he's so funny. I think

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.520
he's a really facile.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.680
Did you, did you cry during Meet the Robinson? Anyone underrated movie? Anyone like Meet

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680
the Robinson?

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.680
I never saw.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.680
Wait, what was Meet the Robinson?

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.680
Yeah, that's good.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.680
Fox and the Hound.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680
No, those guys are good.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.680
Fox and the Hound is my ultimate.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.680
That's good.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.680
And there are two, there's still little boys, but they're animals.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.680
Wait, what's Meet the Robinson? What is that?

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.680
I don't know. What's Meet the Robinson? There's somebody meet, there's somebody meet the.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.680
Meet the Robinson is about the young orphan who's an inventor. And he finds a family.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.680
I haven't seen that.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:04.440
I was watching the original Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn, and it starts off and I, who is it?

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.680
Is it William Holden and Boca? Who's in it?

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.680
Nobody knows her.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:15.120
But it started off like this rich people parting and they pan outside the party and they go

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:20.480
up this tree and there's this, the chauffeur's daughter from this rich family, this rich New

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:26.920
York family, she's just in the tree watching these sexy rich people party and they go up

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.440
the tree and they just cut to Audrey Hepburn's face and I was watching it at home alone.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.800
And I just hit pause and broke down crying.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:40.760
Really? It's such a beautiful story about Audrey Hepburn is too beautiful in that movie.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:47.800
Like I think that you lose the impact of that story so lost on her beautiful little star

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:48.800
face.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.600
I don't know if it's at home or the plot or anything. I'm just saying that when they

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.280
cut up there and you see her looking at that and it was that moment like so well directed

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.400
of somebody like what being on the outside of something and you cut to her eyes and she's

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:03.840
so beautiful and she's like so like unique, it's one of those moments where I had to hit

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.680
pause and just like come, I just came apart.

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.520
But I do that a lot so that's not what I'm saying a whole lot.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:12.080
Are you saying you were just crying at her beauty?

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.040
No, no, no, no, not her physical beauty. There was just that moment.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.480
How are you not weeping right now?

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.440
There's moments like Catherine Hepburn, what's the fucking movie? Holiday or some shit?

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.440
Holiday?

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:28.160
No, not Roman Holiday. There's one, it's her and what's the one with Kerry Grant? Is it

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.160
Kerry Grant?

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:30.160
Fuck, now I can't think of who it is.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.160
It's called Bright Middles.

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:38.320
He's kind of like a socialist anarchist. He should marry the rich he wants to go away

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.560
and be like do his own thing and not become a capitalist.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:57.440
Catherine Hepburn, she's like the not sexy sister, although Catherine Hepburn is gorgeous

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.680
and she wants the guy and the guy leaves and the door opens and she sees him and she turns

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.200
to the camera and Catherine Hepburn has the ability to always look like she's about to

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.560
like cry or say something amazing and she just turns to camera. It's one of those moments

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:15.520
where like somebody like tweet me or put it on some sort of forum, tell me all the details

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.160
about that. There's a moment where cinema, like the director, the actors, the script

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.960
all comes together and somebody just turning the camera and the way it's lit and the way

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:29.080
it's shot, they can just hit you like a fucking lightning bolt and like that's my favorite

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.080
stuff in the world.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.920
That's what happened in Doc Hollywood. You gotta watch it.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.480
You know who I always call Doc Hollywood?

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.640
Glory gets me too.

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:49.400
Glory had a shelf life for getting me. I think Glory got me in high school and then I started

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.440
to go like fuck these poor people are all just dying for rich people. I don't know

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:58.560
what, I'm just angry watching it. But Monuments Men, I started crying because Hitler lost

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:05.960
all his paintings. I've been wanting to say that for 15 minutes. I thought that was that

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:13.000
funny. But I'm also distracted. Is this a friend of yours, this young lady? Did she

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.760
leave because the show was terrible or did she?

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.320
I'm so much more focused.

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.160
I feel bad about where she's sitting.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.480
I don't think it's because your feet were in her face.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:30.160
I'm sitting at a certain angle and I want to keep the volume at the same place so the

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:33.400
person I'm talking about doesn't know that it's happening. But there's a fellow right

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:39.280
now. Shit, he woke up. This guy over here. Are you okay? What's your name, man? What's

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.280
your name?

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.560
What's your name? What's your name?

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.560
Colin.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560
Colin, you're right, man.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.560
I'm sleeping.

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:52.440
Because I've been watching you struggle with this the whole show, man. You've been head

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.200
in hands. Are you high or are you a little tired? What's going on over here? A little

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.200
bit of both?

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.360
Well, I just got back from a long trip.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:05.880
Colin, I could be wrong, but have you ever fallen asleep at a UCB show? I feel like I've

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.240
seen you sleep before.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.200
Oh, I thought you were being defensive.

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:16.680
No, no, no. When I saw him, I was like, that guy fell asleep at my show at UCB.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:23.400
But Colin, you've been over there. You're good, right? Oh, see, that guy just brought

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.400
you a water. That's great.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.080
That guy is podcast producer, Dustin Marshall.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.920
Colin, I'm just glad you're going to make it, man. Where'd you fly in from or where'd

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920
you travel from?

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.920
I drove back from Zion.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:35.920
From Zion?

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.920
Oh, okay.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:37.920
Where's Zion?

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.920
It's in Utah.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.920
Oh, Utah.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.000
You can't know where Zion is. The robots will find it.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.200
So, it's a little matrix comedy, man.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.200
Classic.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:58.360
That's what we do here at Harmontown. We sneak into matrix comedy once in a while.

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:02.960
Are you good though, man? Okay, good. I thought you might have, you know, some serious shit

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.960
going down.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.960
He's just a little sleepy.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.960
He's just a little sleepy.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:06.960
What a nightmare to be in.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:07.960
Nobody, nobody, nobody.

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.960
He was stirred from your sleep.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.960
He wasn't just sleepy. He was ringing his face. He was like rubbing his head.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.320
He said, I mean, that's what I do when I'm going like, God, please don't fall asleep.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:22.000
I know this show is just three people talking about movies they liked, but it's so much

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.600
like being in a car, just going down the highway from Zion.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.040
I don't know what's real anymore.

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.360
What was going down in Zion, Colin?

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.000
Oh, I was doing, I was doing some canyoneering.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
You do some canyoneering?

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Okay, the shit got fucking more interesting, doesn't it?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.560
What does it take to canyoneer? I'm not familiar with the canyoneering lifestyle.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:49.280
Go sit at Spencer's table, Colin. Get on the microphone.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.280
No, no, come up to me.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:54.080
No, no, sit down over there so you can fall asleep possibly.

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:59.440
Colin, are you a canyoneer by trade?

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.440
Not by trade, no.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.440
What would he sell?

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:05.440
I don't know. I don't know what a canyoneer is.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:12.440
He might sell rope or arrowheads. I don't know what he does.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:19.440
Well, Colin, we need four canyones today. Just make a list.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:26.400
These arrowheads are going out the door like hotcakes. We need more canyoneering to happen

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.880
as the overhead is so tremendous.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:34.320
Tell me about, walk me through as an outsider.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.120
So you know mountaineering, like climbing a mountain.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.000
This is canyoneering, so you go down.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
So you just send into canyones.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Is it a joke? Why did you canyoneer? Because it isn't there?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
No, we canyoneer.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
You know you're saying.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Mountain climbing.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:00.000
No, you have to climb up. And then you just send down into a canyone.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
How do you know when you're finished?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.760
So if a canyoneering is the opposite, you just send down, then the hard work lay ahead where

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.840
you have to climb the fuck out.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.400
You don't have to climb out because you get to the bottom.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:14.840
But isn't your car up there?

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:19.840
You just live down there for the rest of your life?

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:26.840
Okay, sometimes you can go from your car, hike up, and then come back down to your car.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:30.600
Or you set up a shuttle, so when you get to the bottom.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.600
Canyoneering a shuttle, Colin.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.600
Someone will pick you up.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:36.080
Well, sometimes it's a long walk back to your car.

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.080
Right.

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.880
What is your favorite part of canyoneering?

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:43.840
Clearly not the walk back to your car.

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.640
Do you like going down more or going back up?

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:49.640
The repelling.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:50.640
Oh, so you have to repell.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.920
So you're going to share clips and shit.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.920
We had to wear wetsuits.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920
What?

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:57.920
Yeah.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.920
Because it's going to get wet.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.720
Yeah, we had to swim because we had to swim in these canyons.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.720
Jesus.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:07.280
You're like a Navy SEAL.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.760
Okay, that's it.

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:19.440
So when you're repelling, you're in the movies, like the people, are you driving metal into

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.440
rock?

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.640
Okay, so that's like rock climbing.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.640
Okay.

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.640
They're going down.

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.640
They're setting anchors in here.

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.880
Oh, so you can tie something up the top because you're climbing up.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.080
How do you anchor yourself in at the top?

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.360
Like, well, we repelled off some rocks.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:41.960
So you just tie off on a big rock and hope that Looney Tunes rules don't apply.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:47.920
Sometimes you can use a nice big tree, but yeah, I said an anchor that was just a pile

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:48.920
of rocks.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:54.000
So you go down to a canyon, ostensibly your shit is up top, right?

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:01.520
So yeah, you park your car at the, you know, the trailhead.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:08.280
You hike to the drop-in point following some very vague directions.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:12.960
Sometimes it's very difficult to find it, you get lost.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.680
And then you climb down into the canyon.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:19.240
And once you're down there, how do you get, your rope is just tied up there, it just stays

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.240
there?

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.240
It's a way to get it back off.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.080
Or do you do like an Indiana Jones thing with a whip where it just comes off?

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:30.560
So you throw one end of the rope down and then you block it off so it can't go any further.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:37.360
You rappel down and then you throw, you have to have a rope that's twice as long as a rappel.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.360
So you can throw the other end down and then when you all get down, you can pull that other

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.360
end.

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.360
Oh.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.360
I would do it wrong.

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:47.360
I would do it wrong because I didn't even get that.

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.400
So one of your friends has to not be a canyon area, he has to be up at the car getting your

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.400
rope back.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.400
No, no, no.

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.400
Oh, no, no.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.400
When you're done, you get back up there and you fucking pull it back up.

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.400
That's where the car is.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.400
The car is by the tree.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.400
Basically.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:02.000
So when you get down to the canyon, do you guys have a little party down there?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.240
Do you guys set up camp and fucking make marshmallows and shit or?

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.640
Well, it depends.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:13.200
Sometimes there's the canyons that are long enough to facilitate like a three-day trek

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.200
through it.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:19.800
What's a good canyon and what's a bad canyon?

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:20.800
Like when you're like, obviously.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:25.800
He's not going to talk shit about a canyon, he's a canyon here.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:29.600
He's making all the arrowhead money.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.960
Obviously some trips are better than others.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:38.800
What makes like, oh, yeah, that was deep or like that was like.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:45.920
Oh, cavernous men, straight up cavernous.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.920
That was not convex at all.

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:48.920
It definitely depends.

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.320
It depends on what you're there for.

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:51.320
See, I like.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.320
What are you there for?

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:56.720
There's challenges of like some down climbing and some of the problem solving that comes

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.920
with setting anchors and.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.920
What's bad canyoneering form?

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.320
Like, were there any like faux pas?

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:07.160
Like you do you do you ever like you be going down a down into a canyon you see someone

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.400
else going down the canyon that guy's doing it wrong.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.440
Well, yeah, there was a there was a story.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.440
This group.

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.880
Well, it wasn't really a group.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:15.960
It was two people.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:20.360
It was this gentleman and his priest.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:30.040
That's already the wrong way to say that seems pessimistic, but but yeah, I got a bad feeling

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.040
about this.

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.080
They father rejoined me.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:37.000
He wanted to be baptized in this canyon or whatever.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:44.720
So he's for a priest is like, okay, so I don't I don't know what they were thinking, but

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:54.000
they went into the canyon with flip flops, like tank tops, like shorts, and a backpack

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:02.160
full of camera supplies, no water, no food, no helmets, and no rope or or descending.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.160
No rope.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.160
They somehow.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:08.960
They were going to butt scoot down the hill.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.960
Yeah.

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:16.800
They somehow managed to get down this canyon, and they got stuck on the opposite side of

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:21.920
this pool of freezing water, and they couldn't get across.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.680
Who did who told you that story?

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:26.280
The group I went with actually was in that canyon.

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:32.040
They were doing the canyon with all of their gear and what where his sense was to people.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:38.520
And I was just I not to digress too much, but but somebody was telling me that you watch

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:43.360
the show, it's a reality show called like, I should have died or I survived or something

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.360
like that.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.360
Yeah, I've heard of it.

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.360
I have.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.360
I shouldn't be alive.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.360
I shouldn't be alive.

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.360
I heard of it.

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.360
I should have died was too negative.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.360
They workshopped it.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.360
I should have died.

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.360
I don't want to live.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.360
There was a start.

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:58.960
Somebody was telling me with the show and they're like, yeah, they're telling me about this

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.560
couple that was like, they should have, they should have died because they kind of went

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:03.560
off to the wilderness unprepared.

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.880
But the thing that was amazing to me is that at a certain point in their story, they come

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:15.080
across like when things are really dire already, they come across a corpse, an undiscovered

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:20.560
corpse of a guy that had more equipment than they set out with a fucking chest or copper

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.560
pot to their goonies.

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:31.200
Like they like, it was like a fucking emaciated, skeletal fucking dude by a river that was

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:35.520
like, yep, I found water, not enough.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:40.120
But the way they survived, this is so fucking sad.

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.120
I don't know.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120
Are you going to cry again?

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.120
No.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.120
No, because it's sad about just reality.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:47.200
It's a sad joke that God plays on all of us.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.120
The way they survived is that the guy, this corpse had a lighter in his equipment and

01:25:52.120 --> 01:26:00.280
the guy just started setting forest fires until finally they caused enough of a problem

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:09.280
in terms of climate, in terms of global economics that vehicles show up.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.520
The guy got lost.

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.520
They got lost.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.520
I found a corpse.

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.520
Yeah.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.640
The corpse had a lighter?

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.640
The corpse had a lighter and it worked.

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.640
And then he just started lighting forest fires.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.640
Yeah.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:19.640
Hey, Colin, would you do-

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.640
What part of that story do you-

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.640
He's just being incredulous.

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:22.640
Dan, how about this?

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.640
Let's bring Spencer up.

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.640
Colin, would you mind coming up on the stage and playing D&D with me?

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640
Yeah, yeah, would you?

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.640
You know.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.640
We have a real-

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:38.200
Let's bring Spencer out.

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:46.360
You'll be great at it, I assume, because it's like simulated wilderness.

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.360
What's happening, you guys?

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:49.360
Hey.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.360
Spencer.

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.880
Sorry, I just wanted to get you out here, man.

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880
We met asleep.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.880
He came in here.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880
Oh, I know.

01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:02.560
I just saw, just real, real quick, large musical movie swells make me cry too, Jim.

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.560
Oh, yeah.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:04.560
Musical swells, baby.

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.960
But yeah, yeah, just getting that out of the way.

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.480
I don't think you said this, but I know Colin.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.480
Oh.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.480
I'm friends with him.

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.480
For real?

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.480
Oh, yeah.

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:14.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.320
See, I was just going to say, I bet you really like Colin because you're fucking- you're

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.320
a coyote.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.560
I'm being glib, but you're into life hacking and wilderness, kind of.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.000
Not that you're a big camping guy, but-

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Yeah, we definitely trade coyote notes, sure.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.880
Spencer, there was a- sorry, Spencer, there was a coyote- several coyotes up at the camp.

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:34.880
Yeah.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:39.360
Oh, Spencer's been telling me- Spencer drives me to work in the morning.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:43.520
He's been telling me that since that podcast- I don't know if he connected the dots, but

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:49.160
since that podcast, you've told me that you've been seeing more and more coyotes gathering

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.680
around your apartment.

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.880
Like, you didn't put it that way, but I was like, I think they heard the podcast.

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:55.880
Yeah.

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.040
They want to throw down.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:02.120
I wouldn't put that way because it's not factually accurate.

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:08.520
Like, when I dropped Dan off at his house, I was driving home and just like, you know,

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.320
a couple- near his house, I saw a coyote there.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.320
All right, nearby.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.120
And then I see him all the time at Griffith Park because I drive by in the mornings.

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.280
Oh, yeah, it's not near your place at all.

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.200
Coyotes are tra- finding you, though.

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.200
They're finding out and stuff.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.960
Coyotes are marauding through my neighborhood in Los Feliz and my neighbor, Paul Rust,

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.760
his cat got eaten not so long ago.

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.760
Yeah, it's sad.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.760
I see those signs.

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:37.440
And he said, when he walks his dog, he goes out, it's 2 a.m., and he'll open the door

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.440
and the sound of the leash jingling is the dinner bell for coyotes.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.800
They know the sound of doors opening and the leashes.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:47.720
And so there's a big ass pack and you wake up in my neighborhood to the sound of an animal

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.840
being absolutely murdered and screaming.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.760
And then people coming out and throwing wine bottles and whatever's at hand and throwing

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.760
shit at coyotes.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.760
Wait, this is your apartment?

01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.760
Yeah.

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.240
You live in a fucking what?

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:01.240
Let's go down.

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:08.040
Coyotes come down by the dozen, I know that the dozen's, I'll say, 400, we are the 400.

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.800
Just 50 yards from us.

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.800
You'll see, yeah, no, no.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.840
You'll see like one coyote, three more, five more.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:17.840
What?

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.200
And they come down in packs and they go down.

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.200
Come down from where?

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.480
Come down from Griffith Park.

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.680
They cross those fields of bull bar.

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.120
You can see them sometimes crossing like a little caravan.

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.920
And they come because of the dinner bell?

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.320
They come down to eat cats and they come down to eat dogs.

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.760
And my cat goes outside.

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:40.280
A dog across the street, the house, maybe like about a month, a month and a half ago.

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:43.680
I heard, I mean, I can't do an impression, Aaron, do you have an impression of a dog

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.680
getting eaten?

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.680
A dog being eaten.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.680
What kind of dog?

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.680
A small dog, high-pitched terror.

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:48.680
Okay.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:49.680
Oh, those are the coyotes.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.680
All right.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.680
No.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:52.680
I just came.

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.680
I just came.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:30:06.680
Someone's jerking off with that right now.

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.680
I imagine that about 10 times worse and louder.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:16.600
And then people were, I said, imagine it, but like, no, it's fucking, it's a, it's bloody

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:17.600
murder out there.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.040
And the coyotes are getting real good at it.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.760
Do you think they could get into my backyard and don't be a doomsayer and be a supportive

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:24.240
if enabling friends?

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.240
Yes.

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.240
Yes.

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.880
I will say that absolutely they can get into your backyard.

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.880
But there's a lot of bushes around it.

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.080
Our backyard is surrounded by houses.

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:38.080
Our backyard, you know, like not from your front yard, they come in through the back.

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.880
There's, jump down that wall thing.

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.880
But they would jump all that distance?

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.880
Yeah.

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.880
Seven foot wall.

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:46.120
They probably can't get back up easily, but yeah.

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.120
Well, that would serve them right.

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.440
I'd like to see that coyote.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:50.240
It'd be worth him eating my cat.

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.240
Just to, just to have him trapped in my backyard.

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:56.240
Dan and I had a racking problem and we kept catching the neighbors.

01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:00.240
I got a friend you want to meet.

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:04.640
No, I don't think you're, you're backyard surrounded by other houses that are front

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:05.640
gates and stuff too.

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.920
So it's probably, it'd be difficult for them to get out.

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:12.600
I just see them cruising like patrolling from door to door and they go in and out.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:13.600
They do.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:14.600
Yeah.

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:15.600
They go check out like back gates and stuff.

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.600
Yeah.

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:21.200
They were, I mean, one came tooling down fucking, I thought he was just like a drunk coyote

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:25.240
because he was, he was just coming down avocado.

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.240
What's it?

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.240
Little Dom's?

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.280
We were eating outside of little Dom's and he's just down the middle of the road like

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.600
fucking an REM video just like, everybody hurts, everybody hurts.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.600
Okay.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.880
It's the end of the world.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:45.280
But we had Harvey and he was a puppy and it was like, like he was, he was like just,

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.280
it's crazy.

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:49.880
There's a family of skunks once in a while that will just decide to take up shop in

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:53.840
front of my front door and they're adorable because his mom and pop and a couple of kids

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:58.280
and they'll just cruise up and they'll just sit on my front door and there's a Mexican

01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.280
standoff that happens.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.280
Like they're not going anywhere.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.280
I'm not approaching them.

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:05.400
It's just, it'll be midnight and it's just, it's just adorable little, little pole cats

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.400
sitting there.

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:11.320
And they just look at you and then the dad or the mom, I don't know, skunks, yeah.

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:15.040
Is that racist?

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.040
You made it racist.

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.720
It's got to be offensive to somebody.

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:18.720
Aren't skunks pole cats?

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:19.720
Yeah.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:20.720
Yeah.

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:21.720
Same thing.

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.720
Also, a Mexican standoff?

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.720
No.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.720
In Las Vegas?

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:25.720
Okay.

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:34.120
It's a gentrified standoff.

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:40.760
It's a, it's part Armenian, part gay standoff, given way to a nice place with wine bars.

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:43.120
Do skunks make noises?

01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.120
No.

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:45.560
I've never heard them make noises.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.920
If you hear something, it's the sound of them spraying you.

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:50.440
I always stomp my foot like on the pavement.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.440
I don't fuck with skunks.

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.440
Because at one time-

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:53.440
Well, I don't fuck with them.

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.600
I just make, I just make a nuisance of myself and hope that they spray you with the skunks

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.600
present.

01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.600
No, I want to scare them.

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:03.640
I don't know what happened when I lived on Talmudge, the shitty apartments, Talmudge

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.640
and Franklin.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:09.360
A skunk, I don't know what happened, but the skunk must have exploded underneath my door

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:14.640
jam because for a month, I couldn't even be in my apartment because your eyes would just

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:15.640
water.

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:19.360
Like when it's in close quarters like that, it's like, it's like neurotoxin, it's insane.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.360
Yeah, that stuff's crazy.

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:21.360
Sorry, Colin.

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.360
Sorry about that.

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:23.360
All right, Spencer, we have-

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.360
He's exploring a new canyon tonight.

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.360
All right, we're real quick.

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.360
A kind of, a kind of valley of entertainment.

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:33.080
A dangerous, rocky ravine that knows no bottom.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.360
Hope you doubled your rope.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:42.160
Colin, Colin, before we have you play possibly Camille's character in this, anything that

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.160
makes you cry?

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.360
Is there a trigger for you that could get you teary?

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.360
Flatland.

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.360
Mountains.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.360
Hates them.

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:57.360
Like in film or music or you see a nice sunset or a certain kind of thought crosses your

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:58.360
mind.

01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:00.360
And nothing really actually crosses your mind.

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.360
Are you a crier?

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.360
You're not a crier?

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:06.360
But sometimes when it strikes me, it just, I can't, I can't think of a-

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.360
There's not a genre that makes you cry.

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.360
You're not much of a crier though.

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:15.360
I mean, it's not like you're rock solid, but you're not, you know, like super emotional.

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:19.360
Sometimes there's like a, there's a, there's a moving moment in a movie, but-

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.360
That'll get you.

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.360
That'll get me, but I can't really think of any.

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.360
How old are you, Colin?

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.360
I'm 25.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.360
25.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:32.360
I, I, DeMorge was so amazing playing Mulrainee Sedana.

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.360
I'm just going to pick up where he left off.

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.360
I'm going to do it his style for now on.

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:37.360
All right.

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:39.360
Spencer, are you good to go?

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.360
Yeah.

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.360
Sorry to make us wait so long.

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:43.360
Hey, it's cool.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.360
I'm not feeling great.

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.360
Let's play.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:51.360
That's the perfect music cue.

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.360
Yeah.

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:54.360
That's the sound of my stomach.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:59.360
Wait, can you, can you, can you DM your, your stomach problems right now for us before you

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360
get into that?

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.360
Gurgling in the soft darkness of the sack.

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:12.360
You feel that not all is where it should be, but soon it would get there.

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.360
I don't know what that means.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.360
That sounded right, right?

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.360
I don't know.

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.360
What up?

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.360
Should I keep stomaching?

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.360
D&D.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.360
Yeah.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:27.360
When we last met, our heroes had just joined forces with the secret order of the seekers

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.360
of paradise.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.360
Charles Hoffman, their gnomish leader, shared with the heroes a magical tablet, which Quark

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:39.360
activated, causing a dangerous and deadly rip to open, sucking our heroes through to

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.360
unknown lands.

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:45.360
After licking their wounds, Sharpie and the gang found themselves in a new land, the Isle

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:50.360
of Paradise, where they encountered Yomiji, the angel guardian of the Isle, who demanded

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:55.360
a joke, a joke which Quark gladly supplied.

01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:00.360
Yomiji relented accepting the gang's worthiness and showing them to the plants of paradise.

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:06.360
The gang found the fabled Tarragon of Virtue and used it to force Admiral Darkstar's spirit

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:09.360
out of Christopher, initiating an epic ghost battle.

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:14.360
And after several blows, the ghost pulled a desperate maneuver, possessing Yomiji and

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.360
taking control of his body.

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.360
Then Sharpie declared a retreat.

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:23.360
But would they truly be able to escape Darkstar's wrath?

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:28.360
Or would they end up charred bits on the end of Yomiji's flaming shovel?

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:31.360
Find out on an all-new Harmontown.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:42.360
Alright, so I think we all agreed we were running at the end and we cliff-hanged and

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.360
running.

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.360
Uh-huh.

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.360
Yeah, so you guys have all that Tarragon of Virtue, you've got several clumps, you're

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:52.360
on the floating Isle of Paradise, floating high above the land and it's an island.

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:55.360
So where are you running to?

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:58.360
I have a question for Sharpie.

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:02.360
What is this Tarragon of Virtue capable of?

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:03.360
Me?

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:04.360
You're asking me?

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.360
Yeah.

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:08.360
Well, you can use it to do what we did, which is get our friend uncursed.

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:12.360
But can't we go back and attack Yomiji with it?

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:16.360
We can try, but I tried to feed him some and it was just, he's really big and scary.

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:20.360
But we're running while we're talking.

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:28.360
I have my Armulet of Spring and we're in a fucking goddamn, like I've been waiting

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:33.360
for months game time for us to be in a place with growth.

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.360
I forgot I had it.

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.360
I could entangle his ass.

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:40.360
Alright, so should I go back and kind of lower him along?

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.360
Is he chasing us right now Spencer?

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:43.360
Oh yeah.

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:44.360
Okay, so fuck it.

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:50.360
I look around and see if there's any sort of like wooded areas or like bucolic kind of

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.360
things.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.360
What's bucolic mean?

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.360
Verdant.

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.360
Sure.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:38:01.360
Okay, the whole isle is very verdant, but it's not super vegetated.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.360
It's kind of sparse.

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:09.360
Like even if you tried to hide in the one copes of trees on the island, I'd see you.

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.360
Poor enemies.

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:12.360
Sharpie, is that enough growth for you?

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:20.360
My Armulet of Spring, which has the kind of entangle thing to it, how reliant on verdantry

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:21.360
is that?

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360
Well, the Armulet's not.

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.360
It has vines as part of it and it shoots off those vines.

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:27.360
Oh, you're shitting me.

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360
I could use that on a space shuttle?

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:30.360
Yeah.

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.360
Oh Jesus Christ, I always thought it was like entangle.

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.360
Yeah, well Mulraine has the entangle spell, so she could do that, but yours is part of

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360
your artifact.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.360
Jesus Christ, I was like Boba Fett the whole time.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.360
I could just...

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:45.360
Are you saying we should turn and fight?

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.360
I look around and see if there's any canyons nearby.

01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:52.360
No, it's like an isle floated in air.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:57.360
It's like a magical island, like a desert island with one palm tree kind of thing, but with

01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.360
more than that.

01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:00.360
So small, you're not giant.

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.360
So we have nowhere to run to?

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.360
No, it's an island.

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.360
It's in the air.

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360
Let's turn and fight.

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.360
Well, Rhode Island's an island.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.360
There's lots of places to run if you go there.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.360
You could go to New York, you could go to Pennsylvania.

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.360
Rhode Island's not an island, though, is it?

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.360
All right, well maybe that's why.

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:18.360
Why don't we try to light him on fire, burn him down?

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.360
Just light him on fire, the guy?

01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.360
Isn't he like a monster?

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:23.360
He's a blazing angel.

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.360
Oh, he's an angel.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.360
He's already on fire.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.360
He loves being on fire.

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.360
He's gonna flame a shuttle?

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360
He woke up on fire and he said, yay.

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:35.360
I think our only chance is using this tarragon of virtue to release that...

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.360
Yeah, he defended, he tried to use Mage Hand to get some in his mouth and he blocked it.

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:43.360
Why are we trying to feed it to him, though?

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:45.360
Well, that's another point.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.360
Well, every time we do that, we've done it twice now and the spirit comes out of him

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.360
and it goes to someone else, now it's in somebody that...

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.360
I'm not gonna say we're...

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:58.360
Well, if we kill him, it's just gonna come out of him, too.

01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:01.360
I mean, this is like net neutrality.

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.360
It makes you want to give up.

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:07.360
You know, people from Comcast are working for the FCC.

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:10.360
Everyone that used to work for the FCC is working for Comcast.

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.360
Who got us up?

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360
How did we get up to the Isle of Paradise again?

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:18.360
You activated a magical tablet that sucked you through and damaged you.

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.360
It created this portal to the island.

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.360
The portal still exists.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360
Let's go back to that portal.

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.360
Oh, shit, yeah.

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.360
If we're gonna run, let's run correctly.

01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:31.360
And then have him chase us through?

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:34.360
Uh, well, I mean...

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.360
Then he'd just be in a gnome village.

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:39.360
He could fight the smoke monster from the cigarette store.

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.360
Remember that guy?

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.360
So we don't care about the gnome?

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:42.360
Yeah, let's go to the portal.

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:45.360
I mean, we've never been good people.

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.360
Well, we did our job.

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.360
We got Christopher Heald.

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.360
Let's get the fuck out of here, right?

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.360
Yeah.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.360
Sounds good to me?

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.360
Head for the portal!

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.360
We run to the portal.

01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:00.360
You run towards the portal and it glows softly.

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:05.360
It's covered in dazzling, polygonal shapes that kind of slough off of it

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:08.360
like some sort of spray or water.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.360
It's magical.

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.360
It looks painful, though.

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:14.360
Like, you recall when you went through it, it hurt pretty bad.

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:17.360
Your skin was rent from your bodies in some places.

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:20.360
You remember that as you run towards the portal

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.360
and Yomiji chases you.

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.360
Should we try to get him to go first?

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.360
Yeah, at the last second, let's all just jump out of the way.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.360
Yeah.

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.360
Look, I don't mind stopping, spreading out

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:44.360
and kind of like, you know, attacking him from multiple directions.

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:46.360
Yeah, I said we put up a fight with this guy.

01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.360
Let's fucking do it.

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.360
But here's the thing.

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.360
This is just table talk.

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:52.360
I'm not taking a turn having this conversation,

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.360
but I guess I should because this is what our characters are saying.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.360
I can talk about this all day.

01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.360
But instead, I'm just going to talk about it.

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:05.360
If we kill him, it's the same effect as putting tarragon in his mouth,

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.360
which just seems to be an endless...

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.360
There's no fucking end in sight to this.

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.360
This Dark Star ghost comes out of him,

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:15.360
and it goes into someone else.

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.360
It's like Vietnam.

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.360
This is our Vietnam.

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.360
Yeah, but we haven't killed him.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.360
Maybe it just stopped when he died.

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:27.360
Because we killed... I mean, we... wait...

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.360
Didn't we kill somebody and then the ghost came out of him?

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:33.360
You stuffed tarragon into Charles Hoffman's mouth.

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.360
Okay, so we did that with Kumail.

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:36.360
We did that with Charles Hoffman.

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.360
Okay, so we have never actually killed an entity that had this thing.

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:43.360
Maybe, and I know I just said that I was committing to playing like Demorge,

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:48.360
but what if I, with my supplies, built...

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.360
Here we go.

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.360
Don't fall off a wagon just yet, sweetie.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.360
I'm not falling off the wagon.

01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.360
I was just making a joke.

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:58.360
It felt real.

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.360
But what if...

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.360
Because we... he jumps into like the nearest...

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:10.360
Is he jumping into the nearest vessel or like the most...

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:12.360
I don't think so. I think it's more random.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.360
It's random.

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.360
So he's able to travel to like something far away.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:22.360
Like if we made like a decoy vessel that we could burn,

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.360
like if I was to build like an ogre with a crown and be like,

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:29.360
that's the king of all ogres.

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.360
I'd have him there and feed him the tarragon and be like,

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:33.360
oh, I'm going to jump into this king.

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:36.360
And we'd be like, no, it's made out of yarn.

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:38.360
Like...

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:40.360
And then we would set it on fire.

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:43.360
Like, is he able... he's able to just travel.

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:44.360
He travels.

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.360
I mean...

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.360
I think maybe he's just around forever.

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.360
Well, I...

01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:52.360
I didn't make him.

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:54.360
And also I don't think he'd go into sticks and stuff.

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.360
He can't go into sticks.

01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.360
What if we took a pig's heart or something and put him in the...

01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.360
Let's just try to kill him.

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:03.360
I turn and fire an arrow.

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:05.360
There you go, Colin.

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:08.360
Sleepy canyon air.

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.360
You fire an arrow.

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:12.360
What's the damage on that?

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.360
Because you hit 1d6.

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.360
1d6 plus what?

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.360
4.

01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:21.360
Dealing 6 damage to Yomiji.

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:24.360
He takes an arrow in the thigh.

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.360
So we're fighting this guy now.

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.360
Well, he is.

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:33.360
I produce my armula to summer and I create my fire armor.

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.360
Breathing yourself in fiery air or armor.

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.360
You feel the fire's warmth.

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.360
Do you want to do another thing?

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.360
Yeah.

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.360
I guess I don't...

01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:45.360
Activating is pretty quick.

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:47.360
I know what I'm on fire, I'm not sure what to do.

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:50.360
Oh, speaking of fire, the whole island's on fire.

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.360
You lit it on fire...

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.360
You lit it on fire, Quark, in the last episode.

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:56.360
I did?

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:58.360
Yeah, I forgot.

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:03.360
Fire blazes all around you, choking smoke.

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.360
Why'd you light the island up?

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.360
I don't remember that at all.

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:09.360
You used a flaming...

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:11.360
Flaming sword?

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.360
Maybe we should take this fight through the portal.

01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:19.360
I fire five fire arrows, which I guess are just arrows.

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.360
You can only do three, is three cool?

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:24.360
It says I can fire five arrows at once.

01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:28.360
See, Demorge could do four with the Wisperer bow.

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:30.360
Demorge, Demorge was so great.

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:32.360
And I think that used up his only...

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.360
I'll take three, that's fine.

01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:35.360
Okay.

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:37.360
That's a really good job.

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:42.360
Two arrows and red the sheet.

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:44.360
Two of your arrows strike true.

01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.360
The other one, it just goes into the grass, the burning grass.

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:50.360
But two, two.

01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:54.360
Yeah, two arrows just plunk into each of his shoulders.

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:55.360
Aha!

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:57.360
A total 19 damage.

01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:59.360
Yeah!

01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:01.360
I'm gonna venture you to death.

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.360
I call it my Armourlet of Winter and call it a snowstorm to put the fire out.

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:08.360
Woosh, woosh!

01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:15.360
Smoke coalesces into clouds which sprinkle sleet onto the fire.

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:19.360
It starts calming it in some of the less fiery areas,

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:22.360
but the blaze is still largely burning.

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:25.360
It's just more contained now.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.360
I'm trying to help you guys.

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:29.360
It's helping.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.360
But that doesn't take very long.

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:31.360
That's like activating the thing.

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.360
Is that my whole turn?

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.360
No.

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:34.360
It's not?

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:41.360
I go into a rage and I do powerful blow.

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.360
Powerful blow!

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:48.360
And then he just starts talking about Unbreakable all night.

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:52.360
I mean, it's really good blow.

01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:57.360
Going into your rage and striking a powerful blow.

01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.360
You do so.

01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360
What weapon was that?

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.360
Mighty Greatsword.

01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.360
What's the damage?

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:04.360
That's 2 to 8 plus 7.

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:06.360
2 to 8 plus 7.

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.360
Dealing 23 damage.

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:10.360
That's you!

01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.360
You're easy.

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:13.360
Did some blow.

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.360
Powerful blow.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:20.360
If you're listening at home, kids, it's just going to do powerful blow.

01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:25.360
Helps you beat the angels.

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:26.360
That's good.

01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:31.360
You don't have to force schizophrenic kids.

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.360
Put me in your note.

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:34.360
It's all I ask.

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.360
He's not kidding.

01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:40.360
That's the terrifying thing is he's not kidding.

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:45.360
I don't want to be in it.

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:51.360
It would be a guaranteed biopic, but I don't want it.

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.360
Am I up?

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.360
Sure.

01:47:53.360 --> 01:48:00.360
I want to cast Mage Armor just because it's not because I'm selfish.

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:01.360
I'm just weak.

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:03.360
I need extra protection.

01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:04.360
Touching your clothes.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.360
They become stiff and armorous.

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:15.360
If I have time left, I'd like to try to ensnare this angelic biatch with my Armulative Spring.

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:21.360
Activating your Armulative Spring, you attempt to do so.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:24.360
He gets caught by the legs, by your vines.

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.360
He can't move so well.

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:31.360
He's not immobile, but he's definitely kind of stuck.

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.360
Not great.

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.360
We got him where we want him.

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:41.360
He starts swinging his flame and axe around.

01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:48.360
He's trying to generally start fires and attack people in his general vicinity.

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.360
He doesn't hit anybody, but he does manage to strike the entanglements.

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.360
He slashes those off.

01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:01.360
Then he shoots Eye Lasers, but he misses.

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:03.360
Not your day yet, Meiji.

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.360
No, it's not.

01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:07.360
That would be a constant.

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.360
I want to try to sneak up behind him.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:13.360
Putting on your best sneakingness.

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:16.360
You try and sneak up on him.

01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:19.360
Not very sneaky, but you are behind him.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:22.360
I am behind him, though.

01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:25.360
I stab him with my poison dagger.

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360
With the poison dagger.

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:30.360
Use that poison dagger through my heart.

01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.360
I hate it.

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:35.360
Stabbing with your poison dagger.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:42.360
Your knife sinks into his angel flesh, but it doesn't seem to do any damage.

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.360
It's weird.

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:45.360
Just doesn't.

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.360
Maybe it's because you weren't sneaky enough.

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.360
Sorry.

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:54.360
Was it Jeff's turn, or is it Mauryam's next?

01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:59.360
Not today, Meiji.

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:02.360
I'm going to use my...

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.360
Was that your turn?

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:12.360
She cast Magic Singer.

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:16.360
It's about to get really hot.

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.360
It doesn't make any sense.

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.360
I'm going to use my whisper bow.

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:25.360
And I'm going to whisper in Elvish.

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:29.360
Scribble.

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.360
Little baby.

01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.360
Go.

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.360
Tick-a-tock.

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:37.360
Cheetah.

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.360
Cheeto.

01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:45.360
Bicycle.

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:52.360
You whisper with your whisper bow, but it only works once per day, so your whispering is in vain.

01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:55.360
No, I wasn't.

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:58.360
I heard it.

01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:02.360
You could still fire three arrows, but not the whisper bow style.

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.360
Okay.

01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:09.360
Well, so I guess I do that.

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:12.360
I also blow up a balloon, because nothing matters.

01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:18.360
Firing three arrows, two of them, fly off the island, never to be seen again.

01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:19.360
Goodbye.

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:24.360
The third, hits Yo-Miji right in his pectoral and deals four damage.

01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:27.360
Ha-ha! Burned.

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.360
Spencer, what a surprise.

01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.360
Sorry, Moment of Clarity.

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:33.360
Moment of Clarity.

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:36.360
It always comes after doing way too much powerful blow.

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:40.360
Ha-ha!

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:45.360
I cast Morton Canaan's Rock Bottom.

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:48.360
I cast Staring Too Long in the Near.

01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:52.360
I summon Sponsor.

01:51:52.360 --> 01:52:00.360
I summon my Spirit Sponsor to help me get the powder out of the tile grout.

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:04.360
It lets you not be as crazed when you're on a rage.

01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:10.360
Okay, can I use that and do a power attack?

01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.360
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:16.360
Alright, so I take my Mighty Greatsword and I summon my Moment of Clarity,

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.360
and I do a...

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:21.360
Where am I in relationship to him right now?

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:24.360
You know, in front maybe.

01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:26.360
How tall is he?

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:28.360
He's 12 feet tall.

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:30.360
Alright, I go...

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:33.360
Is he kind of standing with his legs apart?

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:34.360
Yep.

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.360
Okay, I come running in and I change it.

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.360
I do a Moment of Clarity Far Sword attack.

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:42.360
I run between his legs and do a Far Sword and try to cleave him right in two.

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:45.360
Right up his wiener, like through his head.

01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:49.360
You only got one Far Sword per day also, I think.

01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.360
So, you should be out.

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.360
Say what?

01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:53.360
I think you only have one Far Sword.

01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:57.360
Okay, then I'll just jump into a Greatsword right through his crotch.

01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:01.360
Summoning a brief moment of clarity, you weigh your options

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:07.360
before launching yourself directly at his scrotal sack.

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:09.360
You've gone from pretty woman to monster.

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.360
Can I go back in time?

01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:11.360
Can I go back in time a little bit?

01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:12.360
Sure.

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:15.360
Can I put a little pteragon of virtue on the tip of my sword just in case

01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.360
and see if it does anything?

01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.360
Yep.

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.360
Alright, I go over whoever has a pteragon of virtue,

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:23.360
I put some on my sword and just in case it might be like a poison,

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:25.360
like some sort of magical thing.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:29.360
And then I do the same attack up the butt.

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:34.360
Being wildly with your power attack, your powerful swing is not as accurate

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:38.360
as a normal barbarian-style non-power attack swing

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:41.360
and just nicks him in the leg.

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:44.360
It doesn't hurt.

01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:46.360
What about the femoral artery?

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.360
Don't angels have those?

01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.360
Not angels.

01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:52.360
There's a bunch of shit.

01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:54.360
What about demons?

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:55.360
Powerful.

01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.360
Alright, it's 10 or 3.

01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.360
When's it my turn?

01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:01.360
Okay, I said check this out.

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:03.360

Make it count.

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:10.360
Why don't you pick on someone our size?

Shrinking down to 6 feet tall.

Ah.
