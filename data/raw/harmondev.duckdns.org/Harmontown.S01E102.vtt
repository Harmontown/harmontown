{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:04.000\nFeral Audio\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:15.000\nHello Hollywood!\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:18.000\nHollywood, California!\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:21.000\nMeltdown Comics!\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:28.000\nThere's no theater!\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:34.000\nSing it Freddie.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:37.000\nGuess what everybody?\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:40.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:48.000\nWelcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:55.000\nThank you.\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:02.000\nA weird thing happened there because I heard cheering and I was preoccupied and I was like,\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:11.000\nwe're relaxed now, we've done a lot of these shows so I was just coming in and I thought for a second because I heard cheering and then I heard silence.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:20.000\nAnd then I looked and I thought I ran up halfway because I thought you had introduced me and I was lagging.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:29.000\nAnd then I came up halfway and froze like a rabbit and then you finished introducing me during which I kind of slinked back like a cobra.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:32.000\nAnd then I sprang up.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:41.000\nIt was the podcast introduction equivalent of two guys in the men's room doorway when you're kind of like, you don't know.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:46.000\nNormally I try to keep the thing rolling and you know logically when it's time for you to come up.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:52.000\nI was moved by a queen musical interlude to pause for a moment.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:53.000\nAh, see, yeah.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:56.000\nOr as they say in music, I went tacit.\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:02.000\nJeff, you know how the people have the, what would Jesus do?\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:08.000\nIt's a question they ask themselves, keep some on point in a Christian sense.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:10.000\nWhat would Jesus do?\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:11.000\nIt's a yardstick.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:12.000\nIt's a guideline.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:26.000\nI have, I decided today this morning my, my, I have a new Twitter guideline, which is why is Tony Danza following me?\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:30.000\nAnd how do I make that keep happening?\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:32.000\nHow long has he been following you?\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:33.000\nI'm not sure.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nI don't know if there's a, was there a way to know that?\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:38.000\nCan you date stamp when somebody started following you?\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:45.000\nYeah, that sounds like an invasion of privacy that I, I don't think this society would put up with.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:50.000\nWell, but how do you use why is Tony Danza following me as a yardstick of morality?\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:55.000\nBecause, because, because it's, it's, it's, you know how when you're in an argument, you should, you should stop and take deep breaths.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:56.000\nOh.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:57.000\nBreath start.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:03.000\nIt's like letting your auto now, whatever shit you're in, just step back and imagine Tony Danza's watching.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:08.000\nFor me, maybe it's a different person for you guys.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:14.000\nLike it's, it's just like, it's not because I'm afraid of letting Tony Danza down, but it's, but I also don't have contempt for him.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:19.000\nSo it's like, he's kind of like the ultimate stranger, the ultimate boss.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:26.000\nI'm not sure if he's the boss, but yeah, he's, I don't know.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:37.000\nIt's just the idea that Tony Danza, like I, like, oh, like it would be a nightmare for me to have Tony Danza be reading me, getting into arguments about, about, you know, political correctness or something,\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nwhether 17 year old or something.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nMy worst, well, not my worst nightmare, but it's just like, it's a nightmare that keeps you in check.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:50.000\nIt's like Tony Danza is picking out a shirt and he's looking through his phone and he's, he's like, yeah, I don't need this.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:55.000\nI mean, I think guys, I didn't buy a ticket to this ride.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:59.000\nThere's a possibility that like you've done something right to make Tony Danza follow you.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:05.000\nAnd then maybe you could cross a line and do something that would make him not follow you so that you could use that as a moral compass.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:06.000\nYeah.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:11.000\nBut I mean, what would, what would Tony Danza unfollow me for doing?\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:12.000\nYeah.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:13.000\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nYeah.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:15.000\nYeah.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:16.000\nSo anyways, I don't know.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nJust give it a shot.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nSee if it changes your behavior this week, but there's no control group.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nWe don't know what you did that made him follow you.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:23.000\nIt might have been bad behavior.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:24.000\nWe don't know.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:25.000\nAnd he might have been like, I like that guy.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:26.000\nHe's bad.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nIt's like me.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nThere's a young Tony Danza.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\nHe's got, he's got spunk.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:39.000\nWell, yeah, but somebody, somebody said, there's a community episode we referenced.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:40.000\nWho's the last?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nBut he's following like a thousand 300 people.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.000\nReally?\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nYeah.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:46.000\nSo he, he, he does it.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:47.000\nHe casts a white net.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:50.000\nHe's got, you know who else cast a white net?\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:51.000\nJesus.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:52.000\nJesus.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nYeah.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:57.000\nHe's a fisherman of followers.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nYeah.\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nYeah.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:03.000\nThere's that story about the two footprints and then Jesus says like that was when I was\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nchecking my tumbler.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:07.000\nDumb.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:08.000\nThat was dumb.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:09.000\nBut it was improvised.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nSo it's allowed to be kind of dumb.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:12.000\nIt was so close.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:16.000\nIf you didn't, if you didn't back off it, it would have stood as a good joke.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nYeah.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:21.000\nWell, like if I, like if I, if I hadn't put those like Woody Allen hesitations in there,\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:26.000\nI think that, I think that's the salt on my steak, which is good for me.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:27.000\nI like salty steak.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nBut you hesitate, you hesitate a lot.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:30.000\nYeah.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:31.000\nLike if I, yeah.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nAnd then that's always me salting my food, like for their food, their food.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:36.000\nI saw, I'm putting a little pepper on it, but with my little stammers.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nLike I kind of like, I'm not sure about this.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:39.000\nThey're premeditated.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:40.000\nOh yeah.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nYeah.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nEverything's.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:46.000\nAll the time you're stammering is a huge Woody Allen construct that you have a complete\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nhandle on.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nYeah.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:52.000\nI could, I could talk about anything as if I'm totally confident in myself, but no one\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:53.000\nlikes that.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:54.000\nThat's uncarageable.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nDan, just, just, just to try it out, let's spend the next three or four minutes where\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:58.000\nyou never stammer.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:05.640\nI just, even if the show should, even if the show should suffer for your, for us losing\n\n06:05.640 --> 06:08.000\nthat timing and that, to show you what I mean.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nI will do this for you.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:10.000\nAll right.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:11.000\nNice and clean.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:12.000\nMoving on.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:13.000\nCan we continue with the rest of the podcast?\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nI would love to, Dan.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nAll right.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:24.000\nNow, moving on to our corrections section.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:30.000\nThis is the moment of the show when we correct things that we've done wrong, Jeff, in the\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:31.000\npast.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.300\nAre you implying that we've ever said anything wrong?\n\n06:33.300 --> 06:36.080\nEven things that we think we might have done wrong is worth a correction.\n\n06:36.080 --> 06:39.000\nIt tells the people listening that we care.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:43.000\nAnd by, uh, I don't mean, uh.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:48.000\nYou went to say like, Oh, I'm absolutely positive.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:53.000\nOur first correction is, uh, this is the thing that I wanted to correct.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:58.000\nLast week, Jeff, remember when I mentioned that guy that said that the podcast got him\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nthrough Hurricane Sandy?\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:01.000\nYes.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:04.720\nTo me, it sounded when I listened to it as if I was rolling my eyes when I described\n\n07:04.720 --> 07:05.720\nit a little bit.\n\n07:05.720 --> 07:06.840\nDo you remember what I'm talking about?\n\n07:06.840 --> 07:12.400\nWhen I listened back to it, to me, it sounded as if I was mocking or ironic about how I\n\n07:12.400 --> 07:16.160\nappreciated the guy and how much he liked Harmontown and how he said it had gotten him\n\n07:16.160 --> 07:17.600\nthrough Hurricane Sandy.\n\n07:17.600 --> 07:21.400\nI had a certain patois in my voice.\n\n07:21.400 --> 07:22.400\nI'm sorry.\n\n07:22.400 --> 07:23.400\nI'm sorry.\n\n07:23.400 --> 07:29.400\nI said, uh, at the end of it, I said, and it got him through Hurricane Sandy.\n\n07:29.400 --> 07:34.560\nIt sounded like my head was wiggling and my eyes were rolling and that was absolutely\n\n07:34.560 --> 07:35.560\nnot the intention.\n\n07:35.560 --> 07:37.040\nI was very flattered by this gentleman.\n\n07:37.040 --> 07:38.400\nI spoke with him in the parking lot.\n\n07:38.400 --> 07:40.760\nI had a wonderful time with him.\n\n07:40.760 --> 07:44.880\nSo wherever you are, mister, whatever your name is, I love you.\n\n07:44.880 --> 07:45.880\nWhat's that?\n\n07:45.880 --> 07:46.880\nSomeone say something?\n\n07:46.880 --> 07:47.880\nOf course not.\n\n07:47.880 --> 07:49.400\nThis is a very structured show.\n\n07:49.400 --> 07:54.120\nAnd so far, so far, no stutters.\n\n07:54.120 --> 07:55.120\nYeah.\n\n07:55.120 --> 07:56.760\nAnd don't you think it's gotten more boring?\n\n07:56.760 --> 07:57.760\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n07:57.760 --> 07:58.760\nNo.\n\n07:58.760 --> 07:59.760\nLess charming?\n\n07:59.760 --> 08:00.760\nDon't you trust me less?\n\n08:00.760 --> 08:01.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n08:01.760 --> 08:02.760\nIt's not like Walter Franco.\n\n08:02.760 --> 08:08.320\nI actually think the show is, the show is better when it's clearer and there's more articulation.\n\n08:08.320 --> 08:09.800\nIt's making me very nervous.\n\n08:09.800 --> 08:17.080\nWell, what we've created is a balloon full of tension, and the moment you stutter, it's\n\n08:17.080 --> 08:18.080\ngoing to be a big hit.\n\n08:18.080 --> 08:19.080\nYou're letting it out.\n\n08:19.080 --> 08:20.080\nIt's like a tantrum when you stutter.\n\n08:20.080 --> 08:21.080\nOh, that was almost stutter.\n\n08:21.080 --> 08:22.080\nOh, boy.\n\n08:22.080 --> 08:23.080\nAll right.\n\n08:23.080 --> 08:24.080\nIt's almost.\n\n08:24.080 --> 08:26.080\nMoving on to our next topic.\n\n08:26.080 --> 08:28.080\nAh, yes.\n\n08:28.080 --> 08:38.600\nIs this a topic where you go back in time and talk like somebody from the 1890s?\n\n08:38.600 --> 08:41.320\nWell, this is how people talk when they're not stuttering.\n\n08:41.320 --> 08:43.600\nThey talk like their words are scripted.\n\n08:43.600 --> 08:49.000\nOh, you're on thin ice, but when you start riffing, when you start riffing.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:59.760\nJeff, I was very amused to have a Twitter exchange on Twitter today.\n\n08:59.760 --> 09:04.160\nIn speaking about net neutrality, I threw out what I thought was a reasonable metaphor.\n\n09:04.160 --> 09:10.080\nI was trying to behoove people, god damn it.\n\n09:10.080 --> 09:15.840\nI was trying to get people to understand the importance of gatekeeping within media by\n\n09:15.840 --> 09:30.080\nusing the example of pre-Lutherian Vatican endorsed Latin Bible.\n\n09:30.080 --> 09:34.600\nTo be quite honest, I haven't heard a thing you said since you weren't stuttering because\n\n09:34.600 --> 09:37.920\nI'm trying to be the stutter cop right now.\n\n09:37.920 --> 09:39.480\nWell listen to what I'm saying, Jack.\n\n09:39.480 --> 09:40.480\nAll right.\n\n09:40.480 --> 09:41.480\nJeff.\n\n09:41.480 --> 09:47.800\nI reached in warning about the, you made me do that.\n\n09:47.800 --> 09:51.280\nI said in warning to, I had Max headroomed on the in warning because of what you said\n\n09:51.280 --> 09:52.920\nabout counting my stutters.\n\n09:52.920 --> 09:55.720\nIf I'm conscious of you counting my stutters, I'm going to stutter.\n\n09:55.720 --> 09:56.720\nNow I'm not.\n\n09:56.720 --> 09:57.720\nI let it go.\n\n09:57.720 --> 09:58.720\nAll right.\n\n09:58.720 --> 10:00.440\nNow I have the song queued up.\n\n10:00.440 --> 10:05.880\nIf you do stutter, there is a musical sting that might happen.\n\n10:05.880 --> 10:08.120\nI might have to speak more slowly.\n\n10:08.120 --> 10:09.120\nTake a breath.\n\n10:09.120 --> 10:13.760\nDon't tell me what to do.\n\n10:13.760 --> 10:15.920\nYou see how good that felt and how good that sounded?\n\n10:15.920 --> 10:20.640\nNobody, don't tell me what to do.\n\n10:20.640 --> 10:26.440\nWhen I start stuttering again, I'd like to talk about that impression and how hurtful\n\n10:26.440 --> 10:34.320\nit is, but right now I'm cool as a cucumber and know everything I'm about to say even\n\n10:34.320 --> 10:36.640\nbefore I say it.\n\n10:36.640 --> 10:39.000\nWhat did you make this as a whole show and never stuttered?\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.560\nIt would be boring is my prediction.\n\n10:40.560 --> 10:41.560\nI see.\n\n10:41.560 --> 10:42.560\nI think not.\n\n10:42.560 --> 10:43.560\nI think that I think it would lose something.\n\n10:43.560 --> 10:50.120\nI think it would be like eating a boiled yam as opposed to a fresh crisp right out of\n\n10:50.120 --> 10:51.120\nthe ground.\n\n10:51.120 --> 11:03.840\nEveryone loves a dirty, raw, wonderful, earth-nurtured yam just with the bugs still on it, pull it\n\n11:03.840 --> 11:04.840\nout of the ground.\n\n11:04.840 --> 11:09.640\nAnd asking the question, why did we ever boil yams?\n\n11:09.640 --> 11:10.640\nThese things don't need our help.\n\n11:10.640 --> 11:13.440\nThis is a hate crime, boiling this yam.\n\n11:13.440 --> 11:16.320\nThis thing was perfect.\n\n11:16.320 --> 11:17.680\nGod wanted this in my mouth.\n\n11:17.680 --> 11:24.000\nI can't believe he grew it in the ground.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.200\nNormal people say us sometimes.\n\n11:26.200 --> 11:30.880\nWe're not going to call us or stutter.\n\n11:30.880 --> 11:32.240\nWe're talking about the...\n\n11:32.240 --> 11:35.320\nDan, I'm only going to bust you on...\n\n11:35.320 --> 11:36.320\nNot bust you.\n\n11:36.320 --> 11:38.360\nI'm only going to throw the flag on the play.\n\n11:38.360 --> 11:39.680\nWhen it goes off the rails.\n\n11:39.680 --> 11:40.680\nWhen you go like...\n\n11:40.680 --> 11:42.200\nAlso, I do that too.\n\n11:42.200 --> 11:43.200\nAll right.\n\n11:43.200 --> 11:50.080\nSomeone just laughed like that, guys, laugh as a stutter.\n\n11:50.080 --> 11:52.720\nOkay, what were we talking about?\n\n11:52.720 --> 11:55.120\nCould you please remind me?\n\n11:55.120 --> 11:56.120\nNet neutrality?\n\n11:56.120 --> 11:57.120\nLatin.\n\n11:57.120 --> 11:58.120\nLatin.\n\n11:58.120 --> 11:59.120\nLatin Bible is net neutrality.\n\n11:59.120 --> 12:00.120\nThank you very much.\n\n12:00.120 --> 12:01.120\nYou scattered people.\n\n12:01.120 --> 12:09.120\nIt must be strange to be so unfocused.\n\n12:09.120 --> 12:19.400\nI bet you wish you could speak publicly, anyhow.\n\n12:19.400 --> 12:24.800\nSpeaking about net neutrality on Twitter today, I used that metaphor for the dangers\n\n12:24.800 --> 12:28.160\nof gatekeeping in society.\n\n12:28.160 --> 12:31.640\nRemember when Bibles were only in Latin?\n\n12:31.640 --> 12:33.400\nPoor people couldn't know Latin.\n\n12:33.400 --> 12:37.800\nYou had to access God through another class of people.\n\n12:37.800 --> 12:41.760\nI didn't think anybody thought that that was ever a good thing.\n\n12:41.760 --> 12:49.040\nThis guy took exception to my comments, which I found amazing.\n\n12:49.040 --> 12:50.040\nWhich guy?\n\n12:50.040 --> 12:51.040\nThis guy.\n\n12:51.040 --> 12:52.040\nJust a guy.\n\n12:52.040 --> 12:56.440\nI mean, I have 250,000 followers.\n\n12:56.440 --> 13:01.880\nYou'd expect that if I talked about...\n\n13:01.880 --> 13:08.880\nBraggle, brag.\n\n13:08.880 --> 13:09.880\nExcuse me, sir.\n\n13:09.880 --> 13:12.880\nMy intention was not to hurt your feelings.\n\n13:12.880 --> 13:15.240\nWhat do you mean, which guy?\n\n13:15.240 --> 13:25.640\nBelieve me, sir, the volume of my followership mitigates the quality of my life to burden\n\n13:25.640 --> 13:27.880\nI bear.\n\n13:27.880 --> 13:31.320\nNot bragging, I'm complaining.\n\n13:31.320 --> 13:33.200\nIf I were to talk about papers.\n\n13:33.200 --> 13:36.880\nBy trying not to stammer, you get a little British.\n\n13:36.880 --> 13:39.960\nI'm thinking about what I'm saying.\n\n13:39.960 --> 13:44.440\nMaybe get Game of Thrones or your favorite British character and see if that elongates\n\n13:44.440 --> 13:46.080\nyour vowels and helps you out.\n\n13:46.080 --> 13:47.080\nDon't.\n\n13:47.080 --> 13:48.080\nCome on.\n\n13:48.080 --> 13:49.080\nI'm just trying to help.\n\n13:49.080 --> 13:50.480\nIt seems like you're not trying to help.\n\n13:50.480 --> 13:51.480\nI am.\n\n13:51.480 --> 13:52.880\nNo, I'm absolutely trying to help.\n\n13:52.880 --> 13:58.560\nIt seems like you're Camp Mohawk in meatballs and I'm doing a teacup race.\n\n13:58.560 --> 14:08.680\nFor two people, two people, a lot of gray-haired men pumping their fists right now.\n\n14:08.680 --> 14:10.080\nAnd by a lot, I mean two.\n\n14:10.080 --> 14:11.080\nNo, no.\n\n14:11.080 --> 14:14.640\nI'm definitely the evil ski instructor right now.\n\n14:14.640 --> 14:18.120\nSo you can't make it down the slope, don't?\n\n14:18.120 --> 14:20.320\nDon't frazzle me.\n\n14:20.320 --> 14:21.880\nI'm trying to help.\n\n14:21.880 --> 14:23.160\nI swear to God.\n\n14:23.160 --> 14:35.120\nThis young gentleman was, to me, absurdly defensive of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n14:35.120 --> 14:37.720\nI thought I had seen everything.\n\n14:37.720 --> 14:44.240\nWe are getting dangerously close to the day and you'll call this an exaggeration.\n\n14:44.240 --> 14:48.440\nSome people will call this offensive in and of itself, but it feels as though we are getting\n\n14:48.440 --> 14:53.720\ndangerously close to the day when someone's finally once and for all going to say on the\n\n14:53.720 --> 14:59.200\nInternet, I'm sick and tired of this Hitler metaphor being a can we can just kick whatever\n\n14:59.200 --> 15:01.560\nwe want.\n\n15:01.560 --> 15:04.880\nHitler this, Hitler that, like he's just the definition of bad.\n\n15:04.880 --> 15:10.080\nHow do you think that makes me feel as a Hitler lover?\n\n15:10.080 --> 15:15.520\nWe're getting pretty close to that because this guy was, he was up in arms.\n\n15:15.520 --> 15:23.760\nHe said, I was okay.\n\n15:23.760 --> 15:34.760\nHe said, his point was that he is a Catholic churchgoer.\n\n15:34.760 --> 15:45.360\nAccording to his biography on Twitter, he's a polyglot glottis, what do they call themselves?\n\n15:45.360 --> 15:46.360\nA glottis.\n\n15:46.360 --> 15:47.360\nYes.\n\n15:47.360 --> 15:48.360\nOkay.\n\n15:48.360 --> 15:49.360\nWho speaks multiple languages?\n\n15:49.360 --> 15:50.360\nYeah.\n\n15:50.360 --> 15:51.360\nOne of them being Latin.\n\n15:51.360 --> 15:53.800\nHe goes to Latin mass.\n\n15:53.800 --> 16:03.840\nHe's tired of this stereotype, I think, where people that speak Latin are just a bunch\n\n16:03.840 --> 16:05.840\nof assholes.\n\n16:05.840 --> 16:12.920\nAnd the world history idea that we all learned in world history, maybe this is an American\n\n16:12.920 --> 16:13.920\nthing.\n\n16:13.920 --> 16:14.920\nMaybe this guy lives in Frankfurt.\n\n16:14.920 --> 16:15.920\nMaybe he lives in Rome.\n\n16:15.920 --> 16:17.320\nI don't know.\n\n16:17.320 --> 16:22.320\nBut it made me think, holy cow, really anything.\n\n16:22.320 --> 16:25.640\nNo sooner have you conquered something than something becomes the underdog.\n\n16:25.640 --> 16:34.640\nI was kind of not realizing that I was just using the Vatican as a whipping boy because\n\n16:34.640 --> 16:37.880\nit's an easy, because I thought no one could get offended.\n\n16:37.880 --> 16:41.760\nLike, but what about people who love the Vatican?\n\n16:41.760 --> 16:45.480\nThere's a million of them.\n\n16:45.480 --> 16:48.360\nThere's a couple hundred million of them, I'm sure.\n\n16:48.360 --> 16:50.880\nOr a billion?\n\n16:50.880 --> 16:53.800\nAre you on the side of the Catholic Church now?\n\n16:53.800 --> 16:59.440\nI have always been on the side of anyone who wants to atone with the unknown through a\n\n16:59.440 --> 17:00.640\nreligion of their choosing.\n\n17:00.640 --> 17:05.280\nI would never want to be guilty of impinging on anyone's freedom of religion.\n\n17:05.280 --> 17:06.520\nI think that's terrible.\n\n17:06.520 --> 17:11.000\nThat's why I've stood up here before and it's been kind of weird minefield because we have\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:14.320\na very intelligent group of kids who come to us.\n\n17:14.320 --> 17:17.000\nBy the way, I love you guys.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.840\nYou're my kids.\n\n17:19.840 --> 17:23.200\nExcept for the four gray-haired guys who know meatballs.\n\n17:23.200 --> 17:26.080\nAlso my children.\n\n17:26.080 --> 17:27.080\nAnd I theirs.\n\n17:27.080 --> 17:31.920\nI learned from you guys we are a happy family.\n\n17:31.920 --> 17:36.120\nI would never change a single one of you except Keith in the back.\n\n17:36.120 --> 17:39.080\nI'm just kidding.\n\n17:39.080 --> 17:41.400\nThere's no Keith.\n\n17:41.400 --> 17:43.840\nAre there any Keith's tonight?\n\n17:43.840 --> 17:45.680\nWow.\n\n17:45.680 --> 17:50.720\nI went to Duncan Tressel's live podcast at the Improv.\n\n17:50.720 --> 17:57.920\nI talked a little bit about God there and I got applauded for it.\n\n17:57.920 --> 18:00.360\nYou guys give me a hard time.\n\n18:00.360 --> 18:03.440\nYou're very atheistic.\n\n18:03.440 --> 18:07.960\nVery intelligent, very skeptical people.\n\n18:07.960 --> 18:08.960\nIt's very strange.\n\n18:08.960 --> 18:11.760\nI can't imagine there's going to be a huge overlap between Duncan's audience and this\n\n18:11.760 --> 18:12.760\naudience.\n\n18:12.760 --> 18:14.120\nWhat did you say about God there?\n\n18:14.120 --> 18:18.280\nMaybe they would have applauded the same monologue here.\n\n18:18.280 --> 18:19.280\nYou came down...\n\n18:19.280 --> 18:20.280\nNo, because I...\n\n18:20.280 --> 18:26.960\nYou tried to start your own religion a while ago and you were roundly booed for that.\n\n18:26.960 --> 18:35.360\nI would guess on Duncan Tressel's show you came in a little lower than Jim Jones.\n\n18:35.360 --> 18:36.360\nI can't...\n\n18:36.360 --> 18:40.880\nWell, speaking smoothly, I can't interject and jackhammer you out of this.\n\n18:40.880 --> 18:41.880\nDan, you're off the hook.\n\n18:41.880 --> 18:42.880\nYou made it.\n\n18:42.880 --> 18:43.880\nDan Huffington stuttered.\n\n18:43.880 --> 18:53.040\nThat's the music that would have played if you had stuttered.\n\n18:53.040 --> 18:55.040\nLike mocking asylum music.\n\n18:55.040 --> 18:56.040\nWhat was that?\n\n18:56.040 --> 18:57.040\nWhat was that?\n\n18:57.040 --> 19:12.120\nI don't like that guy.\n\n19:12.120 --> 19:18.040\nThat seems like a boring old school radio.\n\n19:18.040 --> 19:22.320\nBecause it was so measured, it sounded really intimidating that you were holding something\n\n19:22.320 --> 19:27.360\nback that might have... you were not saying what you really meant.\n\n19:27.360 --> 19:28.360\nYeah.\n\n19:28.360 --> 19:29.360\nYeah.\n\n19:29.360 --> 19:30.360\nIt was scary.\n\n19:30.360 --> 19:31.360\nI don't like...\n\n19:31.360 --> 19:32.360\nI prefer the other version.\n\n19:32.360 --> 19:35.480\nYeah, you want to know what's for sale here, what's going on behind my ears.\n\n19:35.480 --> 19:38.920\nNo one came here because I went to broadcasting school.\n\n19:38.920 --> 19:47.120\nI did not slave for hours, years, decades, millennia in the stand-up minds.\n\n19:47.120 --> 19:49.600\nYou noticed that you haven't stuttered since we stopped?\n\n19:49.600 --> 19:53.120\nIt's like, I'll do it on purpose, but whatever.\n\n19:53.120 --> 20:00.680\nBut I'm just saying, when I want to find the words, whatever, how did we get on this?\n\n20:00.680 --> 20:01.680\nWhat is this?\n\n20:01.680 --> 20:03.640\nIt wasn't us making fun of you stammering.\n\n20:03.640 --> 20:06.080\nI stammer instead or it mumbled and all kinds of shit.\n\n20:06.080 --> 20:08.080\nIt was an experiment.\n\n20:08.080 --> 20:09.080\nAll right.\n\n20:09.080 --> 20:10.080\nThat's not all right.\n\n20:10.080 --> 20:15.080\nGod and atheism and memos.\n\n20:15.080 --> 20:16.080\nRight.\n\n20:16.080 --> 20:17.080\nWell, yeah.\n\n20:17.080 --> 20:18.080\nI mean, you guys.\n\n20:18.080 --> 20:26.120\nWell, you're accusing this crowd of hating you, loving God, or hating you, hating God?\n\n20:26.120 --> 20:34.640\nOur crowd has a little bit, Duncan talks a lot about religious pursuits on his podcast.\n\n20:34.640 --> 20:36.280\nHe has religious experiences.\n\n20:36.280 --> 20:44.280\nHe's really into ramdas and eating things that make you see that sheep are watching.\n\n20:44.280 --> 20:45.880\nHe reads books.\n\n20:45.880 --> 20:48.240\nYeah, mushroom Jesus thing.\n\n20:48.240 --> 20:49.240\nYeah.\n\n20:49.240 --> 20:52.040\nAnd so his crowd includes more.\n\n20:52.040 --> 21:05.120\nI think the fringe of his audience, I picture, is being genuinely almost tie-dyed in silhouette.\n\n21:05.120 --> 21:06.120\nTie-dyed in silhouette?\n\n21:06.120 --> 21:09.600\nI was trying to think of tie-dyed in- That's the most poetic thing you've ever said.\n\n21:09.600 --> 21:12.600\nI should have just said tie-dyed.\n\n21:12.600 --> 21:21.640\nAnd then the fringe of our audience, I think, has actual surgically augmented pointed ears.\n\n21:21.640 --> 21:25.640\nThese are fringes, and I love all of those people.\n\n21:25.640 --> 21:29.920\nI don't know who of those two I love more, but those two, and sometimes you might see\n\n21:29.920 --> 21:35.640\na really nice, fun road movie about those two having to cross the country together.\n\n21:35.640 --> 21:39.720\nThey often travel in the same circles because neither of them would judge each other.\n\n21:39.720 --> 21:44.480\nBut one guy is like, hmm, I beg to differ about the thing that you said the other day.\n\n21:44.480 --> 21:49.080\nI did some research myself, and then the other guy is like, yeah, that's what I keep saying.\n\n21:49.080 --> 21:51.080\nLet's get naked.\n\n21:51.080 --> 21:53.840\nNo, Keith, we're not.\n\n21:53.840 --> 21:58.760\nStop pushing your nude agenda.\n\n21:58.760 --> 22:00.000\nYou look great in tie-dyed.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:03.080\nLeave it at that.\n\n22:03.080 --> 22:07.440\nAnd I was just like, in that show, I don't know, we were talking about writing in the\n\n22:07.440 --> 22:08.440\ncreative process.\n\n22:08.440 --> 22:16.080\nI got a little spiritual about it, and I felt less punished than I do here sometimes.\n\n22:16.080 --> 22:17.080\nIt's because you're smart.\n\n22:17.080 --> 22:20.640\nWhy is Duncan Trussell's audience?\n\n22:20.640 --> 22:23.720\nNo, they're not the opposite of smart.\n\n22:23.720 --> 22:27.120\nI was trying to make them feel better, not make other people feel worse.\n\n22:27.120 --> 22:30.000\nI shouldn't have gone down this road.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:34.800\nBoy, that guy that defended Latin, what an asshole.\n\n22:34.800 --> 22:39.960\nHis angle was he's tired of having Latin kicked around the block?\n\n22:39.960 --> 22:47.120\nYeah, I mean, I would happily do like, if somebody could pull up the Twitter conversation,\n\n22:47.120 --> 22:50.880\nwe could do like a love letters thing.\n\n22:50.880 --> 22:53.200\nBut I lack the facility.\n\n22:53.200 --> 22:59.600\nI think I'm just looking at my Evernote thing, which I think is, it's all tapped, except\n\n22:59.600 --> 23:03.600\nfor Aaron went to this camp the last three days.\n\n23:03.600 --> 23:11.680\nAaron was at a special camp for hipsters, I think, it's called Server Lake.\n\n23:11.680 --> 23:18.200\nThat sounds dismissive, I think it's better to say it was a camp for hipsters instead\n\n23:18.200 --> 23:23.920\nof saying what it is so that you're silently in your head going, so a hipster camp?\n\n23:23.920 --> 23:33.200\nI think they were very activated young independent business entrepreneurs who were teaching\n\n23:33.200 --> 23:40.080\neach other and learning from each other how to live in a new world business-wise on the\n\n23:40.080 --> 23:44.320\ninternet and whittle and make s'mores.\n\n23:44.320 --> 23:50.240\nThey did camp stuff, but they were doing camp stuff and having seminars and stuff.\n\n23:50.240 --> 23:56.920\nBut weirdly, counter-intuitively, whereas if you go to XOXO, it's like, holy shit, here's\n\n23:56.920 --> 24:01.160\nyour hashtag, here's your thing, I mean, because obviously we're fucking, this conference is\n\n24:01.160 --> 24:07.920\nabout technology, we encourage you to gram it and tumble it and flip it, flip it, it's\n\n24:07.920 --> 24:23.440\nface nipple, it's new, it's face nipple, N-I-P-P-L, but in brackets, with a two after it for\n\n24:23.440 --> 24:26.800\nno reason.\n\n24:26.800 --> 24:30.600\nBut this place, they took their phones.\n\n24:30.600 --> 24:31.600\nWhere was this place?\n\n24:31.600 --> 24:32.600\nAnd they never gave them back.\n\n24:32.600 --> 24:36.040\nThey had to whittle new phones before they were allowed to leave.\n\n24:36.040 --> 24:39.880\nUntil you tell me, or Erin tells me otherwise, I'm imagining they're all on TPs up in Big\n\n24:39.880 --> 24:40.880\nBear.\n\n24:40.880 --> 24:41.880\nIt was Big Bear.\n\n24:41.880 --> 24:42.880\nReally?\n\n24:42.880 --> 24:43.880\nYeah.\n\n24:43.880 --> 24:47.040\nI know, because Erin left her luggage there.\n\n24:47.040 --> 24:48.120\nAnd I said, where was this place?\n\n24:48.120 --> 24:49.120\nI didn't even know where she was.\n\n24:49.120 --> 24:51.120\nIt occurred to me like, what if she had gotten hurt?\n\n24:51.120 --> 24:54.680\nWait, you could bring luggage but not a phone, and it's in Big Bear.\n\n24:54.680 --> 24:58.680\nYeah, you could bring your phone, but it's gone for three days.\n\n24:58.680 --> 25:00.680\nShe's staying at Tent?\n\n25:00.680 --> 25:01.680\nWhat happened?\n\n25:01.680 --> 25:04.120\nThat's a question she'll have to answer.\n\n25:04.120 --> 25:08.560\nBut also, she had, I knew she'd come back with one good story.\n\n25:08.560 --> 25:14.440\nMy definition of a good story is always a lot of Schadenfreude and pain, and like, just\n\n25:14.440 --> 25:16.680\nunfairness happening in front of everybody.\n\n25:16.680 --> 25:18.680\nWhat's the name of this convention or this camp?\n\n25:18.680 --> 25:24.880\nAnd I want to know how it all began, and is this the first or 17th year, or like, I want\n\n25:24.880 --> 25:25.880\nto know all about it.\n\n25:25.880 --> 25:27.400\nWell, she'll give you all the details.\n\n25:27.400 --> 25:29.400\nWhy don't we just bring her up?\n\n25:29.400 --> 25:34.400\nErin, are you...\n\n25:34.400 --> 25:49.400\nI wish that I'd gone out for ten minutes.\n\n25:49.400 --> 26:02.120\nWorld's Best Podcast!\n\n26:02.120 --> 26:11.360\nShe was staring off into space like an autistic six-year-old while doing a Bobby Brown-derived\n\n26:11.360 --> 26:12.360\nHoochie...\n\n26:12.360 --> 26:13.360\nSoul train.\n\n26:13.360 --> 26:14.360\nHoochie...\n\n26:14.360 --> 26:15.360\nHoochie Giration.\n\n26:15.360 --> 26:16.360\nYeah.\n\n26:16.360 --> 26:24.480\nBut it was combined with a strange final episode of St. Elsewhere, just chasing off to the\n\n26:24.480 --> 26:28.000\npoint where I thought it was going to be one of those stories where, and then we realized\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.880\nshe was an insulin shock, and we didn't know she would...\n\n26:30.880 --> 26:34.000\nThat's when we took her to the emergency room, and they said, she's been diabetic for six\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:35.000\nyears.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:36.000\nOh, boy.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:40.800\nBut last night, at the last night of camp, there was a dance, and it was future-themed,\n\n26:40.800 --> 26:41.800\nso I dressed as...\n\n26:41.800 --> 26:42.800\nAll right, guys.\n\n26:42.800 --> 26:43.800\nI dressed...\n\n26:43.800 --> 26:44.800\nI dressed as...\n\n26:44.800 --> 26:50.440\nI dressed as Barf from Spaceballs, and I bought...\n\n26:50.440 --> 26:51.840\nI bought this giant...\n\n26:51.840 --> 26:54.680\nA lot of Spaceballs fans out there.\n\n26:54.680 --> 26:59.800\nI bought this giant cover-all thing in, like, 7X, because I wanted...\n\n26:59.800 --> 27:03.840\nI was going to stuff it, but I didn't, and I realized halfway through the dance that\n\n27:03.840 --> 27:09.120\nyou couldn't see my body moving, like, I was working so hard to dance, but it just looked\n\n27:09.120 --> 27:10.120\nlike I was...\n\n27:10.120 --> 27:13.320\nIt was all covered up.\n\n27:13.320 --> 27:14.320\nLike a bobble head?\n\n27:14.320 --> 27:15.320\nYeah.\n\n27:15.320 --> 27:18.280\nAnd I was drunk, and I, like, took a rope, and I was, like, trying to tie it around my\n\n27:18.280 --> 27:21.040\nwaist, and I was trying to explain to people, like, I've been dancing.\n\n27:21.040 --> 27:23.040\nI've been cheating you of moves.\n\n27:23.040 --> 27:25.760\nIt's got to get a leash around them so you can...\n\n27:25.760 --> 27:27.400\nIf I can take them around.\n\n27:27.400 --> 27:31.080\nI've been jigging the whole time.\n\n27:31.080 --> 27:37.160\nSo the camp, it's put on by this really great organization in LA called Unique LA.\n\n27:37.160 --> 27:40.560\nSo you know what I'm familiar with, Unique LA?\n\n27:40.560 --> 27:44.560\nYeah!\n\n27:44.560 --> 27:46.560\nThey have a building...\n\n27:46.560 --> 27:49.160\nAnd the crowd went, whoa.\n\n27:49.160 --> 27:53.920\nThey have a building called the Unique Space in downtown LA, and it's just about, like,\n\n27:53.920 --> 27:58.520\nI don't know, a cultivating community between, like, artists and entrepreneurs, and they\n\n27:58.520 --> 28:01.240\ndo a lot of, like, made in LA type things.\n\n28:01.240 --> 28:08.560\nAnd so the camp is called the Unique Camp, and it's a camp...\n\n28:08.560 --> 28:16.680\nOur acronym is Cultivate Ambition Map Possibilities.\n\n28:16.680 --> 28:17.680\nI mean, come on, haters.\n\n28:17.680 --> 28:18.680\nChill out.\n\n28:18.680 --> 28:19.680\nChill out.\n\n28:19.680 --> 28:20.680\nChill out.\n\n28:20.680 --> 28:21.680\nThey hate God, too.\n\n28:21.680 --> 28:22.680\nWell...\n\n28:22.680 --> 28:23.680\nCultivate...\n\n28:23.680 --> 28:26.640\nCultivate Ambition Map Possibilities, just because they wanted to...\n\n28:26.640 --> 28:28.640\nBasically, it's, like, it's just people that love...\n\n28:28.640 --> 28:29.640\nThey wanted to spell the word for you.\n\n28:29.640 --> 28:30.640\nIt's people that love...\n\n28:30.640 --> 28:31.640\nChocolate, almonds, marzipan...\n\n28:31.640 --> 28:32.640\nCreate them.\n\n28:32.640 --> 28:38.800\n...Porsche, ambitious, multi-ethnic progress.\n\n28:38.800 --> 28:46.280\nIt's basically just this very fun, camp-themed thing where different, like, creative people\n\n28:46.280 --> 28:47.280\nthat are...\n\n28:47.280 --> 28:50.160\nIt's mostly, like, self-made people that are artists and business...\n\n28:50.160 --> 28:52.280\nI really had no business being there, like, over...\n\n28:52.280 --> 28:55.280\nI kept on changing my introduction, because I get every...\n\n28:55.280 --> 29:00.760\nIn every group, you have to say, like, I'm so-and-so, and I founded Eco Shoes, and I'm, like, I\n\n29:00.760 --> 29:05.640\nam Aaron, and I invented calcium.\n\n29:05.640 --> 29:10.240\nI was the fireman with the GoPro on his head when that kitten got oxygen.\n\n29:10.240 --> 29:12.680\nI assume that was more viral than maybe it was.\n\n29:12.680 --> 29:14.480\nNo, it's pretty viral.\n\n29:14.480 --> 29:15.480\nYeah.\n\n29:15.480 --> 29:16.480\nWhat was yours?\n\n29:16.480 --> 29:17.480\nWhat was yours, Aaron?\n\n29:17.480 --> 29:19.480\nJeff went, then I went.\n\n29:19.480 --> 29:23.880\nNow it's your turn to make fun of you.\n\n29:23.880 --> 29:26.480\nBut it's very neat, if you're...\n\n29:26.480 --> 29:27.480\nLook at that.\n\n29:27.480 --> 29:31.520\nYou said you changed your introduction.\n\n29:31.520 --> 29:34.360\nWhat was the evolution of your introductions?\n\n29:34.360 --> 29:35.360\nHumiliating.\n\n29:35.360 --> 29:36.360\nIt says humiliating.\n\n29:36.360 --> 29:41.240\nWell, I think my first introduction, I said, I do...\n\n29:41.240 --> 29:43.240\nHi, I'm Erin McGathy.\n\n29:43.240 --> 29:44.240\nI do...\n\n29:44.240 --> 29:48.120\nI mean, because of the truth, I went because I have all these different interests, and\n\n29:48.120 --> 29:51.400\nI have my fingers in so many different pies, and I guess technically I'm a freelancer,\n\n29:51.400 --> 29:55.280\nbut I have my podcasts and performing, but I make things, and so I'm just trying to, like,\n\n29:55.280 --> 29:57.400\nfigure that all out.\n\n29:57.400 --> 30:03.240\nSo that's why I went just for fun, and I also live summer camp.\n\n30:03.240 --> 30:04.640\nI just got back a couple hours ago.\n\n30:04.640 --> 30:08.480\nI'm very sunburnt, and I feel a little woozy from the elevators.\n\n30:08.480 --> 30:11.160\nWhat was the list of things that you introduced yourself to?\n\n30:11.160 --> 30:12.160\nOkay, okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n30:12.160 --> 30:15.840\nDriving up there in the car, your introduction that you had planned for it, was what?\n\n30:15.840 --> 30:17.160\nWell, I had no...\n\n30:17.160 --> 30:20.520\nI did not plan an introduction.\n\n30:20.520 --> 30:25.320\nI was very intimidated by the groups because, like I'm saying, there was an astronomer who\n\n30:25.320 --> 30:30.280\nstudies black holes at Dartmouth, and there is, like, you know, all these people that\n\n30:30.280 --> 30:33.960\nhave created all these things that a lot of you guys, I'm sure, use.\n\n30:33.960 --> 30:34.960\nBut at my...\n\n30:34.960 --> 30:35.960\nSo I was like, hi, I'm Erin.\n\n30:35.960 --> 30:44.200\nI do comedy, and like stuff, and sometimes I bake a cake, and I'm like, okay.\n\n30:44.200 --> 30:49.640\nAnd then I, like, you know, once I wrote something, so I was like, I'm a writer, but, like, not\n\n30:49.640 --> 30:50.640\nreally...\n\n30:50.640 --> 30:54.440\nNot actively, but like, okay.\n\n30:54.440 --> 30:56.760\nThat's going to be so annoying to hear on the podcast, I'm sorry, listeners.\n\n30:56.760 --> 30:59.720\nI hate it when I do that bobcat voice.\n\n30:59.720 --> 31:03.360\nYeah, so I refined it to...\n\n31:03.360 --> 31:07.360\nI host a podcast called This Feels Terrible, and I do with these other things, and I want\n\n31:07.360 --> 31:11.960\nto kind of bring them all together and figure out how to, like, cultivate the community\n\n31:11.960 --> 31:12.960\nof that.\n\n31:12.960 --> 31:13.960\nSo...\n\n31:13.960 --> 31:14.960\nAll right.\n\n31:14.960 --> 31:15.960\nSo...\n\n31:15.960 --> 31:16.960\nTook Erin after dinner.\n\n31:16.960 --> 31:17.960\nThey didn't take her out.\n\n31:17.960 --> 31:18.960\nShe took me out.\n\n31:18.960 --> 31:19.960\nThey took each other out.\n\n31:19.960 --> 31:20.960\nYou took me out.\n\n31:20.960 --> 31:21.960\nI paid for ballet.\n\n31:21.960 --> 31:22.960\nAll right.\n\n31:22.960 --> 31:23.960\nYeah.\n\n31:23.960 --> 31:24.960\nYeah.\n\n31:24.960 --> 31:30.600\nI mean, we were, we haven't been apart more than, well, this is probably the longest we've\n\n31:30.600 --> 31:31.600\never been apart, right?\n\n31:31.600 --> 31:34.280\nYeah, and definitely the longest without talking.\n\n31:34.280 --> 31:39.240\nAnd I was so excited, because I knew something, there's got to be something, and you did not\n\n31:39.240 --> 31:43.560\ndisappoint after a lot of boring stuff about this hunky astronomer guy that swept you\n\n31:43.560 --> 31:44.560\noff your feet.\n\n31:44.560 --> 31:45.560\nHe never...\n\n31:45.560 --> 31:50.600\nHis name is Kevin, and he's...\n\n31:50.600 --> 31:51.600\nHe's amazing.\n\n31:51.600 --> 31:53.200\nHe's going to be my next guest on This Feels Terrible.\n\n31:53.200 --> 31:54.200\nHe's really incredible.\n\n31:54.200 --> 31:57.040\nHe, like, knows all this stuff about black holes, and he's a huge fan of Rick and Morty,\n\n31:57.040 --> 31:58.040\nand...\n\n31:58.040 --> 32:00.680\nWhich is supposed to make me feel good when he's fucking you.\n\n32:00.680 --> 32:03.520\nHi, honey, I'm Hump.\n\n32:03.520 --> 32:06.200\nYou better love my cartoon, mister!\n\n32:06.200 --> 32:12.040\nFinish up and get out of here, or stay.\n\n32:12.040 --> 32:14.200\nWe'll play catchphrase later.\n\n32:14.200 --> 32:18.480\nOh, and Jeff, I made a bunch of people play catchphrase, so alienated.\n\n32:18.480 --> 32:20.400\nA lot of people have the rules.\n\n32:20.400 --> 32:21.400\nWho ran it?\n\n32:21.400 --> 32:22.400\nWell, come on.\n\n32:22.400 --> 32:23.400\nAnyway, anyway.\n\n32:23.400 --> 32:24.400\nThe horse story.\n\n32:24.400 --> 32:25.400\nThe horse story.\n\n32:25.400 --> 32:26.400\nThe horse story.\n\n32:26.400 --> 32:27.400\nThe horse story.\n\n32:27.400 --> 32:28.400\nThe horse story.\n\n32:28.400 --> 32:29.400\nOkay, so...\n\n32:29.400 --> 32:32.160\nI think this is like, to me, this is like a parable.\n\n32:32.160 --> 32:33.160\nWhat happened?\n\n32:33.160 --> 32:34.160\nI mean, you're building it up.\n\n32:34.160 --> 32:37.960\nI'm going to make myself comfortable.\n\n32:37.960 --> 32:38.960\nSo yesterday...\n\n32:38.960 --> 32:39.960\nI...\n\n32:39.960 --> 32:46.160\nYou know what, guys, I'm just going to be myself, and myself wants to be comfortable.\n\n32:46.160 --> 32:47.400\nSo yesterday...\n\n32:47.400 --> 32:50.880\nDid you learn that at camp?\n\n32:50.880 --> 32:57.640\nTechnically, she learned it from Kevin, under the stars.\n\n32:57.640 --> 33:00.320\nGravity is like just another stool under your feet.\n\n33:00.320 --> 33:01.600\nThat's Cassiopeia up there.\n\n33:01.600 --> 33:04.120\nYou know, she sacrificed herself for her lover.\n\n33:04.120 --> 33:11.120\nOh, I wish I knew someone...\n\n33:11.120 --> 33:12.640\nSpeaking of holes.\n\n33:12.640 --> 33:17.400\nKevin, the stars are under my blouse.\n\n33:17.400 --> 33:23.280\nI definitely have the glow of camp, Dan didn't recognize me when I came to the car.\n\n33:23.280 --> 33:27.520\nYou were wearing this knit shawl, is that an accurate description?\n\n33:27.520 --> 33:28.520\nYeah.\n\n33:28.520 --> 33:30.200\nLike a knit shawl and a baseball cap.\n\n33:30.200 --> 33:33.320\nBecause I want a scavenger hunt, so I got a baseball cap.\n\n33:33.320 --> 33:38.080\nI looked right at her, and then just went right back to listening to Radiolab waiting\n\n33:38.080 --> 33:43.240\nfor my fiance to come to the car, and then the car door opened, and I went, ah!\n\n33:43.240 --> 33:50.200\nThis knit shawl scavenger from Sector 7, this person that was dressed unlike anything I'd\n\n33:50.200 --> 33:57.360\never seen Erin in, like coming into my car, I was like, oh my god, you're not the strange...\n\n33:57.360 --> 33:58.360\nI don't know.\n\n33:58.360 --> 34:05.040\nFor some reason, I have no idea what happened, but in my head, you were an Asian woman.\n\n34:05.040 --> 34:08.920\nI just projected a race onto you.\n\n34:08.920 --> 34:13.040\nI don't know if to me that's an Asian shawl, or I don't know what was in my head, because\n\n34:13.040 --> 34:14.040\nobviously...\n\n34:14.040 --> 34:19.240\nAll those knit shawl, ball cap, wearing Asians, I mean, let's not...\n\n34:19.240 --> 34:25.360\nSo, like Dan was saying, at the camp, there are all these camp activities that you could\n\n34:25.360 --> 34:30.360\ndo in addition to these workshops, and I signed up for horseback riding, and it was the last\n\n34:30.360 --> 34:35.320\nhorseback riding session of the weekend, this was last night, and they said on the\n\n34:35.320 --> 34:40.920\nsheet, come right at five o'clock, because, you know, they didn't explain why.\n\n34:40.920 --> 34:46.920\nTake our word for it, you want to ride a horse, there's an appointment involved.\n\n34:46.920 --> 34:51.080\nAnd I was very excited, so I was like 10 minutes early, and was like, you know, looking at\n\n34:51.080 --> 34:56.800\nthe horses and, you know, imagining which one I would ride, and there were like 10 other\n\n34:56.800 --> 35:00.160\nwomen who showed up exactly on time.\n\n35:00.160 --> 35:06.880\nWe get this talk from the horse training person who says, yeah, I'm so glad you guys\n\n35:06.880 --> 35:10.840\nare here on time, because it's so important for us all to be here on time, and I'll hear\n\n35:10.840 --> 35:16.120\nthis explanation together, because these horses are very particular, and we get on these logs\n\n35:16.120 --> 35:17.120\nwith...\n\n35:17.120 --> 35:19.360\nWhat do you call horse ropes?\n\n35:19.360 --> 35:20.360\nRains.\n\n35:20.360 --> 35:21.360\nRains.\n\n35:21.360 --> 35:22.360\nRains.\n\n35:22.360 --> 35:23.360\nOr leaders.\n\n35:23.360 --> 35:24.360\nRains.\n\n35:24.360 --> 35:25.360\nOkay.\n\n35:25.360 --> 35:26.360\nSo we...\n\n35:26.360 --> 35:27.360\nHorse ropes.\n\n35:27.360 --> 35:29.360\nThey should just call them horse ropes, for God's sake.\n\n35:29.360 --> 35:32.920\nWell, I'm sure there's a lot of ropes used with horses.\n\n35:32.920 --> 35:38.680\nSo we're sitting on these logs, we go through this entire training session with this woman,\n\n35:38.680 --> 35:45.160\nand we see somebody walking from the camp, because the horse stuff is kind of far away\n\n35:45.160 --> 35:47.480\nfrom the bunks and everything.\n\n35:47.480 --> 35:52.560\nWe see someone walking, and the leader waves at her, and is like, are you...\n\n35:52.560 --> 35:58.360\nHorse, and she just kind of casually waves back, and she does a hurry, and the woman\n\n35:58.360 --> 36:03.520\njust walks at her same pace, like she's a very fit, athletic, young woman, just like\n\n36:03.520 --> 36:06.520\nwalking slowly while she's going over this thing.\n\n36:06.520 --> 36:10.400\nSo the instructor's like, okay, we'll move on, and clearly this person's just taking\n\n36:10.400 --> 36:13.040\na walk and was waving.\n\n36:13.040 --> 36:17.920\nEventually this woman arrives, and she's come after the entire explanation, and the\n\n36:17.920 --> 36:24.600\nleader, the horse instructor lady said, oh, she's about to say, sorry, you can't ride\n\n36:24.600 --> 36:29.040\nwith us, because you've missed the explanation, and we have to go now.\n\n36:29.040 --> 36:34.320\nAnd she's like, hey, and the woman's like, oh, don't worry, I ride, I'm very comfortable\n\n36:34.320 --> 36:36.040\nto the horse instructor lady.\n\n36:36.040 --> 36:43.160\nAnd we're all like, oh, God, I'm just very, so proud, and so shitty, and very comfortable.\n\n36:43.160 --> 36:48.280\nAnd then the woman's like, oh, but you need to, like, I'll go over the stuff with you,\n\n36:48.280 --> 36:49.280\nbecause just legally you have to.\n\n36:49.280 --> 36:57.240\nBut even if she was an expert, like, Steeple Chase Olympian, we already know two things\n\n36:57.240 --> 36:58.240\nabout this stranger.\n\n36:58.240 --> 37:03.800\nOne is that she may or may not know anything about horses, but we know she knows nothing\n\n37:03.800 --> 37:06.400\nabout group dynamics.\n\n37:06.400 --> 37:12.360\nShe has walked into a group of people who have, she's 15 minutes late, and she's just\n\n37:12.360 --> 37:17.520\nannouncing to all of these strangers here, it's all right, I'm an expert.\n\n37:17.520 --> 37:22.760\nAlso, I've been around enough horse lady instructors to know that the first 15 minutes\n\n37:22.760 --> 37:23.760\nis all bullshit.\n\n37:23.760 --> 37:28.960\nI'll get there when the horse ride starts.\n\n37:28.960 --> 37:32.200\nThe horses tend to learn a thing or two from me, tell you the truth.\n\n37:32.200 --> 37:37.600\nAnd also, the instructions were a favor to all of us, which they are.\n\n37:37.600 --> 37:38.600\nAs we will learn.\n\n37:38.600 --> 37:39.600\nYeah.\n\n37:39.600 --> 37:47.840\nSo we all were assigned horses, and as they're assigning horses, the horse instructor lady,\n\n37:47.840 --> 37:55.000\nthe hill, says, it's very important when we go out that we stay in the line that we\n\n37:55.000 --> 38:00.240\ngo out in, because horses are like people, and they dislike some horses, and they like\n\n38:00.240 --> 38:03.960\nother horses, and some of these horses are very particular, and it's very important that\n\n38:03.960 --> 38:06.000\nyou stay in this specific line.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:11.200\nSo we know that we get on our horse, my horse's name is Bergen.\n\n38:11.200 --> 38:13.560\nSo we're sitting, sorry, I was just thinking about Bergen.\n\n38:13.560 --> 38:14.560\nBergen.\n\n38:14.560 --> 38:15.560\nBergen.\n\n38:15.560 --> 38:18.080\nSo we get on the horses, and I know that during this time, she's going over this explanation\n\n38:18.080 --> 38:21.160\nwith this woman who's ridden horses and is very comfortable.\n\n38:21.160 --> 38:27.200\nWe get on the horses, there's a pin where you go in a circle, just so you get used\n\n38:27.200 --> 38:30.600\nto controlling her horse and going in this line.\n\n38:30.600 --> 38:35.640\nSo she, the horse instructor lady leads us out in this line, and we start going around\n\n38:35.640 --> 38:36.640\nin the circle.\n\n38:36.640 --> 38:41.320\nI'm second in this line, and this woman who is very comfortable in horses is kind of\n\n38:41.320 --> 38:44.480\ntowards the back of this line of 10 horses.\n\n38:44.480 --> 38:47.920\nWe're going this line, like from the very beginning, the horse instructor lady is saying\n\n38:47.920 --> 38:55.640\nto the, I'm going to call her Blondie, she's blonde, so she says to Blondie, no, no, you're\n\n38:55.640 --> 39:01.000\nout of line, because her horse was going in the middle of the ring.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:04.880\nEverybody else is in this line, and this woman who's so familiar and comfortable with horses,\n\n39:04.880 --> 39:09.760\nher horse is kind of veering out, and the lady is like, no, no, no, you need to go back,\n\n39:09.760 --> 39:13.760\nyou need to go back, and she's not, she's trying, and she says, you need to go back,\n\n39:13.760 --> 39:18.840\nand then Blondie says, look, I heard you.\n\n39:18.840 --> 39:25.480\nShe's put off by all the, all right already, I don't know how to ride a horse, I get it.\n\n39:25.480 --> 39:30.720\nBut the woman's like, no, it's just actually important, like the, the, the, is she leaving\n\n39:30.720 --> 39:36.520\nher horse, is she coloring outside the lines, like, she's, I don't know, yeah, she's like,\n\n39:36.520 --> 39:39.280\nyou know what, this is beginner's shit, this horse is going to ride an elephant, while\n\n39:39.280 --> 39:44.480\nI ride the horse, I don't know, where's the, yeah, well, and while, because she's out\n\n39:44.480 --> 39:49.840\nof the line, the order gets all fucked up, because the horses are used to like traveling\n\n39:49.840 --> 39:55.120\npretty close to each other, so we're on our second, go around this ring, we're about to\n\n39:55.120 --> 40:01.200\ngo out on the trail, we're coming around the, the, the side of it, and she's, the Blondie\n\n40:01.200 --> 40:05.640\nis trying to get her horse back into this line of horses, and as she does that, she\n\n40:05.640 --> 40:11.240\nspooks the horse in front of her, and the horse freaks out, I've never seen anything\n\n40:11.240 --> 40:19.800\nlike this, the, the horse gets really scared, and horses are big, big, as big as a horse.\n\n40:19.800 --> 40:26.800\nThey can eat a smaller horse. When they get hungry, they just lick their hooves, so they,\n\n40:26.800 --> 40:34.760\nso, so, so the horse gets super spooked, and it throws this nice mother off of the horse,\n\n40:34.760 --> 40:39.680\nbucks, and like, she falls to the ground, the horse is going, nyeh!\n\n40:39.680 --> 40:45.520\nNow, try again, try again. It's okay to get it wrong the first time.\n\n40:45.520 --> 40:52.080\nWe just find out you don't know an old, even, even in a speak and spell, and I, I, I really\n\n40:52.080 --> 40:56.000\ntry to go, try to put yourself back in that moment and do the horse, I, I really thought\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:59.280\nI was going to have a Michael Winslow moment. I thought that was going to be really amazing.\n\n40:59.280 --> 41:02.880\nJust let, let it go, just try, try it one more time, it's like, like, like, the, the,\n\n41:02.880 --> 41:17.840\nthe mother. I think that's a swamp horse, I think we're, I think there was a loon, certainly\n\n41:17.840 --> 41:23.480\na loon. All right, so, so a woman, a woman is dead or maimed or something like that.\n\n41:23.480 --> 41:28.320\nShe gets thrown off the horse, and the, like, everybody's silent, and the, the instructor's\n\n41:28.320 --> 41:32.280\nlike, still, still, everyone be still, everyone be still, don't move, don't move, and she has\n\n41:32.280 --> 41:36.920\nto jump off her horse and calm down this horse and keep her from smashing in this mother's\n\n41:36.920 --> 41:44.280\nhead. And, and so she, she calms down the horses, everybody's silent, she's still telling\n\n41:44.280 --> 41:50.560\nthe women to be quiet, she takes the spooked horse back into the stable, and then, and\n\n41:50.560 --> 41:54.840\nthen we all follow suit, this woman is still, still on the ground, so I don't, we don't know\n\n41:54.840 --> 41:58.640\nif she's like, if she's dead or if she's just being still because she's, she needs to be\n\n41:58.640 --> 42:03.760\nsafe, obviously. We get all our horses tied up, and then she's, like, I call out like,\n\n42:03.760 --> 42:09.800\nare you okay? Not that I'm the hero, but I asked her if she was okay. She, she was okay,\n\n42:09.800 --> 42:14.080\nthey called the medics over, and she was fine, she was bruised up, she was just still because\n\n42:14.080 --> 42:18.000\nshe was, she was, she was told that she was supposed to be still, and we get all tied\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:22.480\nup with the horses, and everyone is, I mean, I know, I don't know how everyone is feeling,\n\n42:22.480 --> 42:27.680\nI was feeling so happy that this woman's head wasn't smashed in, and I hear Blondie\n\n42:27.680 --> 42:36.240\non the other side of the stable say, sorry not going out?\n\n42:36.240 --> 42:46.520\nShe can't get a break! I had the shittiest day today. They started horse class too early,\n\n42:46.520 --> 42:53.160\nthen the bitch teaching it tells me I gotta learn it anyway, then some other bitch's horse\n\n42:53.160 --> 42:58.600\nthrows her off. Like, what's, when's it gonna be Natalie time?\n\n42:58.600 --> 43:01.600\nNatalie time!\n\n43:01.600 --> 43:04.600\nWhat do you think her deal was? Do you think that she used to ever ride a horse, or that\n\n43:04.600 --> 43:07.760\nshe was cocky, and she was just like, or she just was full of shit?\n\n43:07.760 --> 43:08.760\nI mean, I...\n\n43:08.760 --> 43:11.200\nAlso, what business does she start? I want to know about that.\n\n43:11.200 --> 43:17.160\nIt's an overused term, but I'm gonna go sociopath, I'm gonna say her general problem is that she\n\n43:17.160 --> 43:23.920\nhas no fucking empathy. Or was she like, such a good horse, but I was like, there's a horse\n\n43:23.920 --> 43:27.960\nfor anything, I grew up around horses, I've been riding horses since I was a little girl,\n\n43:27.960 --> 43:34.960\nand these trained horses, they don't want to ride an alignment, I'm gonna go outside\n\n43:34.960 --> 43:39.720\nthe line and she fucked up and spooked the horses, like, did she fly too close to the\n\n43:39.720 --> 43:41.520\nsun, or was she just a complete lunatic?\n\n43:41.520 --> 43:45.840\nWell, I don't know the answers to all those questions, but I just want to say in response\n\n43:45.840 --> 43:53.200\nto that, if she was any of that, if it did come from a place of her being a horse expert,\n\n43:53.200 --> 43:57.840\nor anything like that, she's also a sociopath, just from her...\n\n43:57.840 --> 44:05.120\nNo chimpanzee walks into a group of chimpanzees where they're outnumbered, and goes like,\n\n44:05.120 --> 44:16.960\nget chimp here, out of my way, not sorry I'm late, sorry you're early, any mistakes will\n\n44:16.960 --> 44:19.960\nbe on me, no one would bother to write that insurance check.\n\n44:19.960 --> 44:23.760\nAnd no concern for the woman that had fallen, was she okay?\n\n44:23.760 --> 44:27.760\nShe was okay, but no, that woman showed no concern for me.\n\n44:27.760 --> 44:32.320\nShe didn't connect those dots, she didn't go, cause you know, it can't help but feel\n\n44:32.320 --> 44:38.880\nlike it's a little bit on me, like the story would still, she'd still be a shitty person,\n\n44:38.880 --> 44:44.400\neven if at the end she was kind of like, I kind of feel like maybe I should have just\n\n44:44.400 --> 44:45.400\ncome on time.\n\n44:45.400 --> 44:49.840\nLike it'd still be like, yeah, fuck you, but she didn't even do that, she's like, you\n\n44:49.840 --> 44:55.600\nknow, if this class is going to take any longer and involve less full speed horse riding,\n\n44:55.600 --> 44:57.680\nI want my money back.\n\n44:57.680 --> 45:00.200\nSo the ride was over, canceled?\n\n45:00.200 --> 45:06.840\nThe riding was over, everybody left, except for me and a couple other women that wanted\n\n45:06.840 --> 45:13.000\nto hang out with the goats and the, and there's like a little goat, I think you buried the\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:14.160\nlead on this story.\n\n45:14.160 --> 45:20.320\nThere are these goats in this llama that I had become kind of close to, so I was, what's\n\n45:20.320 --> 45:26.840\nthis camp called, it is a unique camp, what if it was just a dream I had.\n\n45:26.840 --> 45:31.120\nSo I have a quick beef that I didn't talk to you about.\n\n45:31.120 --> 45:35.560\nBut really quick, the reaction afterwards, like it was obvious what had happened, but\n\n45:35.560 --> 45:40.640\nthe way that everyone, everyone said to each other, like almost in a way to deal with the\n\n45:40.640 --> 45:44.200\ntrauma, like, oh, well I heard horses just do that sometimes, like they just like, there's\n\n45:44.200 --> 45:48.520\nno predicting what happened, like maybe a bee like flew in the horse's nose or, but it was\n\n45:48.520 --> 45:53.680\nso clear what had happened, and I kept on like, like looking around at people's eyes,\n\n45:53.680 --> 45:58.520\nand like, is anyone else going to talk about this, but no, no one else, even the woman\n\n45:58.520 --> 46:06.280\nthat was injured, like, didn't, like, I think she, she knew, I don't know, well the woman\n\n46:06.280 --> 46:10.240\nwho, the woman who fell off, she was bruised up, and she was very sweet, but she was very\n\n46:10.240 --> 46:15.440\nexcited that she was the one who got thrown off the horse, so, yeah, I mean, she's, you\n\n46:15.440 --> 46:20.880\nknow, some people are happier when they're the injured one, and she was there, her business\n\n46:20.880 --> 46:28.200\nwas thrownoffahorse.com, the blog, it's like, she's, well no, that's not, that's not fair,\n\n46:28.200 --> 46:32.040\nI want to, I want to, I want to retract, I want to retract that, she was, she was, she\n\n46:32.040 --> 46:37.120\nwas very sweet, and then the woman that was the, you're calling her sociopath, she deals\n\n46:37.120 --> 46:44.280\nwith luxury eyewear, and she looks, I didn't even say that as a thing, but all right, so\n\n46:44.280 --> 46:49.440\nsorry, what was your beef? Oh, well, I saw Tom Kaufman at the Rick and Morty's writer's\n\n46:49.440 --> 47:00.440\nroom, because he's a writer there, yes, yes, yes, he looked on Instagram, there were people,\n\n47:00.440 --> 47:06.880\nsomebody took a photo at Unique Camp, so that's my beef, somebody had their phone, because\n\n47:06.880 --> 47:11.360\nUnique Camp and that whole scene, they're very good with all their social media stuff,\n\n47:11.360 --> 47:15.280\nthere were 10 or 20 photographers the entire time, but like all the pictures from camp\n\n47:15.280 --> 47:21.120\nare already up, and like they were, the people that were in charge of the camp were Instagramming.\n\n47:21.120 --> 47:31.760\nYeah, I don't know, a society where you can't Instagram, but the government can, makes me\n\n47:31.760 --> 47:37.720\nnervous. Aaron, you said you changed your, your, your description of yourself, what did\n\n47:37.720 --> 47:42.840\nit evolve to later on? I already said. Oh, you did? Yeah. Okay, I thought there's more\n\n47:42.840 --> 47:49.840\nevolution to that. At the end I was like, mmm, scuba. I invented the space shuttle. Scuba\n\n47:49.840 --> 47:55.640\nsurgery. Now, did you come away from a, other than a good horse story, did you come away\n\n47:55.640 --> 48:00.040\nwith any, any insights or any knowledge, like any good things you can apply to your life?\n\n48:00.040 --> 48:08.400\nYeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah. Prove it. Prove it. I will, you'll see in the next\n\n48:08.400 --> 48:12.240\nfive years. No, I mean, the thing I took away was just, just integrating all of my skills\n\n48:12.240 --> 48:16.680\ninto like one finite thing. And I was talking to Dan about a project I'm very excited about.\n\n48:16.680 --> 48:23.000\nI'll tell you about it too. Oh, thank you for applauding a, it's, it's killing juice.\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:31.480\nShe got, she got, I just said it's killing juice because people were applauding a project\n\n48:31.480 --> 48:35.440\nwithout knowing what it was. And Hitler was mentioned earlier. I thought you said it's\n\n48:35.440 --> 48:42.440\ncanned juice. Okay, now that we're all at full disclosure, I thought she said, cunt juice.\n\n48:42.440 --> 48:52.440\nI love that the real thing is, can we combine all three of those things? Look, I know I\n\n48:52.440 --> 48:56.440\nhave something going on, really great going on here. And I've got to show it. I've been\n\n48:56.440 --> 49:05.440\ncunt juice. No, it's not. It's a very, it's a very obvious, obvious thing. Yeah. Doesn't\n\n49:05.440 --> 49:11.040\nit suck that you that, that, that every, every joke is this kite that we fly now and it has\n\n49:11.040 --> 49:15.760\nto have this tail on it to keep it from crashing into. Oh God. Well, in full disclosure, because\n\n49:15.760 --> 49:21.840\nof what I just said, I did not hear the word kite. You heard kike because you hate the\n\n49:21.840 --> 49:29.440\nJews. Did she just say that? Wasn't that the dot you were connecting? Yeah. Yeah. I'm\n\n49:29.440 --> 49:34.160\nsorry. I'm going to step behind. Anyways, but, but fuck that. Who cares? The only worst\n\n49:34.160 --> 49:37.960\nthing is fucking talking about it. Let's just, let's just neo-fascist movement fucking\n\n49:37.960 --> 49:43.680\nheat itself. And I will be silently watching in the corner with a big bag of popcorn because\n\n49:43.680 --> 49:50.640\nI can make jokes about kittens, man. Sorry. Let's hear one. No, the, the, when you told\n\n49:50.640 --> 49:56.200\nme that horse story, it made me flash back to when you told me once when you were a kid,\n\n49:56.200 --> 50:00.240\nyou were like this machoist kid. And one of the things you did when you were like, how\n\n50:00.240 --> 50:04.800\nold were you? And you, and you did the exact same thing that this woman did of the story\n\n50:04.800 --> 50:09.840\nexcept you were a kid there. You went to like this horse riding thing and you, but you,\n\n50:09.840 --> 50:14.000\nyou were just like this sweet little girl and told them like, I ride horses all the\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:21.120\ntime. Total lie. Yeah. My family lived overseas and we were, we were exploring around England\n\n50:21.120 --> 50:24.520\nand I went to this thing and I told them that I had a bunch of horse riding experience.\n\n50:24.520 --> 50:27.720\nBecause you wanted the fastest horse or you thought you were going to get a shitty horse\n\n50:27.720 --> 50:32.200\nif you told them you weren't. I feel like other people can relate to this. Maybe not\n\n50:32.200 --> 50:36.440\njust exclusively women, but like it feels like with horses, like, oh, I know. You know\n\n50:36.440 --> 50:39.880\nwhat I mean? Like it doesn't seem like if you haven't ridden a horse that feels like,\n\n50:39.880 --> 50:46.880\nwell, we'll just get each other. And then you just got on the horse. Sounds like a\n\n50:46.880 --> 50:54.880\nfairly brother's movie. You got on the horse and just fucking yeah. Yeah. Everybody, everybody\n\n50:54.880 --> 51:00.040\nwas in a line, but I had talked about how great I was at riding horses and this, this,\n\n51:00.040 --> 51:04.000\nthis nice teacher like wanted to empower me, I guess. And everybody was strapped in a,\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:08.800\nwith like rope to rope to rope. And I, I had never ridden a horse and I was like, this\n\n51:08.800 --> 51:15.400\nis my chance. And I did like, but I had seen in the movies and we took off down the, down\n\n51:15.400 --> 51:19.520\nthe mountainside and the instructor had to go after me because I, I immediately was\n\n51:19.520 --> 51:25.560\nlike, I clearly like had never, you know, when you see it in the movies, it just, I\n\n51:25.560 --> 51:28.720\nmean, National Velvet was my favorite movie as a kid. And I just figured, oh, I'll just\n\n51:28.720 --> 51:34.080\nbear down and I'll be fine.\n\n51:34.080 --> 51:39.480\nI love that all your childhood stories are stories about you just like leaping and then\n\n51:39.480 --> 51:45.440\nmaybe glancing where you've left. You just kind of like, I'm going to, I'm going to\n\n51:45.440 --> 51:52.640\ndo this. And then you're like, uh, Aaron was blondie you, she was the shadow you cast.\n\n51:52.640 --> 52:00.560\nNo, I do like her confidence was pretty amazing. I think she was very, she was very petite\n\n52:00.560 --> 52:05.080\nand looked very young for her age. And I wonder if maybe like, because people usually see\n\n52:05.080 --> 52:10.840\nher as like a young one to send to her, like she, she, she needs to approach situations\n\n52:10.840 --> 52:13.440\nthat way. She's probably gotten way more, especially\n\n52:13.440 --> 52:17.920\nas someone who lives in America and makes, uh, what did you call it? Fashion? I wear\n\n52:17.920 --> 52:24.320\nlike, like, like, like, like somebody whose job does not, does not usually involve like,\n\n52:24.320 --> 52:29.640\nuh, like, like hand to hand combat. I don't know what, I mean, I bet she's gotten way\n\n52:29.640 --> 52:34.680\nmore, way more positive results, but the ratio of positive results to negative results for\n\n52:34.680 --> 52:39.480\nfalse kind of forced assertiveness is like higher.\n\n52:39.480 --> 52:44.080\nIt seemed like bad behavior from someone who's not necessarily a bad person because I interacted\n\n52:44.080 --> 52:47.800\nwith her later and she was, she was just totally cool. It was just like, just, I don't know,\n\n52:47.800 --> 52:48.800\njust really shitty.\n\n52:48.800 --> 52:53.480\nBut it is like a parable because it's like, it's like, it doesn't, I mean, you, the people\n\n52:53.480 --> 52:59.040\nthat get fucked over, I mean, I guess it happens on the freeway every day. It's like, I don't\n\n52:59.040 --> 53:02.760\nknow. It's just like, you see that like weird look on people's faces when they do shitty\n\n53:02.760 --> 53:06.920\nthings in traffic and they're kind of like, you just, you project all this information\n\n53:06.920 --> 53:07.920\non to them.\n\n53:07.920 --> 53:19.360\nOh my God, Kevin was saying the same thing about galaxies, but, but, but like the biggest\n\n53:19.360 --> 53:22.840\nnightmare of all is that when the person's like not even mad, you kind of want people\n\n53:22.840 --> 53:27.520\nto be malicious more than you want. What so often seems to be the reality, which is that\n\n53:27.520 --> 53:33.080\nthey just, they're just like, they just, they're not thinking about other people. They're just\n\n53:33.080 --> 53:38.400\nlike these mannequins that are like driving a car and they just like, I have something\n\n53:38.400 --> 53:43.760\nto do and they'd be so shocked if you, then other people who are like having a bad day,\n\n53:43.760 --> 53:47.680\nlike they, they intersect with this behavior and then they're fucking now they're that\n\n53:47.680 --> 53:53.480\nperson's mad and they go like, like, what the fuck are you doing? I'm all, I'm like,\n\n53:53.480 --> 53:58.360\nwhat the fuck? Like, like you just pulled out and like I saw you, you're the look on\n\n53:58.360 --> 54:02.640\nyour face. You're like a fucking turtle behind a wheel. Like you just, you're just looking\n\n54:02.640 --> 54:07.920\nfor a fly and but you're in a world full of people with three tonne automobiles. There\n\n54:07.920 --> 54:16.320\nare pregnant people, babies, giraffes everywhere. I went too far, but, but, but, and then, but\n\n54:16.320 --> 54:20.920\nthen those people, like if you've ever actually like gotten mad enough to honk and then make\n\n54:20.920 --> 54:26.040\neye contact with them and flip them off, like kind of like kind of vent your outrage at\n\n54:26.040 --> 54:31.240\ntheir carelessness. They, more often than not, they're like, they have this look on their\n\n54:31.240 --> 54:42.240\nface that's like, like, say moi. They're just kind of like, like, oh, me, my, my day today.\n\n54:42.240 --> 54:46.840\nSomeone gets mad at me. What did I do? Well, or they, or there was a mistake. It's always\n\n54:46.840 --> 54:53.080\na mistake. They didn't mean to, no, I mean, except for maybe like a weird, you know, character.\n\n54:53.080 --> 54:56.320\nNobody's like going out there. I'm going to, I'm going to go ram into people or almost\n\n54:56.320 --> 55:01.840\ncause car accidents, but, but they also like, they don't, they don't, they don't, they're\n\n55:01.840 --> 55:07.160\nnot angry at people, whatever. What I'm saying is I think that's more terrifying because\n\n55:07.160 --> 55:12.600\nwhy weren't you, why, why, why weren't you thinking about other people? Why, why, why,\n\n55:12.600 --> 55:18.640\nwhy, what you're, you're, this is, I mean, I can understand not seeing like, uh, that\n\n55:18.640 --> 55:22.760\nthe light turned green or something. I don't know. You get lost in thought and people behind\n\n55:22.760 --> 55:26.800\nyou honk and that's irritating. We've all been there. We've all been behind that person.\n\n55:26.800 --> 55:29.880\nWe've all been that person. I bought a student driver magnet.\n\n55:29.880 --> 55:33.960\nBut I'm talking about not, not, not, not, not, not looking, not driving. I've officially\n\n55:33.960 --> 55:37.960\nbecome middle aged. I'm listening to my podcast. I will bitch about young people driving.\n\n55:37.960 --> 55:42.600\nCan I add a correction? I listened to the, to the last week's episode, which is, which\n\n55:42.600 --> 55:47.560\nis really fun. In the episode, you were talking about baby names and Dan, and you asked Dan\n\n55:47.560 --> 55:56.560\nwhat baby names I wanted. Dan named two names that he suggested that I hate. Connor and,\n\n55:56.560 --> 56:01.000\nuh, Cormac. Cormac. Those are two names that Dan literally was like, what about Cormac?\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:04.840\nWhat about Connor? I was like, I don't remember that. I'm very sorry.\n\n56:04.840 --> 56:12.760\nBut you like Paloma. I do like Paloma. Yeah. Maxwell. Maxwell? Nope.\n\n56:12.760 --> 56:17.840\nIs your name Maxwell? No, it was from the podcast. Oh, from your former D&D character.\n\n56:17.840 --> 56:24.600\nOh yeah. Yeah. I do, I do like, I do like the name. My D&D character, Maxwell Artfall.\n\n56:24.600 --> 56:31.000\nOr yeah, or was that my shadow run character? I don't remember.\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:40.120\nWhat was Night Moves? Night Blade. Night Moves.\n\n56:40.120 --> 56:46.360\nThat's what Dan said to the ladies. Oh, uh, one more thing, and then we'll bring Spencer\n\n56:46.360 --> 56:52.560\nup. You, you were telling me a story from camp, and then you started crying when you\n\n56:52.560 --> 56:57.920\nwere telling the story and telling the story. And I was telling a story at the Memorial Day\n\n56:57.920 --> 57:03.400\nBarbecue where I couldn't, I could not, and I don't think it was that drunk. I'm sure\n\n57:03.400 --> 57:07.480\nit was, I'm sure there's some chemical involved. I'm sure I had enough liquor in me that maybe\n\n57:07.480 --> 57:13.240\nif I was dead sober, this wouldn't happen. But I could not tell this story without crying.\n\n57:13.240 --> 57:20.000\nI was trying, I was talking to two guys, Chris McKenna and Tom Kaufman, I think. I was like\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:25.520\nvery incentivized to not fucking be crying while I was telling this dumb story. And I\n\n57:25.520 --> 57:29.960\ncouldn't get through the story. And then that was happening to you at dinner tonight. Or\n\n57:29.960 --> 57:32.520\nactually, well, it was happening because you were telling about how it happened to you\n\n57:32.520 --> 57:39.520\nat camp. What was the story that you, the swings in Montreal?\n\n57:39.520 --> 57:45.040\nIn Montreal, there's this artist that put up these swings in the middle of like a central\n\n57:45.040 --> 57:51.120\narea and they had their lit at the bottom. And when you, when you swing on them, they\n\n57:51.120 --> 57:55.000\nplay music. And when the artist installed this piece, he was just thinking it would be this\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:58.440\nbeautiful thing from far away. You see lights swinging back and forth, kind of like the\n\n57:58.440 --> 58:06.880\nlight post outside of LACMA. But the, I wonder if I'll cry again. I'll just, I'll just, we'll\n\n58:06.880 --> 58:09.840\nsee. That's what I want to, I want to, so, so there, there are all these, there are all\n\n58:09.840 --> 58:17.160\nthese swings and are like 50 different swings. What he didn't anticipate was that people\n\n58:17.160 --> 58:24.000\nwith swing, people on the swings like started interacting with strangers and, and started\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:28.960\nworking together to like make music on the swings because they all made different, they\n\n58:28.960 --> 58:32.480\nall make different songs. So they would say like, no, you go this way, you go that way.\n\n58:32.480 --> 58:37.160\nAnd there was a picture of like a man and his daughters and he's like holding the swings\n\n58:37.160 --> 58:41.160\nand they're all moving together. And this woman was explaining this as part of a presentation.\n\n58:41.160 --> 58:45.160\nAnd I was just a weeping and then I cried at dinner. And I guess I'm all out.\n\n58:45.160 --> 58:53.000\nBut yeah. So it was just very like, I was just curious like, are those things like sponges?\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:56.080\nCan you squeeze them? Do you have like three times to tell that story? I was, I did, when\n\n58:56.080 --> 59:00.560\nwe were on the road, that guy told me the story about his, his fiance. And I had found\n\n59:00.560 --> 59:04.480\nthat when I was telling the story, I couldn't, I couldn't do it without crying backstage.\n\n59:04.480 --> 59:09.000\nThat's our, that, that, that night in, on the road, I think I don't remember what city\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:12.760\nwe were in, but I tried it. And again, I was, I think I cried on stage, right? Cause it\n\n59:12.760 --> 59:20.240\nwas like, but, but, and then at the Memorial Day barbecue, I started recounting how we\n\n59:20.240 --> 59:25.760\nwent to NASCAR and cause we were, we got invited there. It was the year I got fired. It was\n\n59:25.760 --> 59:30.600\na right before we got fired. The head of Sony has like a NASCAR enthusiast or they sponsor\n\n59:30.600 --> 59:36.600\na car. Sony sponsors a car maybe. And, and we, we went to this NASCAR thing and Tacoma\n\n59:36.600 --> 59:41.840\nsubway thing. And, and, and this woman that came to meet us, who was like the head of\n\n59:41.840 --> 59:52.200\nSony's assistant, um, she sounded like, uh, like, like, like G, G, G, G, uh, uh, what's\n\n59:52.200 --> 59:57.120\nthat? Gloria Steinem, the, the, the, uh, Jeanette from, uh, the, the Ghostbusters secretary,\n\n59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.800\nAnnie Potts character, like Janine, Janine, which is how I imagine Gloria Steinem.\n\n01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:08.160\nUm, she, she, she, she had that. She was, she was like that archetypically like Jersey\n\n01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:14.000\nand like, and she was like three and a half feet tall. And she, and she had like, I remember\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.920\nI was having horn rim glasses with chains and like, which very, very, uh, uh, a tired\n\n01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:25.160\nin a very urban chic way, but greeted us, uh, at the, at the arena and was like, I was like,\n\n01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:31.800\nyou are going to love NASCAR. It's a delight. Um, the, the, the drive is so amazing. It's\n\n01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.520\na great experience. People just love it. And it was like, it was such a weird, it was not\n\n01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.440\na NASCAR personality, but, and we, we, Aaron and I kept like,\n\n01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.960\nShe was very like intellectual too. Like she was very smart and thoughtful.\n\n01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.280\nWe kept falling back and going like, is she forced to do this? Cause she shouldn't be\n\n01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.280\nforced to do this.\n\n01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:53.280\nCause if you haven't been a NASCAR, it's all, it's all very white. It's all very Christian.\n\n01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.360\nLike God is a big part of all of it. Like there's constant praying and it doesn't seem\n\n01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.560\nlike a place where, where, where, where it's just like a nice Jewish woman would want to\n\n01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.560\nhang out.\n\n01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.560\nThat's your backstory. She's very nice. She shows us where the sandwiches are. She introduces\n\n01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:12.240\nthis to the driver of the car. Yeah. Everything is very heartland, uh, you know, wasp, wasp\n\n01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.760\nin California here.\n\n01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.760\nUh, yeah.\n\n01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.000\nSo the Pomona Speedway probably, right? Yeah, yeah. The final Fontana, right?\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nFontana. Yeah.\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nUm, so, so, so at a certain point we've got, I go, uh, I'm going to broach it. I'm going\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.400\nto go. So whatever her name was, um, how does, and in that space, she goes, how does a New\n\n01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.640\nJersey Jewish girl end up being a blah, blah, blah?\n\n01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:38.280\nLike she, she, she like summed up, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And so it took, took\n\n01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.760\nthe whole burden of it off of her. We're like, we're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.000\nHow, what, what is this action figure doing in this play set?\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.960\nUm, and, and, and, and she goes, well, you know, and she starts to read, she, she recounts\n\n01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.920\nthe story. It has a real answer. And the answer is that when she was a kid, her dad, cry,\n\n01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.080\ncry, cry, cry.\n\n01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:08.040\nHer dad was really into cars and she would sit with him and, uh, fix cars with him. And\n\n01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:12.720\nthen he died. And then she, she explained that it was fucking amazing. Uh, and I can't,\n\n01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.920\nI can't say it without crying because it's, I don't know, it's just stories like there\n\n01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.520\naren't sponges that you can, that, that you can wring out. Like you can say three times\n\n01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.160\nwhen all the tears are gone. There's certain stories that you met. You might get better\n\n01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.920\nat telling and eliminate the parts that are potent.\n\n01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:30.040\nYeah. Like I could maybe steer around that with my jet ski, like set way points, grand\n\n01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:36.120\ntheft auto way points that, that I know will avoid combat with my emotions. But it's, it's,\n\n01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.920\nit's weirder to me that there's like a point in there where it's an uncontrollable emotional\n\n01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.160\nresponse to something that's, it's not random because there's an emotional component to\n\n01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.560\nthat story. A father died and all this stuff, but something is happening to me because Aaron\n\n01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.560\nsaid, someone said, told me, you could, you're telling the story. You couldn't stop crying.\n\n01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.480\nAnd you can try. I thought we, I thought we agreed that story was funny. Like it was\n\n01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.920\njust kind of a funny thing. Oh no, sorry. No, no, no, we both agreed it was touching,\n\n01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.240\nbut I'm saying that you, you were surprised because it wasn't like we were balling that\n\n01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.320\nday. Yeah. At the time it was like kind of a, not, not, not laughing at her in any way,\n\n01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:15.320\nbut it laughing at a like, oh, this is such a, such a seemingly like really touching, like\n\n01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:20.520\nobvious, like on the nose, like create like story. For me, like father and son, mother\n\n01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.080\ndaughter stories and movies, like those always get me like, like Frozen's a good movie. It's\n\n01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:29.560\nnot a great Disney movie. Like I'm a sucker for Disney films. Like I, it's not, it's not\n\n01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.400\ngreat, but, but like still like this song is when there's moments in it where like sisters\n\n01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.240\nor like family stuff, I'll just start crying. I'm a, I'm a pushover for that kind of shit.\n\n01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.040\nYou got to let it go, Jeff. Let it go. Let it go.\n\n01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:48.840\nI'm scared to watch. Young male friendships get me sandlot and stand by me like little,\n\n01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.920\nlittle boys that are friends. Like I just got a, I just want to watch those. Just want\n\n01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:58.520\nto watch them. I'm going to get you, I'm going to get you a white van for Christmas.\n\n01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:04.240\nI want you to live here. Can you get me a big, a baseball mitt decal for the side with\n\n01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.720\nfree beneath it? I don't know. I want to attract the right kind of boys.\n\n01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.560\nThe ones that like baseball. There's, there are certain scenes and certain movies that\n\n01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.280\nare absolutely meaningless to other people. If I describe a certain scene, I will start\n\n01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.720\ncrying and I've done it a million times. I cannot, like there's certain things that\n\n01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.960\naffect you and I'm, well, I'm a crier. We, I think we've discussed this.\n\n01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.880\nI mean, you could cry. You could fake crying cute. People couldn't tell a difference. So\n\n01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.120\nI can't fake crying cute. I can't just like, I produce a tear without like actually like\n\n01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.800\ngoing through something, but I can cry on camera.\n\n01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800\nRight.\n\n01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:42.160\nIt's a, it's, it's embarrassing because one time I did a pilot, I did a pilot. Oh dear.\n\n01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.760\nI did a pilot and it was two doctors and I cried on scene and the director walked up\n\n01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:51.760\nto me and said, okay, Jeff, that's a little bit much. All right. I didn't have to cry\n\n01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.760\nin that scene. Did I? It didn't say any cries. I just started crying into seeing that.\n\n01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:03.760\nThat little boy doesn't retrain his brain. He'll be dyslexic until sixth grade.\n\n01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:11.000\nNo. It was like, what time is it again? It was like, it was, it was meeting the scene.\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.800\nI just thought I'd really get an Emmy in that pilot that never aired.\n\n01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.560\nWhen I was in the, when I was in the fifth grade, I was in a Christmas play and at a\n\n01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.680\ncertain point the chorus came out with these big plastic lollipops and we're supposed\n\n01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:26.920\nto be dancing with the lollipops. And in rehearsal, the director had said like, like, pretend\n\n01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.920\nlike you really want to lick the lollipop. And I misunderstood. So in the play, when,\n\n01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:35.440\nwhen everyone came out and everyone's dancing with the lollipops and going like for the\n\n01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:41.120\npodcast listeners, just like gently like a way air licking the lollipop. I was licking\n\n01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.720\nit and like pretending to eat the lollipop. And I was, I forgot to dance was just standing\n\n01:05:45.720 --> 01:06:01.240\nthere. And to get notes after a one-time production, yeah, they're just worried you're going out\n\n01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.480\ninto the world. They're not even worried about next week's show.\n\n01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:12.200\nThe show is closed. Here's the personality notes. The world is full of scissors. So we\n\n01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:17.880\nneed to talk to you about your behavior on stage tonight. Yeah, I can't, I can't, I\n\n01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:24.960\ncan't watch that. Michael Keaton's my life. I can do when the dad starts shaving them.\n\n01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:31.400\nLook it up. When the dad starts shaving them. Michael Keaton in my life plays a terminally\n\n01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:37.840\nill man who is, who's Nicole Kipman is pregnant and he's, so he's making, he's taping his\n\n01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:43.960\nlife or he's taping, he's taping, he's making tapes that his kid can watch. This doesn't\n\n01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:48.760\naffect me at all. I can roll my eyes describing this. Michael Keaton's making tapes because\n\n01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:54.600\nhe's going to die so that his kid can watch Michael Keaton after he's dead. You know,\n\n01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:02.040\nI mean, don't flatter yourself, dad, but, but, but, but Michael Keaton's dad is like\n\n01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:07.560\nthat. I don't know. It's something, something pheromonal must come off the screen or something\n\n01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:12.520\nis relationship with his dad. It's just, it's just a lack of a relationship. And then he's\n\n01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:16.080\nnot even telling his family he has cancer for a while. And then there's a point where\n\n01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:20.180\nMichael Keaton's too sick to get out of bed and his dad is shaving him with a straight\n\n01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:30.320\nrazor. It's fucked up. It's, his dad shaves him. Oh, it was fucked up. I also once cried\n\n01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:35.080\nat the end of Doc Hollywood. So you go, you figured out that was just drunk. That was\n\n01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:41.600\njust fucking drunk. I went, I went, I went on a date with a girl. What year did pretty\n\n01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:48.200\nwoman come out? Anybody? 90. 90. I went on a date with this girl to pretty women and\n\n01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:58.280\nI cried, cried, cried. She cried too. But like, I was like, I was crying harder.\n\n01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:07.760\nBecause you feel like a little hooker. You want, you, you want to, I haven't seen the\n\n01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:14.520\nmovies. I had a no kissing role, but I found out that you have to break that rule sometimes.\n\n01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:23.440\nI haven't seen it. Oh, Billy Elliot. I saw that with a friend. Like, it wasn't the girl\n\n01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.960\nI was dating. Like a friend of mine. And we went to the Los Feliz 3, a little tiny theater\n\n01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.840\nand we saw it and I was sitting there and I'm watching it. And it's about a, you know,\n\n01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:37.360\nit's about a little kid who wants to, wants to dance and his family's poor, like working\n\n01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:43.600\nclass English family. And the family's, the mother dies. Father sacrifices everything\n\n01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.080\nto get this kid through dance school. And at the end he comes on stage and he just swan\n\n01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:52.320\nlike and it's like, when he jumps in the air, when he jumps in the spoilers, everybody,\n\n01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.760\nif you haven't seen Billy Elliot, 30 years ago, he comes out, he's an adult. What they\n\n01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:01.440\ndon't do in that movie is make a big thing about him possibly being gay. They don't make\n\n01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:05.680\na big thing about, well, you're gay, son. They don't do that. Like, you want to dance\n\n01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.560\nand I'm a coal miner and like, or whatever he's, whatever he's mining, I can't afford\n\n01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.760\nyour lifestyle. I can't, I can't send you to classes. I can't do that. So they do that.\n\n01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.480\nAnd that's, that's father's sonship. That's amazing. And then at the end, when he, when\n\n01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:21.760\nnow he's an adult and they cut to all of a sudden, he's this huge fit, sexy, older or\n\n01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:28.320\nnot older. He was probably 18, 19. And he's like the, the, the swan and swan like, and\n\n01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.640\nhe comes out and does his leap. And I may cry when I say this, I've told it too many\n\n01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:38.520\ntimes. And, and, and they cut to the father and he sees his son leap in the air and he's\n\n01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:43.280\nlike overwhelmed by it. And that to me, I cried so fucking hard in that theater. We\n\n01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.240\ngot in the car, I lived at the time, like six blocks away from that theater. I had to\n\n01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.160\npull over because I was driving and I couldn't see.\n\n01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.640\nYou're watching in your car?\n\n01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:57.760\nNo. I cried in the theater and I was, I was embarrassed. I mean, I was not, I wasn't embarrassed\n\n01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.240\nabout crying. I was not embarrassed, but I was, I was afraid of affecting other people's\n\n01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.560\nmovie going experience because I was being so, I was like sobbing. And so I was trying\n\n01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:12.720\nto muffle my, I was really, I broke down. And then we made it to the car and I got my\n\n01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.120\nshit together. Or no, we were the last people to leave the theater and we got in the car\n\n01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.560\nand I drove home and had to pull over because I couldn't see the road because crying so\n\n01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.480\nhard. And I had to stop three blocks away and I was still just completely overcome by\n\n01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.480\nthat.\n\n01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.480\nGeez. Yeah.\n\n01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.880\nGet a life, this guy.\n\n01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880\nYou know what? Fuck that.\n\n01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.720\nYeah. It's no, it's no doc Hollywood.\n\n01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:40.440\nI got all fucked up by the Lego movie. Did you see me? Did you know I was crying next\n\n01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.440\nto you?\n\n01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.840\nI did not know you were crying.\n\n01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:43.840\nAnd usually I'm always watching.\n\n01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.080\nThat was a tough, that was a hard one because it was right on the fucking bubble of what's\n\n01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:53.400\nallowed to make you cry versus what's like just forcing it and like hoping you cry, which\n\n01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.640\nI don't want to give a fuck. It's like a Lego movie. It's literally about corporate\n\n01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:04.000\nplastic. And I was like, I know you want me to cry. It's a fine written movie. You did\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000\na good job.\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.840\nBut it's not crying for me.\n\n01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.040\nMusical crescendos when a simple story beat happens and the music swells and fucking on\n\n01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040\ngame over, baby.\n\n01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040\nHow about me?\n\n01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:20.120\nI think it had a lot to do with Will Ferrell. I think he's a really like, like, like stranger\n\n01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:24.800\nthan fiction. Like he's, if he wants to, he can, I think that's why he's so funny. I think\n\n01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.520\nhe's a really facile.\n\n01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.680\nDid you, did you cry during Meet the Robinson? Anyone underrated movie? Anyone like Meet\n\n01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680\nthe Robinson?\n\n01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.680\nI never saw.\n\n01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.680\nWait, what was Meet the Robinson?\n\n01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.680\nYeah, that's good.\n\n01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.680\nFox and the Hound.\n\n01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680\nNo, those guys are good.\n\n01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.680\nFox and the Hound is my ultimate.\n\n01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.680\nThat's good.\n\n01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.680\nAnd there are two, there's still little boys, but they're animals.\n\n01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.680\nWait, what's Meet the Robinson? What is that?\n\n01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.680\nI don't know. What's Meet the Robinson? There's somebody meet, there's somebody meet the.\n\n01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.680\nMeet the Robinson is about the young orphan who's an inventor. And he finds a family.\n\n01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.680\nI haven't seen that.\n\n01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:04.440\nI was watching the original Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn, and it starts off and I, who is it?\n\n01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.680\nIs it William Holden and Boca? Who's in it?\n\n01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.680\nNobody knows her.\n\n01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:15.120\nBut it started off like this rich people parting and they pan outside the party and they go\n\n01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:20.480\nup this tree and there's this, the chauffeur's daughter from this rich family, this rich New\n\n01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:26.920\nYork family, she's just in the tree watching these sexy rich people party and they go up\n\n01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.440\nthe tree and they just cut to Audrey Hepburn's face and I was watching it at home alone.\n\n01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.800\nAnd I just hit pause and broke down crying.\n\n01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:40.760\nReally? It's such a beautiful story about Audrey Hepburn is too beautiful in that movie.\n\n01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:47.800\nLike I think that you lose the impact of that story so lost on her beautiful little star\n\n01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:48.800\nface.\n\n01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.600\nI don't know if it's at home or the plot or anything. I'm just saying that when they\n\n01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.280\ncut up there and you see her looking at that and it was that moment like so well directed\n\n01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.400\nof somebody like what being on the outside of something and you cut to her eyes and she's\n\n01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:03.840\nso beautiful and she's like so like unique, it's one of those moments where I had to hit\n\n01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.680\npause and just like come, I just came apart.\n\n01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.520\nBut I do that a lot so that's not what I'm saying a whole lot.\n\n01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:12.080\nAre you saying you were just crying at her beauty?\n\n01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.040\nNo, no, no, no, not her physical beauty. There was just that moment.\n\n01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.480\nHow are you not weeping right now?\n\n01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.440\nThere's moments like Catherine Hepburn, what's the fucking movie? Holiday or some shit?\n\n01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.440\nHoliday?\n\n01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:28.160\nNo, not Roman Holiday. There's one, it's her and what's the one with Kerry Grant? Is it\n\n01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.160\nKerry Grant?\n\n01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:30.160\nFuck, now I can't think of who it is.\n\n01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.160\nIt's called Bright Middles.\n\n01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:38.320\nHe's kind of like a socialist anarchist. He should marry the rich he wants to go away\n\n01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.560\nand be like do his own thing and not become a capitalist.\n\n01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:57.440\nCatherine Hepburn, she's like the not sexy sister, although Catherine Hepburn is gorgeous\n\n01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.680\nand she wants the guy and the guy leaves and the door opens and she sees him and she turns\n\n01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.200\nto the camera and Catherine Hepburn has the ability to always look like she's about to\n\n01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.560\nlike cry or say something amazing and she just turns to camera. It's one of those moments\n\n01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:15.520\nwhere like somebody like tweet me or put it on some sort of forum, tell me all the details\n\n01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.160\nabout that. There's a moment where cinema, like the director, the actors, the script\n\n01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.960\nall comes together and somebody just turning the camera and the way it's lit and the way\n\n01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:29.080\nit's shot, they can just hit you like a fucking lightning bolt and like that's my favorite\n\n01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.080\nstuff in the world.\n\n01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.920\nThat's what happened in Doc Hollywood. You gotta watch it.\n\n01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.480\nYou know who I always call Doc Hollywood?\n\n01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.640\nGlory gets me too.\n\n01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:49.400\nGlory had a shelf life for getting me. I think Glory got me in high school and then I started\n\n01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.440\nto go like fuck these poor people are all just dying for rich people. I don't know\n\n01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:58.560\nwhat, I'm just angry watching it. But Monuments Men, I started crying because Hitler lost\n\n01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:05.960\nall his paintings. I've been wanting to say that for 15 minutes. I thought that was that\n\n01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:13.000\nfunny. But I'm also distracted. Is this a friend of yours, this young lady? Did she\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.760\nleave because the show was terrible or did she?\n\n01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.320\nI'm so much more focused.\n\n01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.160\nI feel bad about where she's sitting.\n\n01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.480\nI don't think it's because your feet were in her face.\n\n01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:30.160\nI'm sitting at a certain angle and I want to keep the volume at the same place so the\n\n01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:33.400\nperson I'm talking about doesn't know that it's happening. But there's a fellow right\n\n01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:39.280\nnow. Shit, he woke up. This guy over here. Are you okay? What's your name, man? What's\n\n01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.280\nyour name?\n\n01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.560\nWhat's your name? What's your name?\n\n01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.560\nColin.\n\n01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560\nColin, you're right, man.\n\n01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.560\nI'm sleeping.\n\n01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:52.440\nBecause I've been watching you struggle with this the whole show, man. You've been head\n\n01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.200\nin hands. Are you high or are you a little tired? What's going on over here? A little\n\n01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.200\nbit of both?\n\n01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.360\nWell, I just got back from a long trip.\n\n01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:05.880\nColin, I could be wrong, but have you ever fallen asleep at a UCB show? I feel like I've\n\n01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.240\nseen you sleep before.\n\n01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.200\nOh, I thought you were being defensive.\n\n01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:16.680\nNo, no, no. When I saw him, I was like, that guy fell asleep at my show at UCB.\n\n01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:23.400\nBut Colin, you've been over there. You're good, right? Oh, see, that guy just brought\n\n01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.400\nyou a water. That's great.\n\n01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.080\nThat guy is podcast producer, Dustin Marshall.\n\n01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.920\nColin, I'm just glad you're going to make it, man. Where'd you fly in from or where'd\n\n01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920\nyou travel from?\n\n01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.920\nI drove back from Zion.\n\n01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:35.920\nFrom Zion?\n\n01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.920\nOh, okay.\n\n01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:37.920\nWhere's Zion?\n\n01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.920\nIt's in Utah.\n\n01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.920\nOh, Utah.\n\n01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.000\nYou can't know where Zion is. The robots will find it.\n\n01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.200\nSo, it's a little matrix comedy, man.\n\n01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.200\nClassic.\n\n01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:58.360\nThat's what we do here at Harmontown. We sneak into matrix comedy once in a while.\n\n01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:02.960\nAre you good though, man? Okay, good. I thought you might have, you know, some serious shit\n\n01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.960\ngoing down.\n\n01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.960\nHe's just a little sleepy.\n\n01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.960\nHe's just a little sleepy.\n\n01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:06.960\nWhat a nightmare to be in.\n\n01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:07.960\nNobody, nobody, nobody.\n\n01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.960\nHe was stirred from your sleep.\n\n01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.960\nHe wasn't just sleepy. He was ringing his face. He was like rubbing his head.\n\n01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.320\nHe said, I mean, that's what I do when I'm going like, God, please don't fall asleep.\n\n01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:22.000\nI know this show is just three people talking about movies they liked, but it's so much\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.600\nlike being in a car, just going down the highway from Zion.\n\n01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.040\nI don't know what's real anymore.\n\n01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.360\nWhat was going down in Zion, Colin?\n\n01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.000\nOh, I was doing, I was doing some canyoneering.\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nYou do some canyoneering?\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nOkay, the shit got fucking more interesting, doesn't it?\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.560\nWhat does it take to canyoneer? I'm not familiar with the canyoneering lifestyle.\n\n01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:49.280\nGo sit at Spencer's table, Colin. Get on the microphone.\n\n01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.280\nNo, no, come up to me.\n\n01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:54.080\nNo, no, sit down over there so you can fall asleep possibly.\n\n01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:59.440\nColin, are you a canyoneer by trade?\n\n01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.440\nNot by trade, no.\n\n01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.440\nWhat would he sell?\n\n01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:05.440\nI don't know. I don't know what a canyoneer is.\n\n01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:12.440\nHe might sell rope or arrowheads. I don't know what he does.\n\n01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:19.440\nWell, Colin, we need four canyones today. Just make a list.\n\n01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:26.400\nThese arrowheads are going out the door like hotcakes. We need more canyoneering to happen\n\n01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.880\nas the overhead is so tremendous.\n\n01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:34.320\nTell me about, walk me through as an outsider.\n\n01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.120\nSo you know mountaineering, like climbing a mountain.\n\n01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.000\nThis is canyoneering, so you go down.\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nSo you just send into canyones.\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nIs it a joke? Why did you canyoneer? Because it isn't there?\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000\nNo, we canyoneer.\n\n01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nYou know you're saying.\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000\nMountain climbing.\n\n01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:00.000\nNo, you have to climb up. And then you just send down into a canyone.\n\n01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000\nHow do you know when you're finished?\n\n01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.760\nSo if a canyoneering is the opposite, you just send down, then the hard work lay ahead where\n\n01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.840\nyou have to climb the fuck out.\n\n01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.400\nYou don't have to climb out because you get to the bottom.\n\n01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:14.840\nBut isn't your car up there?\n\n01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:19.840\nYou just live down there for the rest of your life?\n\n01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:26.840\nOkay, sometimes you can go from your car, hike up, and then come back down to your car.\n\n01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:30.600\nOr you set up a shuttle, so when you get to the bottom.\n\n01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.600\nCanyoneering a shuttle, Colin.\n\n01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.600\nSomeone will pick you up.\n\n01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:36.080\nWell, sometimes it's a long walk back to your car.\n\n01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.080\nRight.\n\n01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.880\nWhat is your favorite part of canyoneering?\n\n01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:43.840\nClearly not the walk back to your car.\n\n01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.640\nDo you like going down more or going back up?\n\n01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:49.640\nThe repelling.\n\n01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:50.640\nOh, so you have to repell.\n\n01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.920\nSo you're going to share clips and shit.\n\n01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.920\nWe had to wear wetsuits.\n\n01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920\nWhat?\n\n01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:57.920\nYeah.\n\n01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.920\nBecause it's going to get wet.\n\n01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.720\nYeah, we had to swim because we had to swim in these canyons.\n\n01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.720\nJesus.\n\n01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:07.280\nYou're like a Navy SEAL.\n\n01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.760\nOkay, that's it.\n\n01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:19.440\nSo when you're repelling, you're in the movies, like the people, are you driving metal into\n\n01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.440\nrock?\n\n01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.640\nOkay, so that's like rock climbing.\n\n01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.640\nOkay.\n\n01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.640\nThey're going down.\n\n01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.640\nThey're setting anchors in here.\n\n01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.880\nOh, so you can tie something up the top because you're climbing up.\n\n01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.080\nHow do you anchor yourself in at the top?\n\n01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.360\nLike, well, we repelled off some rocks.\n\n01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:41.960\nSo you just tie off on a big rock and hope that Looney Tunes rules don't apply.\n\n01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:47.920\nSometimes you can use a nice big tree, but yeah, I said an anchor that was just a pile\n\n01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:48.920\nof rocks.\n\n01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:54.000\nSo you go down to a canyon, ostensibly your shit is up top, right?\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:01.520\nSo yeah, you park your car at the, you know, the trailhead.\n\n01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:08.280\nYou hike to the drop-in point following some very vague directions.\n\n01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:12.960\nSometimes it's very difficult to find it, you get lost.\n\n01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.680\nAnd then you climb down into the canyon.\n\n01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:19.240\nAnd once you're down there, how do you get, your rope is just tied up there, it just stays\n\n01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.240\nthere?\n\n01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.240\nIt's a way to get it back off.\n\n01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.080\nOr do you do like an Indiana Jones thing with a whip where it just comes off?\n\n01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:30.560\nSo you throw one end of the rope down and then you block it off so it can't go any further.\n\n01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:37.360\nYou rappel down and then you throw, you have to have a rope that's twice as long as a rappel.\n\n01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.360\nSo you can throw the other end down and then when you all get down, you can pull that other\n\n01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.360\nend.\n\n01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.360\nOh.\n\n01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.360\nI would do it wrong.\n\n01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:47.360\nI would do it wrong because I didn't even get that.\n\n01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.400\nSo one of your friends has to not be a canyon area, he has to be up at the car getting your\n\n01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.400\nrope back.\n\n01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.400\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.400\nOh, no, no.\n\n01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.400\nWhen you're done, you get back up there and you fucking pull it back up.\n\n01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.400\nThat's where the car is.\n\n01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.400\nThe car is by the tree.\n\n01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.400\nBasically.\n\n01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:02.000\nSo when you get down to the canyon, do you guys have a little party down there?\n\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.240\nDo you guys set up camp and fucking make marshmallows and shit or?\n\n01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.640\nWell, it depends.\n\n01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:13.200\nSometimes there's the canyons that are long enough to facilitate like a three-day trek\n\n01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.200\nthrough it.\n\n01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:19.800\nWhat's a good canyon and what's a bad canyon?\n\n01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:20.800\nLike when you're like, obviously.\n\n01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:25.800\nHe's not going to talk shit about a canyon, he's a canyon here.\n\n01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:29.600\nHe's making all the arrowhead money.\n\n01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.960\nObviously some trips are better than others.\n\n01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:38.800\nWhat makes like, oh, yeah, that was deep or like that was like.\n\n01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:45.920\nOh, cavernous men, straight up cavernous.\n\n01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.920\nThat was not convex at all.\n\n01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:48.920\nIt definitely depends.\n\n01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.320\nIt depends on what you're there for.\n\n01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:51.320\nSee, I like.\n\n01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.320\nWhat are you there for?\n\n01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:56.720\nThere's challenges of like some down climbing and some of the problem solving that comes\n\n01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.920\nwith setting anchors and.\n\n01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.920\nWhat's bad canyoneering form?\n\n01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.320\nLike, were there any like faux pas?\n\n01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:07.160\nLike you do you do you ever like you be going down a down into a canyon you see someone\n\n01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.400\nelse going down the canyon that guy's doing it wrong.\n\n01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.440\nWell, yeah, there was a there was a story.\n\n01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.440\nThis group.\n\n01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.880\nWell, it wasn't really a group.\n\n01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:15.960\nIt was two people.\n\n01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:20.360\nIt was this gentleman and his priest.\n\n01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:30.040\nThat's already the wrong way to say that seems pessimistic, but but yeah, I got a bad feeling\n\n01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.040\nabout this.\n\n01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.080\nThey father rejoined me.\n\n01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:37.000\nHe wanted to be baptized in this canyon or whatever.\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:44.720\nSo he's for a priest is like, okay, so I don't I don't know what they were thinking, but\n\n01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:54.000\nthey went into the canyon with flip flops, like tank tops, like shorts, and a backpack\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:02.160\nfull of camera supplies, no water, no food, no helmets, and no rope or or descending.\n\n01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.160\nNo rope.\n\n01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.160\nThey somehow.\n\n01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:08.960\nThey were going to butt scoot down the hill.\n\n01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.960\nYeah.\n\n01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:16.800\nThey somehow managed to get down this canyon, and they got stuck on the opposite side of\n\n01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:21.920\nthis pool of freezing water, and they couldn't get across.\n\n01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.680\nWho did who told you that story?\n\n01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:26.280\nThe group I went with actually was in that canyon.\n\n01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:32.040\nThey were doing the canyon with all of their gear and what where his sense was to people.\n\n01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:38.520\nAnd I was just I not to digress too much, but but somebody was telling me that you watch\n\n01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:43.360\nthe show, it's a reality show called like, I should have died or I survived or something\n\n01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.360\nlike that.\n\n01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.360\nYeah, I've heard of it.\n\n01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.360\nI have.\n\n01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.360\nI shouldn't be alive.\n\n01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.360\nI shouldn't be alive.\n\n01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.360\nI heard of it.\n\n01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.360\nI should have died was too negative.\n\n01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.360\nThey workshopped it.\n\n01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.360\nI should have died.\n\n01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.360\nI don't want to live.\n\n01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.360\nThere was a start.\n\n01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:58.960\nSomebody was telling me with the show and they're like, yeah, they're telling me about this\n\n01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.560\ncouple that was like, they should have, they should have died because they kind of went\n\n01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:03.560\noff to the wilderness unprepared.\n\n01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.880\nBut the thing that was amazing to me is that at a certain point in their story, they come\n\n01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:15.080\nacross like when things are really dire already, they come across a corpse, an undiscovered\n\n01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:20.560\ncorpse of a guy that had more equipment than they set out with a fucking chest or copper\n\n01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.560\npot to their goonies.\n\n01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:31.200\nLike they like, it was like a fucking emaciated, skeletal fucking dude by a river that was\n\n01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:35.520\nlike, yep, I found water, not enough.\n\n01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:40.120\nBut the way they survived, this is so fucking sad.\n\n01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120\nAre you going to cry again?\n\n01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.120\nNo.\n\n01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.120\nNo, because it's sad about just reality.\n\n01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:47.200\nIt's a sad joke that God plays on all of us.\n\n01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.120\nThe way they survived is that the guy, this corpse had a lighter in his equipment and\n\n01:25:52.120 --> 01:26:00.280\nthe guy just started setting forest fires until finally they caused enough of a problem\n\n01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:09.280\nin terms of climate, in terms of global economics that vehicles show up.\n\n01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.520\nThe guy got lost.\n\n01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.520\nThey got lost.\n\n01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.520\nI found a corpse.\n\n01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.520\nYeah.\n\n01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.640\nThe corpse had a lighter?\n\n01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.640\nThe corpse had a lighter and it worked.\n\n01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.640\nAnd then he just started lighting forest fires.\n\n01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.640\nYeah.\n\n01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:19.640\nHey, Colin, would you do-\n\n01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.640\nWhat part of that story do you-\n\n01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.640\nHe's just being incredulous.\n\n01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:22.640\nDan, how about this?\n\n01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.640\nLet's bring Spencer up.\n\n01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.640\nColin, would you mind coming up on the stage and playing D&D with me?\n\n01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640\nYeah, yeah, would you?\n\n01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.640\nYou know.\n\n01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.640\nWe have a real-\n\n01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:38.200\nLet's bring Spencer out.\n\n01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:46.360\nYou'll be great at it, I assume, because it's like simulated wilderness.\n\n01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.360\nWhat's happening, you guys?\n\n01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:49.360\nHey.\n\n01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.360\nSpencer.\n\n01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.880\nSorry, I just wanted to get you out here, man.\n\n01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880\nWe met asleep.\n\n01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.880\nHe came in here.\n\n01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880\nOh, I know.\n\n01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:02.560\nI just saw, just real, real quick, large musical movie swells make me cry too, Jim.\n\n01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.560\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:04.560\nMusical swells, baby.\n\n01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.960\nBut yeah, yeah, just getting that out of the way.\n\n01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.480\nI don't think you said this, but I know Colin.\n\n01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.480\nOh.\n\n01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.480\nI'm friends with him.\n\n01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.480\nFor real?\n\n01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.480\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:14.480\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.320\nSee, I was just going to say, I bet you really like Colin because you're fucking- you're\n\n01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.320\na coyote.\n\n01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.560\nI'm being glib, but you're into life hacking and wilderness, kind of.\n\n01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.000\nNot that you're a big camping guy, but-\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nYeah, we definitely trade coyote notes, sure.\n\n01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.880\nSpencer, there was a- sorry, Spencer, there was a coyote- several coyotes up at the camp.\n\n01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:34.880\nYeah.\n\n01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:39.360\nOh, Spencer's been telling me- Spencer drives me to work in the morning.\n\n01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:43.520\nHe's been telling me that since that podcast- I don't know if he connected the dots, but\n\n01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:49.160\nsince that podcast, you've told me that you've been seeing more and more coyotes gathering\n\n01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.680\naround your apartment.\n\n01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.880\nLike, you didn't put it that way, but I was like, I think they heard the podcast.\n\n01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:55.880\nYeah.\n\n01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.040\nThey want to throw down.\n\n01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:02.120\nI wouldn't put that way because it's not factually accurate.\n\n01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:08.520\nLike, when I dropped Dan off at his house, I was driving home and just like, you know,\n\n01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.320\na couple- near his house, I saw a coyote there.\n\n01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.320\nAll right, nearby.\n\n01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.120\nAnd then I see him all the time at Griffith Park because I drive by in the mornings.\n\n01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.280\nOh, yeah, it's not near your place at all.\n\n01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.200\nCoyotes are tra- finding you, though.\n\n01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.200\nThey're finding out and stuff.\n\n01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.960\nCoyotes are marauding through my neighborhood in Los Feliz and my neighbor, Paul Rust,\n\n01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.760\nhis cat got eaten not so long ago.\n\n01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.760\nYeah, it's sad.\n\n01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.760\nI see those signs.\n\n01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:37.440\nAnd he said, when he walks his dog, he goes out, it's 2 a.m., and he'll open the door\n\n01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.440\nand the sound of the leash jingling is the dinner bell for coyotes.\n\n01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.800\nThey know the sound of doors opening and the leashes.\n\n01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:47.720\nAnd so there's a big ass pack and you wake up in my neighborhood to the sound of an animal\n\n01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.840\nbeing absolutely murdered and screaming.\n\n01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.760\nAnd then people coming out and throwing wine bottles and whatever's at hand and throwing\n\n01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.760\nshit at coyotes.\n\n01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.760\nWait, this is your apartment?\n\n01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.760\nYeah.\n\n01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.240\nYou live in a fucking what?\n\n01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:01.240\nLet's go down.\n\n01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:08.040\nCoyotes come down by the dozen, I know that the dozen's, I'll say, 400, we are the 400.\n\n01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.800\nJust 50 yards from us.\n\n01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.800\nYou'll see, yeah, no, no.\n\n01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.840\nYou'll see like one coyote, three more, five more.\n\n01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:17.840\nWhat?\n\n01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.200\nAnd they come down in packs and they go down.\n\n01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.200\nCome down from where?\n\n01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.480\nCome down from Griffith Park.\n\n01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.680\nThey cross those fields of bull bar.\n\n01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.120\nYou can see them sometimes crossing like a little caravan.\n\n01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.920\nAnd they come because of the dinner bell?\n\n01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.320\nThey come down to eat cats and they come down to eat dogs.\n\n01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.760\nAnd my cat goes outside.\n\n01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:40.280\nA dog across the street, the house, maybe like about a month, a month and a half ago.\n\n01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:43.680\nI heard, I mean, I can't do an impression, Aaron, do you have an impression of a dog\n\n01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.680\ngetting eaten?\n\n01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.680\nA dog being eaten.\n\n01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.680\nWhat kind of dog?\n\n01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.680\nA small dog, high-pitched terror.\n\n01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:48.680\nOkay.\n\n01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:49.680\nOh, those are the coyotes.\n\n01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.680\nAll right.\n\n01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.680\nNo.\n\n01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:52.680\nI just came.\n\n01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.680\nI just came.\n\n01:29:53.680 --> 01:30:06.680\nSomeone's jerking off with that right now.\n\n01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.680\nI imagine that about 10 times worse and louder.\n\n01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:16.600\nAnd then people were, I said, imagine it, but like, no, it's fucking, it's a, it's bloody\n\n01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:17.600\nmurder out there.\n\n01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.040\nAnd the coyotes are getting real good at it.\n\n01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.760\nDo you think they could get into my backyard and don't be a doomsayer and be a supportive\n\n01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:24.240\nif enabling friends?\n\n01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.240\nYes.\n\n01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.240\nYes.\n\n01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.880\nI will say that absolutely they can get into your backyard.\n\n01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.880\nBut there's a lot of bushes around it.\n\n01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.080\nOur backyard is surrounded by houses.\n\n01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:38.080\nOur backyard, you know, like not from your front yard, they come in through the back.\n\n01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.880\nThere's, jump down that wall thing.\n\n01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.880\nBut they would jump all that distance?\n\n01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.880\nYeah.\n\n01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.880\nSeven foot wall.\n\n01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:46.120\nThey probably can't get back up easily, but yeah.\n\n01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.120\nWell, that would serve them right.\n\n01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.440\nI'd like to see that coyote.\n\n01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:50.240\nIt'd be worth him eating my cat.\n\n01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.240\nJust to, just to have him trapped in my backyard.\n\n01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:56.240\nDan and I had a racking problem and we kept catching the neighbors.\n\n01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:00.240\nI got a friend you want to meet.\n\n01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:04.640\nNo, I don't think you're, you're backyard surrounded by other houses that are front\n\n01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:05.640\ngates and stuff too.\n\n01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.920\nSo it's probably, it'd be difficult for them to get out.\n\n01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:12.600\nI just see them cruising like patrolling from door to door and they go in and out.\n\n01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:13.600\nThey do.\n\n01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:14.600\nYeah.\n\n01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:15.600\nThey go check out like back gates and stuff.\n\n01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.600\nYeah.\n\n01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:21.200\nThey were, I mean, one came tooling down fucking, I thought he was just like a drunk coyote\n\n01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:25.240\nbecause he was, he was just coming down avocado.\n\n01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.240\nWhat's it?\n\n01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.240\nLittle Dom's?\n\n01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.280\nWe were eating outside of little Dom's and he's just down the middle of the road like\n\n01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.600\nfucking an REM video just like, everybody hurts, everybody hurts.\n\n01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.600\nOkay.\n\n01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.880\nIt's the end of the world.\n\n01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:45.280\nBut we had Harvey and he was a puppy and it was like, like he was, he was like just,\n\n01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.280\nit's crazy.\n\n01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:49.880\nThere's a family of skunks once in a while that will just decide to take up shop in\n\n01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:53.840\nfront of my front door and they're adorable because his mom and pop and a couple of kids\n\n01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:58.280\nand they'll just cruise up and they'll just sit on my front door and there's a Mexican\n\n01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.280\nstandoff that happens.\n\n01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.280\nLike they're not going anywhere.\n\n01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.280\nI'm not approaching them.\n\n01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:05.400\nIt's just, it'll be midnight and it's just, it's just adorable little, little pole cats\n\n01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.400\nsitting there.\n\n01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:11.320\nAnd they just look at you and then the dad or the mom, I don't know, skunks, yeah.\n\n01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:15.040\nIs that racist?\n\n01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.040\nYou made it racist.\n\n01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.720\nIt's got to be offensive to somebody.\n\n01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:18.720\nAren't skunks pole cats?\n\n01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:19.720\nYeah.\n\n01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:20.720\nYeah.\n\n01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:21.720\nSame thing.\n\n01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.720\nAlso, a Mexican standoff?\n\n01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.720\nNo.\n\n01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.720\nIn Las Vegas?\n\n01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:25.720\nOkay.\n\n01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:34.120\nIt's a gentrified standoff.\n\n01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:40.760\nIt's a, it's part Armenian, part gay standoff, given way to a nice place with wine bars.\n\n01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:43.120\nDo skunks make noises?\n\n01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.120\nNo.\n\n01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:45.560\nI've never heard them make noises.\n\n01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.920\nIf you hear something, it's the sound of them spraying you.\n\n01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:50.440\nI always stomp my foot like on the pavement.\n\n01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.440\nI don't fuck with skunks.\n\n01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.440\nBecause at one time-\n\n01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:53.440\nWell, I don't fuck with them.\n\n01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.600\nI just make, I just make a nuisance of myself and hope that they spray you with the skunks\n\n01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.600\npresent.\n\n01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.600\nNo, I want to scare them.\n\n01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:03.640\nI don't know what happened when I lived on Talmudge, the shitty apartments, Talmudge\n\n01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.640\nand Franklin.\n\n01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:09.360\nA skunk, I don't know what happened, but the skunk must have exploded underneath my door\n\n01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:14.640\njam because for a month, I couldn't even be in my apartment because your eyes would just\n\n01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:15.640\nwater.\n\n01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:19.360\nLike when it's in close quarters like that, it's like, it's like neurotoxin, it's insane.\n\n01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.360\nYeah, that stuff's crazy.\n\n01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:21.360\nSorry, Colin.\n\n01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.360\nSorry about that.\n\n01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:23.360\nAll right, Spencer, we have-\n\n01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.360\nHe's exploring a new canyon tonight.\n\n01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.360\nAll right, we're real quick.\n\n01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.360\nA kind of, a kind of valley of entertainment.\n\n01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:33.080\nA dangerous, rocky ravine that knows no bottom.\n\n01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.360\nHope you doubled your rope.\n\n01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:42.160\nColin, Colin, before we have you play possibly Camille's character in this, anything that\n\n01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.160\nmakes you cry?\n\n01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.360\nIs there a trigger for you that could get you teary?\n\n01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.360\nFlatland.\n\n01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.360\nMountains.\n\n01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.360\nHates them.\n\n01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:57.360\nLike in film or music or you see a nice sunset or a certain kind of thought crosses your\n\n01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:58.360\nmind.\n\n01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:00.360\nAnd nothing really actually crosses your mind.\n\n01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.360\nAre you a crier?\n\n01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.360\nYou're not a crier?\n\n01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:06.360\nBut sometimes when it strikes me, it just, I can't, I can't think of a-\n\n01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.360\nThere's not a genre that makes you cry.\n\n01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.360\nYou're not much of a crier though.\n\n01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:15.360\nI mean, it's not like you're rock solid, but you're not, you know, like super emotional.\n\n01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:19.360\nSometimes there's like a, there's a, there's a moving moment in a movie, but-\n\n01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.360\nThat'll get you.\n\n01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.360\nThat'll get me, but I can't really think of any.\n\n01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.360\nHow old are you, Colin?\n\n01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.360\nI'm 25.\n\n01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.360\n25.\n\n01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:32.360\nI, I, DeMorge was so amazing playing Mulrainee Sedana.\n\n01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.360\nI'm just going to pick up where he left off.\n\n01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.360\nI'm going to do it his style for now on.\n\n01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:37.360\nAll right.\n\n01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:39.360\nSpencer, are you good to go?\n\n01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.360\nYeah.\n\n01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.360\nSorry to make us wait so long.\n\n01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:43.360\nHey, it's cool.\n\n01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.360\nI'm not feeling great.\n\n01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.360\nLet's play.\n\n01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:51.360\nThat's the perfect music cue.\n\n01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.360\nYeah.\n\n01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:54.360\nThat's the sound of my stomach.\n\n01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:59.360\nWait, can you, can you, can you DM your, your stomach problems right now for us before you\n\n01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360\nget into that?\n\n01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.360\nGurgling in the soft darkness of the sack.\n\n01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:12.360\nYou feel that not all is where it should be, but soon it would get there.\n\n01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.360\nI don't know what that means.\n\n01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.360\nThat sounded right, right?\n\n01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.360\nWhat up?\n\n01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.360\nShould I keep stomaching?\n\n01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.360\nD&D.\n\n01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.360\nYeah.\n\n01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:27.360\nWhen we last met, our heroes had just joined forces with the secret order of the seekers\n\n01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.360\nof paradise.\n\n01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.360\nCharles Hoffman, their gnomish leader, shared with the heroes a magical tablet, which Quark\n\n01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:39.360\nactivated, causing a dangerous and deadly rip to open, sucking our heroes through to\n\n01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.360\nunknown lands.\n\n01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:45.360\nAfter licking their wounds, Sharpie and the gang found themselves in a new land, the Isle\n\n01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:50.360\nof Paradise, where they encountered Yomiji, the angel guardian of the Isle, who demanded\n\n01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:55.360\na joke, a joke which Quark gladly supplied.\n\n01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:00.360\nYomiji relented accepting the gang's worthiness and showing them to the plants of paradise.\n\n01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:06.360\nThe gang found the fabled Tarragon of Virtue and used it to force Admiral Darkstar's spirit\n\n01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:09.360\nout of Christopher, initiating an epic ghost battle.\n\n01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:14.360\nAnd after several blows, the ghost pulled a desperate maneuver, possessing Yomiji and\n\n01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.360\ntaking control of his body.\n\n01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.360\nThen Sharpie declared a retreat.\n\n01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:23.360\nBut would they truly be able to escape Darkstar's wrath?\n\n01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:28.360\nOr would they end up charred bits on the end of Yomiji's flaming shovel?\n\n01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:31.360\nFind out on an all-new Harmontown.\n\n01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:42.360\nAlright, so I think we all agreed we were running at the end and we cliff-hanged and\n\n01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.360\nrunning.\n\n01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.360\nUh-huh.\n\n01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.360\nYeah, so you guys have all that Tarragon of Virtue, you've got several clumps, you're\n\n01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:52.360\non the floating Isle of Paradise, floating high above the land and it's an island.\n\n01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:55.360\nSo where are you running to?\n\n01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:58.360\nI have a question for Sharpie.\n\n01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:02.360\nWhat is this Tarragon of Virtue capable of?\n\n01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:03.360\nMe?\n\n01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:04.360\nYou're asking me?\n\n01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.360\nYeah.\n\n01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:08.360\nWell, you can use it to do what we did, which is get our friend uncursed.\n\n01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:12.360\nBut can't we go back and attack Yomiji with it?\n\n01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:16.360\nWe can try, but I tried to feed him some and it was just, he's really big and scary.\n\n01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:20.360\nBut we're running while we're talking.\n\n01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:28.360\nI have my Armulet of Spring and we're in a fucking goddamn, like I've been waiting\n\n01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:33.360\nfor months game time for us to be in a place with growth.\n\n01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.360\nI forgot I had it.\n\n01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.360\nI could entangle his ass.\n\n01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:40.360\nAlright, so should I go back and kind of lower him along?\n\n01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.360\nIs he chasing us right now Spencer?\n\n01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:43.360\nOh yeah.\n\n01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:44.360\nOkay, so fuck it.\n\n01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:50.360\nI look around and see if there's any sort of like wooded areas or like bucolic kind of\n\n01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.360\nthings.\n\n01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.360\nWhat's bucolic mean?\n\n01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.360\nVerdant.\n\n01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.360\nSure.\n\n01:37:55.360 --> 01:38:01.360\nOkay, the whole isle is very verdant, but it's not super vegetated.\n\n01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.360\nIt's kind of sparse.\n\n01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:09.360\nLike even if you tried to hide in the one copes of trees on the island, I'd see you.\n\n01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.360\nPoor enemies.\n\n01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:12.360\nSharpie, is that enough growth for you?\n\n01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:20.360\nMy Armulet of Spring, which has the kind of entangle thing to it, how reliant on verdantry\n\n01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:21.360\nis that?\n\n01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360\nWell, the Armulet's not.\n\n01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.360\nIt has vines as part of it and it shoots off those vines.\n\n01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:27.360\nOh, you're shitting me.\n\n01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360\nI could use that on a space shuttle?\n\n01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:30.360\nYeah.\n\n01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.360\nOh Jesus Christ, I always thought it was like entangle.\n\n01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.360\nYeah, well Mulraine has the entangle spell, so she could do that, but yours is part of\n\n01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360\nyour artifact.\n\n01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.360\nJesus Christ, I was like Boba Fett the whole time.\n\n01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.360\nI could just...\n\n01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:45.360\nAre you saying we should turn and fight?\n\n01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.360\nI look around and see if there's any canyons nearby.\n\n01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:52.360\nNo, it's like an isle floated in air.\n\n01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:57.360\nIt's like a magical island, like a desert island with one palm tree kind of thing, but with\n\n01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.360\nmore than that.\n\n01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:00.360\nSo small, you're not giant.\n\n01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.360\nSo we have nowhere to run to?\n\n01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.360\nNo, it's an island.\n\n01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.360\nIt's in the air.\n\n01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360\nLet's turn and fight.\n\n01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.360\nWell, Rhode Island's an island.\n\n01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.360\nThere's lots of places to run if you go there.\n\n01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.360\nYou could go to New York, you could go to Pennsylvania.\n\n01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.360\nRhode Island's not an island, though, is it?\n\n01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.360\nAll right, well maybe that's why.\n\n01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:18.360\nWhy don't we try to light him on fire, burn him down?\n\n01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.360\nJust light him on fire, the guy?\n\n01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.360\nIsn't he like a monster?\n\n01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:23.360\nHe's a blazing angel.\n\n01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.360\nOh, he's an angel.\n\n01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.360\nHe's already on fire.\n\n01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.360\nHe loves being on fire.\n\n01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.360\nHe's gonna flame a shuttle?\n\n01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360\nHe woke up on fire and he said, yay.\n\n01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:35.360\nI think our only chance is using this tarragon of virtue to release that...\n\n01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.360\nYeah, he defended, he tried to use Mage Hand to get some in his mouth and he blocked it.\n\n01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:43.360\nWhy are we trying to feed it to him, though?\n\n01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:45.360\nWell, that's another point.\n\n01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.360\nWell, every time we do that, we've done it twice now and the spirit comes out of him\n\n01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.360\nand it goes to someone else, now it's in somebody that...\n\n01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.360\nI'm not gonna say we're...\n\n01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:58.360\nWell, if we kill him, it's just gonna come out of him, too.\n\n01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:01.360\nI mean, this is like net neutrality.\n\n01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.360\nIt makes you want to give up.\n\n01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:07.360\nYou know, people from Comcast are working for the FCC.\n\n01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:10.360\nEveryone that used to work for the FCC is working for Comcast.\n\n01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.360\nWho got us up?\n\n01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360\nHow did we get up to the Isle of Paradise again?\n\n01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:18.360\nYou activated a magical tablet that sucked you through and damaged you.\n\n01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.360\nIt created this portal to the island.\n\n01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.360\nThe portal still exists.\n\n01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360\nLet's go back to that portal.\n\n01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.360\nOh, shit, yeah.\n\n01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.360\nIf we're gonna run, let's run correctly.\n\n01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:31.360\nAnd then have him chase us through?\n\n01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:34.360\nUh, well, I mean...\n\n01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.360\nThen he'd just be in a gnome village.\n\n01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:39.360\nHe could fight the smoke monster from the cigarette store.\n\n01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.360\nRemember that guy?\n\n01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.360\nSo we don't care about the gnome?\n\n01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:42.360\nYeah, let's go to the portal.\n\n01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:45.360\nI mean, we've never been good people.\n\n01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.360\nWell, we did our job.\n\n01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.360\nWe got Christopher Heald.\n\n01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.360\nLet's get the fuck out of here, right?\n\n01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.360\nYeah.\n\n01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.360\nSounds good to me?\n\n01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.360\nHead for the portal!\n\n01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.360\nWe run to the portal.\n\n01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:00.360\nYou run towards the portal and it glows softly.\n\n01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:05.360\nIt's covered in dazzling, polygonal shapes that kind of slough off of it\n\n01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:08.360\nlike some sort of spray or water.\n\n01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.360\nIt's magical.\n\n01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.360\nIt looks painful, though.\n\n01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:14.360\nLike, you recall when you went through it, it hurt pretty bad.\n\n01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:17.360\nYour skin was rent from your bodies in some places.\n\n01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:20.360\nYou remember that as you run towards the portal\n\n01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.360\nand Yomiji chases you.\n\n01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.360\nShould we try to get him to go first?\n\n01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.360\nYeah, at the last second, let's all just jump out of the way.\n\n01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.360\nYeah.\n\n01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.360\nLook, I don't mind stopping, spreading out\n\n01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:44.360\nand kind of like, you know, attacking him from multiple directions.\n\n01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:46.360\nYeah, I said we put up a fight with this guy.\n\n01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.360\nLet's fucking do it.\n\n01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.360\nBut here's the thing.\n\n01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.360\nThis is just table talk.\n\n01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:52.360\nI'm not taking a turn having this conversation,\n\n01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.360\nbut I guess I should because this is what our characters are saying.\n\n01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.360\nI can talk about this all day.\n\n01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.360\nBut instead, I'm just going to talk about it.\n\n01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:05.360\nIf we kill him, it's the same effect as putting tarragon in his mouth,\n\n01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.360\nwhich just seems to be an endless...\n\n01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.360\nThere's no fucking end in sight to this.\n\n01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.360\nThis Dark Star ghost comes out of him,\n\n01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:15.360\nand it goes into someone else.\n\n01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.360\nIt's like Vietnam.\n\n01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.360\nThis is our Vietnam.\n\n01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.360\nYeah, but we haven't killed him.\n\n01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.360\nMaybe it just stopped when he died.\n\n01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:27.360\nBecause we killed... I mean, we... wait...\n\n01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.360\nDidn't we kill somebody and then the ghost came out of him?\n\n01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:33.360\nYou stuffed tarragon into Charles Hoffman's mouth.\n\n01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.360\nOkay, so we did that with Kumail.\n\n01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:36.360\nWe did that with Charles Hoffman.\n\n01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.360\nOkay, so we have never actually killed an entity that had this thing.\n\n01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:43.360\nMaybe, and I know I just said that I was committing to playing like Demorge,\n\n01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:48.360\nbut what if I, with my supplies, built...\n\n01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.360\nHere we go.\n\n01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.360\nDon't fall off a wagon just yet, sweetie.\n\n01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.360\nI'm not falling off the wagon.\n\n01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.360\nI was just making a joke.\n\n01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:58.360\nIt felt real.\n\n01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.360\nBut what if...\n\n01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.360\nBecause we... he jumps into like the nearest...\n\n01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:10.360\nIs he jumping into the nearest vessel or like the most...\n\n01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:12.360\nI don't think so. I think it's more random.\n\n01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.360\nIt's random.\n\n01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.360\nSo he's able to travel to like something far away.\n\n01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:22.360\nLike if we made like a decoy vessel that we could burn,\n\n01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.360\nlike if I was to build like an ogre with a crown and be like,\n\n01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:29.360\nthat's the king of all ogres.\n\n01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.360\nI'd have him there and feed him the tarragon and be like,\n\n01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:33.360\noh, I'm going to jump into this king.\n\n01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:36.360\nAnd we'd be like, no, it's made out of yarn.\n\n01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:38.360\nLike...\n\n01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:40.360\nAnd then we would set it on fire.\n\n01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:43.360\nLike, is he able... he's able to just travel.\n\n01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:44.360\nHe travels.\n\n01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.360\nI mean...\n\n01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.360\nI think maybe he's just around forever.\n\n01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.360\nWell, I...\n\n01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:52.360\nI didn't make him.\n\n01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:54.360\nAnd also I don't think he'd go into sticks and stuff.\n\n01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.360\nHe can't go into sticks.\n\n01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.360\nWhat if we took a pig's heart or something and put him in the...\n\n01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.360\nLet's just try to kill him.\n\n01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:03.360\nI turn and fire an arrow.\n\n01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:05.360\nThere you go, Colin.\n\n01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:08.360\nSleepy canyon air.\n\n01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.360\nYou fire an arrow.\n\n01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:12.360\nWhat's the damage on that?\n\n01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.360\nBecause you hit 1d6.\n\n01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.360\n1d6 plus what?\n\n01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.360\n4.\n\n01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:21.360\nDealing 6 damage to Yomiji.\n\n01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:24.360\nHe takes an arrow in the thigh.\n\n01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.360\nSo we're fighting this guy now.\n\n01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.360\nWell, he is.\n\n01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:33.360\nI produce my armula to summer and I create my fire armor.\n\n01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.360\nBreathing yourself in fiery air or armor.\n\n01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.360\nYou feel the fire's warmth.\n\n01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.360\nDo you want to do another thing?\n\n01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.360\nYeah.\n\n01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.360\nI guess I don't...\n\n01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:45.360\nActivating is pretty quick.\n\n01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:47.360\nI know what I'm on fire, I'm not sure what to do.\n\n01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:50.360\nOh, speaking of fire, the whole island's on fire.\n\n01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.360\nYou lit it on fire...\n\n01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.360\nYou lit it on fire, Quark, in the last episode.\n\n01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:56.360\nI did?\n\n01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:58.360\nYeah, I forgot.\n\n01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:03.360\nFire blazes all around you, choking smoke.\n\n01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.360\nWhy'd you light the island up?\n\n01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.360\nI don't remember that at all.\n\n01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:09.360\nYou used a flaming...\n\n01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:11.360\nFlaming sword?\n\n01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.360\nMaybe we should take this fight through the portal.\n\n01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:19.360\nI fire five fire arrows, which I guess are just arrows.\n\n01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.360\nYou can only do three, is three cool?\n\n01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:24.360\nIt says I can fire five arrows at once.\n\n01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:28.360\nSee, Demorge could do four with the Wisperer bow.\n\n01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:30.360\nDemorge, Demorge was so great.\n\n01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:32.360\nAnd I think that used up his only...\n\n01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.360\nI'll take three, that's fine.\n\n01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:35.360\nOkay.\n\n01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:37.360\nThat's a really good job.\n\n01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:42.360\nTwo arrows and red the sheet.\n\n01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:44.360\nTwo of your arrows strike true.\n\n01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.360\nThe other one, it just goes into the grass, the burning grass.\n\n01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:50.360\nBut two, two.\n\n01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:54.360\nYeah, two arrows just plunk into each of his shoulders.\n\n01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:55.360\nAha!\n\n01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:57.360\nA total 19 damage.\n\n01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:59.360\nYeah!\n\n01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:01.360\nI'm gonna venture you to death.\n\n01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.360\nI call it my Armourlet of Winter and call it a snowstorm to put the fire out.\n\n01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:08.360\nWoosh, woosh!\n\n01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:15.360\nSmoke coalesces into clouds which sprinkle sleet onto the fire.\n\n01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:19.360\nIt starts calming it in some of the less fiery areas,\n\n01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:22.360\nbut the blaze is still largely burning.\n\n01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:25.360\nIt's just more contained now.\n\n01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.360\nI'm trying to help you guys.\n\n01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:29.360\nIt's helping.\n\n01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.360\nBut that doesn't take very long.\n\n01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:31.360\nThat's like activating the thing.\n\n01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.360\nIs that my whole turn?\n\n01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.360\nNo.\n\n01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:34.360\nIt's not?\n\n01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:41.360\nI go into a rage and I do powerful blow.\n\n01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.360\nPowerful blow!\n\n01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:48.360\nAnd then he just starts talking about Unbreakable all night.\n\n01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:52.360\nI mean, it's really good blow.\n\n01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:57.360\nGoing into your rage and striking a powerful blow.\n\n01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.360\nYou do so.\n\n01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360\nWhat weapon was that?\n\n01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.360\nMighty Greatsword.\n\n01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.360\nWhat's the damage?\n\n01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:04.360\nThat's 2 to 8 plus 7.\n\n01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:06.360\n2 to 8 plus 7.\n\n01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.360\nDealing 23 damage.\n\n01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:10.360\nThat's you!\n\n01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.360\nYou're easy.\n\n01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:13.360\nDid some blow.\n\n01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.360\nPowerful blow.\n\n01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:20.360\nIf you're listening at home, kids, it's just going to do powerful blow.\n\n01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:25.360\nHelps you beat the angels.\n\n01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:26.360\nThat's good.\n\n01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:31.360\nYou don't have to force schizophrenic kids.\n\n01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.360\nPut me in your note.\n\n01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:34.360\nIt's all I ask.\n\n01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.360\nHe's not kidding.\n\n01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:40.360\nThat's the terrifying thing is he's not kidding.\n\n01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:45.360\nI don't want to be in it.\n\n01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:51.360\nIt would be a guaranteed biopic, but I don't want it.\n\n01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.360\nAm I up?\n\n01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.360\nSure.\n\n01:47:53.360 --> 01:48:00.360\nI want to cast Mage Armor just because it's not because I'm selfish.\n\n01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:01.360\nI'm just weak.\n\n01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:03.360\nI need extra protection.\n\n01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:04.360\nTouching your clothes.\n\n01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.360\nThey become stiff and armorous.\n\n01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:15.360\nIf I have time left, I'd like to try to ensnare this angelic biatch with my Armulative Spring.\n\n01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:21.360\nActivating your Armulative Spring, you attempt to do so.\n\n01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:24.360\nHe gets caught by the legs, by your vines.\n\n01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.360\nHe can't move so well.\n\n01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:31.360\nHe's not immobile, but he's definitely kind of stuck.\n\n01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.360\nNot great.\n\n01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.360\nWe got him where we want him.\n\n01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:41.360\nHe starts swinging his flame and axe around.\n\n01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:48.360\nHe's trying to generally start fires and attack people in his general vicinity.\n\n01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.360\nHe doesn't hit anybody, but he does manage to strike the entanglements.\n\n01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.360\nHe slashes those off.\n\n01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:01.360\nThen he shoots Eye Lasers, but he misses.\n\n01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:03.360\nNot your day yet, Meiji.\n\n01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.360\nNo, it's not.\n\n01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:07.360\nThat would be a constant.\n\n01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.360\nI want to try to sneak up behind him.\n\n01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:13.360\nPutting on your best sneakingness.\n\n01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:16.360\nYou try and sneak up on him.\n\n01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:19.360\nNot very sneaky, but you are behind him.\n\n01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:22.360\nI am behind him, though.\n\n01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:25.360\nI stab him with my poison dagger.\n\n01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360\nWith the poison dagger.\n\n01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:30.360\nUse that poison dagger through my heart.\n\n01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.360\nI hate it.\n\n01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:35.360\nStabbing with your poison dagger.\n\n01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:42.360\nYour knife sinks into his angel flesh, but it doesn't seem to do any damage.\n\n01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.360\nIt's weird.\n\n01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:45.360\nJust doesn't.\n\n01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.360\nMaybe it's because you weren't sneaky enough.\n\n01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.360\nSorry.\n\n01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:54.360\nWas it Jeff's turn, or is it Mauryam's next?\n\n01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:59.360\nNot today, Meiji.\n\n01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:02.360\nI'm going to use my...\n\n01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.360\nWas that your turn?\n\n01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:12.360\nShe cast Magic Singer.\n\n01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:16.360\nIt's about to get really hot.\n\n01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.360\nIt doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.360\nI'm going to use my whisper bow.\n\n01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:25.360\nAnd I'm going to whisper in Elvish.\n\n01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:29.360\nScribble.\n\n01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.360\nLittle baby.\n\n01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.360\nGo.\n\n01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.360\nTick-a-tock.\n\n01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:37.360\nCheetah.\n\n01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.360\nCheeto.\n\n01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:45.360\nBicycle.\n\n01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:52.360\nYou whisper with your whisper bow, but it only works once per day, so your whispering is in vain.\n\n01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:55.360\nNo, I wasn't.\n\n01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:58.360\nI heard it.\n\n01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:02.360\nYou could still fire three arrows, but not the whisper bow style.\n\n01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.360\nOkay.\n\n01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:09.360\nWell, so I guess I do that.\n\n01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:12.360\nI also blow up a balloon, because nothing matters.\n\n01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:18.360\nFiring three arrows, two of them, fly off the island, never to be seen again.\n\n01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:19.360\nGoodbye.\n\n01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:24.360\nThe third, hits Yo-Miji right in his pectoral and deals four damage.\n\n01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:27.360\nHa-ha! Burned.\n\n01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.360\nSpencer, what a surprise.\n\n01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.360\nSorry, Moment of Clarity.\n\n01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:33.360\nMoment of Clarity.\n\n01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:36.360\nIt always comes after doing way too much powerful blow.\n\n01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:40.360\nHa-ha!\n\n01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:45.360\nI cast Morton Canaan's Rock Bottom.\n\n01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:48.360\nI cast Staring Too Long in the Near.\n\n01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:52.360\nI summon Sponsor.\n\n01:51:52.360 --> 01:52:00.360\nI summon my Spirit Sponsor to help me get the powder out of the tile grout.\n\n01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:04.360\nIt lets you not be as crazed when you're on a rage.\n\n01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:10.360\nOkay, can I use that and do a power attack?\n\n01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.360\nYeah, yeah, sure.\n\n01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:16.360\nAlright, so I take my Mighty Greatsword and I summon my Moment of Clarity,\n\n01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.360\nand I do a...\n\n01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:21.360\nWhere am I in relationship to him right now?\n\n01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:24.360\nYou know, in front maybe.\n\n01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:26.360\nHow tall is he?\n\n01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:28.360\nHe's 12 feet tall.\n\n01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:30.360\nAlright, I go...\n\n01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:33.360\nIs he kind of standing with his legs apart?\n\n01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:34.360\nYep.\n\n01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.360\nOkay, I come running in and I change it.\n\n01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.360\nI do a Moment of Clarity Far Sword attack.\n\n01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:42.360\nI run between his legs and do a Far Sword and try to cleave him right in two.\n\n01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:45.360\nRight up his wiener, like through his head.\n\n01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:49.360\nYou only got one Far Sword per day also, I think.\n\n01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.360\nSo, you should be out.\n\n01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.360\nSay what?\n\n01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:53.360\nI think you only have one Far Sword.\n\n01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:57.360\nOkay, then I'll just jump into a Greatsword right through his crotch.\n\n01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:01.360\nSummoning a brief moment of clarity, you weigh your options\n\n01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:07.360\nbefore launching yourself directly at his scrotal sack.\n\n01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:09.360\nYou've gone from pretty woman to monster.\n\n01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.360\nCan I go back in time?\n\n01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:11.360\nCan I go back in time a little bit?\n\n01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:12.360\nSure.\n\n01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:15.360\nCan I put a little pteragon of virtue on the tip of my sword just in case\n\n01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.360\nand see if it does anything?\n\n01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.360\nYep.\n\n01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.360\nAlright, I go over whoever has a pteragon of virtue,\n\n01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:23.360\nI put some on my sword and just in case it might be like a poison,\n\n01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:25.360\nlike some sort of magical thing.\n\n01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:29.360\nAnd then I do the same attack up the butt.\n\n01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:34.360\nBeing wildly with your power attack, your powerful swing is not as accurate\n\n01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:38.360\nas a normal barbarian-style non-power attack swing\n\n01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:41.360\nand just nicks him in the leg.\n\n01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:44.360\nIt doesn't hurt.\n\n01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:46.360\nWhat about the femoral artery?\n\n01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.360\nDon't angels have those?\n\n01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.360\nNot angels.\n\n01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:52.360\nThere's a bunch of shit.\n\n01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:54.360\nWhat about demons?\n\n01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:55.360\nPowerful.\n\n01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.360\nAlright, it's 10 or 3.\n\n01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.360\nWhen's it my turn?\n\n01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:01.360\nOkay, I said check this out.\n\n01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:03.360\nMake it count, baby.\n\n01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:05.360\nMake it count.\n\n01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:10.360\nWhy don't you pick on someone our size?\n\n01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:12.360\nReduce person.\n\n01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:14.360\nOh.\n\n01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:16.360\nSmallness,\n\n01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:17.360\nOrdinaris,\n\n01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:19.360\nGiant is Angelous,\n\n01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:21.360\nCome Humanus.\n\n01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:23.360\nHe does so.\n\n01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:26.360\nShrinking down to 6 feet tall.\n\n01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.360\nAh.\n\n01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:30.360\nScribbledy-D, Scribbledy-Doo.\n\n01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:34.360\nWhat once was large is now like you.\n\n01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:36.360\nCliff Hanger.\n\n01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:38.360\nCliff Hanger.\n\n01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:43.360\nThank you, Colin.\n\n01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:44.360\nWow.\n\n01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:46.360\nColin, the sleepy canyoneer.\n\n01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:53.360\nErin McGathy.\n\n01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:55.360\nSpencer Crittenden.\n\n01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.360\nI'm Jeff Davis.\n\n01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:59.360\nThank you, everybody.\n\n01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.360\nYou're Mayor, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.360\nThank you, Zach.\n\n01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.360\nZac McKeever and Dustin Marshall,\n\n01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:07.360\nand everybody here at Meltdown Commons.\n\n01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:09.360\nWe love you all.\n\n01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:11.360\nDrive fast and take chances.\n\n01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:16.360\nThank you, everybody.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.001s"],"str_size":[162386]}
