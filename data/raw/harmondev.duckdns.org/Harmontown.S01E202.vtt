{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:14.000\nHello and welcome to Meltdown Comics' Nerdmelt Theater Harmontown, it's now in session!\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:22.000\nLet's bring out Spencer Crittenden!\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:24.000\nSpencer!\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:36.000\nWho has been demoted from his Comptroller role from last week?\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:38.000\nOh, I'm right on high Jeff!\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:40.000\nI heard you try to usurp my throne!\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:44.000\nI feel like I did for a moment!\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:48.000\nHow about the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon?\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:56.000\nThank you!\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:58.000\nThank you!\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:02.000\nAlright, yeah!\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:04.000\nYou left me hanging with a high-five over here, man!\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:06.000\nOh shit, I didn't, you know, I'm out of it, man.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:07.000\nI've been up all night.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:13.000\nI gotta go back to work after this fucking running on chewable adderalls and...\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:16.000\nYou know they're not chewables.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:19.000\nYou're just chewing on them.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:23.000\nI mean, they seem pretty chewable to me.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:27.000\nAny pill is chewable if you really put your heart into it.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:30.000\nAnything is chewable if you really put your heart into it.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:32.000\nDiamonds? I guess so.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:34.000\nIf you really put your heart into it.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:36.000\nYou'd have to have teeth made of stronger diamonds.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:42.000\nYeah, there's no part of the word chew that implies success.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:45.000\nLike you could chew a locomotive.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:48.000\nYeah, you just want to get very far.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:56.000\nOr does it imply that your jaws go all the way together and you do a rotating mastication motion?\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:59.000\nOtherwise is it just biting?\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:04.000\nI think chewing implies something's being accomplished by your biting.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:07.000\nI think chew, certainly more than bite, does imply success.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:10.000\nI was wrong.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:14.000\nChew is like a bite plus.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nIt's like a prestige bite.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nYeah, I listened to last week.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:22.000\nUh-oh, uh-oh.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:26.000\nYee, yee, yee, yee, yee, yee.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:30.000\nHot under the collar over here.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:36.000\nI did like the pitch that when Spencer prestigees, he becomes a controller,\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:40.000\nand I become Bud Friedman, and I just stand in the back and let people know.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:42.000\nI thought you liked that.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:46.000\nYeah, you'll eventually, we'll go from performing at NerdMelt to JeffMelt, yeah.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nI love that.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:51.000\nThere'll be little jackets, I'll hand out like Bud Friedman.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:55.000\nIt's a great episode, it's last week, and go check it out.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:59.000\nIt sounded hot as blazes, so I'm glad I missed that.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:02.000\nI think it's been a bit of a cooker.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:09.000\nOr is that just the friction from the UK leaving the EU?\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nOh shit, oh shit.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:12.000\nI love Brexit.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\nI love when you work topical.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:15.000\nBrexit.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:19.000\nI was in London for a couple weeks, which was a great time.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.000\nLoads of Armenians there.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:21.000\nYou were there for the Brexit?\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:27.000\nI was there, I exited Britain before Britain exited the EU.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:30.000\nBut first of all...\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\nIf you had exited just as they were exiting,\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:36.000\nI wonder if you would have gone faster than the speed of light.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:43.000\nI think the real bummer, I mean I'm sure there's lots of bummers,\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:47.000\nbut the big bummer for me is that I think I got paid in pounds,\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:53.000\nand I don't think I've been paid yet, so I think I just lost a few thousand dollars.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:57.000\nYeah, don't cry for me Argentina.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:00.000\nBut you get into a cab, I would get into taxis,\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nand I would talk to the drivers, and I'd say,\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nhey, you leave her, you're a remainder, and they would go,\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:12.000\nlook mate, I'm not racist, but you've got these fucking packies coming in.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:14.000\nThey're like, wow, yeah.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:18.000\nAin't no racism like a London cabbie racist.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:24.000\nI mean, oh god, there's a part of my brain that's like,\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nhow is the EU?\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:32.000\nAll right, what problems did he solve?\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nThere was a little bit of silver lining there,\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:39.000\nbecause we didn't feel like the kind of,\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:43.000\nthere was a little bit of a, it was kind of like when the Chevy Chase was going,\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:48.000\nthe thing was going on, how I felt when one of the, I think one of the palins\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:51.000\nhad an illegitimate kid or something like that, for like a couple days,\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nI was like, whew!\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:55.000\nBut then it was right back to the Chevy Chase and Wastemale,\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:58.000\nbut I just felt like with the whole Trump thing,\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:02.000\nlike the Brexit was sort of like, America got to kind of take a weekend,\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:07.000\nand just do bits about the United Kingdom for a while.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nThere's an article, I think, on The New Yorker,\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:15.000\nwith a tongue lightly in its cheek, saying that the UK has lost its moral high ground\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\non America is stupid.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nThey've lost that bit.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:25.000\nHowever, we're going to reclaim that in November, I think?\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nNo.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nNo, we are, we are.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nBecause our smart friends, our smart cousins are stupid too.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nWe have to prove that we're more stupid than them,\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nbecause we fucking are.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nIt's going to be bad.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:43.000\nIt's not a competition. We'll be fine.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nWell, none of it really matters, right?\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:48.000\nIt just proves that people don't vote intellectually anymore.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nThey vote emotionally, and they listen to soundbites.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:55.000\nThey don't listen to information. They don't even know what the EU is.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nIt's nuts.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:00.000\nLike, the number one Google search the day after it was,\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nwhat is the EU? What did I just vote for?\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nThey thought they were being protesters.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:08.000\nThey thought they were going to go, oh yeah, 40% of us said fuck this shit.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:12.000\nAnd they know 60% of you said fuck this shit, or 51% or whatever.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:16.000\nThey didn't realize that they actually were part of a movement,\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nmeaning the stupidity movement.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:27.000\nWell, I mean, thanks for the language to our friends over there.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:30.000\nI don't know, I'm trying to put a, just to make me feel better.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:35.000\nYes, thanks for the language, but they call the second floor the first floor.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nThat never stops being confusing.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nWhat do they call the first floor?\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:44.000\nThe lobby. The fucking minus one floor, I don't know.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:47.000\nWell, we do that in a hotel though.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:51.000\nFirst floor is, you're up a floor.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:55.000\nYou're looking out the window down at the street, and you're on the first floor.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nYeah, like a Holiday Inn.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:02.000\nYeah, it's the L, you press the L button, and then you go up to the first floor.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nIt works like that a lot of places.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:07.000\nIt's fucked up. Don't get me wrong.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:14.000\nYou've never seen an elevator that has an L at the bottom floor?\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nThe second floor is floor one.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nIt's fucked up.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:24.000\nYou guys are fucking, whoever's calling out back there does not see elevators as much as me.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nAre you just mad because you're not at the podium this week?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nOh, don't even get me started, man.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nYou had bits? You had written down material?\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nYeah, I didn't have a suit though.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nI know. It was a shame.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nI really get confused with the parking garage elevators.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:43.000\nIt says G and then P, and then there's an L and a B.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:46.000\nGive a brother a number.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nAlright.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nAlright, that's...\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nWe solved that.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:57.000\nOkay, so that was the cold open of the show.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:00.000\nA little colder than usual.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nBut let's heat things up with some guests.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nWe've got to bring them out like a bullet train,\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nbut I also don't want them to all compete with each other,\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nso let's bring them out one at a time.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nAlright.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:14.000\nSo let's first bring out, to keep the international business going,\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nlet's bring out your Kiwi friend.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nMy friend too.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nYour Kiwi friend too.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nBut I met him through you.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nBut he's your friend too.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nYeah.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nHe's sexy.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nHe's too good looking is my problem with this guy.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nI think that we...\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nHe just is that kind of good looking\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.000\nthat it's a little bit of a distraction.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nWell...\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nFrom the fact that he's a great actor\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nand he plays a vampire on television.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nLet's bring out Daniel Gillies.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:54.000\nDaniel Gillies!\n\n08:54.000 --> 09:02.000\nHello, Daniel.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nHey.

58:52.440\nwith another my favorite episode naked and freighters is like a Mormon dude who\n\n58:52.440 --> 58:58.360\nthe Mormons like they refuse to like huddle for warmth like that's part of\n\n58:58.360 --> 59:03.520\ntheir thing so if you're if they're doing but that's so many wives if they're\n\n59:03.520 --> 59:07.480\ndevout they have enough wives for the huddle I think if you're devout\n\n59:07.480 --> 59:10.920\nanything I don't know why you're on naked and freight but but but if you're\n\n59:10.920 --> 59:16.400\ndevout anything but I think this part for my memory this was a and I've seen it\n\n59:16.400 --> 59:22.760\nbefore as a Mormon person who blah blah blah the the the he was he kind of lost\n\n59:22.760 --> 59:28.760\nhis mind in the heat and he started trying to get this lizard and I'm like\n\n59:28.760 --> 59:32.480\nthe first day of hunting the lizard he grabbed the lizard by the tail the\n\n59:32.480 --> 59:36.320\nlizard kept is that the tiniest fucking lizard this lizard is the size of a\n\n59:36.320 --> 59:42.080\ngoddamn like your pink like not even your pinky that's like like the like\n\n59:42.080 --> 59:45.920\nthe and so it's like come out and it would be like on a branch and then he'd\n\n59:45.920 --> 59:49.800\nlike run at it and it would go in this little hole in there in a rock and then\n\n59:49.800 --> 59:52.960\nlike what at one point he grabbed it by the tail and he had it and then the tail\n\n59:52.960 --> 59:56.880\ncame off and he just had the tail oh yeah and then he was he just spent the\n\n59:56.880 --> 01:00:02.320\nwhole episode going that lizard still in there every day it comes out and it\n\n01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:06.080\nmocks me and it's all he started losing his mind and the fucking like lizard\n\n01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.480\ncame out at a certain point I think I think he started like banging the rock\n\n01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.240\nlike to drive the lizard out he wasn't even patient it was just like he just\n\n01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:18.320\nstarted banging the thing the lizard came out he grabbed it in his hands and\n\n01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:27.400\nhe and he just went yeah and then he and then and then I'm pausing in the\n\n01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.400\nnarrative but then he's just like did this victory victory cry and then lifted\n\n01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:37.760\nthe fist to his face so that the lizard could make eye contact with him and and\n\n01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:44.720\nwith no irony no no poetry no glibness out actual fucking Hemingway level like\n\n01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.200\nlike just me in the lizard like like like he just locked eyes with the lizard\n\n01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:56.440\nand said you like that you like that you ready for this here it comes and and\n\n01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:02.880\nbit the lizard's head off and and and and chewed it like like it was a piece of\n\n01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:09.920\nhubba-bubba was he just just as happy as the live-long day and I like extra not\n\n01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:15.080\nlike there was so there was contrast that was like oh man I get to eat I feel\n\n01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:20.280\nreally bad yeah I'm so sorry this guy did you he wasn't even gonna live off of\n\n01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.840\nthis thing he was more excited about how much suffering the thing had gone\n\n01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:31.680\nthrough is it naked during this whole interaction yes and yes that's the dark\n\n01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.440\nside of religion though that's what happens you're all repressed and you go\n\n01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.640\nout and you're biting heads off lizards they were they were definitely yeah\n\n01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:45.680\nthey were there I that's a great show I think it's a I think I mean it's a\n\n01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.920\ngreat show and those guys who because I looked it up because the queue I was\n\n01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.440\nwondering how much they get paid to do it so they don't they get nothing to go\n\n01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.040\nout there for 21 days it's like 4,000 bucks I can't remember you can look at\n\n01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:01.640\nit up probably whatever the guilt minimum is for a reality show no that's true yeah\n\n01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.480\nwell I know it's not even that because what they say is they say that you've\n\n01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.880\nwon a contest so the way they do they're they're a terrible prize that's what\n\n01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.640\nthey know that that's what's funny is they have this great attorney who like\n\n01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:18.920\nfigured out a way around I guess all the laws about like what if they die on set\n\n01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.920\nand what is the culpability so the idea is you he's he goes strangers die all\n\n01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:29.960\nthe time yeah what if they were strangers well it's a it's a contest it's a\n\n01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.800\ncontest you want to contest where the reward is you get to spend 21 days in\n\n01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.000\nan exotic location trying to survive while being filmed by cameras all the\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.560\nlizards you can eat yeah but that's a great show that's amazing I heard for I\n\n01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.400\nheard they that read the red tape didn't work out for that anymore so for the next\n\n01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.760\nseason whatever country you go to they we just declare war on it and\n\n01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:58.280\nthen you they send you over there and you're an enemy combatant oh wow so we\n\n01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:10.480\ncan just it's 9-11 don't clap are you wearing that a hat now\n\n01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:16.520\ncurrently yes oh good no but are you like have you I woke up from a nap and\n\n01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:23.400\nI was in a rush and I okay you pull it off you pull it off I think it's tough\n\n01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:30.640\nfor dudes to pull off non baseball hats I think so but you know Jeff Jeff could\n\n01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:37.280\ndefinitely be like a spokes he could be the logo for like a spot spy spy\n\n01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:45.040\ngarage door openers or yeah he's trying to sell you x-ray glasses our dearly\n\n01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.000\ndeparted friend Sam Simon I went to his house one time I hit a party and I\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.520\nwalked in wearing a hat and I had like a it was raining so I like an overcoat on\n\n01:03:53.520 --> 01:04:07.240\nand I had a hat like this on and he was what do you inspect our gadget I don't\n\n01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:11.160\nthink it's I think it's more like a it's it's a William Burroughs like you you\n\n01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.280\nseem like you would you would you might be you might shoot heroin and some yeah\n\n01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.760\nsome but not like the normal like like you know normal like white shooting\n\n01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.800\nheroin like heroin in a nice beautiful beautiful like opium dyn\n\n01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.840\nstyle is the reason why I'm fluent heroin the reason why I would never do\n\n01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.080\nheroin because I also the same reason why I'd never I've never smoked yeah\n\n01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:38.120\nwhy would you never do heroin because I would be I would really I think I'd\n\n01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.960\nreally get into it I think yeah that's the thing of heroin people get into it\n\n01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.000\nbut not I would get addicted to it like I've never smoked a cigarette because I\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.840\nthink like I mean now I wouldn't do it because I'd like I'm mature but when\n\n01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.880\nwhen when you're a teenager and people start smoking I never did it because I\n\n01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.800\njust thought oh fuck I'm a smoker I would like to have the lighter and the\n\n01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.720\ntapping of the thing and like a reason to leave of the room and go outside and\n\n01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.040\nhave a cigarette but also if I were a smoker I would probably be fancy about\n\n01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:12.760\nit and I would like make my I would go to this I have a friend that goes to a\n\n01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:17.600\ntobacconist in Seattle it has his own like numbered blend of tobacco and they\n\n01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.000\nmake him his own cigarettes like I would be one of those yeah you'd have like a\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.440\nmetal case and stuff yeah but if I were heroin I would have like an old vintage\n\n01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:30.280\n1920s set that was used by you know like yeah Greta Garbo's uncle or whatever\n\n01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:36.280\nlike and I would have like fancy like a nice surrender so the reason you don't\n\n01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:43.640\nwant to do heroin is you'd like spend too much money on the accoutrement no I\n\n01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.880\nwouldn't want to do it because I would die doing heroin but the reason why I\n\n01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.400\nwould get into it is because I would like the toys you'd like the toys yeah\n\n01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:59.480\nyeah you guys you guys you guys know my cat died whoa my god just to just to\n\n01:05:59.480 -->

have\n\n01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.760\nhad like kind of a kitty Alzheimer's kind of thing going on because towards the\n\n01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:41.440\nend she she she did she she really stopped caring about the dogs as much\n\n01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:45.040\nI always felt really bad that the dogs were kind of terrorizing her and like\n\n01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.600\ntowards the end she was sort of like she didn't really care where she was and and\n\n01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:53.500\nbut she had like a weird wiggle to her head that was happening and I kept\n\n01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.400\nwondering as like she was on thyroid medication I was like I wonder if that's\n\n01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.440\nlike the thyroid medication is like jacking her up a little too much would\n\n01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:05.560\ntake her take her in routinely and she just had a lot of shit going on and I\n\n01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:12.960\nand so after I left for Canada two weeks ago apparently the cat sitter came\n\n01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:20.160\nover and she was like meowing in pain and it was like walking funny so she\n\n01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:27.200\ntook her to the vet and welcome to the best podcast ever if you're never more\n\n01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:34.200\nthan a Trump observation away from a dead cat story but but she took she took\n\n01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:40.920\nher to the vet and she had she had she had pancreatitis and it was in such bad\n\n01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:45.360\nshape that they started prepping her for an emergency like thing like they were\n\n01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.560\ngonna like send her to a facility or something like that while they were\n\n01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.280\nprepping her for surgery she had a stroke yeah Spencer was there oh you\n\n01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:58.040\nwere there I got there yeah she had a stroke and so she was essentially like\n\n01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:04.760\nI had to like authorize the first I had to verify that's all I could leave you\n\n01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.960\nwas like describing to me the thing and I was like I was like so is the idea that\n\n01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:14.520\nI'm supposed to get permission like I couldn't I was like I didn't want to\n\n01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:18.560\nsound like a weird monster you were my idea yeah you're like put it down no\n\n01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:25.000\nbut I couldn't I had to keep verifying it but yeah it seemed like she was she\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.040\nhad a like a she was like essentially they were keeping her alive and she was\n\n01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:34.160\nlike at the at the door of eternity and I had to like give the okay like to end\n\n01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:39.400\nit right yeah she probably would have made it anyway but yeah she probably\n\n01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:46.560\nwouldn't have been horrible I missed you I did she probably was gonna make it\n\n01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.400\nbut good call\n\n01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.880\nhe's doing much better because she probably would have made it but like you\n\n01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:04.560\nsaid $750 cap like he just like revealed some like policy I had about they said\n\n01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.720\nwhat they said with the with the insulin it would have been like 758 yeah also\n\n01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:14.680\nyou're in Canada so with the exchange but I felt really guilty about it this\n\n01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.360\nwas interesting to me I was telling my therapist about it and I was expressing\n\n01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.960\nall this kind of self-loathing about it like like which I would tonight except\n\n01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.400\nlike I think she stepped in and because I was I was like oh man I just hit the\n\n01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:31.440\ndeadbeat dog cat owners jackpot because I always felt really guilty about how\n\n01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.760\nthis she was she and I were like buddies and partners and and I just kind of like\n\n01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:40.600\nthe dogs came into the picture and I got super busy and her last years were not\n\n01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:47.520\nthe same as you know the Benjamin Button 25 year old years with the mattress on\n\n01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.280\nthe floor and she and I just like fucking you know paint in the room and and and\n\n01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.400\nher coming up with ideas for my screenplays and me letting her hump my\n\n01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:02.080\narm because she wasn't spade yet you know like we had we had peaks with\n\n01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.240\nthat relationship and she traveled with me through several homes and intimate\n\n01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.040\nothers all of whom adored her and everyone that met her loved her and and I\n\n01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.920\njust felt agonizingly guilty in general because it was like oh she was neglected\n\n01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.160\nlike in her lap you know she just became like like she was a big house and she\n\n01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.800\njust kind of started hanging out she's like I don't like these dogs and it was\n\n01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.720\nlike I'm busy and I was expressing all that to my therapist and she said yeah\n\n01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:35.240\nyou know sounds like you have a lot of issues about neglect and like your cat\n\n01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:40.000\nyou know has is gonna bring a lot of that stuff up but first and foremost while\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.360\nshe's still your cat that just died why don't you make sure that you mourn her\n\n01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:49.800\nbecause what you're doing right now is actually taking away from that process\n\n01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.920\nwhich it was kind of profound to me I was like oh I was like making her death\n\n01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.440\nabout me and making it sad which is like the opposite of a cannibal going like\n\n01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:04.840\nthis is delicious Dan Harmon like you I think that you didn't eat the cat but\n\n01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.760\nSpencer did say I do have a text from Spencer that says she was a Spencer in\n\n01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:15.720\nthe midst of all this stuff like it was like Spencer like she might die if she\n\n01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:20.800\ndoes what do you want to do with the body should I put it in the freezer\n\n01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:30.200\nwere you sad Spencer oh yeah yeah I was all busted up are you being\n\n01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:39.840\nsarcastic oh no no not at all hardest man

some Canadian party it's Chris Cross Canadian just the\n\n01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.720\nfirst song in my head that seemed like the opposite of what you should be\n\n01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.520\nlistening to after your cat dies that story was so sad it made that man throw\n\n01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:46.120\nup into a bag oh don't call him out he's fine yeah somebody's barge in the

Cross\n\n01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:07.720\nstickers because the Red Cross actually had super were super regulated and kind\n\n01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:12.680\nof militant about the way that they were approaching everything like the way in\n\n01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.880\nwhich they were distributing well you know in wartime they were the Red Swastika\n\n01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:23.720\nI didn't actually they had to change that no I'm kidding I just don't Google that\n\n01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:29.480\nit just seems like the kind of thing that you'd alright too soon right so we\n\n01:22:29.480

River and this like you know the Ganges River\n\n01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:56.880\nthere's a lot of death floating down so there's like a cow floating down the\n\n01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.640\nriver bloated and and birds are riding on its back and I look at my friend I'm\n\n01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:07.800\nlike I just don't think I can handle all this death Ryan Gosling explodes out

a read on Daniel I don't know if he's gonna\n\n01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:46.760\nbeat us up or that horrible joke to Obama Ryan Gosling dropped from the\n\n01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:55.440\nsitting it was like that wasn't that bad he he dropped down like in front of\n\n01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.400\nObama as Obama walked away and whispered to Obama and Obama came back to\n\n01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:09.960\nyou it's like on second thought given my joke yours wasn't that bad yeah I just\n\n01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.080\nthink that's the coolest thing ever though to imagine that when disasters are\n\n01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:22.640\nhappening there are beautiful famous symmetrical men on the way to help that's\n\n01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:32.400\na really cool fucking thing this is Daniel this is your worst nightmare isn't\n\n01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:39.280\nit I hate this my beard smells beautiful so fuck all of you but what do you I\n\n01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:47.720\nmean what is that instinct because okay so microcosm of it obviously the so the\n\n01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:56.800\nguy who was in the audience and then he needed help I was still talking to\n\n01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:01.920\nDaniel like he was on stage Daniel was already in action like yeah Duncan and\n\n01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.880\nI were like making fun of me I'm the least funny person on the male was like\n\n01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:17.040\nwhispering to me don't point him out and you what did you do and then Daniel's\n\n01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:23.160\nthere helping we saved his life do we have an update on our honor on our yeah\n\n01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:29.160\nRyan Gosling to the hospital came down in a helicopter yeah on one of those\n\n01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:40.880\nrope ladders just scooped them up yeah gorgeous lat yeah the guy just called an\n\n01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:45.480\nuber and it was like Ryan Gosling is coming and then a helicopter shows up\n\n01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:52.040\nhe's somehow piloting and hanging off the ladder but then there's the dark\n\n01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:58.080\nmontage of stories that are like Ryan Gosling lawsuit continues as the woman\n\n01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:02.640\nhe pulled from the burning car asserts he threw out her shoulder news Ryan\n\n01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.680\nGosling's a brush with the Interpol agency and it's like it's like this\n\n01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:11.240\nmontage and it's like a fall from grace like there's no more you know we started\n\n01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:16.400\nto take Ryan Gosling for granted and yeah and then we started fucking shitting\n\n01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:19.880\non him and that and then it's like and then it's like and then the end of that\n\n01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:24.120\ncredit sequence is like I like still no word from Ryan Gosling after two years\n\n01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:30.760\nyears years years and then you go to this the Gosling cave or what I mean I\n\n01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:35.080\ndon't want to yeah I don't want to over develop he's doing he's yeah he's doing\n\n01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:40.840\npush-ups and he's like three thousand okay no I think he would just be sitting\n\n01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:46.240\nin there like like like when I wouldn't be I mean I mean that would be a sad\n\n01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:53.600\nmoment why would he be doing a three thousandth push-up because I think now\n\n01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:58.720\nhe's ready to go out again oh okay my version we're already at like he's now\n\n01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:03.400\ngonna go but and you can you put that right after the I mean but it's two\n\n01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:10.520\nyears spend any time yeah you're the writer well I mean he's carving Hindu\n\n01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:20.280\ndeities in this cave and sitting in front of them yeah it's like like sundown\n\n01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:26.600\nand then he's like he's like he's in a bizarre and he's the finishing he's\n\n01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:33.560\ngoing no to show but that show but that to to hop hop tipped it and there's like\n\n01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:38.080\nlike all these people are climbing him and kissing him and he's like a machete\n\n01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:45.520\nmachete much much much much and then he goes back to like this like 1800s like\n\n01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:51.920\nkind of like British colonial office building where he's a detective but he\n\n01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:59.000\nplays soccer with some kids on the way back oh yeah no it's like he's like that\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:03.440\nkid the kid with the like greasy polo shirt yeah yeah yeah he goes like\n\n01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:11.160\ngasoline gasoline sir mr. Gosling and he goes like oh no let me show you kick\n\n01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:18.440\nkick jump kick kick and then hop hop and then but that kid on page 70 what blows\n\n01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:24.040\nup that's right he notices he's cradling that kid's fucking body going when the\n\n01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.720\nkid kicks the ball he notices that the kid like he turns and there's like a\n\n01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:30.360\nweird like scar on the back of a cigar burn on it and he he stores that\n\n01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:33.720\ninformation later on he like he finds out there's a guy that loves to burn kids\n\n01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:42.560\nwith cigars and shit like that we were making a fun detective slash\n\n01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:49.080\nthing he goes home to his office like I said his receptionist is like a money\n\n01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:53.280\npenny there's kind of a sexual like like like pepper pots kind of like it's\n\n01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:57.040\ntoo it's too hot to be sexualized until the end of the movie kind of relationship\n\n01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:01.440\nand and she's like what's going on out there he's like I got to come all the\n\n01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:05.520\nway to Jakarta and there's a kid out there he's got a fucking cigar burn on\n\n01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:10.080\nthe back of his head Ryan he can't save everybody wherever you go it's like\n\n01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:15.240\nyeah what are the cases a walrus poaching happened on the\n\n01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:24.600\nthe Jakarta walrus poaching trade it's gone on for too long but it's great if\n\n01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:29.160\nthe guy poaching the walrus is the cigar burning man that's easy he doesn't\n\n01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:34.720\njust poach he burns he burns kids sometimes yeah it's pretty good it's\n\n01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:41.760\nthe way it's a lame villain man how fun would it be to really be part of a\n\n01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:48.880\nmurder mystery on a real train well it depends on what what end of the murder\n\n01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:53.440\nyou're not being the victim or even the person who's responsible for well\n\n01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:58.520\nfiguring it out but just to me I feel like if there's a murder on a train let's\n\n01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:03.320\nstop that train let's all get off right stop the fucking train let's go first\n\n01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:06.280\nstop you stop I think there's I think that the there's trains that need they're\n\n01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.440\nusing that track I don't think you can just stop a train I think well I'd\n\n01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.600\nprefer to have it stopped in that instance not if you're an oncoming train\n\n01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.680\nbut the closest way the quickest way to get to a place where there's cops and\n\n01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:21.840\nstuff is to keep the train moving if you stop the train who can get there\n\n01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:26.760\nbecause the track is already occupied yeah I get out of there there's there's\n\n01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.400\nbeen a murder on a closed but you're in Siberia the train's going through\n\n01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:36.880\nSiberia it's like a snow piercer oh it's snow piercer yeah oh man it's just\n\n01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:40.600\nor it's just a train I mean that's like I feel like when the when there's a\n\n01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.280\nmurder mystery on the train and you come into a station because you have to stop\n\n01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:48.280\nevery so often on a train the cops are too they're too visible on the platform\n\n01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:51.760\nthey come looking around they get they give the murderer too much time to\n\n01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:55.400\nfucking you know he's hiding in the bathroom he's climbing on the roof yeah\n\n01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:59.080\nwho knows what's happening so you know they should make train roofs a little\n\n01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:04.280\nless easy to walk I was just gonna say that and train doors they should yeah\n\n01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.680\nyou should not be able to walk out of a train door climb up on the roof as an\n\n01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:12.520\noption right there's a ladder reading leading to the roof and if all that's\n\n01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.160\ngoing to be going on all the time and there's gonna be that many murders and\n\n01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:19.280\ntrains then you got to make those tunnels higher oh yeah so the good guy\n\n01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:23.800\nyeah no but the good guy knows the duck right yeah but you know there's that\n\n01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:31.000\nold saying murderers on top of trains aren't the aren't the people that kill\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.400\npeople the tunnels tunnels kill kill people\n\n01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:40.440\ndon't kill people murderers on top of trains kill kill appeal tunnels kill\n\n01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:44.360\npeople yeah but if you look into those stats a lot of times what you'll find is\n\n01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.520\nthat this the statistical likelihood that the person that gets killed on top of\n\n01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:57.760\nduring a train fight they've studied this it's as you'd expect contrary to what\n\n01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:03.440\nmovies would have you believe half of the time the guy who gets taken out by\n\n01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.640\nthe tunnel is the good guy half of the time if you might as well flip a coin\n\n01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:12.840\nassuming a two-man fight on top of a train you know really correct sir good\n\n01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:20.640\ngood job 5050 you've got a math genius the statistic is it's actually very\n\n01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:24.840\nsimilar to if you have a weapon it's more likely that you're gonna kill\n\n01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:28.200\nyourself with a weapon that you're gonna defend yourself with a weapon in the\n\n01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:32.240\nsame way if you're on a train it's more likely that you're going to kill\n\n01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:36.720\nyourself on the train for sure based on these red the reddit videos if you see\n\n01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:41.160\nthose where there's a whole there's a whole thing happening and I think it's\n\n01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:46.960\nin India where these kids hang out the side of the train for it for thrills\n\n01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:51.720\nso they will like hang themselves outside the train and then there's a whole\n\n01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:56.080\ngenre now of videos of the kid just getting smashed in the holes and you're\n\n01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:04.920\nwatching these all night I can't get to sleep it's I can't get to sleep I\n\n01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:11.960\ncan't sleep I mean I can't get to sleep unless I see the kid getting\n\n01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:18.000\nmurdered and then I go right out oh man you gotta go to man for 4 Chan plus\n\n01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.200\nChina equals fucking crazy fucking well you know like the guy that invented a\n\n01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:26.600\nmicrowave he never wanted one in the house because he realized how he knew\n\n01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:30.720\nhow strong the magnetrons are and how like how bad they are for our bodies\n\n01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:37.920\nRaymond tunnel what a magnetron magnetron it tells us that we got a\n\n01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:43.880\ntransformer yeah fights Optimus Prime it's not a shot of nemesis to Optimus\n\n01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.800\nPrime magnets magnetrons are the business end of a microwave are the\n\n01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:51.480\nthings that cook your food I think I should be the business end of the\n\n01:37:51.480 --> 01:38:02.800\nmic oh shit magnetron no I'm Starscream oh I'm always trying to use that\n\n01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:13.880\nyeah I would do a better job making ramen Starscream I tired of your\n\n01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:20.640\nincompetence wait who's that character magnetron magnetron which is why he\n\n01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:29.360\ndoesn't have to sound like Megatron it's cool am I wrong about Megatron one guy\n\n01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:35.480\nyes one fifty-fifty I bet he's right\n\n01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:42.120\nmagnet that was the most outraged response he said that's how he's right\n\n01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:48.120\nthat he's micro is that the inventor of microwaves back there he sounded like\n\n01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:53.640\nlike like we could make that a guy was virtually dead two seats in front of you\n\n01:38:53.640 --> 01:39:00.560\nvirtually dead but that's what outrageous you beautiful it was also like\n\n01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.520\nthat 15th time today that someone has gotten that wrong that was the vibe of\n\n01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:11.440\nhim correcting 15 times someone said magnetron it's not fucking magnetrons\n\n01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.400\nmicrowaves the cavity magnetron is a high-powered vacuum tube that generates\n\n01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:21.720\nmicrowaves use an interaction of a stream of electric field moving past a\n\n01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:28.520\nseries of cavities hashtag and go fuck yourselves\n\n01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:39.320\nnobody was on the other side of this issue we just want a clarity you guys\n\n01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:44.240\nmade a fool of me but it's different what if I forget like I something fell on\n\n01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:48.080\nme right now and I become the Phantom of the Opera like I just I haunt this\n\n01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.720\npodcast forever while heating up your food you're both right because the\n\n01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:58.360\nmagnetron is the tube that makes the microwave so he was more right because\n\n01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:02.400\nthe thing that's going around doing the things is the microwaves yeah created by\n\n01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:10.560\nwell a magnet now this is which came first the magnetron of the microwave\n\n01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:16.200\nwho knows well I'm more impressed by Dan Starscream impression that's pretty\n\n01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:27.160\ngood that was beautiful yeah you can you do\n\n01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:45.840\nStarscream rap yes Zach you got a beat for it's troubled\n\n01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.160\nthe decepticons\n\n01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:10.160\nwell I'm an airplane but I'm also a robot\n\n01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:18.160\nfuck you mama so hard she got a blood clot I went to Sabatron I used to mow the lawn but now I fuck you mama so hard I fuck her all day long\n\n01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:27.160\nI need to decepticons I fuck you mama so hard I give her an aowat's for fucking me\n\n01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:43.160\nStarscream I'm flying through the sky I am a Starscream gonna turn into a plane when I'm fighting Autobots\n\n01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:51.160\nroll out hey I'm Optimus Prime I'm gonna beat you all of the time I have a matrix inside my chest and I'm a truck\n\n01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:58.160\nI fucked your mama cuz I don't give a fuck I've got a blue head and blue fists but they come on separately\n\n01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:05.160\nyou can't put them on a list of things you want for Christmas it's 1983 and your dad just pissed in this\n\n01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:20.160\nfreak punch Optimus Prime taking dark memories I got a I got a trailer that transforms into a combat platform\n\n01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:29.160\nthere's a little robot inside how to let your mama's pussy it's wide\n\n01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:40.160\ntake it easy take take take it easy take take it easy oh we should team up yes we should we both hate Megatron\n\n01:42:40.160 --> 01:43:01.160\nyes we do what are you guys doing oh it's Megatron oh dance\n\n01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:20.160\noh shit iron side is here iron side iron side iron hide iron hide iron hide\n\n01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:35.160\noh no look it's out look at it hello my name is mr. Johnson I'm here to mow your lawn son I break the leaves\n\n01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:47.160\nI'm gonna do it in a pair of greaves I also do larping give me a second\n\n01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:56.160\nI'm walking down your lawn and I'm pulling a thread on your mama she's dead she's buried underground under the sprinkler\n\n01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:03.160\ndig deeper I found Henry Winkler he's from happy days but I don't know what to do without ways\n\n01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:10.160\nif it doesn't tell me where to go I can't drive Ryan Gosling started to drive Ryan Gosling\n\n01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:35.160\nRyan right in Ryan Gosling right rock-oh-rock roll rock-oh-Rock oh Katrina\n\n01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.160\nThat beard smells good.\n\n01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.160\nThat's good.\n\n01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:49.160\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:55.160\nBalloons, how do you inflate them with your breath?\n\n01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:56.160\nDon't hate them.\n\n01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.160\nYou're going to need them for party.\n\n01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:58.160\nCelebrate them.\n\n01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:00.160\nPut them on a string and let them fly.\n\n01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:03.160\nNow you debate them whether they're good or bad.\n\n01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:07.160\nIs it a balloon that you'd possess or did you ever have the balloon?\n\n01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:08.160\nOr was it a dream?\n\n01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:11.160\nWas it all filled with air or would you use steam?\n\n01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:16.160\nIf you do, it might expand and take you all across this glorious land.\n\n01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.160\nYou might land down in a field of corn.\n\n01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:21.160\nYou might get outside and find a prehistoric corn.\n\n01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:25.160\nYou blow a tutu and some engage men and then you go all the way around.\n\n01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.160\nHistory again.\n\n01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:27.160\nYou got Stonehenge.\n\n01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.160\nYou got Columbus.\n\n01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:32.160\nYou got Plymouth Rock and I'm going to fuck this.\n\n01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:33.160\nPussy.\n\n01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.160\nOkay.\n\n01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:35.160\nAll right.\n\n01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.160\nAll right.\n\n01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.160\nIt's been a good show.\n\n01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:38.160\nIt's been a good show.\n\n01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:39.160\nYo.\n\n01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:40.160\nYo.\n\n01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.160\nYo.\n\n01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.160\nYo.\n\n01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.160\nYo.\n\n01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.160\nYo.\n\n01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.160\nYo.\n\n01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.160\nYo.\n\n01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.160\nYo.\n\n01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:48.160\nYo.\n\n01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.160\nWell, it's been a good show.\n\n01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.160\nWhat have we learned?\n\n01:45:50.160 --> 01:46:07.160\nOkay.\n\n01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.160\nAll right.\n\n01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.160\nSo.\n\n01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:16.160\nYou came down pretty hard on balloons.\n\n01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:20.160\nYou know, there's a helium shortage.\n\n01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:21.160\nHave you heard about that?\n\n01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.160\nIs that true?\n\n01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:23.160\nIt's a big problem.\n\n01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:24.160\nWe should probably close out with that topic.\n\n01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.160\nYeah.\n\n01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.160\nYou guys heard about the helium shortage?\n\n01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.160\nIt's going to be bad.\n\n01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:28.160\nIt's terrible.\n\n01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:35.160\nAll computers basically are made with helium and we're just putting them in balloons.\n\n01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:38.160\nThere will be a point when balloons are like, I mean, we'll probably be pretty old.\n\n01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:40.160\nWouldn't all the helium just be up higher?\n\n01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.160\nYeah.\n\n01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.160\nThat's the problem.\n\n01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:43.160\nWhy don't we just go up?\n\n01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:44.160\nGo up.\n\n01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.160\nWell, then there's going to be a ladder shortage.\n\n01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:54.160\nYou can't just pull it out of the sky.\n\n01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:57.160\nIs all the helium living up on the edge of our atmosphere right now?\n\n01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.160\nA lot of it.\n\n01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:00.160\nHelium is triple bonded hydrogen?\n\n01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:03.160\nIt sure is, Dan.\n\n01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.160\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.160\nNo, it's a zone element.\n\n01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:08.160\nIt's just, well, what is it?\n\n01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.160\nIt's twice as much.\n\n01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.160\nOh, no, it's a zone element.\n\n01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.160\nWhat am I?\n\n01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.160\nIt's fucking idiot.\n\n01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.160\nYes, of course it's an element.\n\n01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.160\nRight?\n\n01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.160\nSorry, I'm so sorry.\n\n01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.160\nIt's the second one.\n\n01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:17.160\nIt's an element.\n\n01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:18.160\nHelium gas.\n\n01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:19.160\nWhat is hydrogen?\n\n01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:20.160\nHydrogen is triple bonded hydrogen.\n\n01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:21.160\nHydrogen just fuses.\n\n01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:22.160\nIt becomes helium, right?\n\n01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:23.160\nNo.\n\n01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.160\nHelium is its own element.\n\n01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:26.160\nYeah, but you have to have, yeah.\n\n01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:27.160\nWe all know so little.\n\n01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:31.160\nYou don't want me in with that.\n\n01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:33.160\nI didn't know that was a thing.\n\n01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:37.400\nWhen I was doing the improv shows in London, one of the suggestions, like the gets for\n\n01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.160\nthe scene was, the world is running out of something.\n\n01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.160\nWhat is it?\n\n01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:42.160\nA bunch of people yelled helium.\n\n01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.160\nI thought that was just a weird thing.\n\n01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.160\nNo, it's true, man.\n\n01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:46.160\nIt's not funny.\n\n01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:48.660\nSo what happens when we run out of our helium?\n\n01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:49.660\nThe unicorn's all that.\n\n01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:51.160\nWe're not going to be able to make computers.\n\n01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:56.160\nBut doesn't the law of conservation of helium say that we're not going to run out of helium\n\n01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:58.660\nand it's going to all just be floating up at the edge of the thing?\n\n01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:09.160\nThey're going to repeal that law.\n\n01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:10.660\nAre we really running out of helium?\n\n01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:14.660\nYeah, yeah, because it's priced, not what it's worth, because you can just buy a fucking\n\n01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:15.660\nballoon.\n\n01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:22.660\nLike if the world was just, it would cost a lot more to buy a balloon because of how\n\n01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:27.160\nmuch value there is in the amount of computers you can make with that helium balloon.\n\n01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.660\nWhat does helium do for computers?\n\n01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:30.160\nI think it's just very cold.\n\n01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.160\nIt has something to do with like, I don't know.\n\n01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:35.660\nIt has something to do with liquid helium, this guy says.\n\n01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:36.660\nThat's probably true.\n\n01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:38.660\nI mean, probably just something with electronic stuff.\n\n01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:39.660\nIt's great.\n\n01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:41.660\nYou think it's used in coolant systems?\n\n01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:46.660\nI think it's just used to make the superconducting ships or something like that.\n\n01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:47.660\nThank you.\n\n01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:51.660\nThat sounds like bullshit, sir.\n\n01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:52.660\nI don't trust it.\n\n01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:55.660\nGet out of here with your other vomiting friend.\n\n01:48:55.660 --> 01:49:00.660\nTonight, let's all compress it and circulate it.\n\n01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:02.660\nI don't know what you mean.\n\n01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:04.660\nTalking about fucking command.\n\n01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:06.660\nCompress it and circulate it.\n\n01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:08.660\nGot it.\n\n01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:11.660\nWhere do they get helium?\n\n01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:12.660\nWhere do we get helium?\n\n01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:15.660\nWhen we mine it from the clouds.\n\n01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:17.660\nWhat about helium?\n\n01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:19.660\nWhat's the other?\n\n01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:20.660\nOr clouds.\n\n01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:24.660\nIs that right?\n\n01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:26.660\nWhat about helium three?\n\n01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:28.660\nWhat's up with helium three?\n\n01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:32.660\nOh, it's the worst.\n\n01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:36.660\nIs that right?\n\n01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:38.660\nWow.\n\n01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:45.660\nIt's a contentious but lethargic crowd tonight.\n\n01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:48.660\nWe're also fatigued by global events.\n\n01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:51.660\nEveryone in LA is going through the motions.\n\n01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:54.660\nSomeone went, fuck fracking, bro.\n\n01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:56.660\nSpencer's kind of

know.\n\n01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:41.660\nI did random research for a movie.\n\n01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:43.660\nI'm doing a re-random.\n\n01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:49.660\nSo I know that's what you use tungsten for.\n\n01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:51.660\nDo it.\n\n01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:53.660\nDo it.\n\n01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:55.660\nYou're going to say no when you're going to...\n\n01:50:55.660 -->

waiter and I'll come over and...\n\n01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:13.660\nHello, American gentlemen.\n\n01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:15.660\nWhat would you like to eat in this?\n\n01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:17.660\nNo, this is bullshit.\n\n01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:19.660\nYou do yours and then I'll do mine.\n\n01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:21.660\nAmerican?\n\n01:51:21.660 -->

01:51:37.660\nAnd we can.\n\n01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:39.660\nTake it away.\n\n01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.660\nI lied. I'm not going to do it.\n\n01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:43.660\nDamn.\n\n01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:45.660\nThank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.\n\n01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:49.660\nKumail Nanjiani.\n\n01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.660\nDuncan Trussell.
