00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello and welcome to Meltdown Comics' Nerdmelt Theater Harmontown, it's now in session!

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden!

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Spencer!

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Who has been demoted from his Comptroller role from last week?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Oh, I'm right on high Jeff!

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
I heard you try to usurp my throne!

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
I feel like I did for a moment!

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
How about the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon?

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Thank you!

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Thank you!

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Alright, yeah!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
You left me hanging with a high-five over here, man!

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Oh shit, I didn't, you know, I'm out of it, man.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
I've been up all night.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
I gotta go back to work after this fucking running on chewable adderalls and...

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
You know they're not chewables.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
You're just chewing on them.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
I mean, they seem pretty chewable to me.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Any pill is chewable if you really put your heart into it.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Anything is chewable if you really put your heart into it.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Diamonds? I guess so.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
If you really put your heart into it.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
You'd have to have teeth made of stronger diamonds.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, there's no part of the word chew that implies success.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Like you could chew a locomotive.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, you just want to get very far.

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
Or does it imply that your jaws go all the way together and you do a rotating mastication motion?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Otherwise is it just biting?

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
I think chewing implies something's being accomplished by your biting.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
I think chew, certainly more than bite, does imply success.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
I was wrong.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Chew is like a bite plus.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
It's like a prestige bite.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah, I listened to last week.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Yee, yee, yee, yee, yee, yee.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Hot under the collar over here.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
I did like the pitch that when Spencer prestigees, he becomes a controller,

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
and I become Bud Friedman, and I just stand in the back and let people know.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I thought you liked that.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Yeah, you'll eventually, we'll go from performing at NerdMelt to JeffMelt, yeah.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I love that.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
There'll be little jackets, I'll hand out like Bud Friedman.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
It's a great episode, it's last week, and go check it out.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
It sounded hot as blazes, so I'm glad I missed that.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
I think it's been a bit of a cooker.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
Or is that just the friction from the UK leaving the EU?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Oh shit, oh shit.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I love Brexit.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I love when you work topical.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Brexit.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
I was in London for a couple weeks, which was a great time.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Loads of Armenians there.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
You were there for the Brexit?

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
I was there, I exited Britain before Britain exited the EU.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
But first of all...

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
If you had exited just as they were exiting,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I wonder if you would have gone faster than the speed of light.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
I think the real bummer, I mean I'm sure there's lots of bummers,

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
but the big bummer for me is that I think I got paid in pounds,

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
and I don't think I've been paid yet, so I think I just lost a few thousand dollars.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, don't cry for me Argentina.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
But you get into a cab, I would get into taxis,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
and I would talk to the drivers, and I'd say,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
hey, you leave her, you're a remainder, and they would go,

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
look mate, I'm not racist, but you've got these fucking packies coming in.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
They're like, wow, yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Ain't no racism like a London cabbie racist.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
I mean, oh god, there's a part of my brain that's like,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
how is the EU?

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
All right, what problems did he solve?

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
There was a little bit of silver lining there,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
because we didn't feel like the kind of,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
there was a little bit of a, it was kind of like when the Chevy Chase was going,

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
the thing was going on, how I felt when one of the, I think one of the palins

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
had an illegitimate kid or something like that, for like a couple days,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I was like, whew!

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
But then it was right back to the Chevy Chase and Wastemale,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
but I just felt like with the whole Trump thing,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
like the Brexit was sort of like, America got to kind of take a weekend,

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
and just do bits about the United Kingdom for a while.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
There's an article, I think, on The New Yorker,

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
with a tongue lightly in its cheek, saying that the UK has lost its moral high ground

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
on America is stupid.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
They've lost that bit.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
However, we're going to reclaim that in November, I think?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
No.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
No, we are, we are.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Because our smart friends, our smart cousins are stupid too.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
We have to prove that we're more stupid than them,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
because we fucking are.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
It's going to be bad.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
It's not a competition. We'll be fine.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, none of it really matters, right?

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
It just proves that people don't vote intellectually anymore.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
They vote emotionally, and they listen to soundbites.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
They don't listen to information. They don't even know what the EU is.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
It's nuts.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Like, the number one Google search the day after it was,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
what is the EU? What did I just vote for?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
They thought they were being protesters.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
They thought they were going to go, oh yeah, 40% of us said fuck this shit.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
And they know 60% of you said fuck this shit, or 51% or whatever.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
They didn't realize that they actually were part of a movement,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
meaning the stupidity movement.

06:19.000 --> 06:27.000
Well, I mean, thanks for the language to our friends over there.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I don't know, I'm trying to put a, just to make me feel better.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Yes, thanks for the language, but they call the second floor the first floor.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
That never stops being confusing.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
What do they call the first floor?

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
The lobby. The fucking minus one floor, I don't know.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, we do that in a hotel though.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
First floor is, you're up a floor.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
You're looking out the window down at the street, and you're on the first floor.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah, like a Holiday Inn.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah, it's the L, you press the L button, and then you go up to the first floor.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
It works like that a lot of places.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
It's fucked up. Don't get me wrong.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
You've never seen an elevator that has an L at the bottom floor?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
The second floor is floor one.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
It's fucked up.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
You guys are fucking, whoever's calling out back there does not see elevators as much as me.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Are you just mad because you're not at the podium this week?

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Oh, don't even get me started, man.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
You had bits? You had written down material?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Yeah, I didn't have a suit though.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I know. It was a shame.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I really get confused with the parking garage elevators.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
It says G and then P, and then there's an L and a B.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Give a brother a number.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Alright.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Alright, that's...

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
We solved that.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Okay, so that was the cold open of the show.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
A little colder than usual.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
But let's heat things up with some guests.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
We've got to bring them out like a bullet train,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
but I also don't want them to all compete with each other,

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
so let's bring them out one at a time.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Alright.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
So let's first bring out, to keep the international business going,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
let's bring out your Kiwi friend.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
My friend too.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Your Kiwi friend too.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
But I met him through you.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
But he's your friend too.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
He's sexy.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
He's too good looking is my problem with this guy.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I think that we...

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
He just is that kind of good looking

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
that it's a little bit of a distraction.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Well...

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
From the fact that he's a great actor

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
and he plays a vampire on television.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Let's bring out Daniel Gillies.

08:44.000 --> 08:54.000
Daniel Gillies!

08:54.000 --> 09:02.000
Hello, Daniel.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Hey. Hello.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Also, your beard, Daniel. I just kissed you in the cheek.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Your beard smells great. Did you put cologne in your beard?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Or is that just a...

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I might have put a little cologne in my beard.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
It's Chanel bleh.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
So you just got picked up

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
for your fourth season of The Originals.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Woo!

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Which is a spin-off of Vampire Diaries.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Bleh.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
This is like the 10th year of the...

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Vampire Diaries started right next to the community.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
They were in the same time slot.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
We were little sister shows.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Now it's still chugging along

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
and it's got a kid of its own.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
We're doing a half season this time.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
We're only doing 13, so I can actually

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
see my family now.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
What kind of stuff happens in a serialized...

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I'm assuming it's serialized.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
It's not like...

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Yes.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I don't know what the alternative would be.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
What...

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
After 10 years of Vampire Storylines,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
what is...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
what remains to be resolved?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
What...

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Why isn't the town that they're in

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
either Fully Vampire

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
or...

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
It seems like an untenable conflict.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I never watched the...

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
What was it called?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Blood Simple? Blood Man?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Blood People?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
True Blood.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
That was like the most

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
popular one at the height of...

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I'm just...

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm not letting you answer the question.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I don't know if...

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
This is fascinating.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I was like...

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
On your show...

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I want to hear your pitch on Blood People.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Dude,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
pitch me Blood People.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Santa...

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Sanowano has

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
all the right moves.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Child, if you want meth,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
you want sex,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
you want a brand new trailer,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
you gotta come on down here.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Oh, and all the wrong

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
things.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Oh, well, girl,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
give me another champagne.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
But what it doesn't know it has

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
is a little bit

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
of a vampire problem.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Shit!

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
What the fuck?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Wednesdays...

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Are the vampires the Blood People

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
or are the townspeople the Blood People?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Because they have the blood that feeds the vampires.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Well, I think as the mayor says in the

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
pilot, he goes, look,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
we gotta fucking hold it together.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Because what happens is while the vampires

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
and the people are fighting,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
uh...

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
the Brexit happens.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Or something like it. It's like a Brexit analog.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
And so,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
the economy collapses.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And then the mayor,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
in the third act of the pilot,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
look, vampires

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
need blood. People have blood.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
No one wants to get

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
bit by vampires. Vampires don't want to

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
run out of blood.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
We gotta stop thinking of ourselves as either

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
vampires or people, and we gotta just start

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
looking at this as a town of

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
uh... blood people.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And then, uh,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
you never close your eyes

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
and then, like, the whole town's

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
people, like, kind of like the vampires.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Who do you cast as the mayor? Who do you have in mind?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I'm thinking Tom Scarrett.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I was thinking of Tom Scarrett, too.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
For real? Yeah.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Wait, is Tom Scarrett alive?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I hope...

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I think we'd know if Tom Scarrett had died, wouldn't we?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
So somebody look that up.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Tom Scarrett's alive.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Chris Christopherson is the fucking mayor.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Let's go with that. Well, that's the...

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
He's close, though, man. He's close.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Is it really? I think he's next.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Really? Yeah.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Is that terrible to say?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
What? Is what?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
You're gonna kill Bert Reynolds?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I'm gonna kill Bert Reynolds.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
After this. I need a couple more of these.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
You took time out of your Bert Reynolds assassination

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
to come here and do harm and turn?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
That is what I call generosity.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
You're in the middle.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
You're in the middle of assassinating Bert Reynolds.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
You got the job already.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
This is beautiful.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And you're stopping here, and now you're gonna go kill Bert Reynolds.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Um...

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Say what?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Scarrett's alive.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Let's get him, then.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Daniel, how many times has your character been killed

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
brought back to life?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Oh, somebody did a counter this the other day.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
You're talking about exhausted narratives.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah, it's...

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Boy, is this a bone of contention.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I gotta trade carefully through this fucking minefield.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Hey, I wanna have a job.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Harmontown is a safe place where you can say anything.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
You want about your show,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
and there's no fallout at all.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah, perfect.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Um... 11, I think.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I believe it's 11. It might be 14.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
That means you've gotten a stake through the heart 11 times?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Yeah, that's right.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
So in addition to normal

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
can't-kill-you-ness,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
you also

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
are a vampire that can't be killed.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
They just can't be killed. It's relentless.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
It's like, yeah.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Can you not be killed, or is it magic

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
that's bringing you back? Are other wizards

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
invoking their will upon you?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Or is it like they miss your heart?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
You know what? I didn't even know Spencer was here.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Yeah.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
He's so fucking beautiful.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Oh, thanks, Will.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I love it. It's just like, oh, eclipse.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
There we go.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
And this is...

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
He's the Carl Pilkington in the outfit. I love this.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
No, no, I mean that lovingly.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I mean that lovingly. Come on.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Everybody comes for Carl Pilkington.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Hey, hey, hey. No, that's true.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Dude, the first season of what was that thing called?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I don't care.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
The Ricky Gervais thing? Come on.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
The talker brothers.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Nope. The idiot abroad or the cartoon one?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
No, no, no. The one he did... Derrick.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Derrick. He was in the first season.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
He was fabulous. Anyway,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
nice to see you, Spencer.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Sorry, what were we fucking talking about?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
We're talking about how you can't die

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
even though you're a vampire that has death rules.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
That's right. Are you enjoying it still?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
You forbade me to watch it.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
You said, jive.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Well, I don't...

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I love the way that's my accent.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Here it comes. If you fucking watch it,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
we're not fucking friends anymore, man.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You forbade me, and I've held to that.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Also, I wouldn't have watched it anyway, but...

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
That's true.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
But you gave me permission to not watch it

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
because I'm a good friend of yours.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
All right, we should bring up

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
more of our friends.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Duncan Trussell's here!

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Is this the sexiest show we've done yet?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
It's already the sexiest

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
bunch of men on stage.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Now you're being sarcastic.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
No, you're gorgeous. You're sitting next to a sexy vampire.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
This guy is symmetrical.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
No, Daniel's...

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Let's not continue.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Do you have beard cologne, too, Duncan?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Are you one of those guys?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Yeah, gravy.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
That's true.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Duncan, treat yourself.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Lean over and just take a little smell

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
of Daniel's beard.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Oh, my God! It's amazing!

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
How did you...

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
How did you know that?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I gave him a friendly kiss in the cheek,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
and I went to an astral plane.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Yeah!

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
No, wait! I was gonna say...

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I was just playing. This is a really obscure reference.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I was gonna...

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
What is that Stephen King book that he wrote

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
with another horror movie writer

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
where...

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
The Talisman!

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
So, basically, you drink this shitty

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
vomit-tasting stuff,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
and you transport it into another dimension

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
where everything smells the way it's supposed

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
to smell.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Anyway, your beard

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
smells like the right way

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
beard should smell.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
You can all smell it

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
after the show.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Daniel, at least what we're doing

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
is beard sniffing after the show.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
It's only $12.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I hope that you guys aren't

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
flagged by my flagging energy.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
You know, like, I'll just put it up all night.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Like, I...

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
You know, it's hard to come and do a show,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
and then, like, you're realizing people are relying on you

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
for...

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Joie de vivre, and you...

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
You just kind of stand outside

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
yourself and you realize you've been

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
hunched over and...

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
speaking in a monotone, and, like...

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I have no...

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I'm desiccated.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Are you sleeping at all? Like, what's your...

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
It's up all night, because I have a shitty, shitty

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
writer.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Terrible, shitty person.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Shut up!

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
You don't know...

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
You only see it when it's done.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
If you saw the amount of masturbating

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
and the amount of, like...

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
fucking sad, I'm not a shitty...

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
shitty writer means, oh, he wrote a bad

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
thing. I'm saying, like, I'm a bad

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
naughty boy.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Like, I'm a...

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I'm not a... I'm not a professional.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I'm really just really, like, I'll be

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
handed opportunities that are, like,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
absolutely fantastic and easy

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
to knock out and fun

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
and something I'm passionate about,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
and then the minute that it enters a zone of,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
like, oh,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
you know, there'd be no way to

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
fuck this up, or, you know, I'll just

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
figure out how.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Because you got the book,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
you have 9,000 TV shows,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
you got a million deals,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
pitches going on, like, how

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
do you even organize your time between

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
all those things? I just let Steve

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
leave you do it.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I have another question, like, what's

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
your version of this all working?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Like, what is your... Well, that's the sad

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
thing. I'm talking to my therapist about it,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
is that I've never had a version where it's, like, worked.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Like, in terms of, like, having to write

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
original stuff,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
like, but it's been a while,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
because the community

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
taught me how to, like, work with, like, people

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
and on a thing that needed to get done,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
and when there's, like, a lot

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
of people involved, you can't fuck up

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
that much, like, but

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
when it gets down to, like, oh,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
this is up to me to do a thing on, and no one's

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
around to yell at me,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
so, like, I'll just, like,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
it's just kind of amazing, but I don't

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
know, and my therapist said,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
she said, uh, you're, uh,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
oh, let's bring out Kumail Nanjiani. We should do that.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Woo!

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
What the f...

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
The show is already sexy.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Hello.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Hello. Are we starting

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
a sexy calendar? What's going on?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I know.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
There's not a lot of gender balance on stage, but

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I don't think the ladies will be complaining.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I mean, we all look fine, but if you had to

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
guess who's playing a vampire on TV,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
it's...

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It's very easy.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
It's still so bitter that I got December

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
in the calendar.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Yeah, you gotta close it out strong.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
What month would you be

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
in a sexy, uh,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
hunky comedians of

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
calendar? What a horrible idea.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I'm saying

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
you had to do it.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I have to do it.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
It's something that you made some sort of

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
terrible deal in part of the contract.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Who else is in the calendar?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Duncan Trussell, Daniel Gillies,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
me, Spencer, and Dan.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
And then, uh,

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
who else? We each got two months.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
We each get a holiday month

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
and a, like, a free

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
freestyle month. Yeah.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
You get December, you know,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
it's like, fuck, man.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Yeah, then you get September,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
color palettes spoken for.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I have to take a bullshit month because I got December?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Why do you get December?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I didn't realize that there was a month people wanted

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
in those kinds of games.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Well, you don't want February,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I think you want,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I just threw up in my mouth. You don't want September.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I want September. September 11.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
But I want, uh,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
well, that's not going to be part of the photo.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
That's why you want it? You don't want that.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Oh, yeah, you don't want that.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I thought you were like, give me September 11.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I was thinking pile of leaves.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
But I guess in the background,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
there could be like a,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
a shadow.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah, whoever it is

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
is dressed as a firefighter.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It's like, it's like, it's like,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
it's like you're, you're in a pile of leaves

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
in a, in a, in a swimsuit and like,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
and you've got your glasses on the bridge of your nose,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
but if you like zoom in.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Oh, the reflection.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
The reflection in your pupil is like.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Not cool, dude.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I don't know. It's, to me, it's, uh,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
to me, it's a tragic event and

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
wow.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
What a stand to take.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Wow. You really put yourself out there.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
What a bull.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Trump kind of wiped it out of me.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Do you find yourself as a, as a,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
as a liberal, uh,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
uh, guy on the

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
internet kind of like,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
or just in regular life, do you find yourself

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
kind of like going to that muscle

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
that you used to use to be like,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
of course I didn't mean to,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
like, like, like, like when you're like,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
when you're making sure you're,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
you're speaking correctly and stuff, do you ever,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
do you ever feel like a muscle rip?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Yeah, I think it's good to just let that muscle

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
atrophy and whatever comes out, comes out

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
and if you could, because I know,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I know as most of us here

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
know,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
that Trump is going to be exactly what this

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
country needs and I'm not afraid

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
of saying it

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
anymore.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I think it's good to just let it, I think it's good

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
to let it come out and if you get us sailed

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
for it or whatever,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
you know, that's the thing, man.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
You taught me this thing that just stuck in my head

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
and the more I think, the more I think about it,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
the more I think that pretty much sums it all up,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
which is just

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
say, tell the truth,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
how you feel right then in the moment,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
let it come out, if that's who you are

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
and someone gets angry

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
at you for that thing, then

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I think you said it to me, it's like they're angry at nature

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
and that, you know, they're angry

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
at the wind or something.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Wait, are you actually,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I haven't seen you in a little while,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
are you actually supporting Trump?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
No!

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I was like, oh my god,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
there's going to be words.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Supporting Trump?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Well, no, I mean, no,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
people always say it's like, oh, he always

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
speaks his mind, well so do children

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
and we don't make them president.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Be a great movie.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Yeah.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Yeah.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
But he doesn't speak his mind.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Let's not give him pride.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
He's speaking like the mind

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
of some weird simulation of Tom Cruise

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
in his head.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Like, he's just saying like,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
No, I think all that, I think all that.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Like, I think that

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
when you look at somebody who,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
and I know a lot of people say he's in like,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
maybe he's in a shit ton of debt or whatever,

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
but he does seem to have somehow

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
manifested a lot

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
of massive skyscrapers

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
and usually that indicates

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
not some lunatic who just

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
rambles, but some kind of very manipulative

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
person.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
So, I think part of his deception

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
on one level

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
is to seem just like some loose

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
cannon or something like that

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
when underneath it is just a classic

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
all-American huckster.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Like, the, the, the, which is

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
a really old American tradition.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
It's the, it's a, it is.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Like, the old American con artist, the guy

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
like, comes into town

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
with a bunch of bullshit medicine,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
gives it to people.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
What?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah, fuck him.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Comes into town, builds a monorail

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
out of snake oil,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
and then rides it away.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And all, and then all the babies

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
die from the exhaust.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
He's like Robert Preston, a music man without, without

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
the catchy tunes.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah, yeah, so I think people,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I think that the scary thing about him

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
is not that he's like,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
oh shit, he's just a big baby.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
It's that underneath the big baby

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
is a very, very intelligent

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
manipulative being.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I disagree. I don't see a very, very

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
intelligent guy.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
There's nothing in there which reflects

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
to me anything but a complete emotional

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
and intellectual immaturity.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Like, I don't sense anybody's smile.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
See, because I was kind of waiting for

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
the guy behind the curtain.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
You know, I was waiting for the sort of

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
ball, and I couldn't, I can't see

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
that. I mean, maybe I'm not smart

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
enough to see how just how smart he is.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
You can't run for president and wear ball caps.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
No offense, Duncan's

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
wearing a ball cap right now, but you're not running for president.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
That's it, you're getting May.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
You're getting...

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
You can't, you can't, you can't

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
wear a ball cap

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
and stand behind a podium and run for president.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
But he's proving you can.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Yeah, he did it. Like, do well at it.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I read an article about this.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
You guys, I read this article about

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
the hair, he wears the cap

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
because his famously ridiculous

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
hair that's always

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
caught looking like fucking

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
cotton candy, you know, on

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
an autumn day, it's

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
he, like, someone told

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
him, it's like, this can't be part of

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
the campaign. You have to

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
take this out of the

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
equation.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And the ball cap literally does that.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
There's no more of these pictures of him getting

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
out of airplanes where he looks like a fucking retard.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Jesus Christ.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I really flew off the handle there.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
You really look bad though, I'm sorry.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Spencer, even Reddit will give you

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
that one for free because you're talking about Trump.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
His hair looks crazy.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
It doesn't look like someone who can touch

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
their hair. I think

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
he's a new

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
breed of politician that has

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
recognized

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
a demographic in the world

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
which is

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
a demographic that maybe

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
isn't the smartest demographic

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
ever. Maybe. Yeah.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I'm trying to be, I don't want to be

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
an ass. No, I

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
truly think that if you support Trump, you're either

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
stupid or evil. Well,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I really think that.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Or

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
one of the blood people.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Whatever

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
it may be, like, you know the

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
there's the guy who's now going to be the prime minister

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
in the UK where there's the famous

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
video of him ziplining. Who's

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
also got Trump hair? Yeah.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
They have their version of Trump. I'm telling you,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
you're looking at the new

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
politician. It's all versions

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
of this brand new kind of

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
politician that's recognized. They all have

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
crazy smoky orange hair. And they figured out

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
the car, you know, like when you watch

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
resale furniture

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
commercials or car commercials

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
and the guy's like tap dancing

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
and he's like juggling in front of some cars

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and I'm like, does that work? That can't

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
work, but it must work because they keep

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
doing it. It's the presidential

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
political version of that where they

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
figured out if I get in front

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
of like a TV king.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Yeah, that's it. A mattress king.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
That's what it is. He's a mattress king.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
They figured out that that works.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Fuck.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Fuck.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
But I still don't. I mean, I...

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You're killing me, EU.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Yeah. Well, whatever. Anyways.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
You can listen to a different podcast

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
to find out that that guy's

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
a bad idea for everybody.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
But

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
let me pick things up a notch with my

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
energy.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
How do you

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
chew an Adderall and be this

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
low energy?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Well, it's not his first

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Adderall. Yeah, it's been a while.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
All right, you want to take a little...

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
You can just lay down and take a little nap. We'll take over the show.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
We have the Rosanna Arquette him with the

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
fucking adrenaline.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
The needle, that adrenaline needle? Yeah.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Or we can steak me for the 12th

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
fucking time.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Unbelievable. So who is

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
staking you?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I mean, who gives a shit?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Do you really give a shit?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Is your Van Helsing another

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
hunky guy?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Or is it like an old...

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I'm the old guy on the show.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I'm like...

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Are you a bad guy?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I don't know. I don't think anybody can be really deemed good

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
when there's sort of this murderous

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
creature thing.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
But I mean, you know, I...

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
God, I'm already bored of hearing myself talking about this shit.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Um...

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Yes, I'm kind of a bad dude.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
But you're following me and

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
my brother's shenanigans

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
in New Orleans.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
God, it's boring. No, it sounds...

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I just haven't watched it, but it's like...

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Have you read the Anne Rice books?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
No, I have not.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Man, they're great. And when you go to

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
New Orleans, that place

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
seems like there should be vampires there.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
It would make sense that you'd run into

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
vampires there. That's a haunted city.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Totally.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Is Diaries based on an Anne Rice property?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
No, it is not.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Just a second.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I don't even know the name of the writer.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Got it.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Thank you.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
You know what happened to me?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I met Obama two days ago.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Wow!

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
This is The Notch.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
What's that? Malia?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Was he cool? No.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Which one?

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
The main guy.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Oh, really?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Yeah, I met D. Obama.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Wait, wait.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
We'll tell us more. Why?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Okay, so...

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
There was a conference

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
and it was a very serious conference

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
and Barack Obama was going to speak at it

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
and they were like...

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
which is a terrible idea, they were like,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Silicon Valley guys should go and do 10 minutes

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
before, like, open for the president.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
What?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
We went on in this very serious conference

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
where people from Rwanda

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
and Jamaica have been talking about

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
how they're trying to get entrepreneurship

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
going in their countries.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
We went on and tried to not say cunt.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Did you tell the Pakistan

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
porn tape story?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
No.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
That's good.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
It was chaos.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
No, no, no, no, no.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Because they were like,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
if you swear on stage

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
you won't get to meet the president.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
That's literally what they told us.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
We didn't swear on stage

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
and then we got to meet him.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Do you think that's his rule?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Like he said, I don't want to meet anyone who curses.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
He doesn't give a fuck.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Did anybody really say that?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Yes, I swear.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
What?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
They should not have.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Was it a stage manager?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
No, no, one of the organizers

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
of the summit was like...

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I want this context too.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
She said...

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
It's not bad that it's a she.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
No, it's a man.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
It's just like you would assume

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
that a summit could only be run by a dude.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Let's be honest, we're all curious

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
to know whether or not it was a terrifying woman.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Because I want to know if she's representing the language.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Because she's representing, hey, don't...

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
If she's there to say, hey...

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
She had authority

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
and she said...

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
She talked about this and she was like, oh, and one more thing.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
If you swear on stage,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
you won't get to meet the president.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
How did that get to be one more thing

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
and not the first thing?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I don't know. This was like two hours

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
into the brief, the meeting that we had.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Yeah.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
How organized was this summit?

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Organized as fuck, dude.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Barack Obama was there.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Right.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
So she lays down the law.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
That's not like a Harmontown where they're like,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
let's see who shows up today.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
It's not like he texted him that day.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Hey, do you have room tonight?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I'm going to stop by and blow your minds

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
with a 20-minute speech

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
that's going to make you cry and laugh.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
And so we saw him speak

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
and he gave this great...

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
And then he hosted a panel and then we met him afterwards

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
and he hadn't seen the show.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
He was like, I'm sorry, I haven't seen the show.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
And I was like, well, you have a lot on your plate.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
And he said, I'll binge it in six months.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
He did.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
For real?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
And then I kind of made a bad joke.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
I did a bad joke.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I did a bad joke.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
So we met him and he was very nice.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And then he was like,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
it's good. He was like, funny people

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
don't turn into shooters.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
That's what he said.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Wow.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
No, but it got a huge laugh.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Everybody's laughing.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I don't know.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Sirhan Sirhan had a pretty tight five.

34:12.000 --> 34:18.000
Yeah.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I think it's just sad that the problem

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
is that severe that he's thinking about.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
But honestly, he's like,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
there's another...

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
that you were one of eight categories of people

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
he met that day.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
And one was a postal union or something.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
And he was just like,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
it's good to be here.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
I gotta go.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
What was your joke? What did you say?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
So he said funny people don't

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
become shooters and everybody laughed.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
And I said, but that doesn't mean

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
that unfunny people are all shooters.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
And then it was like silent

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
for five minutes.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
And he said, yeah, that's not

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
what I meant.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
And I was like,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I am so sorry.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I'm going to go.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
My ears turn red.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
And you thought to yourself, I should have said

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
cunt on stage.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
I avoided all of them.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
And I saw him like cross Silicon Valley

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
off his binge list.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
The last ship went up one night.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Yeah.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
But he was...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
he was very nice.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Always wanted to see that last ship.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I'm trying to do Obama.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
What is that show about? Is it about

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
all the ships are gone and there's only one ship left?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Really? I honestly don't know.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I think there's some kind of

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
there's explosions

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
on the shore

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
and there's a ship.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
It's like someone with a disease. I don't know.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Disease and explosions?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
It's like a quarantiney thing.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
It's a quarantine drama.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Oh, and then the ship is on the ocean

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
and they're the only ones that don't know what's happening on the...

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I think they can't go to land, maybe.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
That is how they pitched it.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
So it's like...

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Maybe?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
It's like Star Trek,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
where aliens are sick people

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
and space is really small

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
and wet.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
And there's no hollow down.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
No.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Um...

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Hey, you know what I bummed out

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
didn't last more than four episodes?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Doomsday Preppers.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
There's only four episodes?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Yeah, because...

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I talked to somebody that

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
knew people that like producers on it

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
that the first couple were actual

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
people at Doomsday Prep.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
The rest was completely just fabricated.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
But they got actors?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
They just found people...

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I bet I know. They would find people

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
and go, oh, I hear you're

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
kind of passionate about

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
the poles reversing. Yeah, I am.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Do you like macaroni?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Yeah, I do.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Would you be willing to hold these

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
giant prop bags of macaroni

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
and say, when the poles shift,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I'm going to have all the macaroni I can eat?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Yeah, it turns out

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
there's not three seasons

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
worth of people that are awesomely

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
prepping for the Doomsday Prep.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Or if they're legit, they probably don't want to

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
talk to a fucking New World Order camera crew.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Yeah, or they're hard to find.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
They're not going on

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
the Lifetime Networks website.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
The most impressive shit I saw

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
the thing that I was like, that's my

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Doomsday Jam was the shipping container

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
thing where you

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
get a bunch of shipping containers.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
They're super cheap. They're bullet proof.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
They're tornado proof.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
They're everything proof. I think they're even

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
you know, they're closer

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
to being fallout proof

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
than say, I don't know,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
a hat.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
But

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
they have doors.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Yeah, I'm not saying

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
run, get in a shipping container

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
if there's nuclear war and you're going to be fine.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
They bury it.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
You can bury them

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
and make a little insta

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Dungeon.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I don't want to be a nag. You can't just bury

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
them though.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Will you get a hole in the top?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
No.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I got to tell you, I've been looking this up

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
since I was in high school

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
and according to leading

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
structural engineers

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
you bury one of those things

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
it crunches inwards like a can.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
It's not designed to store

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
shit.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Well you can do it, you just got to reinforce it

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
and at that point just build a bunker.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Oh man, I'm not sitting inside

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
anything that would crush like a can

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
if it wasn't reinforced.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
But it's such a romantic idea

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
to be in a box under the fucking

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
ground, it would be the best.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
You're going to end up there.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
That's all I want.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
With John Goodman apparently.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I met a guy who

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
or I interviewed a guy

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
who bought a limestone

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
like the United States military

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
hollowed out this

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
massive, I think it was a limestone.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
American psyche? What's that? Nothing.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Hollowed out this mountain

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
and he put all these RVs inside

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
of it.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Basically you can lease a space in it

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
drive your RV

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
under the mountain

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
and then when the apocalypse happens

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
you've got to make it to the mountain

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
but then you have a place to stay.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
It was massive.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
It's awesome. It's crazy under there

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
and the creepiest thing was

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
there's all these RVs that he's lined up

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
in this limestone cave

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
and next to one of them I guess to indicate

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
to prospective clients that it's a kid friendly place

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
he's put some

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
astroturf and a little kids bike

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
and like

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
like a ball.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
It was the spookiest thing

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
you've ever seen

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
and you realize this guy who is giving me the tour

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
he's going to be

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
god under this mountain

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
when they seal the door.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
The overseer. Yeah, he was the overseer.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
It was really creepy. The underseer.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
But also the place had a wine bar.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
It was like that was part of it.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Whoa!

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Now I'm in. Now you got me.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Wait, are people

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
buying spots? How much is a spot?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Well see, I

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
don't remember how much the spot was.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
It was actually, it was pretty reasonable.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I remember it was like

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
for like the end of the world

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
and having a place to go to or the fantasy

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
that you have a place to go to

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
because he's taking care of all the prep shit.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
He's filling the jukebox with

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I think we're alone now.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Yeah.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Yeah it's all theme songs

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
where you're like in the beginning it was cool

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
they were all apocalypse themed but

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
after a year

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
it's the end of the world.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Fuck this.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
We did

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
years ago like after like

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I think like 2002

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
we did some USO tours with Drew Carey

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
that did an improv like for the troops around

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
and we did one show

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
up in Stavanger, Norway

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
for NATO troops.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
So a lot of doctors and

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
highfalutin fancy pants that worked for NATO

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
and we went and visited

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Hitler's Northern Bunker

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
which was a giant

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
complex carved into

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
a mountain like our actual

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
superhero.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Super villain.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Whoa.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Oh shit.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Wow.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
But really.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Look he had some ideas.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Yes.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
He made the trains run on time.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
It was straight up

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
super villain Lex Luthor's shit.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And also

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
picture a giant mountain with giant

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
tunnels built by Nazi

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
engineers.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
It looked exactly like that. It looked like

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
super villain Lair. It wasn't fun.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
It was really

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
like Dr. Evil shit.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Were you shocked that Hitler's bunker wasn't fun?

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
would have thought. There would be like

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
a bike and a kids ball.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
There was no wine bar.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Where was the fucking wine bar, Hitler?

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
That's the real crime.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I should think it's kind of funny

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
that like I think we've talked about this

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
before. You know the meme of

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Hitler from that movie and

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
everything's been done with the subtitles.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
And then there was a guy

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
who like

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
we had to have talked about this. There was

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
some guy who

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
have no idea what corporation it was but

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
like

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
some butter company or something

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
like I don't know tried using that

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Hitler meme to like do like a little thing

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
about their butter or something and everyone

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
was like well now we can't buy your butter

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
and he's like but everybody else does it.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
It's

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
kind of funny how

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
our S&P

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
is kind of projected inward

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
or outward from some weird

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
core of our body that's actually just

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
we're just thinking like

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
no one was offended

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
by that in relation to butter

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
but everyone was like you can't sell

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
butter and do that

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
because if you do

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
it's more like we monitor each other

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
for like a flickering LED

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
we just like thump it when it's like

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
flickering too much. It doesn't have anything

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
to do with it actually being offended it's just like

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
well if you haven't gotten the part

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
if you can't figure out that

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
what was Hitler's angle in that

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
I have no idea.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Oh you know like what's the movie called

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Downfall

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
You've seen it?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
People put subtitles to Hitler losing his

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
shit when he realizes that the Russians are coming

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
and he's losing the war and so it'll be about

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
the Dallas Cowboys are having another bad season

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
and they just change the subtitles

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
to why Hitler is all bummed out.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Yeah Conan leaving

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
whatever.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Pop cultural usually like large events

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
or the new iPhone is

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Warcraft update

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
people don't like will often make it in there.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Some guy

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
who was technically

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
accountable to some company like

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
not Entenmins but something like

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
was like

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Entenmins did a thing remember what was it

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I can't remember.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
It was the

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
I love this shit I'm sorry

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
I was one of the coffee table

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
book of this but what book

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I could just go on the internet

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
but

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
the girl I'm laughing because

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
the

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
the kill

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
you okay Dan?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
The there was a

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
now I'm laughing because of what I have to

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
now say after laughing this much there was

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
a lady who was famous for killing her baby

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
you're right that is funny

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
is that a KC

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
whatever yes the KC Anthony

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
verdict was what not

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
guilty

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
the trending

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
topic was not guilty

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
and so some

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
like kid that worked at Entenmins

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I think it was was like

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
who's not guilty of

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
eating a delicious

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
brownie

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
that person was just thinking like oh shit

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
I got to get up on this trend

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
like everyone's talking about not guilty

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
for some reason

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
because of a baby murder

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
specifically an unpunished

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
one

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
so it just kind of looked like they were like

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
yeah

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
but they weren't even trying

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
to do that obviously they weren't actually making

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
it they didn't know they were probably like oh it's

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
a trending topic yeah one more

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
customer that's gonna be out that can buy

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Entenmins

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
anyways I like

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
that stuff I love the triumvirate of

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Trump, KC Anthony

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
and Hitler

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
this is going beautifully

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
did you guys watch the OJ documentary

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
by the way

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
no not the documentary no

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
you got to see it I just I was away

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I just heard about it oh it's amazing

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
because it's about I didn't know

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
like the LAPD

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
and so the racial inequality 60 70s

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
80s and then

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
with OJ's career and then 90s

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
obviously you know he killed two people

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
and

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
it's pretty I didn't know did he

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Camille did he 100%

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
okay wait don't you remember

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
that book you tried if I

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
if I did it if I did it it would

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
have gone a little something yeah

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
no I didn't do it I like this

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
do you guys see the cover of that

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
book now everyone's like oh yeah

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
if I did it I get a big joke

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
but if you actually see the cover

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
in big red letters it said I

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
did it and then inside

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
if you know why

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
cause like it's very clear

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
but Ron Goldman's parents

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
got the rights to the book and they

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
redesigned the cover so that it looks

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
like I did it because he was the guy

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
that he killed with Nicole Brown

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
and so they published the book and they

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
changed it so that I did it and if

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
it's really small yeah

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
isn't he's in jail right now though

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
yeah he's in jail because it's so crazy

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
he like went to steal

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
his Heisman trophy and shit back

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
but it was it was it's the craziest

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
story because he gets

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
his friends together and he's going

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
to get some of this stuff back

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
but so you see the hotel

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
footage of him and his friends but they get

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
lost so you see the footage of them

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
like going up and down elevators

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
like going here and then coming back

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
it's like Keystone cops

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
and then it's it's it's such

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
a great documentary you would love

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
it and that that stuff is

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
in at the end like him getting arrested

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
yeah because nobody knows what he I

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
didn't know what he did after he got

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
acquitted and before he got arrested for this

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
thing like he was releasing rap

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
albums and shit while doing

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
cocaine in Vegas like there's like rap

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
videos of him like dancing

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
with girls and it's amazing

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
if you go to the if you ever do a gig

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
in Vegas there's a restaurant called the

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Golden Steer it's like a it's like a

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
famous old steak restaurant where like

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
John Wayne's like Winchester rifles are

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
up there and there's the Sinatra booth

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
and the Natalie Wood booth and the

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Joey Bishop booth it's great did you

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
just yep Natalie Wood

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
fan in the crowd

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Dave Kline lives two things

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
freestyle rap and Natalie Wood

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
but there is a table

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
if you want to you it's called the

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Last Supper table as if you have a big group

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
there's a table in the middle

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
of the room and that's where OJ

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
had his last dinner before he turned himself

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
in for the go to jail for the

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
the kidnapping

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
break-in thing that he did. You're still

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
the juice juice

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
listen to me

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
you're still the juice

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
juice

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
hey have you been to that steakhouse

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
and

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
if you've been

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
to that steakhouse in Vegas

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
that's got all the like

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
sad cow paintings all over the wall

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
looks kind of like John Wayne

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Gacy painted a

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
it's the creepiest fucking place

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
amazing steak but like it's like

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
when you're

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
they boast the saddest cows

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
but no they have that

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
special like Wagyu beef

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
where they like they rub

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
soap into the cows for a year

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
soap?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
nice flavors

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
they rub soap into the cows

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
they do something I don't remember what

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
they do

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
they massage it and they feed it beer

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
so it's like perfectly marbled

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
so you get this marbled cow

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
but I swear to god I was sitting in there eating

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
and all of a sudden

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
the music it was like

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
they were playing the sound of cows being

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
slaughtered

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
yeah for real

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
like I

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
what does that sound like

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
just like dying animal sounds

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
like underneath it all

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
like you get the feeling

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
they actually hate cows

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
they hate cows you get that feeling

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
the guy who started the restaurant

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
his mom was trampled by cows

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
or something and then he just

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
this is a cow

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
genocides

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
he's like I'm gonna open a restaurant

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
first of all make sure it's the best

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
steak you can get

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
otherwise nobody's gonna come in here

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
it's just an extra fuck you

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
it's like plus you're delicious

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
they show you the picture of the

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
cow dying slowly

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
being beaten with a shoe

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
it's worse it's just

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
it's the pictures are depressed looking

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
cows they're like

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
it's like they know something's not quite

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
right in the paintings

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
you know when the guy comes to make a painting of you

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
days are numbered

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
like oh fuck

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
you got the easel out

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
the cows have to sit for a sad portrait while they're on death row

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
yeah drinking beer

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
while someone's rubbing soap in them

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
why is it soap

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I'm more concerned about the soapy

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I don't know if the soap is real

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
slaughterhouse oil painters

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
it's the saddest job

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
that's a bad gig but they make a lot of money

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
let me ask you guys this

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Duncan and I were talking about this

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
on his podcast I was just his

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
200th guest and

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
at one point we

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
briefly and we both agreed at the time

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
but now I'd like to open it up to the panel

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
if you were

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
going to get eaten by cannibals

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
like let's say

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
let's just

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
let's just centralize it

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
and say it's like traditional

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
like movie

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
no not vampire

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
please jesus no

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I'm trying to ground it

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
cannibals are technically a form of vampire

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
and do like an 80's

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
where it's like you're

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
in a jungle and you've been caught

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
by an indigenous tribe of people that eat human flesh

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
and so you are to them

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
you're

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
you're prey and you're

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
you're getting like prepared to be

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
cooked and you're going to get

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
eaten do you

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
want them to enjoy you

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
if they paint me as an oil painting beforehand

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
you know that cannibals don't eat comedians

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
you know why

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
oh god what is this

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
because they taste funny

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
oh god

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
you're allowed to buy guns now

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
by Obama's law

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
you could be a shooter

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
that was so not funny

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I might kill everybody

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
you're back on the watch list

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
since you asked that question

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
why don't you open the bid

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
you know I originally when we were sitting down

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
we were in the middle of a larger screen

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
about like yeah once you can't do anything about it

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
but like yeah well let me

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
I'm thinking about it like because I'm trying to think

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
like

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
so I'm picturing like

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
okay so I'm long gone

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
and then they're like

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
they're talking about work and stuff

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
and then like they're eating me

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
wait wait wait what are they

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
how are they are you a hamburger

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I'm picturing like a glass

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
dish like you would serve all gratin

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
or

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
sophisticated cannibals by the way

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
it was just like I'm trying to

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
just because I'm just trying to create like

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
these cannibals have glassware

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
it's like Logan's fucking run

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
blowing glass and eating humans

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
it's my two favorite things

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
blowing glass and eating that

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
because I'm trying to make it as much as possible

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
like it's just people are eating

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
oh just a palatable

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
I'm just trying to remove all any kind

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
of extraneous like things so that's why

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I'm going with like a weird cartoonish

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
like tribe of cannibals because they're like

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
oh there's like this mythical people that

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
eat people and that's for them it's ever it's just

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
it's just Wednesday and then

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
and then because and then I don't want

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
to get into like trying to like write

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
like all the like coconut

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Robinson Crusoe technology

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
that they'd used to eat me so I'm just picturing like

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
my my relatives

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
like Easter or something and just like a

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
banquet table and then there's like

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
so there's like chunks of me and like

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
macaroni and like

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
there's like my head with an apple

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
in it and like

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
just like like much shavings

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000

it doesn't matter so like

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
but then so then one of these guys is like

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
yeah well you gotta

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
you gotta worry about that because if you don't

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
then that'll get you and then they

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
and then they're like fuck

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
this is so good

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
you want that

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I don't know I'm picturing that and I'm like

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
is that what I want is that what I want to think

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
about as I'm dying is like they're like

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
have you tried the that

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
the

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
the pink stuff and they go like

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
shit man that is fucking good is there

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
anymore of that like I don't know and they're like

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
high five in each other I don't know

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
but then I'm

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
picturing the other thing where they're like

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
yeah I don't like that I don't like that

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
which one do you like which one do you want

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I don't know I don't know

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I want them to like me you don't want the last

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
thing to be a rejection like

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
he's fucking disgust

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
you want to it's nice you want to feel

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
not that you're gonna be aware of it but

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
you want to be like it becomes easy

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
once you've accepted that you're gonna get eaten

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
but it's like right now sitting here

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I'm in a more resistant state so I'm

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
like so I'm thinking about it more like

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
no I hope they choke on it like like

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
because somehow maybe if they choke

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
hard enough they won't be eating me God

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
I don't want to get eaten like it's like forcing

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
you into a realm where you have to already

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
accept at the beginning of the scenario that

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
you're dead and you're being eaten

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
well that you know that I think we started

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
talking about that because

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
we um I saw this uh

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Naked Afraid episode where

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
this guy

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
this hippie guy like throws a rock at a

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
a jungle chicken

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
and he and he takes jungle chicken

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
yeah that is beautiful

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
there are jungle chickens

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
there is a chicken in the jungle

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
there was a chicken

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I'm pretty sure are there like little baby kitty cats

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
it was like a

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
it was a chicken in the Amazon

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
and he I think it was a chicken

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
there was a chicken in there

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
there ain't no jungle chicken

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
it was a bird

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I think he means a velociraptor

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
I

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
I'm pretty sure it was a chicken

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
maybe the show is planting easy to hunt

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
animals

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
jungle chicken

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
but he

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
he picks up

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
he picks up the jungle

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
birds and he

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
he's like and it's not he's stunned it

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
it's I think he may be trapped or he threw

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
it and he stunned it

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
he picks it up and he brings it up to his

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
face and he's like

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
I am so sorry I need your life

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
energy right now I need

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
you I need you

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
and then he snaps its neck

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
and I was thinking that's the most

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
fucked up thing because the chicken

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
doesn't speak English

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
and

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
right and then and just

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
it's a lot like that guy in Schindler's

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
list that's like

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
shhhhhh

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
exactly that's it

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
no no no why are you being cute

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
yeah you're eat your if you're gonna eat it

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
it's like this is an HP Lovecraft moment

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
for the chicken it's surrounded

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
by an alien

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
camera crew and suddenly something is

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
like

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
yeah

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
that is satanic man

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
so

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
there's another contrast

58:48.000 --> 58:52.440
with another my favorite episode naked and freighters is like a Mormon dude who

58:52.440 --> 58:58.360
the Mormons like they refuse to like huddle for warmth like that's part of

58:58.360 --> 59:03.520
their thing so if you're if they're doing but that's so many wives if they're

59:03.520 --> 59:07.480
devout they have enough wives for the huddle I think if you're devout

59:07.480 --> 59:10.920
anything I don't know why you're on naked and freight but but but if you're

59:10.920 --> 59:16.400
devout anything but I think this part for my memory this was a and I've seen it

59:16.400 --> 59:22.760
before as a Mormon person who blah blah blah the the the he was he kind of lost

59:22.760 --> 59:28.760
his mind in the heat and he started trying to get this lizard and I'm like

59:28.760 --> 59:32.480
the first day of hunting the lizard he grabbed the lizard by the tail the

59:32.480 --> 59:36.320
lizard kept is that the tiniest fucking lizard this lizard is the size of a

59:36.320 --> 59:42.080
goddamn like your pink like not even your pinky that's like like the like

59:42.080 --> 59:45.920
the and so it's like come out and it would be like on a branch and then he'd

59:45.920 --> 59:49.800
like run at it and it would go in this little hole in there in a rock and then

59:49.800 --> 59:52.960
like what at one point he grabbed it by the tail and he had it and then the tail

59:52.960 --> 59:56.880
came off and he just had the tail oh yeah and then he was he just spent the

59:56.880 --> 01:00:02.320
whole episode going that lizard still in there every day it comes out and it

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:06.080
mocks me and it's all he started losing his mind and the fucking like lizard

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.480
came out at a certain point I think I think he started like banging the rock

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.240
like to drive the lizard out he wasn't even patient it was just like he just

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:18.320
started banging the thing the lizard came out he grabbed it in his hands and

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:27.400
he and he just went yeah and then he and then and then I'm pausing in the

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.400
narrative but then he's just like did this victory victory cry and then lifted

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:37.760
the fist to his face so that the lizard could make eye contact with him and and

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:44.720
with no irony no no poetry no glibness out actual fucking Hemingway level like

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.200
like just me in the lizard like like like he just locked eyes with the lizard

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:56.440
and said you like that you like that you ready for this here it comes and and

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:02.880
bit the lizard's head off and and and and chewed it like like it was a piece of

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:09.920
hubba-bubba was he just just as happy as the live-long day and I like extra not

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:15.080
like there was so there was contrast that was like oh man I get to eat I feel

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:20.280
really bad yeah I'm so sorry this guy did you he wasn't even gonna live off of

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.840
this thing he was more excited about how much suffering the thing had gone

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:31.680
through is it naked during this whole interaction yes and yes that's the dark

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.440
side of religion though that's what happens you're all repressed and you go

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.640
out and you're biting heads off lizards they were they were definitely yeah

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:45.680
they were there I that's a great show I think it's a I think I mean it's a

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.920
great show and those guys who because I looked it up because the queue I was

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.440
wondering how much they get paid to do it so they don't they get nothing to go

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.040
out there for 21 days it's like 4,000 bucks I can't remember you can look at

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:01.640
it up probably whatever the guilt minimum is for a reality show no that's true yeah

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.480
well I know it's not even that because what they say is they say that you've

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.880
won a contest so the way they do they're they're a terrible prize that's what

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.640
they know that that's what's funny is they have this great attorney who like

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:18.920
figured out a way around I guess all the laws about like what if they die on set

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.920
and what is the culpability so the idea is you he's he goes strangers die all

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:29.960
the time yeah what if they were strangers well it's a it's a contest it's a

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.800
contest you want to contest where the reward is you get to spend 21 days in

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.000
an exotic location trying to survive while being filmed by cameras all the

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.560
lizards you can eat yeah but that's a great show that's amazing I heard for I

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.400
heard they that read the red tape didn't work out for that anymore so for the next

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.760
season whatever country you go to they we just declare war on it and

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:58.280
then you they send you over there and you're an enemy combatant oh wow so we

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:10.480
can just it's 9-11 don't clap are you wearing that a hat now

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:16.520
currently yes oh good no but are you like have you I woke up from a nap and

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:23.400
I was in a rush and I okay you pull it off you pull it off I think it's tough

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:30.640
for dudes to pull off non baseball hats I think so but you know Jeff Jeff could

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:37.280
definitely be like a spokes he could be the logo for like a spot spy spy

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:45.040
garage door openers or yeah he's trying to sell you x-ray glasses our dearly

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.000
departed friend Sam Simon I went to his house one time I hit a party and I

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.520
walked in wearing a hat and I had like a it was raining so I like an overcoat on

01:03:53.520 --> 01:04:07.240
and I had a hat like this on and he was what do you inspect our gadget I don't

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:11.160
think it's I think it's more like a it's it's a William Burroughs like you you

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.280
seem like you would you would you might be you might shoot heroin and some yeah

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.760
some but not like the normal like like you know normal like white shooting

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.800
heroin like heroin in a nice beautiful beautiful like opium dyn

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.840
style is the reason why I'm fluent heroin the reason why I would never do

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.080
heroin because I also the same reason why I'd never I've never smoked yeah

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:38.120
why would you never do heroin because I would be I would really I think I'd

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.960
really get into it I think yeah that's the thing of heroin people get into it

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.000
but not I would get addicted to it like I've never smoked a cigarette because I

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.840
think like I mean now I wouldn't do it because I'd like I'm mature but when

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.880
when when you're a teenager and people start smoking I never did it because I

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.800
just thought oh fuck I'm a smoker I would like to have the lighter and the

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.720
tapping of the thing and like a reason to leave of the room and go outside and

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.040
have a cigarette but also if I were a smoker I would probably be fancy about

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:12.760
it and I would like make my I would go to this I have a friend that goes to a

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:17.600
tobacconist in Seattle it has his own like numbered blend of tobacco and they

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.000
make him his own cigarettes like I would be one of those yeah you'd have like a

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.440
metal case and stuff yeah but if I were heroin I would have like an old vintage

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:30.280
1920s set that was used by you know like yeah Greta Garbo's uncle or whatever

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:36.280
like and I would have like fancy like a nice surrender so the reason you don't

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:43.640
want to do heroin is you'd like spend too much money on the accoutrement no I

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.880
wouldn't want to do it because I would die doing heroin but the reason why I

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.400
would get into it is because I would like the toys you'd like the toys yeah

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:59.480
yeah you guys you guys you guys know my cat died whoa my god just to just to

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:24.560
can't I was in Canada I was going from the airport to the hotel and then Steve

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:30.680
Levy called and he was in tears and was he sick I mean other than the I mean

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.760

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.760
because my cat died are you a sociopath okay why is he crying did he have

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:49.120
personal loss look water is leaking from their eyes what is this did you know he

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:56.040
was near the end well she I beg your pardon I mean I had been prepared for

01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:00.920
it forever psychologically because I've had cats that have gone down before and

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:05.960
that's and Fiv was like of indeterminate age but we knew at least 10 and she was

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:10.600
FIV positive and she had a whole slew of lately last couple years she had like

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:16.360
you know when they gave me the big bags of fluid with the big large gauge needle

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:21.880
I was like look I'm you know great I don't like lately here we go like you

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:31.280
know so I was ready and the but she was fine I mean I think that she might have

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.760
had like kind of a kitty Alzheimer's kind of thing going on because towards the

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:41.440
end she she she did she she really stopped caring about the dogs as much

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:45.040
I always felt really bad that the dogs were kind of terrorizing her and like

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.600
towards the end she was sort of like she didn't really care where she was and and

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:53.500
but she had like a weird wiggle to her head that was happening and I kept

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.400
wondering as like she was on thyroid medication I was like I wonder if that's

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.440
like the thyroid medication is like jacking her up a little too much would

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:05.560
take her take her in routinely and she just had a lot of shit going on and I

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:12.960
and so after I left for Canada two weeks ago apparently the cat sitter came

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:20.160
over and she was like meowing in pain and it was like walking funny so she

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:27.200
took her to the vet and welcome to the best podcast ever if you're never more

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:34.200
than a Trump observation away from a dead cat story but but she took she took

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:40.920
her to the vet and she had she had she had pancreatitis and it was in such bad

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:45.360
shape that they started prepping her for an emergency like thing like they were

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.560
gonna like send her to a facility or something like that while they were

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.280
prepping her for surgery she had a stroke yeah Spencer was there oh you

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:58.040
were there I got there yeah she had a stroke and so she was essentially like

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:04.760
I had to like authorize the first I had to verify that's all I could leave you

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.960
was like describing to me the thing and I was like I was like so is the idea that

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:14.520
I'm supposed to get permission like I couldn't I was like I didn't want to

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:18.560
sound like a weird monster you were my idea yeah you're like put it down no

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:25.000
but I couldn't I had to keep verifying it but yeah it seemed like she was she

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.040
had a like a she was like essentially they were keeping her alive and she was

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:34.160
like at the at the door of eternity and I had to like give the okay like to end

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:39.400
it right yeah she probably would have made it anyway but yeah she probably

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:46.560
wouldn't have been horrible I missed you I did she probably was gonna make it

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.400
but good call

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.880
he's doing much better because she probably would have made it but like you

01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:04.560
said $750 cap like he just like revealed some like policy I had about they said

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.720
what they said with the with the insulin it would have been like 758 yeah also

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:14.680
you're in Canada so with the exchange but I felt really guilty about it this

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.360
was interesting to me I was telling my therapist about it and I was expressing

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.960
all this kind of self-loathing about it like like which I would tonight except

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.400
like I think she stepped in and because I was I was like oh man I just hit the

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:31.440
deadbeat dog cat owners jackpot because I always felt really guilty about how

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.760
this she was she and I were like buddies and partners and and I just kind of like

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:40.600
the dogs came into the picture and I got super busy and her last years were not

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:47.520
the same as you know the Benjamin Button 25 year old years with the mattress on

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.280
the floor and she and I just like fucking you know paint in the room and and and

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.400
her coming up with ideas for my screenplays and me letting her hump my

01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:02.080
arm because she wasn't spade yet you know like we had we had peaks with

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.240
that relationship and she traveled with me through several homes and intimate

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.040
others all of whom adored her and everyone that met her loved her and and I

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.920
just felt agonizingly guilty in general because it was like oh she was neglected

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.160
like in her lap you know she just became like like she was a big house and she

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.800
just kind of started hanging out she's like I don't like these dogs and it was

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.720
like I'm busy and I was expressing all that to my therapist and she said yeah

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:35.240
you know sounds like you have a lot of issues about neglect and like your cat

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:40.000
you know has is gonna bring a lot of that stuff up but first and foremost while

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.360
she's still your cat that just died why don't you make sure that you mourn her

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:49.800
because what you're doing right now is actually taking away from that process

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.920
which it was kind of profound to me I was like oh I was like making her death

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.440
about me and making it sad which is like the opposite of a cannibal going like

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:04.840
this is delicious Dan Harmon like you I think that you didn't eat the cat but

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.760
Spencer did say I do have a text from Spencer that says she was a Spencer in

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:15.720
the midst of all this stuff like it was like Spencer like she might die if she

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:20.800
does what do you want to do with the body should I put it in the freezer

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:30.200
were you sad Spencer oh yeah yeah I was all busted up are you being

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:39.840
sarcastic oh no no not at all hardest man to read no it was hard it was this is

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:46.560
really tough I yeah no it was sucked if it was great Dan your assistant Steve

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:50.640
it was more than just let's not diminish him he's an awesome dude all the way

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.440
around but he's such a good assistant he he let me know about that like he

01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:00.320
actually put out that that bat signal I'd like let let your friends know about

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.480
Civ that's pretty amazing yeah the amount of shit that that guy does like that

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:08.400
it's pretty crazy and he was he was so broken up about it and I was like how's

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.720
Dan doing he's like well he's in Canada right now like he didn't like I don't

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.040
know how much he knew about what your grief to Chris Cross I'll make it jump

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:28.360
jump I was just like some Canadian party it's Chris Cross Canadian just the

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.720
first song in my head that seemed like the opposite of what you should be

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.520
listening to after your cat dies that story was so sad it made that man throw

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:46.120
up into a bag oh don't call him out he's fine yeah somebody's barge in the room

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:55.000

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:06.720
Katrina happened he he was like working like he was he like he had stuff going on

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:14.360
he just he's from New Zealand but he was living here and he just picked up shit

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:20.920
told us why I'm gonna fucking go and he went to he will not let me tell the

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.640
story because I can tell it now because now that now he's helping him humanity

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.920
yeah he went there and just he's like I can't watch the news and watch what's

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:37.920
going on here without helping so he goes to New Orleans and he said hey I'm here

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.560
I want to help people and like you can't help people as you work for the Red

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:46.640
Cross there's all this red tape and all this stuff so he commandeered a fucking

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.200
bulldozer or some shit he stole a Red Cross sticker if you hear he looked

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:57.600
right into the construction workers eyes and cast a spell over this is all in

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:03.040
the middle of the night but he actually he had to kickbox very briefly a

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:08.760
werewolf from Amnesty International he was going there because he knows

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:16.040
there's blood banks there but this surrounded them with garlic so it was

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.800
real talk he actually like he actually is a good person that like with that like

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:27.080
sacrifice his own time livelihood and safety and just went out there and said

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.360
like if they're not they're not gonna let me help I'm just gonna pretend I'm

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:37.320
just gonna like go around like the red tape and just like get shit done and he

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:42.640
fucking did it's like it's it's it's amazing why couldn't you save my cat

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:49.880
where was he when my cat was dying that'll be amazing if it came back on

01:16:49.880 --> 01:17:01.960
stage Daniel Gillies everybody Daniel Gillies I was saying cunt on stage at an

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:08.880
amount of fosters oh throwing a beer is not the best idea tap it it's gonna

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:19.920
blow did for those listening Dave Kline just toss Daniel Gillies the largest can

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:28.760
of beer he tossed him a keg of beer my tiny Trump hands couldn't catch it

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:34.720
Daniel how long were you in New Orleans for when you went out to help with the

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:39.840
Katrina stuff on the two weeks two weeks yeah you you you commandeer like you

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:43.520
just you just said you faked credentials and got a bulldozer and started

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:46.720
helping move move debris and shit that sounds so much more heroic than what I

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:52.000
did and and I didn't rescue his cat so I'm a double fucker you heard that but

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.320
but no yeah he was right or it's true that you should have trust me believe me

01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:04.880
the no what ended up happening was I went down there was no I couldn't rent

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:12.240
anything in terms of a vehicle in Louisiana and I and I ended up looking

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.200
around in Mississippi to try and find something like a truck I knew I'd need

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:21.880
something some sort of vehicle if I was gonna be helping people and so I got

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:30.720
this is so quiet and that sounds so name-droppery it's okay to drop the name

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:37.600
Katrina if you help sure it's not Beyonce and you hung out with her you

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:47.760
met Katrina intimately so here it goes here it comes so it's weird he's my

01:18:47.760 --> 01:19:04.280
pal so Ryan Gosling you drop that you drop that Mike like that name

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:11.040
dropping Mike's name that's so cool no that's so cool no but seriously tell us

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:16.000

so cool yeah we're just giving you shit go ahead sorry so you called movie star

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:28.240

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:33.120
which I do I do I just a couple symmetrical hanging out go ahead

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:52.240
symmetrical wait I'm putting a pin in the word symmetrical wait but I don't

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:56.640
we're torturing the guy who if there's an earthquake and there will be soon is

01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:02.600
90% likely to be the one that saves your life so I actually go ahead see

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:08.600
oh sorry so look I was I was watching the stuff on TV and I was getting more

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:14.760
and more bummed out and I ended up I ended up making a call to Ryan and I

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:19.680
said hey should we go we should go and do something about this I'm going to

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:25.120
the airport tonight to try and get to to Mississippi because it's where I can rent

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:30.760
the car because all the vehicles are gone in Louisiana and he said cuz he's

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:34.120
more heroic than I in the story and he was already on his way he's like I'm

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:41.960
already he's like he's like I'm already running there he's obviously driving

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:47.560
obviously yes all of his he'd already packed two tig tops he's running he's

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:53.360
got two suitcases above his head and he's running faster than any man has

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:56.480
ever run if you go down to Katrina with Ryan Gosling and he's not driving

01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:04.240
you're just being an asshole he's just running going right you know I never I

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:10.600
never dreamed that this story would sound as fabricated as it does when I

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:15.960
end up telling it it's just it sounds like total fucking shit amazing and like

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:21.400
what every part of life should be like everyone should do this Spencer I want

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:27.080
to make love to you oh man I'm just so cool don't you already there like this

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:35.560
could be a movie oh my god we want to see it like yeah so he's already on his

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:39.800
way uh-huh and I said I so I said oh that's great because I'm on my way to

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:45.480
the airport I flew down to Mississippi I got I hired a bullshit moving truck and

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:51.160
then I drove to Louisiana and Ryan Ryan was already saying to meet him in

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:55.160
Biloxi and so we went to I went to come meet him in Biloxi but we couldn't get

01:21:55.160 --> 01:22:02.680
past a certain security area so I said that we should steal some some Red Cross

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:07.720
stickers because the Red Cross actually had super were super regulated and kind

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:12.680
of militant about the way that they were approaching everything like the way in

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.880
which they were distributing well you know in wartime they were the Red Swastika

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:23.720
I didn't actually they had to change that no I'm kidding I just don't Google that

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:29.480
it just seems like the kind of thing that you'd alright too soon right so we

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.320
stole what if they thought they could you know what if they thought that was

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.760
enough like oh boy better make that a cross yeah let's take some of these

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:42.080
lines off okay so you guys we work with the Red Cross for a couple of days and

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:46.880
before we stole stickers before I stole the stickers I was getting bummed out

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:50.480
working with the Red Cross I don't want to sound disparaging across on this

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.560
thing that's being filmed and recorded but but but they were being super

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:57.120
regulated about it there were certain hours in the day that you could work and

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:00.840
you could help and it was like sort of ten to four and we were like well we

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:04.800
wanted to sort of go into the heart of things and Biloxi was the most fucked up

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.960
so we ended up stealing some stickers from the Red Cross that we could get

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:15.520
through the security and and we ended up sort of setting up a like a temple

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:20.560
there like a Hindu sort of temple thing there there's a huge sort of Thai

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:25.120
population there actually and then we ended up we met up with some guys who

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:29.880
had bulldozers yes the bulldozers did exist and and and we were sort of

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:35.720
clearing debris from the streets and are you Hindu barely but you are no I'm

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:42.920
not what do you mean you set up a it was a nice refuge you went and he didn't

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:47.320
make one I thought he said that too like holy fuck you and Ryan Gosling built a

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:57.200
Hindu temple wow yeah that's what I thought I was still there today yeah and

01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:01.880
it's one of and it's and it's and it's and it's it's it's raised their their

01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:06.360
city's revenue by 10% it's like a profitable temple it's like a game of

right Ryan Gosling just fucking brought a mariachi band that was his gift to the

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:40.760
party he went to a terrible gift to a party they came out and they stood in

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.720
the balcony and they fucking serenaded us and then they played like four or five

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:47.720
songs and boned out and it was like I asked him like that's the greatest thing

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:53.360
I've ever seen in my life like he's like $300 that's like that's all it costs

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.400

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:08.360
be friends with this guy I am friends with him can I tell you my story

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:17.160
you've been waiting so I was you guys are you guys were first responders at

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:25.800
9-11 yeah this episode is the Ryan guys he called him he called him on 9-11 and

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:35.160
then Ryan was like I've been running since 9 10 no uh when I was uh when I

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:40.600
think when I was in college I went we went to India and we were taking a boat

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.960
down the Ganges River you and Ryan Gosling no this is no just me and a

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.480
friend all right Ryan Gosling comes into the story so we're on the Ganges River

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.880
we're on a boat on the Ganges River and this like you know the Ganges River

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:56.880
there's a lot of death floating down so there's like a cow floating down the

01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.640
river bloated and and birds are riding on its back and I look at my friend I'm

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:07.800
like I just don't think I can handle all this death Ryan Gosling explodes out of

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.880
the cow and he no joke and he looks at he looks at me and he says death is just

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:20.920
a part of the cycle of life that's amazing that's amazing that he is so

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:27.480
cool I so cool how could he hear you how could he hear you from inside a cow

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:36.560
he's Ryan Gosling man I can't get a read on Daniel I don't know if he's gonna

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:46.760
beat us up or that horrible joke to Obama Ryan Gosling dropped from the

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:55.440
sitting it was like that wasn't that bad he he dropped down like in front of

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.400
Obama as Obama walked away and whispered to Obama and Obama came back to

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:09.960
you it's like on second thought given my joke yours wasn't that bad yeah I just

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.080
think that's the coolest thing ever though to imagine that when disasters are

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:22.640
happening there are beautiful famous symmetrical men on the way to help that's

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:32.400
a really cool fucking thing this is Daniel this is your worst nightmare isn't

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:39.280
it I hate this my beard smells beautiful so fuck all of you but what do you I

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:47.720
mean what is that instinct because okay so microcosm of it obviously the so the

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:56.800
guy who was in the audience and then he needed help I was still talking to

01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:01.920
Daniel like he was on stage Daniel was already in action like yeah Duncan and

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.880
I were like making fun of me I'm the least funny person on the male was like

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:17.040
whispering to me don't point him out and you what did you do and then Daniel's

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:23.160
there helping we saved his life do we have an update on our honor on our yeah

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:29.160
Ryan Gosling to the hospital came down in a helicopter yeah on one of those

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:40.880
rope ladders just scooped them up yeah gorgeous lat yeah the guy just called an

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:45.480
uber and it was like Ryan Gosling is coming and then a helicopter shows up

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:52.040
he's somehow piloting and hanging off the ladder but then there's the dark

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:58.080
montage of stories that are like Ryan Gosling lawsuit continues as the woman

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:02.640
he pulled from the burning car asserts he threw out her shoulder news Ryan

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.680
Gosling's a brush with the Interpol agency and it's like it's like this

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:11.240
montage and it's like a fall from grace like there's no more you know we started

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:16.400
to take Ryan Gosling for granted and yeah and then we started fucking shitting

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:19.880
on him and that and then it's like and then it's like and then the end of that

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:24.120
credit sequence is like I like still no word from Ryan Gosling after two years

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:30.760
years years years and then you go to this the Gosling cave or what I mean I

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:35.080
don't want to yeah I don't want to over develop he's doing he's yeah he's doing

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:40.840
push-ups and he's like three thousand okay no I think he would just be sitting

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:46.240
in there like like like when I wouldn't be I mean I mean that would be a sad

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:53.600
moment why would he be doing a three thousandth push-up because I think now

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:58.720
he's ready to go out again oh okay my version we're already at like he's now

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:03.400
gonna go but and you can you put that right after the I mean but it's two

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:10.520
years spend any time yeah you're the writer well I mean he's carving Hindu

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:20.280
deities in this cave and sitting in front of them yeah it's like like sundown

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:26.600
and then he's like he's like he's in a bizarre and he's the finishing he's

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:33.560
going no to show but that show but that to to hop hop tipped it and there's like

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:38.080
like all these people are climbing him and kissing him and he's like a machete

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:45.520
machete much much much much and then he goes back to like this like 1800s like

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:51.920
kind of like British colonial office building where he's a detective but he

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:59.000
plays soccer with some kids on the way back oh yeah no it's like he's like that

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:03.440
kid the kid with the like greasy polo shirt yeah yeah yeah he goes like

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:11.160
gasoline gasoline sir mr. Gosling and he goes like oh no let me show you kick

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:18.440
kick jump kick kick and then hop hop and then but that kid on page 70 what blows

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:24.040
up that's right he notices he's cradling that kid's fucking body going when the

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.720
kid kicks the ball he notices that the kid like he turns and there's like a

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:30.360
weird like scar on the back of a cigar burn on it and he he stores that

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:33.720
information later on he like he finds out there's a guy that loves to burn kids

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:42.560
with cigars and shit like that we were making a fun detective slash

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:49.080
thing he goes home to his office like I said his receptionist is like a money

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:53.280
penny there's kind of a sexual like like like pepper pots kind of like it's

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:57.040
too it's too hot to be sexualized until the end of the movie kind of relationship

01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:01.440
and and she's like what's going on out there he's like I got to come all the

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:05.520
way to Jakarta and there's a kid out there he's got a fucking cigar burn on

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:10.080
the back of his head Ryan he can't save everybody wherever you go it's like

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:15.240
yeah what are the cases a walrus poaching happened on the

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:24.600
the Jakarta walrus poaching trade it's gone on for too long but it's great if

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:29.160
the guy poaching the walrus is the cigar burning man that's easy he doesn't

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:34.720
just poach he burns he burns kids sometimes yeah it's pretty good it's

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:41.760
the way it's a lame villain man how fun would it be to really be part of a

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:48.880
murder mystery on a real train well it depends on what what end of the murder

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:53.440
you're not being the victim or even the person who's responsible for well

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:58.520
figuring it out but just to me I feel like if there's a murder on a train let's

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:03.320
stop that train let's all get off right stop the fucking train let's go first

01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:06.280
stop you stop I think there's I think that the there's trains that need they're

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.440
using that track I don't think you can just stop a train I think well I'd

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.600
prefer to have it stopped in that instance not if you're an oncoming train

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.680
but the closest way the quickest way to get to a place where there's cops and

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:21.840
stuff is to keep the train moving if you stop the train who can get there

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:26.760
because the track is already occupied yeah I get out of there there's there's

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.400
been a murder on a closed but you're in Siberia the train's going through

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:36.880
Siberia it's like a snow piercer oh it's snow piercer yeah oh man it's just

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:40.600
or it's just a train I mean that's like I feel like when the when there's a

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.280
murder mystery on the train and you come into a station because you have to stop

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:48.280
every so often on a train the cops are too they're too visible on the platform

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:51.760
they come looking around they get they give the murderer too much time to

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:55.400
fucking you know he's hiding in the bathroom he's climbing on the roof yeah

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:59.080
who knows what's happening so you know they should make train roofs a little

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:04.280
less easy to walk I was just gonna say that and train doors they should yeah

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.680
you should not be able to walk out of a train door climb up on the roof as an

01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:12.520
option right there's a ladder reading leading to the roof and if all that's

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.160
going to be going on all the time and there's gonna be that many murders and

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:19.280
trains then you got to make those tunnels higher oh yeah so the good guy

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:23.800
yeah no but the good guy knows the duck right yeah but you know there's that

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:31.000
old saying murderers on top of trains aren't the aren't the people that kill

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.400
people the tunnels tunnels kill kill people

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:40.440
don't kill people murderers on top of trains kill kill appeal tunnels kill

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:44.360
people yeah but if you look into those stats a lot of times what you'll find is

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.520
that this the statistical likelihood that the person that gets killed on top of

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:57.760
during a train fight they've studied this it's as you'd expect contrary to what

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:03.440
movies would have you believe half of the time the guy who gets taken out by

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.640
the tunnel is the good guy half of the time if you might as well flip a coin

01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:12.840
assuming a two-man fight on top of a train you know really correct sir good

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:20.640
good job 5050 you've got a math genius the statistic is it's actually very

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:24.840
similar to if you have a weapon it's more likely that you're gonna kill

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:28.200
yourself with a weapon that you're gonna defend yourself with a weapon in the

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:32.240
same way if you're on a train it's more likely that you're going to kill

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:36.720
yourself on the train for sure based on these red the reddit videos if you see

01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:41.160
those where there's a whole there's a whole thing happening and I think it's

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:46.960
in India where these kids hang out the side of the train for it for thrills

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:51.720
so they will like hang themselves outside the train and then there's a whole

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:56.080
genre now of videos of the kid just getting smashed in the holes and you're

01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:04.920
watching these all night I can't get to sleep it's I can't get to sleep I

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:11.960
can't sleep I mean I can't get to sleep unless I see the kid getting

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:18.000
murdered and then I go right out oh man you gotta go to man for 4 Chan plus

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.200
China equals fucking crazy fucking well you know like the guy that invented a

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:26.600
microwave he never wanted one in the house because he realized how he knew

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:30.720
how strong the magnetrons are and how like how bad they are for our bodies

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:37.920
Raymond tunnel what a magnetron magnetron it tells us that we got a

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:43.880
transformer yeah fights Optimus Prime it's not a shot of nemesis to Optimus

01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.800
Prime magnets magnetrons are the business end of a microwave are the

01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:51.480
things that cook your food I think I should be the business end of the

01:37:51.480 --> 01:38:02.800
mic oh shit magnetron no I'm Starscream oh I'm always trying to use that

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:13.880
yeah I would do a better job making ramen Starscream I tired of your

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:20.640
incompetence wait who's that character magnetron magnetron which is why he

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:29.360
doesn't have to sound like Megatron it's cool am I wrong about Megatron one guy

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:35.480
yes one fifty-fifty I bet he's right

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:42.120
magnet that was the most outraged response he said that's how he's right

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:48.120
that he's micro is that the inventor of microwaves back there he sounded like

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:53.640
like like we could make that a guy was virtually dead two seats in front of you

01:38:53.640 --> 01:39:00.560
virtually dead but that's what outrageous you beautiful it was also like

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.520
that 15th time today that someone has gotten that wrong that was the vibe of

01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:11.440
him correcting 15 times someone said magnetron it's not fucking magnetrons

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.400
microwaves the cavity magnetron is a high-powered vacuum tube that generates

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:21.720
microwaves use an interaction of a stream of electric field moving past a

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:28.520
series of cavities hashtag and go fuck yourselves

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:39.320
nobody was on the other side of this issue we just want a clarity you guys

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:44.240
made a fool of me but it's different what if I forget like I something fell on

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:48.080
me right now and I become the Phantom of the Opera like I just I haunt this

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.720
podcast forever while heating up your food you're both right because the

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:58.360
magnetron is the tube that makes the microwave so he was more right because

01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:02.400
the thing that's going around doing the things is the microwaves yeah created by

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:10.560
well a magnet now this is which came first the magnetron of the microwave

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:16.200
who knows well I'm more impressed by Dan Starscream impression that's pretty

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:27.160
good that was beautiful yeah you can you do

01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:45.840
Starscream rap yes Zach you got a beat for it's troubled

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.160
the decepticons

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:10.160
well I'm an airplane but I'm also a robot

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:18.160
fuck you mama so hard she got a blood clot I went to Sabatron I used to mow the lawn but now I fuck you mama so hard I fuck her all day long

01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:27.160
I need to decepticons I fuck you mama so hard I give her an aowat's for fucking me

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:43.160
Starscream I'm flying through the sky I am a Starscream gonna turn into a plane when I'm fighting Autobots

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:51.160
roll out hey I'm Optimus Prime I'm gonna beat you all of the time I have a matrix inside my chest and I'm a truck

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:58.160
I fucked your mama cuz I don't give a fuck I've got a blue head and blue fists but they come on separately

01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:05.160
you can't put them on a list of things you want for Christmas it's 1983 and your dad just pissed in this

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:20.160
freak punch Optimus Prime taking dark memories I got a I got a trailer that transforms into a combat platform

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:29.160
there's a little robot inside how to let your mama's pussy it's wide

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:40.160
take it easy take take take it easy take take it easy oh we should team up yes we should we both hate Megatron

01:42:40.160 --> 01:43:01.160
yes we do what are you guys doing oh it's Megatron oh dance

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:20.160
oh shit iron side is here iron side iron side iron hide iron hide iron hide

I'm gonna do it in a pair of greaves I also do larping give me a second

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:56.160
I'm walking down your lawn and I'm pulling a thread on your mama she's dead she's buried underground under the sprinkler

01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:03.160
dig deeper I found Henry Winkler he's from happy days but I don't know what to do without ways

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:10.160
if it doesn't tell me where to go I can't drive Ryan Gosling started to drive Ryan Gosling

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:35.160
Ryan right in Ryan Gosling right rock-oh-rock roll rock-oh-Rock oh Katrina

01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.160
That beard smells good.

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.160
That's good.

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:49.160
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:55.160
Balloons, how do you inflate them with your breath?

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:56.160
Don't hate them.

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.160
You're going to need them for party.

01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:58.160
Celebrate them.

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:00.160
Put them on a string and let them fly.

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:03.160
Now you debate them whether they're good or bad.

01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:07.160
Is it a balloon that you'd possess or did you ever have the balloon?

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:08.160
Or was it a dream?

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:11.160
Was it all filled with air or would you use steam?

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:16.160
If you do, it might expand and take you all across this glorious land.

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.160
You might land down in a field of corn.

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:21.160
You might get outside and find a prehistoric corn.

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:25.160
You blow a tutu and some engage men and then you go all the way around.

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.160
History again.

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:27.160
You got Stonehenge.

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.160
You got Columbus.

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:32.160
You got Plymouth Rock and I'm going to fuck this.

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:33.160
Pussy.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.160
Okay.

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:35.160
All right.

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.160
All right.

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.160
It's been a good show.

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:38.160
It's been a good show.

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:39.160
Yo.

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:40.160
Yo.

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.160
Yo.

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.160
Yo.

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.160
Yo.

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.160
Yo.

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.160
Yo.

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.160
Yo.

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.160
Yo.

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:48.160
Yo.

01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.160
Well, it's been a good show.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.160
What have we learned?

01:45:50.160 --> 01:46:07.160
Okay.

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.160
All right.

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.160
So.

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:16.160
You came down pretty hard on balloons.

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:20.160
You know, there's a helium shortage.

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:21.160
Have you heard about that?

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.160
Is that true?

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:23.160
It's a big problem.

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:24.160
We should probably close out with that topic.

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.160
Yeah.

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.160
You guys heard about the helium shortage?

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.160
It's going to be bad.

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:28.160
It's terrible.

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:35.160
All computers basically are made with helium and we're just putting them in balloons.

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:38.160
There will be a point when balloons are like, I mean, we'll probably be pretty old.

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:40.160
Wouldn't all the helium just be up higher?

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.160
Yeah.

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.160
That's the problem.

01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:43.160
Why don't we just go up?

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:44.160
Go up.

01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.160
Well, then there's going to be a ladder shortage.

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:54.160
You can't just pull it out of the sky.

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:57.160
Is all the helium living up on the edge of our atmosphere right now?

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.160
A lot of it.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:00.160
Helium is triple bonded hydrogen?

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:03.160
It sure is, Dan.

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.160
No, I don't think so.

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.160
No, it's a zone element.

01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:08.160
It's just, well, what is it?

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.160
It's twice as much.

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.160
Oh, no, it's a zone element.

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.160
What am I?

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.160
It's fucking idiot.

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.160
Yes, of course it's an element.

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.160
Right?

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.160
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.160
It's the second one.

01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:17.160
It's an element.

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:18.160
Helium gas.

01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:19.160
What is hydrogen?

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:20.160
Hydrogen is triple bonded hydrogen.

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:21.160
Hydrogen just fuses.

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:22.160
It becomes helium, right?

01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:23.160
No.

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.160
Helium is its own element.

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:26.160
Yeah, but you have to have, yeah.

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:27.160
We all know so little.

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:31.160
You don't want me in with that.

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:33.160
I didn't know that was a thing.

01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:37.400
When I was doing the improv shows in London, one of the suggestions, like the gets for

01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.160
the scene was, the world is running out of something.

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.160
What is it?

01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:42.160
A bunch of people yelled helium.

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.160
I thought that was just a weird thing.

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.160
No, it's true, man.

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:46.160
It's not funny.

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:48.660
So what happens when we run out of our helium?

01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:49.660
The unicorn's all that.

01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:51.160
We're not going to be able to make computers.

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:56.160
But doesn't the law of conservation of helium say that we're not going to run out of helium

01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:58.660
and it's going to all just be floating up at the edge of the thing?

01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:09.160
They're going to repeal that law.

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:10.660
Are we really running out of helium?

01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:14.660
Yeah, yeah, because it's priced, not what it's worth, because you can just buy a fucking

01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:15.660
balloon.

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:22.660
Like if the world was just, it would cost a lot more to buy a balloon because of how

01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:27.160
much value there is in the amount of computers you can make with that helium balloon.

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.660
What does helium do for computers?

01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:30.160
I think it's just very cold.

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.160
It has something to do with like, I don't know.

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:35.660
It has something to do with liquid helium, this guy says.

01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:36.660
That's probably true.

01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:38.660
I mean, probably just something with electronic stuff.

01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:39.660
It's great.

01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:41.660
You think it's used in coolant systems?

01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:46.660
I think it's just used to make the superconducting ships or something like that.

01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:47.660
Thank you.

01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:51.660
That sounds like bullshit, sir.

01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:52.660
I don't trust it.

01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:55.660
Get out of here with your other vomiting friend.

01:48:55.660 --> 01:49:00.660
Tonight, let's all compress it and circulate it.

01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:02.660
I don't know what you mean.

01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:04.660
Talking about fucking command.

01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:06.660
Compress it and circulate it.

01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:08.660
Got it.

01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:11.660
Where do they get helium?

01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:12.660
Where do we get helium?

01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:15.660
When we mine it from the clouds.

01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:17.660
What about helium?

01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:19.660
What's the other?

01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:20.660
Or clouds.

01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:24.660
Is that right?

01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:26.660
What about helium three?

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:28.660
What's up with helium three?

01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:32.660
Oh, it's the worst.

01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:36.660
Is that right?

01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:38.660
Wow.

01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:45.660
It's a contentious but lethargic crowd tonight.

01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:48.660
We're also fatigued by global events.

01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:51.660
Everyone in LA is going through the motions.

01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:54.660
Someone went, fuck fracking, bro.

01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:56.660
Spencer's kind of tired.

01:49:56.660 --> 01:50:02.660
Spencer, can we do a show maybe next Sunday where you control, but I'm here.

01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:03.660
You wear a suit.

01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:07.660
I'm going to wear a t-shirt, lumberjack shirt and shorts instead of there.

01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:09.660
Yeah!

01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:11.660
Yes.

01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:13.660
Let's do it.

01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:15.660
I will finance this.

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:18.660
He needs to be in your suit with that fucking hat.

01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:21.660
He needs to look like Inspector Gadget.

01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:23.660
I can't believe we haven't done this.

01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:25.660
All right.

01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:27.660
Take a dick out.

01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:29.660
You've got to show it.

01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:31.660
It's so fucking hard.

01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:33.660
Like helium.

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:35.660
You can make X-ray targets out of his dick.

01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:37.660
It's like tungsten.

01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:39.660
I don't know.

01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:41.660
I did random research for a movie.

01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:43.660
I'm doing a re-random.

01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:49.660
So I know that's what you use tungsten for.

01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:51.660
Do it.

01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:53.660
Do it.

01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:55.660
You're going to say no when you're going to...

01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:57.660
No.

01:50:57.660 --> 01:50:59.660
Do your American accent.

01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:01.660
That's horrific.

01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:03.660
You prick.

01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:05.660
What do you want me to say?

01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:07.660
You do it for a living.

01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:09.660
I want you to say...

01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:11.660
I'll be a waiter and I'll come over and...

01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:13.660
Hello, American gentlemen.

01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:15.660
What would you like to eat in this?

01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:17.660
No, this is bullshit.

01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:19.660
You do yours and then I'll do mine.

01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:21.660
American?

01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:23.660
Yeah!

01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:27.660
Well, it's 9.59.

01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:29.660
I'm wondering how to conclude this evening.

01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:31.660
I'm grateful to all of you for sitting through our bullshit.

01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:33.660
Thank you so much.

01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:35.660
We're trying to decide how to conclude.

01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:37.660
And we can.

01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:39.660
Take it away.

01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.660
I lied. I'm not going to do it.

01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:43.660
Damn.

01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:45.660
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:49.660
Kumail Nanjiani.

01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.660
Duncan Trussell. Daniel Gillies.

01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:53.660
Spencer Critten.

01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:55.660
And I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor.

01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:57.660
Thank you all for coming.

01:51:57.660 --> 01:51:59.660
Drive fast.

01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:01.660
Take chances.

01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:03.660
This show brought to you by

01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:05.660
the Ryan Gosling Corporation.

01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:13.660
Did you get any of that?

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:25.660
It's a good show.
