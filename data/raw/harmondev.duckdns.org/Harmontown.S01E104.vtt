{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.440\nIt's real pro shit tonight you guys. I'm so fucking tired. I just got off a plane and oh my god. All right, here we go\n\n00:18.440 --> 00:20.120\nIt's gonna be a good one\n\n00:20.120 --> 00:33.720\nBecause I just don't care here we go\n\n00:33.720 --> 00:39.320\nHello one and all, welcome once again to Nerdmelt Theater, Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California.\n\n00:39.320 --> 00:58.320\nHarmontown is now in session. Fifth Bank, howl. Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:58.320 --> 01:08.320\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Why, why, why, I always ask this, why, why so many of you? What's the deal? Game of Thrones is over.\n\n01:08.320 --> 01:17.320\nIsn't there one more? That was it last time? Yeah, you know I was at a town. No, what was I? I don't fucking know man.\n\n01:17.320 --> 01:26.320\nYeah, get caught up man. Yeah. Really? All right, so movie update. Let's talk about Edge of Tomorrow in a second.\n\n01:26.320 --> 01:39.320\nI went and saw Edge of Tomorrow tonight and but there was a trailer. I've never been more excited about a movie that didn't involve people blowing up.\n\n01:39.320 --> 01:49.320\nRobert Downey Jr. is gonna play Robert DeVall's son in a movie about a lawyer that goes back home and Robert DeVall is, you can see this trailer?\n\n01:49.320 --> 01:58.320\nNo. Every trailer I saw for the last two movies I saw with your Godzilla and Edge of Tomorrow, every trailer was about robots and shit blowing up.\n\n01:58.320 --> 02:05.320\nWhich is my, that's what you need to get a rise out of me but I was like, Robert Downey Jr. is like, ah, he's an asshole and I'm an asshole.\n\n02:05.320 --> 02:12.320\nI get people off. I'm a lawyer and then it's like, ah, your mom passed away or whatever and then he goes back home and it's Robert DeVall's dad.\n\n02:12.320 --> 02:20.320\nAnd his dad's a judge. I'm fucking in man. I hope that's not a shitty movie.\n\n02:20.320 --> 02:25.320\nWhoever wrote that movie, if you got those actors to be in your movie, Robert Downey Jr. played Robert DeVall's son.\n\n02:25.320 --> 02:30.320\nRobert DeVall is my favorite living actor. It's gonna be good. I'm signing up for that.\n\n02:30.320 --> 02:36.320\nBut I was there for Edge of Tomorrow which is fucking awesome. Go see it.\n\n02:36.320 --> 02:43.320\nThe last half hour is like, whatever, apparently we can't fully commit to a time-bending action movie.\n\n02:43.320 --> 02:48.320\nApparently for the last half hour you definitely just have to go, okay, now cut the red wire or the blue wire.\n\n02:48.320 --> 02:52.320\nI'm not spoiling it. There's no bomb in it. I'm just saying.\n\n02:52.320 --> 02:56.320\nBut it's pretty profound, that movie. We're just talking about in the green room.\n\n02:56.320 --> 03:02.320\nI'm very accurate for everyone to say it's Groundhog Day, sci-fi.\n\n03:02.320 --> 03:09.320\nBut the thing that you don't know when you hear that is that I think it's like a sequel to Groundhog Day.\n\n03:09.320 --> 03:15.320\nLike, it picks up. It's the James Cameron, like Ridley Scott made Groundhog Day.\n\n03:15.320 --> 03:20.320\nAnd then this is the James Cameron. This is Groundhog's Days.\n\n03:20.320 --> 03:28.320\nAnd that doesn't mean more Groundhogs and more days. It means something more important than that.\n\n03:28.320 --> 03:33.320\nIt means something more profound about our relationship with time and mortality and stuff.\n\n03:33.320 --> 03:36.320\nIt's actually really, really fucking cool.\n\n03:36.320 --> 03:42.320\nAlso, I was very happy, as I said backstage, it reminded me that I've always liked Tom Cruise.\n\n03:42.320 --> 03:48.320\nHe's a fucking great movie star and he went nuts and he believes in weird boogie boogie boogies.\n\n03:48.320 --> 03:53.320\nBut he's fucking badass in that movie. I like Tom Cruise again.\n\n03:53.320 --> 04:00.320\nWow. Alright, we like Tom Cruise again. Tom Cruise, if you're listening...\n\n04:00.320 --> 04:06.320\nI would say he almost certainly listens to this.\n\n04:06.320 --> 04:11.320\nThis is our record. I don't know, I've come up here with nothing on my notepad, but that's really...\n\n04:11.320 --> 04:15.320\nAs far as me having something on my notepad, I had...\n\n04:15.320 --> 04:25.320\nOh no, it says RSJ as Robert DeVall's son. I'm assuming that means RD.\n\n04:25.320 --> 04:30.320\nThey're adjacent on the keyboard. I'm really excited about that.\n\n04:30.320 --> 04:34.320\nThat's going to be a new on Golden Pond. Father and son shit drives me crazy.\n\n04:34.320 --> 04:37.320\nI fucking love it. The idea of Robert DeVall being...\n\n04:37.320 --> 04:41.320\nHe's a judge, but Robert DeVall... Robert Johnny Jr. is a lawyer. Fuck you.\n\n04:41.320 --> 04:46.320\nThere's no bad... I'm going to die. I can't wait to see this movie.\n\n04:46.320 --> 04:48.320\nThere's no bad Robert DeVall movie for my money either.\n\n04:48.320 --> 04:50.320\nThere's no bad Robert Johnny Jr.\n\n04:50.320 --> 04:52.320\nHe wasn't true grip for fuck's sake man, either.\n\n04:52.320 --> 04:55.320\nRooster! Shut the pieces up here, Rooster!\n\n04:55.320 --> 05:00.320\nThere's only so many mainstream things I approve of. Oxygen, alcohol...\n\n05:00.320 --> 05:03.320\nAnd RSJ.\n\n05:03.320 --> 05:06.320\nAnd Iron Man.\n\n05:06.320 --> 05:09.320\nI wanted to talk a little bit about linguistics. Do you mind?\n\n05:09.320 --> 05:13.320\nI fuck no. I insist.\n\n05:13.320 --> 05:17.320\nI feel like...\n\n05:17.320 --> 05:23.320\nWe got to make Spencer up for this conversation, because I want to catch him off guard and I want to talk about something.\n\n05:23.320 --> 05:26.320\nCan we just have Spencer come out early and just have him be here?\n\n05:26.320 --> 05:29.320\nI think he should come out before us.\n\n05:29.320 --> 05:35.320\nSpencer Crichton.\n\n05:39.320 --> 05:41.320\nYou cool sitting there?\n\n05:41.320 --> 05:43.320\nI got caught in a nail.\n\n05:43.320 --> 05:46.320\nWas it sharp? Did it cut you?\n\n05:46.320 --> 05:48.320\nNo, it was the head.\n\n05:48.320 --> 05:50.320\nPull that nail out. That's really dangerous.\n\n05:50.320 --> 05:53.320\nThe head'll fuck you up.\n\n05:53.320 --> 05:56.320\nNow I'm your king.\n\n05:56.320 --> 05:59.320\nYou said that to the nail?\n\n05:59.320 --> 06:03.320\nNo, he's doing Excalibur. He's a king of a really tiny kingdom.\n\n06:03.320 --> 06:05.320\nWas he talking to us, or is he talking to the nail?\n\n06:05.320 --> 06:06.320\nI think he's saying to all of us.\n\n06:06.320 --> 06:07.320\nHe's our king.\n\n06:07.320 --> 06:10.320\nIt's a sword in the stone kind of mythology going on.\n\n06:10.320 --> 06:13.320\nAnyone who believes it, I'll take it.\n\n06:13.320 --> 06:15.320\nIt's not rule anybody out.\n\n06:15.320 --> 06:17.320\nUnite us, motherfucker.\n\n06:17.320 --> 06:19.320\nDid you really want to talk about linguistics?\n\n06:19.320 --> 06:21.320\nYeah.\n\n06:21.320 --> 06:24.320\nShoot.\n\n06:24.320 --> 06:29.320\nAlright, so, I've never talked to you about this, ever.\n\n06:29.320 --> 06:31.320\nThis is the thing I've noticed.\n\n06:31.320 --> 06:33.320\nShit.\n\n06:33.320 --> 06:37.320\nIt hasn't spread to Jeff, and I don't know who started it.\n\n06:37.320 --> 06:42.320\nI don't know who patient zero of this linguistic thing is.\n\n06:42.320 --> 06:45.320\nFor all I know it started with me, spread to you.\n\n06:45.320 --> 06:48.320\nFor all I know it started with you, spread to me.\n\n06:48.320 --> 06:53.320\nMight have started with Aaron, but I've noticed it with me, you, and Aaron.\n\n06:53.320 --> 06:55.320\nUh-huh.\n\n06:55.320 --> 06:58.320\nStarting sentences with...\n\n06:58.320 --> 07:00.320\nI mean...\n\n07:00.320 --> 07:02.320\nI mean...\n\n07:02.320 --> 07:03.320\nWho started it?\n\n07:03.320 --> 07:04.320\nWho started that?\n\n07:04.320 --> 07:06.320\nThat feels like a Spencerism to me.\n\n07:06.320 --> 07:09.320\nWell, see, he owns it better than us, but...\n\n07:09.320 --> 07:12.320\nI mean, yes, I don't do that.\n\n07:12.320 --> 07:15.320\nThat was ill-fitting shoes.\n\n07:15.320 --> 07:21.320\nOkay, so, do you guys remember episode one of, blah, blah, blah, the sleepy candy near?\n\n07:21.320 --> 07:22.320\nYeah.\n\n07:22.320 --> 07:30.320\nColin, the sleepy candy near, is someone from which I derive a lot of my vocal regularizations.\n\n07:30.320 --> 07:32.320\nRegularizations.\n\n07:32.320 --> 07:39.320\nYeah, such as regularizations.\n\n07:39.320 --> 07:41.320\nThat happens.\n\n07:41.320 --> 07:45.320\nYeah, but yeah, no, I think that he does that in...\n\n07:45.320 --> 07:48.320\nI don't think I did it too much, but I think that I did it more.\n\n07:48.320 --> 07:50.320\nI think you do it too.\n\n07:50.320 --> 07:51.320\nI do it a ton.\n\n07:51.320 --> 07:52.320\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n07:52.320 --> 07:53.320\nI think that I...\n\n07:53.320 --> 07:55.320\nYou, me, and Aaron.\n\n07:55.320 --> 07:56.320\nThat's all I know.\n\n07:56.320 --> 07:58.320\nMaybe I can picture Spencer saying it.\n\n07:58.320 --> 08:01.320\nI can also definitely say that Aaron says it a lot.\n\n08:01.320 --> 08:04.320\nAnd I, for all I know, Aaron started it.\n\n08:04.320 --> 08:05.320\nI think...\n\n08:05.320 --> 08:06.320\nI got it from her.\n\n08:06.320 --> 08:09.320\nI will spread it to Spencer, but for all I know, also, other way around.\n\n08:09.320 --> 08:10.320\nI have no idea.\n\n08:10.320 --> 08:12.320\nI feel like it's more of an Aaronism, actually.\n\n08:12.320 --> 08:16.320\nBecause I think that predates my memory of her saying that...\n\n08:16.320 --> 08:19.320\nDo you think it's possible, Spencer, when you brought up candy near?\n\n08:19.320 --> 08:21.320\nAre you saying that you got it from him?\n\n08:21.320 --> 08:22.320\nYou know that?\n\n08:22.320 --> 08:24.320\nI mean, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\n08:24.320 --> 08:27.320\nI also wouldn't be surprised if I got it from Aaron.\n\n08:27.320 --> 08:32.320\nI mean, you know, she says it to everybody.\n\n08:32.320 --> 08:34.320\nFor me, I would put the money on Aaron.\n\n08:34.320 --> 08:36.320\nIt sounds like an Aaron thing.\n\n08:36.320 --> 08:37.320\nI mean, but it's not...\n\n08:37.320 --> 08:39.320\nThe interesting thing about language is...\n\n08:39.320 --> 08:41.320\nLike, everybody has these bookends and things.\n\n08:41.320 --> 08:42.320\nPeople say...\n\n08:42.320 --> 08:44.320\nSo, Aaron and I were talking about this,\n\n08:44.320 --> 08:47.320\nand we were talking about the prefix, I mean,\n\n08:47.320 --> 08:49.320\nand then the suffix, though.\n\n08:49.320 --> 08:53.320\nAs in, I mean this, though?\n\n08:53.320 --> 08:58.320\nLike, that's actually a full, like, emotional thing.\n\n08:58.320 --> 09:00.320\nLike, you could point at a fire hydrant and go,\n\n09:00.320 --> 09:02.320\nI mean this, though?\n\n09:02.320 --> 09:05.320\nBut the interesting thing is there's nothing in that sentence\n\n09:05.320 --> 09:08.320\nthat actually syntactically conveys any information.\n\n09:08.320 --> 09:10.320\nBut everything that you're...\n\n09:10.320 --> 09:13.320\nThe way you're saying it, I mean this, though?\n\n09:13.320 --> 09:16.320\nThe though takes away the meaning in it.\n\n09:16.320 --> 09:20.320\nSo you've just subtracted the I mean from it by saying, though.\n\n09:20.320 --> 09:22.320\nHaven't you kind of sort of like...\n\n09:22.320 --> 09:26.320\nI'm not committing to this, am I?\n\n09:26.320 --> 09:28.320\nI'm not sure about that.\n\n09:28.320 --> 09:29.320\nI don't know if my brain's moving fast enough to know\n\n09:29.320 --> 09:31.320\nif I agree with that.\n\n09:31.320 --> 09:33.320\nI think what's interesting is that I mean is, like,\n\n09:33.320 --> 09:34.320\none of many things where you go,\n\n09:34.320 --> 09:37.320\nlook, listen, hey, at the end of the day,\n\n09:37.320 --> 09:40.320\nhey, well, at the end of the day.\n\n09:40.320 --> 09:43.320\nSome of the stuff we hate, because we notice it,\n\n09:43.320 --> 09:46.320\nbut we all...\n\n09:46.320 --> 09:48.320\nIf there's anybody here who doesn't use those things,\n\n09:48.320 --> 09:49.320\ngreat on them.\n\n09:49.320 --> 09:53.320\nBut I think that also the interesting thing is that...\n\n09:53.320 --> 09:57.320\nI say I mean a lot, and I actually, like,\n\n09:57.320 --> 10:00.320\nI'm looking back at the last six months or a year of going,\n\n10:00.320 --> 10:04.320\nI mean, and I actually, like, I kind of feel the way about it\n\n10:04.320 --> 10:06.320\nlike I do about Instagram.\n\n10:06.320 --> 10:10.320\nLike, I'm like, ah, yeah, I feel like actually\n\n10:10.320 --> 10:14.320\nit's bringing me closer to people.\n\n10:14.320 --> 10:18.320\nI feel like if I didn't have that canopy over my sidewalk,\n\n10:18.320 --> 10:22.320\ncafe, that the sun would be harsher.\n\n10:22.320 --> 10:26.320\nI got like, I mean, because that doesn't hurt anybody.\n\n10:26.320 --> 10:28.320\nI mean...\n\n10:28.320 --> 10:30.320\nMy dad says, my dad has a tick,\n\n10:30.320 --> 10:32.320\nI think all that is is just a time stalling the tick.\n\n10:32.320 --> 10:34.320\nI mean, lots of people have that.\n\n10:34.320 --> 10:37.320\nWell, I think it's more than that.\n\n10:37.320 --> 10:38.320\nI think it's more than time stalling.\n\n10:38.320 --> 10:40.320\nUm is a time stall.\n\n10:40.320 --> 10:42.320\nThe way you feel that time.\n\n10:42.320 --> 10:43.320\nIf you don't mean it, then don't say it.\n\n10:43.320 --> 10:44.320\nLike, I mean, so you're saying it,\n\n10:44.320 --> 10:46.320\nyou're like, you mean everything you say,\n\n10:46.320 --> 10:48.320\nwhether you mean it or not.\n\n10:48.320 --> 10:53.320\nAnd, like, I think saying I mean is like,\n\n10:53.320 --> 10:57.320\nit's a nonce, it's not an answer.\n\n10:57.320 --> 10:58.320\nWell, you're in this space,\n\n10:58.320 --> 11:01.320\nyou're saying, you're implying that, like,\n\n11:01.320 --> 11:05.320\nI just said like, like, I shouldn't have said like.\n\n11:05.320 --> 11:08.320\nI say like, like, like, like, like, like too.\n\n11:08.320 --> 11:09.320\nI stutter like all the time.\n\n11:09.320 --> 11:11.320\nI definitely think the same way it's like,\n\n11:11.320 --> 11:13.320\nit's good for all of us to do sit-ups.\n\n11:13.320 --> 11:14.320\nWhat could it hurt?\n\n11:14.320 --> 11:15.320\nRight.\n\n11:15.320 --> 11:18.320\nUm, the I mean, which is like,\n\n11:18.320 --> 11:20.320\nlike grabbing your belly and like going,\n\n11:20.320 --> 11:22.320\nthis is me, this is like,\n\n11:22.320 --> 11:24.320\nit's like we're dripping into each other.\n\n11:24.320 --> 11:26.320\nThe way we talk to each other,\n\n11:26.320 --> 11:28.320\nI mean, you know what I mean though?\n\n11:28.320 --> 11:30.320\nIt's like, it's a shortened version of,\n\n11:30.320 --> 11:33.320\nverily I say unto thee.\n\n11:33.320 --> 11:35.320\nIt's very interesting to me.\n\n11:35.320 --> 11:37.320\nI remember reading something that,\n\n11:37.320 --> 11:39.320\nit's like, what does that mean?\n\n11:39.320 --> 11:40.320\nI remember reading something.\n\n11:40.320 --> 11:41.320\nThat's another one.\n\n11:41.320 --> 11:42.320\nI was like, what the fuck does that mean?\n\n11:42.320 --> 11:43.320\nYeah.\n\n11:43.320 --> 11:45.320\nAll that means is that I,\n\n11:45.320 --> 11:47.320\nI'm just reminding you that I,\n\n11:47.320 --> 11:49.320\nthe last, since the last time you saw me,\n\n11:49.320 --> 11:51.320\nI haven't been just standing here like C3PO shut down.\n\n11:51.320 --> 11:54.320\nI went off, I read maybe a Newsweek article\n\n11:54.320 --> 11:57.320\nthat someone tweeted me, maybe.\n\n11:57.320 --> 12:00.320\nAnd we don't know if that guy's information was researched,\n\n12:00.320 --> 12:03.320\nbut I remember reading somewhere\n\n12:03.320 --> 12:05.320\nabout communication.\n\n12:05.320 --> 12:10.320\nIt's so incredibly tiny,\n\n12:10.320 --> 12:13.320\nthe fraction of what we say to each other is syntactical.\n\n12:13.320 --> 12:15.320\nThe actual words that we say,\n\n12:15.320 --> 12:17.320\nthey mean so little.\n\n12:17.320 --> 12:19.320\nObviously it's vital.\n\n12:19.320 --> 12:22.320\nThere's absolutely no way to communicate with each other\n\n12:22.320 --> 12:26.320\nwithout, there's this bed of the words we say.\n\n12:26.320 --> 12:28.320\nBut the words we say,\n\n12:28.320 --> 12:31.320\nthere's a way I could say the word fire hydrant to you\n\n12:31.320 --> 12:34.320\nthat would make you understand that I don't like you,\n\n12:34.320 --> 12:37.320\nthat I've had it with you.\n\n12:37.320 --> 12:39.320\nI want to know what that is.\n\n12:39.320 --> 12:41.320\nI don't like the way you said fire hydrant.\n\n12:41.320 --> 12:43.320\nAnd it'd be like, what?\n\n12:43.320 --> 12:44.320\nIt just said fire hydrant.\n\n12:44.320 --> 12:46.320\nAnd it's like, come on.\n\n12:46.320 --> 12:48.320\nWhen we enter into relationships with each other,\n\n12:48.320 --> 12:50.320\nwe drip into each other.\n\n12:50.320 --> 12:51.320\nWe're still amoeba.\n\n12:51.320 --> 12:53.320\nWe're still just multicellular organisms\n\n12:53.320 --> 12:55.320\nand we vibrate air around us,\n\n12:55.320 --> 12:58.320\nbut that is so interesting to me.\n\n12:58.320 --> 13:01.320\nWe have these little canopies and flaps\n\n13:01.320 --> 13:03.320\nand spoilers on everything that we do.\n\n13:03.320 --> 13:05.320\nWell, the English language is very different\n\n13:05.320 --> 13:06.320\nthan other languages, too.\n\n13:06.320 --> 13:08.320\nWe have a lot of words for one thing,\n\n13:08.320 --> 13:12.320\nand Italians say there's one word that means tons of things.\n\n13:12.320 --> 13:15.320\nI was reading this book today,\n\n13:15.320 --> 13:18.320\nand I actually was reading a book today.\n\n13:18.320 --> 13:22.320\nThis is a woman writing a letter to a German\n\n13:22.320 --> 13:25.320\nin World War II, I'm still reading those World War II\n\n13:25.320 --> 13:28.320\ndetective novels, which are the best by Philip Kerr.\n\n13:28.320 --> 13:32.320\nAnd she says, I hope this letter's making sense.\n\n13:32.320 --> 13:34.320\nMy German's not that great.\n\n13:34.320 --> 13:37.320\nEmperor Charles V said,\n\n13:37.320 --> 13:43.320\nI speak Spanish to God, Italian to women,\n\n13:43.320 --> 13:46.320\nFrench to men, and German to my horse.\n\n13:46.320 --> 13:50.320\nYou are the horse to fucking run.\n\n13:50.320 --> 13:53.320\nThat's a really interesting thing.\n\n13:53.320 --> 13:56.320\nThe idea that language is never meant to be\n\n13:56.320 --> 13:59.320\none channel or another.\n\n13:59.320 --> 14:03.320\nThat was your takeaway?\n\n14:03.320 --> 14:05.320\nWas that your actual takeaway?\n\n14:05.320 --> 14:07.320\nI think her point was that she's making fun of him\n\n14:07.320 --> 14:09.320\nfor being German, they're very strident, they're very direct.\n\n14:09.320 --> 14:11.320\nAnd she's saying, I'm from America.\n\n14:11.320 --> 14:16.320\nThey'd hate you over here because you're so cynical\n\n14:16.320 --> 14:19.320\nand so direct, and things have one meaning.\n\n14:19.320 --> 14:23.320\nIn American English, things have all sorts of intonations\n\n14:23.320 --> 14:26.320\nand subtexts and things like that.\n\n14:26.320 --> 14:28.320\nI just thought it meant that like,\n\n14:28.320 --> 14:33.320\nGerman's so shitty that horses speak it.\n\n14:33.320 --> 14:37.320\nIf I was a horse, if I were a horse, to use a subjunctive,\n\n14:37.320 --> 14:41.320\nif I were a horse and someone tried to get me to run\n\n14:41.320 --> 14:44.320\nin Italian, I'd be like, I don't know if I could take a nap.\n\n14:44.320 --> 14:46.320\nHey, a little horse.\n\n14:46.320 --> 14:49.320\nHe'd be like, I don't know, what do I do?\n\n14:49.320 --> 14:53.320\nYou will stay and they're going to say,\n\n14:53.320 --> 14:55.320\nI'm a German.\n\n14:55.320 --> 14:57.320\nThat sounds like, get the fuck going.\n\n14:57.320 --> 15:02.320\nI'm just spreading white on white racism right now.\n\n15:02.320 --> 15:07.320\nSpeaking of which, let's do a World Cup Sports Corner.\n\n15:07.320 --> 15:19.320\nDan?\n\n15:19.320 --> 15:21.320\nThe World Cup, boy.\n\n15:21.320 --> 15:23.320\nWhat a World Cup.\n\n15:23.320 --> 15:26.320\nI'll start just by saying, Dan, that I was on the road\n\n15:26.320 --> 15:28.320\nthis last weekend with the Who's Line boys\n\n15:28.320 --> 15:30.320\nand we had these big tour bus rides.\n\n15:30.320 --> 15:32.320\nWe watched every minute of the World Cups.\n\n15:32.320 --> 15:36.320\nThat cup was extra, worldly.\n\n15:36.320 --> 15:39.320\nToday, Dan, I'm sure like all Americans,\n\n15:39.320 --> 15:41.320\nyou have strong feelings about USA Portugal.\n\n15:41.320 --> 15:43.320\nI know that the United States was involved\n\n15:43.320 --> 15:46.320\nin the World Cup today, everyone knows it.\n\n15:46.320 --> 15:49.320\nThat's part of what makes it extra more important\n\n15:49.320 --> 15:53.320\nthan the already totally important World Cup,\n\n15:53.320 --> 15:58.320\nis that America was part of the World Cup today.\n\n15:58.320 --> 16:01.320\nI know, I know.\n\n16:01.320 --> 16:03.320\nDo you think they're going to make it out of the group stage?\n\n16:03.320 --> 16:05.320\nThey're not done?\n\n16:05.320 --> 16:07.320\nNo.\n\n16:07.320 --> 16:09.320\nI think that America today...\n\n16:09.320 --> 16:11.320\nDoes anybody even hear, and I don't imagine the answer\n\n16:11.320 --> 16:13.320\nwill be yes, does anybody hear afraid\n\n16:13.320 --> 16:15.320\nof hearing soccer spoilers today?\n\n16:15.320 --> 16:18.320\nSoccer spoilers.\n\n16:18.320 --> 16:20.320\nI was running scared because I was on a plane\n\n16:20.320 --> 16:23.320\nduring two of the matches and I had to make it home\n\n16:23.320 --> 16:25.320\nand hope that some guy didn't go like,\n\n16:25.320 --> 16:27.320\nwithin it or...\n\n16:27.320 --> 16:29.320\nRight, you don't want to, you come off the plane\n\n16:29.320 --> 16:31.320\nand there's a guy, instead of holding a sign\n\n16:31.320 --> 16:33.320\nthat says Davis, it says,\n\n16:33.320 --> 16:36.320\nthey didn't use their hands.\n\n16:36.320 --> 16:39.320\nAnd you're like, oh shit, fuck.\n\n16:39.320 --> 16:43.320\nYeah, so today was a big day\n\n16:43.320 --> 16:45.320\nin World Cup football,\n\n16:45.320 --> 16:48.320\nwhat they call football history.\n\n16:48.320 --> 16:50.320\nI think that how many more games to go?\n\n16:50.320 --> 16:52.320\nTwo, three, five?\n\n16:52.320 --> 16:54.320\nThey're in the group stage, they have to play Germany,\n\n16:54.320 --> 16:56.320\na draw gets them through.\n\n16:56.320 --> 16:59.320\nThis is a big deal, so the U.S. won, of course.\n\n16:59.320 --> 17:01.320\nNo.\n\n17:01.320 --> 17:03.320\nIt was a draw today.\n\n17:03.320 --> 17:05.320\nThey were beating Portugal, they've never beaten...\n\n17:05.320 --> 17:07.320\nIt was going to be the best victory of all time\n\n17:07.320 --> 17:10.320\nand they lost it in the last kick of the game.\n\n17:10.320 --> 17:12.320\nIt was a draw in the last kick of the game.\n\n17:12.320 --> 17:14.320\nAnd if they'd won it, they would have been\n\n17:14.320 --> 17:16.320\nadvanced to the knockout stage.\n\n17:16.320 --> 17:18.320\nBut why am I telling you this, Dan?\n\n17:18.320 --> 17:20.320\nYou're the sports...\n\n17:20.320 --> 17:23.320\nSo they did good.\n\n17:23.320 --> 17:26.320\nYeah, they did very, very well.\n\n17:26.320 --> 17:30.320\nShit on the bit a little bit.\n\n17:30.320 --> 17:33.320\nI guess they did okay.\n\n17:33.320 --> 17:35.320\nWhat do you think the...\n\n17:35.320 --> 17:37.320\nWho do you like? Which country do you think has the best...\n\n17:37.320 --> 17:40.320\nUSA.

like, woo!\n\n27:20.320 --> 27:21.320\nAnd then it was like,\n\n27:21.320 --> 27:23.320\nand of course, the titular character,\n\n27:23.320 --> 27:25.320\nDan Hyman, and everyone was like,\n\n27:25.320 --> 27:27.320\nhe's fine too, it's fine.\n\n27:29.320 --> 27:31.320\nMaybe they were all clapped out from Spencer.\n\n27:31.320 --> 27:32.320\nThey were!\n\n27:32.320 --> 27:33.320\nYes, they were!\n\n27:33.320 --> 27:35.320\nYes, their hands were bleeding!\n\n27:36.320 --> 27:37.320\nAnd I don't...\n\n27:37.320 --> 27:39.320\nHave you ever been torn between...\n\n27:39.320 --> 27:41.320\nIt's funny, because I'm 41.\n\n27:41.320 --> 27:43.320\nI should have a son, Spencer's age.\n\n27:45.320 --> 27:47.320\nIf everything had gone correctly,\n\n27:47.320 --> 27:49.320\naccording to the Midwestern tradition,\n\n27:49.320 --> 27:51.320\nI would have you as a son.\n\n27:51.320 --> 27:52.320\nNice.\n\n27:54.320 --> 27:55.320\nAnd...\n\n27:55.320 --> 27:57.320\nThere's still wills to write, I mean.\n\n28:02.320 --> 28:03.320\nSo I kind of...\n\n28:03.320 --> 28:05.320\nYeah, I imagine that's going to be like,\n\n28:05.320 --> 28:07.320\nlike to have a kid, like...\n\n28:07.320 --> 28:11.320\nAh, get that, get that, get that soccer goal.\n\n28:12.320 --> 28:15.320\nWin that potato science fair thing.\n\n28:16.320 --> 28:18.320\nAnd then there must be some other part of you that's like,\n\n28:18.320 --> 28:20.320\nfuck, he did it, he did it.\n\n28:21.320 --> 28:23.320\nAnd then you just go in the attic and just...\n\n28:23.320 --> 28:24.320\nHunter Thompson.\n\n28:27.320 --> 28:28.320\nBecause you're like, what else do I...\n\n28:28.320 --> 28:29.320\nWrite a bunch of wonderful books?\n\n28:29.320 --> 28:30.320\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n28:33.320 --> 28:35.320\nI'm sorry I made it dark, I didn't mean to...\n\n28:35.320 --> 28:37.320\nI didn't mean it.\n\n28:37.320 --> 28:39.320\nIf you guys ever think I would actually kill myself,\n\n28:39.320 --> 28:40.320\nyou're insane.\n\n28:41.320 --> 28:43.320\nI'm so much more petty than that.\n\n28:43.320 --> 28:44.320\nI would never...\n\n28:45.320 --> 28:47.320\nIf anybody's worried about that ever happening,\n\n28:47.320 --> 28:48.320\nthat's...\n\n28:48.320 --> 28:50.320\nWhat if you were in, like, pain, like Hunter S. Thompson?\n\n28:50.320 --> 28:51.320\nIf I'm in pain...\n\n28:51.320 --> 28:53.320\nYeah, if I get a cold, fuck it.\n\n28:56.320 --> 28:58.320\nBut I will go to one doctor, one doctor.\n\n28:58.320 --> 29:00.320\nCan you knock this out?\n\n29:00.320 --> 29:01.320\nAnd if he's like, give it six weeks,\n\n29:01.320 --> 29:05.320\nI'm like, give me five weeks, bang!\n\n29:05.320 --> 29:07.320\nWaiting period, another five...\n\n29:07.320 --> 29:10.320\nIf my leg hurts, yeah, fuck it.\n\n29:10.320 --> 29:11.320\nAlright, so, let's move on.\n\n29:11.320 --> 29:12.320\nThis is depressing.\n\n29:15.320 --> 29:16.320\nI'm gonna pull out...\n\n29:16.320 --> 29:17.320\nI don't think there's anything in here.\n\n29:17.320 --> 29:19.320\nI'm really excited about...\n\n29:19.320 --> 29:21.320\nRobert DeVall playing...\n\n29:22.320 --> 29:24.320\nRobert Johnny Jr.'s dad.\n\n29:24.320 --> 29:25.320\nWorld Cup.\n\n29:26.320 --> 29:27.320\nI'm gonna be honest with you,\n\n29:27.320 --> 29:29.320\nthat was just part of that whole linguistic thing.\n\n29:29.320 --> 29:31.320\nLike, some people say, Aaron was saying that,\n\n29:31.320 --> 29:32.320\nI was talking about that with her,\n\n29:32.320 --> 29:33.320\nit's just like, people say,\n\n29:33.320 --> 29:34.320\nHonestly?\n\n29:34.320 --> 29:35.320\nOr they go like,\n\n29:35.320 --> 29:36.320\nI'm gonna be honest with you.\n\n29:36.320 --> 29:37.320\nYeah.\n\n29:37.320 --> 29:38.320\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n29:38.320 --> 29:40.320\nLike, we're gonna get beyond the whole idea of like,\n\n29:40.320 --> 29:42.320\noh, I hate that, we should never do that and stuff.\n\n29:42.320 --> 29:44.320\nIt's just something that we do.\n\n29:44.320 --> 29:45.320\nSometimes we do it.\n\n29:45.320 --> 29:47.320\nThere's people out here who have abused that,\n\n29:47.320 --> 29:48.320\nthere's people who...\n\n29:48.320 --> 29:50.320\nI have used the phrase,\n\n29:50.320 --> 29:52.320\nI'm gonna be honest with you,\n\n29:52.320 --> 29:54.320\ntwo wonderful effects.\n\n29:56.320 --> 29:58.320\nI'll give you an example.\n\n29:58.320 --> 30:00.320\nNo, there's no example.\n\n30:00.320 --> 30:01.320\nI'm just saying like,\n\n30:01.320 --> 30:03.320\nit's not about being a good or bad person.\n\n30:03.320 --> 30:06.320\nSomebody tweeted me a link, Jeff.\n\n30:06.320 --> 30:08.320\nSomebody tweeted me a link.\n\n30:09.320 --> 30:11.320\nWhat was that link?\n\n30:13.320 --> 30:15.320\nTo this guy that does his thing,\n\n30:15.320 --> 30:17.320\nit's called, what the hell is it called?\n\n30:17.320 --> 30:19.320\nSurveillance cameraman?\n\n30:19.320 --> 30:21.320\nDoes anybody know what I'm talking about?\n\n30:21.320 --> 30:24.320\nThe man who deals with surveillance cameras.\n\n30:24.320 --> 30:26.320\nIt's a guy who takes a camera, a kid,\n\n30:26.320 --> 30:28.320\nmaybe I should call him, I don't know what to call him.\n\n30:28.320 --> 30:31.320\nTakes a camera and he just,\n\n30:31.320 --> 30:33.320\nnow dismiss all your notions of like,\n\n30:33.320 --> 30:35.320\ngood person, bad person, you know,\n\n30:35.320 --> 30:37.320\njust assume he's a bad person.\n\n30:37.320 --> 30:39.320\nIt sounds like he is.\n\n30:39.320 --> 30:41.320\nHe just takes a camera and he just\n\n30:41.320 --> 30:43.320\ngoes up and gets in people's faces.\n\n30:43.320 --> 30:45.320\nHe just stands there with the camera.\n\n30:45.320 --> 30:46.320\nThat's what he does.\n\n30:46.320 --> 30:47.320\nPeople can see the camera as a hidden camera?\n\n30:47.320 --> 30:49.320\nYeah, no, they can see it.\n\n30:49.320 --> 30:51.320\nAnd then they, so it's just,\n\n30:51.320 --> 30:53.320\nand then it's a montage of people\n\n30:53.320 --> 30:56.320\nlooking and going, what are you doing?\n\n30:58.320 --> 30:59.320\nStop it.\n\n30:59.320 --> 31:03.320\nAnd then it splinters off into all of this behavior,\n\n31:03.320 --> 31:05.320\nnone of which is good or bad,\n\n31:05.320 --> 31:06.320\nall of which is fascinating.\n\n31:06.320 --> 31:08.320\nIs he provoking them with questions or things?\n\n31:08.320 --> 31:11.320\nNo, he turns the, this kid has,\n\n31:11.320 --> 31:13.320\nI mean, I think this kid is just going through\n\n31:13.320 --> 31:14.320\na phase that we all went through,\n\n31:14.320 --> 31:16.320\nbut he has access to more technology\n\n31:16.320 --> 31:17.320\nthan we had when we were this age,\n\n31:17.320 --> 31:18.320\nbecause kids age.\n\n31:18.320 --> 31:20.320\nThat's my assumption, but don't,\n\n31:20.320 --> 31:22.320\nI don't know, he could be 48 years old.\n\n31:22.320 --> 31:27.320\nLike, what matters is that this kid has effectively,\n\n31:27.320 --> 31:30.320\nlike, regardless of what he's doing,\n\n31:30.320 --> 31:34.320\nthe end result of what you're watching\n\n31:34.320 --> 31:36.320\nis that you're getting to see humanity\n\n31:36.320 --> 31:38.320\nas if you're a scuba diver\n\n31:38.320 --> 31:41.320\noutside a coral reef.\n\n31:41.320 --> 31:44.320\nAnd so there's fish that gather around you\n\n31:44.320 --> 31:46.320\nand are angry at you,\n\n31:46.320 --> 31:47.320\nbecause they're gathered around you.\n\n31:47.320 --> 31:48.320\nThere's fish that, of course,\n\n31:48.320 --> 31:49.320\ndart the other way.\n\n31:49.320 --> 31:52.320\nThere's fish that come at you\n\n31:52.320 --> 31:53.320\nand circle you for a second\n\n31:53.320 --> 31:54.320\nand then dart at you\n\n31:54.320 --> 31:56.320\nand try to get your mask off.\n\n31:56.320 --> 31:59.320\nThere's fish that, and everything in between.\n\n31:59.320 --> 32:03.320\nThis guy, like, will open the back door\n\n32:03.320 --> 32:07.320\nof a Burger King and walk into the kitchen.\n\n32:07.320 --> 32:11.320\nAnd it's just a POV of walking through\n\n32:11.320 --> 32:15.320\na fucking Burger King back in the kitchen\n\n32:15.320 --> 32:17.320\nwith eight people cutting lettuce,\n\n32:17.320 --> 32:19.320\nflipping burgers.\n\n32:19.320 --> 32:20.320\nAnd every person he walks by,\n\n32:20.320 --> 32:21.320\nit's like they're all Brontosaurus\n\n32:21.320 --> 32:22.320\nin Jurassic Park.\n\n32:22.320 --> 32:24.320\nThey all look at him\n\n32:24.320 --> 32:28.320\nand then go back to chopping lettuce.\n\n32:28.320 --> 32:30.320\nAnd then one guy will come up.\n\n32:30.320 --> 32:34.320\nThat's like, excuse me, hello.\n\n32:34.320 --> 32:36.320\nBecause he thinks that when he does that,\n\n32:36.320 --> 32:38.320\nthen that means go away.\n\n32:38.320 --> 32:39.320\nBut then he has to go to the phone.\n\n32:39.320 --> 32:40.320\nEveryone has a different relationship.\n\n32:40.320 --> 32:43.320\nThere's like a camera that goes into a laundromat\n\n32:43.320 --> 32:45.320\nand there's a guy sitting at a table on a laundromat.\n\n32:45.320 --> 32:47.320\nAnd the guy's just sitting at the table on a laundromat\n\n32:47.320 --> 32:50.320\nand he's watching this camera come toward him.\n\n32:50.320 --> 32:52.320\nAnd the camera comes toward him.\n\n32:52.320 --> 32:54.320\nAnd then just as it sits down at the table\n\n32:54.320 --> 32:56.320\nin the laundromat across from him,\n\n32:56.320 --> 32:59.320\nthe guy goes from totally just sitting there\n\n32:59.320 --> 33:01.320\nwatching the camera to flipping out,\n\n33:01.320 --> 33:04.320\nflips the table up into the camera,\n\n33:04.320 --> 33:06.320\ngoes like, what the fuck are you doing?\n\n33:06.320 --> 33:07.320\nGet the fuck out of here.\n\n33:07.320 --> 33:10.320\nAnd starts chasing the guy with a chair.\n\n33:10.320 --> 33:12.320\nAnd all this guy ever does,\n\n33:12.320 --> 33:16.320\nthis guy is not a good person, not a good person.\n\n33:16.320 --> 33:18.320\nIs a scuba diver a good person that goes in\n\n33:18.320 --> 33:21.320\nand looks at the fucking, according to the fish?\n\n33:21.320 --> 33:23.320\nNo, no, not good.\n\n33:23.320 --> 33:24.320\nGet out of there.\n\n33:24.320 --> 33:25.320\nYou shouldn't be there.\n\n33:25.320 --> 33:26.320\nDon't be there.\n\n33:26.320 --> 33:27.320\nI hope it's a kid because that seems like a good\n\n33:27.320 --> 33:30.320\nlike 17, 16 year old kind of instinct.\n\n33:30.320 --> 33:32.320\nIt feels like a phase that we all go through.\n\n33:32.320 --> 33:34.320\nWell, I went through when I was,\n\n33:34.320 --> 33:36.320\nbut the interesting thing about it is like,\n\n33:36.320 --> 33:39.320\nI never, there's a strangely uplifting component to it\n\n33:39.320 --> 33:44.320\nbecause some people are grabbing at the camera\n\n33:44.320 --> 33:48.320\nlike literally just like, smash the guy in the face.\n\n33:48.320 --> 33:50.320\nLike, like, like, like, maybe-\n\n33:50.320 --> 33:51.320\nDoes anybody just like see the camera\n\n33:51.320 --> 33:53.320\nand just start singing Moon River really well?\n\n33:53.320 --> 33:54.320\nThere are.\n\n33:54.320 --> 33:56.320\nThere are some like Ben and Jerry's kind of like old school\n\n33:56.320 --> 33:58.320\nlike guys with big long beards,\n\n33:58.320 --> 34:01.320\nlike Spencer in 30 years.\n\n34:01.320 --> 34:03.320\nI'll give you 30.\n\n34:03.320 --> 34:06.320\nLike some of them just cut to a guy\n\n34:06.320 --> 34:09.320\nin a big long gray beard and he's just staring.\n\n34:09.320 --> 34:11.320\nLike he's waiting for a crosswalk\n\n34:11.320 --> 34:12.320\nand this guy came up to him\n\n34:12.320 --> 34:13.320\nand so it's just cuts to this guy\n\n34:13.320 --> 34:15.320\nthat just stares at the camera\n\n34:15.320 --> 34:17.320\nand he's waiting for something to give\n\n34:17.320 --> 34:20.320\nand then he goes, I don't know, and walks off.\n\n34:20.320 --> 34:24.320\nThere is no heroic or villainous reaction\n\n34:24.320 --> 34:27.320\nto somebody dehumanizing you.\n\n34:27.320 --> 34:29.320\nYou know, there is no,\n\n34:29.320 --> 34:35.320\nbut none of the people who are on this video\n\n34:35.320 --> 34:37.320\nare good or bad people.\n\n34:37.320 --> 34:40.320\nBut the incredibly,\n\n34:40.320 --> 34:42.320\nthe epiphany I had while watching it was,\n\n34:42.320 --> 34:45.320\noh my god, I've just been given permission\n\n34:45.320 --> 34:49.320\nto look at people as if they are animals\n\n34:49.320 --> 34:53.320\nbecause some of them are violent animals\n\n34:53.320 --> 34:57.320\nand some of them are pacifistic animals\n\n34:57.320 --> 35:00.320\nand some of them are herding around him.\n\n35:00.320 --> 35:02.320\nHe'll be like in the middle of a target\n\n35:02.320 --> 35:05.320\nand then it's just people slowly encroaching on him\n\n35:05.320 --> 35:07.320\ngoing, hey, what are you doing?\n\n35:07.320 --> 35:09.320\nHey, what are you doing?\n\n35:09.320 --> 35:12.320\nAnd they're all ganging up on him\n\n35:12.320 --> 35:14.320\nand then one fat guy will come up,\n\n35:14.320 --> 35:16.320\nhey, come on, what are you doing?\n\n35:16.320 --> 35:18.320\nHe's more of an alpha male.\n\n35:18.320 --> 35:20.320\nI can just watch it for hours.\n\n35:20.320 --> 35:21.320\nBut the camera never turns,\n\n35:21.320 --> 35:23.320\nyou never meet this guy, you never see him?\n\n35:23.320 --> 35:25.320\nNo, I think in the early ones,\n\n35:25.320 --> 35:26.320\npeople say, what are you doing\n\n35:26.320 --> 35:28.320\nand you hear the kid's voice go,\n\n35:28.320 --> 35:30.320\nI'm making a video.\n\n35:30.320 --> 35:33.320\nBut I think he drops it.\n\n35:33.320 --> 35:36.320\nHe's Sasha Baron Cohen but without the ego.\n\n35:36.320 --> 35:39.320\nLet's assume this kid is the worst piece of shit in the world.\n\n35:39.320 --> 35:41.320\nLet's assume he's like pre-columbine,\n\n35:41.320 --> 35:43.320\nhe's ready to, you know,\n\n35:43.320 --> 35:46.320\nlet's not pin any medals to his chest.\n\n35:46.320 --> 35:51.320\nBut all I know is that the content\n\n35:51.320 --> 35:53.320\nthat's coming out of the other side,\n\n35:53.320 --> 35:56.320\nI think is art because I am like,\n\n35:56.320 --> 36:01.320\nI've never, I've had to watch people\n\n36:01.320 --> 36:03.320\non YouTube a lot\n\n36:03.320 --> 36:06.320\nand I've never been so fucking fascinated,\n\n36:06.320 --> 36:09.320\nwhich is really interesting.\n\n36:09.320 --> 36:11.320\nAnd all he does is just say nothing\n\n36:11.320 --> 36:13.320\nand just get in people's faces\n\n36:13.320 --> 36:15.320\nand with his camera.\n\n36:15.320 --> 36:17.320\nWhat would your reaction be if somebody woke up to you?\n\n36:17.320 --> 36:18.320\nI don't know.\n\n36:18.320 --> 36:19.320\nI don't know.\n\n36:19.320 --> 36:20.320\nIt might be different.\n\n36:20.320 --> 36:21.320\nIt would be one thing on Tuesday,\n\n36:21.320 --> 36:22.320\none thing on Wednesday.\n\n36:22.320 --> 36:23.320\nLet's paint a picture.\n\n36:23.320 --> 36:28.320\nLet's say that you're,\n\n36:28.320 --> 36:30.320\nwhat do you do?\n\n36:30.320 --> 36:35.320\nYou're standing outside the drawing room on your phone,\n\n36:35.320 --> 36:36.320\nlet's say.\n\n36:36.320 --> 36:39.320\nAm I drunk?\n\n36:39.320 --> 36:40.320\nMidway.\n\n36:40.320 --> 36:41.320\nYou're not drunk yet.\n\n36:41.320 --> 36:42.320\nYou've had a few.\n\n36:42.320 --> 36:43.320\nWho am I talking to on the phone?\n\n36:43.320 --> 36:44.320\nAaron.\n\n36:44.320 --> 36:45.320\nAnd Aaron on the phone?\n\n36:45.320 --> 36:46.320\nAaron's on the phone.\n\n36:46.320 --> 36:47.320\nI mean, he's fine.\n\n36:47.320 --> 36:48.320\nBad mood.\n\n36:48.320 --> 36:49.320\nYeah, and then you just out there\n\n36:49.320 --> 36:52.320\nand then you hang up the phone\n\n36:52.320 --> 36:54.320\nand now you're not talking to anybody.\n\n36:54.320 --> 36:55.320\nNow you're taking the moments,\n\n36:55.320 --> 36:57.320\na nice day out in California\n\n36:57.320 --> 36:59.320\nand you're going through Instagram\n\n36:59.320 --> 37:01.320\nor through tweets or whatever.\n\n37:01.320 --> 37:03.320\nSo now you're just idling out there.\n\n37:03.320 --> 37:04.320\nAnd this person, let's say.\n\n37:04.320 --> 37:06.320\nSo a guy comes up and he gets about,\n\n37:06.320 --> 37:08.320\nthis guy usually gets,\n\n37:08.320 --> 37:09.320\nif he's allowed to,\n\n37:09.320 --> 37:11.320\nhe gets about a foot and a half.\n\n37:11.320 --> 37:12.320\nWow.\n\n37:12.320 --> 37:13.320\nIt's personal space.\n\n37:13.320 --> 37:14.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n37:14.320 --> 37:16.320\nThat's a bubble-burster for most of you.\n\n37:16.320 --> 37:18.320\nYeah, if he didn't have a camera with him,\n\n37:18.320 --> 37:20.320\nit would be weird.\n\n37:20.320 --> 37:22.320\nThe camera makes it less weird.\n\n37:22.320 --> 37:24.320\nI want to stretch over and over and over and over again\n\n37:24.320 --> 37:26.320\nbecause we belong to this culture where it's like,\n\n37:26.320 --> 37:27.320\noh, he's a good person.\n\n37:27.320 --> 37:28.320\nHe's a bad person.\n\n37:28.320 --> 37:30.320\nI don't know if this person could be a whore.\n\n37:30.320 --> 37:31.320\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n37:31.320 --> 37:34.320\nSo this day, you don't have a chip on your shoulders.\n\n37:34.320 --> 37:35.320\nThere's nothing really like that.\n\n37:35.320 --> 37:36.320\nAnd the guy just comes up.\n\n37:36.320 --> 37:37.320\nYeah.\n\n37:37.320 --> 37:40.320\nBut honestly, like, I just got off the phone with Aaron.\n\n37:40.320 --> 37:42.320\nSo I'm outside the drawing room.\n\n37:42.320 --> 37:44.320\nThe camera comes up and I go,\n\n37:44.320 --> 37:45.320\nhello.\n\n37:45.320 --> 37:46.320\nHi.\n\n37:46.320 --> 37:50.320\nHey, so this guy just stands there and doesn't do anything?\n\n37:50.320 --> 37:51.320\nWho are you?\n\n37:51.320 --> 37:53.320\nYeah, this is what often people are doing.\n\n37:53.320 --> 37:55.320\nThey're going, like, hello.\n\n37:55.320 --> 37:56.320\nWhat are you doing?\n\n37:56.320 --> 37:57.320\nWhat are you doing?\n\n37:57.320 --> 38:00.320\nNow, then a bunch of people, some people go,\n\n38:00.320 --> 38:02.320\nand I don't think these people are bad people at all,\n\n38:02.320 --> 38:09.320\nthey go, and they fucking, like, thrust, smack.\n\n38:09.320 --> 38:11.320\nThe camera goes black.\n\n38:11.320 --> 38:13.320\nThey punch him.\n\n38:13.320 --> 38:15.320\nThey grab his camera.\n\n38:15.320 --> 38:18.320\nThey grab, and then he fades back.\n\n38:18.320 --> 38:20.320\nLike a bird.\n\n38:20.320 --> 38:22.320\nAnd then moves, drifts back in.\n\n38:22.320 --> 38:23.320\nOh, really?\n\n38:23.320 --> 38:25.320\nLike fucking Rocky Balboa?\n\n38:25.320 --> 38:27.320\nHe just goes, hey, down, Rock.\n\n38:27.320 --> 38:28.320\nYeah.\n\n38:28.320 --> 38:31.320\nHe just kind of, like, he just acts like a weather phenomenon.\n\n38:31.320 --> 38:33.320\nI don't want to praise this person.\n\n38:33.320 --> 38:35.320\nI don't think what he's doing is heroic.\n\n38:35.320 --> 38:38.320\nSo you've done 10 seconds of what's going on.\n\n38:38.320 --> 38:40.320\nI would go, do you walk away?\n\n38:40.320 --> 38:41.320\nDo you do a bit?\n\n38:41.320 --> 38:46.320\nHere's what I think I would do in my current mood right now.\n\n38:46.320 --> 38:48.320\nIt happens as you leave the room.\n\n38:48.320 --> 38:50.320\nI just got off the phone with Aaron.\n\n38:50.320 --> 38:51.320\nI'm not in a fight with Aaron.\n\n38:51.320 --> 38:52.320\nI'm not in a bad mood.\n\n38:52.320 --> 38:55.320\nI'm not feeling insecure about where I am in my life.\n\n38:55.320 --> 38:56.320\nI get off the phone.\n\n38:56.320 --> 38:58.320\nThere's a guy doing this.\n\n38:58.320 --> 38:59.320\nHe's a stranger to me.\n\n38:59.320 --> 39:00.320\nHe's holding a camera in my face.\n\n39:00.320 --> 39:02.320\nI would go, hello.\n\n39:02.320 --> 39:03.320\nI would be like, hi.\n\n39:03.320 --> 39:04.320\nWhat are you doing?\n\n39:04.320 --> 39:05.320\nWhat are you doing?\n\n39:05.320 --> 39:06.320\nWhat are you doing?\n\n39:06.320 --> 39:12.320\nFor a while, I would try to find his exhaustion point.\n\n39:12.320 --> 39:16.320\nI would be like, yeah.\n\n39:16.320 --> 39:18.320\nBut that's me.\n\n39:18.320 --> 39:21.320\nAnd I don't want to stress, that's me in a good depth.\n\n39:21.320 --> 39:23.320\nThere's a million ways you could catch me.\n\n39:23.320 --> 39:25.320\nI'd be like, what the fuck are you doing?\n\n39:25.320 --> 39:27.320\nLet's say you and Aaron, there's tension brewing.\n\n39:27.320 --> 39:30.320\nAnd let's say you got a call from, you know,\n\n39:30.320 --> 39:33.320\nan irritating call from an agent or a lawyer.\n\n39:33.320 --> 39:37.320\nOr like on the heels of me being all over the headlines online.\n\n39:37.320 --> 39:39.320\nWell, but Chevy Chase says, oh, the Chevy Chase.\n\n39:39.320 --> 39:40.320\nThe Chevy Chase.\n\n39:40.320 --> 39:41.320\nWell, that needed to happen.\n\n39:41.320 --> 39:42.320\nWell, that needed to happen.\n\n39:42.320 --> 39:43.320\nChevy Chase down in Harvard.\n\n39:43.320 --> 39:44.320\nYou'd assume that was a paparazzo couple.\n\n39:44.320 --> 39:45.320\nYeah.\n\n39:45.320 --> 39:47.320\nAnd I would be like, OK, hey, hi, Chevy Chase.\n\n39:47.320 --> 39:48.320\nHi.\n\n39:48.320 --> 39:51.320\nAnd then the guy would be like, stay there.\n\n39:51.320 --> 39:54.320\nAnd I'd be like, OK, so hi, hi, Chevy Chase.\n\n39:54.320 --> 39:56.320\nI don't, but, but, but.\n\n39:56.320 --> 39:59.320\nI think you should always do that whatever happens.\n\n39:59.320 --> 40:01.320\nBut, but, but the truth is.\n\n40:01.320 --> 40:03.320\nIf a stranger walks up to you and starts to shake your head.\n\n40:03.320 --> 40:04.320\nI think it's really interesting.\n\n40:04.320 --> 40:07.320\nThe series is that you're not dealing with people who,\n\n40:07.320 --> 40:10.320\nwho have any relationship with cameras at all.\n\n40:10.320 --> 40:12.320\nAnd that's the most interesting thing is that we,\n\n40:12.320 --> 40:18.320\nwe all have protocols that we initiate in when we feel like\n\n40:18.320 --> 40:20.320\nsomething strange is happening to us.\n\n40:20.320 --> 40:23.320\nAnd cameras dehumanize us.\n\n40:23.320 --> 40:27.320\nAnd we invented them to try to capture humanity.\n\n40:27.320 --> 40:30.320\nSo we're used to using these things.\n\n40:30.320 --> 40:33.320\nWhen we, when we see them, we're like, oh,\n\n40:33.320 --> 40:35.320\nI better be human now.\n\n40:35.320 --> 40:39.320\nHey, coming up next on Camera Face.\n\n40:39.320 --> 40:40.320\nComing at you.\n\n40:40.320 --> 40:43.320\nAnd what these people are doing is they're putting their poopy\n\n40:43.320 --> 40:46.320\nundies in a laundry, laundry machine.\n\n40:46.320 --> 40:48.320\nAnd then there's a, there's a lens there.\n\n40:48.320 --> 40:51.320\nAnd for me, the unspoken part of what some of them are saying\n\n40:51.320 --> 40:56.320\nwhen they like smash the camera is, is like, hey,\n\n40:56.320 --> 40:59.320\nwhen I'm ready to have a camera on me,\n\n40:59.320 --> 41:02.320\nI'll be really fucking, I'll have my shit together.\n\n41:02.320 --> 41:05.320\nYou know, I'm going to say some amazing things.\n\n41:05.320 --> 41:08.320\nAnd I'm going to, there's something, there's something strange.\n\n41:08.320 --> 41:13.320\nThat's just my own interpretation.\n\n41:13.320 --> 41:16.320\nBecause I'm coming from a really specific place.\n\n41:16.320 --> 41:18.320\nI think what's interesting about it is that it,\n\n41:18.320 --> 41:20.320\nit feels like this kid, I don't hear,\n\n41:20.320 --> 41:23.320\nI don't know if he's 15, 25, 48.\n\n41:23.320 --> 41:28.320\nHe might have a fucking like tiger scars down his face.\n\n41:28.320 --> 41:31.320\nLike, like, like, he may look the whole point maybe\n\n41:31.320 --> 41:33.320\nthat this guy looks like a fucking monster\n\n41:33.320 --> 41:36.320\nand has a camera.\n\n41:36.320 --> 41:39.320\nWhat I'm seeing on the videos is the equivalent of like,\n\n41:39.320 --> 41:42.320\nif you took like goggles and didn't even strap them\n\n41:42.320 --> 41:44.320\nto the back of your head, but just put them down\n\n41:44.320 --> 41:48.320\nin a Caribbean like coral reef and like just,\n\n41:48.320 --> 41:51.320\nlike you're always looking at people as if they're animals.\n\n41:51.320 --> 41:54.320\nI've been asked several times, I was on the show in time\n\n41:54.320 --> 41:57.320\nwhen there was like a sketch show, like a TV show.\n\n41:57.320 --> 41:59.320\nAnd also I've been asked to do other things\n\n41:59.320 --> 42:00.320\nthat were hidden camera shows.\n\n42:00.320 --> 42:02.320\nI did one, I did Jimmy Kennedy experiment.\n\n42:02.320 --> 42:03.320\nI don't like it.\n\n42:03.320 --> 42:06.320\nI don't like ambush style stuff.\n\n42:06.320 --> 42:08.320\nLike, because they tend, those shows tend to,\n\n42:08.320 --> 42:10.320\nsomebody kind of has to lose a little bit.\n\n42:10.320 --> 42:12.320\nAnd I don't think it's funny when someone loses.\n\n42:12.320 --> 42:15.320\nAnd I was supposed to, we were on Venice Beach doing these bits.\n\n42:15.320 --> 42:17.320\nAnd this is a show called Daner Channel that was on\n\n42:17.320 --> 42:19.320\nfor like six episodes a long time ago.\n\n42:19.320 --> 42:22.320\nAnd we were on Venice Beach and there was a crack house\n\n42:22.320 --> 42:24.320\nlike looking place across the boardwalk.\n\n42:24.320 --> 42:26.320\nThat was where the hidden cameras were.\n\n42:26.320 --> 42:28.320\nThere was a guy dressed as a bum that was a cameraman.\n\n42:28.320 --> 42:29.320\nSo he's laying by.\n\n42:29.320 --> 42:30.320\nSo there was cameras everywhere.\n\n42:30.320 --> 42:32.320\nAnd I had glasses on early day like camera,\n\n42:32.320 --> 42:34.320\nlike in the middle of the glasses.\n\n42:34.320 --> 42:36.320\nAnd I had, I was selling stuff.\n\n42:36.320 --> 42:38.320\nAnd I did this one because I thought I could make it funny kind of.\n\n42:38.320 --> 42:40.320\nAnd so I was selling that with a dolphin jerky.\n\n42:40.320 --> 42:43.320\nAnd people get really bummed out about it.\n\n42:43.320 --> 42:46.320\nBut I mean, there was also some people who was like,\n\n42:46.320 --> 42:47.320\nI'll try that dolphin jerky.\n\n42:47.320 --> 42:52.320\nAnd there was a little sticker on it with a picture of a tuna\n\n42:52.320 --> 42:54.320\nand a line through it like it was tuna safe.\n\n42:54.320 --> 42:57.320\nBut there was one we're selling.\n\n42:57.320 --> 43:00.320\nAnd it was Che Guevara's.\n\n43:00.320 --> 43:03.320\nIt was a cereal, but Che Guevara based cereal.\n\n43:03.320 --> 43:05.320\nOr your Che Crunchies or something like that.\n\n43:05.320 --> 43:07.320\nAnd they were a little bit,\n\n43:07.320 --> 43:10.320\ninstead of like green clovers and blue stars or whatever the fuck,\n\n43:10.320 --> 43:13.320\nit was like cameras and sickles and revolutionary stars.\n\n43:13.320 --> 43:18.320\nAnd so I'm selling these Che Crunchies and these three girls come up\n\n43:18.320 --> 43:21.320\nand they're like kind of tough.\n\n43:21.320 --> 43:27.320\nAnd I would describe if I could guess what their lifestyle was.\n\n43:27.320 --> 43:31.320\nAnarchists are like very left leaning, possibly lesbian.\n\n43:31.320 --> 43:35.320\nLots of piercings, probably very intellectual.\n\n43:35.320 --> 43:38.320\nAnd also like a little bit of LA street tough kind of, you know,\n\n43:38.320 --> 43:41.320\nlike they didn't come from like privilege or anything.\n\n43:41.320 --> 43:44.320\nAnd they came up and they were instantly just fucking bummed out about it.\n\n43:44.320 --> 43:47.320\nAnd I have a little ear speaker or whatever they call it, earwig things.\n\n43:47.320 --> 43:49.320\nAnd I have the producers saying like,\n\n43:49.320 --> 43:51.320\noh yeah, these are good, these are good, go after these girls, go after these girls.\n\n43:51.320 --> 43:53.320\nI'm like, I'm not going to fucking go after these girls.\n\n43:53.320 --> 43:55.320\nKill her, kill me.\n\n43:55.320 --> 43:57.320\nAnd they're like, what the fuck's up with the cereal?\n\n43:57.320 --> 44:00.320\nDo you think that Che Guevara, if you were alive today, would sign off on that?\n\n44:00.320 --> 44:02.320\nDo you think it's family?\n\n44:02.320 --> 44:04.320\nAnd I was like, no, no, no, half of the proceeds,\n\n44:04.320 --> 44:06.320\nif you buy a box of Che Crunchies,\n\n44:06.320 --> 44:10.320\ngoes to these Appetistas living in the hills of Chiapas.\n\n44:10.320 --> 44:14.320\nAnd then the speaker, they're like, no, no, no, antagonize it.\n\n44:14.320 --> 44:16.320\nI'm like, fuck you.\n\n44:16.320 --> 44:19.320\nI said, they're like,

01:02:16.320\nwhere the indigenous population was just left.\n\n01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:22.320\nI guess I'll eat another coconut by opening it with my laser eyes.\n\n01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.320\nOh,

01:02:47.320\nIt's kind of an acceptable crime rate.\n\n01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.320\nJust the threat that Superman might ever come back\n\n01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:54.320\nis actually putting us way above Flint, Michigan.\n\n01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.320\nThis is great.\n\n01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:01.320\nYeah, but Chief, Superman's due to come back next Thursday.\n\n01:03:01.320 -->

Luthor, yes.\n\n01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.320\nI have dedicated my life to figuring out how.\n\n01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.320\nHow can you do it?\n\n01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.320\nWith this green knife.\n\n01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.320\nOkay, go do it.\n\n01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320\nNASA, can you help?\n\n01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320\nYeah, we're happy to.\n\n01:03:18.320 -->

credits.\n\n01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.320\nDeath to Superman.\n\n01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.320\nDeath to Superman.\n\n01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.320\nThere's no Lois Lane in that movie?\n\n01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.320\nYeah, she, she, you know what?\n\n01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.320\nI'll bring in a Lois Lane consultant.\n\n01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.320\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.320\nI'm just asking.\n\n01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.320\nI guess not.\n\n01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.320\nNo, there's no Lois Lane.\n\n01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:07.320\nSo we just root for like the lieutenant and Lex Luthor.\n\n01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.320\nWhat are all the people he saved throughout this time?\n\n01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.320\nThere's lots of people like that.\n\n01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.320\nThey went on with their lives.\n\n01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.320\nBut wouldn't they be grateful and feel bad?\n\n01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.320\nTo what end?\n\n01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.320\nHumanity.\n\n01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.320\nWell, they're going to show up every time Superman's in trouble now?\n\n01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.320\nThat's not saving.\n\n01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.320\nThat town hall meeting, for instance,\n\n01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.320\nwhen everyone's like boo boo boo,\n\n01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.320\nwouldn't it be an old lady in the bag,\n\n01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.320\nwill he save my husband from falling off the seat?\n\n01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320\nHe saved me.\n\n01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320\nRight?\n\n01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.320\nNo, it's, it's, well, that was 20 minutes of my movies an hour and a half.\n\n01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320\nOkay.\n\n01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.320\nThere's shit like that.\n\n01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320\nYou...\n\n01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.320\nOkay, okay, good.\n\n01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.320\nSo there are people that...\n\n01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.320\nNo, it's a complicated film.\n\n01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.320\nRight.\n\n01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.320\nThere are so many people who have a complicated relationship with Superman.\n\n01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.320\nI think it's a big role for Gary Sinise to tackle.\n\n01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.320\nYeah.\n\n01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:53.320\nI'm out of breath just auditioning for it.\n\n01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.320\nJust knocking him out.\n\n01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.320\nAll right.\n\n01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.320\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.320\nI just don't think that Superman's a compelling character.\n\n01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.320\nHe's born too gifted.\n\n01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.320\nIs that a problem?\n\n01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.320\nNo.\n\n01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.320\nNo.\n\n01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.320\nNope.\n\n01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.320\nNope.\n\n01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.320\nNo.\n\n01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.320\nBut I do think knowing that, like, you know,\n\n01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.320\nif you know that the two Jewish kids made him,\n\n01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.320\nI think that's heart-wrenching.\n\n01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.320\nBecause they're like,\n\n01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.320\nwhat if you were a fucking Superman and it's like,\n\n01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.320\nholy shit, Jesus Christ,\n\n01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.320\nI'm not going to take that away from you.\n\n01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.320\nExcept you just did with a kryptonite knife.\n\n01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:37.320\nIt's kind of a Nazi movie.\n\n01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.320\nIt actually becomes like the,\n\n01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.320\nyeah, you're right.\n\n01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.320\nNo, you're right.\n\n01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.320\nThat is terrible.\n\n01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.320\nThat's the complicated thing.\n\n01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.320\nYou took the only mythology the Jews have\n\n01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.320\nwhen they rise up.\n\n01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.320\nWell, I take exception to that.\n\n01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.320\nI did not take the only mythology Jews have.\n\n01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.320\nAway from them.\n\n01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.320\nI mean, like superhero, like redemptive post-World War II,\n\n01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.320\nlike cultural shit.\n\n01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.320\nYes.\n\n01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.320\nIf you're a Superman fan,\n\n01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.320\nI wouldn't mind talking to you.\n\n01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.320\nAll right.\n\n01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.320\nAll right.\n\n01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.320\nFuck it.\n\n01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.320\nGet this guy up here.\n\n01:07:08.320 -->

unfortunately.\n\n01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.320\nI apologize.\n\n01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:59.320\nI'm not like, I do a million things.\n\n01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.320\nI'm mad if people ask me why I do them.\n\n01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.320\nI'm literally only asking because I can't,\n\n01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.320\nat the bar, I can't go up to somebody\n\n01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.320\nand ask those questions.\n\n01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.320\nSo I thought I would take the opportunity\n\n01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.320\nbecause it would be a tool if I did that.\n\n01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.320\nAnd now I just offended somebody\n\n01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.320\nby making that impression of a, yeah.\n\n01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.320\nBut I, yeah, I just, you're the first person\n\n01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.320\nI've ever actually had the opportunity to ask you.\n\n01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.320\nAll right, what was your name?\n\n01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:27.320\nEric.\n\n01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.320\nEric, all right.\n\n01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.320\nSo why were you up here again?\n\n01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.320\nSuperman.\n\n01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.320\nWow.\n\n01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.320\nSuperman.\n\n01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.320\nI had a question, actually.\n\n01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.320\nMake us like Superman.\n\n01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.320\nAll right, you have a question.\n\n01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.320\nYeah, just as a person who is oftentimes like,\n\n01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.320\nI see you as a Clark Kent type character.\n\n01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.320\nYou're an exceptional person.\n\n01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.320\nAnd there are folks who hate you for trying\n\n01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.320\nand they want to tear you down for daring to fly.\n\n01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.320\nAnd that's kind of like Clark Kent's story.\n\n01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.320\nIt's a man who's like trying to be his best self\n\n01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.320\nand he made me a challenge again.\n\n01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.320\nBut Clark Kent is a lie.\n\n01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.320\nClark Kent isn't a real person.\n\n01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.320\nWell, no, he was born like, he was an adopted guy.\n\n01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.320\nYeah, he grew up without powers\n\n01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.320\nand he gradually grew into him.\n\n01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.320\nIt's like puberty.\n\n01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.320\nBut he was like, that was his identity.\n\n01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.320\nIt wasn't like he's like,\n\n01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.320\nnow I'm going to hide his Clark Kent.\n\n01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.320\nHe grew up as Clark Kent\n\n01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.320\nand eventually formed the Superman identity.\n\n01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.320\nOkay, I never thought about it.\n\n01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.320\nI guess I knew that, but wasn't looking at that one.\n\n01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320\nYeah, I didn't really think about it.\n\n01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320\nWell, the extra minute is who you are\n\n01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.320\nwhen the cameras are on.\n\n01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.320\nIt's your higher self.\n\n01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320\nIt's him trying to be the best.\n\n01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.320\nEven Clark isn't really like that.\n\n01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.320\nHe uses a different tone of voice.\n\n01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.320\nHe parts his hair in a different part of his head.\n\n01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.320\nHe dresses differently, obviously.\n\n01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.320\nIt's him trying to be his best self\n\n01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.320\nand putting his best foot forward.\n\n01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.320\nI think at home,\n\n01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.320\nand the fortress will sell to you.\n\n01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.320\nI think he needs that\n\n01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.320\nbecause he has the like,\n\n01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.320\noh, fuck, what am I doing?\n\n01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.320\nI'm not sure, I understand.\n\n01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.320\nYeah, well, I guess that makes it really interesting.\n\n01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.320\nThe idea that he...\n\n01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.320\nMy question is what makes the character interesting\n\n01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.320\nbecause my question is at a certain point\n\n01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.320\nwhen he finally, for the fifth time,\n\n01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.320\nrealizes that he can go anywhere,\n\n01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.320\nlive anywhere, do whatever he wants.\n\n01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.320\nHe can make his nose make money.\n\n01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.320\nLike, Superman just can do whatever he wants.\n\n01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.320\nHe would crush a coal in a diamond.\n\n01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:04.320\nThere's an emotional component of his actual...\n\n01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.320\nHe's like, yeah, but where's home?\n\n01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.320\nWho am I?\n\n01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.320\nIsn't that lonely?\n\n01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320\nHaven't you ever like...\n\n01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320\nI don't know.\n\n01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.320\nI used to have a girlfriend\n\n01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.320\nwho I loved dearly\n\n01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.320\nwho didn't really do the kind of things I did.\n\n01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.320\nHe was kind of like a common person.\n\n01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.320\nThere's nothing wrong with that,\n\n01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.320\nbut I wanted to do more.\n\n01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.320\nI wanted to move to LA.\n\n01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.320\nI wanted to succeed in writing.\n\n01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.320\nAnd this person was just someone\n\n01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.320\nwho had like a menial kind of like Walmart job.\n\n01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.320\nAnd that was very lonely for me.\n\n01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.320\nI couldn't relate to her.\n\n01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.320\nAnd I see Clark Kent as that kind of like,\n\n01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.320\nconstantly ostracized by Lex Luthor\n\n01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.320\nand those kind of like Twitter assholes.\n\n01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.320\nAnd then personally, like, his only friend is Batman.\n\n01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.320\nHe's like the baddest ass guy in the world.\n\n01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.320\nWait a minute.\n\n01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.320\nYou're saying the best version of him\n\n01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.320\nis the Clark Kent side of his life\n\n01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.320\nbecause that's him trying to be human\n\n01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.320\nand be loved and be...\n\n01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:51.320\nHe actually doesn't think of himself as Superman.\n\n01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.320\nI have to slick myself up in the morning\n\n01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320\nto go outside and talk to people.\n\n01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.320\nI feel like that's him putting on the Superman ass.\n\n01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.320\nHe believes that he is Clark Kent.\n\n01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.320\nThat's who he is.\n\n01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.320\nBecause that's what it says on his birth certificate\n\n01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.320\nand that's what it says in his yearbook.\n\n01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.320\nSo when he has to go into the phone booth\n\n01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.320\nand become Superman, is he bummed out about that?\n\n01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320\nIs that a burden for him?\n\n01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.320\nI think it's just another role.\n\n01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.320\nI don't think he really identifies as Superman.\n\n01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.320\nIt's a job he has to do and he has to keep it separate from...\n\n01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.320\nHe's actually protecting Clark Kent.\n\n01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320\nI never looked at it that way.\n\n01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.320\nAll right, I like Superman now.\n\n01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.320\nEric, everybody!\n\n01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.320\nWait, no, stay, Eric.\n\n01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.320\nBecause we're going to play Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.320\nHow many characters do we need?\n\n01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.320\nWell, we typically roll with four characters, but, you know...\n\n01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.320\nSo we need...\n\n01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.320\nNot that I see gender, but let's get a young lady up here.\n\n01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.320\nOr an old lady.\n\n01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.320\nNot that I see age, either.\n\n01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320\nWhat did you say?\n\n01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.320\nMy lowest lane is here.\n\n01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.320\nBut that would be unfair, wouldn't it?\n\n01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.320\nWe need to get someone else's lowest lane up here.\n\n01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.320\nOr someone who is their own She-Ra.\n\n01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.320\nIs there anyone who happened to...\n\n01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.320\nWho happens to have more ovaries than testes that...\n\n01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.320\nThat wants to play D&D tonight?\n\n01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.320\nNo? Okay, good, fine.\n\n01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.320\nI saw you...\n\n01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.320\nI saw you shrugging.\n\n01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.320\nYou played before, right?\n\n01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.320\nYou've never played?\n\n01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.320\nWho's back there?\n\n01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.320\nI actually played once, too. I could swap out.\n\n01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.320\nWell, let's not unravel the whole carpet.\n\n01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:29.320\nDan, is it all the counterintuitive?\n\n01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.320\nLet's bring up his girlfriend.\n\n01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.320\nIs it your girlfriend?\n\n01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.320\nYeah.\n\n01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.320\nThis is not the one the Walmart one.\n\n01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.320\nNo, no.\n\n01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.320\nThank God.\n\n01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.320\nGive it to someone else. I hang out at your house.\n\n01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.320\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.320\nWho isn't back there?\n\n01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.320\nI saw a hand come up. Who is it?\n\n01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320\nI thought I saw...\n\n01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.320\nNo?\n\n01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.320\nYes, yes, you.\n\n01:13:52.320 --> 01:14:02.320\nCome on up.\n\n01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.320\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.320\nLaurel.\n\n01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.320\nLaurel?\n\n01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.320\nLaurel.\n\n01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.320\nLaurel.\n\n01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.320\nOh, Laurel, sorry.\n\n01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:15.320\nHave we met Laurel?\n\n01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.320\nNo, we have not.\n\n01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.320\nOkay. And Eric, okay.\n\n01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.320\nAll right, thank you for coming up.\n\n01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.320\nWell, that was so arduous.\n\n01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.320\nI wasn't here last week, and I forgot to listen to the episode,\n\n01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.320\nso I don't know what happened.\n\n01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.320\nHow did you forget?\n\n01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.320\nI was out of town.\n\n01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.320\nI meant to listen to the next day, and I just got distracted.\n\n01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.320\nThen I forgot all about it.\n\n01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.320\nOkay.\n\n01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.320\nI normally, when I'm not here, listen to the D&D part at least,\n\n01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.320\njust so I'm caught up on that.\n\n01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.320\nAll right, if you guys can figure this out.\n\n01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.320\nOne of you is Christopher Berg, and one of you is Mulray and Sedona.\n\n01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.320\nIt's all made up.\n\n01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.320\nEric and Laurel, are you familiar with these characters a bit?\n\n01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320\nI am, yeah.\n\n01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320\nA little bit.\n\n01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.320\nProbably more than Dan and I.\n\n01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.320\nAll right, yeah, hand me over the quarks.\n\n01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.320\nYeah, grab yours off the top there.\n\n01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.320\nThey're all cleverly placed in top to bottom.\n\n01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320\nEric, you're Christopher Berg.\n\n01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.320\nLaurel, you're Mulray.\n\n01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.320\nYou do Mulray in there?\n\n01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.320\nYeah.\n\n01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.320\nThis is exciting stuff.\n\n01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.320\nShit, sir.\n\n01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.320\nYou got mine too?\n\n01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.320\nTake the top two sheets and pass them down.\n\n01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.320\nOkay, we did it.\n\n01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.320\nThis show is podcast gold.\n\n01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.320\nAll right, guys, go ahead and see it.\n\n01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.320\nIt was a harm and tell when you passed the papers around for two minutes.\n\n01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.320\nYou didn't see it.\n\n01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.320\nYou weren't there, man.\n\n01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.320\nYou had to be there, man.\n\n01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.320\nYou were passing you around.\n\n01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.320\nThere was a lot of dead air.\n\n01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.320\nIt was really good.\n\n01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.320\nThere were six sheets and then four.\n\n01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.320\nTell me about it.\n\n01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:50.320\nTyler asked, he likes the idea that there's a Harmontown fan that talks like that.\n\n01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:56.320\nMan, Harmontown was really rocking last night.\n\n01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.320\nIt was a super outer space pajama man of episode.\n\n01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.320\nI didn't think Dan would pick Chili, but he picked it.\n\n01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.320\nThey're goodness here.\n\n01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.320\nI think it's pretty amazing that not that it was a Herculean effort,\n\n01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.320\nbut that you softened Dan's dance on Superman in about eight sentences.\n\n01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.320\nIt really did.\n\n01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.320\nActually, yeah, that's true.\n\n01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:21.320\nIt's just a matter of quickly shifting one important thing.\n\n01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.320\nBut the fact that you don't take that away from Superman,\n\n01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:27.320\nyou don't remember it that way, that you've taken another stance on it.\n\n01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.320\nYeah, well, because I was, yeah, I think we all, yeah.\n\n01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.320\nYou think about it in terms of comic books that you may or may not have ever read,\n\n01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:39.320\nand I think that, of course, I've never read a Superman comic book.\n\n01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:43.320\nI am familiar with Superman from a certain perspective,\n\n01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.320\nand I always identify with the criminal.\n\n01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:46.320\nNo, Eric.\n\n01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:49.320\nBecause I never actually, like, and I was aware that,\n\n01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:53.320\nokay, yeah, he came down to Earth and he was raised by these kids,\n\n01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.320\nthese parents and small, but I never, something,\n\n01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.320\nthere was a tissue paper thin thing that needed to be poked through.\n\n01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.320\nSomebody needed to go, no, he thinks he's Clark Kent.\n\n01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.320\nHe doesn't think he's Superman.\n\n01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.320\nNow, Eric, I've only seen the movies.\n\n01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.320\nI've never read a Superman comic.\n\n01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.320\nWhat's coming through in the movies, do you think?\n\n01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.320\nMore so in the comics.\n\n01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.320\nI'm a big fan of the comics, the other Mark Wade stuff,\n\n01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.320\nand Smallville was cool for Lex Luthor, too.\n\n01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.320\nThey had the idea there that there was a guy who was very exceptional\n\n01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:20.320\nand used to getting his own way, and, like, the Harvard graduate in the room,\n\n01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.320\nand he was this new kid, and that was kind of fun in that series.\n\n01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.320\nBut the idea that anyone, like, if someone else gets something,\n\n01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.320\nthey're not taking anything away from you,\n\n01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.320\nand that's the central idea that Lex Luthor can't understand,\n\n01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.320\nbut, like, he can't just succeed alongside you.\n\n01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.320\nHe has to have it all himself, and that's really compelling to me.\n\n01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.320\nBut no, I don't think that they really delved into that, Jeff,\n\n01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.320\nwhat you were asking about.\n\n01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:43.320\nI don't think, like, they really dropped the ball with those narrative opportunities\n\n01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:48.320\nbecause they don't really provide a good case on why he's alienated and stuff.\n\n01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.320\nThey just make it seem like it's great,\n\n01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.320\nand then in one scene it really sucks to be him,\n\n01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.320\nand then it's great again.\n\n01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.320\nWell, and now he, like, murders dudes.\n\n01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.320\nNow he's super alone because he's, like, this ultra cop,\n\n01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.320\nand he's the guy who's responsible.\n\n01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.320\nHe's super dead.\n\n01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.320\nHe's responsible for everyone on the planet.\n\n01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.320\nSo now Lex is correct.\n\n01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.320\nThat's weird.\n\n01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.320\nHe's no greater superhero than Iron Man.\n\n01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.320\nWell, agreed, yeah, naturally.\n\n01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.320\nBecause he's, like, super flawed.\n\n01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.320\nBecause he's not a superhero.\n\n01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.320\nYeah, he and Spider-Man are really relatable.\n\n01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.320\nHe's a fucking human being that earned everything\n\n01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.320\nand pays the price through alcoholism.\n\n01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.320\nHe's, like, nothing.\n\n01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.320\nNo radioactive spider, nothing.\n\n01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:26.320\nLike, I respect Spider-Man, but you get bit by a spider.\n\n01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.320\nLike, try being a dude.\n\n01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:31.320\nBut his dad was, like, a real, you know...\n\n01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.320\nYeah.\n\n01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.320\nHe's pretty.\n\n01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.320\nHe was raised by Howard Hughes.\n\n01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.320\nHe went off.\n\n01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.320\nYeah.\n\n01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.320\nYeah.\n\n01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.320\nHe's gonna earn it all himself.\n\n01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.320\nYeah.\n\n01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.320\nAnd those movies are fucking awesome.\n\n01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.320\nYeah, no.\n\n01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.320\nBring it on the third one.\n\n01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.320\nBut, I mean...\n\n01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.320\nI've never seen or read an Iron Man thing.\n\n01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.320\nSo he was born wealthy, though, right?\n\n01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.320\nYeah.\n\n01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.320\nHis dad was, like, almost as good of a genius as he was\n\n01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.320\nand also pretty successful.\n\n01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.320\nThat's as much of a radioactive spider as anything else.\n\n01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.320\nBut now he's...\n\n01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.320\nRight.\n\n01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.320\nBut, okay, alright.\n\n01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320\nHe's rebelling now, though.\n\n01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.320\nIt's more like bad.\n\n01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.320\nNow he's a hero and giving back to humanity\n\n01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.320\nbecause his dad just took...\n\n01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.320\nBecause that was, like, this kind of brand-based man.\n\n01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.320\nTony Stark's dad, like...\n\n01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.320\nYeah, Tony Stark's dad is as good as Tony Stark, but...\n\n01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.320\nBut...\n\n01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.320\nOkay, alright.\n\n01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.320\nTony Stark is as smart as his dad, if not more.\n\n01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.320\nAnd fucking, like, took it and ran with it.\n\n01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.320\nYeah.\n\n01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.320\nAnd, yeah, he's a solipsist and he's, like...\n\n01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.320\nBut his dad built weapons and, like, all their money comes from blood money.\n\n01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.320\nYeah.\n\n01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.320\nSo now he's now a son as a hero so he's gonna save people\n\n01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.320\nwith kind of a tone with that father.\n\n01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.320\nYeah.\n\n01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320\nAlright.\n\n01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.320\nI'm gonna see those movies.\n\n01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.320\nIf you wanna borrow some comics, I mean...\n\n01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.320\nLook, look, we're already dating.\n\n01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.320\nWe've established that.\n\n01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.320\nI'm trying, man.\n\n01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.320\nIn the morning when I'm leaving and I put a rose on your pillow,\n\n01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.320\nI'm taking some of your comics with me.\n\n01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.320\nI'm making Tumblr jellies.\n\n01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:49.320\nWait, you're making Tumblr jello?\n\n01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.320\nTumblr jellies.\n\n01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.320\nOh, okay, wow.\n\n01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.320\nI wanna try your famous Tumblr jello.\n\n01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.320\nWell, that's for breakfast.\n\n01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.320\nAlright, let's play some D&D for pity's sake.\n\n01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.320\nAlright.\n\n01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.320\nAlright.\n\n01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.320\nLast time on Harmontown.\n\n01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.320\nAfter getting to the Floating Isle of Paradise,\n\n01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.320\nour heroes met with the island's guardian,\n\n01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.320\nYomiji the Angel,\n\n01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.320\nand together cured Chris de Burgh of his possession.\n\n01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:19.320\nHowever, in the process, they freed Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:23.320\nWith his new ghastly form, Darkstar possessed Yomiji\n\n01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.320\nand assaulted the gang mercilessly.\n\n01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.320\nQuark accidentally set the island on fire,\n\n01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:30.320\nand Paradise began falling from the sky.\n\n01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.320\nActing quickly, Moraine leapt for the portal,\n\n01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.320\ncatching the razor-sharp rim and pulling herself\n\n01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:38.320\ninto Bill Martigan's, and with her rope...\n\n01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.320\nOur...\n\n01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.320\nAnd with our rope,\n\n01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.320\nmanaged to pull the rest of our heroes to safety.\n\n01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.320\nAs Darkstar flew away and his heavenly host,\n\n01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.320\nour hero relished their victory,\n\n01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.320\nheading to the nearest tavern.\n\n01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.320\nThere they encountered some gnomes and a small automaton,\n\n01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.320\nand after a brief discussion,\n\n01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:57.320\nMoraine held up the gnomes with her bows,\n\n01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.320\nsnatching away the machine's blueprints from the helpless gnomes,\n\n01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.320\nwhile Quark grabbed the baby bot.\n\n01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.320\nBut what would the gang do with the machine?\n\n01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.320\nWhat if they got caught?\n\n01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.320\nIt's a fucking good episode I missed.\n\n01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:12.320\nWould our heroes be able to escape from Bill Martigan's\n\n01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.320\nwith their robot or their lives?\n\n01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.320\nLet's find out now.\n\n01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.320\nHarmontown.\n\n01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.320\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.320\nOkay.\n\n01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.320\nHelping no amount over here.\n\n01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.320\nThere's a robot?\n\n01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.320\nA baby robot.\n\n01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.320\nA baby robot?\n\n01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.320\nWas it in the bar?\n\n01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.320\nYeah.\n\n01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.320\nAnd what were the blueprints that we stole?\n\n01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.320\nThey were for the baby robot.\n\n01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.320\nThere was baby blueprints.\n\n01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.320\nBaby blueprints.\n\n01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.320\nBaby robot blueprints.\n\n01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.320\nRubber baby blueprints.\n\n01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.320\nRubber baby robot blueprints.\n\n01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.320\nRubber baby robot blueprints.\n\n01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:50.320\nAnd we wanted to steal these because we wanted a baby robot?\n\n01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.320\nYeah.\n\n01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.320\nIs there a baby robot or just the blueprints to make a baby robot?\n\n01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.320\nThere's also a baby robot.\n\n01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.320\nAnd so these gnomes at the bar were hanging out\n\n01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.320\nand they got a baby robot.\n\n01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.320\nYeah.\n\n01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.320\nAnd they have the blueprints to make another baby robot.\n\n01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.320\nYeah.\n\n01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.320\nBut then Mulrainee held them up with her bow\n\n01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.320\nand you grabbed the robot.\n\n01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.320\nAll right.\n\n01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.320\nSo I got the robot.\n\n01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.320\nYeah.\n\n01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.320\nDescribe this robot for me please.\n\n01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:14.320\nIt looks like a gnome if it were a child.\n\n01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.320\nIt's maybe two and a half feet tall.\n\n01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.320\nIt's all silvery and it's got empty eye sockets\n\n01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.320\nor you know, empty.\n\n01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.320\nOkay.\n\n01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.320\nIt also has a weird cavity in its chest\n\n01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.320\nlike something supposed to like fit in there.\n\n01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.320\nWell you know what I'm going to do.\n\n01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:37.320\nYou're not going to ask me twice.\n\n01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:44.320\nI don't fuck the baby robot's chest yet.\n\n01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.320\nI'm going to learn a little bit more about this baby robot.\n\n01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.320\nSo the gnomes kind of stand with their hands up\n\n01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.320\nall surrender style and they're like,\n\n01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.320\nI don't know what to do because not to metagame\n\n01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:01.320\nbut Kumail and Aaron where they instigated this robbery.\n\n01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.320\nThe chapter ended with me going,\n\n01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.320\nwhat the fuck?\n\n01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.320\nSo now we could have maybe purchased it\n\n01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.320\nor they might have just given it to us or some shit.\n\n01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.320\nWell you guys don't have any money.\n\n01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.320\nIs this like Astro Boy?\n\n01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.320\nDid they like lose their baby and they're building a new one?\n\n01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.320\nIt's like sad.\n\n01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.320\nThose are great questions.\n\n01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:21.320\nI'm going to ask them like what this baby is.\n\n01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.320\nI asked the, how many gnomes are in the bar?\n\n01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.320\nThree.\n\n01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:30.320\nI asked these gnomes, who is the owner of this baby robot?\n\n01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.320\nHey Jack, take it easy.\n\n01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.320\nIt's all going to be okay.\n\n01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:39.320\nI'd say put the baby down.\n\n01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.320\nI mean this is me talking.\n\n01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:47.320\nLook, I wasn't here so I hand the baby to you\n\n01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.320\nand go do what you feel.\n\n01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.320\nI've got the baby now I'm putting it down.\n\n01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.320\nI don't want to metagame but it wasn't me\n\n01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.320\nthat started this robbery.\n\n01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.320\nYou're having a quarrel of conscious with me.\n\n01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.320\nI never wanted to steal nothing from no one.\n\n01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:09.320\nI was appreciating the opportunity to be between adventures.\n\n01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.320\nI certainly didn't want to start a new one by robbing anybody.\n\n01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:20.320\nAnd even if I did, even if I did, I wouldn't have robbed a baby.\n\n01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:26.320\nEven in a mystical Middle Earth realm that seems over the line.\n\n01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.320\nHere's your baby.\n\n01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.320\nMy name is Sharpie.\n\n01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:37.320\nI'm going to go over there and I'm going to hang out by the jukebox.\n\n01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:40.320\nAlright, I guess you give them their baby back.\n\n01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.320\nThey want their baby back, baby back, baby back.\n\n01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.320\nFuck you.\n\n01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.320\nThere isn't a jukebox.\n\n01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.320\nI know.\n\n01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.320\nJust don't exist.\n\n01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.320\nBartender, let's buy everybody here a round.\n\n01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.320\nYou don't actually see any bartender.\n\n01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.320\nThese three guys are the only ones in the room.\n\n01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:06.320\nI'd like to buy you all a drink for seeming like I was going to steal your baby.\n\n01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:13.320\nI'd feel a lot better if you could get your friend to a lower bow there.\n\n01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.320\nYeah, I'll lower my bow.\n\n01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.320\nOkay.\n\n01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:23.320\nSee, what happens is, non-nome people, we have...\n\n01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.320\nDo you guys know what Jack Russell Terriers are?\n\n01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.320\nNo.\n\n01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.320\nIt's like a dog.\n\n01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.320\nIt's beloved, but it's got a predilection for...\n\n01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.320\nOh, like a blink dog.\n\n01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:42.320\nDifferent breeds of man have different predilections for different obsessive behavior.\n\n01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:49.320\nWe came in here for a drink and we just freaked out for a second.\n\n01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.320\nSpencer, since I'm a gnome, do I have kind of an automatic in with these guys?\n\n01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.320\nIs there some affinity there?\n\n01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.320\nOr am I still kind of a potential threat because of avoidable...\n\n01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:00.320\nI feel like you guys really burned through that.\n\n01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:05.320\nWhatever equity I had has been wasted?\n\n01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.320\nYeah.\n\n01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.320\nAll right.\n\n01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.320\nI say, I'm sorry, who is the owner of this baby?\n\n01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320\nOh, that's me.\n\n01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:12.320\nWhat's your name, my friend?\n\n01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.320\nWalt.\n\n01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.320\nWalt?\n\n01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.320\nHey, I'm Quark.\n\n01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.320\nSorry about the whole...\n\n01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.320\nLook, we've had a long day.\n\n01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.320\nWe just fell through paradise when we killed the big angel thing or whatever.\n\n01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.320\nThis is...\n\n01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.320\nAdmiral Darkstar has been up our dick for the fucking last couple years.\n\n01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:31.320\nI gotta admit, it's pretty hard to connect with you guys emotionally.\n\n01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.320\nLook, I understand.\n\n01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.320\nWe'll walk away, but we'll leave you guys to do your thing.\n\n01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.320\nI say we just leave these guys.\n\n01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.320\nLike, we never came in here.\n\n01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.320\nWe never came in here.\n\n01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.320\nI give them...\n\n01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.320\nI give them a dollar.\n\n01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.320\nI toss in my nutsack.\n\n01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.320\nI have a sack of nuts.\n\n01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.320\nI give them my nutsack.\n\n01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.320\nI go, enjoy some nuts.\n\n01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.320\nIt's pretty delicious.\n\n01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:52.320\nYou know what?\n\n01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.320\nI give them 50 feet of rope.\n\n01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:55.320\nReally?\n\n01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.320\nYeah, because you never know.\n\n01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.320\nAs you hand them 50 feet of rope, you hear behind you several footsteps.\n\n01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.320\nSeveral sets of footsteps.\n\n01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.320\nWe're gonna need that rope.\n\n01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.320\nI hang onto the rope, and I do one of these.\n\n01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.320\nI go, if there's a motherfucker's creeping up on me, I'm keeping the rope.\n\n01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.320\nThat's what I do.\n\n01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:15.320\nAnd it's for the trailer.\n\n01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.320\nThat's pretty nice there.\n\n01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.320\nYeah.\n\n01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:24.320\nSo you see behind you, three gnomes have walked in the front door.\n\n01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.320\nThey're looking pretty cool, cool dudes.\n\n01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.320\nThey're all wearing lime green scarves on their necks.\n\n01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.320\nCool.\n\n01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.320\nGuys, what's up?\n\n01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.320\nWhat are you guys doing in our turf?\n\n01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.320\nHey, here to buy you a drink?\n\n01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.320\nTalk about being a gnome.\n\n01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:45.320\nI got my gnome friend.\n\n01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:48.320\nHey!\n\n01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.320\nWe got gold.\n\n01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320\nWe got silver.\n\n01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320\nWe got stories.\n\n01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.320\nWe got...\n\n01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.320\nWait, what?\n\n01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.320\nGive it up.\n\n01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.320\nGive what up?\n\n01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.320\nGold silver stories.\n\n01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.320\nLet me start over.\n\n01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:02.320\nWe got gold for our own purposes.\n\n01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.320\nWe have silver for our own purposes.\n\n01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.320\nI don't have any gold.\n\n01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.320\nDo you have any gold?\n\n01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.320\nGive it up.\n\n01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.320\nYou're robbing us?\n\n01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.320\nYeah, you're in our turf, boys.\n\n01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.320\nSome rough gnomes.\n\n01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.320\nAll right.\n\n01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.320\nOkay.\n\n01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.320\nHow close am I to this robot baby?\n\n01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.320\nYou're right up next to it.\n\n01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:22.320\nDescribe the hole in the robot baby's chest.\n\n01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:29.320\nIt looks like it's meant to fit some sort of maybe like a saucer-shaped dick.\n\n01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.320\nDick.\n\n01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.320\nYeah.\n\n01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.320\nOkay.\n\n01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.320\nI just want to be near that baby in case I want to grab that baby again.\n\n01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.320\nI'm not going to fuck the baby, everybody.\n\n01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:51.320\nOkay, guys, guys, guys, I swear to God, I promise you that if we fight, you'll lose.\n\n01:28:51.320 --> 01:29:01.320\nBut if we don't fight, I will give you...\n\n01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.320\nWhat do I have wealth-wise?\n\n01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.320\nWhat do I have?\n\n01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.320\nI don't know.\n\n01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.320\nYou don't know?\n\n01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.320\nI'll give you 500 million gold pieces.\n\n01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:09.320\nI mean, I don't think you have any gold.\n\n01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.320\nOh, okay.\n\n01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.320\nGuys, I will give you...\n\n01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.320\nI don't have anything?\n\n01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.320\nI don't think you have gold.\n\n01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:17.320\nWe always forget to loot the people that we kill.\n\n01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.320\nYeah.\n\n01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.320\nAll right.\n\n01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.320\nHere's what I'll do.\n\n01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.320\nI'm going to give...\n\n01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:26.320\nI'm going to tell you guys a riddle, and if you answer the riddle correctly, you can\n\n01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.320\nhave everything that I have.\n\n01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.320\nOkay?\n\n01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.320\nHmm.\n\n01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.320\nEverything.\n\n01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.320\nAll my possessions, all my clothes, everything.\n\n01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:34.320\nDo you want to hear...\n\n01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.320\nDo you want to do the riddle?\n\n01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.320\nWell, I just want to take all your stuff anyway.\n\n01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.320\nYou don't want to do the riddle?\n\n01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.320\nBecause if you don't do the riddle, we got to fight.\n\n01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:44.320\nWell, this...\n\n01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.320\nIf you do the riddle and you guess it right, you could get it without a fight.\n\n01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:52.320\nThis is Bill Mardigans, the town of cigarettes and riddles.\n\n01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:55.320\nYeah, so don't you want to do a riddle?\n\n01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:57.320\nI guess I do.\n\n01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.320\nAll right.\n\n01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.320\nAll right.\n\n01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.320\nSo, all right.\n\n01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:13.320\nWhat is smaller than a human but looks like a bloody skeleton?\n\n01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:24.320\nSmaller than a...\n\n01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.320\nA bloody skeleton of a half...\n\n01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.320\nLike a fucked up...\n\n01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.320\nWait, what?\n\n01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.320\nSorry, I'm sorry.\n\n01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.320\nA bloody skeleton of a half...\n\n01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.320\nNo, no, that's not true.\n\n01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.320\nNo.\n\n01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.320\nThat's not right.\n\n01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320\nSo, let's...\n\n01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.320\nWe're going to go past.\n\n01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.320\nOh, no.\n\n01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.320\nYou could try, though.\n\n01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.320\nWait, what?\n\n01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.320\nNo, no.\n\n01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.320\nOkay.\n\n01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.320\nWell, you see...\n\n01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.320\nGive us all stuff.\n\n01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.320\nWhat's the answer to the riddle?\n\n01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.320\nOh.\n\n01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.320\nDamn!\n\n01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:52.320\nKick their ass!\n\n01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.320\nFlaming sword, cleave attack!\n\n01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.320\nSay, which one?\n\n01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:03.320\nI go at the first two closest green scarf where I nose and I go for a cleave on them with my great sword.\n\n01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.320\nAll right.\n\n01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:10.320\nYou leap towards with them with a flaming great sword with the intent to cleave, but as you do so, the two flanking,\n\n01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:15.320\nthe guy who's been talking loose, they're light crossbows into your flesh!\n\n01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:19.320\nLight crossbows.\n\n01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:23.320\nOne of them misses, but the other does not miss, and it hits you.\n\n01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:27.320\nDealing some seven damage.\n\n01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:33.320\nAt any rate, you launch yourselves towards the gnomes and slash.\n\n01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:39.320\nYou slash the other one's neck, and his head pops clean off.\n\n01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:41.320\nThe other one you just hit.\n\n01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.320\nLet's see how much damage you've done.\n\n01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.320\nSo one guy's just done.\n\n01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.320\nYeah, he's done.\n\n01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.320\nYou got critical hit.\n\n01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.320\nWhat's your damage again?\n\n01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.320\nSorry, everybody.\n\n01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.320\nIt's 2d8, is it?\n\n01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:54.320\nIt's 2d8 plus 7.\n\n01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:55.320\nOh, wait.\n\n01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:57.320\nNo, that was just 2d8.\n\n01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:01.320\nIt deals 11 damage to the other one, and he clutches his neck wound.\n\n01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:06.320\nHe's also got hit in the neck because they're the same height.\n\n01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.320\nHe just kind of falls down bleeding, I guess.\n\n01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320\nHe's not dead, though.\n\n01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:12.320\nLet's put it on Mulrange's turn.\n\n01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.320\nYou got your bow out.\n\n01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:19.320\nYeah, I have my speedy longbow, and I use that to attack one of the other gnomes.\n\n01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:25.320\nYou fire it at one of the other gnomes, like the one that was talking, or the one that's bleeding, or the other ones.\n\n01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:29.320\nI'll fire at one of the ones that came in from behind.\n\n01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.320\nThe guy that's not hit yet.\n\n01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:36.320\nYou fire the arrow, but something seems to have gone wrong.\n\n01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:41.320\nYour bowstring snaps in the bow, and the arrow just kind of flies off.\n\n01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:46.320\nIt hits you in the eye, but not the tip, like just the side of the shaft.\n\n01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.320\nHits you right in the left eye near bowstring snaps.\n\n01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:53.320\nIt's going to take at least a turn to heal that.\n\n01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.320\nSounds about right.\n\n01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.320\nSorry.\n\n01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.320\nThat one was a critical fail, yeah.\n\n01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:04.320\nSo, putting it at, uh, Christopher's turn, yeah?\n\n01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:11.320\nI thought the smoke bomb, like a ninja, for cover, and then I jump and grab the baby.\n\n01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:20.320\nUnleashing a torrent of acrid smoke into the room, you use this cover to grab the baby.\n\n01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.320\nWhat you do, now you hold it in your hands.\n\n01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.320\nUh, and then I hide.\n\n01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:28.320\nYou retreat into the shadows.\n\n01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.320\nHe's a rogue.\n\n01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:35.320\nYou're the Steve Buscemi of this, uh, skirmish.\n\n01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:43.320\nSo that's a high cause fear.\n\n01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:49.320\nThat's what it'll look like if I'm successful.\n\n01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:55.320\nAll right, so the two guys that were already in the room before you came in, they just cower in fear,\n\n01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:00.320\nbut the rest of the people aren't really affected, other than the dead guy.\n\n01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:03.320\nAll right!\n\n01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.320\nThey're just cowering in fear.\n\n01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:07.320\nSo the first three guys that were there, it doesn't affect you.\n\n01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.320\nYeah.\n\n01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.320\nBut the ones that were already afraid.\n\n01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:13.320\nThe bleeding guy with green scarf and non-bleedy guy with green scarf, they're affected by it.\n\n01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.320\nThey weren't affected by it.\n\n01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.320\nGreen scarves weren't affected.\n\n01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.320\nOh, so the other guys were?\n\n01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:18.320\nYes.\n\n01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:22.320\nThese green scarves guys are so badass.\n\n01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:28.320\nSo the rest of them, the guys that are scared, they just cower normal style.\n\n01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.320\nBut the cactus bunch guy that's alive, he starts reloading his...\n\n01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.320\nOh yeah, I didn't even mention that.\n\n01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:39.320\nHe goes, you will not mess with the cactus bunch!\n\n01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.320\nA guy in the front row called that.\n\n01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:42.320\nThank you.\n\n01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.320\nThat guy's the guy I'm playing this whole thing for.\n\n01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:46.320\nI love it.\n\n01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.320\nThe whole reason I do it.\n\n01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.320\nOh shit, you guys, this is fucking KB!\n\n01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.320\nThis is the cactus bunch.\n\n01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.320\nK?\n\n01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.320\nThey spell cactus with a K, you guys.\n\n01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.320\nTwo.\n\n01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.320\nTwo Ks, as a matter of fact.\n\n01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.320\nYeah, this is fucking cactus bunch from Whittier.\n\n01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:05.320\nYou sliced this guy's head off and now we won't forget you guys.\n\n01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:08.320\nThe cactus bunches don't remember a face.\n\n01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.320\nI mean, we do.\n\n01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.320\nWe also don't talk good.\n\n01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.320\nOr spell cactus, right?\n\n01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.320\nThe one guy starts reloading his crossbow and the chatty guy,\n\n01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:24.320\nhe lunges at a Sharpie with a knife drawn.\n\n01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:28.320\nAnd just like that, that's how his attack goes.\n\n01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:34.320\nHe kind of just goes at you and he stabs the air next to you.\n\n01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.320\nDoesn't do anything.\n\n01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.320\nThe rest of the guys are just scared in the corner.\n\n01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:43.320\nDo you have a comeback that sounded like you had something to say?\n\n01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.320\nI said sup.\n\n01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.320\nSup.\n\n01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.320\nNot much, sup with you.\n\n01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.320\nWell, we can just do this?\n\n01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.320\nI don't know.\n\n01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.320\nWhy not, right?\n\n01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:54.320\nCan we stop fighting?\n\n01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.320\nOh, oh, I thought you were just talking to me.\n\n01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.320\nOh, no.\n\n01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.320\nWell, whatever.\n\n01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.320\nI'm talking to the guys trying to stab me.\n\n01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:01.320\nIt's fine, it's fine.\n\n01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:04.320\nSharpie, you don't talk to KB, man.\n\n01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.320\nCactus bunch slice you.\n\n01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:10.320\nThey also take your bandana off and kick you in the chest.\n\n01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:13.320\nPutting it at a quark start.\n\n01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:16.320\nIs my storage still flaming?\n\n01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.320\nYeah.\n\n01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:20.320\nWhere am I in relationship to the guy that's the chatty one,\n\n01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.320\nthe guy that came in the door?\n\n01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:23.320\nHe's behind you at this point.\n\n01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.320\nHe ran at Sharpie.\n\n01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.320\nIs he close enough to the bleeding guy for a clean attack?\n\n01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.320\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.320\nThat guy's healing himself.\n\n01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:36.320\nOkay, well, I go up to the guy that's bleeding through the neck,\n\n01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:44.320\nand I take the sword and go straight down from his head\n\n01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.320\nand try to just bifurcate him.\n\n01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.320\nJust to slice him in half.\n\n01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.320\nBifurcate him.\n\n01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.320\nMan, this is my figuralization.\n\n01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.320\nWhat was your word earlier?\n\n01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:55.320\nJust general, what was your word?\n\n01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.320\nRegularization in the chat.\n\n01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.320\nRegularization.\n\n01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:59.320\nThanks.\n\n01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.320\nI'm going to bifurcate him.\n\n01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:03.320\nSwinging with your sword.\n\n01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.320\nOh, shit.\n\n01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.320\nYou bifurcate him in tune.\n\n01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:10.320\nOh, fuck.\n\n01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:15.320\nAnd that was also critical, yeah.\n\n01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.320\nWow, I'm on a roll.\n\n01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.320\nI guess you are.\n\n01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.320\nI light a cigarette and just enjoy the moment.\n\n01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:26.320\nThat put a mole rain's turn.\n\n01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.320\nAm I still injured from the Bowen?\n\n01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.320\nNo, but your bow, you'd have to use a weapon other than your bow\n\n01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.320\nunless you wanted to restrain it.\n\n01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:41.320\nI'll take my sword and attack the talky guy that hasn't been injured yet.\n\n01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.320\nGrabbing your sword, you swing at the talky guy,\n\n01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:47.320\nbut you miss him.\n\n01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:50.320\nHe seems to sway back with some words.\n\n01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:55.320\nOh, you got him swing with a different sword than that.\n\n01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:00.320\nHe's got his cactus butt your fucking tongue.\n\n01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.320\nYeah, putting it at a Christopher's turn.\n\n01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.320\nI emerge from the shadows just enough to miss my face\n\n01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:07.320\nand the creepy baby's face.\n\n01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.320\nAnd I hold a vial of acid over the baby.\n\n01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.320\nAnd I say, all right, motherfuckers, everybody be cool.\n\n01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:15.320\nAnd I try to sound like Samuel L. Jackson when I do it.\n\n01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.320\nAnd I succeed.\n\n01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.320\nSounding like Samuel L. Jackson.\n\n01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.320\nThe rest of the people don't...\n\n01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:27.320\nOh, no, no, no. If you're going to do it, commit to it.\n\n01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:31.320\nI want to hear this Samuel L. Jackson impression.\n\n01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.320\nI'll pass, I'll pass.\n\n01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.320\nYou're kind of doing it there.\n\n01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.320\nI'm tired of these motherfucking gnomes.\n\n01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:42.320\nMy motherfucking Yomiji plane or whatever.\n\n01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:45.320\nYomiji plane.\n\n01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:49.320\nSo you do that and those cowering gnomes that are all feared up,\n\n01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:53.320\nthey're all like, no, don't.\n\n01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:58.320\nBut the chatty gnomes like, man, I don't give a fuck.\n\n01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.320\nOh, shit.\n\n01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.320\nWe're like arch enemies.\n\n01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.320\nNo, we're like Pock and Biggie, that guy, man.\n\n01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:04.320\nWe're going to do it.\n\n01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:08.320\nAlso, I see you hiding.\n\n01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:10.320\nI see you frontin'.\n\n01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.320\nOh, shit.\n\n01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:17.320\nNow it's personal.\n\n01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.320\nPut it at a...\n\n01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.320\nSharpies.\n\n01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:24.320\nOh, this is business.\n\n01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:30.320\nShocking grass, motherfucker.\n\n01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:34.320\nYou grab him shockingly, but he manages to sway back\n\n01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:37.320\nwith some chatty words like, oh, man, your hand's so electric.\n\n01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:39.320\nI don't care.\n\n01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.320\nShit.\n\n01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:43.320\nFuck.\n\n01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.320\nHe sways back and then he lunges again towards you\n\n01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.320\nand he tries to whip his knife at your face.\n\n01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.320\nMe?\n\n01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.320\nYep, he just throws it at you, though.\n\n01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:52.320\nShit.\n\n01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:57.320\nHe done hit you in the face.\n\n01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.320\nDealing.\n\n01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:02.320\nThere's a critical hit, son.\n\n01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:03.320\nDealing.\n\n01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.320\n13 damage.\n\n01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.320\nI'll leave it to you to know if that means I'm dead.\n\n01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:10.320\nLet's find out.\n\n01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.320\nWhat's your max health?\n\n01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:15.320\nMy max health is...\n\n01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.320\nI'll tell you later.\n\n01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.320\nIt seems relevant.\n\n01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.320\n42.\n\n01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.320\nIt's 42.\n\n01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:25.320\nNah, you're probably at about 12 or 13.\n\n01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:29.320\nBut you stagger with your face all bled up.\n\n01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:34.320\nNow he's disarmed, his knife's in your face.\n\n01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.320\nPutting it at Quark's turn.\n\n01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:40.320\nI run over to Sharpie, take the knife out of his face\n\n01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.320\nand plunge it in that motherfucker.\n\n01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:48.320\nAnd I put it in the same spot in his face that Sharpie got it.\n\n01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:52.320\nOr you would, but you trip and fall on Sharpie's face blood\n\n01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.320\nin the ground.\n\n01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:58.320\nThe knife just goes skittering out the door.\n\n01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.320\nJeff, are you doing something awesome?\n\n01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.320\nWho's Jeff?\n\n01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.320\nWho's Jeff?\n\n01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.320\nQuark.\n\n01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.320\nExperience points.\n\n01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.320\nIt's not today.\n\n01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:14.320\nCan I get myself righted or is that not my turn?\n\n01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.320\nWait, what?\n\n01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:18.320\nCan I get myself back on my feet or does it move on?\n\n01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.320\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.320\nYou're out of moves.\n\n01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.320\nOkay.\n\n01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:22.320\nPutting it at Mulraine's turn.\n\n01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:25.320\nSo the knife is now out of...\n\n01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.320\nYeah, it flew out of the bar.\n\n01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:31.320\nOkay, so I'm going to take my whisper bow\n\n01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.320\nand hopefully be successful this time\n\n01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:37.320\nin trying to attack the gnome that just threw the knife.\n\n01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:40.320\nAttacking at the gnome, you shoot him right in the throat.\n\n01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:44.320\nDamn!\n\n01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.320\nAnd he takes eight damage.\n\n01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.320\nAll right.\n\n01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:50.320\nChoking on his own blood, he falls to the floor going\n\n01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.320\nCactus.\n\n01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:55.320\nPrickles.\n\n01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:59.320\nStab all in the end.\n\n01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:02.320\nAnybody get that?\n\n01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:05.320\nIt's just some cactus bunch of bullshit.\n\n01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.320\nIs he dead?\n\n01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.320\nYeah.\n\n01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:10.320\nSo we got all the green scars, cactus bunch, guys?\n\n01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:15.320\nThe other gnomes cower in fear still.\n\n01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.320\nI know, the fight's not over though, right?\n\n01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.320\nEveryone's dead except for people that are cowering in fear.\n\n01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.320\nSome people like that.\n\n01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:25.320\nIt's pretty over.\n\n01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:26.320\nChristopher?\n\n01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:29.320\nYeah, so I hold the violet acid over the baby\n\n01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:31.320\nand I slowly walk out towards the door.\n\n01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:35.320\nI go, all right, well, I have nothing else to say.\n\n01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.320\nYou sure don't.\n\n01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.320\nIn his stead, I have a few words.\n\n01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:45.320\nI can't see anything right now because as you can see,\n\n01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.320\nand I can't, my face has been stabbed.\n\n01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:52.320\nBut I will tell you what I can see.\n\n01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:57.320\nI see a day when people don't fuck with each other.\n\n01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:00.320\nMaybe I'm an old dreamer.\n\n01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:03.320\nI know what happened here today didn't have to happen.\n\n01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:05.320\nWe got a little out of control.\n\n01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.320\nWe wanted to steal your baby.\n\n01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.320\nWe stood down.\n\n01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.320\nWe gave you baby back.\n\n01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:11.320\nSome other fuckers came in, fucked with us.\n\n01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:13.320\nEveryone's dead now.\n\n01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:16.320\nMy name's face bleeding, face bleed.\n\n01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:18.320\nNot gonna give you my real name.\n\n01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:21.320\nI want you to remember me as the face bleed guy.\n\n01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.320\nI can't see you.\n\n01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.320\nI can't feel you.\n\n01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.320\nI'll never sympathize with you.\n\n01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.320\nIf I ever have to hear the name of this bar again,\n\n01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:30.320\nit burns to the ground.\n\n01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:36.320\nFor now, be content, for it to be coated in blood.\n\n01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:39.320\nYou stabbed my face.\n\n01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.320\nQuark.\n\n01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:46.320\nI go over there and take their scarves.\n\n01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.320\nThat, that.\n\n01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.320\nOh, yeah, and I loot them.\n\n01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.320\nThank you.\n\n01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.320\nWait, what?\n\n01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:57.320\nI go over there and take all their shit.\n\n01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.320\nAnd I put what?\n\n01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.320\nYeah, gold everything.\n\n01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.320\nI put one scarf around my head,\n\n01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:04.320\nlike, like, like Ralph Maccio and Crotty Kid.\n\n01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:07.320\nAnd I put two around my leg, like two Scott Bayos.\n\n01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:10.320\nJesus.\n\n01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.320\nI'm like, and I, and I, and I go,\n\n01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:12.320\nyou want these back?\n\n01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:16.320\nYou got to claim them from the new cactus bunch.\n\n01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:19.320\nI'll tell you what, I don't know if anyone's listening to me\n\n01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:21.320\nbecause I can't see because my face is stabbed.\n\n01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:24.320\nBut I will tell you something that's tragically ironic\n\n01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.320\nabout what you're inspired here today.\n\n01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.320\nWe didn't come in here caring about finance.\n\n01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.320\nTo the point where we didn't have any.\n\n01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.320\nThese guys came in and asked for our gold.\n\n01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.320\nWe didn't have any.\n\n01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.320\nDoes that suggest anything to you?\n\n01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:37.320\nWe lived in a world without, without currency.\n\n01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:44.320\nFrom now on, we're robbing everyone.\n\n01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.320\nMulraine, go to the, you know,\n\n01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.320\nequivalent of the cash register.\n\n01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:51.320\nI can't, I got blood in my face.\n\n01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:53.320\nI got a knife wound in my face.\n\n01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.320\nI can't see anything.\n\n01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.320\nI just want to rob everyone here.\n\n01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.320\nIf you can hear me and you're not dead,\n\n01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:02.320\nyou're lucky, but you're broke.\n\n01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:03.320\nMulraine, Mulraine.\n\n01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:05.320\nIs there a cash register in the place?\n\n01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:06.320\nThere's money places.\n\n01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.320\nOkay.\n\n01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:08.320\nSo you go there.\n\n01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.320\nI say, Chris de Burgh, go to the cowering guys\n\n01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.320\nbecause you're a thief.\n\n01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.320\nGo get those guys.\n\n01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.320\nI'll rob the dead.\n\n01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.320\nOn it.\n\n01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:16.320\nOn it.\n\n01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.320\nSome of you are going to be left alive.\n\n01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:20.320\nI want you to tell your friends about us.\n\n01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:21.320\nWe love money.\n\n01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.320\nWe love killing people.\n\n01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:24.320\nWe love robbing people.\n\n01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:27.320\nWe love money.\n\n01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:30.320\nIt's not, it's nothing new.\n\n01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.320\nYou'll remember it.\n\n01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:35.320\nI ran it down just in case they forget.\n\n01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:36.320\nYeah.\n\n01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:39.320\nWe're going to leave it on a note here for you.\n\n01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:41.320\nIt's the same old songs.\n\n01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:43.320\nWe love money.\n\n01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:45.320\nWe love robbing people.\n\n01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:46.320\nWhat do we get Spencer?\n\n01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:47.320\nOkay.\n\n01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:52.320\nSo Mulraine in the cash till finds 300 gold pieces.\n\n01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:54.320\nYeah.\n\n01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:56.320\nChris de Burgh tries to mug these or tries to rob these people,\n\n01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.320\nbut they don't seem to have very much.\n\n01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.320\nYou get about 17 silver.\n\n01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.320\nYou were robbing the dead.\n\n01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.320\nI was robbing.\n\n01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.320\nCactus bunch.\n\n01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:05.320\nCactus bunch.\n\n01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.320\nAll of them are dead.\n\n01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.320\nYou already got their green bandanas,\n\n01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:11.320\nbut they also have 120 gold between the two of,\n\n01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.320\nor three of them.\n\n01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:15.320\nAnd one of them has a strange stick\n\n01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:17.320\ncolored with yellow and red paint.\n\n01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.320\nWho knows what that is?\n\n01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:20.320\nOoh.\n\n01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:26.320\nHe also has a card that says cactus bunch.\n\n01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.320\nAll right.\n\n01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.320\nI go over to Sharpie.\n\n01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.320\nI don't know much about looking at those sticks.\n\n01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.320\nDo you feel any magic on this stick?\n\n01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:35.320\nI got my blood is in my eyes.\n\n01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:37.320\nCan you put it in my hand?\n\n01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.320\nYeah.\n\n01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.320\nPut it in your hand.\n\n01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.320\nAll right.\n\n01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.320\nI'm feeling it.\n\n01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:43.320\nDo I have a...\n\n01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:47.320\nDo I have knowledge?\n\n01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.320\nArcana.\n\n01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.320\nCome on.\n\n01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:52.320\nYou sense it arcana-ly,\n\n01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:55.320\nbut you don't turn anything up.\n\n01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:56.320\nAll right.\n\n01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.320\nIt seems like a stick.\n\n01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.320\nI wouldn't throw it away.\n\n01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:01.320\nI don't think people walk around with them\n\n01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.320\nunless they're valuable.\n\n01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:04.320\nI think maybe when we...\n\n01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320\nHow big is the stick?\n\n01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:08.320\nIt's maybe three inches.\n\n01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.320\nIt's a little stick.\n\n01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.320\nAll right.\n\n01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:12.320\nSo we got the stick.\n\n01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:13.320\nWe got some money.\n\n01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:14.320\nYou want me to hang onto this?\n\n01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:15.320\nHang onto it.\n\n01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:16.320\nI think, you know...\n\n01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.320\nLet me try something.\n\n01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:22.320\nAnd I thrust it and I put my magic energy into it.\n\n01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:25.320\nAnd I pointed at the wall.\n\n01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:27.320\nNothing.\n\n01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:30.320\nI'm not going to call that a deal breaker.\n\n01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.320\nI just wanted to make sure that...\n\n01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.320\nSome of these things, they'll make a dinosaur.\n\n01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.320\nAll right.\n\n01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:36.320\nDo we have the blueprints for the baby?\n\n01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:37.320\nDo you guys want to pawn this?\n\n01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.320\nYeah.\n\n01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.320\nWe got both of those things.\n\n01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:41.320\nWe got this robot baby.\n\n01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:43.320\nWe got to find out how to work that thing.\n\n01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:44.320\nWe got the blueprints.\n\n01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.320\nI look at the blueprints and see if there's anything\n\n01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.320\nabout that disc thing, the hole in it,\n\n01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.320\nand see if there's anything that...\n\n01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.320\nThe stick thing?\n\n01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.320\nYeah.\n\n01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:53.320\nIt looks like there's a little arrow\n\n01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.320\nthat points to the whole cavity.\n\n01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.320\nAnd then there's some gnomish words,\n\n01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:01.320\nand it's all like power, power, power.\n\n01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:03.320\nIt just says power three times.\n\n01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.320\nWhat should go wrong, really?\n\n01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:07.320\nWe don't have the disc to put in the thing.\n\n01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:08.320\nI look around for the disc in the room\n\n01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.320\nand see if there's anything to put in there.\n\n01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.320\nNo dice.\n\n01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.320\nI mean...\n\n01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.320\nThen how do you know, man?\n\n01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:18.320\nI rolled the dice.\n\n01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.320\nA three-inch thing won't fit in there.\n\n01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.320\nNo, it's saucer-shaped.\n\n01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:22.320\nHow big around is the hole?\n\n01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.320\nYeah, you know, like a fifth-shape, cup-shape size\n\n01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:27.320\nbigger than a stick.\n\n01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.320\nCan I talk to the scared gnomes\n\n01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.320\nand see if they can give us information\n\n01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.320\nabout what to put in the robot?\n\n01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.320\nYeah, they're just cowering.\n\n01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:37.320\nAsk them whatever you want.\n\n01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.320\nI'm going to ask them what we need to put in the robot.\n\n01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.320\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.320\nWe didn't figure that part out.\n\n01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:48.320\nWe just bought these on the gnome store.\n\n01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:52.320\nI was going to say the internet.\n\n01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.320\nAll right, we need a cliffhanger here, you guys.\n\n01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:57.320\nFuck.\n\n01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:01.320\nI don't care how long it takes.\n\n01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.320\nI don't care what we have to do.\n\n01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:08.320\nYou're going to get used to seeing my face\n\n01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:12.320\nwith its gaping knife wound.\n\n01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:16.320\nYou got to give us more information than that.\n\n01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.320\nIs the three-inch stick on the plans at all?\n\n01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.320\nNo.\n\n01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.320\nNope.\n\n01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.320\nAll right.\n\n01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.320\nYou bought a baby.\n\n01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.320\nYou don't know how to power it?\n\n01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.320\nNo.\n\n01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:28.320\nWhy did you buy this baby?\n\n01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.320\nWhat do these things do?\n\n01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.320\nWhat's the purpose of these things?\n\n01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.320\nThey're supposed to, you know, be cool.\n\n01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:38.320\nLike they serve drinks.\n\n01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.320\nWhy does it have to be a baby, then?\n\n01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.320\nI mean, it's not really a...\n\n01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:45.320\nIt's like a Kirby?\n\n01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:48.320\nIt does kind of look like a baby.\n\n01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:49.320\nSo you have a little baby rope\n\n01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:51.320\nthat just to do stuff for you?\n\n01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:53.320\nOh, no, man.\n\n01:49:53.320

and everything,\n\n01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:00.320\nbut we're taking that baby\n\n01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.320\nand we're going to get the hell out of here.\n\n01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.320\nWell, we got it now, yeah.\n\n01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.320\nYeah.\n\n01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:06.320\nAll right.\n\n01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:07.320\nLet's go, guys.\n\n01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.320\nWe walk out of the bar\n\n01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.320\nand it's the slow-mo, stupid shot in every movie,\n\n01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:12.320\nlike the right stuff and everything,\n\n01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:14.320\nand we're walking down the main drag\n\n01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:17.320\nof Bill Martin against all four breasts.\n\n01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:18.320\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:50:18.320 -->

working?\n\n01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:23.320\nIs he mobile?\n\n01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:24.320\nNo, it's not turned on.\n\n01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.320\nBut then we slowly start running, right?\n\n01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.320\nLike we look badass for a second,\n\n01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.320\nbut then we're going to really, really...\n\n01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.320\nWe're going to start running.\n\n01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.320\nRight.\n\n01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.320\nBecause we didn't tie them up or anything.\n\n01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.320\nWe're going to just get out of here.\n\n01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:36.320\nOkay, no.\n\n01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:37.320\nWe're walking away\n\n01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:40.320\nand we're doing the straight-to-camera walk\n\n01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.320\nand slow-mo.\n\n01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:42.320\nAnd then...\n\n01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:43.320\nIs my sword still flaming?\n\n01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:44.320\nYeah.\n\n01:50:44.320 -->

01:51:12.320\nand they called it the fucking top.\n\n01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:14.320\nThey had a heart in their heart, man.\n\n01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:15.320\nWe're bad people.\n\n01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.320\nWell, they go put the milk.\n\n01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.320\nYou're just a big monologue about\n\n01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:19.320\nhow we're bad guys now.\n\n01:51:19.320 -->

everybody.\n\n01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.320\nSo just, just live in terror,\n\n01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:14.320\na vague terror.\n\n01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:15.320\nNot like a...\n\n01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:17.320\nJust a vague terror.\n\n01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.320\nLike, don't...\n\n01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.320\nLike, go about your normal business.\n\n01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:20.320\nBe happy.\n\n01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:21.320\nFall in love.\n\n01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:22.320\nHave children.\n\n01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:24.320\nBut always have underneath there,\n\n01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:25.320\nlike a meta-traumatization.\n\n01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:27.320\nAnd I'll explain to you what Christmas is.\n\n01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:29.320\nAnd then I'll skin everybody.\n\n01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.320\nSo just, just live in terror,\n\n01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:32.320\nlike underneath there,\n\n01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:34.320\nlike a meta-channel of terror.\n\n01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.320\nLike the idea that I would come,\n\n01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.320\nlike I would be there,\n\n01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:38.320\nand I would hurt you.\n\n01:52:38.320 -->

01:52:43.320\nThen we start running away.\n\n01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.320\nNow we're cool.\n\n01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:45.320\nNow we're cool.\n\n01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:46.320\nBecause,\n\n01:52:46.320
