WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.440
It's real pro shit tonight you guys. I'm so fucking tired. I just got off a plane and oh my god. All right, here we go

00:18.440 --> 00:20.120
It's gonna be a good one

00:20.120 --> 00:33.720
Because I just don't care here we go

00:33.720 --> 00:39.320
Hello one and all, welcome once again to Nerdmelt Theater, Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California.

00:39.320 --> 00:58.320
Harmontown is now in session. Fifth Bank, howl. Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:58.320 --> 01:08.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Why, why, why, I always ask this, why, why so many of you? What's the deal? Game of Thrones is over.

01:08.320 --> 01:17.320
Isn't there one more? That was it last time? Yeah, you know I was at a town. No, what was I? I don't fucking know man.

01:17.320 --> 01:26.320
Yeah, get caught up man. Yeah. Really? All right, so movie update. Let's talk about Edge of Tomorrow in a second.

01:26.320 --> 01:39.320
I went and saw Edge of Tomorrow tonight and but there was a trailer. I've never been more excited about a movie that didn't involve people blowing up.

01:39.320 --> 01:49.320
Robert Downey Jr. is gonna play Robert DeVall's son in a movie about a lawyer that goes back home and Robert DeVall is, you can see this trailer?

01:49.320 --> 01:58.320
No. Every trailer I saw for the last two movies I saw with your Godzilla and Edge of Tomorrow, every trailer was about robots and shit blowing up.

01:58.320 --> 02:05.320
Which is my, that's what you need to get a rise out of me but I was like, Robert Downey Jr. is like, ah, he's an asshole and I'm an asshole.

02:05.320 --> 02:12.320
I get people off. I'm a lawyer and then it's like, ah, your mom passed away or whatever and then he goes back home and it's Robert DeVall's dad.

02:12.320 --> 02:20.320
And his dad's a judge. I'm fucking in man. I hope that's not a shitty movie.

02:20.320 --> 02:25.320
Whoever wrote that movie, if you got those actors to be in your movie, Robert Downey Jr. played Robert DeVall's son.

02:25.320 --> 02:30.320
Robert DeVall is my favorite living actor. It's gonna be good. I'm signing up for that.

02:30.320 --> 02:36.320
But I was there for Edge of Tomorrow which is fucking awesome. Go see it.

02:36.320 --> 02:43.320
The last half hour is like, whatever, apparently we can't fully commit to a time-bending action movie.

02:43.320 --> 02:48.320
Apparently for the last half hour you definitely just have to go, okay, now cut the red wire or the blue wire.

02:48.320 --> 02:52.320
I'm not spoiling it. There's no bomb in it. I'm just saying.

02:52.320 --> 02:56.320
But it's pretty profound, that movie. We're just talking about in the green room.

02:56.320 --> 03:02.320
I'm very accurate for everyone to say it's Groundhog Day, sci-fi.

03:02.320 --> 03:09.320
But the thing that you don't know when you hear that is that I think it's like a sequel to Groundhog Day.

03:09.320 --> 03:15.320
Like, it picks up. It's the James Cameron, like Ridley Scott made Groundhog Day.

03:15.320 --> 03:20.320
And then this is the James Cameron. This is Groundhog's Days.

03:20.320 --> 03:28.320
And that doesn't mean more Groundhogs and more days. It means something more important than that.

03:28.320 --> 03:33.320
It means something more profound about our relationship with time and mortality and stuff.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.320
It's actually really, really fucking cool.

03:36.320 --> 03:42.320
Also, I was very happy, as I said backstage, it reminded me that I've always liked Tom Cruise.

03:42.320 --> 03:48.320
He's a fucking great movie star and he went nuts and he believes in weird boogie boogie boogies.

03:48.320 --> 03:53.320
But he's fucking badass in that movie. I like Tom Cruise again.

03:53.320 --> 04:00.320
Wow. Alright, we like Tom Cruise again. Tom Cruise, if you're listening...

04:00.320 --> 04:06.320
I would say he almost certainly listens to this.

04:06.320 --> 04:11.320
This is our record. I don't know, I've come up here with nothing on my notepad, but that's really...

04:11.320 --> 04:15.320
As far as me having something on my notepad, I had...

04:15.320 --> 04:25.320
Oh no, it says RSJ as Robert DeVall's son. I'm assuming that means RD.

04:25.320 --> 04:30.320
They're adjacent on the keyboard. I'm really excited about that.

04:30.320 --> 04:34.320
That's going to be a new on Golden Pond. Father and son shit drives me crazy.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.320
I fucking love it. The idea of Robert DeVall being...

04:37.320 --> 04:41.320
He's a judge, but Robert DeVall... Robert Johnny Jr. is a lawyer. Fuck you.

04:41.320 --> 04:46.320
There's no bad... I'm going to die. I can't wait to see this movie.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.320
There's no bad Robert DeVall movie for my money either.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.320
There's no bad Robert Johnny Jr.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.320
He wasn't true grip for fuck's sake man, either.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.320
Rooster! Shut the pieces up here, Rooster!

04:55.320 --> 05:00.320
There's only so many mainstream things I approve of. Oxygen, alcohol...

05:00.320 --> 05:03.320
And RSJ.

05:03.320 --> 05:06.320
And Iron Man.

05:06.320 --> 05:09.320
I wanted to talk a little bit about linguistics. Do you mind?

05:09.320 --> 05:13.320
I fuck no. I insist.

05:13.320 --> 05:17.320
I feel like...

05:17.320 --> 05:23.320
We got to make Spencer up for this conversation, because I want to catch him off guard and I want to talk about something.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.320
Can we just have Spencer come out early and just have him be here?

05:26.320 --> 05:29.320
I think he should come out before us.

05:29.320 --> 05:35.320
Spencer Crichton.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.320
You cool sitting there?

05:41.320 --> 05:43.320
I got caught in a nail.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.320
Was it sharp? Did it cut you?

05:46.320 --> 05:48.320
No, it was the head.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.320
Pull that nail out. That's really dangerous.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.320
The head'll fuck you up.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.320
Now I'm your king.

05:56.320 --> 05:59.320
You said that to the nail?

05:59.320 --> 06:03.320
No, he's doing Excalibur. He's a king of a really tiny kingdom.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.320
Was he talking to us, or is he talking to the nail?

06:05.320 --> 06:06.320
I think he's saying to all of us.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.320
He's our king.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.320
It's a sword in the stone kind of mythology going on.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.320
Anyone who believes it, I'll take it.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.320
It's not rule anybody out.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.320
Unite us, motherfucker.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.320
Did you really want to talk about linguistics?

06:19.320 --> 06:21.320
Yeah.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.320
Shoot.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.320
Alright, so, I've never talked to you about this, ever.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.320
This is the thing I've noticed.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.320
Shit.

06:33.320 --> 06:37.320
It hasn't spread to Jeff, and I don't know who started it.

06:37.320 --> 06:42.320
I don't know who patient zero of this linguistic thing is.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.320
For all I know it started with me, spread to you.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.320
For all I know it started with you, spread to me.

06:48.320 --> 06:53.320
Might have started with Aaron, but I've noticed it with me, you, and Aaron.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.320
Uh-huh.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.320
Starting sentences with...

06:58.320 --> 07:00.320
I mean...

07:00.320 --> 07:02.320
I mean...

07:02.320 --> 07:03.320
Who started it?

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
Who started that?

07:04.320 --> 07:06.320
That feels like a Spencerism to me.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.320
Well, see, he owns it better than us, but...

07:09.320 --> 07:12.320
I mean, yes, I don't do that.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.320
That was ill-fitting shoes.

07:15.320 --> 07:21.320
Okay, so, do you guys remember episode one of, blah, blah, blah, the sleepy candy near?

07:21.320 --> 07:22.320
Yeah.

07:22.320 --> 07:30.320
Colin, the sleepy candy near, is someone from which I derive a lot of my vocal regularizations.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.320
Regularizations.

07:32.320 --> 07:39.320
Yeah, such as regularizations.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.320
That happens.

07:41.320 --> 07:45.320
Yeah, but yeah, no, I think that he does that in...

07:45.320 --> 07:48.320
I don't think I did it too much, but I think that I did it more.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.320
I think you do it too.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.320
I do it a ton.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.320
That's what I'm saying.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.320
I think that I...

07:53.320 --> 07:55.320
You, me, and Aaron.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.320
That's all I know.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.320
Maybe I can picture Spencer saying it.

07:58.320 --> 08:01.320
I can also definitely say that Aaron says it a lot.

08:01.320 --> 08:04.320
And I, for all I know, Aaron started it.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.320
I think...

08:05.320 --> 08:06.320
I got it from her.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.320
I will spread it to Spencer, but for all I know, also, other way around.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.320
I have no idea.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.320
I feel like it's more of an Aaronism, actually.

08:12.320 --> 08:16.320
Because I think that predates my memory of her saying that...

08:16.320 --> 08:19.320
Do you think it's possible, Spencer, when you brought up candy near?

08:19.320 --> 08:21.320
Are you saying that you got it from him?

08:21.320 --> 08:22.320
You know that?

08:22.320 --> 08:24.320
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.320
I also wouldn't be surprised if I got it from Aaron.

08:27.320 --> 08:32.320
I mean, you know, she says it to everybody.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.320
For me, I would put the money on Aaron.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.320
It sounds like an Aaron thing.

08:36.320 --> 08:37.320
I mean, but it's not...

08:37.320 --> 08:39.320
The interesting thing about language is...

08:39.320 --> 08:41.320
Like, everybody has these bookends and things.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.320
People say...

08:42.320 --> 08:44.320
So, Aaron and I were talking about this,

08:44.320 --> 08:47.320
and we were talking about the prefix, I mean,

08:47.320 --> 08:49.320
and then the suffix, though.

08:49.320 --> 08:53.320
As in, I mean this, though?

08:53.320 --> 08:58.320
Like, that's actually a full, like, emotional thing.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.320
Like, you could point at a fire hydrant and go,

09:00.320 --> 09:02.320
I mean this, though?

09:02.320 --> 09:05.320
But the interesting thing is there's nothing in that sentence

09:05.320 --> 09:08.320
that actually syntactically conveys any information.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.320
But everything that you're...

09:10.320 --> 09:13.320
The way you're saying it, I mean this, though?

09:13.320 --> 09:16.320
The though takes away the meaning in it.

09:16.320 --> 09:20.320
So you've just subtracted the I mean from it by saying, though.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.320
Haven't you kind of sort of like...

09:22.320 --> 09:26.320
I'm not committing to this, am I?

09:26.320 --> 09:28.320
I'm not sure about that.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.320
I don't know if my brain's moving fast enough to know

09:29.320 --> 09:31.320
if I agree with that.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.320
I think what's interesting is that I mean is, like,

09:33.320 --> 09:34.320
one of many things where you go,

09:34.320 --> 09:37.320
look, listen, hey, at the end of the day,

09:37.320 --> 09:40.320
hey, well, at the end of the day.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.320
Some of the stuff we hate, because we notice it,

09:43.320 --> 09:46.320
but we all...

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
If there's anybody here who doesn't use those things,

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
great on them.

09:49.320 --> 09:53.320
But I think that also the interesting thing is that...

09:53.320 --> 09:57.320
I say I mean a lot, and I actually, like,

09:57.320 --> 10:00.320
I'm looking back at the last six months or a year of going,

10:00.320 --> 10:04.320
I mean, and I actually, like, I kind of feel the way about it

10:04.320 --> 10:06.320
like I do about Instagram.

10:06.320 --> 10:10.320
Like, I'm like, ah, yeah, I feel like actually

10:10.320 --> 10:14.320
it's bringing me closer to people.

10:14.320 --> 10:18.320
I feel like if I didn't have that canopy over my sidewalk,

10:18.320 --> 10:22.320
cafe, that the sun would be harsher.

10:22.320 --> 10:26.320
I got like, I mean, because that doesn't hurt anybody.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.320
I mean...

10:28.320 --> 10:30.320
My dad says, my dad has a tick,

10:30.320 --> 10:32.320
I think all that is is just a time stalling the tick.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.320
I mean, lots of people have that.

10:34.320 --> 10:37.320
Well, I think it's more than that.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.320
I think it's more than time stalling.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.320
Um is a time stall.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.320
The way you feel that time.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.320
If you don't mean it, then don't say it.

10:43.320 --> 10:44.320
Like, I mean, so you're saying it,

10:44.320 --> 10:46.320
you're like, you mean everything you say,

10:46.320 --> 10:48.320
whether you mean it or not.

10:48.320 --> 10:53.320
And, like, I think saying I mean is like,

10:53.320 --> 10:57.320
it's a nonce, it's not an answer.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.320
Well, you're in this space,

10:58.320 --> 11:01.320
you're saying, you're implying that, like,

11:01.320 --> 11:05.320
I just said like, like, I shouldn't have said like.

11:05.320 --> 11:08.320
I say like, like, like, like, like, like too.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.320
I stutter like all the time.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.320
I definitely think the same way it's like,

11:11.320 --> 11:13.320
it's good for all of us to do sit-ups.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.320
What could it hurt?

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
Right.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.320
Um, the I mean, which is like,

11:18.320 --> 11:20.320
like grabbing your belly and like going,

11:20.320 --> 11:22.320
this is me, this is like,

11:22.320 --> 11:24.320
it's like we're dripping into each other.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.320
The way we talk to each other,

11:26.320 --> 11:28.320
I mean, you know what I mean though?

11:28.320 --> 11:30.320
It's like, it's a shortened version of,

11:30.320 --> 11:33.320
verily I say unto thee.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.320
It's very interesting to me.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.320
I remember reading something that,

11:37.320 --> 11:39.320
it's like, what does that mean?

11:39.320 --> 11:40.320
I remember reading something.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.320
That's another one.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.320
I was like, what the fuck does that mean?

11:42.320 --> 11:43.320
Yeah.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.320
All that means is that I,

11:45.320 --> 11:47.320
I'm just reminding you that I,

11:47.320 --> 11:49.320
the last, since the last time you saw me,

11:49.320 --> 11:51.320
I haven't been just standing here like C3PO shut down.

11:51.320 --> 11:54.320
I went off, I read maybe a Newsweek article

11:54.320 --> 11:57.320
that someone tweeted me, maybe.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.320
And we don't know if that guy's information was researched,

12:00.320 --> 12:03.320
but I remember reading somewhere

12:03.320 --> 12:05.320
about communication.

12:05.320 --> 12:10.320
It's so incredibly tiny,

12:10.320 --> 12:13.320
the fraction of what we say to each other is syntactical.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.320
The actual words that we say,

12:15.320 --> 12:17.320
they mean so little.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.320
Obviously it's vital.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.320
There's absolutely no way to communicate with each other

12:22.320 --> 12:26.320
without, there's this bed of the words we say.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.320
But the words we say,

12:28.320 --> 12:31.320
there's a way I could say the word fire hydrant to you

12:31.320 --> 12:34.320
that would make you understand that I don't like you,

12:34.320 --> 12:37.320
that I've had it with you.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.320
I want to know what that is.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.320
I don't like the way you said fire hydrant.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.320
And it'd be like, what?

12:43.320 --> 12:44.320
It just said fire hydrant.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.320
And it's like, come on.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.320
When we enter into relationships with each other,

12:48.320 --> 12:50.320
we drip into each other.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.320
We're still amoeba.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.320
We're still just multicellular organisms

12:53.320 --> 12:55.320
and we vibrate air around us,

12:55.320 --> 12:58.320
but that is so interesting to me.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.320
We have these little canopies and flaps

13:01.320 --> 13:03.320
and spoilers on everything that we do.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.320
Well, the English language is very different

13:05.320 --> 13:06.320
than other languages, too.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.320
We have a lot of words for one thing,

13:08.320 --> 13:12.320
and Italians say there's one word that means tons of things.

13:12.320 --> 13:15.320
I was reading this book today,

13:15.320 --> 13:18.320
and I actually was reading a book today.

13:18.320 --> 13:22.320
This is a woman writing a letter to a German

13:22.320 --> 13:25.320
in World War II, I'm still reading those World War II

13:25.320 --> 13:28.320
detective novels, which are the best by Philip Kerr.

13:28.320 --> 13:32.320
And she says, I hope this letter's making sense.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.320
My German's not that great.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.320
Emperor Charles V said,

13:37.320 --> 13:43.320
I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women,

13:43.320 --> 13:46.320
French to men, and German to my horse.

13:46.320 --> 13:50.320
You are the horse to fucking run.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.320
That's a really interesting thing.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.320
The idea that language is never meant to be

13:56.320 --> 13:59.320
one channel or another.

13:59.320 --> 14:03.320
That was your takeaway?

14:03.320 --> 14:05.320
Was that your actual takeaway?

14:05.320 --> 14:07.320
I think her point was that she's making fun of him

14:07.320 --> 14:09.320
for being German, they're very strident, they're very direct.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.320
And she's saying, I'm from America.

14:11.320 --> 14:16.320
They'd hate you over here because you're so cynical

14:16.320 --> 14:19.320
and so direct, and things have one meaning.

14:19.320 --> 14:23.320
In American English, things have all sorts of intonations

14:23.320 --> 14:26.320
and subtexts and things like that.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.320
I just thought it meant that like,

14:28.320 --> 14:33.320
German's so shitty that horses speak it.

14:33.320 --> 14:37.320
If I was a horse, if I were a horse, to use a subjunctive,

14:37.320 --> 14:41.320
if I were a horse and someone tried to get me to run

14:41.320 --> 14:44.320
in Italian, I'd be like, I don't know if I could take a nap.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.320
Hey, a little horse.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.320
He'd be like, I don't know, what do I do?

14:49.320 --> 14:53.320
You will stay and they're going to say,

14:53.320 --> 14:55.320
I'm a German.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.320
That sounds like, get the fuck going.

14:57.320 --> 15:02.320
I'm just spreading white on white racism right now.

15:02.320 --> 15:07.320
Speaking of which, let's do a World Cup Sports Corner.

15:07.320 --> 15:19.320
Dan?

15:19.320 --> 15:21.320
The World Cup, boy.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.320
What a World Cup.

15:23.320 --> 15:26.320
I'll start just by saying, Dan, that I was on the road

15:26.320 --> 15:28.320
this last weekend with the Who's Line boys

15:28.320 --> 15:30.320
and we had these big tour bus rides.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.320
We watched every minute of the World Cups.

15:32.320 --> 15:36.320
That cup was extra, worldly.

15:36.320 --> 15:39.320
Today, Dan, I'm sure like all Americans,

15:39.320 --> 15:41.320
you have strong feelings about USA Portugal.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.320
I know that the United States was involved

15:43.320 --> 15:46.320
in the World Cup today, everyone knows it.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.320
That's part of what makes it extra more important

15:49.320 --> 15:53.320
than the already totally important World Cup,

15:53.320 --> 15:58.320
is that America was part of the World Cup today.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.320
I know, I know.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.320
Do you think they're going to make it out of the group stage?

16:03.320 --> 16:05.320
They're not done?

16:05.320 --> 16:07.320
No.

16:07.320 --> 16:09.320
I think that America today...

16:09.320 --> 16:11.320
Does anybody even hear, and I don't imagine the answer

16:11.320 --> 16:13.320
will be yes, does anybody hear afraid

16:13.320 --> 16:15.320
of hearing soccer spoilers today?

16:15.320 --> 16:18.320
Soccer spoilers.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.320
I was running scared because I was on a plane

16:20.320 --> 16:23.320
during two of the matches and I had to make it home

16:23.320 --> 16:25.320
and hope that some guy didn't go like,

16:25.320 --> 16:27.320
within it or...

16:27.320 --> 16:29.320
Right, you don't want to, you come off the plane

16:29.320 --> 16:31.320
and there's a guy, instead of holding a sign

16:31.320 --> 16:33.320
that says Davis, it says,

16:33.320 --> 16:36.320
they didn't use their hands.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.320
And you're like, oh shit, fuck.

16:39.320 --> 16:43.320
Yeah, so today was a big day

16:43.320 --> 16:45.320
in World Cup football,

16:45.320 --> 16:48.320
what they call football history.

16:48.320 --> 16:50.320
I think that how many more games to go?

16:50.320 --> 16:52.320
Two, three, five?

16:52.320 --> 16:54.320
They're in the group stage, they have to play Germany,

16:54.320 --> 16:56.320
a draw gets them through.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.320
This is a big deal, so the U.S. won, of course.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.320
No.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.320
It was a draw today.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.320
They were beating Portugal, they've never beaten...

17:05.320 --> 17:07.320
It was going to be the best victory of all time

17:07.320 --> 17:10.320
and they lost it in the last kick of the game.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.320
It was a draw in the last kick of the game.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.320
And if they'd won it, they would have been

17:14.320 --> 17:16.320
advanced to the knockout stage.

17:16.320 --> 17:18.320
But why am I telling you this, Dan?

17:18.320 --> 17:20.320
You're the sports...

17:20.320 --> 17:23.320
So they did good.

17:23.320 --> 17:26.320
Yeah, they did very, very well.

17:26.320 --> 17:30.320
Shit on the bit a little bit.

17:30.320 --> 17:33.320
I guess they did okay.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.320
What do you think the...

17:35.320 --> 17:37.320
Who do you like? Which country do you think has the best...

17:37.320 --> 17:40.320
USA. I mean, I think the USA is going to go all the way.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.320
You thought they were already out of it.

17:43.320 --> 17:46.320
I think that they're in the cup.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.320
In the World Cup, what people need to understand,

17:48.320 --> 17:51.320
it doesn't work like American football.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.320
In the World Cup, it's possible to be

17:57.320 --> 18:00.320
in the cup with other teams.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.320
It's not about brackets and

18:03.320 --> 18:06.320
this team beat the other team.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.320
It's like, we're all in the cup together.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.320
Eventually it does come down.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.320
I'm not being naive.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.320
Eventually it does come down to two teams.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.320
But it's very worldly.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.320
And they go down and they're in the cup.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.320
And the US is in that cup, which I think is amazing.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.320
It's a World Cup and it's about time the US was in it.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.320
It's fucking great.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.320
And nobody use your hands!

18:30.320 --> 18:32.320
Stop using your hands!

18:32.320 --> 18:34.320
What do you think about the home nation's job

18:34.320 --> 18:36.320
so far of hosting this?

18:36.320 --> 18:38.320
Well, I mean, the US is doing...

18:38.320 --> 18:40.320
I mean, they're doing what they can.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.320
They're...

18:42.320 --> 18:45.320
I don't mean that they're the home nation.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.320
Right.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.320
From that reaction.

18:48.320 --> 18:51.320
I mean that the US is handling themselves

18:51.320 --> 18:54.320
very graciously as a guest of the home nation.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.320
Going up that red carpet.

18:56.320 --> 19:00.320
And competing in that soccer stadium.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.320
When I say soccer, I use it colloquially.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.320
I know it's called football.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.320
And spell drawing.

19:06.320 --> 19:09.320
I think that it's great.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.320
I think it's a great...

19:11.320 --> 19:13.320
The home nation that you're talking about.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.320
Brazil. Brazil.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.320
Yeah, they're doing great.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.320
Long gone are the days

19:18.320 --> 19:26.320
of accusing them of harboring Hitler.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.320
Let's put aside these stereotypes

19:28.320 --> 19:33.320
of child porn and...

19:33.320 --> 19:36.320
Orwellian futures.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.320
Now, Dan, normally,

19:38.320 --> 19:40.320
we think of the...

19:40.320 --> 19:41.320
We don't think everyone in Brazil

19:41.320 --> 19:44.320
has to work on a typewriter.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.320
Fuck you, Terry Gilliam.

19:46.320 --> 19:49.320
The important thing is soccer.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.320
We think of the big European superpowers.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.320
And a couple have already been

19:53.320 --> 19:54.320
shamefully knocked out.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.320
Who do you like in terms of the European,

19:56.320 --> 19:58.320
you know, old granddaddy superpowers?

19:58.320 --> 20:00.320
Well, I mean, you gotta go England.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.320
I mean, they're great.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.320
They're great at football.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.320
You think they still have a chance?

20:05.320 --> 20:08.320
Uh...

20:08.320 --> 20:12.320
I know that's a trick question.

20:12.320 --> 20:16.320
Because I can tell.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.320
So, fuck you.

20:18.320 --> 20:21.320
They invented the sport, you know, so...

20:21.320 --> 20:23.320
Yeah, but, like, guess what?

20:23.320 --> 20:25.320
Jeff, they're out.

20:28.320 --> 20:33.320
You're like a really shitty mentalist.

20:33.320 --> 20:38.320
I can think of myself as a big fan of soccer.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.320
Yeah, so England's out,

20:40.320 --> 20:42.320
and it's crazy that USA's still in.

20:42.320 --> 20:46.320
They're still in that big cup with the world.

20:46.320 --> 20:50.320
I think Argentina is probably

20:50.320 --> 20:57.320
going to not be able to be underestimated.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.320
I don't think you ever should underestimate Argentina.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.320
I think you've got that exactly right.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.320
You've got a lot of guys out there.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.320
They've got the calves and their muscles

21:04.320 --> 21:05.320
and the muscles and their calves.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.320
They're kicking the ball.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.320
They're not gonna use their hands.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.320
Argentina...

21:10.320 --> 21:12.320
If you use your hand to say hello,

21:12.320 --> 21:14.320
you get thrown in jail.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.320
This is a soccer nation, Argentina.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.320
They're continual World Cup champions.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.320
Am I right?

21:21.320 --> 21:23.320
Argentina's constantly winning the World Cup.

21:23.320 --> 21:24.320
Right?

21:24.320 --> 21:26.320
Historically, go back!

21:26.320 --> 21:28.320
Go back all the way to the beginning!

21:28.320 --> 21:32.320
Historically, Argentina has won a World Cup.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.320
Never.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.320
1970s, I think we go back.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.320
See? You gotta go back.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.320
You gotta be a true soccer enthusiast

21:38.320 --> 21:41.320
to really appreciate Argentinian soccer.

21:41.320 --> 21:44.320
One thing I find, and I think you'll agree or disagree,

21:44.320 --> 21:47.320
because you have very strong opinions about this,

21:47.320 --> 21:49.320
I look at soccer in a really specific way.

21:49.320 --> 21:53.320
The fact that this is a South American country

21:53.320 --> 21:56.320
hosting this, the South and Central American teams

21:56.320 --> 21:57.320
are doing quite well.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.320
They're really leaping forward.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.320
There's certain teams that had to have surprised you

22:00.320 --> 22:02.320
from South and Central America.

22:02.320 --> 22:06.320
Really, aside from Argentina,

22:06.320 --> 22:09.320
which we shouldn't ever not possibly underestimate.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.320
No, there aren't.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.320
Yeah, you're right.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.320
I think if I'm hearing you correctly,

22:12.320 --> 22:13.320
what you're saying...

22:13.320 --> 22:16.320
Name any country in Central or South America

22:20.320 --> 22:24.320
that might have a football team in the World Cup.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.320
Look, currently.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.320
I hope I don't disappoint you

22:28.320 --> 22:30.320
by approaching this question from the outskirts.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.320
You have to look at the big picture of soccer,

22:32.320 --> 22:34.320
the history of soccer.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.320
In the beginning.

22:36.320 --> 22:39.320
This is a game that was traditionally dominated

22:39.320 --> 22:42.320
by South America and Central America.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.320
You had the Panamanians.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.320
What do they know?

22:49.320 --> 22:51.320
They know canals.

22:51.320 --> 22:54.320
They're not good at soccer.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.320
Ecuador.

22:56.320 --> 23:00.320
They're good, but not good enough.

23:05.320 --> 23:08.320
I think they were in the cup briefly this time.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.320
We're getting warmer here.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.320
Yeah, that's what I said.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.320
That's what I just said.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.320
It irks me when he...

23:16.320 --> 23:21.320
I'm trying to give my World Cup report,

23:21.320 --> 23:25.320
and he comes in and it's like, I said that.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.320
The Aztecs...

23:31.320 --> 23:33.320
I'm not saying they still have a country...

23:33.320 --> 23:36.320
You mean the old L.A. Indoor Soccer Club from the 1980s?

23:39.320 --> 23:41.320
Look, at the end of the day,

23:41.320 --> 23:43.320
you have a country like North America...

23:43.320 --> 23:45.320
At the end of the day? God damn it.

23:45.320 --> 23:49.320
North America is what it is at the end of the day.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.320
It is what it is.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.320
South of that, you have Central America,

23:53.320 --> 23:55.320
and a lot of people don't understand.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.320
South of Central America, you have South America.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.320
Am I wrong?

23:58.320 --> 24:00.320
This is good soccer information.

24:00.320 --> 24:04.320
So, I think Chili's going to win the World Cup this year.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.320
They're doing really well.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.320
They really are.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.320
Them and Costa Rica are looking fucking awesome right now.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.320
All right, fuck you!

24:15.320 --> 24:17.320
World Cup!

24:17.320 --> 24:19.320
Chili, my buddy's on Chili!

24:19.320 --> 24:21.320
Chili!

24:21.320 --> 24:23.320
I didn't even know there was South America.

24:25.320 --> 24:27.320
40% chance it was Africa.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.320
My knowledge of the globe is like,

24:35.320 --> 24:37.320
my dog barks at my gardener,

24:37.320 --> 24:39.320
and then I'm like, I don't know what.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.320
Yeah, I gotta work.

24:42.320 --> 24:45.320
All right, that's it. That's all I gotta talk about.

24:45.320 --> 24:46.320
That was a quick show?

24:46.320 --> 24:48.320
Yeah, goodnight everybody.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.320
Spencer!

24:49.320 --> 24:50.320
Hey guys.

24:50.320 --> 24:54.320
Hey, you know recently we had the Harmontown movie screening.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.320
Do you remember that?

24:55.320 --> 24:56.320
Oh yeah, yeah.

24:56.320 --> 25:00.320
Today you guys go to the L.A. movies.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.320
Yeah.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.320
I mean, I wasn't trying to, you know,

25:04.320 --> 25:07.320
encourage one of those pity applause or whatever.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.320
Has anything...

25:10.320 --> 25:12.320
That time I was! Good job!

25:13.320 --> 25:17.320
Nothing's changed for you since that movie premiered in L.A., right?

25:17.320 --> 25:18.320
Right, you still...

25:18.320 --> 25:21.320
But you, okay, so remember in the Q&A,

25:21.320 --> 25:23.320
the guy, there's this host guy,

25:23.320 --> 25:25.320
he was like the LACMA dude, whatever.

25:25.320 --> 25:28.320
He brought us all up, and then he was like,

25:28.320 --> 25:33.320
you know, someone told me a story about how you and Neil first met.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.320
Yeah.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.320
It was in a pizza joint.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.320
Yeah.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.320
And it wasn't.

25:38.320 --> 25:39.320
Yeah.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.320
And you told him that, like right off the bat,

25:41.320 --> 25:43.320
you were like, yeah, that was wrong.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.320
And then like he got mad.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.320
He got mad?

25:46.320 --> 25:47.320
Remember that?

25:47.320 --> 25:48.320
I don't know.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.320
Maybe he was just flustered,

25:49.320 --> 25:51.320
but like he got really like weird about it.

25:51.320 --> 25:54.320
He was like, well, that's just what I heard.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.320
Yeah, okay, I remember that.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.320
He's mad at his assistant's briefing.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.320
Yeah, I guess.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.320
Yeah, but I was thinking it would be weird

26:01.320 --> 26:03.320
if he just got really indignant about it.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.320
It was like, no!

26:04.320 --> 26:05.320
It was pizza!

26:05.320 --> 26:07.320
You have pepperoni!

26:07.320 --> 26:09.320
There's three slices left over.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.320
Everybody knows it was pizza.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.320
Yeah.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.320
What are you doing to me right now?

26:13.320 --> 26:14.320
Yeah.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.320
But yeah, I don't know.

26:15.320 --> 26:19.320
Do you remember at the LA Film Festival

26:19.320 --> 26:21.320
when all the cast came out

26:21.320 --> 26:23.320
and then you got more applause than me?

26:23.320 --> 26:24.320
Yeah, yeah.

26:24.320 --> 26:27.320
I was hoping I wouldn't have to bring that up.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.320
I'll bring it up.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.320
I'll bring it up.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.320
They brought us all out.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.320
The whole cast of the movie, cast,

26:33.320 --> 26:34.320
it's a documentary.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.320
He was there.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.320
So it's not like we're playing characters.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.320
Like so I could go,

26:37.320 --> 26:39.320
oh Spencer did do a good job in that character.

26:39.320 --> 26:40.320
As himself.

26:40.320 --> 26:42.320
Who am I?

26:42.320 --> 26:44.320
Playing Chop Lover.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.320
Like, I...

26:46.320 --> 26:48.320
It was like...

26:48.320 --> 26:49.320
They were like,

26:49.320 --> 26:51.320
Spencer Crittin did it in the fucking crowd.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.320
Like, they rose to their feet.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.320
Yeah, if the cast of Star Wars,

26:54.320 --> 26:55.320
if the characters came out,

26:55.320 --> 26:58.320
they would clap louder for Han Solo than Darth Vader.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.320
Well, I'm not...

27:00.320 --> 27:03.320
I actually think...

27:03.320 --> 27:06.320
I actually think they would clap

27:06.320 --> 27:08.320
like pretty loud for Darth Vader,

27:08.320 --> 27:10.320
but that's what actually hurts

27:10.320 --> 27:12.320
is I felt like I was like one of the

27:12.320 --> 27:14.320
Jawa's.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.320
And they kind of staggered it,

27:18.320 --> 27:19.320
and they were like, Spencer,

27:19.320 --> 27:20.320
and everyone was like, woo!

27:20.320 --> 27:21.320
And then it was like,

27:21.320 --> 27:23.320
and of course, the titular character,

27:23.320 --> 27:25.320
Dan Hyman, and everyone was like,

27:25.320 --> 27:27.320
he's fine too, it's fine.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.320
Maybe they were all clapped out from Spencer.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.320
They were!

27:32.320 --> 27:33.320
Yes, they were!

27:33.320 --> 27:35.320
Yes, their hands were bleeding!

27:36.320 --> 27:37.320
And I don't...

27:37.320 --> 27:39.320
Have you ever been torn between...

27:39.320 --> 27:41.320
It's funny, because I'm 41.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.320
I should have a son, Spencer's age.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.320
If everything had gone correctly,

27:47.320 --> 27:49.320
according to the Midwestern tradition,

27:49.320 --> 27:51.320
I would have you as a son.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.320
Nice.

27:54.320 --> 27:55.320
And...

27:55.320 --> 27:57.320
There's still wills to write, I mean.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.320
So I kind of...

28:03.320 --> 28:05.320
Yeah, I imagine that's going to be like,

28:05.320 --> 28:07.320
like to have a kid, like...

28:07.320 --> 28:11.320
Ah, get that, get that, get that soccer goal.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.320
Win that potato science fair thing.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.320
And then there must be some other part of you that's like,

28:18.320 --> 28:20.320
fuck, he did it, he did it.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.320
And then you just go in the attic and just...

28:23.320 --> 28:24.320
Hunter Thompson.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.320
Because you're like, what else do I...

28:28.320 --> 28:29.320
Write a bunch of wonderful books?

28:29.320 --> 28:30.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.320
I'm sorry I made it dark, I didn't mean to...

28:35.320 --> 28:37.320
I didn't mean it.

28:37.320 --> 28:39.320
If you guys ever think I would actually kill myself,

28:39.320 --> 28:40.320
you're insane.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.320
I'm so much more petty than that.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.320
I would never...

28:45.320 --> 28:47.320
If anybody's worried about that ever happening,

28:47.320 --> 28:48.320
that's...

28:48.320 --> 28:50.320
What if you were in, like, pain, like Hunter S. Thompson?

28:50.320 --> 28:51.320
If I'm in pain...

28:51.320 --> 28:53.320
Yeah, if I get a cold, fuck it.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.320
But I will go to one doctor, one doctor.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.320
Can you knock this out?

29:00.320 --> 29:01.320
And if he's like, give it six weeks,

29:01.320 --> 29:05.320
I'm like, give me five weeks, bang!

29:05.320 --> 29:07.320
Waiting period, another five...

29:07.320 --> 29:10.320
If my leg hurts, yeah, fuck it.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.320
Alright, so, let's move on.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.320
This is depressing.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.320
I'm gonna pull out...

29:16.320 --> 29:17.320
I don't think there's anything in here.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.320
I'm really excited about...

29:19.320 --> 29:21.320
Robert DeVall playing...

29:22.320 --> 29:24.320
Robert Johnny Jr.'s dad.

29:24.320 --> 29:25.320
World Cup.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.320
I'm gonna be honest with you,

29:27.320 --> 29:29.320
that was just part of that whole linguistic thing.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.320
Like, some people say, Aaron was saying that,

29:31.320 --> 29:32.320
I was talking about that with her,

29:32.320 --> 29:33.320
it's just like, people say,

29:33.320 --> 29:34.320
Honestly?

29:34.320 --> 29:35.320
Or they go like,

29:35.320 --> 29:36.320
I'm gonna be honest with you.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.320
Yeah.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.320
And there's nothing wrong with that.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.320
Like, we're gonna get beyond the whole idea of like,

29:40.320 --> 29:42.320
oh, I hate that, we should never do that and stuff.

29:42.320 --> 29:44.320
It's just something that we do.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.320
Sometimes we do it.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.320
There's people out here who have abused that,

29:47.320 --> 29:48.320
there's people who...

29:48.320 --> 29:50.320
I have used the phrase,

29:50.320 --> 29:52.320
I'm gonna be honest with you,

29:52.320 --> 29:54.320
two wonderful effects.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.320
I'll give you an example.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.320
No, there's no example.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.320
I'm just saying like,

30:01.320 --> 30:03.320
it's not about being a good or bad person.

30:03.320 --> 30:06.320
Somebody tweeted me a link, Jeff.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.320
Somebody tweeted me a link.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.320
What was that link?

30:13.320 --> 30:15.320
To this guy that does his thing,

30:15.320 --> 30:17.320
it's called, what the hell is it called?

30:17.320 --> 30:19.320
Surveillance cameraman?

30:19.320 --> 30:21.320
Does anybody know what I'm talking about?

30:21.320 --> 30:24.320
The man who deals with surveillance cameras.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.320
It's a guy who takes a camera, a kid,

30:26.320 --> 30:28.320
maybe I should call him, I don't know what to call him.

30:28.320 --> 30:31.320
Takes a camera and he just,

30:31.320 --> 30:33.320
now dismiss all your notions of like,

30:33.320 --> 30:35.320
good person, bad person, you know,

30:35.320 --> 30:37.320
just assume he's a bad person.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.320
It sounds like he is.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.320
He just takes a camera and he just

30:41.320 --> 30:43.320
goes up and gets in people's faces.

30:43.320 --> 30:45.320
He just stands there with the camera.

30:45.320 --> 30:46.320
That's what he does.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.320
People can see the camera as a hidden camera?

30:47.320 --> 30:49.320
Yeah, no, they can see it.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.320
And then they, so it's just,

30:51.320 --> 30:53.320
and then it's a montage of people

30:53.320 --> 30:56.320
looking and going, what are you doing?

30:58.320 --> 30:59.320
Stop it.

30:59.320 --> 31:03.320
And then it splinters off into all of this behavior,

31:03.320 --> 31:05.320
none of which is good or bad,

31:05.320 --> 31:06.320
all of which is fascinating.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.320
Is he provoking them with questions or things?

31:08.320 --> 31:11.320
No, he turns the, this kid has,

31:11.320 --> 31:13.320
I mean, I think this kid is just going through

31:13.320 --> 31:14.320
a phase that we all went through,

31:14.320 --> 31:16.320
but he has access to more technology

31:16.320 --> 31:17.320
than we had when we were this age,

31:17.320 --> 31:18.320
because kids age.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.320
That's my assumption, but don't,

31:20.320 --> 31:22.320
I don't know, he could be 48 years old.

31:22.320 --> 31:27.320
Like, what matters is that this kid has effectively,

31:27.320 --> 31:30.320
like, regardless of what he's doing,

31:30.320 --> 31:34.320
the end result of what you're watching

31:34.320 --> 31:36.320
is that you're getting to see humanity

31:36.320 --> 31:38.320
as if you're a scuba diver

31:38.320 --> 31:41.320
outside a coral reef.

31:41.320 --> 31:44.320
And so there's fish that gather around you

31:44.320 --> 31:46.320
and are angry at you,

31:46.320 --> 31:47.320
because they're gathered around you.

31:47.320 --> 31:48.320
There's fish that, of course,

31:48.320 --> 31:49.320
dart the other way.

31:49.320 --> 31:52.320
There's fish that come at you

31:52.320 --> 31:53.320
and circle you for a second

31:53.320 --> 31:54.320
and then dart at you

31:54.320 --> 31:56.320
and try to get your mask off.

31:56.320 --> 31:59.320
There's fish that, and everything in between.

31:59.320 --> 32:03.320
This guy, like, will open the back door

32:03.320 --> 32:07.320
of a Burger King and walk into the kitchen.

32:07.320 --> 32:11.320
And it's just a POV of walking through

32:11.320 --> 32:15.320
a fucking Burger King back in the kitchen

32:15.320 --> 32:17.320
with eight people cutting lettuce,

32:17.320 --> 32:19.320
flipping burgers.

32:19.320 --> 32:20.320
And every person he walks by,

32:20.320 --> 32:21.320
it's like they're all Brontosaurus

32:21.320 --> 32:22.320
in Jurassic Park.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.320
They all look at him

32:24.320 --> 32:28.320
and then go back to chopping lettuce.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.320
And then one guy will come up.

32:30.320 --> 32:34.320
That's like, excuse me, hello.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.320
Because he thinks that when he does that,

32:36.320 --> 32:38.320
then that means go away.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.320
But then he has to go to the phone.

32:39.320 --> 32:40.320
Everyone has a different relationship.

32:40.320 --> 32:43.320
There's like a camera that goes into a laundromat

32:43.320 --> 32:45.320
and there's a guy sitting at a table on a laundromat.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.320
And the guy's just sitting at the table on a laundromat

32:47.320 --> 32:50.320
and he's watching this camera come toward him.

32:50.320 --> 32:52.320
And the camera comes toward him.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.320
And then just as it sits down at the table

32:54.320 --> 32:56.320
in the laundromat across from him,

32:56.320 --> 32:59.320
the guy goes from totally just sitting there

32:59.320 --> 33:01.320
watching the camera to flipping out,

33:01.320 --> 33:04.320
flips the table up into the camera,

33:04.320 --> 33:06.320
goes like, what the fuck are you doing?

33:06.320 --> 33:07.320
Get the fuck out of here.

33:07.320 --> 33:10.320
And starts chasing the guy with a chair.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.320
And all this guy ever does,

33:12.320 --> 33:16.320
this guy is not a good person, not a good person.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.320
Is a scuba diver a good person that goes in

33:18.320 --> 33:21.320
and looks at the fucking, according to the fish?

33:21.320 --> 33:23.320
No, no, not good.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.320
Get out of there.

33:24.320 --> 33:25.320
You shouldn't be there.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.320
Don't be there.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.320
I hope it's a kid because that seems like a good

33:27.320 --> 33:30.320
like 17, 16 year old kind of instinct.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.320
It feels like a phase that we all go through.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.320
Well, I went through when I was,

33:34.320 --> 33:36.320
but the interesting thing about it is like,

33:36.320 --> 33:39.320
I never, there's a strangely uplifting component to it

33:39.320 --> 33:44.320
because some people are grabbing at the camera

33:44.320 --> 33:48.320
like literally just like, smash the guy in the face.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.320
Like, like, like, like, maybe-

33:50.320 --> 33:51.320
Does anybody just like see the camera

33:51.320 --> 33:53.320
and just start singing Moon River really well?

33:53.320 --> 33:54.320
There are.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.320
There are some like Ben and Jerry's kind of like old school

33:56.320 --> 33:58.320
like guys with big long beards,

33:58.320 --> 34:01.320
like Spencer in 30 years.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.320
I'll give you 30.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.320
Like some of them just cut to a guy

34:06.320 --> 34:09.320
in a big long gray beard and he's just staring.

34:09.320 --> 34:11.320
Like he's waiting for a crosswalk

34:11.320 --> 34:12.320
and this guy came up to him

34:12.320 --> 34:13.320
and so it's just cuts to this guy

34:13.320 --> 34:15.320
that just stares at the camera

34:15.320 --> 34:17.320
and he's waiting for something to give

34:17.320 --> 34:20.320
and then he goes, I don't know, and walks off.

34:20.320 --> 34:24.320
There is no heroic or villainous reaction

34:24.320 --> 34:27.320
to somebody dehumanizing you.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.320
You know, there is no,

34:29.320 --> 34:35.320
but none of the people who are on this video

34:35.320 --> 34:37.320
are good or bad people.

34:37.320 --> 34:40.320
But the incredibly,

34:40.320 --> 34:42.320
the epiphany I had while watching it was,

34:42.320 --> 34:45.320
oh my god, I've just been given permission

34:45.320 --> 34:49.320
to look at people as if they are animals

34:49.320 --> 34:53.320
because some of them are violent animals

34:53.320 --> 34:57.320
and some of them are pacifistic animals

34:57.320 --> 35:00.320
and some of them are herding around him.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.320
He'll be like in the middle of a target

35:02.320 --> 35:05.320
and then it's just people slowly encroaching on him

35:05.320 --> 35:07.320
going, hey, what are you doing?

35:07.320 --> 35:09.320
Hey, what are you doing?

35:09.320 --> 35:12.320
And they're all ganging up on him

35:12.320 --> 35:14.320
and then one fat guy will come up,

35:14.320 --> 35:16.320
hey, come on, what are you doing?

35:16.320 --> 35:18.320
He's more of an alpha male.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.320
I can just watch it for hours.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.320
But the camera never turns,

35:21.320 --> 35:23.320
you never meet this guy, you never see him?

35:23.320 --> 35:25.320
No, I think in the early ones,

35:25.320 --> 35:26.320
people say, what are you doing

35:26.320 --> 35:28.320
and you hear the kid's voice go,

35:28.320 --> 35:30.320
I'm making a video.

35:30.320 --> 35:33.320
But I think he drops it.

35:33.320 --> 35:36.320
He's Sasha Baron Cohen but without the ego.

35:36.320 --> 35:39.320
Let's assume this kid is the worst piece of shit in the world.

35:39.320 --> 35:41.320
Let's assume he's like pre-columbine,

35:41.320 --> 35:43.320
he's ready to, you know,

35:43.320 --> 35:46.320
let's not pin any medals to his chest.

35:46.320 --> 35:51.320
But all I know is that the content

35:51.320 --> 35:53.320
that's coming out of the other side,

35:53.320 --> 35:56.320
I think is art because I am like,

35:56.320 --> 36:01.320
I've never, I've had to watch people

36:01.320 --> 36:03.320
on YouTube a lot

36:03.320 --> 36:06.320
and I've never been so fucking fascinated,

36:06.320 --> 36:09.320
which is really interesting.

36:09.320 --> 36:11.320
And all he does is just say nothing

36:11.320 --> 36:13.320
and just get in people's faces

36:13.320 --> 36:15.320
and with his camera.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.320
What would your reaction be if somebody woke up to you?

36:17.320 --> 36:18.320
I don't know.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.320
I don't know.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.320
It might be different.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.320
It would be one thing on Tuesday,

36:21.320 --> 36:22.320
one thing on Wednesday.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.320
Let's paint a picture.

36:23.320 --> 36:28.320
Let's say that you're,

36:28.320 --> 36:30.320
what do you do?

36:30.320 --> 36:35.320
You're standing outside the drawing room on your phone,

36:35.320 --> 36:36.320
let's say.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.320
Am I drunk?

36:39.320 --> 36:40.320
Midway.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.320
You're not drunk yet.

36:41.320 --> 36:42.320
You've had a few.

36:42.320 --> 36:43.320
Who am I talking to on the phone?

36:43.320 --> 36:44.320
Aaron.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.320
And Aaron on the phone?

36:45.320 --> 36:46.320
Aaron's on the phone.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.320
I mean, he's fine.

36:47.320 --> 36:48.320
Bad mood.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.320
Yeah, and then you just out there

36:49.320 --> 36:52.320
and then you hang up the phone

36:52.320 --> 36:54.320
and now you're not talking to anybody.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.320
Now you're taking the moments,

36:55.320 --> 36:57.320
a nice day out in California

36:57.320 --> 36:59.320
and you're going through Instagram

36:59.320 --> 37:01.320
or through tweets or whatever.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.320
So now you're just idling out there.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.320
And this person, let's say.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.320
So a guy comes up and he gets about,

37:06.320 --> 37:08.320
this guy usually gets,

37:08.320 --> 37:09.320
if he's allowed to,

37:09.320 --> 37:11.320
he gets about a foot and a half.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.320
Wow.

37:12.320 --> 37:13.320
It's personal space.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.320
Yeah, yeah.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.320
That's a bubble-burster for most of you.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.320
Yeah, if he didn't have a camera with him,

37:18.320 --> 37:20.320
it would be weird.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.320
The camera makes it less weird.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.320
I want to stretch over and over and over and over again

37:24.320 --> 37:26.320
because we belong to this culture where it's like,

37:26.320 --> 37:27.320
oh, he's a good person.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.320
He's a bad person.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.320
I don't know if this person could be a whore.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.320
It doesn't matter.

37:31.320 --> 37:34.320
So this day, you don't have a chip on your shoulders.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.320
There's nothing really like that.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.320
And the guy just comes up.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.320
Yeah.

37:37.320 --> 37:40.320
But honestly, like, I just got off the phone with Aaron.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.320
So I'm outside the drawing room.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.320
The camera comes up and I go,

37:44.320 --> 37:45.320
hello.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.320
Hi.

37:46.320 --> 37:50.320
Hey, so this guy just stands there and doesn't do anything?

37:50.320 --> 37:51.320
Who are you?

37:51.320 --> 37:53.320
Yeah, this is what often people are doing.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.320
They're going, like, hello.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.320
What are you doing?

37:56.320 --> 37:57.320
What are you doing?

37:57.320 --> 38:00.320
Now, then a bunch of people, some people go,

38:00.320 --> 38:02.320
and I don't think these people are bad people at all,

38:02.320 --> 38:09.320
they go, and they fucking, like, thrust, smack.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.320
The camera goes black.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.320
They punch him.

38:13.320 --> 38:15.320
They grab his camera.

38:15.320 --> 38:18.320
They grab, and then he fades back.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.320
Like a bird.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.320
And then moves, drifts back in.

38:22.320 --> 38:23.320
Oh, really?

38:23.320 --> 38:25.320
Like fucking Rocky Balboa?

38:25.320 --> 38:27.320
He just goes, hey, down, Rock.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.320
Yeah.

38:28.320 --> 38:31.320
He just kind of, like, he just acts like a weather phenomenon.

38:31.320 --> 38:33.320
I don't want to praise this person.

38:33.320 --> 38:35.320
I don't think what he's doing is heroic.

38:35.320 --> 38:38.320
So you've done 10 seconds of what's going on.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.320
I would go, do you walk away?

38:40.320 --> 38:41.320
Do you do a bit?

38:41.320 --> 38:46.320
Here's what I think I would do in my current mood right now.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.320
It happens as you leave the room.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.320
I just got off the phone with Aaron.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.320
I'm not in a fight with Aaron.

38:51.320 --> 38:52.320
I'm not in a bad mood.

38:52.320 --> 38:55.320
I'm not feeling insecure about where I am in my life.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.320
I get off the phone.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.320
There's a guy doing this.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.320
He's a stranger to me.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.320
He's holding a camera in my face.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.320
I would go, hello.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.320
I would be like, hi.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.320
What are you doing?

39:04.320 --> 39:05.320
What are you doing?

39:05.320 --> 39:06.320
What are you doing?

39:06.320 --> 39:12.320
For a while, I would try to find his exhaustion point.

39:12.320 --> 39:16.320
I would be like, yeah.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.320
But that's me.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.320
And I don't want to stress, that's me in a good depth.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.320
There's a million ways you could catch me.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.320
I'd be like, what the fuck are you doing?

39:25.320 --> 39:27.320
Let's say you and Aaron, there's tension brewing.

39:27.320 --> 39:30.320
And let's say you got a call from, you know,

39:30.320 --> 39:33.320
an irritating call from an agent or a lawyer.

39:33.320 --> 39:37.320
Or like on the heels of me being all over the headlines online.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.320
Well, but Chevy Chase says, oh, the Chevy Chase.

39:39.320 --> 39:40.320
The Chevy Chase.

39:40.320 --> 39:41.320
Well, that needed to happen.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.320
Well, that needed to happen.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.320
Chevy Chase down in Harvard.

39:43.320 --> 39:44.320
You'd assume that was a paparazzo couple.

39:44.320 --> 39:45.320
Yeah.

39:45.320 --> 39:47.320
And I would be like, OK, hey, hi, Chevy Chase.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.320
Hi.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.320
And then the guy would be like, stay there.

39:51.320 --> 39:54.320
And I'd be like, OK, so hi, hi, Chevy Chase.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.320
I don't, but, but, but.

39:56.320 --> 39:59.320
I think you should always do that whatever happens.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.320
But, but, but the truth is.

40:01.320 --> 40:03.320
If a stranger walks up to you and starts to shake your head.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.320
I think it's really interesting.

40:04.320 --> 40:07.320
The series is that you're not dealing with people who,

40:07.320 --> 40:10.320
who have any relationship with cameras at all.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.320
And that's the most interesting thing is that we,

40:12.320 --> 40:18.320
we all have protocols that we initiate in when we feel like

40:18.320 --> 40:20.320
something strange is happening to us.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.320
And cameras dehumanize us.

40:23.320 --> 40:27.320
And we invented them to try to capture humanity.

40:27.320 --> 40:30.320
So we're used to using these things.

40:30.320 --> 40:33.320
When we, when we see them, we're like, oh,

40:33.320 --> 40:35.320
I better be human now.

40:35.320 --> 40:39.320
Hey, coming up next on Camera Face.

40:39.320 --> 40:40.320
Coming at you.

40:40.320 --> 40:43.320
And what these people are doing is they're putting their poopy

40:43.320 --> 40:46.320
undies in a laundry, laundry machine.

40:46.320 --> 40:48.320
And then there's a, there's a lens there.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.320
And for me, the unspoken part of what some of them are saying

40:51.320 --> 40:56.320
when they like smash the camera is, is like, hey,

40:56.320 --> 40:59.320
when I'm ready to have a camera on me,

40:59.320 --> 41:02.320
I'll be really fucking, I'll have my shit together.

41:02.320 --> 41:05.320
You know, I'm going to say some amazing things.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.320
And I'm going to, there's something, there's something strange.

41:08.320 --> 41:13.320
That's just my own interpretation.

41:13.320 --> 41:16.320
Because I'm coming from a really specific place.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.320
I think what's interesting about it is that it,

41:18.320 --> 41:20.320
it feels like this kid, I don't hear,

41:20.320 --> 41:23.320
I don't know if he's 15, 25, 48.

41:23.320 --> 41:28.320
He might have a fucking like tiger scars down his face.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.320
Like, like, like, he may look the whole point maybe

41:31.320 --> 41:33.320
that this guy looks like a fucking monster

41:33.320 --> 41:36.320
and has a camera.

41:36.320 --> 41:39.320
What I'm seeing on the videos is the equivalent of like,

41:39.320 --> 41:42.320
if you took like goggles and didn't even strap them

41:42.320 --> 41:44.320
to the back of your head, but just put them down

41:44.320 --> 41:48.320
in a Caribbean like coral reef and like just,

41:48.320 --> 41:51.320
like you're always looking at people as if they're animals.

41:51.320 --> 41:54.320
I've been asked several times, I was on the show in time

41:54.320 --> 41:57.320
when there was like a sketch show, like a TV show.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.320
And also I've been asked to do other things

41:59.320 --> 42:00.320
that were hidden camera shows.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.320
I did one, I did Jimmy Kennedy experiment.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.320
I don't like it.

42:03.320 --> 42:06.320
I don't like ambush style stuff.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.320
Like, because they tend, those shows tend to,

42:08.320 --> 42:10.320
somebody kind of has to lose a little bit.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.320
And I don't think it's funny when someone loses.

42:12.320 --> 42:15.320
And I was supposed to, we were on Venice Beach doing these bits.

42:15.320 --> 42:17.320
And this is a show called Daner Channel that was on

42:17.320 --> 42:19.320
for like six episodes a long time ago.

42:19.320 --> 42:22.320
And we were on Venice Beach and there was a crack house

42:22.320 --> 42:24.320
like looking place across the boardwalk.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.320
That was where the hidden cameras were.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.320
There was a guy dressed as a bum that was a cameraman.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.320
So he's laying by.

42:29.320 --> 42:30.320
So there was cameras everywhere.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.320
And I had glasses on early day like camera,

42:32.320 --> 42:34.320
like in the middle of the glasses.

42:34.320 --> 42:36.320
And I had, I was selling stuff.

42:36.320 --> 42:38.320
And I did this one because I thought I could make it funny kind of.

42:38.320 --> 42:40.320
And so I was selling that with a dolphin jerky.

42:40.320 --> 42:43.320
And people get really bummed out about it.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.320
But I mean, there was also some people who was like,

42:46.320 --> 42:47.320
I'll try that dolphin jerky.

42:47.320 --> 42:52.320
And there was a little sticker on it with a picture of a tuna

42:52.320 --> 42:54.320
and a line through it like it was tuna safe.

42:54.320 --> 42:57.320
But there was one we're selling.

42:57.320 --> 43:00.320
And it was Che Guevara's.

43:00.320 --> 43:03.320
It was a cereal, but Che Guevara based cereal.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.320
Or your Che Crunchies or something like that.

43:05.320 --> 43:07.320
And they were a little bit,

43:07.320 --> 43:10.320
instead of like green clovers and blue stars or whatever the fuck,

43:10.320 --> 43:13.320
it was like cameras and sickles and revolutionary stars.

43:13.320 --> 43:18.320
And so I'm selling these Che Crunchies and these three girls come up

43:18.320 --> 43:21.320
and they're like kind of tough.

43:21.320 --> 43:27.320
And I would describe if I could guess what their lifestyle was.

43:27.320 --> 43:31.320
Anarchists are like very left leaning, possibly lesbian.

43:31.320 --> 43:35.320
Lots of piercings, probably very intellectual.

43:35.320 --> 43:38.320
And also like a little bit of LA street tough kind of, you know,

43:38.320 --> 43:41.320
like they didn't come from like privilege or anything.

43:41.320 --> 43:44.320
And they came up and they were instantly just fucking bummed out about it.

43:44.320 --> 43:47.320
And I have a little ear speaker or whatever they call it, earwig things.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.320
And I have the producers saying like,

43:49.320 --> 43:51.320
oh yeah, these are good, these are good, go after these girls, go after these girls.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.320
I'm like, I'm not going to fucking go after these girls.

43:53.320 --> 43:55.320
Kill her, kill me.

43:55.320 --> 43:57.320
And they're like, what the fuck's up with the cereal?

43:57.320 --> 44:00.320
Do you think that Che Guevara, if you were alive today, would sign off on that?

44:00.320 --> 44:02.320
Do you think it's family?

44:02.320 --> 44:04.320
And I was like, no, no, no, half of the proceeds,

44:04.320 --> 44:06.320
if you buy a box of Che Crunchies,

44:06.320 --> 44:10.320
goes to these Appetistas living in the hills of Chiapas.

44:10.320 --> 44:14.320
And then the speaker, they're like, no, no, no, antagonize it.

44:14.320 --> 44:16.320
I'm like, fuck you.

44:16.320 --> 44:19.320
I said, they're like, what?

44:19.320 --> 44:23.320
I go, you know, like Cubans invented cereal.

44:26.320 --> 44:29.320
It's a communist product, through and through.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.320
This is a very lefty, red...

44:31.320 --> 44:34.320
I go, you're probably too young, but have you seen Islet Lucy?

44:34.320 --> 44:39.320
I said, Ricky Riccardo is a Cuban.

44:39.320 --> 44:43.320
And he eats cereal in every scene, because it's a Cuban.

44:43.320 --> 44:47.320
And they were like, two of them were starting to go like, for real?

44:47.320 --> 44:48.320
Like, wow.

44:48.320 --> 44:51.320
And one of them was just like, she was just staring at me,

44:51.320 --> 44:52.320
and she wasn't buying it.

44:52.320 --> 44:55.320
And then she saw the little dot in the center of my glasses,

44:55.320 --> 44:57.320
and she saw that it was a camera,

44:57.320 --> 44:59.320
and then she realized that she was on a TV show.

44:59.320 --> 45:02.320
And she looked at me, and she gave me this look, and she goes,

45:02.320 --> 45:04.320
It's a camera.

45:04.320 --> 45:07.320
Like, I go, I go, yeah.

45:07.320 --> 45:10.320
So the people in the thing couldn't hear us.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.320
And they're like, all right, I go, thank you.

45:13.320 --> 45:15.320
They just left.

45:15.320 --> 45:18.320
They asked me to do a thing where like, there's people making sand art,

45:18.320 --> 45:20.320
and there's people selling stuff, and there's people on the boardwalk,

45:20.320 --> 45:22.320
that their whole lifestyle, their whole living,

45:22.320 --> 45:24.320
is they do crazy shit on the boardwalk.

45:24.320 --> 45:28.320
They make funky art, or they roller skate and play guitar,

45:28.320 --> 45:30.320
or they make sand castles and shit.

45:30.320 --> 45:32.320
And they wanted me to come out there with a leaf blower,

45:32.320 --> 45:34.320
and just fuck around.

45:34.320 --> 45:39.320
Absolutely not, because that's not funny to anyone but an asshole.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.320
So another guy in the cast did it. Guess what?

45:41.320 --> 45:44.320
It wasn't in the show, because everyone wanted to fucking murder him.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.320
Yeah, I don't like that stuff.

45:46.320 --> 45:48.320
Although he did have the leaf blower, and there's a bunch of Hare Krishna,

45:48.320 --> 45:50.320
the Hare Krishna guys dancing and banging on cymbals,

45:50.320 --> 45:52.320
and they're tambourines.

45:52.320 --> 45:55.320
And they're like, it's a really good shot,

45:55.320 --> 45:57.320
but it never aired out of the thing.

45:57.320 --> 45:59.320
Of him dancing with the Hare Krishna,

45:59.320 --> 46:02.320
while the leaf blower's blowing out their robes around.

46:02.320 --> 46:05.320
But they're like, this is the best day of our lives.

46:05.320 --> 46:07.320
Which makes me like Hare Krishna a lot more.

46:07.320 --> 46:10.320
When I think about cameras being on me all the time,

46:10.320 --> 46:14.320
I actually, I would like to be part of a fairy tale

46:14.320 --> 46:16.320
where I learn that this isn't true,

46:16.320 --> 46:18.320
but I actually feel like the more the better.

46:18.320 --> 46:22.320
Like I feel like this strange perverse,

46:22.320 --> 46:28.320
like I just feel, I feel emotionally like somewhere

46:28.320 --> 46:32.320
at the root of all of my developmental experience,

46:32.320 --> 46:39.320
there's so much people catching you doing things.

46:39.320 --> 46:43.320
People saying, you do what? You're that way?

46:43.320 --> 46:45.320
You that? You do that?

46:45.320 --> 46:47.320
And throughout your adult life.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.320
I mean, this though?

46:51.320 --> 46:57.320
If you're lucky enough to move forward in your adult life,

46:57.320 --> 47:01.320
that you can slowly, like those things become jokes,

47:01.320 --> 47:04.320
they become stand-up bits, they become sketches,

47:04.320 --> 47:06.320
they become poems, they become Tumblr blogs,

47:06.320 --> 47:10.320
they become things like you, you don't just shed them,

47:10.320 --> 47:13.320
you actually drape them around you like feathers

47:13.320 --> 47:16.320
and some amazing cloak, and you start to fly with them.

47:16.320 --> 47:20.320
And I can't, I know that it's probably therefore

47:20.320 --> 47:25.320
not healthy to say, alright everybody just fucking gather around me,

47:25.320 --> 47:28.320
put every camera you have on me, let's all go to bed together,

47:28.320 --> 47:32.320
fucking try as hard as you can to catch me not being a good person.

47:32.320 --> 47:34.320
I bet you can't.

47:34.320 --> 47:37.320
It feels to me like a subversive act.

47:37.320 --> 47:40.320
Like what do you think you're going to catch me doing?

47:40.320 --> 47:42.320
What do you think you're going to catch me thinking?

47:42.320 --> 47:44.320
Everything that I think I say,

47:44.320 --> 47:48.320
do you really, really think that you live in a world

47:48.320 --> 47:52.320
where everyone around you is hiding things from you?

47:52.320 --> 47:55.320
And are you therefore hiding things from everyone?

47:55.320 --> 47:59.320
Can we very, very slowly start to peel these masks away?

47:59.320 --> 48:02.320
Can we talk to each other? Can we see each other?

48:02.320 --> 48:06.320
And so I have a very twisted relationship with surveillance,

48:06.320 --> 48:10.320
these cameras, I don't want fucking NSA watching me through a laptop,

48:10.320 --> 48:14.320
but I do want fans up in my grill.

48:14.320 --> 48:16.320
I do want documentaries made about me.

48:16.320 --> 48:21.320
I wish that I could create an orbit of fucking cameras around me.

48:21.320 --> 48:24.320
I wish that I could be Truman in the Truman Show.

48:24.320 --> 48:27.320
And I understand that compulsion.

48:27.320 --> 48:30.320
And I always wonder like people who feel that way,

48:30.320 --> 48:33.320
because those people, they're on reality shows

48:33.320 --> 48:36.320
and they cut each other up and put each other in suitcases.

48:36.320 --> 48:39.320
Because they're crazy. They want to be superstars.

48:39.320 --> 48:41.320
Like what is that? Where is that?

48:41.320 --> 48:42.320
Just part of you wish that you were an actor

48:42.320 --> 48:44.320
and that you were the kind of guy that if you went to Little Dom's

48:44.320 --> 48:46.320
there'd be paparazzi everywhere?

48:46.320 --> 48:49.320
No, not at all, because that's the opposite.

48:49.320 --> 48:52.320
It's not, that's artifice.

48:52.320 --> 48:55.320
I've been through that. It's the worst. It's terrible.

48:55.320 --> 48:58.320
So what's the difference between those cameras being on you

48:58.320 --> 49:00.320
and who are the other people with cameras that are on you?

49:00.320 --> 49:01.320
I don't know, just an open channel.

49:01.320 --> 49:04.320
I just want that diaphragm dilated.

49:04.320 --> 49:09.320
I just don't want to ever experience, ever again,

49:09.320 --> 49:14.320
being the last person to know that I'm weird.

49:14.320 --> 49:18.320
I just want to be the first person to say,

49:18.320 --> 49:23.320
this is who I am.

49:23.320 --> 49:28.320
I never actually felt that bad

49:28.320 --> 49:30.320
when people beat me up on the playground.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.320
The thing that really made me feel bad

49:32.320 --> 49:34.320
was when the other guy came up and said,

49:34.320 --> 49:37.320
don't beat him up, just because he's...

49:37.320 --> 49:41.320
and he'd list the shit that you should be ashamed of.

49:41.320 --> 49:44.320
Just because he's dirty and stinky and gross

49:44.320 --> 49:47.320
and he pees with his pants around his ankles

49:47.320 --> 49:49.320
like, come on, he's a good guy.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.320
And he wasn't a bad guy.

49:51.320 --> 49:52.320
That guy was trying to stick up for me,

49:52.320 --> 49:54.320
but that's how I have to find out.

49:54.320 --> 49:57.320
That's how I have to find out from a DMV clerk,

49:57.320 --> 50:01.320
from a Verizon employee, from God, from government.

50:01.320 --> 50:04.320
I'm going to be the guy that tells you who I am.

50:04.320 --> 50:07.320
I'm not going to ever stand there

50:07.320 --> 50:11.320
in front of the fucking Krypton Tribunal

50:11.320 --> 50:14.320
and be told that I have to go to the Phantom Zone.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.320
I choose to go to the Phantom Zone.

50:16.320 --> 50:18.320
I'll tell you what's wrong with me.

50:18.320 --> 50:21.320
I hate Superman. He's a piece of shit.

50:21.320 --> 50:25.320
I think he's dumb, stupid, and he looks too good.

50:25.320 --> 50:28.320
I have hatred inside of me.

50:28.320 --> 50:33.320
I want to burn things with my eyes.

50:33.320 --> 50:36.320
I'll tell you, and then I'll be safe.

50:36.320 --> 50:38.320
I'm not going to do anything bad to anybody.

50:38.320 --> 50:40.320
That's why I...

50:40.320 --> 50:42.320
Except Superman. You want to kill Superman.

50:42.320 --> 50:44.320
Well, fuck that guy.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.320
I was just on a fucking came-to-earth

50:46.320 --> 50:48.320
and got a job and a paper. Won't tell anybody.

50:48.320 --> 50:51.320
We're in glasses? You don't need glasses.

50:51.320 --> 50:53.320
You can see everything.

50:53.320 --> 50:57.320
Everyone that loves Superman loves fucking Lex Luthor.

50:57.320 --> 51:00.320
That is the...

51:00.320 --> 51:02.320
I didn't even...

51:02.320 --> 51:04.320
Fucking Lex Luthor is a human being

51:04.320 --> 51:07.320
that's like, who the fuck is this asshole?

51:07.320 --> 51:10.320
I'm smart. I can do anything.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.320
Why am I being counted out?

51:12.320 --> 51:14.320
Is Superman because he's good-looking and can do everything?

51:14.320 --> 51:16.320
Lex Luthor doesn't like Superman

51:16.320 --> 51:18.320
because he fucking...

51:18.320 --> 51:20.320
He didn't have to deal with life on Earth.

51:20.320 --> 51:24.320
Superman thinks he's fucking...

51:24.320 --> 51:26.320
Every Superman movie they make,

51:26.320 --> 51:28.320
over the last 40 years, it's like Superman...

51:28.320 --> 51:30.320
Oh, let's really let people know

51:30.320 --> 51:32.320
how hard it is to be Superman.

51:32.320 --> 51:36.320
What the fuck are you talking about?

51:36.320 --> 51:42.320
He's a Harvard graduate on a galactic scale.

51:42.320 --> 51:44.320
It doesn't...

51:44.320 --> 51:49.320
It's just stupid that he pretends he's from the Midwest.

51:49.320 --> 51:51.320
It's just adding to it.

51:51.320 --> 51:53.320
It's like fucking horrific.

51:53.320 --> 51:58.320
Like, hey, sure wish I was good at football.

51:58.320 --> 52:00.320
Fuck you!

52:00.320 --> 52:04.320
Throw the ball as hard as you can.

52:04.320 --> 52:06.320
If you can throw it harder than us,

52:06.320 --> 52:09.320
let us figure out how to beat you and bury you.

52:09.320 --> 52:11.320
You don't belong here.

52:11.320 --> 52:13.320
You're not a human.

52:13.320 --> 52:16.320
I'll shave my head and I will fucking defeat you

52:16.320 --> 52:18.320
with my knowledge.

52:18.320 --> 52:21.320
I might have to scour the universe

52:21.320 --> 52:23.320
to find what makes you meet.

52:23.320 --> 52:27.320
I will fucking bring you down

52:27.320 --> 52:30.320
because I am super.

52:30.320 --> 52:33.320
Because I wasn't born super.

52:33.320 --> 52:35.320
I was born weak.

52:35.320 --> 52:38.320
That makes me strong.

52:38.320 --> 52:43.320
And I lost my hair.

52:43.320 --> 52:46.320
I don't even know if you know what that means.

52:46.320 --> 52:51.320
For all I know, no man on your planet even has hair loss.

52:51.320 --> 52:54.320
Terrell was bald, too, wasn't he?

52:54.320 --> 52:57.320
Yeah, by choice, I bet.

52:57.320 --> 52:59.320
I bet he looked in the mirror and was like,

52:59.320 --> 53:01.320
I bet I could be more super if I...

53:01.320 --> 53:03.320
I don't know, I don't like that mythology.

53:03.320 --> 53:05.320
I don't like it.

53:05.320 --> 53:07.320
So good.

53:09.320 --> 53:11.320
What year did the first Superman come out?

53:11.320 --> 53:13.320
70s? 78?

53:13.320 --> 53:15.320
So you were, what, five years old?

53:15.320 --> 53:17.320
Four years old, five?

53:17.320 --> 53:20.320
Whatever year you saw it.

53:20.320 --> 53:23.320
You weren't rooting for Superman?

53:23.320 --> 53:27.320
No, you don't root for Superman.

53:27.320 --> 53:29.320
You root for Lois Lane.

53:29.320 --> 53:31.320
You root for Jimmy Olsen.

53:31.320 --> 53:33.320
You root for Lex Luthor.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.320
You may even root for Ned Beatty.

53:35.320 --> 53:38.320
I think that's a lot of...

53:38.320 --> 53:40.320
Mr. Luthor!

53:40.320 --> 53:43.320
Sorry, I'm just trying to do my job.

53:43.320 --> 53:46.320
I know you hate Superman so much.

53:46.320 --> 53:48.320
All I want to do is just do my fucking job

53:48.320 --> 53:50.320
and make people happy.

53:50.320 --> 53:52.320
Yeah, I guess you do it for the good humans

53:52.320 --> 53:55.320
and then he is the force that...

53:55.320 --> 53:58.320
Superman can take a flying fucking fuck.

53:58.320 --> 54:01.320
The world's biggest donut.

54:01.320 --> 54:04.320
The only thing, if you listen to previous episodes of the show,

54:04.320 --> 54:07.320
I figured out, I didn't realize, I never understood it.

54:07.320 --> 54:12.320
Superman was created by two little Jewish brothers.

54:12.320 --> 54:16.320
They felt powerless, and they created it

54:16.320 --> 54:19.320
at a time when that really meant something.

54:19.320 --> 54:22.320
They were expressing something important.

54:22.320 --> 54:24.320
They pronounce it Superman.

54:24.320 --> 54:27.320
Which I believe is a polytechnic.

54:27.320 --> 54:30.320
I need to actually know that

54:30.320 --> 54:32.320
in order to appreciate Superman finally,

54:32.320 --> 54:35.320
but that means that when I'm looking at Superman,

54:35.320 --> 54:37.320
I'm actually thinking of those two kids.

54:37.320 --> 54:39.320
Superman can...

54:39.320 --> 54:41.320
Fuck you.

54:41.320 --> 54:43.320
Fuck that guy.

54:43.320 --> 54:45.320
If you approached and said,

54:45.320 --> 54:47.320
write a Superman movie,

54:47.320 --> 54:49.320
do you think you could make a Superman movie?

54:49.320 --> 54:51.320
I could make any movie, Jeff.

54:51.320 --> 54:53.320
Honestly...

54:53.320 --> 54:55.320
Try to fix Superman Force right now.

54:55.320 --> 54:57.320
What's your approach on Superman?

54:57.320 --> 55:00.320
Dan Harmon Fixes Movie!

55:13.320 --> 55:16.320
Faded on the Starfield.

55:16.320 --> 55:19.320
You know what? No, fuck that.

55:19.320 --> 55:22.320
Let's use some modern convention.

55:22.320 --> 55:24.320
Faded on a bank teller.

55:24.320 --> 55:26.320
Ugh, fuck.

55:26.320 --> 55:28.320
It's hard to work at a bank.

55:28.320 --> 55:31.320
Alright, I guess I'll just work at the bank again

55:31.320 --> 55:33.320
for the 150th day in a row.

55:33.320 --> 55:35.320
No actual change.

55:35.320 --> 55:38.320
Hey, yeah, you'd like to make a withdrawal?

55:38.320 --> 55:40.320
Yeah, and what amount?

55:40.320 --> 55:42.320
Everything you got!

55:42.320 --> 55:46.320
I said everybody, get down to the fucking floor!

55:46.320 --> 55:49.320
I want all your fucking money!

55:49.320 --> 55:52.320
I don't give a shit! You bunch of black women!

55:52.320 --> 55:54.320
He's a bad person.

55:54.320 --> 56:01.320
In a bad economy, you have to add that.

56:01.320 --> 56:03.320
Because otherwise people would be like,

56:03.320 --> 56:05.320
I'm on this guy's side.

56:05.320 --> 56:07.320
You black women, get on the floor!

56:07.320 --> 56:10.320
You fucking minorities and cripples!

56:10.320 --> 56:12.320
I want your money!

56:14.320 --> 56:20.320
You know, it's rude to ask for things without permission.

56:20.320 --> 56:22.320
What the fuck? Hey!

56:22.320 --> 56:26.320
Who are you, you fucking faggot pansy?

56:26.320 --> 56:29.320
Why are you wearing a faggot gay?

56:29.320 --> 56:31.320
Gay?

56:31.320 --> 56:33.320
Blue? Gay?

56:33.320 --> 56:39.320
I hate gay people outfit.

56:39.320 --> 56:41.320
That's all I have to wear.

56:41.320 --> 56:45.320
I didn't wake up, tried to make you happy.

56:45.320 --> 56:51.320
Well, you're gonna die making me mad!

56:51.320 --> 56:53.320
Close up of the bullet.

57:03.320 --> 57:08.320
What the fuck, you fucking faggot motherfucking faggot?

57:08.320 --> 57:12.320
I'm so angry, I'm fucking angry at faggots!

57:12.320 --> 57:18.320
I hate gay ass, homosexual faggots!

57:18.320 --> 57:27.320
You faggot fucking hate, I fucking hate faggots!

57:27.320 --> 57:30.320
Next time I suggest you explore your hatred of people

57:30.320 --> 57:32.320
who are different from you

57:32.320 --> 57:36.320
through more healthy means than rubbing a bank.

57:36.320 --> 57:39.320
Superman logo, cold open.

57:39.320 --> 57:41.320
Written by Dan Harmon.

57:41.320 --> 57:43.320
Directed by Dan Harmon, fuck it!

57:43.320 --> 57:52.320
Finally, I've had enough, I've had enough, I'll do it!

57:52.320 --> 57:54.320
Come out of the title sequence.

57:54.320 --> 57:56.320
You didn't think you'd ever see that guy again.

57:56.320 --> 57:57.320
But you do, it's on his face.

57:57.320 --> 58:01.320
It's Chris Pratt, he steals this movie.

58:01.320 --> 58:03.320
You faggot!

58:03.320 --> 58:07.320
You faggot homosexual faggot!

58:07.320 --> 58:12.320
Thanks Superman for arresting another bank robber.

58:12.320 --> 58:15.320
Guess this guy kind of hates gay people.

58:15.320 --> 58:18.320
Yeah, I don't get it really myself.

58:18.320 --> 58:20.320
Hey Superman, can you come to my office?

58:20.320 --> 58:23.320
Sure, Lieutenant.

58:23.320 --> 58:26.320
You're not gonna try to confine me to it

58:26.320 --> 58:29.320
and reveal a giant robot spider.

58:29.320 --> 58:31.320
No, Superman, I think we all agree

58:31.320 --> 58:34.320
that you're in control of the population.

58:34.320 --> 58:38.320
Just us ants making shit work.

58:38.320 --> 58:41.320
I would like to pretend that you're human.

58:41.320 --> 58:43.320
Sit down with you and talk to you.

58:43.320 --> 58:45.320
Detect a little bit of aggression.

58:45.320 --> 58:47.320
Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:47.320 --> 58:49.320
This is the way our last conversation went.

58:49.320 --> 58:50.320
Sit down.

58:50.320 --> 58:53.320
Pretend you ever need to sit.

58:53.320 --> 58:58.320
I know that if you and I had a standing contest,

58:58.320 --> 59:01.320
I'd turn into a skeleton.

59:01.320 --> 59:04.320
Just humor me.

59:04.320 --> 59:08.320
Do an impression of a person sitting.

59:08.320 --> 59:12.320
I can sense, you can sense everything!

59:12.320 --> 59:14.320
I'm sorry, sit down.

59:14.320 --> 59:16.320
Who plays this little Lieutenant?

59:16.320 --> 59:20.320
This is Gary Sneese.

59:20.320 --> 59:24.320
Superman, my job is twofold.

59:24.320 --> 59:28.320
Stop crime, which you have eliminated.

59:28.320 --> 59:32.320
Keep the peace, which you're exacerbating.

59:32.320 --> 59:33.320
What do you mean?

59:33.320 --> 59:35.320
I'm about to tell you.

59:35.320 --> 59:37.320
Everyone hates you.

59:37.320 --> 59:38.320
What do you mean?

59:38.320 --> 59:42.320
You're a pajama man from outer space.

59:42.320 --> 59:45.320
Society is built on the principle

59:45.320 --> 59:48.320
that if you work hard enough, you can become good.

59:48.320 --> 59:50.320
You drifted in from the clouds

59:50.320 --> 59:53.320
and are better than anyone can ever be.

59:53.320 --> 59:55.320
Every time someone tries to do something wrong,

59:55.320 --> 59:58.320
you beat them up with your eyebrow.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.320
As police chief, this poses a problem for me in the long term.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.320
I would like you to take a break.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.320
I would like you to go somewhere.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:11.320
Just let the city feel what it feels like to be human again.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:15.320
But I thought people like, just trust me.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.320
Go away.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.320
Just go away.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.320
Go sit in a rock and shit in a bag and eat it.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:28.320
If you care, if you care about humanity,

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.320
go fuck off.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.320
I'm afraid I can't do that.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.320
You just said, Superman, I'm going to pull out my iPhone.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.320
I'm going to record this conversation.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320
Is that okay?

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.320
Well, I have a photographic memory.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.320
It's for me, motherfucker.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.320
It's for me.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.320
Tell me you don't give a shit about metropolis.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.320
Tell me it's about you, motherfucker.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.320
I didn't say that.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.320
Tell me you refuse to leave.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.320
Tell me you refuse to leave.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.320
I live here.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.320
You, I'm asking you to leave.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.320
Do you hate crime?

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320
I don't think people should come in.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:06.320
Crime is happening still because of you.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.320
You make everyone feel weak.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.320
Everyone's going to keep acting out.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.320
Can you take a two week break?

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.320
Can we have a parade where you're not around?

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.320
Can we be flawed?

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.320
Can we be rougher on the edges?

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.320
Can you go away?

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.320
Do you have a mother?

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.320
Do you have an uncle?

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.320
Do you have a hobby?

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:28.320
Is it Gary Sidney's?

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.320
It might be me.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:34.320
It might be me.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:40.320
I need to hear more people than you say this.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.320
Okay, emergency town hall meeting.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.320
Yeah, get out of here.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.320
Get out.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.320
Boo.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.320
Get out.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.320
Boo. Boo. Boo. Boo.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.320
I don't understand.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.320
I don't understand.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.320
Why is everyone not like me?

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.320
I'm better than everyone.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.320
Yeah.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.320
You can't understand that.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.320
Get out.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.320
Okay, I'm leaving.

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.320
I'm leaving.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:10.320
Two weeks later, on Superman's chosen island,

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:16.320
where the indigenous population was just left.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:22.320
I guess I'll eat another coconut by opening it with my laser eyes.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.320
Oh, yeah, I don't need to eat anything.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.320
Here I am, the most Superman on island 134.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:38.320
Meanwhile, in Metropolis, hey, someone got mugged today.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.320
You know what?

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.320
They probably needed the money.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.320
You know what?

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.320
It's kind of an acceptable crime rate.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.320
Just the threat that Superman might ever come back

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:54.320
is actually putting us way above Flint, Michigan.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.320
This is great.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:01.320
Yeah, but Chief, Superman's due to come back next Thursday.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320
Fuck.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320
Shit.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.320
Who can kill Superman?

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.320
I can.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.320
Lex Luthor, yes.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.320
I have dedicated my life to figuring out how.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.320
How can you do it?

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.320
With this green knife.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.320
Okay, go do it.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320
NASA, can you help?

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320
Yeah, we're happy to.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.320
He's also putting us out of business.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.320
Here's the thing.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.320
Superman can't lie.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.320
Let's call him up.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.320
Hey, Superman.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:29.320
Or just talk like a dog and he'll hear us.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.320
Hey, Superman.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.320
Yeah, you know anything?

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.320
Anybody?

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.320
Giant robot spider?

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.320
Yeah, where are you?

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.320
West of Jamaica.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.320
Okay, we'll be right there.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:42.320
Go, go, go, go.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.320
I love coconut.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.320
Oh God, I got a stabbing me to death.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.320
With kryptonite, a kryptonite knife.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.320
My super heart.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.320
I won't beat anymore because it's been stabbed.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.320
No one's ever tried this.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.320
Just make a fucking knife out of kryptonite.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320
Stab him.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.320
Stab him.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320
Stab him.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.320
He's heart beat something's in there.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.320
He's not animated flesh.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.320
He's a super person.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.320
He has a heart somewhere.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.320
Stab him with kryptonite.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.320
Shank, shank, shank, shank.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.320
Stab, stab, stab, stab.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.320
Jeremy Renner's shaved head Jeremy Renner.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.320
I beat you.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.320
It's in the way that you use it.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.320
Credits.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.320
Credits.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.320
Yeah, credits.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.320
Death to Superman.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.320
Death to Superman.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.320
There's no Lois Lane in that movie?

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.320
Yeah, she, she, you know what?

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.320
I'll bring in a Lois Lane consultant.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.320
What do you mean?

01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.320
I'm just asking.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.320
I guess not.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.320
No, there's no Lois Lane.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:07.320
So we just root for like the lieutenant and Lex Luthor.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.320
What are all the people he saved throughout this time?

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.320
There's lots of people like that.

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.320
They went on with their lives.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.320
But wouldn't they be grateful and feel bad?

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.320
To what end?

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.320
Humanity.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.320
Well, they're going to show up every time Superman's in trouble now?

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.320
That's not saving.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.320
That town hall meeting, for instance,

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.320
when everyone's like boo boo boo,

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.320
wouldn't it be an old lady in the bag,

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.320
will he save my husband from falling off the seat?

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320
He saved me.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320
Right?

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.320
No, it's, it's, well, that was 20 minutes of my movies an hour and a half.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320
Okay.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.320
There's shit like that.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320
You...

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.320
Okay, okay, good.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.320
So there are people that...

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.320
No, it's a complicated film.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.320
Right.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.320
There are so many people who have a complicated relationship with Superman.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.320
I think it's a big role for Gary Sinise to tackle.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.320
Yeah.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:53.320
I'm out of breath just auditioning for it.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.320
Just knocking him out.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.320
All right.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.320
Jesus Christ.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.320
I just don't think that Superman's a compelling character.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.320
He's born too gifted.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.320
Is that a problem?

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.320
No.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.320
No.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.320
Nope.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.320
Nope.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.320
No.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.320
But I do think knowing that, like, you know,

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.320
if you know that the two Jewish kids made him,

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.320
I think that's heart-wrenching.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.320
Because they're like,

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.320
what if you were a fucking Superman and it's like,

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.320
holy shit, Jesus Christ,

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.320
I'm not going to take that away from you.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.320
Except you just did with a kryptonite knife.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:37.320
It's kind of a Nazi movie.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.320
It actually becomes like the,

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.320
yeah, you're right.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.320
No, you're right.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.320
That is terrible.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.320
That's the complicated thing.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.320
You took the only mythology the Jews have

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.320
when they rise up.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.320
Well, I take exception to that.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.320
I did not take the only mythology Jews have.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.320
Away from them.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.320
I mean, like superhero, like redemptive post-World War II,

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.320
like cultural shit.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.320
Yes.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.320
If you're a Superman fan,

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.320
I wouldn't mind talking to you.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.320
All right.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.320
All right.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.320
Fuck it.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.320
Get this guy up here.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.320
Come on up here.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:10.320
Get up here.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:16.320
And you're going to play D&D with us, too, so.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.320
He's got a Mega Man t-shirt.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.320
What's your name, sir?

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.320
Eric.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.320
Eric?

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.320
Actually, I write comics.

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.320
Now you're doing the thing.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.320
Okay.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:27.320
Like, I don't want to, we don't, I'm not bullying you,

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.320
but I've never had a conversation with anybody

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.320
that's done this.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.320
Your earlobes have the earrings in them

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.320
that, where you widen your earlobes.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.320
We do.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.320
What are those called, exactly?

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.320
Gages.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.320
It's like awesome marks.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.320
Gages.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.320
Awesome marks.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.320
Stretched ears, yeah.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.320
It's like a tribal kind of thing.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.320
But Superman, more importantly, Superman.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.320
No, what are they called?

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.320
They're called Gages.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.320
Stretched ears, they're called.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.320
Gage Deers.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.320
Gage is like an incremental movement.

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:52.320
Gage, yeah.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.320
It's like an inch or a mile.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.320
Gage means like the width.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.320
Okay.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.320
Stretched ears, yeah.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.320
Stretched ears.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.320
Now here's some questions.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.320
Do they ever come out?

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.320
Do you take them out at night and clean them

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.320
or do you just leave them in?

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.320
You want to find out?

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.320
The night is young.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.320
I'm going to fuck your earlobes, man.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.320
That's what I'm saying.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:15.320
I'll stretch your fucking ears.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.320
I'm going to fucking get you a bigger gauge,

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.320
motherfucker.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.320
Are you sick of those questions?

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.320
Your Aunt Trudy will ask that question.

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.320
I'm 16 and I'm like 28 now.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.320
You've been doing it that long.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.320
Well, I did it for like one year in high school.

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:30.320
I did that.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.320
I just always wonder, my big question,

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:36.320
I am your Aunt Trudy and I'm asking you,

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:39.320
tomorrow let's say you go, eh, forget it.

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.320
Now what happens?

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.320
Do they shrink?

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:42.320
Do they?

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.320
Well, I have tattoos, too.

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.320
I have a bunch of things that have done to my body,

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.320
permanently.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.320
But to the earlobes?

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.320
Oh, they just look wonky.

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:50.320
They look wonky already, obviously.

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.320
But yeah, they just, they heal weird.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.320
I'm not Wolverine, unfortunately.

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.320
I apologize.

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:59.320
I'm not like, I do a million things.

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.320
I'm mad if people ask me why I do them.

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.320
I'm literally only asking because I can't,

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.320
at the bar, I can't go up to somebody

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.320
and ask those questions.

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.320
So I thought I would take the opportunity

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.320
because it would be a tool if I did that.

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.320
And now I just offended somebody

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.320
by making that impression of a, yeah.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.320
But I, yeah, I just, you're the first person

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.320
I've ever actually had the opportunity to ask you.

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.320
All right, what was your name?

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:27.320
Eric.

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.320
Eric, all right.

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.320
So why were you up here again?

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.320
Superman.

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.320
Wow.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.320
Superman.

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.320
I had a question, actually.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.320
Make us like Superman.

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.320
All right, you have a question.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.320
Yeah, just as a person who is oftentimes like,

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.320
I see you as a Clark Kent type character.

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.320
You're an exceptional person.

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.320
And there are folks who hate you for trying

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.320
and they want to tear you down for daring to fly.

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.320
And that's kind of like Clark Kent's story.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.320
It's a man who's like trying to be his best self

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.320
and he made me a challenge again.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.320
But Clark Kent is a lie.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.320
Clark Kent isn't a real person.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.320
Well, no, he was born like, he was an adopted guy.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.320
Yeah, he grew up without powers

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.320
and he gradually grew into him.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.320
It's like puberty.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.320
But he was like, that was his identity.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.320
It wasn't like he's like,

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.320
now I'm going to hide his Clark Kent.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.320
He grew up as Clark Kent

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.320
and eventually formed the Superman identity.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.320
Okay, I never thought about it.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.320
I guess I knew that, but wasn't looking at that one.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320
Yeah, I didn't really think about it.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320
Well, the extra minute is who you are

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.320
when the cameras are on.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.320
It's your higher self.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320
It's him trying to be the best.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.320
Even Clark isn't really like that.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.320
He uses a different tone of voice.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.320
He parts his hair in a different part of his head.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.320
He dresses differently, obviously.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.320
It's him trying to be his best self

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.320
and putting his best foot forward.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.320
I think at home,

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.320
and the fortress will sell to you.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.320
I think he needs that

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.320
because he has the like,

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.320
oh, fuck, what am I doing?

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.320
I'm not sure, I understand.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.320
Yeah, well, I guess that makes it really interesting.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.320
The idea that he...

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.320
My question is what makes the character interesting

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.320
because my question is at a certain point

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.320
when he finally, for the fifth time,

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.320
realizes that he can go anywhere,

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.320
live anywhere, do whatever he wants.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.320
He can make his nose make money.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.320
Like, Superman just can do whatever he wants.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.320
He would crush a coal in a diamond.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:04.320
There's an emotional component of his actual...

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.320
He's like, yeah, but where's home?

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.320
Who am I?

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.320
Isn't that lonely?

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320
Haven't you ever like...

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320
I don't know.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.320
I used to have a girlfriend

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.320
who I loved dearly

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.320
who didn't really do the kind of things I did.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.320
He was kind of like a common person.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.320
There's nothing wrong with that,

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.320
but I wanted to do more.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.320
I wanted to move to LA.

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.320
I wanted to succeed in writing.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.320
And this person was just someone

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.320
who had like a menial kind of like Walmart job.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.320
And that was very lonely for me.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.320
I couldn't relate to her.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.320
And I see Clark Kent as that kind of like,

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.320
constantly ostracized by Lex Luthor

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.320
and those kind of like Twitter assholes.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.320
And then personally, like, his only friend is Batman.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.320
He's like the baddest ass guy in the world.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.320
Wait a minute.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.320
You're saying the best version of him

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.320
is the Clark Kent side of his life

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.320
because that's him trying to be human

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.320
and be loved and be...

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:51.320
He actually doesn't think of himself as Superman.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.320
I have to slick myself up in the morning

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320
to go outside and talk to people.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.320
I feel like that's him putting on the Superman ass.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.320
He believes that he is Clark Kent.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.320
That's who he is.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.320
Because that's what it says on his birth certificate

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.320
and that's what it says in his yearbook.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.320
So when he has to go into the phone booth

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.320
and become Superman, is he bummed out about that?

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320
Is that a burden for him?

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.320
I think it's just another role.

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.320
I don't think he really identifies as Superman.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.320
It's a job he has to do and he has to keep it separate from...

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.320
He's actually protecting Clark Kent.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320
I never looked at it that way.

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.320
All right, I like Superman now.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.320
Eric, everybody!

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.320
Wait, no, stay, Eric.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.320
Because we're going to play Dungeons and Dragons.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.320
How many characters do we need?

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.320
Well, we typically roll with four characters, but, you know...

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.320
So we need...

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.320
Not that I see gender, but let's get a young lady up here.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.320
Or an old lady.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.320
Not that I see age, either.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320
What did you say?

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.320
My lowest lane is here.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.320
But that would be unfair, wouldn't it?

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.320
We need to get someone else's lowest lane up here.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.320
Or someone who is their own She-Ra.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.320
Is there anyone who happened to...

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.320
Who happens to have more ovaries than testes that...

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.320
That wants to play D&D tonight?

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.320
No? Okay, good, fine.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.320
I saw you...

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.320
I saw you shrugging.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.320
You played before, right?

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.320
You've never played?

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.320
Who's back there?

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.320
I actually played once, too. I could swap out.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.320
Well, let's not unravel the whole carpet.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:29.320
Dan, is it all the counterintuitive?

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.320
Let's bring up his girlfriend.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.320
Is it your girlfriend?

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.320
Yeah.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.320
This is not the one the Walmart one.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.320
No, no.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.320
Thank God.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.320
Give it to someone else. I hang out at your house.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.320
Who isn't back there?

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.320
I saw a hand come up. Who is it?

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320
I thought I saw...

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.320
No?

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.320
Yes, yes, you.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:14:02.320
Come on up.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.320
What's your name?

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.320
Laurel.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.320
Laurel?

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.320
Laurel.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.320
Laurel.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.320
Oh, Laurel, sorry.

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:15.320
Have we met Laurel?

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.320
No, we have not.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.320
Okay. And Eric, okay.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.320
All right, thank you for coming up.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.320
Well, that was so arduous.

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.320
I wasn't here last week, and I forgot to listen to the episode,

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.320
so I don't know what happened.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.320
How did you forget?

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.320
I was out of town.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.320
I meant to listen to the next day, and I just got distracted.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.320
Then I forgot all about it.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.320
Okay.

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.320
I normally, when I'm not here, listen to the D&D part at least,

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.320
just so I'm caught up on that.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.320
All right, if you guys can figure this out.

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.320
One of you is Christopher Berg, and one of you is Mulray and Sedona.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.320
It's all made up.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.320
Eric and Laurel, are you familiar with these characters a bit?

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320
I am, yeah.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320
A little bit.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.320
Probably more than Dan and I.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.320
All right, yeah, hand me over the quarks.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.320
Yeah, grab yours off the top there.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.320
They're all cleverly placed in top to bottom.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320
Eric, you're Christopher Berg.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.320
Laurel, you're Mulray.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.320
You do Mulray in there?

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.320
Yeah.

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.320
This is exciting stuff.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.320
Shit, sir.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.320
You got mine too?

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.320
Take the top two sheets and pass them down.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.320
Okay, we did it.

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.320
This show is podcast gold.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.320
All right, guys, go ahead and see it.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.320
It was a harm and tell when you passed the papers around for two minutes.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.320
You didn't see it.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.320
You weren't there, man.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.320
You had to be there, man.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.320
You were passing you around.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.320
There was a lot of dead air.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.320
It was really good.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.320
There were six sheets and then four.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.320
Tell me about it.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:50.320
Tyler asked, he likes the idea that there's a Harmontown fan that talks like that.

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:56.320
Man, Harmontown was really rocking last night.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.320
It was a super outer space pajama man of episode.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.320
I didn't think Dan would pick Chili, but he picked it.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.320
They're goodness here.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.320
I think it's pretty amazing that not that it was a Herculean effort,

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.320
but that you softened Dan's dance on Superman in about eight sentences.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.320
It really did.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.320
Actually, yeah, that's true.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:21.320
It's just a matter of quickly shifting one important thing.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.320
But the fact that you don't take that away from Superman,

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:27.320
you don't remember it that way, that you've taken another stance on it.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.320
Yeah, well, because I was, yeah, I think we all, yeah.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.320
You think about it in terms of comic books that you may or may not have ever read,

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:39.320
and I think that, of course, I've never read a Superman comic book.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:43.320
I am familiar with Superman from a certain perspective,

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.320
and I always identify with the criminal.

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:46.320
No, Eric.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:49.320
Because I never actually, like, and I was aware that,

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:53.320
okay, yeah, he came down to Earth and he was raised by these kids,

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.320
these parents and small, but I never, something,

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.320
there was a tissue paper thin thing that needed to be poked through.

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.320
Somebody needed to go, no, he thinks he's Clark Kent.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.320
He doesn't think he's Superman.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.320
Now, Eric, I've only seen the movies.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.320
I've never read a Superman comic.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.320
What's coming through in the movies, do you think?

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.320
More so in the comics.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.320
I'm a big fan of the comics, the other Mark Wade stuff,

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.320
and Smallville was cool for Lex Luthor, too.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.320
They had the idea there that there was a guy who was very exceptional

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:20.320
and used to getting his own way, and, like, the Harvard graduate in the room,

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.320
and he was this new kid, and that was kind of fun in that series.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.320
But the idea that anyone, like, if someone else gets something,

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.320
they're not taking anything away from you,

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.320
and that's the central idea that Lex Luthor can't understand,

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.320
but, like, he can't just succeed alongside you.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.320
He has to have it all himself, and that's really compelling to me.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.320
But no, I don't think that they really delved into that, Jeff,

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.320
what you were asking about.

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:43.320
I don't think, like, they really dropped the ball with those narrative opportunities

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:48.320
because they don't really provide a good case on why he's alienated and stuff.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.320
They just make it seem like it's great,

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.320
and then in one scene it really sucks to be him,

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.320
and then it's great again.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.320
Well, and now he, like, murders dudes.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.320
Now he's super alone because he's, like, this ultra cop,

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.320
and he's the guy who's responsible.

01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.320
He's super dead.

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.320
He's responsible for everyone on the planet.

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.320
So now Lex is correct.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.320
That's weird.

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.320
He's no greater superhero than Iron Man.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.320
Well, agreed, yeah, naturally.

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.320
Because he's, like, super flawed.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.320
Because he's not a superhero.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.320
Yeah, he and Spider-Man are really relatable.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.320
He's a fucking human being that earned everything

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.320
and pays the price through alcoholism.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.320
He's, like, nothing.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.320
No radioactive spider, nothing.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:26.320
Like, I respect Spider-Man, but you get bit by a spider.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.320
Like, try being a dude.

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:31.320
But his dad was, like, a real, you know...

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.320
Yeah.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.320
He's pretty.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.320
He was raised by Howard Hughes.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.320
He went off.

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.320
Yeah.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.320
Yeah.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.320
He's gonna earn it all himself.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.320
Yeah.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.320
And those movies are fucking awesome.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.320
Yeah, no.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.320
Bring it on the third one.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.320
But, I mean...

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.320
I've never seen or read an Iron Man thing.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.320
So he was born wealthy, though, right?

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.320
Yeah.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.320
His dad was, like, almost as good of a genius as he was

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.320
and also pretty successful.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.320
That's as much of a radioactive spider as anything else.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.320
But now he's...

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.320
Right.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.320
But, okay, alright.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320
He's rebelling now, though.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.320
It's more like bad.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.320
Now he's a hero and giving back to humanity

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.320
because his dad just took...

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.320
Because that was, like, this kind of brand-based man.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.320
Tony Stark's dad, like...

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.320
Yeah, Tony Stark's dad is as good as Tony Stark, but...

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.320
But...

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.320
Okay, alright.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.320
Tony Stark is as smart as his dad, if not more.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.320
And fucking, like, took it and ran with it.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.320
Yeah.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.320
And, yeah, he's a solipsist and he's, like...

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.320
But his dad built weapons and, like, all their money comes from blood money.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.320
Yeah.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.320
So now he's now a son as a hero so he's gonna save people

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.320
with kind of a tone with that father.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.320
Yeah.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320
Alright.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.320
I'm gonna see those movies.

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.320
If you wanna borrow some comics, I mean...

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.320
Look, look, we're already dating.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.320
We've established that.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.320
I'm trying, man.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.320
In the morning when I'm leaving and I put a rose on your pillow,

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.320
I'm taking some of your comics with me.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.320
I'm making Tumblr jellies.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:49.320
Wait, you're making Tumblr jello?

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.320
Tumblr jellies.

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.320
Oh, okay, wow.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.320
I wanna try your famous Tumblr jello.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.320
Well, that's for breakfast.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.320
Alright, let's play some D&D for pity's sake.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.320
Alright.

01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.320
Alright.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.320
Last time on Harmontown.

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.320
After getting to the Floating Isle of Paradise,

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.320
our heroes met with the island's guardian,

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.320
Yomiji the Angel,

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.320
and together cured Chris de Burgh of his possession.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:19.320
However, in the process, they freed Admiral Darkstar.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:23.320
With his new ghastly form, Darkstar possessed Yomiji

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.320
and assaulted the gang mercilessly.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.320
Quark accidentally set the island on fire,

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:30.320
and Paradise began falling from the sky.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.320
Acting quickly, Moraine leapt for the portal,

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.320
catching the razor-sharp rim and pulling herself

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:38.320
into Bill Martigan's, and with her rope...

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.320
Our...

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.320
And with our rope,

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.320
managed to pull the rest of our heroes to safety.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.320
As Darkstar flew away and his heavenly host,

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.320
our hero relished their victory,

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.320
heading to the nearest tavern.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.320
There they encountered some gnomes and a small automaton,

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.320
and after a brief discussion,

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:57.320
Moraine held up the gnomes with her bows,

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.320
snatching away the machine's blueprints from the helpless gnomes,

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.320
while Quark grabbed the baby bot.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.320
But what would the gang do with the machine?

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.320
What if they got caught?

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.320
It's a fucking good episode I missed.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:12.320
Would our heroes be able to escape from Bill Martigan's

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.320
with their robot or their lives?

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.320
Let's find out now.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.320
Harmontown.

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.320
Thank you, Spencer.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.320
Okay.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.320
Helping no amount over here.

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.320
There's a robot?

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.320
A baby robot.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.320
A baby robot?

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.320
Was it in the bar?

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.320
Yeah.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.320
And what were the blueprints that we stole?

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.320
They were for the baby robot.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.320
There was baby blueprints.

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.320
Baby blueprints.

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.320
Baby robot blueprints.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.320
Rubber baby blueprints.

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.320
Rubber baby robot blueprints.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.320
Rubber baby robot blueprints.

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:50.320
And we wanted to steal these because we wanted a baby robot?

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.320
Yeah.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.320
Is there a baby robot or just the blueprints to make a baby robot?

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.320
There's also a baby robot.

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.320
And so these gnomes at the bar were hanging out

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.320
and they got a baby robot.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.320
Yeah.

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.320
And they have the blueprints to make another baby robot.

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.320
Yeah.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.320
But then Mulrainee held them up with her bow

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.320
and you grabbed the robot.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.320
All right.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.320
So I got the robot.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.320
Yeah.

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.320
Describe this robot for me please.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:14.320
It looks like a gnome if it were a child.

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.320
It's maybe two and a half feet tall.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.320
It's all silvery and it's got empty eye sockets

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.320
or you know, empty.

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.320
Okay.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.320
It also has a weird cavity in its chest

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.320
like something supposed to like fit in there.

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.320
Well you know what I'm going to do.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:37.320
You're not going to ask me twice.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:44.320
I don't fuck the baby robot's chest yet.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.320
I'm going to learn a little bit more about this baby robot.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.320
So the gnomes kind of stand with their hands up

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.320
all surrender style and they're like,

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.320
I don't know what to do because not to metagame

01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:01.320
but Kumail and Aaron where they instigated this robbery.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.320
The chapter ended with me going,

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.320
what the fuck?

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.320
So now we could have maybe purchased it

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.320
or they might have just given it to us or some shit.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.320
Well you guys don't have any money.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.320
Is this like Astro Boy?

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.320
Did they like lose their baby and they're building a new one?

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.320
It's like sad.

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.320
Those are great questions.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:21.320
I'm going to ask them like what this baby is.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.320
I asked the, how many gnomes are in the bar?

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.320
Three.

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:30.320
I asked these gnomes, who is the owner of this baby robot?

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.320
Hey Jack, take it easy.

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.320
It's all going to be okay.

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:39.320
I'd say put the baby down.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.320
I mean this is me talking.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:47.320
Look, I wasn't here so I hand the baby to you

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.320
and go do what you feel.

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.320
I've got the baby now I'm putting it down.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.320
I don't want to metagame but it wasn't me

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.320
that started this robbery.

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.320
You're having a quarrel of conscious with me.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.320
I never wanted to steal nothing from no one.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:09.320
I was appreciating the opportunity to be between adventures.

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.320
I certainly didn't want to start a new one by robbing anybody.

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:20.320
And even if I did, even if I did, I wouldn't have robbed a baby.

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:26.320
Even in a mystical Middle Earth realm that seems over the line.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.320
Here's your baby.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.320
My name is Sharpie.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:37.320
I'm going to go over there and I'm going to hang out by the jukebox.

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:40.320
Alright, I guess you give them their baby back.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.320
They want their baby back, baby back, baby back.

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.320
Fuck you.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.320
There isn't a jukebox.

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.320
I know.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.320
Just don't exist.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.320
Bartender, let's buy everybody here a round.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.320
You don't actually see any bartender.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.320
These three guys are the only ones in the room.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:06.320
I'd like to buy you all a drink for seeming like I was going to steal your baby.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:13.320
I'd feel a lot better if you could get your friend to a lower bow there.

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.320
Yeah, I'll lower my bow.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.320
Okay.

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:23.320
See, what happens is, non-nome people, we have...

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.320
Do you guys know what Jack Russell Terriers are?

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.320
No.

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.320
It's like a dog.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.320
It's beloved, but it's got a predilection for...

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.320
Oh, like a blink dog.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:42.320
Different breeds of man have different predilections for different obsessive behavior.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:49.320
We came in here for a drink and we just freaked out for a second.

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.320
Spencer, since I'm a gnome, do I have kind of an automatic in with these guys?

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.320
Is there some affinity there?

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.320
Or am I still kind of a potential threat because of avoidable...

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:00.320
I feel like you guys really burned through that.

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:05.320
Whatever equity I had has been wasted?

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.320
Yeah.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.320
All right.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.320
I say, I'm sorry, who is the owner of this baby?

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320
Oh, that's me.

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:12.320
What's your name, my friend?

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.320
Walt.

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.320
Walt?

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.320
Hey, I'm Quark.

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.320
Sorry about the whole...

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.320
Look, we've had a long day.

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.320
We just fell through paradise when we killed the big angel thing or whatever.

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.320
This is...

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.320
Admiral Darkstar has been up our dick for the fucking last couple years.

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:31.320
I gotta admit, it's pretty hard to connect with you guys emotionally.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.320
Look, I understand.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.320
We'll walk away, but we'll leave you guys to do your thing.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.320
I say we just leave these guys.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.320
Like, we never came in here.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.320
We never came in here.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.320
I give them...

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.320
I give them a dollar.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.320
I toss in my nutsack.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.320
I have a sack of nuts.

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.320
I give them my nutsack.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.320
I go, enjoy some nuts.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.320
It's pretty delicious.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:52.320
You know what?

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.320
I give them 50 feet of rope.

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:55.320
Really?

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.320
Yeah, because you never know.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.320
As you hand them 50 feet of rope, you hear behind you several footsteps.

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.320
Several sets of footsteps.

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.320
We're gonna need that rope.

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.320
I hang onto the rope, and I do one of these.

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.320
I go, if there's a motherfucker's creeping up on me, I'm keeping the rope.

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.320
That's what I do.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:15.320
And it's for the trailer.

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.320
That's pretty nice there.

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.320
Yeah.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:24.320
So you see behind you, three gnomes have walked in the front door.

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.320
They're looking pretty cool, cool dudes.

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.320
They're all wearing lime green scarves on their necks.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.320
Cool.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.320
Guys, what's up?

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.320
What are you guys doing in our turf?

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.320
Hey, here to buy you a drink?

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.320
Talk about being a gnome.

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:45.320
I got my gnome friend.

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:48.320
Hey!

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.320
We got gold.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320
We got silver.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320
We got stories.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.320
We got...

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.320
Wait, what?

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.320
Give it up.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.320
Give what up?

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.320
Gold silver stories.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.320
Let me start over.

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:02.320
We got gold for our own purposes.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.320
We have silver for our own purposes.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.320
I don't have any gold.

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.320
Do you have any gold?

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.320
Give it up.

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.320
You're robbing us?

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.320
Yeah, you're in our turf, boys.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.320
Some rough gnomes.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.320
All right.

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.320
Okay.

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.320
How close am I to this robot baby?

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.320
You're right up next to it.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:22.320
Describe the hole in the robot baby's chest.

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:29.320
It looks like it's meant to fit some sort of maybe like a saucer-shaped dick.

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.320
Dick.

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.320
Yeah.

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.320
Okay.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.320
I just want to be near that baby in case I want to grab that baby again.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.320
I'm not going to fuck the baby, everybody.

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:51.320
Okay, guys, guys, guys, I swear to God, I promise you that if we fight, you'll lose.

01:28:51.320 --> 01:29:01.320
But if we don't fight, I will give you...

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.320
What do I have wealth-wise?

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.320
What do I have?

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.320
I don't know.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.320
You don't know?

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.320
I'll give you 500 million gold pieces.

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:09.320
I mean, I don't think you have any gold.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.320
Oh, okay.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.320
Guys, I will give you...

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.320
I don't have anything?

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.320
I don't think you have gold.

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:17.320
We always forget to loot the people that we kill.

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.320
Yeah.

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.320
All right.

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.320
Here's what I'll do.

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.320
I'm going to give...

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:26.320
I'm going to tell you guys a riddle, and if you answer the riddle correctly, you can

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.320
have everything that I have.

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.320
Okay?

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.320
Hmm.

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.320
Everything.

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.320
All my possessions, all my clothes, everything.

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:34.320
Do you want to hear...

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.320
Do you want to do the riddle?

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.320
Well, I just want to take all your stuff anyway.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.320
You don't want to do the riddle?

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.320
Because if you don't do the riddle, we got to fight.

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:44.320
Well, this...

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.320
If you do the riddle and you guess it right, you could get it without a fight.

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:52.320
This is Bill Mardigans, the town of cigarettes and riddles.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:55.320
Yeah, so don't you want to do a riddle?

01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:57.320
I guess I do.

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.320
All right.

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.320
All right.

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.320
So, all right.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:13.320
What is smaller than a human but looks like a bloody skeleton?

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:24.320
Smaller than a...

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.320
A bloody skeleton of a half...

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.320
Like a fucked up...

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.320
Wait, what?

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.320
Sorry, I'm sorry.

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.320
A bloody skeleton of a half...

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.320
No, no, that's not true.

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.320
No.

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.320
That's not right.

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320
So, let's...

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.320
We're going to go past.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.320
Oh, no.

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.320
You could try, though.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.320
Wait, what?

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.320
No, no.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.320
Okay.

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.320
Well, you see...

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.320
Give us all stuff.

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.320
What's the answer to the riddle?

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.320
Oh.

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.320
Damn!

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:52.320
Kick their ass!

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.320
Flaming sword, cleave attack!

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.320
Say, which one?

01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:03.320
I go at the first two closest green scarf where I nose and I go for a cleave on them with my great sword.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.320
All right.

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:10.320
You leap towards with them with a flaming great sword with the intent to cleave, but as you do so, the two flanking,

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:15.320
the guy who's been talking loose, they're light crossbows into your flesh!

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:19.320
Light crossbows.

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:23.320
One of them misses, but the other does not miss, and it hits you.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:27.320
Dealing some seven damage.

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:33.320
At any rate, you launch yourselves towards the gnomes and slash.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:39.320
You slash the other one's neck, and his head pops clean off.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:41.320
The other one you just hit.

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.320
Let's see how much damage you've done.

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.320
So one guy's just done.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.320
Yeah, he's done.

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.320
You got critical hit.

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.320
What's your damage again?

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.320
Sorry, everybody.

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.320
It's 2d8, is it?

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:54.320
It's 2d8 plus 7.

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:55.320
Oh, wait.

01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:57.320
No, that was just 2d8.

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:01.320
It deals 11 damage to the other one, and he clutches his neck wound.

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:06.320
He's also got hit in the neck because they're the same height.

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.320
He just kind of falls down bleeding, I guess.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320
He's not dead, though.

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:12.320
Let's put it on Mulrange's turn.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.320
You got your bow out.

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:19.320
Yeah, I have my speedy longbow, and I use that to attack one of the other gnomes.

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:25.320
You fire it at one of the other gnomes, like the one that was talking, or the one that's bleeding, or the other ones.

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:29.320
I'll fire at one of the ones that came in from behind.

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.320
The guy that's not hit yet.

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:36.320
You fire the arrow, but something seems to have gone wrong.

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:41.320
Your bowstring snaps in the bow, and the arrow just kind of flies off.

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:46.320
It hits you in the eye, but not the tip, like just the side of the shaft.

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.320
Hits you right in the left eye near bowstring snaps.

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:53.320
It's going to take at least a turn to heal that.

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.320
Sounds about right.

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.320
Sorry.

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.320
That one was a critical fail, yeah.

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:04.320
So, putting it at, uh, Christopher's turn, yeah?

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:11.320
I thought the smoke bomb, like a ninja, for cover, and then I jump and grab the baby.

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:20.320
Unleashing a torrent of acrid smoke into the room, you use this cover to grab the baby.

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.320
What you do, now you hold it in your hands.

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.320
Uh, and then I hide.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:28.320
You retreat into the shadows.

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.320
He's a rogue.

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:35.320
You're the Steve Buscemi of this, uh, skirmish.

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:43.320
So that's a high cause fear.

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:49.320
That's what it'll look like if I'm successful.

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:55.320
All right, so the two guys that were already in the room before you came in, they just cower in fear,

01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:00.320
but the rest of the people aren't really affected, other than the dead guy.

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:03.320
All right!

01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.320
They're just cowering in fear.

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:07.320
So the first three guys that were there, it doesn't affect you.

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.320
Yeah.

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.320
But the ones that were already afraid.

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:13.320
The bleeding guy with green scarf and non-bleedy guy with green scarf, they're affected by it.

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.320
They weren't affected by it.

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.320
Green scarves weren't affected.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.320
Oh, so the other guys were?

01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:18.320
Yes.

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:22.320
These green scarves guys are so badass.

01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:28.320
So the rest of them, the guys that are scared, they just cower normal style.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.320
But the cactus bunch guy that's alive, he starts reloading his...

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.320
Oh yeah, I didn't even mention that.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:39.320
He goes, you will not mess with the cactus bunch!

01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.320
A guy in the front row called that.

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:42.320
Thank you.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.320
That guy's the guy I'm playing this whole thing for.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:46.320
I love it.

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.320
The whole reason I do it.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.320
Oh shit, you guys, this is fucking KB!

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.320
This is the cactus bunch.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.320
K?

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.320
They spell cactus with a K, you guys.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.320
Two.

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.320
Two Ks, as a matter of fact.

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.320
Yeah, this is fucking cactus bunch from Whittier.

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:05.320
You sliced this guy's head off and now we won't forget you guys.

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:08.320
The cactus bunches don't remember a face.

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.320
I mean, we do.

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.320
We also don't talk good.

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.320
Or spell cactus, right?

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.320
The one guy starts reloading his crossbow and the chatty guy,

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:24.320
he lunges at a Sharpie with a knife drawn.

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:28.320
And just like that, that's how his attack goes.

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:34.320
He kind of just goes at you and he stabs the air next to you.

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.320
Doesn't do anything.

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.320
The rest of the guys are just scared in the corner.

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:43.320
Do you have a comeback that sounded like you had something to say?

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.320
I said sup.

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.320
Sup.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.320
Not much, sup with you.

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.320
Well, we can just do this?

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.320
I don't know.

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.320
Why not, right?

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:54.320
Can we stop fighting?

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.320
Oh, oh, I thought you were just talking to me.

01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.320
Oh, no.

01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.320
Well, whatever.

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.320
I'm talking to the guys trying to stab me.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:01.320
It's fine, it's fine.

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:04.320
Sharpie, you don't talk to KB, man.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.320
Cactus bunch slice you.

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:10.320
They also take your bandana off and kick you in the chest.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:13.320
Putting it at a quark start.

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:16.320
Is my storage still flaming?

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.320
Yeah.

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:20.320
Where am I in relationship to the guy that's the chatty one,

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.320
the guy that came in the door?

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:23.320
He's behind you at this point.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.320
He ran at Sharpie.

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.320
Is he close enough to the bleeding guy for a clean attack?

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.320
No, no, no.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.320
That guy's healing himself.

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:36.320
Okay, well, I go up to the guy that's bleeding through the neck,

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:44.320
and I take the sword and go straight down from his head

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.320
and try to just bifurcate him.

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.320
Just to slice him in half.

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.320
Bifurcate him.

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.320
Man, this is my figuralization.

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.320
What was your word earlier?

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:55.320
Just general, what was your word?

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.320
Regularization in the chat.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.320
Regularization.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:59.320
Thanks.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.320
I'm going to bifurcate him.

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:03.320
Swinging with your sword.

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.320
Oh, shit.

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.320
You bifurcate him in tune.

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:10.320
Oh, fuck.

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:15.320
And that was also critical, yeah.

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.320
Wow, I'm on a roll.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.320
I guess you are.

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.320
I light a cigarette and just enjoy the moment.

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:26.320
That put a mole rain's turn.

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.320
Am I still injured from the Bowen?

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.320
No, but your bow, you'd have to use a weapon other than your bow

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.320
unless you wanted to restrain it.

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:41.320
I'll take my sword and attack the talky guy that hasn't been injured yet.

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.320
Grabbing your sword, you swing at the talky guy,

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:47.320
but you miss him.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:50.320
He seems to sway back with some words.

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:55.320
Oh, you got him swing with a different sword than that.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:00.320
He's got his cactus butt your fucking tongue.

01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.320
Yeah, putting it at a Christopher's turn.

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.320
I emerge from the shadows just enough to miss my face

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:07.320
and the creepy baby's face.

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.320
And I hold a vial of acid over the baby.

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.320
And I say, all right, motherfuckers, everybody be cool.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:15.320
And I try to sound like Samuel L. Jackson when I do it.

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.320
And I succeed.

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.320
Sounding like Samuel L. Jackson.

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.320
The rest of the people don't...

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:27.320
Oh, no, no, no. If you're going to do it, commit to it.

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:31.320
I want to hear this Samuel L. Jackson impression.

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.320
I'll pass, I'll pass.

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.320
You're kind of doing it there.

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.320
I'm tired of these motherfucking gnomes.

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:42.320
My motherfucking Yomiji plane or whatever.

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:45.320
Yomiji plane.

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:49.320
So you do that and those cowering gnomes that are all feared up,

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:53.320
they're all like, no, don't.

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:58.320
But the chatty gnomes like, man, I don't give a fuck.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.320
Oh, shit.

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.320
We're like arch enemies.

01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.320
No, we're like Pock and Biggie, that guy, man.

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:04.320
We're going to do it.

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:08.320
Also, I see you hiding.

01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:10.320
I see you frontin'.

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.320
Oh, shit.

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:17.320
Now it's personal.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.320
Put it at a...

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.320
Sharpies.

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:24.320
Oh, this is business.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:30.320
Shocking grass, motherfucker.

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:34.320
You grab him shockingly, but he manages to sway back

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:37.320
with some chatty words like, oh, man, your hand's so electric.

01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:39.320
I don't care.

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.320
Shit.

01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:43.320
Fuck.

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.320
He sways back and then he lunges again towards you

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.320
and he tries to whip his knife at your face.

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.320
Me?

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.320
Yep, he just throws it at you, though.

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:52.320
Shit.

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:57.320
He done hit you in the face.

01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.320
Dealing.

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:02.320
There's a critical hit, son.

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:03.320
Dealing.

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.320
13 damage.

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.320
I'll leave it to you to know if that means I'm dead.

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:10.320
Let's find out.

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.320
What's your max health?

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:15.320
My max health is...

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.320
I'll tell you later.

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.320
It seems relevant.

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.320
42.

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.320
It's 42.

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:25.320
Nah, you're probably at about 12 or 13.

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:29.320
But you stagger with your face all bled up.

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:34.320
Now he's disarmed, his knife's in your face.

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.320
Putting it at Quark's turn.

01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:40.320
I run over to Sharpie, take the knife out of his face

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.320
and plunge it in that motherfucker.

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:48.320
And I put it in the same spot in his face that Sharpie got it.

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:52.320
Or you would, but you trip and fall on Sharpie's face blood

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.320
in the ground.

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:58.320
The knife just goes skittering out the door.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.320
Jeff, are you doing something awesome?

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.320
Who's Jeff?

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.320
Who's Jeff?

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.320
Quark.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.320
Experience points.

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.320
It's not today.

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:14.320
Can I get myself righted or is that not my turn?

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.320
Wait, what?

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:18.320
Can I get myself back on my feet or does it move on?

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.320
No, no, no.

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.320
You're out of moves.

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.320
Okay.

01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:22.320
Putting it at Mulraine's turn.

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:25.320
So the knife is now out of...

01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.320
Yeah, it flew out of the bar.

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:31.320
Okay, so I'm going to take my whisper bow

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.320
and hopefully be successful this time

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:37.320
in trying to attack the gnome that just threw the knife.

01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:40.320
Attacking at the gnome, you shoot him right in the throat.

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:44.320
Damn!

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.320
And he takes eight damage.

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.320
All right.

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:50.320
Choking on his own blood, he falls to the floor going

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.320
Cactus.

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:55.320
Prickles.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:59.320
Stab all in the end.

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:02.320
Anybody get that?

01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:05.320
It's just some cactus bunch of bullshit.

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.320
Is he dead?

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.320
Yeah.

01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:10.320
So we got all the green scars, cactus bunch, guys?

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:15.320
The other gnomes cower in fear still.

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.320
I know, the fight's not over though, right?

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.320
Everyone's dead except for people that are cowering in fear.

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.320
Some people like that.

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:25.320
It's pretty over.

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:26.320
Christopher?

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:29.320
Yeah, so I hold the violet acid over the baby

01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:31.320
and I slowly walk out towards the door.

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:35.320
I go, all right, well, I have nothing else to say.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.320
You sure don't.

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.320
In his stead, I have a few words.

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:45.320
I can't see anything right now because as you can see,

01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.320
and I can't, my face has been stabbed.

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:52.320
But I will tell you what I can see.

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:57.320
I see a day when people don't fuck with each other.

01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:00.320
Maybe I'm an old dreamer.

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:03.320
I know what happened here today didn't have to happen.

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:05.320
We got a little out of control.

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.320
We wanted to steal your baby.

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.320
We stood down.

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.320
We gave you baby back.

01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:11.320
Some other fuckers came in, fucked with us.

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:13.320
Everyone's dead now.

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:16.320
My name's face bleeding, face bleed.

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:18.320
Not gonna give you my real name.

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:21.320
I want you to remember me as the face bleed guy.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.320
I can't see you.

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.320
I can't feel you.

01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.320
I'll never sympathize with you.

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.320
If I ever have to hear the name of this bar again,

01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:30.320
it burns to the ground.

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:36.320
For now, be content, for it to be coated in blood.

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:39.320
You stabbed my face.

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.320
Quark.

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:46.320
I go over there and take their scarves.

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.320
That, that.

01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.320
Oh, yeah, and I loot them.

01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.320
Thank you.

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.320
Wait, what?

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:57.320
I go over there and take all their shit.

01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.320
And I put what?

01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.320
Yeah, gold everything.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.320
I put one scarf around my head,

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:04.320
like, like, like Ralph Maccio and Crotty Kid.

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:07.320
And I put two around my leg, like two Scott Bayos.

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:10.320
Jesus.

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.320
I'm like, and I, and I, and I go,

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:12.320
you want these back?

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:16.320
You got to claim them from the new cactus bunch.

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:19.320
I'll tell you what, I don't know if anyone's listening to me

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:21.320
because I can't see because my face is stabbed.

01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:24.320
But I will tell you something that's tragically ironic

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.320
about what you're inspired here today.

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.320
We didn't come in here caring about finance.

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.320
To the point where we didn't have any.

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.320
These guys came in and asked for our gold.

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.320
We didn't have any.

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.320
Does that suggest anything to you?

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:37.320
We lived in a world without, without currency.

01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:44.320
From now on, we're robbing everyone.

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.320
Mulraine, go to the, you know,

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.320
equivalent of the cash register.

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:51.320
I can't, I got blood in my face.

01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:53.320
I got a knife wound in my face.

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.320
I can't see anything.

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.320
I just want to rob everyone here.

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.320
If you can hear me and you're not dead,

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:02.320
you're lucky, but you're broke.

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:03.320
Mulraine, Mulraine.

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:05.320
Is there a cash register in the place?

01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:06.320
There's money places.

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.320
Okay.

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:08.320
So you go there.

01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.320
I say, Chris de Burgh, go to the cowering guys

01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.320
because you're a thief.

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.320
Go get those guys.

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.320
I'll rob the dead.

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.320
On it.

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:16.320
On it.

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.320
Some of you are going to be left alive.

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:20.320
I want you to tell your friends about us.

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:21.320
We love money.

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.320
We love killing people.

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:24.320
We love robbing people.

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:27.320
We love money.

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:30.320
It's not, it's nothing new.

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.320
You'll remember it.

01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:35.320
I ran it down just in case they forget.

01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:36.320
Yeah.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:39.320
We're going to leave it on a note here for you.

01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:41.320
It's the same old songs.

01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:43.320
We love money.

01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:45.320
We love robbing people.

01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:46.320
What do we get Spencer?

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:47.320
Okay.

01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:52.320
So Mulraine in the cash till finds 300 gold pieces.

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:54.320
Yeah.

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:56.320
Chris de Burgh tries to mug these or tries to rob these people,

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.320
but they don't seem to have very much.

01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.320
You get about 17 silver.

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.320
You were robbing the dead.

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.320
I was robbing.

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.320
Cactus bunch.

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:05.320
Cactus bunch.

01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.320
All of them are dead.

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.320
You already got their green bandanas,

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:11.320
but they also have 120 gold between the two of,

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.320
or three of them.

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:15.320
And one of them has a strange stick

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:17.320
colored with yellow and red paint.

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.320
Who knows what that is?

01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:20.320
Ooh.

01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:26.320
He also has a card that says cactus bunch.

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.320
All right.

01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.320
I go over to Sharpie.

01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.320
I don't know much about looking at those sticks.

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.320
Do you feel any magic on this stick?

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:35.320
I got my blood is in my eyes.

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:37.320
Can you put it in my hand?

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.320
Yeah.

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.320
Put it in your hand.

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.320
All right.

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.320
I'm feeling it.

01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:43.320
Do I have a...

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:47.320
Do I have knowledge?

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.320
Arcana.

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.320
Come on.

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:52.320
You sense it arcana-ly,

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:55.320
but you don't turn anything up.

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:56.320
All right.

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.320
It seems like a stick.

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.320
I wouldn't throw it away.

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:01.320
I don't think people walk around with them

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.320
unless they're valuable.

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:04.320
I think maybe when we...

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320
How big is the stick?

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:08.320
It's maybe three inches.

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.320
It's a little stick.

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.320
All right.

01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:12.320
So we got the stick.

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:13.320
We got some money.

01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:14.320
You want me to hang onto this?

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:15.320
Hang onto it.

01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:16.320
I think, you know...

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.320
Let me try something.

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:22.320
And I thrust it and I put my magic energy into it.

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:25.320
And I pointed at the wall.

01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:27.320
Nothing.

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:30.320
I'm not going to call that a deal breaker.

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.320
I just wanted to make sure that...

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.320
Some of these things, they'll make a dinosaur.

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.320
All right.

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:36.320
Do we have the blueprints for the baby?

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:37.320
Do you guys want to pawn this?

01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.320
Yeah.

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.320
We got both of those things.

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:41.320
We got this robot baby.

01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:43.320
We got to find out how to work that thing.

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:44.320
We got the blueprints.

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.320
I look at the blueprints and see if there's anything

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.320
about that disc thing, the hole in it,

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.320
and see if there's anything that...

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.320
The stick thing?

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.320
Yeah.

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:53.320
It looks like there's a little arrow

01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.320
that points to the whole cavity.

01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.320
And then there's some gnomish words,

01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:01.320
and it's all like power, power, power.

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:03.320
It just says power three times.

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.320
What should go wrong, really?

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:07.320
We don't have the disc to put in the thing.

01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:08.320
I look around for the disc in the room

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.320
and see if there's anything to put in there.

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.320
No dice.

01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.320
I mean...

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.320
Then how do you know, man?

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:18.320
I rolled the dice.

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.320
A three-inch thing won't fit in there.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.320
No, it's saucer-shaped.

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:22.320
How big around is the hole?

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.320
Yeah, you know, like a fifth-shape, cup-shape size

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:27.320
bigger than a stick.

01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.320
Can I talk to the scared gnomes

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.320
and see if they can give us information

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.320
about what to put in the robot?

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.320
Yeah, they're just cowering.

01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:37.320
Ask them whatever you want.

01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.320
I'm going to ask them what we need to put in the robot.

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.320
I don't know, man.

01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.320
We didn't figure that part out.

01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:48.320
We just bought these on the gnome store.

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:52.320
I was going to say the internet.

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.320
All right, we need a cliffhanger here, you guys.

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:57.320
Fuck.

01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:01.320
I don't care how long it takes.

01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.320
I don't care what we have to do.

01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:08.320
You're going to get used to seeing my face

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:12.320
with its gaping knife wound.

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:16.320
You got to give us more information than that.

01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.320
Is the three-inch stick on the plans at all?

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.320
No.

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.320
Nope.

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.320
All right.

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.320
You bought a baby.

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.320
You don't know how to power it?

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.320
No.

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:28.320
Why did you buy this baby?

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.320
What do these things do?

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.320
What's the purpose of these things?

01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.320
They're supposed to, you know, be cool.

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:38.320
Like they serve drinks.

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.320
Why does it have to be a baby, then?

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.320
I mean, it's not really a...

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:45.320
It's like a Kirby?

01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:48.320
It does kind of look like a baby.

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:49.320
So you have a little baby rope

01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:51.320
that just to do stuff for you?

01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:53.320
Oh, no, man.

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.320
We're gnomes.

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:55.320
All right.

01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.320
Well, guess what, gnomes?

01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:59.320
Look, we're of the same breed and everything,

01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:00.320
but we're taking that baby

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.320
and we're going to get the hell out of here.

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.320
Well, we got it now, yeah.

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.320
Yeah.

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:06.320
All right.

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:07.320
Let's go, guys.

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.320
We walk out of the bar

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.320
and it's the slow-mo, stupid shot in every movie,

01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:12.320
like the right stuff and everything,

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:14.320
and we're walking down the main drag

01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:17.320
of Bill Martin against all four breasts.

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:18.320
Oh, yeah.

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.320
Oh, five of breasts.

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:20.320
We got that baby.

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:21.320
Wait, no.

01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:22.320
Is the baby working?

01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:23.320
Is he mobile?

01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:24.320
No, it's not turned on.

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.320
But then we slowly start running, right?

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.320
Like we look badass for a second,

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.320
but then we're going to really, really...

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.320
We're going to start running.

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.320
Right.

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.320
Because we didn't tie them up or anything.

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.320
We're going to just get out of here.

01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:36.320
Okay, no.

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:37.320
We're walking away

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:40.320
and we're doing the straight-to-camera walk

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.320
and slow-mo.

01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:42.320
And then...

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:43.320
Is my sword still flaming?

01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:44.320
Yeah.

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:49.320
I walk back and just touch the wall

01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:51.320
in the place and go,

01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:56.320
burn in paradise, motherfucker.

01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.320
That...

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.320
And then I turn to you.

01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:03.320
Sharpie's making a gape-mouth face.

01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.320
I go, you said we kill people now.

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:05.320
We're gang now.

01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:06.320
Come into it.

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:07.320
They helped us.

01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:08.320
No, they didn't do shit.

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.320
They called cactus bunch on our asses.

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.320
We tried to take their baby

01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:12.320
and they called it the fucking top.

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:14.320
They had a heart in their heart, man.

01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:15.320
We're bad people.

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.320
Well, they go put the milk.

01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.320
You're just a big monologue about

01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:19.320
how we're bad guys now.

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:20.320
We steal and we rock.

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:21.320
I'm just trying to make them not call...

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:22.320
Well, then we're burning.

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:26.320
Should I get them out of there?

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:27.320
I'll get them.

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.320
I'll get them.

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:29.320
Okay.

01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:30.320
I go in and I get them.

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:32.320
Geez, boy, mix messages, man.

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:34.320
I go in and I get them.

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.320
We're how good your monologues can be.

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.320
Guys, guys, we didn't want to burn you alive.

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.320
Come on.

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:40.320
Come on.

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:41.320
Get out of here.

01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:42.320
With...

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:43.320
Yeah.

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:44.320
They exit.

01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:45.320
Okay.

01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:46.320
All right.

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:47.320
You, you.

01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.320
Get out of here.

01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.320
All right.

01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:50.320
Okay.

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:51.320
Now, you ever tell anybody what happened here?

01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:52.320
Fucking skin you.

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:53.320
Skin your parents.

01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.320
Skin your cousins.

01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:55.320
If I can...

01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:56.320
If I can...

01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.320
Christmas time,

01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:58.320
five years from now,

01:51:58.320 --> 01:51:59.320
you'll think everything...

01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:01.320
There was just a weird thing that happened

01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.320
that traumatized you.

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.320
Your kid will be opening a present.

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:05.320
I'll come out.

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:09.320
And I'll explain to you what Christmas is.

01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:11.320
And then I'll skin everybody.

01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.320
So just, just live in terror,

01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:14.320
a vague terror.

01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:15.320
Not like a...

01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:17.320
Just a vague terror.

01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.320
Like, don't...

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.320
Like, go about your normal business.

01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:20.320
Be happy.

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:21.320
Fall in love.

01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:22.320
Have children.

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:24.320
But always have underneath there,

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:25.320
like a meta-traumatization.

01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:27.320
And I'll explain to you what Christmas is.

01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:29.320
And then I'll skin everybody.

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.320
So just, just live in terror,

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:32.320
like underneath there,

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:34.320
like a meta-channel of terror.

01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.320
Like the idea that I would come,

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.320
like I would be there,

01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:38.320
and I would hurt you.

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:39.320
Okay.

01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:40.320
All right, good.

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.320
And then,

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:42.320
then I think we always...

01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:43.320
Then we start running away.

01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.320
Now we're cool.

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:45.320
Now we're cool.

01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:46.320
Because,

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:47.320
because I noticed that in that building,

01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:48.320
there was,

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:49.320
there was alcohol and stuff like that.

01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:50.320
And it's,

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:51.320
it's gonna blow up

01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:52.320
in a pretty spectacular fashion.

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:53.320
They're fine now.

01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:54.320
They're fine.

01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:55.320
Get clear of the...

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:57.320
There's alcohol that's gonna blow up.

01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:00.320
The gnomes run off with vague terror in their hearts.

01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.320
And,

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:02.320
and then we're running away.

01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:03.320
And the things start,

01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.320
now the,

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.320
the building is fully,

01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:06.320
like it's on fire.

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:07.320
Like,

01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:08.320
is it fully...

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:09.320
Oh yeah.

01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:10.320
It's all caught up.

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:11.320
Yeah.

01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:12.320
On fire.

01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:13.320
All right.

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:14.320
And then it...

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.320
Then it blows up.

01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:16.320
Yeah!

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.320
Yeah!

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:18.320
All right.

01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:19.320
Wrong song.

01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:20.320
There we go.

01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:21.320
Harmontown, everybody.

01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:22.320
Thank you for coming so much.

01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.320
Thank you.

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.320
Let's take a look.

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:25.320
All right.

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:26.320
Thank you.

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:27.320
Thank you.

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:28.320
Thank you.

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.320
Thank you.

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:30.320
Thank you.

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:32.320
Let's take Laura and Eric.

01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:33.320
Good job.

01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.320
Laura for saving,

01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.320
saving the day in,

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:38.320
the D&D.

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.320
And Eric for saving our love of Superman.

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:41.320
Thank you Spencer Crinton.

01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:42.320
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:45.320
One more time for the mayor of Dan Harmon.

01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.320
Good night.

01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:47.320
Good night.

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:48.320
Good night.

01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.320
Good night.

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:50.320
Good night.

01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:51.320
Good night.

01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.320
Good night.

01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.320
Good night.

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:54.320
Good night.

01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:55.320
Good night.

01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:56.320
Good night.

01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:57.320
Good night.

01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:58.320
Good night.

01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.320
That'll do
