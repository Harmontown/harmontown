00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm not in the best of moods tonight, but I'm gonna rally and bring it back. You guys are gonna put me in a good mood, right?

00:29.000 --> 00:49.000
Harmontown is now in session! What? There you go, there you go. Okay, let's give it up. I'm Rob Schrab. I'm controlling again tonight. Let's give it up for our in-house dungeon master, Spencer Crittenden!

00:49.000 --> 01:02.000
Look at him. Looking all good. Looking all good. Got the ponytail to the side. Looking good, ma'am. Are you shrinking?

01:02.000 --> 01:19.000
No, I'm growing. It's a nightmare, man. I gotta die. Oh boy. I'm fat again. It sucks. I'm still fat. Let's give it up for the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon!

01:19.000 --> 01:42.000
Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon, Dan Harmon.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
No new taxes.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Five star stories, Uber driver.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Five star stories, Uber driver.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm looking at my notes.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Cut it. Thank you.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm sorry, you discussed what you wanted at the beginning of the show,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
and it totally left my brain.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Look, I'm giving you space.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm sensitive to you.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
I came into the green room and was like, hey, Rob,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I had an idea for tonight.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
It's like, whatever you want, man.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm like, all right, just a pitch.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
You don't have to do it.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
And he's like, whatever you want, man.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
I was like, well, do you want to double down on the moderator practice thing?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You're going to be moderating the Comic-Con panel.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
Everybody know that I'm moderating the Rick and Morty Q&A.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
You could introduce it as either the Harmontown panel

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
or the practice Rick and Morty panel,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
and in either case, bring people out.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
He's like, yeah, whatever you want.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm like, all right, what is going on?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
And an internet came out and I didn't give you anything you want.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah, I mean, it's fine.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Bad friend.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
That's what friends are for. I don't care.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Shitty friend.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Like I said to you back there, I don't give a fuck if you like my idea or not.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I don't like your idea.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
In fact, I was even thinking about that before.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
And then you went off on the thing that had you in a bad mood and you kind of lost yourself

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
and you went into autopilot out here and that's fine.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I can do that too.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Here's my autopilot.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I just go to my little notes here.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh, Bagel Boss.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Who hasn't heard enough about that guy?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Let's talk about him.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Did you see that video, that little guy?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I saw the video about that.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Here's the thing.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
His name isn't Bagel Boss.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Oh, I thought he was the Bagel Boss.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
He went to a place called Bagel Boss.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Am I saying Bagel, right?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
I don't even know.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
I wouldn't know.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Was I?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Bagel.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Bagel.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
What did I say?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Bagel.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Something.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Right?

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
You did a whole season of television off of that, right?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, because I don't know.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
I say the word Bagel and then people will alternatively go, you still see that or they'll go like,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
why are you saying it right now?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about unless I think about it.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I'm not going to think about the word Bagel.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
I'm tired of it.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Whatever.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Let's move on.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
This is not even worth.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
I was worried that little Bagel Boss, who's apparently not the boss.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
He's not the boss.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I was worried for five seconds that he would kill himself.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I think he's a viral guy.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
I think I heard that he's like one of these viral guys.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah, no.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
He's having a field check.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
No.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
He's one of these people who stages things and is like, ah.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
He's done videos before.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I think he's like the Nylon's boss or something.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
God damn it.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm sorry, Spencer.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm cutting you off.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Please don't.

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
Who's got the time, energy, or want to do anything?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
The little Bagel guy.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, but I look at that and I go, okay, I understand that on paper.

04:59.000 --> 05:07.000
But the sheer get up in the morning and the energy that he did.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
But if you have nothing else, I mean, if he could weld things.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
I thought it was interesting because he's like a part of his meme is that he was like,

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
when he yells at the guy, he goes, you're not God, my father.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
And then he kind of pauses for a second.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
He goes, we're my boss.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And I thought, why would you throw that in there?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I was like, oh, he's worried he's going to get fired.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Where does he work that crediting his boss right at the end there is going to make the

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
difference?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Spencer, I'm sorry.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
I thought he just read the sign on the wall and it was like, oh, right, boss, Bagel boss.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Oh, right, okay.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Anyways, we don't have to talk about Bagel boss.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Or my Bagel little guy.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm at an age now in a kind of world weariness where I was like, the worst thing about that

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
story was I was like, oh, this guy might kill himself.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Like, this is too much.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Like, because the video just has him cutting out.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
I worried about him for five seconds until you get the rest of the story.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And it turns out like, no, he's a pig and shit.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
He loves it.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
And then he's like, that was a big day for him.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
You're looking at one of the most important days of his life.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
You guys hear about this Gamer Girl bathwater?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
No.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
There's this Gamer Girl what's selling her bathwater.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
I like that you said it like a Jed Clampett from the Beverly Hillbillies.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
I love that what's.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Isn't that funny?

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
What's as, wait, what are we using what's as when we talk about a hillbilly?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Who is?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Sometimes you're like, that is.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
What's?

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Yeah, she sold two baths worth of water now, I understand.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
How big are they like energy shot bottles?

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
A bit bigger, like less than a pint of ice cream kind of size, but about there.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Like in a glass.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Is she hot?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Oh yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
I mean, I shouldn't say that.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
She's probably young.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
I don't think you're supposed to ask it or answer.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Well, I'm trying to.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Okay.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Let me ask you a different question.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Is he, is she dirty?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
I don't know.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Well, if she took a bath.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
How dirty is she?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Bathwater.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Well, that's, that's, that's good.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Terrific.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
They'll sell anything.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
They'll buy anything.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I bought, thank you for that segue.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I bought a $1,500 pool robot.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Not my pitches.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
God damn it.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Not my pitches.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
It's a pool robot?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Was it?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah, I bought one of those pool robots.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
It doesn't matter.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
How big is it?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
How tall?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
It's like a six feet tall.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
It's like a little dune buggy.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Right.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I've got the most expensive one.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I went to a pool supply store.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
And I think like pool supply store is like, they must exist in some kind of bubble where

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
people are calling them all the time for like free pool advice.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
I think like, if it was a doctor's office, they'd just be like, what's your insurance?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
And people would hang up.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
But a pool place you could just call and be like, hey, how many buckets of water?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Kill a spider.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
You know, I think I just, I got that impression because the phone was just ringing off the

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
hook the entire time I was there.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
And the guy kept answering and he'd go, uh-huh, uh-huh.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Hey, I actually have a customer in the store right now.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
So can I get back to you?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
And I kept wanting to go, you don't have a, I don't want anything from you.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I can see a fucking net on a stick.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Like I don't need your help.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Like you can talk on the phone all you want.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
I'm only here because I don't want to wait a day for the mail.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
And I bought a net on a stick and a pool robot.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
For the bees.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Yeah.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
A lot of insect life.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
You have a lot of bee problems.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
There's a lot of bees in the pool.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Bees in the pool.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Did you see I did a Austin Power as a bee t-shirt?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
I saw that t-shirt.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
I liked it.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I pressed the heart button for you.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
It's selling.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
It's really burning up the charts.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
Over at Schrab Home Video on my t-shirt page.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Hey, okay.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Do you have any of these, uh-

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Yes.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Polish moles, as they call them in Milwaukee.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
No.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Skin tags.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
You're not up for Polish descent.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
You know, I haven't had one in a really long time.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't-

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I got one on my-

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Fuck it.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
It's disgusting.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
You know what you do?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Just rip it off.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
Well, I wanted to ask you about it, but obviously you're going to give joke answers.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
You know what you do?

09:17.000 --> 09:24.000
You get dental floss, and you tie it up, and then it strangles it to death, and it falls off.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
But what about all the talk about, like the reason I have one dangling off of me is because

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
at some point in my life, like it injured my consciousness-

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
You were cursed.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
You're not supposed to fucking-

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
You're not supposed to touch them.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
You're not supposed to mess with them.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Well, I think they do tend to grow back, but I've read that about those things.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
They do fall off.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
They do fall off on their own.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
They can fall off.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.760
I had one of my collarbone ones that grew, and I was convinced I had cancer for a week,

09:45.760 --> 09:49.000
and then it just fell off one day.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
But I've got this one on my arm that-

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Is it new?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
It looks like a little Quato.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
No, it's very old.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Okay.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I'm just letting it-

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I'm giving it crackers.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
There's this-

09:58.000 --> 10:07.000
There's this wart remover that comes in like kind of like, you know, like when you spray

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
like air spray, like canned air, and you turn it upside down, and it feels cold, and then

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
blows out smoke.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.300
Yeah, you used to run around my apartment pretending to fart.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.300
You loved that.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.720
The day you found that out, if you held the can upside down, it would shoot visible like

10:21.720 --> 10:22.720
air out.

10:22.720 --> 10:23.720
It's pretty cool.

10:23.720 --> 10:24.720
And you would like-

10:24.720 --> 10:31.360
You went through a case of canned air, standing in doorways going like shooting like white

10:31.360 --> 10:32.360
smoke out of your butt.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.400
Does anybody have any canned air?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.960
I don't think they understand.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.840
Is there canned air in the building?

10:38.840 --> 10:41.960
Can somebody go get some canned air?

10:41.960 --> 10:45.040
I don't think I can visualize it if you hold it upside down, it makes sense.

10:45.040 --> 10:49.680
There's like this wart remover where what it does is like it's a little can of like

10:49.680 --> 10:50.680
whatever-

10:50.680 --> 10:51.680
It freezes it.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.680
It's not a wart.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.840
Well, but the thing is, is it'll freeze it and it'll fall off quicker.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.320
Okay, but you can just strangle it.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.320
It could cut it off.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.320
I'm told you're not supposed to-

10:59.320 --> 11:00.320
Yeah, but that'll hurt.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.320
If you freeze it off-

11:01.320 --> 11:02.320
I'm not worried about the pain.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.320
Then cut it off.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.320
Then pull it off.

11:04.320 --> 11:05.320
Then bite it off.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.320
That's okay.

11:06.320 --> 11:10.680
The reason I'm asking you is because in my mind, people don't touch them, don't fuck

11:10.680 --> 11:11.680
with them, right?

11:11.680 --> 11:12.680
Anybody?

11:12.680 --> 11:13.680
Yeah.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.000
It's been put in my head.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.600
I don't know if this is true or not, but it's in my head the idea that if you remove

11:19.600 --> 11:27.440
them, it could cause cancer.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.440
I mean-

11:28.440 --> 11:29.440
They're cancer minds?

11:29.440 --> 11:30.440
Well, that's gotta be-

11:30.440 --> 11:37.400
I'm hoping you're not a doctor because I don't want that to be totally true.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.440
I don't, I don't, I don't believe that.

11:40.440 --> 11:44.520
But that's sort of what I, I got the idea that what it is is that, well, those things

11:44.520 --> 11:48.000
are cells gone mad, which is what cancer is.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.720
But these things are contained at least to you, like your East European heritage in

11:52.720 --> 11:59.040
terms of like, I'll just put a bubble on this person's eyelid, just so they can get through

11:59.040 --> 12:00.800
this documentary about UFOs in Russia.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.800
Think about this.

12:01.800 --> 12:02.800
Think about this.

12:02.800 --> 12:03.800
Think about this.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.320
It's cancer that's trying to get out of your body.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.320
Right, exactly.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.320
And so when you-

12:08.320 --> 12:09.320
It's growing now.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.520
When you fuck with it, you're like actually hacking the mainframe of a thing that's already

12:12.520 --> 12:13.520
on the edge.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.280
It's like the Jack Nicholson of cells.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.440
And like, you don't want to give it an excuse to do witches of Eastwick.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.440
All right.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.440
I riffed that.

12:22.440 --> 12:27.320
Like, in the moment, I was kind of proud of it, but it's not like, it's not like, oh,

12:27.320 --> 12:32.920
which is Eastwick, and I was his Ishtar, and I was like, I don't know.

12:32.920 --> 12:33.920
Thanks.

12:33.920 --> 12:34.920
Thanks.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.640
Sometimes that's all we need.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.640
What?

12:37.640 --> 12:41.560
Just like one guy at medium volume saying, good.

12:41.560 --> 12:42.560
I like that.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.560
Yeah, I do.

12:43.560 --> 12:44.560
Yeah.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.560
I like that.

12:45.560 --> 12:46.560
It's good.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.560
It's good.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.120
Like, I'm actually now thinking in my head, does it need to be a guy?

12:50.120 --> 12:51.120
Could it be a woman?

12:51.120 --> 12:53.120
Would it be different if it was a woman?

12:53.120 --> 13:01.480
Because I know, I mean, I listened to Tori Amis for a lady going, good boy.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.600
That would be OK.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.560
That's a little bit of all right right there.

13:05.560 --> 13:06.560
I don't think it would work.

13:06.560 --> 13:11.640
I think I would project like Freudian impulses on it.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.840
I would be like, no, you're lying.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.840
They all lie.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.400
OK, too soon.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.520
Too common.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.520
Too common.

13:21.520 --> 13:22.520
Good damn.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.320
I don't think there's any more to pretend to be misogynist.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.960
But you can go down the street and get real misogyny anywhere.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.680
Why is your fake misogyny funny?

13:28.680 --> 13:29.680
It's not.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.760
Is there another show?

13:30.760 --> 13:31.760
Yeah.

13:31.760 --> 13:36.780
Like, it's Chuck E. T. he's going like, hey.

13:36.780 --> 13:38.640
Hey, you like, you like my dungle?

13:38.640 --> 13:39.640
Look at what?

13:39.640 --> 13:40.640
Yeah, what the fuck is that?

13:40.640 --> 13:42.040
I got this thing on Amazon.

13:42.040 --> 13:46.720
It's like, it's backing up my phone right now.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.680
It's 19.3% finished.

13:48.680 --> 13:49.680
To what?

13:49.680 --> 13:50.680
To it?

13:50.680 --> 13:51.680
Yeah.

13:51.680 --> 13:55.280
and it's got look it looks like a ninja star I don't know if that's racist to

13:55.280 --> 14:02.480
say now but it just it has like it's a four it's a four pronged thing like a

14:02.480 --> 14:08.200
like a cross kind of yeah it's got it's got a different it's got a micro USB a

14:08.200 --> 14:14.680
lightning a USB-C and a regular USB respectively as you go around the

14:14.680 --> 14:19.840
perimeter of the karate star and and it's it's plugged into my phone right now

14:19.840 --> 14:22.360
which means that right after I could pull this out and plug it into

14:22.360 --> 14:30.040
ostensibly an internet laptop yeah with even less storage than my phone

14:30.040 --> 14:33.800
anyways but once you start backing something up I can I can't pull this

14:33.800 --> 14:40.080
out no it's terrifying I don't know anything about the whole thing how many

14:40.080 --> 14:44.640
how many storages do you how many gigs are in each device that's attached well

14:44.640 --> 14:52.080
I'm I'm I'm maybe coining this phrase but I'm what you call a snowball in in

14:52.080 --> 14:56.880
the Apple douchebag community in that I bought the first iPhone and have bought

14:56.880 --> 15:02.040
every successive iPhone and have basically only ever transferred all of my

15:02.040 --> 15:08.640
information from my first iPhone to this iPhone I'm seven iPhones in and they

15:08.640 --> 15:14.880
keep expanding the storage so I have never like ever dumped my phone's content

15:14.880 --> 15:19.800
out anywhere for safekeeping so you're dodging the question wait sorry what

15:19.800 --> 15:24.360
what I how many how many storages do you have on it how many how many gigs is it

15:24.360 --> 15:27.920
backing up how many gigs can that device back I think this thing is smaller

15:27.920 --> 15:35.400
than my phone that's what I was guessing yeah but I'm hoping that maybe that just

15:35.400 --> 15:39.920
the photos just the photo roll oh if you could do that we'll just go on here yeah

15:39.920 --> 15:48.000
yeah yeah I mean we don't want to I do I got two hours baby I mean we don't have

15:48.000 --> 15:54.000
to talk about anything really I we could meditate yeah I'm pretty much done I've

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
been I've been binging the golden girls with with Cody which I know is like a

15:59.000 --> 16:03.480
kind of a hipster thing like you're supposed you know like oh yeah girls but

16:03.480 --> 16:11.480
but like as a sitcom writer of advancing age with a girlfriend who like would

16:11.480 --> 16:14.520
watch it with her parents I think when she was a kid or something it was

16:14.520 --> 16:17.720
nostalgic value for her but we will start watching it it was like you know

16:17.720 --> 16:21.440
it's like hate watching it first kind of like yeah he's old like who gives a

16:21.440 --> 16:27.060
shit fucking golden girls like golden girls and golden girls three or four

16:27.060 --> 16:30.000
episodes into the first season you're kind of like I think there's something

16:30.000 --> 16:35.640
special happening here it is I want to be very clear because we're you know we

16:35.640 --> 16:39.420
live in a culture where it's too it's too convenient for people to be like this

16:39.420 --> 16:44.440
is genius and you know like I don't know I mean look it television is a

16:44.440 --> 16:50.520
derivative medium the multi-camp sitcom is the worst of the worst but it's as

16:50.520 --> 16:56.720
far as like what you know on some spectrum of like I don't know fucking

16:56.720 --> 17:01.960
coolness you know you're dealing in drivel but like at the same time you

17:01.960 --> 17:05.080
have to recognize that there's a craft there like you you know when you've

17:05.080 --> 17:11.640
watched a shitty multi-cam sitcom versus a good one and and then and then

17:11.640 --> 17:15.360
there but then there's not just that one dial because I'm watching golden girls

17:15.360 --> 17:18.800
I'm like I would never I don't think I would stick with this for multiple

17:18.800 --> 17:23.560
episodes but I'm so old now that I was starting to like dial into this thing of

17:23.560 --> 17:28.160
like geez this thing is kind of genius just in it's I think like all I can I

17:28.160 --> 17:33.360
can do is it feels like a solar powered moped or something like it's take I was

17:33.360 --> 17:37.600
just like this show must be so fucking cheap like they never leave their house

17:37.600 --> 17:41.960
and they just keep talking about the same shit like one of them might get

17:41.960 --> 17:46.760
married and the other three are freaking out about it and like but it's like it

17:46.760 --> 17:50.600
just starts to like take on this like very you're like holy shit in terms of

17:50.600 --> 17:54.680
like the amount of energy going in versus the amount of energy coming out

17:54.680 --> 18:00.200
this thing is actually like a like a some miracle of sitcom technology like

18:00.200 --> 18:05.440
like a Dyson sphere but like with it it's just like what how is this so and it

18:05.440 --> 18:10.840
really does earn all of that like kind of you know hipster kind of like well

18:10.840 --> 18:15.440
it's pretty it is pretty progressive it means like all female cast plus they're

18:15.440 --> 18:21.240
all yeah older they're not fuckable which is pretty amazing what you guys

18:21.240 --> 18:28.360
really they're like oh you know I mean like when I wouldn't put it that harshly

18:28.360 --> 18:33.000
what if one of them is listening was that what that was they knew we're going

18:33.000 --> 18:36.480
into it that that's what I mean the only time is seriously the only time

18:36.480 --> 18:40.880
something like that will ever happen again is if they reboot golden girls

18:40.880 --> 18:45.640
right like there they'll nobody's gonna go let's get a bunch of we want the next

18:45.640 --> 18:50.480
golden girls or whatever I mean was designing women on the same network or

18:50.480 --> 18:54.720
was it like designing women was NBC I don't know what was what was golden girls

18:54.720 --> 18:59.800
then well I have no idea I don't really see the Tarantino episode of golden girl

18:59.800 --> 19:03.520
no I haven't seen that yet yeah he didn't write or direct it if that's what

19:03.520 --> 19:06.200
you're hoping but there is it you get through the first season and you can

19:06.200 --> 19:09.160
tell there's something magical while you watch a first season of a show and you

19:09.160 --> 19:15.160
can kind of see like like oh they're operating in total darkness like like

19:15.160 --> 19:20.000
they're on a soundstage somewhere and they they have no idea you know they

19:20.000 --> 19:24.400
like like they don't know they're gonna be syndicated they don't know there's

19:24.400 --> 19:27.760
probably who knows how these show you know they might have banked 25 episodes

19:27.760 --> 19:30.320
before they aired a single one I have no idea what the history of that show is but

19:30.320 --> 19:35.720
you know it's okay just a real almost criminal simplicity to the first season

19:35.720 --> 19:39.600
which is went through all 25 episodes and it's kind of like it was very

19:39.600 --> 19:43.360
interested too in this idea of like obviously that note of schmuck bait what

19:43.360 --> 19:48.200
didn't exist back then because golden girls is like season one is like if you

19:48.200 --> 19:52.720
were ever gonna get the note of schmuck bait from what do you mean schmuck bait

19:52.720 --> 19:58.800
schmuck bait is when is is just like in broadcast sitcoms it would be like a note

19:58.800 --> 20:04.720
you'd get that where like you can't expect the audience to believe their

20:04.720 --> 20:10.200
stakes here so like like oh Barney Miller is gonna retire in like an episode

20:10.200 --> 20:14.960
17 of Barney Miller where like what why would the show yeah it's like schmuck

20:14.960 --> 20:20.680
bait like we know that's not gonna happen so don't so like oh this is like do

20:20.680 --> 20:25.040
you think the audience is a schmuck like why would you be pretending that this

20:25.040 --> 20:37.240
is allowable as a good story oh shit kettle one the breakfast thank you guys

20:37.240 --> 20:44.920
son god this place is so fancy I don't know why I didn't know he was here kettle

20:44.920 --> 20:50.360
one audience zero yeah that was Jeff Davis for those of you

20:50.360 --> 20:55.920
Jeff Davis came in with a bucket of ice he presented the kettle one and Dan sat

20:55.920 --> 21:00.040
down you never got the schmuck bait note you got it when we were writing

21:00.040 --> 21:03.960
together we've got the schmuck bait no it kind of goes hand-in-hand with the

21:03.960 --> 21:08.040
should I stay or should I go which is like that's that's like a category of

21:08.040 --> 21:12.480
schmuck bait where if you're writing a pilot like I like you can't you can't

21:12.480 --> 21:17.720
spend your pilot having the protagonist go I don't know should I be here or not

21:17.720 --> 21:24.440
like oh maybe I shouldn't be here it's like hey schmuck like they're obviously

21:24.440 --> 21:28.320
their faces on the poster and in all the commercials like we know that Diane's

21:28.320 --> 21:33.080
gonna keep working at Cheers stop it but but they she stopped they did it back

21:33.080 --> 21:38.720
them they got away with it and it's okay it's kind of it's fun to look at and go

21:38.720 --> 21:42.120
like damn they didn't have that note to contend with so they were able to tell

21:42.120 --> 21:47.080
like simpler stories where it was just like every fucking week one of the

21:47.080 --> 21:49.680
golden girls was worried that one of the other golden girls was gonna move out

21:49.680 --> 21:53.800
and it was like come on that's the one thing we know can't happen but anyways

21:53.800 --> 21:58.920
but the thing I wanted to talk about was yeah I was hoping this one out Jeff

21:58.920 --> 22:06.000
Davis just walked out I hope he just keeps bringing things making the the

22:06.000 --> 22:13.880
ice bucket yeah presentable thank you very much Jeff just left if you're an

22:13.880 --> 22:19.680
aficionado if you're like an aspiring TV writer or something like that I don't

22:19.680 --> 22:23.520
recommend this for everybody I'm not a foodie of television I'm not learn to

22:23.520 --> 22:28.280
swim but I think if you're an aspiring like sitcom writer if that if that craft

22:28.280 --> 22:33.400
is gonna stick around but whatever I think the wash dishes season season two

22:33.400 --> 22:39.640
episode one of the golden girls very interesting learn to paint obviously

22:39.640 --> 22:44.960
they took a break obviously then the reviews were probably like holy shit

22:44.960 --> 22:48.760
these guys are great together there's something really amazing about this show

22:48.760 --> 22:53.240
it's working really well we love it we love it it probably wasn't like bet

22:53.240 --> 22:58.520
heavily on the budget was low probably the and then it was like explosively

22:58.520 --> 23:04.560
popular and then like one can only imagine who knows you can speculate

23:04.560 --> 23:09.720
forever and then like so that season two starts with episode one and it's like

23:09.720 --> 23:14.520

you've been into it you know like how just like kind of provincial it was it

23:30.280 --> 23:32.600
was like they just went back and forth from the living room to the kitchen in

23:32.600 --> 23:37.960

they're like they're like oh god we're never gonna finish these mink cages on

23:54.680 --> 23:58.200
time and dirty going to them who thought of going into the mink business and it's

23:58.200 --> 24:02.120
like it's not even if it's not even an episode about going into the mink they've

24:02.120 --> 24:06.680
gone into the mink business that's the crazy it's not an episode about them

24:06.680 --> 24:13.600
deciding to go into it they're gonna sell mink it turns out to have nothing to

24:13.600 --> 24:17.040

episode you're not the kind of person that I'm worried about offending but like

24:34.400 --> 24:39.040
I I like like because I think that anyway that worked on that show would they

24:39.040 --> 24:45.560
have to there has to be a story behind anybody anybody that can write a show

24:45.560 --> 24:52.400

people that never even bothered to send an emoji because they're that most

27:52.000 --> 27:56.600
people don't like they they see something for 30 seconds that you make

or a minute or five minutes or 20 minutes or a hundred episodes or 20

28:00.520 --> 28:06.240
episodes or like like overhearing in a fucking can restaurant where you're

28:06.240 --> 28:23.320
being funny and I like it Davis yes and you take in carbon dioxide and you put

28:23.320 --> 28:28.680
out oxygen in a world that usually does the opposite and you sleep like a baby

28:28.680 --> 28:34.160
you go like I don't have to care about all this other shit I drink poison I put

28:34.160 --> 28:43.560
out purified air like it's a good gig you don't have to lift any boxes no I'm

28:43.560 --> 28:48.320
not high-roading you I'm just saying like you know yeah I just it's I'm tired

28:48.320 --> 28:55.560
I'm tired of it I want you to tell me specifically that I need I need you as

28:55.560 --> 29:02.960
your therapist I need you to name your your goal like you're saying I don't

29:02.960 --> 29:07.080
know anymore I don't know right I really don't know well that's a ticket to

29:07.080 --> 29:12.240
depression and I mean that's I don't know I mean I thought I did and you know

29:12.240 --> 29:17.960
but it just seems then then I mean I then I only would say is then that's like

29:17.960 --> 29:20.920
sometimes we go through those phases where we don't know what we want and

29:20.920 --> 29:24.800
those are those are you know the grass is always greener but there's a lot of

29:24.800 --> 29:28.240
people who know what they want who when they look at people who don't know what

29:28.240 --> 29:34.440
they want are like must be nice like because they like they know for sure

29:34.440 --> 29:39.200
that all they have to do before they can fucking relax is get these MRI results

29:39.200 --> 29:44.560
or like finish this internship or turn in this theme paper or whatever the fuck

29:44.560 --> 29:50.360
poor people do the and they they have that they're locked in that maze and all

29:50.360 --> 29:54.240
they can look forward to is like this for like for a lot of Americans it's the

29:54.240 --> 29:57.600
myth of retirement for but we're all doing it to ourselves every day we're

29:57.600 --> 30:02.840
like I just got to get this and then we're gonna find out who regarding

30:02.840 --> 30:07.600
Henry really is you know like what kind of rich crackers am I into like it's a

30:07.600 --> 30:15.600
good movie you should check it out so you're in a place when you're feeling

30:15.600 --> 30:20.960
like this where you get to now just fucking I mean the thing that you're

30:20.960 --> 30:28.400
depressed about is it's bad you should be depressed about being depressed about

30:28.400 --> 30:33.920
that because that makes you a loser I heard about it and I was like what a

30:33.920 --> 30:40.520
loser I appreciate that and I understand that but it's it's a symptom of a

30:40.520 --> 30:45.320
greater thing if you're my therapist you know that already yeah come on I thought

30:45.320 --> 30:50.360
I'm talking about the greater thing yeah and so am I yeah like I think you're in

30:50.360 --> 30:55.240
a good you should well I'm not saying you should be happy oh shit what could

30:55.240 --> 31:02.000
happen what could happen a tie could go on the lampshade oh wait a minute the

31:02.000 --> 31:09.480
lampshade lampshade is the neck what what head could come next I don't I don't

31:09.480 --> 31:14.800
think he can do it I don't think there's a head oh but I shudder to wait I don't

31:14.800 --> 31:21.240
think the head can fit on top of that you hear that Jeff that's a challenge man

31:21.240 --> 31:27.380
also like the lampshade could go upside down but then the tie wouldn't fit why

31:27.380 --> 31:31.560
would you put the lampshade upside down it would be easier it would fit easier

31:31.560 --> 31:35.960
over the top of the bottle really it's oh yeah I could demonstrate but why would

31:35.960 --> 31:40.600
I do that well it's looking like it's working right I know I'm not I'm not

31:40.600 --> 31:44.240
trying to everybody listening at home I like the idea well there's what there's

31:44.240 --> 31:48.800
yeah but let's not talk about anything other than Jeff's bit until Jeff comes

31:48.800 --> 31:53.440
out again that would be good go because so that he's not taking focus from

31:53.440 --> 32:00.240
anything he has to slowly eat himself I think that's happening yeah that's why

32:00.240 --> 32:06.440
I'm not eager to move on we should ask Jeff he's got shoes okay now he's

32:06.440 --> 32:11.200
putting shoes out and they're at the foot of the chair what kind of golem are

32:11.200 --> 32:19.000
you making you guys know about this golem the Jewish golem you put like a

32:19.000 --> 32:23.040
slip of paper in its mouth the thing it says you say you know about the golem

32:23.040 --> 32:27.920
oh leavey knows all about it leavey hey leavey you're Jewish tell me about the

32:27.920 --> 32:37.240
golem is that like your Santa Claus come on yeah that's true golem is made out

32:37.240 --> 32:42.720
of clay made out of clay basically the first robot yeah right made out of clay

32:42.720 --> 32:48.080
it's a clay robot and it's infused with Jew magic and it hunts down alchemy I

32:48.080 --> 32:56.080
think you have to say the whole word Jew magic I think you got it I think you

32:56.080 --> 33:02.400
can't I think the key is yeah you're gonna add the issue magic otherwise when

33:02.400 --> 33:06.880
you're using it as a descriptor you can't just stop at the shoe like you can't be

33:06.880 --> 33:14.400
like I got in one of those Jew limousines this is based on fact a golem is

33:14.400 --> 33:18.160
made out of Jew magic you can't know I mean I'm just I'm just telling you

33:18.160 --> 33:22.960
linguistically what I've come to find I think is like the you know like it's a

33:22.960 --> 33:29.520
new I should be saying Jewish or Hebrew magic I was yeah great this is a clay

33:29.520 --> 33:40.440
made robot infused with Hebrew magic thank you brought to life via the Hebrew

33:40.440 --> 33:46.120
faith you did a really funny thing the other day when I left your house side

33:46.120 --> 33:52.640
oh yeah that was I leave the house no you don't want me to do it well come on

33:52.640 --> 33:57.080
like I come on did you okay I won't do it I want to do it I'm scared to do it

33:57.080 --> 34:02.680
okay yeah no no it's sorry like we've entered a time when we can't okay I

34:02.680 --> 34:08.520
won't do it I won't do it okay I'll tell you after the show it was just a bit for

34:08.520 --> 34:16.640
Schraban it's okay so it's a golem is a alright I'll tell okay okay you know it's

34:16.640 --> 34:21.160
we got okay but look you let me tell it so that I can protect myself a little

34:21.160 --> 34:29.240
bit in my mind just locker room humor it was a little boy who was like

34:29.240 --> 34:34.960
scooting past Rob's car on this like crazy contraption that like has like

34:34.960 --> 34:39.280
this like like 90 wheels and like a big boomerang handlebar or something and

34:39.280 --> 34:44.360
he was like a very well-dressed boy with like it was Saturday it might have been

34:44.360 --> 34:50.400
what do you call it Shabbat or something he had a yama Khan and and he he was

34:50.400 --> 34:54.480
riding on this crazy contraption and Schrab said as the little boy rode by is

34:54.480 --> 34:58.160
like wait what do you call that thing and the kid was like a yanger flanger or

34:58.160 --> 35:01.840
whatever the thing is called the brand name and Schrab's like maybe you should

35:01.840 --> 35:05.400
get one of those to me and I'm like why are you doing this to me and just leave

35:05.400 --> 35:09.040
and then and then I went back inside and I just knew I do the timing of it because

35:09.040 --> 35:11.800
Rob would be like on the freeway by the time I texted and I was just like I

35:11.800 --> 35:18.320
thought they were called yama cuz if you said to the kid like what is those

35:18.320 --> 35:22.520
things called and he was like a yanger flanger and it was like as if they were

35:22.520 --> 35:29.880
talking about his hat I just thought the timing of it would be funny cuz it

35:29.880 --> 35:34.880
would be like a big long pause okay is this a good bit okay I've got a bit for

35:34.880 --> 35:40.080
you okay it's tell me and maybe we can workshop this hopefully it'll be better

35:40.080 --> 35:45.520
than the show fun thing from last week but okay so this is an announcer who's

35:45.520 --> 35:58.600
does inappropriate pronunciations okay all right coming this Easter Sunday ABC

35:58.600 --> 36:05.360
proudly presents the life and times of Jesus Christ

36:05.360 --> 36:16.840
starring Willem Dafoe is punches pilot Catherine DeNove is Mary Magdalene yeah

36:16.840 --> 36:25.720
and John reels back is Jesus Christ it's nice simple there's something in there

36:25.720 --> 36:31.200
I call that like 24 carat dad humor like good dad humor like dads are funny

36:31.200 --> 36:36.680
sometimes I call it really cool sexy I'm not bald humor

36:36.680 --> 36:40.560
why is it that I mean like this has happened in the last five years and I

36:40.560 --> 36:44.720
guess it's because I'm older everything I'm doing is dad humor that's what Cody

36:44.720 --> 36:49.560
said I'm embracing it I mean I truly honestly I just means I'm on I'm on the

36:49.560 --> 36:54.360
way out well I don't have any no no no that's not true at all I think dad

36:54.360 --> 36:59.640
humor is coming true it's not getting younger it's not our job after the age

36:59.640 --> 37:09.920
of 40 it's not our job oh he put a drinking cup oh boy oh we'll make it

37:09.920 --> 37:18.760
work we have to we have to ignore him it's not it's it's not our job after the

37:18.760 --> 37:23.880
age of 40 to be as to compete with 25 year olds in terms of like they're gonna

37:23.880 --> 37:29.840
like like why yes like like let them like understand what Tinder is let alone

37:29.840 --> 37:34.440
what a funny or a hack joke is about Tinder like we're not gonna compete with

37:34.440 --> 37:41.280
that but that's not the same as being like out of business like you as you

37:41.280 --> 37:49.120
lose your your real-time edge you gain all this other shit like you you're like

37:49.120 --> 37:54.600
did it folks you you and one and one of the chief things you gain is fucking

37:54.600 --> 38:01.240
calm confidence because because because because charismatic 25 year olds are

38:01.240 --> 38:05.120
ones that that that create the impression that they give zero fucks and

38:05.120 --> 38:10.080
when you're 45 you can you you have an opportunity to actually give zero fucks

38:10.080 --> 38:16.720
and and and that can be helpful to a younger generation too you know so like

38:16.720 --> 38:20.840
I like the dad joke I mean yeah I'm like I'm like I like say the most the

38:20.840 --> 38:24.480
dumbest things I'm just like giddy like I just like smelling my own farts like

38:24.480 --> 38:29.680
Cody I'll say something other than I'll like make the dumbest Schrabby joke oof

38:29.680 --> 38:35.520
gotta hurt well you know I kind of it doesn't hurt because I go out of my

38:35.520 --> 38:40.320
way dumb and I think it's interesting because I don't think I don't think dad

38:40.320 --> 38:43.800
jokes come as a result of having a kid I think dad jokes come as a result of

38:43.800 --> 38:48.320
being a certain age I think you like Gandalf of the white comedically which

38:48.320 --> 38:52.200
means that you just like I don't even have to be that intense about fighting a

38:52.200 --> 38:55.080
ball rock anymore I could just be like I'm here again

38:55.080 --> 39:03.080
well while you were having an adventure I went and talked to the devil we made

39:03.080 --> 39:07.960
an agreement I don't really give a fuck I got my own franchise off to the side

39:07.960 --> 39:14.520
no one ever watches who knows what's under this robe is my dick have a big

39:14.520 --> 39:21.240
white beard did you know wizards aren't even the same race as man in the

39:21.240 --> 39:26.200
Tolka verse it's weird they're like angels do you know that Schrab no I never

39:26.200 --> 39:33.240
got past the hobbit yeah it's true why you know when he fought ball rock that

39:33.240 --> 39:37.560
was like a big deal after after he fell down shit was still happening down

39:37.560 --> 39:44.960
there is his name ball rock or is he a ball rock I think he's the ball rock I

39:44.960 --> 39:50.400
think there might be multiple ball rocks then someone said two people said yes to

39:50.400 --> 39:55.400
what to there being multiple ball rocks like he's a bad angel so he's a race of

39:55.400 --> 39:59.520
ball rock well I think I think they're like I can't remember the name of them

39:59.520 --> 40:03.280
but they're like spirits they're like angels of the good God or whatever the

40:03.280 --> 40:08.040
fuck and then the ball rugs are like angels of the the bad God who is not

40:08.040 --> 40:16.400
Sauron right he's like oh here we go yeah don't punish him he's being helpful

40:16.400 --> 40:21.640
what could come after the the drinking cap excuse me there's more than one

40:21.640 --> 40:27.800
ring each one of the don't let him bully you whoever I welcomed your I don't like

40:27.800 --> 40:31.680
yeah I wanted the rings to like oh one like you know makes you float or

40:31.680 --> 40:35.280
something you know that would have been fucking cool I'll never understand what

40:35.280 --> 40:38.880
the fuck was so powerful about that ring I mean I get it it's powerful to be

40:38.880 --> 40:42.720
invisible but it makes you puke and turn into a Dracula that lets you control

40:42.720 --> 40:47.440
ring rates yeah it's not a real standard invisibility it's like fun for like ten

44:23.560 --> 44:33.320

your own text messages to remember what is anybody do people go through this a

44:59.840 --> 45:03.760
lot I mean my whole life I've always known what I wanted to do and then in

45:03.760 --> 45:09.520
the last like three years I've gone I don't know anymore I think that happens

45:09.520 --> 45:16.360
yeah and it's and it's it sucks because you just you don't have you don't have

45:16.360 --> 45:22.280
an X on your treasure map anymore and most people would say I mean would say

45:22.280 --> 45:26.000
that's actually a good thing because life can be exciting again because that's

45:26.000 --> 45:30.680
everyone's X yeah yeah I know I know I know I know I know I know but I've been

45:30.680 --> 45:35.400
always unfortunately and this is a problem my life I've go always gone well

45:35.400 --> 45:40.360
I'll do this and then after that I'll do be able to do what I really want to do

45:40.360 --> 45:48.320
and I've been following that carrot for 20 years so it's and I've found found

45:48.320 --> 45:53.720
out that there's no carrot well now I'm like well now what and I've wasted my

45:53.720 --> 45:58.960
time searching you know waste your time but like wasted but I but I'm I'm lost

45:58.960 --> 46:03.760
I don't know how do you even Bob Dylan is that a guy I think Bob Dylan like he

46:03.760 --> 46:08.440
like puts metal together like he's like a good singing guy and he's like you know

46:08.440 --> 46:12.240
what this is stupid I want to put metal together like I think that's I think a

46:12.240 --> 46:15.280
thing that a lot of creative people I don't know I think part of it is just

46:15.280 --> 46:21.080
like humans are designed to be happy like in the middle of something but then

46:21.080 --> 46:24.320
when they like feel like they get what they're achieving or they kind of get

46:24.320 --> 46:27.320
some taste of it they're like actually this sucked and I think it's but I

46:27.320 --> 46:32.960
haven't even gotten that far you got any pieces of it bird box bird box I was

46:32.960 --> 46:36.560

46:58.600 --> 47:04.640
everyone in the house and that's the movie crawl it's an episode of American

47:04.640 --> 47:09.040
dad it's also the movie bait sure earlier but it's by the person that did

47:09.040 --> 47:15.080
that Daniel Randcliffe Daniel Radcliffe is horns right he sure is same

47:15.080 --> 47:19.760
director see that horns movie no Daniel Radcliffe like wakes up and he's like I

47:19.760 --> 47:28.320
got horns and it's like mystical realism and I was like okay awake me when

47:28.320 --> 47:33.720
you're Star Wars bro that's me with every movie I'm like whoa where's the

47:33.720 --> 47:40.880
lightsabers no you're not I don't like I don't like mystical realism unless it's

47:40.880 --> 47:50.000
so mystical it's fantasy it like tracks I don't like it when people are just like

47:50.000 --> 47:55.440
there's a fish on my toe and then someone else is like boomerang I'm like

47:55.440 --> 48:00.120
okay what's that those movies are challenging me yeah those are crazy

48:00.120 --> 48:12.240
movies yeah should we should we get Jeff out when's the last time you saw the

48:12.240 --> 48:20.280
movie orca never a little a little attempt to cash it in the jaws I've

48:20.280 --> 48:24.440
seen a lot of jaws ripoff there were killer whales always in the ocean since

48:24.440 --> 48:32.320
the beginning of time really and so jaws came out to I think positive

48:32.320 --> 48:39.360
reception and people were in a flurry they were like I will I would also like

48:39.360 --> 48:43.520
to make a movie about a thing under the sea that eats people and they're like oh

48:43.520 --> 48:47.480
my god there's these things called killer whales we should make a movie about

48:47.480 --> 48:54.080
them orca orca I was called orca like probably 1978 wasn't wasn't Quinn

48:54.080 --> 48:59.520
ship called the orca yes there's a connection well because orcas I think

48:59.520 --> 49:03.200
if they see a shark they'll fucking annihilate it I don't know if orcas ever

49:03.200 --> 49:08.720
do see sharks though where do orcas live don't they live in like Pennsylvania

49:09.840 --> 49:18.800
that bagel boss guy he's a charlatan he was pretty angry pretty pissed off that's

49:18.800 --> 49:24.280
what he thought would make the video go viral you're just playing into his hands

49:24.280 --> 49:28.960
yeah but that's okay right isn't it like well I'll tell you when I saw it

49:28.960 --> 49:33.080
scrolling through my feed being shared by multiple people I was like I don't

49:33.080 --> 49:37.200
like the smell of this I ain't watching and someone's like bagel boss is a fake

49:37.200 --> 49:42.920
he's a phony and I'm like I knew it I smelled the right smell he's a fake you

49:42.920 --> 49:49.160
mean wait so that was stage yeah that's what I was trying behind the counter no

49:49.160 --> 49:53.360
no they know that's what sucks about it he's just like I'm gonna act crazy and

49:53.360 --> 49:57.120
get online oh do you think he had a friend tackle him I'm fair I don't know

49:57.120 --> 50:00.360
about that I mean it depends on where you just so if you define fake is just like

50:00.360 --> 50:03.760
he goes he purposely was being belligerent knowing that something would

50:03.760 --> 50:07.460
happen that he's consistently but that's not fake that's going into a public

50:07.460 --> 50:12.680
space and being a dickhead which yeah to be online yeah yeah yeah which which which

50:12.680 --> 50:16.160
is why I was worried only for five seconds he was gonna kill himself and

50:16.160 --> 50:20.720
then I found out he's a person who this is the shit that he rolls around in and

50:20.720 --> 50:26.000
I was like like one one other person's not gonna commit suicide because of like

50:26.000 --> 50:30.320
fucking internet infamy okay he wanted it he wanted it and if the audience wants

50:30.320 --> 50:33.880
it and he wants it then it's kind of like almost but they want it because it's

50:33.880 --> 50:40.160
real they how real do they really want it to be though when they're like if they

50:40.160 --> 50:43.440
really would they want to be responsible for him blowing his brains out I want to

50:43.440 --> 50:47.200
be responsible for I'd take pride in that I'd hang that on my wall oh come on

50:47.200 --> 50:54.160
Internet asshole blows his brain hang the bagel boss I want a lot of people to

50:54.160 --> 51:00.680
tell you you would hang the bagel boss video on the wall and be proud of it

51:00.680 --> 51:04.200
no first of all yes

51:04.400 --> 51:14.320
first of all yes no be like an award for most bagel bosses killed you know we

51:14.320 --> 51:18.600
never finished the you never got a chance to explain what the fuck happened

51:18.600 --> 51:23.400
with the bees is as uneventful as it was like I like we introduced the segment

51:23.400 --> 51:28.360
Spencer explains what happened with the bees and oh I didn't notice that did

51:28.360 --> 51:32.520
that happen did I not I thought I told the whole story yeah well what what what

51:32.520 --> 51:36.640
I I want the mundane story because I've never witnessed bees being like

51:36.640 --> 51:40.480
excavated from a wall before what happened all right so the guy who did

51:40.480 --> 51:43.640
the estimate he was like we're gonna have to open the wall close the wall we

51:43.640 --> 51:48.040
were working construction it'll be bang bang boom the guy comes out he's like

51:48.040 --> 51:52.880
oh this is a retaining wall who gave you this estimate and I was like I don't know

51:52.880 --> 51:56.640
he was like young some young he was like some young guy like Anthony and I'm like

51:56.640 --> 52:00.960
I don't know sure and he was like yeah this is a retaining wall you don't want

52:00.960 --> 52:04.320
to damage in it retaining wall you know mess with a structural integrity we can

52:04.320 --> 52:09.000
repair it but it's never gonna be the same kind of wall I'm like well there's

52:09.000 --> 52:15.440
still bees and the and the bees are now being used as an excuse by the fifth in

52:15.440 --> 52:21.840
a series of children's crusades to like make my stereo work yeah we thought it

52:21.840 --> 52:26.560
was yeah and now I've moved out of the house and probably investing in apple

52:26.560 --> 52:30.840
home pods and never gonna look back but at least all those children died people

52:30.840 --> 52:34.920
are just gonna yeah so what did they all right so what did they do they just

52:34.920 --> 52:39.880
walked away from the retaining wall he was like he was like okay so he looked

52:39.880 --> 52:43.720
at it and thought about it a bit he was like okay so well what I'm gonna do is

52:43.720 --> 52:47.720
I'm gonna dig down because the retaining wall is up against a hill and so there's

52:47.720 --> 52:51.160
a bunch of dirt so you can stand in front of the wall and shovel down with the

52:51.160 --> 52:54.960
shovel and I was like okay that sounds great he was like do you got a shovel

52:54.960 --> 53:00.640
and I'm like I could get a shovel so he's standing up up where the coyotes go

53:00.640 --> 53:06.120
no no he's up there no no so you have this it's the patio wall against which is

53:06.120 --> 53:12.520
like the the barbecue and stuff you know that lower wall oh that wall yeah

53:12.520 --> 53:17.160
that's the one the bees are all up on it's a little short wall yeah oh okay so

53:17.160 --> 53:20.760
he's like standing over you know chest high and kind of just hacking at it with

53:20.760 --> 53:25.720
the garden trowel that I found so he's using the garden trowel he digs it must

53:25.720 --> 53:29.320
have been like five feet I don't know like he did it very fast but I was like

53:29.320 --> 53:33.520
I feel like you're gonna need a bigger shovel or something he did not need a

53:33.520 --> 53:36.640
bigger shovel he didn't need buckets he just kind of tossed the dirt backwards

53:36.640 --> 53:42.680
not backwards behind him like up up the hill and he eventually got he got down

53:42.680 --> 53:49.920
there enough and then he turns on the bee vacuum there's a bee vacuum oh and

53:49.920 --> 53:55.400
he's just vacuuming bees for like an hour I want to say like an hour and a half

53:55.400 --> 54:01.120
and the bee vacuum looks very much like a shop vac that's just that's just it

54:01.120 --> 54:06.960
probably is it probably well if it isn't I would be like get a shop back yeah but

54:06.960 --> 54:11.680
it's attached to one of these bee boxes like it's a big you know maybe quadruple

54:11.680 --> 54:16.280
shoebox size wooden box and I'm like well how do you you know how do you take the

54:16.280 --> 54:20.000
lid off that thing there's just bees all over the place but I you know I'm not

54:20.000 --> 54:25.080
asking questions you just take that box and sell it to like almond farmers who

54:25.080 --> 54:29.760
are like not paying top price for like here's your bee colony you wanted to

54:29.760 --> 54:32.880
pollinate your fucking orchard that's like little do they know they're like

54:32.880 --> 54:37.880
these embattled confused traumatized yeah with no queen who are just like

54:37.880 --> 54:41.320
angry at the world I asked him what he did with the bees and he said he puts it

54:41.320 --> 54:47.960
in a cardboard box and sends it to an enemy you made a new friend yeah yeah

54:47.960 --> 54:53.000
we were great I was like you know this bagel box guy how did you how did he say

54:53.000 --> 54:57.760
that last part did he like give you like a little wink at the end or go well he

54:57.760 --> 55:02.200
nudged me in the ribs with his knee with his elbow did you really know none of

55:02.200 --> 55:07.680
this I there doesn't even a bee guy I just hit it with a pose no okay so he

55:07.680 --> 55:12.640
doesn't he doesn't send the bee box to his enemies okay he doesn't know he

55:12.640 --> 55:16.240
doesn't he didn't say that that was an embellishment no I thought that might be

55:16.240 --> 55:20.080
a funny thing to say it might also might be true that it's a funny thing that he

55:20.080 --> 55:23.120
would say because he's in that business that would have been funnier if he

55:23.120 --> 55:26.520
actually said it yeah right but he's earnest no he's just a he's just a

55:26.520 --> 55:30.200
consummate professional this guy okay he had a cool-looking apiarist outfit you

55:30.200 --> 55:34.600
know in Minecraft you can make one but it takes a fucking eight what an apiarist

55:34.600 --> 55:42.360
is a bee man yeah what what say it's lower and louder apiarist api ar ist

55:42.360 --> 55:49.440
apiarist be is nowhere in now apiary is a bee thing apiary is like a bee house

55:49.440 --> 55:57.040
or something but it's ape don't don't I'm trying I know but just so I can be

55:57.040 --> 56:04.240
as smart as you what if I'm smart I'll be what's the name of a so like a bug

56:04.240 --> 56:10.320
scientist is like an entomologist no it's it's not though but it's like

56:10.320 --> 56:14.040
entomology has nothing to do with bug or insect or anything it's just a word

56:14.040 --> 56:19.600
that's is that means the thing yeah it's just language it's all due to etymology

56:19.600 --> 56:24.480
which has nothing to do with insects yeah all right come on so he vacuums up

56:24.480 --> 56:32.040
just like will you stop for a second your quest for fucking truth about every

56:32.040 --> 56:40.080
word I just there's just words and yeah yeah I hope you do but there's bees he

56:40.080 --> 56:45.120
vacuumed them up put them in his bee box he takes off the top of this bee vacuum

56:45.120 --> 56:48.760
there's a little screen down there the bees can't come out I don't know how

56:48.760 --> 56:53.280
that happens because the bee vacuum was on top of that screen huh so maybe the

56:53.280 --> 56:56.960
screen slides in through some but then like the bee could get out from there I

56:56.960 --> 57:00.720
don't know I didn't question it he had the bees in a box there's something like

57:00.720 --> 57:05.120
three four hundred bees there is still about sixteen twenty bees maybe forty

57:05.120 --> 57:08.400
bees kind of flying around buzzing around the outside he got all the honey

57:08.400 --> 57:13.200
comb up out of there and I think he put it in a trash bag I know it would have

57:13.200 --> 57:17.120
been delicious you a little taste he didn't even hand it off to a bear did

57:17.120 --> 57:21.760
he mention the queen he did not I did not ask about the queen still in there

57:21.760 --> 57:25.120
no presumably the queen was taken with it because he got the queen would have

57:25.120 --> 57:33.240
been you know say sick put what do you call it but sacrosanct sacrosanct it

57:33.240 --> 57:36.880
would have been stationed up in the honey comb which he removed and I don't

57:36.880 --> 57:41.480
know if you kill the queen I think you don't kill the queen if you can avoid

57:41.480 --> 57:46.840
it but yeah I think you just maybe just vacuumed it up it's like God it's like

57:46.840 --> 57:51.240
very thick in the host yeah you expected me at the end he goes oh that was the

57:51.240 --> 57:58.120
queen yeah exactly just splits onto I guess professional apiarists like

57:58.120 --> 58:02.640
people that cultivate bees what they'll do is they you could just smoke the bees

58:02.640 --> 58:09.800
which I make some more man number one why does why does spraying smoke all

58:09.800 --> 58:16.360
over bees calm them down what a dumb design I think they can't see and they

58:16.360 --> 58:21.280
just kind of like that should be a pretty fundamental thing for all life is like oh

58:21.280 --> 58:27.520
there's smoke I should get like upset about let me tell you this if you're

58:27.520 --> 58:32.920
driving and there's a fog do you drive faster you drive more calmly no I drive

58:32.920 --> 58:40.160
slower okay but I think I think it's much more more okay all right look oh be

58:40.160 --> 58:47.280
high it's not working very well for bees there it's it is an exploitable defect

58:47.280 --> 58:51.320
in their fucking consciousness that they react to smoke that way I think it's

58:51.320 --> 58:55.520
more like when you park in your garage and you leave your window open and the

58:55.520 --> 59:00.120
engine running and then you fall asleep and then you die I think it's more like

59:00.120 --> 59:03.400
that oh you think they're getting a high off the smoke well not high so much is

59:03.400 --> 59:07.160
suffocating right they're not they're not taking in as much right and I think

59:07.160 --> 59:11.880
they yeah they don't they because I think some of them get a little I don't

59:11.880 --> 59:15.080
think so I don't think it's enough to kill poisoning them but it was roofing

59:15.080 --> 59:18.560
them yeah I don't know that they hack and cough and scream running out of the

59:18.560 --> 59:21.280
building you know but some of them do I think some of them get a lot more pissed

59:21.280 --> 59:24.840
off when when the smoke is happening I don't know and the whole thing is he's

59:24.840 --> 59:28.120
in a fucking outfit anyway what does it matter if the bees are pissed or not

59:28.120 --> 59:32.360
pissed they're not gonna do anything he's like impenetrable yeah if people that

59:32.360 --> 59:35.840
made the people that deal with bees all the time to make honey or whatever the

59:35.840 --> 59:39.040
fuck they're doing they they they're in the busy you know you just get queens

59:39.040 --> 59:44.720
through the mail and then like you queens have a certain lifespan five seven

59:44.720 --> 59:51.040
years or something it's like your bee colony needs to be a little less sluggish

59:51.040 --> 59:54.680
than that they'll get high on the hog at the end of Queen Victoria's like rain

59:54.680 --> 01:00:00.760
and like you you the they they'll just pull out the queen put a new queen in

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:05.840
there and the bees will be like okay cool yeah I guess we're making honey for her

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.480
now exactly like what an exploitable bunch of numerons you know they use

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.400
I mean they're flying insects that have stingers on their bodies they have no

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:19.640
idea how close they are to being like so like they could they could have taken

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:24.480
over like that oh yeah and then I mean we're I'm terrified of them and then and

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.280
it's extra terrifying when you learn that they're like super intelligent they

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.440
have their own alphabet and they like make these hexagonal fucking thing like

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.400
Jesus Christ this that's scary shit they could have like like they just need to

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.240
be a little more evil and they could they would really have us over a barrel

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.640
and stellar bees they're making like chapstick for us they're hanging out

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.760
and they're on the endangered list along with every other fucking thing yeah

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:59.760
big dummies way to go your big dumb shit bees yeah yeah you're on the list

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:06.920
along with your dopey gorillas your dumb fucked your afts stupid ants you

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:14.640
fucking foxes stupid ass clover eating deer I have fucking marmots whatever

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:21.240
that is mammoths sets I'm making shit up now it's all stupid you know you

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:29.080
should have done five fingers and a big-ass brain what yeah like what up the

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:36.360
what what what what what figures five fingers up a point up their ass no

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:42.800
what why would you add up the butt to what me just saying what what is that

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.000
painful if I told you how the sixth sense and would you be like what he see

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.360
that he's dead up the ass I like why would you just add up you said five

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:57.640
fingers and well yeah why and why did you take it there I'm not kink shaming you

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:02.480
but what the fuck dude I'm like making a really salient point I'm just trying to

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:09.520
fill time look none of us want to be here I love it anyway the bees yeah so

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.800
I'm gonna hear the end of that story he sprays the bees here he sprays the

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.360
thing with a like anti-bee pheromone or something he says the bees hate this

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:22.720
they hate this and then he covers it back up and then he takes the bee box

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.200
down to his car but there's bees outside of the bee box kind of hovering

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.720
around they're like where's all the bees going you know he puts it into his car

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.880
and there's a couple bees that are like trying to get into his car and I'm like

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:37.480
oh man do bees ever get out in your car and he's like yeah one or two and I'm

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.760
like man that's nuts he's like that's fine it's like that's an occupational

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.120
hazardous loose bees in the car and he's just come to terms with it he must

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.400
have been stung a million times and he's just like yeah whatever I asked him

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.920
about that he said like not not too many times he said like I can remember the

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:57.720
last time I stung I got stung well then why is he so chill about a bee in your

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:02.080
car is our definition of an emergency yeah what right does he have to be

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.280
did he say when was the last time he got like who was president like when he

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:14.680
got stung yeah who Obama Obama he got stung when Obama was president yeah first

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:19.200
or second term I don't know I didn't ask which term I mean are there is there

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:25.280
any end to that guy's fuck ups as a president I know thanks Obama but top of

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.040
everything else he got that guy stung and then he said he takes him to his

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.080
house he has like a property that has where you think he just he's just he's

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:41.160
like a hoarder of bees he just he puts the bees in like a bee apartment they

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.440
love it they're having new friends oh yeah no that's terrible all these bees

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:50.240
that end up in my swimming pool I keep like scooping him out and they're just

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.880
like why do they go in the water they're thirsty I someone told me and I'm like

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.760
that's silly I like what they're bees they could get water anywhere there's

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.840
dew drops I don't think living like a that's proof that bees can't tell

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.280
stories yeah I was like they wiggle on the pool and then I'll like let them out

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.120
I'll put them on a pair I'll take a pair of swim trunks or something I'll go

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:15.000
like scoop I'll put them on the edge of the pool I'll go like there you go you

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.680
did it you know you're supposedly like 70% of the food web or something I hope

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:27.760
you do well and then the bees like flying and he's like he gets the he works

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.480
it all out and second damn can't believe I fell into a giant vat of chlorinated

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:38.560
fucking like water he walks right back with plops on the pool these fucking

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.280
things I'm like I did what I did three rounds with one of them and then I

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:47.920
fucking smushed it I was like oh damn you can't I told him I said this is God

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:53.560
talking to you you have done this twice like I cannot allow you to keep walking

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:58.840
into my pool you are self-destructive and I am no stranger to that maybe the

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:05.080
chlorine made him he loves it maybe maybe maybe he's up maybe he's right

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.360
priorities he's like dude in Hollywood I'm in a pool like what are you trying

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:17.880
to do man this is where I wanted to go out you're not in Hollywood damn you

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.200
know they used to call him king bees because they couldn't fathom queen or

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:26.880
you know a woman being in charge all those bees really yeah I think it was

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.240
Aristotle who's like famous the Roland Emmerich Godzilla movie where they were

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:38.400
like where Godzilla like gave birth to a bunch of baby Godzilla's and and they

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:44.840
said oh this male must give birth to and it's like just you just say Godzilla's

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.760
a girl you god damn it why why couldn't Godzilla be well because then YouTube

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:57.560
would have fucking I'm sorry I refuse to review this movie they didn't mind

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:04.400
Godzilla into a prancing ballerina but they had they said well we this one's

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:10.360
not a girl yeah it was like a story point where they kept like saying well

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:15.320
it's strange because usually the male does doesn't give birth it's usually the

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:23.120
the other whoa I mean like right in the name did you do you remember when we

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:31.280
met with those guys yes when they wanted to do Godzilla to yeah I'm older than

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:37.520
both of them now we met with those guys yeah we got that was that was another

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.440
career non-changer because we pissed them off like I don't think they pissed them

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:47.000
off but I think I think nobody wanted no version of a sequel no well they good

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.520
but they we could have come out of that meeting with those guys going like this

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.800
is Harmon and Schrab guys like they're cool like but we insulted them on accident

01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:02.000
oh how did you remember how because we we said we were we were movie was a piece

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
we were we were talking about the giant robot movie that we were writing at the

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.720
time and we were like like we were like yeah no it's gonna it's not not not like

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.400
your movie it's gonna be like just like old-school like guys in suits and then

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:21.320
they're there and Roland Emmerich was like I remember him as smoking with his

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.080
like like holding a cigarette like this but I don't know if he was actually

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.560
doing it he's so German that I was like just remember him like that's like what

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:33.640
if you took put a dog's head on a Jews body the didn't say that he didn't say

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:40.640
that he didn't know he did not say that he said Jewish he said Jewish he was very

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.040
tasteful about it the the no but it just picture I'm sure he wasn't smoking cuz

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.160
it was like we were in the world well it was his I mean he owned fucking he was

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:55.520
Columbia where it was like it was like like it anyways but yeah he and that

01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.520
because remember they kind of blanched when we said we mentioned guys in suits

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:06.440
and then they said they said like God's Dean Devlin said Godzilla was a guy in a

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:11.880
suit like they're Godzilla and you said yeah motion control suit and we kind of

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:17.320
like we were just sort of like why are we bullying them but we didn't mean to but

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.480
I just think I don't think we hit it off came out of the gate saying well what we

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.600
wanted to do is take something really dumb and yeah cool that was like that

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.800
was ever excited he said like you watch those old Godzilla movies and it's so

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.480
cheesy we just want to make it less cheesy and you you know you wanted to

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:36.280
murder him yeah I would fucking kick him in but you don't regret that right no not

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:40.600
at all great so like like so that's a good example of like like so you're

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.160
going through some woes right now like what's the real voice the voice inside

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.200
your head don't you think that's thematically connected where it's like

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:50.160
you know you're like when am I gonna get a break like wait or like what you know

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.760
it's like you don't want to be on the wrong side of your own personal history

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.920
you're you're you're a creative guy that has answers to a higher calling like the

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:02.960
reason for your current woes are precisely because you give too much of a

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.360
fuck not too much like pejoratively speaking like you you give too much of a

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:13.320
fuck for them in like it's problematic for them that you give so much of a fuck

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.280
that you're like don't you why do you want your thing to be shitty and they're

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:20.120
like fuck you like kind of thing whatever like it happens to be a million I

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:27.360
mean like whatever like I at the end of your life you're gonna you're gonna be

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:33.800
like God thank God like like what's the alternative to that like it's called

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.800
selling out like I don't want to be like Tyler Durton about it where it's like

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:43.800
good I think there's a there's just as much joy to doing what people want you

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:50.040
to do but yeah you know you're cool everybody likes you like fucking fuck

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:58.120
off you didn't fuck off you guys know about counter transference yes okay

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:04.280
moving on now what is it what is counter transfer it's when a therapist is

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:11.040
is like projecting their own situation on to the client situation I think my

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:17.280
therapist is doing that a lot oh no this could be bad uh no unless he thinks

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.880
that I'd look a lot like him with a haircut and like he's thinking of a

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.600
time where he had super long hair and then he he got his hair cut and then

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.440
like someone give him a therapist degree or something it just but it could be in

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:33.840
that example that your therapist is like transferring like some kind of like

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.840
weird insecurity about their anything right whether it's physical or not but

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.000
there and then they're like why don't you just fucking get a haircut you know

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.400
that they're like how is that going by the way I haven't been he's had a thing

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:50.200
I've had a thing we've had some things no but when when he brought up the hair

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:55.880
cut for like the billionth time or whatever I was like I was like do you

01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:00.840
go out do you think that like if I went to another therapist they would say

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.600
stuff like this or do you think that's just you and he was like well there's

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:09.840
this thing called counter transference and I'm like okay what the fuck are you

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:17.880
out of your fucking mind our next guest this is gold over here you know the

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:24.480
closest thing I'll ever have to a son you're gonna have kids right look I'm

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:30.280
not gonna kids I can't even get up out of this chair I I don't want to cast a

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.640
value judgment I just thought that was an intention that was happening now I'm

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.360
like Cody makes the world go around if she wants kids there's gonna be kids but

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.760
like she's not sure right unless I get distracted by that I want my dog to live

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:48.440
forever or at least you can clone your dog clone your dog not the same thing it

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.080
will be I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to clone my dog clone your

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.360
dog before it dies and then they can be friends there's too many dogs out there

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:02.040
that need homes and I'd rather rather give another home but I do both I just

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:11.320
would rather that I die before you could I gotta range that let's talk I used to

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.600
tweet stuff like that and then Courtney Love would text somebody like you're

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:27.200
sounding like you don't alarm let the kids know that I like you that way that's

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:34.240
possible like happy people are boring it's a flavor it's like black licorice

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:43.040
it's yummy life is darkness it's it but it's fun it's like you get your health

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:48.040
and and God is a weirdo it's easy for you people listen to you

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:54.080
people listen to you yeah and it's not making me any happier you got to do a

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.960
podcast job haven't your own podcast yeah I don't have anything to say the

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:06.200
Schrabcast all I've done is rack up a bunch more stories like you have where

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:09.920
I'm like and it's my own doing because people listen to me what you mean is like

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:14.800
oh I don't get fired I I fuck up and I quit or whatever it's like that's the

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:23.760
only difference like it I it it's like I just do is like the more permission I

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.640
get to like tell people what to do the more I let them down you should be like

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:34.480
excited about like your dilemma why am I telling you how to feel I like like

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:40.920
you're living the dream little piece of shit I think that a lot of people myself

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:46.600
included think about their their life in terms of I'm too old for it to happen

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.720
like everyone thinks that you know what to happen to play cards against

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.280
humanity like what's what is our dream like I yeah I'll tell you swimming pool

01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:03.120
turns out to be pretty fun but all right so this transference thing the therapist

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:09.240
like I like this like you you you pull the real fucking what have I done no and

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:15.600
I was a fucking like that was a very dare I say like me move on a therapist like

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.880
that where you were like hey you think if I see another they would talk this much

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:24.960
shit like like like asking them questions about their profession and then

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.480
the guy was like forced to open the hood and go like oh well there's this thing

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.160
called transference I bet you fucked him up real good well yeah I mean that's the

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.440
thing is cuz like there was I was not making eye contact with him because I

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:40.520
don't because because he asked you to once he asked me to and also he just

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.680
doesn't look great I don't want to look at that yeah you want to hear his soul

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:48.200
cry yeah but I just mostly don't like that also I just don't want I want I

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.920
don't want to think about looking about like I want to think about what I'm

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.120
thinking about anyway but I have no problem looking at you while you're

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.160
saying this because you're not looking at me and I like looking at you because

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.000
you're great to look at especially because you're not looking at tell that to

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:08.280
any woman doctor fuck yeah dr. fuckface no it's true but so I and then I asked

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:12.160
him that I was like is that and then I was making the most direct eye contact

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:18.480
I was like I am gonna eat you right now and I'm sure he loved that that's what

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.720
he was wanting the whole time I had I had a threshold with my therapist once

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.920
where I was I told her I don't know how it came up in context but I was

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:33.320
explaining to her I told there's a story that I've told up here at least once if

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:38.560
not twice or more we just give it then the thing that I had a therapist who I

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.680
stopped seeing because she was crying while I was talking to her about my

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.760
childhood but it wasn't really talking about like cry worthy stuff but my

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.400
childhood was more like here's my favorite book or something and then she

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.000
was like crying and I was like why are you crying and she was like it's very

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.240
emotional stuff and I was like no it's not and then at the end of the session

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.840
she was like I feel really conflicted about this I'm really humiliated but

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:03.800
you called me out on the tears before I had some eye work done recently and my

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.720
eyes are watering and then my instinct when you asked me why my eyes were

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:14.200
watering was to lie and I was like I thought in my head like that's fine to

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.520
make that mistake and then to come clean about it it's and if you were my

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:26.960
mechanic it would be fine to lie about it and blame me or like but my therapist

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:30.920
I think it's kind of a day I just never went back and I'm sure she wasn't shocked

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:36.080
and I hope she never thought oh I shouldn't have been honest I hope she

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:40.360
got the the other message was I shouldn't have been dishonest right but

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:46.480
anyways but but the I was telling that story to my current therapist and my

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:51.040
current therapist kind of was like she basically was sort of like why are you

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:57.000
telling me this story and I was like I don't know because we were talking about

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.640
this one thing and she was like are you maybe letting me know that you're like a

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:08.800
power user like of therapy and like I shouldn't fuck around because and she

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:13.520
said she sort of had a way of expressing she was kind of like like she

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.200
didn't she didn't counter it wasn't like a she but she I get the message from her

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.720
that it was like because that would be a fucked up environment in which I would

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.920
have to work kind of and like she she humanized herself it was sort of like

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:31.200
like like she said what I would say maybe if I was a therapist and someone was

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:36.360
like well one therapist one time they fucked up but not cut him loose and that

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.120
I guess I would I would say to that patient I would go like well if what

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:43.560
you're saying to me is that this is a fucking minefield like I'm probably not

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:48.480
gonna get any quality work done like sweating and like worried that I'm gonna

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.480
cut the blue wire into the red wire and she kind of and it was it was a big

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.200
threshold for us like among many where I was like oh man she like I trusted her

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:03.720
more after that and I think the moral of that story is is both that yeah bad

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:09.560
therapists suck and should be cut loose and good therapists you know them when

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:13.400
you got them because I was able to tell that story to her and instead of her

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:20.000
being like what a shitty therapist holler at your girl she was like like it's

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.840
notable that you're telling me that story and like it was it was a pathway for

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.320
us to deepen our relationship and for her to be able to help me even more

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.600
because I was able to open even more gateways to her because she earned it

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:36.640
by reacting like a human being to that story and communicating her own

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.840
vulnerabilities and stuff and I and so not that you asked for advice or anything

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:46.080
and you you already know this but like yeah like you definitely have like the

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.920
green light to cut this piece of he's not a piece of shit he might be a

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:53.400
wonderful therapist he's yeah he's like not compatible with you the thing yeah

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.240
we were talking about that and he was like well you seem to have a lot of you

01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:02.620
know what do you call it like weight put on your looks or you feel like your

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:06.320
appearances messed up and it's like well I feel like that because when I'm at the

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.640
store I'm like looking at cereal and then like a kid runs by and then like a

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:16.800
mom clutches the kid close and glares at me as they walk off together like I was

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.920
gonna like just reach out and start like molesting that child or something not

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:26.640
even making eye contact and when you're the Van Halen of molestation and when

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.320
that happens to you enough times you're like wow people must really think I'm

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:36.440
like a living monster nobody thinks you're a living certainly the parents who

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:41.880
do that to me do they they're then that's their problem yeah no I agree that's

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:45.960
their problem it's just traumatizing you're brought you don't look like a

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:50.840
monster I do to these people come on at one time I was leaving Dan's house in

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:54.600
the middle of the night and just as things what yeah not in the middle of

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.120
night sorry it was like at a party or something it was a while back but I was

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.600
like leaving your house and I was getting on to the sidewalk and someone was

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.840
jogging by like right at the same time and it wasn't like I stepped out in front

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:11.280
of them I we kind of just kind of stepped out in roughly the same space and

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.560
she like screamed and I was like I'm I guess I'm just an ogre like that's I'm

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:21.680
like Frankenstein I think I think she probably you startled her I did with my

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.960
appearance but I mean having said weren't you terrified that she ran by I

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.400
mean like I was terrified that that's the effect I have on people and then I

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.960
was like yeah I know this all tracks I've walked out of that gate with and it's

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.460
like it's the physical there's no line of sight

01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:41.280
situation of it is like so every once in a while like boom somebody like runs by

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:47.400
or walks by with their dog I fucking freak I'm yelp yeah well but yeah but

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:51.360
what if those people because they were ugly or monstrous they would be so

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:57.360
wrong I was like there was a physical body like coming by me oh from the stool

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:04.520
asses fell asleep I Jesus Christ this couch isn't bad is Jeff still here I

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:09.600
think he left it doesn't I mean shoes that's a good point he can't really get

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:14.360
too far without that stuff he has his phone though

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:17.680
why don't we why don't we why don't we why don't we make a new friend we haven't

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:24.960
done that in a long time who's somebody that how do we what do we do we can't

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:31.440
just base it on who wants to be on stage those are horrible people but

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:34.640
inevitably that's what you're picking you know right it's not like if I say

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.280
who's allergic to clovers and someone who doesn't want to be on stage and is

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:42.600
richly allergic to clovers they're gonna not raise their hand right they're

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:48.600
gonna they're critical thinkers and now they have to be people who are willing

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:52.320
to raise their hand after being potentially called out as people who

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.120
want to be on stage so that's already gonna be like more fucked up people well

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.960
I think I well maybe I'm deluded about this but I think that me doing that kind

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:04.720
of actually eases the like like me calling attention to it like means that

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.560
if they raise their hand then it's like now they've thought about it and the

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.440
audience is like who's this piece of shit they can watch to be on stage it's

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:14.600
like I already talked about it like they're aware of the fury are you doing

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:19.200
any new music are you doing any music new music I hit like this thing I'm

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:24.920
trying to mic my car I got I got I got I got fucked up like neurological problems

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:30.200
man like I get into something that makes me happy and then I fucking like I

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.800
just like I'm like oh I gotta okay I get it I gotta make my car right like like

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:38.800
so that I can do little raps that we're making everyone happy and making me

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.160
happy and I'm like like somewhere in there I just like I just I ordered like a

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.960
million dollars worth of fucking shit that didn't work and then I was like I

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:50.720
don't know what it is with me I got my own I got I got fucked up shit in my

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:55.880
brain you know like that's gonna suck you know like that started I started

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:59.560
playing cookie collector that's when you know I'm really fucked up like I like

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:04.200

01:24:53.800 --> 01:25:00.160
the Jesus fucking Christ you're gonna knock over the Jeff golem this fucking

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:05.720
show I just every week I want to quit and then I give it one more chance and

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:10.200
then Schrab who are the guys I walk past on the sidewalk when I was coming in

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:17.440
with you guys here okay yeah you didn't take that the really like I I felt like

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.000
I accidentally offended you guys okay because I did a thing it was like kind

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.960
of like when I for the first time I met Seth Rogen it was like we were walking

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:32.400
on a on a on the on a lot of some kind and there was someone I was with that

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:39.400
like knew Seth Rogen and he was like hey Seth it's me so-and-so or whatever and

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:44.320
and Seth Rogen had the it was like had this like Seth Rogen chuckle but I was

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.160
like well yeah I knew you when I saw you guys walking toward me I was like well

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.880
these guys are probably fans of mine so like I like it was like and it was kind

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.920
of an endearing thing and it was kind of like in the moment I was sort of like

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.520
because I saw you guys coming and then you were like smirking at me because

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:02.320
you were walking past me and then I had a moment to think about it and then you

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.680
guys were like we're coming to see your show and I blurted something like yeah

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:15.280
well you look like it or something it was a and I'm I really didn't I'm not

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:23.320
good at talking welcome Jack okay a researcher you have to do science yeah

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:29.160
I got in it after college I was I studied organic chemistry in college right

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:33.200
I was working as an organic chemist in a research lab and then I got hired and

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:46.280
yeah that's cool so like all right so what do you know about this maybe you

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:51.600
should touch it that's an either of us want that no no no just like give it a

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.960
little twiddle just so you can let it I'll touch it if you want me to touch it

01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:04.680
I'm not concerned about it or worried about I think you should touch it right

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:08.880
it's entertaining to the people no it's doesn't that's not important it's a

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:15.080
dead what okay they have a normal life cycle they grow and they fall off

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:21.040
generally what are they on a cellular level they're just epithelial fish you

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.800
but like in terms of like is it is it related to cancer like is it a phenomenon

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:30.600
like cancer but it's just like not yeah so they're called like a nevis which is

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:36.520
like a form for skin lesion and which is just another word for a mole or

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.760
something like that they're not technically a how come some cells can go

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.600
crazy and start just making more of themselves and you get like the

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:49.320
a blemish like a mole or a skin tag or and like how come how come how come

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:53.280
sometimes that's just like a thing that's contained and just like falls off or

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:59.880
isn't isn't worrisome and then what what why is that why isn't it a zero-sum

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.200
game if a cell has lost its mind and is just making more of itself like why why

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.640
do some of them just stop and make a mole and some of them become a tumor that

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.200
kills you so it turns out that like mutations are required to make cancer

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.800
and mutations happen all the time they happen every time your skin cells get

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:25.280
hit with sunlight they happen every time you interact with toxic chemicals and a

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.480
lot of those mutations are harmless and in fact it takes sometimes hundreds of

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:35.760
mutations or or thousands of mutations to make something into a cancer and what

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:40.040
you almost sound like you're saying that the things that that are benign that

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:44.600
grow on the surface of our skin that those aren't the result of mutations they

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:50.600
can definitely be the result of mutations there's a genetic component to

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:56.600
things that grow on your skin Nevi as they're called or moles or skin tags and

01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:02.280
the genetic component so some people especially white people have up to

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:08.600
hundreds of moles on their body and some people don't have very many at all

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:17.000
I'm also one of those people the most harmless form of white supremacy I've

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.920
ever heard I never I never knew I could get behind any form of white

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:33.160
supremacy until a guy like whoo to skin tags being prevalent yeah oh wow I mean

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:38.200
gosh yeah I feel like like thank you but you're like a dream like wait I want

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:41.200
to plug your album or something I mean you're like you're you're you're being

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:46.880
so like like fucking straightforward so I call you're so anti-Schrab do you see

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:54.160
Chernobyl I haven't seen Chernobyl oh is it a nightmare for you yeah yeah I know

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:58.600
exactly what's happening to that guy's face yeah yeah you should watch Chernobyl

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:04.000
it's really it's really people are really liking it oh they're thinking it's

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:11.280
great you should watch Chernobyl did do you have already Chernobyl do you have

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:18.200
Chernobyl at home do you have it at home I grew up with Chernobyl right right

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:23.680
right it happened to all of us did it what kind of a life span did it happen

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:26.480
did it fall off

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.400
long okay so important question ignore me so that so when one of these things is

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:38.640
growing on our eyelids or arms dangling off and like so what about this like

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:42.800
science that I've had programmed into me it was like I'm not supposed to do

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:46.320
anything to this I've heard people tell anecdotes about I went to my general

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:51.480
doctor he brought out a scalpel and sliced it right off after I worried about

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:55.600
it for six months he's like who gives a shit and then other people go don't touch

01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:01.320
it don't fuck with it like if you pull it off it'll it's like it becomes cancer

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:07.500
is there any truth or reasoning vast majority will not become cancer is there

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:13.720
any reason why people would think that there's I mean with every so one part

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:18.360
of a possible life cycle of an Evis is to accumulate enough mutations to become

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:25.400
cancer and whether you and so maybe pulling it off is simply encouraging

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:30.720
it to grow more like pruning a tree in which case if it was gonna eventually

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:35.320
become cancer you're just giving it a kind of a boost so the worry with cancer

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:39.000
isn't so much that it's gonna grow it's that it's gonna metastasize it's gonna

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.520
spread your other tissues and it's gonna cause them to shut down especially your

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:46.080
major organs wait what's the say that again cuz that's the definition of a

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:51.480
really important cancer so metastasize means it say that again yeah so the the

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:55.960
the worry with cancer is that it's going to become metastatic it's gonna be able

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:59.600
to move through things like your bloodstream or your lymph into other

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:04.520
tissues not that well so so cancer can't just kill you by just like like I'm a

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.760
little piece of bone that decided it's not a bone I'm gonna grow into a big

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:12.080
ball of bone the problem is that it actually spreads to like lymph nodes and

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.640
whatever I want to kind of add the disclaimer that I'm answer this question

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:20.920
to the best of my ability but I'm also not a doctor I'm just you also said you

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:24.360
also said excuse me then you also said you weren't a good person explain

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:30.800
yourself I guess I'm on stage so in some in some way yeah I wanted to be here

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:33.440
and I don't know that I guess that doesn't make me a good person or a bad

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:40.000
person I mean wow yeah it's a casted paradox you're it's a Taoist principle

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.560
like like if you thought you were a good person you'd be a shitty person you

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.680
gotta think you're a bad person that's your only recourse to being a good

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:55.000
person yeah yeah yeah yeah and I went shut yeah are there some of the people

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.200
who are watching through subscription we're seeing your face are probably

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:03.640
wondering like dermatology research are you like cheating like do you like there

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:07.280
there are stringents at the office and things like because you have very nice

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:13.520
skin and I'm not hitting on you but like you're I thank you I actually it's one

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:17.560
thing I'm self-conscious about is my skin which is weird maybe to hear you

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:22.760
say that what are you worried about I don't know I I mean you're very handsome

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:31.640
stop it stop it stop it everyone under 40 by the way is just wonderful looking

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:38.160
to me now I just look and I see everyone is like non piles of bones and I go

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:53.600
hubba hubba to answer your original question what is what's your favorite

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:59.840
kind of let him answer let me I want to know what let him answer son let him

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:06.080
answer sunburns you couldn't come into the laboratory with a sunburn that would

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:10.040
be you would yeah my boss would tear my head off if I came in with a sunburn oh

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.640
like well okay well tell me a little bit about that because I'm very like very

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:21.760
very cockazoid like guy that just got a pool and like I'm I got a lot of British

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:29.600
DNA and I'm like I turned pink fast I peel fast like I like what I don't

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:34.160
understand sunscreen I don't understand I don't even know what to ask you I wish

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.240
you could just tell me something to make me not worry because I feel like I people

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:41.400
are always telling me put on sunscreen definitely tell you something to make you

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:47.360
not worry okay what I don't know that'd be true you should definitely worry oh

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:56.440
yeah I like that honestly you're saying I could lie to you yeah but you all right

01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.920
don't I don't want you to I think the coolest thing about sun tanning actually

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:06.960
is that is my favorite fact about skin really is that sunlight yeah I guess I'm

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:13.360
a nerd sunlight in order to tan you actually have to damage the DNA tanning

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:18.000
is a direct response to like getting DNA damage sunlight actually comes in and

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.400
it mutates or destroys parts of your DNA and then your cells respond by wow

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.760
producing pigment and they produce these little shields like in your skin

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:32.880
melanoma melanin melanin actually produces a little shield like if you look

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.120
at a skin cell under a microscope it'll be there'll be like a little shield of

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:42.120
melanin over the nucleus right where the DNA is so melanin is what it's like I

01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:47.200
think you just told me but it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:51.440
coating around a cell membrane it's a pigment so it's like a small molecule as

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:58.560
opposed to like protein or something is it itself it's not it's I'm trying to

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.600
picture like like remember in high school they showed us like a cross section of

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:06.400
skin and it's like okay there's like all these layers so like is melanin like a

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:10.760
chemical that exists somewhere in one of those layers that like oh man this is a

01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:18.160
lot gonna be a lot of science so melanin is produced in the melanocytes is a

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.920
special type of cell specifically for producing melanin and totally a special

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:31.200
cell yeah it's in the basal layer of the skin so the skin has like a lot of other

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.960
types of cells in it one of them is the melanocytes they have these like

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:41.040
special little tendrils that are like pumping out melanin pumping out melanin

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:44.480
and they actually like ship it off to all your other cells and give it to the

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:48.160
cells so that the cells can protect themselves and the cells coat themselves

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.400
in it no they just produce like a protective shield over the nucleus just

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:57.960
the nucleus nucleus oh wow yeah which is pretty cool that's my favorite that is

01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:06.320
cool I thought so god damn I love fucking biology I yeah and so and so and so

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:12.400
our emphasis on like pigmentation with the as we you know eight billion of us

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.280
are all like mad at each other we're looking at each other on Facebook and

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:18.280
we're like recognizing each other as being from different parts of the world

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:22.160
and things like all of it really comes down to like these shades and things and

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:28.280
so the melanin is like a so there's like if you're if your genetic heritage

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:32.440
comes from a part where there's this being beaten by the Sun then then those

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:48.640
melanites I'm going to make you olive complexion they're just they're just

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:52.600
pumping out different degrees of sunscreen like which probably comes at a

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:58.240
metabolic cost right that's correct actually both those things yeah and so

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:05.800
and so white white people are at much higher risk of skin cancer than people

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:10.240
that have like more melanin like black I guess it's just natural suns that it's

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:16.560
put like because your nucleus is exposed to the Sun yes although anyone can get

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:20.440
skin cancer right right right not to say yeah I'm not telling anyone to go

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:29.120
what about Brad say again what about Brad just a friend of yours that yeah can

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.080
he get skin cancer how does he ever go in the Sun

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:39.120
well yeah he's Brad oh I kind of wondering yeah like Brad it's like

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:44.360
these mutants like so like this the thing that's hanging off of my arm which

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:48.680
may or may not fall off it'll pick its own time but it's it's so it's an

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.360
expression of my genetic code as a person that's descended from East

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.360
Europeans and British people and it's like it's a part of my skin that's

01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:00.520
going like oh this is a good place for like a random fucking quato like just

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:04.600
like blossom off and it's like it even though it's not mutation based it is

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:08.120
long-term mutation based in the sense that parents are shuffling their genes

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:12.280
every time they make a baby and then we're all carrying over these like weird

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.280
random experiments in our DNA and some of those experiments will say like this

01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:18.560
person should have this color eyes or this person should have like this

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:23.560
dorsal fin or gills or something that like might come in handy but like my DNA

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:28.120
is includes all this like static that's like and by the way have a little like

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:35.120
porcupine come off of his arm when he's 46 and like it it's it has in its own way

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:39.800
it's a function it's an it would only have a function if it was in the sense

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:47.280
of emergence if over time wouldn't it ultimately it could lead to if there was

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:53.120
a chance that having that thing on my arm led to my DNA like if everyone

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:57.960
found that incredibly hot and and not having a thing dangling off your arm

01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:02.880
was like gross get him away from me and then and then wouldn't with this past

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:12.560
to my children like growing it on the same spot on my arm no okay yeah you're

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.320
asking basically is there a selection pressure an evolutionary selection

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:21.840
pressure on things like skin tags exactly what I'm also asking like to the

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:27.160
extent that it's a it's a it's a it's a function of my DNA is it is it is it

01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:33.720
yes hereditary but it's hereditary to have them but location wise your there's

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:38.640
probably predisposed places on people's bodies where they're more likely to

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:43.360
occur just like if your mom and dad both have one on their eyelid when they're

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:48.400
25 and both of them grow and fall off but and then they have a kid together is

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:53.560
that kid more likely to have a skin tag on their eyelid or just more likely to

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:57.440
have skin tags I'm definitely not qualified to answer that question but

01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:02.240
doubtful all right well Jesus Christ what a fucking podcast well if you're so

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:08.000
smart you tell us about the Jewish golem what do you know about the Jewish

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:18.560
golem what kind of magic I can probably confirm that it's not skin tag magic

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.640
right and our skin related magic thank you do you live here in LA are you

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.080

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:55.480
older sister a kid sister and then I was like I don't even know how old you are

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.240

01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:07.120
how old everyone is 28 so she your kid sister no she's older than I am she's

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:29.560
from originally I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area okay not that much of

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:36.760
a track I heard a upe we got a upe and are you you you sound like you

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:41.720
cycled into this dermatological research part of your organic chemistry like

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:48.680
are you do you have do you have dreams that overflow that cup you like you you

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.600
ended up there are you happy there or is there no actually I feel like I'm kind

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.040
of in Schrab position where I'm kind of like what the fuck I don't know what the

01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:01.280
fuck you've hit a crossroads you're like what are you you're fucking lucky man so

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:06.880
you're basically 28 year old dude with flawless skin are you happy now you're

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:15.400
in the same fucking boat so stop fucking doing what we used to call bitchin

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:27.760
before the me too movement okay well don't repeat it have you been me too not

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:36.440
no it's it's like a chemical peel it's amazing it just leaves you like it's

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:45.240
like it hurts at first but then it's like oh my god it sounds uncomfortable yeah

01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:59.560
well you should see the other guy all right what's that let's do okay you know

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:12.120
how we let's so so we're gonna do a little game here at Jack and it's called

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:19.040
it's called it's called life crossroads it's an improv game that Rob Schrab and

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:25.300
I do where we we take you back to a point in your life where you you're

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:31.360
wondering like in like you're thinking like what if I had chosen this instead

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:37.080
of that can you conjure that moment in your head like like and what we will do

01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:42.640
is revisit that moment sounds like a terrible idea so like the things would

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:48.040
be dermatology or anything else sure or like anything you could also go back to

01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:52.160
eight years old and be like what if I had taken piano I like whatever you think

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:57.720
is like a really like crucial branch in your life or you're like I really wish

01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:02.480
I could know at least and check in on who I would have been if I had done this

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:09.560
instead of that I know there's a lot of pressure and I can give you a couple

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:14.160
minutes to order I think I don't know what I would have done differently at one

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:17.440
point I wanted to be an engineer I don't think that's significantly different

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:24.440
from like a research scientist but I don't think I'm right it's a choo-choo

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:29.840
train yeah so different I wouldn't want if I was on a train I wouldn't want the

01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:38.480
guy making it go choo-choo to know a lot about skin okay that's a good point see

01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:50.920
dad humor it's fun I think that crossroads is like right now in my life

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:59.840
right okay I think I can look back in 10 years so tell us tell us like a kind

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:05.360
of dilemma you have if you don't mind of like like what's like a radical decision

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:10.440
that you think is on the table that you you're because you're a logical guy and

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:15.000
you're like oh I would never maybe do that but like like I would never do stand

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.600
up but like at this point in my life I'd be I would like think about putting

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:22.440
myself in that position so I'm being on stage here is like one of those things

01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:26.760
where I'm kind of like well do something I'm uncomfortable with so we should show

01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.920
you then what your life would be like if you okay all right you hear that

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:48.080
Schrab okay so here we go so enjoy what if Jack had done stand up instead of

I mean how do you like it how do you like it that's what you did that's

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:54.560

01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:59.480

won yeah so we've done that one that's how you're the coach that's well you know

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:38.880
I won so I guess I jump over the net the skin on my leg is damaged good thing

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:45.800
that before I decided to learn tennis I learned about how to undamaged skin you

01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:52.040
know about skin only damaged skin but you're such a good tennis player in the

01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:57.920
scene we're improvising as stand-ups you know about it'll help me it hurt my

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:02.080
real-life skin hurts because while I was playing a tennis player in this

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:06.120
improv scene at the stand-up club I also actually as a comedic performer David

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:18.120
Spade hurt my real David Spade skin help me Jack it looks hurt if I were a

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:22.120
doctor I might be able to help but I could probably just tell you why it's

01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:30.440
hurt which is that you trauma to the leg you're right and that gives me the

01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:38.680
confidence to finish my set y'all notice that women be shopping

01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:48.120
David Spade went on to become a famous comedian entertaining millions of

01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:53.960
people and have launching his own franchise spade in America and SNL Jack

01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:58.920
learned that his true calling what no matter what field he went into would

01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:06.960
always be to know more about skin than people who did it and so it turned out

01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:11.920
it turned out good it turned out that you your life is good I'm pretty sure I

01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:16.720
started this by saying that the last thing I wanted was to learn more about

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:23.080
skin right yeah I definitely good is not how I feel about the rest of my life at

01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:28.640
this stage you're right but I guess there's a hopeful future in there

01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:34.200
somewhere yeah I mean there might be comfort taken in the idea that you're

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:38.320
trapped you're trapped in your life right yeah like there's a lot of people
