I don't care.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:56.000\nShitty friend.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:02.000\nLike I said to you back there, I don't give a fuck if you like my idea or not.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nI don't like your idea.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nIn fact, I was even thinking about that before.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nAnd then you went off on the thing that had you in a bad mood and you kind of lost yourself\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:13.000\nand you went into autopilot out here and that's fine.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:14.000\nI can do that too.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nHere's my autopilot.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:18.000\nI just go to my little notes here.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:20.000\nOh, Bagel Boss.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nWho hasn't heard enough about that guy?\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nLet's talk about him.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\nDid you see that video, that little guy?\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nI saw the video about that.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:31.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nHis name isn't Bagel Boss.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nOh, I thought he was the Bagel Boss.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nHe went to a place called Bagel Boss.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:42.000\nAm I saying Bagel, right?\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:43.000\nI don't even know.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:44.000\nI wouldn't know.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.000\nWas I?\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:46.000\nBagel.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:47.000\nBagel.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:48.000\nWhat did I say?\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:49.000\nBagel.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nSomething.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nRight?\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:55.000\nYou did a whole season of television off of that, right?\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nYeah, because I don't know.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:02.000\nI say the word Bagel and then people will alternatively go, you still see that or they'll go like,\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nwhy are you saying it right now?\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:08.000\nI don't know what the fuck you're talking about unless I think about it.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:10.000\nI'm not going to think about the word Bagel.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:11.000\nI'm tired of it.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:12.000\nWhatever.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:13.000\nLet's move on.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nThis is not even worth.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:19.000\nI was worried that little Bagel Boss, who's apparently not the boss.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:20.000\nHe's not the boss.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:23.000\nI was worried for five seconds that he would kill himself.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nI think he's a viral guy.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:29.000\nI think I heard that he's like one of these viral guys.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:30.000\nYeah, no.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nHe's having a field check.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nNo.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nHe's one of these people who stages things and is like, ah.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:37.000\nYeah.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:38.000\nHe's done videos before.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nI think he's like the Nylon's boss or something.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:42.000\nGod damn it.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:43.000\nI'm sorry, Spencer.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.000\nI'm cutting you off.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nPlease don't.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:52.000\nWho's got the time, energy, or want to do anything?\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nThe little Bagel guy.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:59.000\nYeah, but I look at that and I go, okay, I understand that on paper.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:07.000\nBut the sheer get up in the morning and the energy that he did.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:10.000\nBut if you have nothing else, I mean, if he could weld things.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:14.000\nI thought it was interesting because he's like a part of his meme is that he was like,\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:18.000\nwhen he yells at the guy, he goes, you're not God, my father.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nAnd then he kind of pauses for a second.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nHe goes, we're my boss.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nAnd I thought, why would you throw that in there?\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nI was like, oh, he's worried he's going to get fired.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:31.000\nWhere does he work that crediting his boss right at the end there is going to make the\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:32.000\ndifference?\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nSpencer, I'm sorry.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:39.000\nI thought he just read the sign on the wall and it was like, oh, right, boss, Bagel boss.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:40.000\nOh, right, okay.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.000\nAnyways, we don't have to talk about Bagel boss.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nOr my Bagel little guy.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:50.000\nI'm at an age now in a kind of world weariness where I was like, the worst thing about that\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:54.000\nstory was I was like, oh, this guy might kill himself.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nLike, this is too much.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nLike, because the video just has him cutting out.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:03.000\nI worried about him for five seconds until you get the rest of the story.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nAnd it turns out like, no, he's a pig and shit.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:06.000\nHe loves it.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nAnd then he's like, that was a big day for him.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:13.000\nYou're looking at one of the most important days of his life.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:18.000\nYou guys hear about this Gamer Girl bathwater?\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:19.000\nNo.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:23.000\nThere's this Gamer Girl what's selling her bathwater.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:27.000\nI like that you said it like a Jed Clampett from the Beverly Hillbillies.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nI love that what's.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nIsn't that funny?\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:32.000\nWhat's as, wait, what are we using what's as when we talk about a hillbilly?\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:33.000\nWho is?\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nSometimes you're like, that is.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nWhat's?\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.000\nYeah, she sold two baths worth of water now, I understand.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:43.000\nHow big are they like energy shot bottles?\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:48.000\nA bit bigger, like less than a pint of ice cream kind of size, but about there.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nLike in a glass.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:50.000\nIs she hot?\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:51.000\nOh yeah.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:52.000\nI mean, I shouldn't say that.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:53.000\nShe's probably young.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:57.000\nI don't think you're supposed to ask it or answer.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:58.000\nWell, I'm trying to.\n\n06:58.000 --> 06:59.000\nOkay.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:00.000\nLet me ask you a different question.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nIs he, is she dirty?\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nI don't know.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nWell, if she took a bath.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nHow dirty is she?\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:13.000\nYeah.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:14.000\nBathwater.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nYeah.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:16.000\nYeah.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nWell, that's, that's, that's good.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:18.000\nTerrific.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nThey'll sell anything.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nThey'll buy anything.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nI bought, thank you for that segue.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nI bought a $1,500 pool robot.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:26.000\nNot my pitches.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nGod damn it.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nNot my pitches.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:32.000\nIt's a pool robot?\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:33.000\nWas it?\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:34.000\nYeah, I bought one of those pool robots.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:35.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:36.000\nHow big is it?\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.000\nHow tall?\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:38.000\nIt's like a six feet tall.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.000\nIt's like a little dune buggy.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:40.000\nRight.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:41.000\nI've got the most expensive one.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nI went to a pool supply store.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:48.000\nAnd I think like pool supply store is like, they must exist in some kind of bubble where\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:51.000\npeople are calling them all the time for like free pool advice.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:55.000\nI think like, if it was a doctor's office, they'd just be like, what's your insurance?\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nAnd people would hang up.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:02.000\nBut a pool place you could just call and be like, hey, how many buckets of water?\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:03.000\nKill a spider.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nYou know, I think I just, I got that impression because the phone was just ringing off the\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nhook the entire time I was there.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nAnd the guy kept answering and he'd go, uh-huh, uh-huh.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nHey, I actually have a customer in the store right now.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nSo can I get back to you?\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nAnd I kept wanting to go, you don't have a, I don't want anything from you.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nI can see a fucking net on a stick.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nLike I don't need your help.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nLike you can talk on the phone all you want.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:27.000\nI'm only here because I don't want to wait a day for the mail.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nAnd I bought a net on a stick and a pool robot.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nFor the bees.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:32.000\nYeah.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nA lot of insect life.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nYou have a lot of bee problems.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nThere's a lot of bees in the pool.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nBees in the pool.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nDid you see I did a Austin Power as a bee t-shirt?\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nI saw that t-shirt.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nI liked it.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nI pressed the heart button for you.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:47.000\nIt's selling.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nIt's really burning up the charts.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:54.000\nOver at Schrab Home Video on my t-shirt page.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.000\nHey, okay.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\nDo you have any of these, uh-\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:57.000\nYes.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nPolish moles, as they call them in Milwaukee.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nNo.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nSkin tags.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:02.000\nYou're not up for Polish descent.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nYou know, I haven't had one in a really long time.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:05.000\nI don't-\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nI got one on my-\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nFuck it.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nIt's disgusting.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nYou know what you do?\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nJust rip it off.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:16.000\nWell, I wanted to ask you about it, but obviously you're going to give joke answers.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nYou know what you do?\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:24.000\nYou get dental floss, and you tie it up, and then it strangles it to death, and it falls off.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:28.000\nBut what about all the talk about, like the reason I have one dangling off of me is because\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:31.000\nat some point in my life, like it injured my consciousness-\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.000\nYou were cursed.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nYou're not supposed to fucking-\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nYou're not supposed to touch them.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nYou're not supposed to mess with them.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:40.000\nWell, I think they do tend to grow back, but I've read that about those things.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nThey do fall off.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nThey do fall off on their own.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nThey can fall off.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.760\nI had one of my collarbone ones that grew, and I was convinced I had cancer for a week,\n\n09:45.760 --> 09:49.000\nand then it just fell off one day.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nBut I've got this one on my arm that-\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.000\nIs it new?\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nIt looks like a little Quato.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nNo, it's very old.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.000\nOkay.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:56.000\nI'm just letting it-\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nI'm giving it crackers.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.000\nThere's this-\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:07.000\nThere's this wart remover that comes in like kind of like, you know, like when you spray\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:13.000\nlike air spray, like canned air, and you turn it upside down, and it feels cold, and then\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:14.000\nblows out smoke.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.300\nYeah, you used to run around my apartment pretending to fart.\n\n10:17.300 --> 10:18.300\nYou loved that.\n\n10:18.300 --> 10:21.720\nThe day you found that out, if you held the can upside down, it would shoot visible like\n\n10:21.720 --> 10:22.720\nair out.\n\n10:22.720 --> 10:23.720\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n10:23.720 --> 10:24.720\nAnd you would like-\n\n10:24.720 --> 10:31.360\nYou went through a case of canned air, standing in doorways going like shooting like white\n\n10:31.360 --> 10:32.360\nsmoke out of your butt.\n\n10:32.360 --> 10:34.400\nDoes anybody have any canned air?\n\n10:34.400 --> 10:35.960\nI don't think they understand.\n\n10:35.960 --> 10:38.840\nIs there canned air in the building?\n\n10:38.840 --> 10:41.960\nCan somebody go get some canned air?\n\n10:41.960 --> 10:45.040\nI don't think I can visualize it if you hold it upside down, it makes sense.\n\n10:45.040 --> 10:49.680\nThere's like this wart remover where what it does is like it's a little can of like\n\n10:49.680 --> 10:50.680\nwhatever-\n\n10:50.680 --> 10:51.680\nIt freezes it.\n\n10:51.680 --> 10:52.680\nIt's not a wart.\n\n10:52.680 --> 10:55.840\nWell, but the thing is, is it'll freeze it and it'll fall off quicker.\n\n10:55.840 --> 10:57.320\nOkay, but you can just strangle it.\n\n10:57.320 --> 10:58.320\nIt could cut it off.\n\n10:58.320 --> 10:59.320\nI'm told you're not supposed to-\n\n10:59.320 --> 11:00.320\nYeah, but that'll hurt.\n\n11:00.320 --> 11:01.320\nIf you freeze it off-\n\n11:01.320 --> 11:02.320\nI'm not worried about the pain.\n\n11:02.320 --> 11:03.320\nThen cut it off.\n\n11:03.320 --> 11:04.320\nThen pull it off.\n\n11:04.320 --> 11:05.320\nThen bite it off.\n\n11:05.320 --> 11:06.320\nThat's okay.\n\n11:06.320 --> 11:10.680\nThe reason I'm asking you is because in my mind, people don't touch them, don't fuck\n\n11:10.680 --> 11:11.680\nwith them, right?\n\n11:11.680 --> 11:12.680\nAnybody?\n\n11:12.680 --> 11:13.680\nYeah.\n\n11:13.680 --> 11:15.000\nIt's been put in my head.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:19.600\nI don't know if this is true or not, but it's in my head the idea that if you remove\n\n11:19.600 --> 11:27.440\nthem, it could cause cancer.\n\n11:27.440 --> 11:28.440\nI mean-\n\n11:28.440 --> 11:29.440\nThey're cancer minds?\n\n11:29.440 --> 11:30.440\nWell, that's gotta be-\n\n11:30.440 --> 11:37.400\nI'm hoping you're not a doctor because I don't want that to be totally true.\n\n11:37.400 --> 11:40.440\nI don't, I don't, I don't believe that.\n\n11:40.440 --> 11:44.520\nBut that's sort of what I, I got the idea that what it is is that, well, those things\n\n11:44.520 --> 11:48.000\nare cells gone mad, which is what cancer is.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.720\nBut these things are contained at least to you, like your East European heritage in\n\n11:52.720 --> 11:59.040\nterms of like, I'll just put a bubble on this person's eyelid, just so they can get through\n\n11:59.040 --> 12:00.800\nthis documentary about UFOs in Russia.\n\n12:00.800 --> 12:01.800\nThink about this.\n\n12:01.800 --> 12:02.800\nThink about this.\n\n12:02.800 --> 12:03.800\nThink about this.\n\n12:03.800 --> 12:06.320\nIt's cancer that's trying to get out of your body.\n\n12:06.320 --> 12:07.320\nRight, exactly.\n\n12:07.320 --> 12:08.320\nAnd so when you-\n\n12:08.320 --> 12:09.320\nIt's growing now.\n\n12:09.320 --> 12:12.520\nWhen you fuck with it, you're like actually hacking the mainframe of a thing that's already\n\n12:12.520 --> 12:13.520\non the edge.\n\n12:13.520 --> 12:16.280\nIt's like the Jack Nicholson of cells.\n\n12:16.280 --> 12:19.440\nAnd like, you don't want to give it an excuse to do witches of Eastwick.\n\n12:19.440 --> 12:21.440\nAll right.\n\n12:21.440 --> 12:22.440\nI riffed that.\n\n12:22.440 --> 12:27.320\nLike, in the moment, I was kind of proud of it, but it's not like, it's not like, oh,\n\n12:27.320 --> 12:32.920\nwhich is Eastwick, and I was his Ishtar, and I was like, I don't know.\n\n12:32.920 --> 12:33.920\nThanks.\n\n12:33.920 --> 12:34.920\nThanks.\n\n12:34.920 --> 12:36.640\nSometimes that's all we need.\n\n12:36.640 --> 12:37.640\nWhat?\n\n12:37.640 --> 12:41.560\nJust like one guy at medium volume saying, good.\n\n12:41.560 --> 12:42.560\nI like that.\n\n12:42.560 --> 12:43.560\nYeah, I do.\n\n12:43.560 --> 12:44.560\nYeah.\n\n12:44.560 --> 12:45.560\nI like that.\n\n12:45.560 --> 12:46.560\nIt's good.\n\n12:46.560 --> 12:47.560\nIt's good.\n\n12:47.560 --> 12:50.120\nLike, I'm actually now thinking in my head, does it need to be a guy?\n\n12:50.120 --> 12:51.120\nCould it be a woman?\n\n12:51.120 --> 12:53.120\nWould it be different if it was a woman?\n\n12:53.120 --> 13:01.480\nBecause I know, I mean, I listened to Tori Amis for a lady going, good boy.\n\n13:01.480 --> 13:03.600\nThat would be OK.\n\n13:03.600 --> 13:05.560\nThat's a little bit of all right right there.\n\n13:05.560 --> 13:06.560\nI don't think it would work.\n\n13:06.560 --> 13:11.640\nI think I would project like Freudian impulses on it.\n\n13:11.640 --> 13:13.840\nI would be like, no, you're lying.\n\n13:13.840 --> 13:15.840\nThey all lie.\n\n13:15.840 --> 13:19.400\nOK, too soon.\n\n13:19.400 --> 13:20.520\nToo common.\n\n13:20.520 --> 13:21.520\nToo common.\n\n13:21.520 --> 13:22.520\nGood damn.\n\n13:22.520 --> 13:24.320\nI don't think there's any more to pretend to be misogynist.\n\n13:24.320 --> 13:26.960\nBut you can go down the street and get real misogyny anywhere.\n\n13:26.960 --> 13:28.680\nWhy is your fake misogyny funny?\n\n13:28.680 --> 13:29.680\nIt's not.\n\n13:29.680 --> 13:30.760\nIs there another show?\n\n13:30.760 --> 13:31.760\nYeah.\n\n13:31.760 --> 13:36.780\nLike, it's Chuck E. T. he's going like, hey.\n\n13:36.780 --> 13:38.640\nHey, you like, you like my dungle?\n\n13:38.640 --> 13:39.640\nLook at what?\n\n13:39.640 --> 13:40.640\nYeah, what the fuck is that?\n\n13:40.640 --> 13:42.040\nI got this thing on Amazon.\n\n13:42.040 --> 13:46.720\nIt's like, it's backing up my phone right now.\n\n13:46.720 --> 13:48.680\nIt's 19.3% finished.\n\n13:48.680 --> 13:49.680\nTo what?\n\n13:49.680 --> 13:50.680\nTo it?\n\n13:50.680 --> 13:51.680\nYeah.\n\n13:51.680 --> 13:55.280\nand it's got look it looks like a ninja star I don't know if that's racist to\n\n13:55.280 --> 14:02.480\nsay now but it just it has like it's a four it's a four pronged thing like a\n\n14:02.480 --> 14:08.200\nlike a cross kind of yeah it's got it's got a different it's got a micro USB a\n\n14:08.200 --> 14:14.680\nlightning a USB-C and a regular USB respectively as you go around the\n\n14:14.680 --> 14:19.840\nperimeter of the karate star and and it's it's plugged into my phone right now\n\n14:19.840 --> 14:22.360\nwhich means that right after I could pull this out and plug it into\n\n14:22.360 --> 14:30.040\nostensibly an internet laptop yeah with even less storage than my phone\n\n14:30.040 --> 14:33.800\nanyways but once you start backing something up I can I can't pull this\n\n14:33.800 --> 14:40.080\nout no it's terrifying I don't know anything about the whole thing how many\n\n14:40.080 --> 14:44.640\nhow many storages do you how many gigs are in each device that's attached well\n\n14:44.640 --> 14:52.080\nI'm I'm I'm maybe coining this phrase but I'm what you call a snowball in in\n\n14:52.080 --> 14:56.880\nthe Apple douchebag community in that I bought the first iPhone and have bought\n\n14:56.880 --> 15:02.040\nevery successive iPhone and have basically only ever transferred all of my\n\n15:02.040 --> 15:08.640\ninformation from my first iPhone to this iPhone I'm seven iPhones in and they\n\n15:08.640 --> 15:14.880\nkeep expanding the storage so I have never like ever dumped my phone's content\n\n15:14.880 --> 15:19.800\nout anywhere for safekeeping so you're dodging the question wait sorry what\n\n15:19.800 --> 15:24.360\nwhat I how many how many storages do you have on it how many how many gigs is it\n\n15:24.360 --> 15:27.920\nbacking up how many gigs can that device back I think this thing is smaller\n\n15:27.920 --> 15:35.400\nthan my phone that's what I was guessing yeah but I'm hoping that maybe that just\n\n15:35.400 --> 15:39.920\nthe photos just the photo roll oh if you could do that we'll just go on here yeah\n\n15:39.920 --> 15:48.000\nyeah yeah I mean we don't want to I do I got two hours baby I mean we don't have\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:54.000\nto talk about anything really I we could meditate yeah I'm pretty much done I've\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:59.000\nbeen I've been binging the golden girls with with Cody which I know is like a\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:03.480\nkind of a hipster thing like you're supposed you know like oh yeah girls but\n\n16:03.480 --> 16:11.480\nbut like as a sitcom writer of advancing age with a girlfriend who like would\n\n16:11.480 --> 16:14.520\nwatch it with her parents I think when she was a kid or something it was\n\n16:14.520 --> 16:17.720\nnostalgic value for her but we will start watching it it was like you know\n\n16:17.720 --> 16:21.440\nit's like hate watching it first kind of like yeah he's old like who gives a\n\n16:21.440 --> 16:27.060\nshit fucking golden girls like golden girls and golden girls three or four\n\n16:27.060 --> 16:30.000\nepisodes into the first season you're kind of like I think there's something\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:35.640\nspecial happening here it is I want to be very clear because we're you know we\n\n16:35.640 --> 16:39.420\nlive in a culture where it's too it's too convenient for people to be like this\n\n16:39.420 --> 16:44.440\nis genius and you know like I don't know I mean look it television is a\n\n16:44.440 --> 16:50.520\nderivative medium the multi-camp sitcom is the worst of the worst but it's as\n\n16:50.520 --> 16:56.720\nfar as like what you know on some spectrum of like I don't know fucking\n\n16:56.720 --> 17:01.960\ncoolness you know you're dealing in drivel but like at the same time you\n\n17:01.960 --> 17:05.080\nhave to recognize that there's a craft there like you you know when you've\n\n17:05.080 --> 17:11.640\nwatched a shitty multi-cam sitcom versus a good one and and then and then\n\n17:11.640 --> 17:15.360\nthere but then there's not just that one dial because I'm watching golden girls\n\n17:15.360 --> 17:18.800\nI'm like I would never I don't think I would stick with this for multiple\n\n17:18.800 --> 17:23.560\nepisodes but I'm so old now that I was starting to like dial into this thing of\n\n17:23.560 --> 17:28.160\nlike geez this thing is kind of genius just in it's I think like all I can I\n\n17:28.160 --> 17:33.360\ncan do is it feels like a solar powered moped or something like it's take I was\n\n17:33.360 --> 17:37.600\njust like this show must be so fucking cheap like they never leave their house\n\n17:37.600 --> 17:41.960\nand they just keep talking about the same shit like one of them might get\n\n17:41.960 --> 17:46.760\nmarried and the other three are freaking out about it and like but it's like it\n\n17:46.760 --> 17:50.600\njust starts to like take on this like very you're like holy shit in terms of\n\n17:50.600 --> 17:54.680\nlike the amount of energy going in versus the amount of energy coming out\n\n17:54.680 --> 18:00.200\nthis thing is actually like a like a some miracle of sitcom technology like\n\n18:00.200 --> 18:05.440\nlike a Dyson sphere but like with it it's just like what how is this so and it\n\n18:05.440 --> 18:10.840\nreally does earn all of that like kind of you know hipster kind of like well\n\n18:10.840 --> 18:15.440\nit's pretty it is pretty progressive it means like all female cast plus they're\n\n18:15.440 --> 18:21.240\nall yeah older they're not fuckable which is pretty amazing what you guys\n\n18:21.240 --> 18:28.360\nreally they're like oh you know I mean like when I wouldn't put it that harshly\n\n18:28.360 --> 18:33.000\nwhat if one of them is listening was that what that was they knew we're going\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:36.480\ninto it that that's what I mean the only time is seriously the only time\n\n18:36.480 --> 18:40.880\nsomething like that will ever happen again is if they reboot golden girls\n\n18:40.880 --> 18:45.640\nright like there they'll nobody's gonna go let's get a bunch of we want the next\n\n18:45.640 --> 18:50.480\ngolden girls or whatever I mean was designing women on the same network or\n\n18:50.480 --> 18:54.720\nwas it like designing women was NBC I don't know what was what was golden girls\n\n18:54.720 --> 18:59.800\nthen well I have no idea I don't really see the Tarantino episode of golden girl\n\n18:59.800 --> 19:03.520\nno I haven't seen that yet yeah he didn't write or direct it if that's what\n\n19:03.520 --> 19:06.200\nyou're hoping but there is it you get through the first season and you can\n\n19:06.200 --> 19:09.160\ntell there's something magical while you watch a first season of a show and you\n\n19:09.160 --> 19:15.160\ncan kind of see like like oh they're operating in total darkness like like\n\n19:15.160 --> 19:20.000\nthey're on a soundstage somewhere and they they have no idea you know they\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:24.400\nlike like they don't know they're gonna be syndicated they don't know there's\n\n19:24.400 --> 19:27.760\nprobably who knows how these show you know they might have banked 25 episodes\n\n19:27.760 --> 19:30.320\nbefore they aired a single one I have no idea what the history of that show is but\n\n19:30.320 --> 19:35.720\nyou know it's okay just a real almost criminal simplicity to the first season\n\n19:35.720 --> 19:39.600\nwhich is went through all 25 episodes and it's kind of like it was very\n\n19:39.600 --> 19:43.360\ninterested too in this idea of like obviously that note of schmuck bait what\n\n19:43.360 --> 19:48.200\ndidn't exist back then because golden girls is like season one is like if you\n\n19:48.200 --> 19:52.720\nwere ever gonna get the note of schmuck bait from what do you mean schmuck bait\n\n19:52.720 --> 19:58.800\nschmuck bait is when is is just like in broadcast sitcoms it would be like a note\n\n19:58.800 --> 20:04.720\nyou'd get that where like you can't expect the audience to believe their\n\n20:04.720 --> 20:10.200\nstakes here so like like oh Barney Miller is gonna retire in like an episode\n\n20:10.200 --> 20:14.960\n17 of Barney Miller where like what why would the show yeah it's like schmuck\n\n20:14.960 --> 20:20.680\nbait like we know that's not gonna happen so don't so like oh this is like do\n\n20:20.680 --> 20:25.040\nyou think the audience is a schmuck like why would you be pretending that this\n\n20:25.040 --> 20:37.240\nis allowable as a good story oh shit kettle one the breakfast thank you guys\n\n20:37.240 --> 20:44.920\nson god this place is so fancy I don't know why I didn't know he was here kettle\n\n20:44.920 --> 20:50.360\none audience zero yeah that was Jeff Davis for those of you\n\n20:50.360 --> 20:55.920\nJeff Davis came in with a bucket of ice he presented the kettle one and Dan sat\n\n20:55.920 --> 21:00.040\ndown you never got the schmuck bait note you got it when we were writing\n\n21:00.040 --> 21:03.960\ntogether we've got the schmuck bait no it kind of goes hand-in-hand with the\n\n21:03.960 --> 21:08.040\nshould I stay or should I go which is like that's that's like a category of\n\n21:08.040 --> 21:12.480\nschmuck bait where if you're writing a pilot like I like you can't you can't\n\n21:12.480 --> 21:17.720\nspend your pilot having the protagonist go I don't know should I be here or not\n\n21:17.720 --> 21:24.440\nlike oh

one of the\n\n21:47.080 --> 21:49.680\ngolden girls was worried that one of the other golden girls was gonna move out\n\n21:49.680 --> 21:53.800\nand it was like come on that's the one thing we know

22:58.520\nheavily on the budget was low probably the and then it was like explosively\n\n22:58.520 --> 23:04.560\npopular and then like one can only imagine who knows you can speculate\n\n23:04.560

of it I want you to tell me specifically that I need I need you as\n\n28:55.560 --> 29:02.960\nyour therapist I need you to name your your goal like you're saying I don't\n\n29:02.960 --> 29:07.080\nknow anymore I don't know right I really don't know well that's a ticket to\n\n29:07.080 --> 29:12.240\ndepression and I mean that's I don't know I mean I thought I did and you know\n\n29:12.240 --> 29:17.960\nbut it just seems then then I mean I then I only would say is then that's like\n\n29:17.960 --> 29:20.920\nsometimes we go through those phases where we don't know what we want and\n\n29:20.920 --> 29:24.800\nthose are those are you know the grass is always greener but there's a lot of\n\n29:24.800 --> 29:28.240\npeople who know what they want who when they look at people who don't know what\n\n29:28.240 --> 29:34.440\nthey want are like must be nice like because they like they know for sure\n\n29:34.440 --> 29:39.200\nthat all they have to do before they can fucking relax is get these MRI results\n\n29:39.200 --> 29:44.560\nor like finish this internship or turn in this theme paper or whatever the fuck\n\n29:44.560 --> 29:50.360\npoor people do the and they they have that they're locked in that maze and all\n\n29:50.360 --> 29:54.240\nthey can look forward to is like this for like for a lot of Americans it's the\n\n29:54.240 --> 29:57.600\nmyth of retirement for but we're all doing it to ourselves every day we're\n\n29:57.600 --> 30:02.840\nlike I just got to get this and then we're gonna find out who regarding\n\n30:02.840 --> 30:07.600\nHenry really is you know like what kind of rich crackers am I into like it's a\n\n30:07.600 --> 30:15.600\ngood movie you should check it out so you're in a place when you're feeling\n\n30:15.600 --> 30:20.960\nlike this where you get to now just fucking I mean the thing that you're\n\n30:20.960 --> 30:28.400\ndepressed about is it's bad you should be depressed about being depressed about\n\n30:28.400 --> 30:33.920\nthat because that makes you a loser I heard about it and I was like what a\n\n30:33.920 --> 30:40.520\nloser I appreciate that and I understand that but it's it's a symptom of a\n\n30:40.520 --> 30:45.320\ngreater thing if you're my therapist you know that already yeah come on I thought\n\n30:45.320 --> 30:50.360\nI'm talking about the greater thing yeah and so am I yeah like I think you're in\n\n30:50.360 --> 30:55.240\na good you should well I'm not saying you should be happy oh shit what could\n\n30:55.240 --> 31:02.000\nhappen what could happen a tie could go on the lampshade oh wait a minute the\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:09.480\nlampshade lampshade is the neck what what head could come next I don't I don't\n\n31:09.480 --> 31:14.800\nthink he can do it I don't think there's a head oh but I shudder to wait I don't\n\n31:14.800 --> 31:21.240\nthink the head can fit on top of that you hear that Jeff that's a challenge man\n\n31:21.240 --> 31:27.380\nalso like the lampshade could go upside down but then the tie wouldn't fit why\n\n31:27.380 --> 31:31.560\nwould you put the lampshade upside down it would be easier it would fit easier\n\n31:31.560 --> 31:35.960\nover the top of the bottle really it's oh yeah I could demonstrate but why would\n\n31:35.960 --> 31:40.600\nI do that well it's looking like it's working right I know I'm not I'm not\n\n31:40.600 --> 31:44.240\ntrying to everybody listening at home I like the idea well there's what there's\n\n31:44.240 --> 31:48.800\nyeah but let's not talk about anything other than Jeff's bit until Jeff comes\n\n31:48.800 --> 31:53.440\nout again that would be good go because so that he's not taking focus from\n\n31:53.440 --> 32:00.240\nanything he has to slowly eat himself I think that's happening yeah that's why\n\n32:00.240 --> 32:06.440\nI'm not eager to move on we should ask Jeff he's got shoes okay now he's\n\n32:06.440 --> 32:11.200\nputting shoes out and they're at the foot of the chair what kind of golem are\n\n32:11.200 --> 32:19.000\nyou making you guys know about this golem the Jewish golem you put like a\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:23.040\nslip of paper in its mouth the thing it says you say you know about the golem\n\n32:23.040 --> 32:27.920\noh leavey knows all about it leavey hey leavey you're Jewish tell me about the\n\n32:27.920 --> 32:37.240\ngolem is that like your Santa Claus come on yeah that's true golem is made out\n\n32:37.240 --> 32:42.720\nof clay made out of clay basically the first robot yeah right made out of

got it I think you\n\n32:56.080 --> 33:02.400\ncan't I think the key is yeah you're gonna add the issue magic otherwise when\n\n33:02.400 --> 33:06.880\nyou're using it as a descriptor you can't just stop at the shoe like you can't be\n\n33:06.880 --> 33:14.400\nlike I got in one of those Jew limousines this is based on fact a golem is\n\n33:14.400 --> 33:18.160\nmade out of Jew magic you can't know I mean I'm just I'm just telling you\n\n33:18.160 --> 33:22.960\nlinguistically what I've come to find I think is like the you know like it's a\n\n33:22.960 --> 33:29.520\nnew I should be saying Jewish or Hebrew magic I was yeah great this is a clay\n\n33:29.520 --> 33:40.440\nmade robot infused with Hebrew magic thank you brought to life via the Hebrew\n\n33:40.440 --> 33:46.120\nfaith you

okay okay you know it's\n\n34:16.640 --> 34:21.160\nwe got okay but look you let me tell it so that I can protect myself a little\n\n34:21.160 --> 34:29.240\nbit in my mind just locker room humor it was a little boy who was like\n\n34:29.240 --> 34:34.960\nscooting past Rob's car on this like crazy contraption that like has like\n\n34:34.960 --> 34:39.280\nthis like like 90 wheels and like a big boomerang handlebar or something and\n\n34:39.280 --> 34:44.360\nhe was like a very well-dressed boy with like it was Saturday it might have been\n\n34:44.360 --> 34:50.400\nwhat do you call it Shabbat or something he had a yama Khan and and he he was\n\n34:50.400 --> 34:54.480\nriding on this crazy contraption and Schrab said as the little boy rode by is\n\n34:54.480 --> 34:58.160\nlike wait what do you call that thing and the kid was like a yanger flanger or\n\n34:58.160 --> 35:01.840\nwhatever the thing is called the brand name and Schrab's like maybe you should\n\n35:01.840 --> 35:05.400\nget one of those to me and I'm like why are you doing this to me and just leave\n\n35:05.400 --> 35:09.040\nand then and then I went back inside and I just knew I do the timing of it because\n\n35:09.040 --> 35:11.800\nRob would be like on the freeway by the time I texted and I was just like I\n\n35:11.800 --> 35:18.320\nthought they were called yama cuz if you said to the kid like what is those\n\n35:18.320 --> 35:22.520\nthings called and he was like a yanger flanger and it was like as if they were\n\n35:22.520 --> 35:29.880\ntalking about his hat I just thought the timing of it would be funny cuz it\n\n35:29.880 --> 35:34.880\nwould be like a big long pause okay is this a good bit okay I've got a bit for\n\n35:34.880 --> 35:40.080\nyou okay it's tell me and

no be like an award for most bagel bosses killed you know we\n\n51:14.320 --> 51:18.600\nnever finished the you never got a chance to explain what the fuck happened\n\n51:18.600 --> 51:23.400\nwith the bees is as uneventful as it was like I like we introduced the segment\n\n51:23.400 --> 51:28.360\nSpencer explains what happened with the bees and oh I didn't notice that did\n\n51:28.360 --> 51:32.520\nthat happen did I not I thought I told the whole story yeah well what what what\n\n51:32.520 --> 51:36.640\nI I want the mundane story because I've never witnessed bees being like\n\n51:36.640 --> 51:40.480\nexcavated from a wall before what happened all right so the guy who did\n\n51:40.480 --> 51:43.640\nthe estimate he was like we're gonna have to open the wall close the wall we\n\n51:43.640 --> 51:48.040\nwere working construction it'll be bang bang boom the guy comes out he's like\n\n51:48.040 --> 51:52.880\noh this is a retaining wall who gave you this estimate and I was like I don't know\n\n51:52.880 --> 51:56.640\nhe was like young some young he was like some young guy like Anthony and I'm like\n\n51:56.640 --> 52:00.960\nI don't know sure and he was like yeah this is a retaining wall you don't want\n\n52:00.960 --> 52:04.320\nto damage in it retaining wall you know mess with a structural integrity we can\n\n52:04.320 --> 52:09.000\nrepair it but it's never gonna be the same kind of wall I'm like well there's\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:15.440\nstill bees and the and the bees are now being used as an excuse by the fifth in\n\n52:15.440 --> 52:21.840\na series of children's crusades to like make my stereo work yeah we thought it\n\n52:21.840 --> 52:26.560\nwas yeah and now I've moved out of the house and probably investing in apple\n\n52:26.560 --> 52:30.840\nhome pods and never gonna look back but at least all those children died people\n\n52:30.840 --> 52:34.920\nare just gonna yeah so what did they all right so what did they do they just\n\n52:34.920 --> 52:39.880\nwalked away from the retaining wall he was like he was like okay so he looked\n\n52:39.880 --> 52:43.720\nat it and thought about it a bit he was like okay so well what I'm gonna do is\n\n52:43.720 --> 52:47.720\nI'm gonna dig down because the retaining wall is up against a hill and so there's\n\n52:47.720 --> 52:51.160\na bunch of dirt so you can stand in front of the wall and shovel down with the\n\n52:51.160 --> 52:54.960\nshovel and I was like okay that sounds great he was like do you got a shovel\n\n52:54.960 --> 53:00.640\nand I'm like I could get a shovel so he's standing up up where the coyotes go\n\n53:00.640 --> 53:06.120\nno no he's up there no no so you have this it's the patio wall against which is\n\n53:06.120 --> 53:12.520\nlike the the barbecue and stuff you know that lower wall oh that wall yeah\n\n53:12.520 --> 53:17.160\nthat's the one the bees are all up on it's a little short wall yeah oh okay so\n\n53:17.160 --> 53:20.760\nhe's like standing over you know chest high and kind of just hacking at it with\n\n53:20.760 --> 53:25.720\nthe garden trowel that I found so he's using the garden trowel he digs it must\n\n53:25.720 --> 53:29.320\nhave been like five feet I don't know like he did it very fast but I was like\n\n53:29.320 --> 53:33.520\nI feel like you're gonna need a bigger shovel or something he did not need a\n\n53:33.520 --> 53:36.640\nbigger shovel he didn't need buckets he just kind of tossed the dirt backwards\n\n53:36.640 --> 53:42.680\nnot backwards behind him like up up the hill and he eventually got he got down\n\n53:42.680 --> 53:49.920\nthere enough and then he turns on the bee vacuum there's a bee vacuum oh and\n\n53:49.920 --> 53:55.400\nhe's just vacuuming bees for like an hour I want to say like an hour and a half\n\n53:55.400 --> 54:01.120\nand the bee vacuum looks very much like a shop vac that's just that's just it\n\n54:01.120 --> 54:06.960\nprobably is it probably well if it isn't I would be like get a shop back yeah but\n\n54:06.960 --> 54:11.680\nit's attached to one of these bee boxes like it's a big you know maybe quadruple\n\n54:11.680 --> 54:16.280\nshoebox size wooden box and I'm like well how do you you know how do you take the\n\n54:16.280 --> 54:20.000\nlid off that thing there's just bees all over the place but I you know I'm not\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:25.080\nasking questions you just take that box and sell it to like almond farmers who\n\n54:25.080 --> 54:29.760\nare like not paying top price for like here's your bee colony you wanted to\n\n54:29.760 --> 54:32.880\npollinate your fucking orchard that's like little do they know they're like\n\n54:32.880 --> 54:37.880\nthese embattled confused traumatized yeah with no queen who are just like\n\n54:37.880 --> 54:41.320\nangry at the world I asked him what he did with the bees and he said he puts it\n\n54:41.320 --> 54:47.960\nin a cardboard box and sends it to an enemy you made a new friend yeah yeah\n\n54:47.960 --> 54:53.000\nwe were great I was like you know this bagel box guy how did you how did he say\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:57.760\nthat last part did he like give you like a little wink at the end or go well he\n\n54:57.760 --> 55:02.200\nnudged me in the ribs with his knee with his elbow did you really know none of\n\n55:02.200 --> 55:07.680\nthis I there doesn't even a bee guy I just hit it with a pose no okay so he\n\n55:07.680 --> 55:12.640\ndoesn't he doesn't send the bee box to his enemies okay he doesn't know he\n\n55:12.640 --> 55:16.240\ndoesn't he didn't say that that was an embellishment no I thought that might be\n\n55:16.240 --> 55:20.080\na funny thing to say it might also might be true that it's a funny thing that he\n\n55:20.080 --> 55:23.120\nwould say because he's in that business that would have been funnier if he\n\n55:23.120 --> 55:26.520\nactually said it yeah right but he's earnest no he's just a he's just a\n\n55:26.520 --> 55:30.200\nconsummate professional this guy okay he had a cool-looking apiarist outfit you\n\n55:30.200 --> 55:34.600\nknow in Minecraft you can make one but it takes a fucking eight what an apiarist\n\n55:34.600 --> 55:42.360\nis a bee man yeah what what say it's lower and louder apiarist api ar ist\n\n55:42.360 --> 55:49.440\napiarist be is nowhere in now apiary is a bee thing apiary is like a bee house\n\n55:49.440 --> 55:57.040\nor something but it's ape don't don't I'm trying I know but just so I can be\n\n55:57.040 --> 56:04.240\nas smart as you what if I'm smart I'll be what's the name of a so like a bug\n\n56:04.240 --> 56:10.320\nscientist is like an entomologist no it's it's not though but it's like\n\n56:10.320 --> 56:14.040\nentomology has nothing to do with bug or insect or anything it's just a word\n\n56:14.040 --> 56:19.600\nthat's is that means the thing yeah it's just language it's all due to etymology\n\n56:19.600 --> 56:24.480\nwhich has nothing to do with insects yeah all right come on so he vacuums up\n\n56:24.480 --> 56:32.040\njust like will you stop for a second your quest for fucking truth about every\n\n56:32.040 --> 56:40.080\nword I just there's just words and yeah yeah I hope you do but there's bees he\n\n56:40.080 --> 56:45.120\nvacuumed them up put them in his bee box he takes off the top of this bee vacuum\n\n56:45.120 --> 56:48.760\nthere's a little screen down there the bees can't come out I don't know how\n\n56:48.760 --> 56:53.280\nthat happens because the bee vacuum was on top of that screen huh so maybe the\n\n56:53.280 --> 56:56.960\nscreen slides in through some but then like the bee could get out from there I\n\n56:56.960 --> 57:00.720\ndon't know I didn't question it he had the bees in a box there's something like\n\n57:00.720 --> 57:05.120\nthree four hundred bees there is still about sixteen twenty bees maybe forty\n\n57:05.120 --> 57:08.400\nbees kind of flying around buzzing around the outside he got all the honey\n\n57:08.400 --> 57:13.200\ncomb up out of there and I think he put it in a trash bag I know it would have\n\n57:13.200 --> 57:17.120\nbeen delicious you a little taste he didn't even hand it off to a bear did\n\n57:17.120 --> 57:21.760\nhe mention the queen he did not I did not ask about the queen still in there\n\n57:21.760 --> 57:25.120\nno presumably the queen was taken with it because he got the queen would have\n\n57:25.120 --> 57:33.240\nbeen you know say sick put what do you call it but sacrosanct sacrosanct it\n\n57:33.240 --> 57:36.880\nwould have been stationed up in the honey comb which he removed and I don't\n\n57:36.880 --> 57:41.480\nknow if you kill the queen I think you don't kill the queen if you can avoid\n\n57:41.480 --> 57:46.840\nit but yeah I think you just maybe just vacuumed it up it's like God it's like\n\n57:46.840 --> 57:51.240\nvery thick in the host yeah you expected me at the end he goes oh that was the\n\n57:51.240 --> 57:58.120\nqueen yeah exactly just splits onto I guess professional apiarists like\n\n57:58.120 --> 58:02.640\npeople that cultivate bees what they'll do is they you could just smoke the bees\n\n58:02.640 --> 58:09.800\nwhich I make some more man number one why does why does spraying smoke all\n\n58:09.800 --> 58:16.360\nover bees calm them down what a dumb design I think they can't see and they\n\n58:16.360 --> 58:21.280\njust kind of like that should be a pretty fundamental thing for all life is like oh\n\n58:21.280 --> 58:27.520\nthere's smoke I should get like upset about let me tell you this if you're\n\n58:27.520 --> 58:32.920\ndriving and there's a fog do you drive faster you drive more calmly no I drive\n\n58:32.920 --> 58:40.160\nslower okay but I think I think it's much more more okay all right look oh be\n\n58:40.160 --> 58:47.280\nhigh it's not working very well for bees there it's it is an exploitable defect\n\n58:47.280 --> 58:51.320\nin their fucking consciousness that they react to smoke that way I think it's\n\n58:51.320 --> 58:55.520\nmore like when you park in your garage and you leave your window open and the\n\n58:55.520 --> 59:00.120\nengine running and then you fall asleep and then you die I think it's more like\n\n59:00.120 --> 59:03.400\nthat oh you think they're getting a high off the smoke well not high so much is\n\n59:03.400 --> 59:07.160\nsuffocating right they're not they're not taking in as much right and I think\n\n59:07.160 --> 59:11.880\nthey yeah they don't they because I think some of them get a little I don't\n\n59:11.880 --> 59:15.080\nthink so I don't think it's enough to kill poisoning them but it was roofing\n\n59:15.080 --> 59:18.560\nthem yeah I don't know that they hack and cough and scream running out of the\n\n59:18.560 --> 59:21.280\nbuilding you know but some of them do I think some of them get a lot more pissed\n\n59:21.280 --> 59:24.840\noff when when the smoke is happening I don't know and the whole thing is he's\n\n59:24.840 --> 59:28.120\nin a fucking outfit anyway what does it matter if the bees are pissed or not\n\n59:28.120 --> 59:32.360\npissed they're not gonna do anything he's like impenetrable yeah if people that\n\n59:32.360 --> 59:35.840\nmade the people that deal with bees all the time to make honey or whatever the\n\n59:35.840 --> 59:39.040\nfuck they're doing they they they're in the busy you know you just get queens\n\n59:39.040 --> 59:44.720\nthrough the mail and then like you queens have a certain lifespan five seven\n\n59:44.720 --> 59:51.040\nyears or something it's like your bee colony needs to be a little less sluggish\n\n59:51.040 --> 59:54.680\nthan that they'll get high on the hog at the end of Queen Victoria's like rain\n\n59:54.680 --> 01:00:00.760\nand like you you the they they'll just pull out the queen put a new queen in\n\n01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:05.840\nthere and the bees will be like okay cool yeah I guess we're making honey for her\n\n01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.480\nnow exactly like what an exploitable bunch of numerons you know they use\n\n01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.400\nI mean they're flying insects that have stingers on their bodies they have no\n\n01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:19.640\nidea how close they are to being like so like they could they could have taken\n\n01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:24.480\nover like that oh yeah and then I mean we're I'm terrified of them and then and\n\n01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.280\nit's extra terrifying when you learn that they're like super intelligent they\n\n01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.440\nhave their own alphabet and they like make these hexagonal fucking thing like\n\n01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.400\nJesus Christ this that's scary shit they could have like like they just need to\n\n01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.240\nbe a little more evil and they could they would really have us over a barrel\n\n01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.640\nand stellar bees they're making like chapstick for us they're hanging out\n\n01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.760\nand they're on the endangered list along with every other fucking thing yeah\n\n01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:59.760\nbig dummies way to go your big dumb shit bees yeah yeah you're on the list\n\n01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:06.920\nalong with your dopey gorillas your dumb fucked your afts stupid ants you\n\n01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:14.640\nfucking foxes stupid ass clover eating deer I have fucking marmots whatever\n\n01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:21.240\nthat is mammoths sets I'm making shit up now it's all stupid you know you\n\n01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:29.080\nshould have done five fingers and a big-ass brain what yeah like what up the\n\n01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:36.360\nwhat what what what what figures five fingers up a point up their ass no\n\n01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:42.800\nwhat why would you add up the butt to what me just saying what what is that\n\n01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.000\npainful if I told you how the sixth sense and would you be like what he see\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.360\nthat he's dead up the ass I like why would you just add up you said five\n\n01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:57.640\nfingers and well yeah why and why did you take it there I'm not kink shaming you\n\n01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:02.480\nbut what the fuck dude I'm like making a really salient point I'm just trying to\n\n01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:09.520\nfill time look none of us want to be here I love it anyway the bees yeah so\n\n01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.800\nI'm gonna hear the end of that story he sprays the bees here he sprays the\n\n01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.360\nthing with a like anti-bee pheromone or something he says the bees hate this\n\n01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:22.720\nthey hate this and then he covers it back up and then he takes the bee box\n\n01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.200\ndown to his car but there's bees outside of the bee box kind of hovering\n\n01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.720\naround they're like where's all the bees going you know he puts it into his car\n\n01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.880\nand there's a couple bees that are like trying to get into his car and I'm like\n\n01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:37.480\noh man do bees ever get out in your car and he's like yeah one or two and I'm\n\n01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.760\nlike man that's nuts he's like that's fine it's like that's an occupational\n\n01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.120\nhazardous loose bees in the car and he's just come to terms with it he must\n\n01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.400\nhave been stung a million times and he's just like yeah whatever I asked him\n\n01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.920\nabout that he said like not not too many times he said like I can remember the\n\n01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:57.720\nlast time I stung I got stung well then why is he so chill about a bee in your\n\n01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:02.080\ncar is our definition of an emergency yeah what right does he have to be\n\n01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.280\ndid he say when was the last time he got like who was president like when he\n\n01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:14.680\ngot stung yeah who Obama Obama he got stung when Obama was president yeah first\n\n01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:19.200\nor second term I don't know I didn't ask which term I mean are there is there\n\n01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:25.280\nany end to that guy's fuck ups as a president I know thanks Obama but top of\n\n01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.040\neverything else he got that guy stung and then he said he takes him to his\n\n01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.080\nhouse he has like a property that has where you think he just he's just he's\n\n01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:41.160\nlike a hoarder of bees he just he puts the bees in like a bee apartment they\n\n01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.440\nlove it they're having new friends oh yeah no that's terrible all these bees\n\n01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:50.240\nthat end up in my swimming pool I keep like scooping him out and they're just\n\n01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.880\nlike why do they go in the water they're thirsty I someone told me and I'm like\n\n01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.760\nthat's silly I like what they're bees they could get water anywhere there's\n\n01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.840\ndew drops I don't think living like a that's proof that bees can't tell\n\n01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.280\nstories yeah I was like they wiggle on the pool and then I'll like let them out\n\n01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.120\nI'll put them on a pair I'll take a pair of swim trunks or something I'll go\n\n01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:15.000\nlike scoop I'll put them on the edge of the pool I'll go like there you go you\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.680\ndid it you know you're supposedly like 70% of the food web or something I hope\n\n01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:27.760\nyou do well and then the bees like flying and he's like he gets the he works\n\n01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.480\nit all out and second damn can't believe I fell into a giant vat of chlorinated\n\n01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:38.560\nfucking like water he walks right back with plops on the pool these fucking\n\n01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.280\nthings I'm like I did what I did three rounds with one of them and then I\n\n01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:47.920\nfucking smushed it I was like oh damn you can't I told him I said this is God\n\n01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:53.560\ntalking to you you have done this twice like I cannot allow you to keep walking\n\n01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:58.840\ninto my pool you are self-destructive and I am no stranger to that maybe the\n\n01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:05.080\nchlorine made him he loves it maybe maybe maybe he's up maybe he's right\n\n01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.360\npriorities he's like dude in Hollywood I'm in a pool like what are you trying\n\n01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:17.880\nto do man this is where I wanted to go out you're not in Hollywood damn you\n\n01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.200\nknow they used to call him king bees because they couldn't fathom queen or\n\n01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:26.880\nyou know a woman being in charge all those bees really yeah I think it was\n\n01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.240\nAristotle who's like famous the Roland Emmerich Godzilla movie where they were\n\n01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:38.400\nlike where Godzilla like gave birth to a bunch of baby Godzilla's and and they\n\n01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:44.840\nsaid oh this male must give birth to and it's like just you just say Godzilla's\n\n01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.760\na girl you god damn it why why couldn't Godzilla be well because then YouTube\n\n01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:57.560\nwould have fucking I'm sorry I refuse to review this movie they didn't mind\n\n01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:04.400\nGodzilla into a prancing ballerina but they had they said well we this one's\n\n01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:10.360\nnot a girl yeah it was like a story point where they kept like saying well\n\n01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:15.320\nit's strange because usually the male does doesn't give birth it's usually the\n\n01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:23.120\nthe other whoa I mean like right in the name did you do you remember when we\n\n01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:31.280\nmet with those guys yes when they wanted to do Godzilla to yeah I'm older than\n\n01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:37.520\nboth of them now we met with those guys yeah we got that was that was another\n\n01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.440\ncareer non-changer because we pissed them off like I don't think they pissed them\n\n01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:47.000\noff but I think I think nobody wanted no version of a sequel no well they good\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.520\nbut they we could have come out of that meeting with those guys going like this\n\n01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.800\nis Harmon and Schrab guys like they're cool like but we insulted them on accident\n\n01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:02.000\noh how did you remember how because we we said we were we were movie was a piece\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nwe were we were talking about the giant robot movie that we were writing at the\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.720\ntime and we were like like we were like yeah no it's gonna it's not not not like\n\n01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.400\nyour movie it's gonna be like just like old-school like guys in suits and then\n\n01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:21.320\nthey're there and Roland Emmerich was like I remember him as smoking with his\n\n01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.080\nlike like holding a cigarette like this but I don't know if he was actually\n\n01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.560\ndoing it he's so German that I was like just remember him like that's like what\n\n01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:33.640\nif you took put a dog's head on a Jews body the didn't say that he didn't say\n\n01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:40.640\nthat he didn't know he did not say that he said Jewish he said Jewish he was very\n\n01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.040\ntasteful about it the the no but it just picture I'm sure he wasn't smoking cuz\n\n01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.160\nit was like we were in the world well it was his I mean he owned fucking he was\n\n01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:55.520\nColumbia where it was like it was like like it anyways but yeah he and that\n\n01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.520\nbecause remember they kind of blanched when we said we mentioned guys in suits\n\n01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:06.440\nand then they said they said like God's Dean Devlin said Godzilla was a guy in a\n\n01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:11.880\nsuit like they're Godzilla and you said yeah motion control suit and we kind of\n\n01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:17.320\nlike we were just sort of like why are we bullying them but we didn't mean to but\n\n01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.480\nI just think I don't think we hit it off came out of the gate saying well what we\n\n01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.600\nwanted to do is take something really dumb and yeah cool that was like that\n\n01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.800\nwas ever excited he said like you watch those old Godzilla movies and it's so\n\n01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.480\ncheesy we just want to make it less cheesy and you you know you wanted to\n\n01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:36.280\nmurder him yeah I would fucking kick him in but you don't regret that right no not\n\n01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:40.600\nat all great so like like so that's a good example of like like so you're\n\n01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.160\ngoing through some woes right now like what's the real voice the voice inside\n\n01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.200\nyour head don't you think that's thematically connected where it's like\n\n01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:50.160\nyou know you're like when am I gonna get a break like wait or like what you know\n\n01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.760\nit's like you don't want to be on the wrong side of your own personal history\n\n01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.920\nyou're you're you're a creative guy that has answers to a higher calling like the\n\n01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:02.960\nreason for your current woes are precisely because you give too much of a\n\n01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.360\nfuck not too much like pejoratively speaking like you you give too much of a\n\n01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:13.320\nfuck for them in like it's problematic for them that you give so much of a fuck\n\n01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.280\nthat you're like don't you why do you want your thing to be shitty and they're\n\n01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:20.120\nlike fuck you like kind of thing whatever like it happens to be a million I\n\n01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:27.360\nmean like whatever like I at the end of your life you're gonna you're gonna be\n\n01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:33.800\nlike God thank God like like what's the alternative to that like it's called\n\n01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.800\nselling out like I don't want to be like Tyler Durton about it where it's like\n\n01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:43.800\ngood I think there's a there's just as much joy to doing what people want you\n\n01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:50.040\nto do but yeah you know you're cool everybody likes you like fucking fuck\n\n01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:58.120\noff you didn't fuck off you guys know about counter transference yes okay\n\n01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:04.280\nmoving on now what is it what is counter transfer it's when a therapist is\n\n01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:11.040\nis like projecting their own situation on to the client situation I think my\n\n01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:17.280\ntherapist is doing that a lot oh no this could be bad uh no unless he thinks\n\n01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.880\nthat I'd look a lot like him with a haircut and like he's thinking of a\n\n01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.600\ntime where he had super long hair and then he he got his hair cut and then\n\n01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.440\nlike someone give him a therapist degree or something it just but it could be in\n\n01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:33.840\nthat example that your therapist is like transferring like some kind of like\n\n01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.840\nweird insecurity about their anything right whether it's physical or not but\n\n01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.000\nthere and then they're like why don't you just fucking get a haircut you know\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.400\nthat they're like how is that going by the way I haven't been he's had a thing\n\n01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:50.200\nI've had a thing we've had some things no but when when he brought up the hair\n\n01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:55.880\ncut for like the billionth time or whatever I was like I was like do you\n\n01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:00.840\ngo out do you think that like if I went to another therapist they would say\n\n01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.600\nstuff like this or do you think that's just you and he was like well there's\n\n01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:09.840\nthis thing called counter transference and I'm like okay what the fuck are you\n\n01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:17.880\nout of your fucking mind our next guest this is gold over here you know the\n\n01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:24.480\nclosest thing I'll ever have to a son you're gonna have kids right look I'm\n\n01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:30.280\nnot gonna kids I can't even get up out of this chair I I don't want to cast a\n\n01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.640\nvalue judgment I just thought that was an intention that was happening now I'm\n\n01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.360\nlike Cody makes the world go around if she wants kids there's gonna be kids but\n\n01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.760\nlike she's not sure right unless I get distracted by that I want my dog to live\n\n01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:48.440\nforever or at least you can clone your dog clone your dog not the same thing it\n\n01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.080\nwill be I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to clone my dog clone your\n\n01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.360\ndog before it dies and then they can be friends there's too many dogs out there\n\n01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:02.040\nthat need homes and I'd rather rather give another home but I do both I just\n\n01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:11.320\nwould rather that I die before you could I gotta range that let's talk I used to\n\n01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.600\ntweet stuff like that and then Courtney Love would text somebody like you're\n\n01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:27.200\nsounding like you don't alarm let the kids know that I like you that way that's\n\n01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:34.240\npossible like happy people are boring it's a flavor it's like black licorice\n\n01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:43.040\nit's yummy life is darkness it's it but it's fun it's like you get your health\n\n01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:48.040\nand and God is a weirdo it's easy for you people listen to you\n\n01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:54.080\npeople listen to you yeah and it's not making me any happier you got to do a\n\n01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.960\npodcast job haven't your own podcast yeah I don't have anything to say the\n\n01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:06.200\nSchrabcast all I've done is rack up a bunch more stories like you have where\n\n01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:09.920\nI'm like and it's my own doing because people listen to me what you mean is like\n\n01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:14.800\noh I don't get fired I I fuck up and I quit or whatever it's like that's the\n\n01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:23.760\nonly difference like it I it it's like I just do is like the more permission I\n\n01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.640\nget to like tell people what to do the more I let them down you should be like\n\n01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:34.480\nexcited about like your dilemma why am I telling you how to feel I like like\n\n01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:40.920\nyou're living the dream little piece of shit I think that a lot of people myself\n\n01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:46.600\nincluded think about their their life in terms of I'm too old for it to happen\n\n01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.720\nlike everyone thinks that you know what to happen to play cards against\n\n01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.280\nhumanity like what's what is our dream like I yeah I'll tell you swimming pool\n\n01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:03.120\nturns out to be pretty fun but all right so this transference thing the therapist\n\n01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:09.240\nlike I like this like you you you pull the real fucking what have I done no and\n\n01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:15.600\nI was a fucking like that was a very dare I say like me move on a therapist like\n\n01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.880\nthat where you were like hey you think if I see another they would talk this much\n\n01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:24.960\nshit like like like asking them questions about their profession and then\n\n01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.480\nthe guy was like forced to open the hood and go like oh well there's this thing\n\n01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.160\ncalled transference I bet you fucked him up real good well yeah I mean that's the\n\n01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.440\nthing is cuz like there was I was not making eye contact with him because I\n\n01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:40.520\ndon't because because he asked you to once he asked me to and also he just\n\n01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.680\ndoesn't look great I don't want to look at that yeah you want to hear his soul\n\n01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:48.200\ncry yeah but I just mostly don't like that also I just don't want I want I\n\n01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.920\ndon't want to think about looking about like I want to think about what I'm\n\n01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.120\nthinking about anyway but I have no problem looking at you while you're\n\n01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.160\nsaying this because you're not looking at me and I like looking at you because\n\n01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.000\nyou're great to look at especially because you're not looking at tell that to\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:08.280\nany woman doctor fuck yeah dr. fuckface no it's true but so I and then I asked\n\n01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:12.160\nhim that I was like is that and then I was making the most direct eye contact\n\n01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:18.480\nI was like I am gonna eat you right now and I'm sure he loved that that's what\n\n01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.720\nhe was wanting the whole time I had I had a threshold with my therapist once\n\n01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.920\nwhere I was I told her I don't know how it came up in context but I was\n\n01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:33.320\nexplaining to her I told there's a story that I've told up here at least once if\n\n01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:38.560\nnot twice or more we just give it then the thing that I had a therapist who I\n\n01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.680\nstopped seeing because she was crying while I was talking to her about my\n\n01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.760\nchildhood but it wasn't really talking about like cry worthy stuff but my\n\n01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.400\nchildhood was more like here's my favorite book or something and then she\n\n01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.000\nwas like crying and I was like why are you crying and she was like it's very\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.240\nemotional stuff and I was like no it's not and then at the end of the session\n\n01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.840\nshe was like I feel really conflicted about this I'm really humiliated but\n\n01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:03.800\nyou called me out on the tears before I had some eye work done recently and my\n\n01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.720\neyes are watering and then my instinct when you asked me why my eyes were\n\n01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:14.200\nwatering was to lie and I was like I thought in my head like that's fine to\n\n01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.520\nmake that mistake and then to come clean about it it's and if you were my\n\n01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:26.960\nmechanic it would be fine to lie about it and blame me or like but my therapist\n\n01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:30.920\nI think it's kind of a day I just never went back and I'm sure she wasn't shocked\n\n01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:36.080\nand I hope she never thought oh I shouldn't have been honest I hope she\n\n01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:40.360\ngot the the other message was I shouldn't have been dishonest right but\n\n01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:46.480\nanyways but but the I was telling that story to my current therapist and my\n\n01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:51.040\ncurrent therapist kind of was like she basically was sort of like why are you\n\n01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:57.000\ntelling me this story and I was like I don't know because we were talking about\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.640\nthis one thing and she was like are you maybe letting me know that you're like a\n\n01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:08.800\npower user like of therapy and like I shouldn't fuck around because and she\n\n01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:13.520\nsaid she sort of had a way of expressing she was kind of like like she\n\n01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.200\ndidn't she didn't counter it wasn't like a she but she I get the message from her\n\n01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.720\nthat it was like because that would be a fucked up environment in which I would\n\n01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.920\nhave to work kind of and like she she humanized herself it was sort of like\n\n01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:31.200\nlike like she said what I would say maybe if I was a therapist and someone was\n\n01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:36.360\nlike well one therapist one time they fucked up but not cut him loose and that\n\n01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.120\nI guess I would I would say to that patient I would go like well if what\n\n01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:43.560\nyou're saying to me is that this is a fucking minefield like I'm probably not\n\n01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:48.480\ngonna get any quality work done like sweating and like worried that I'm gonna\n\n01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.480\ncut the blue wire into the red wire and she kind of and it was it was a big\n\n01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.200\nthreshold for us like among many where I was like oh man she like I trusted her\n\n01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:03.720\nmore after that and I think the moral of that story is is both that yeah bad\n\n01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:09.560\ntherapists suck and should be cut loose and good therapists you know them when\n\n01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:13.400\nyou got them because I was able to tell that story to her and instead of her\n\n01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:20.000\nbeing like what a shitty therapist holler at your girl she was like like it's\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.840\nnotable that you're telling me that story and like it was it was a pathway for\n\n01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.320\nus to deepen our relationship and for her to be able to help me even more\n\n01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.600\nbecause I was able to open even more gateways to her because she earned it\n\n01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:36.640\nby reacting like a human being to that story and communicating her own\n\n01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.840\nvulnerabilities and stuff and I and so not that you asked for advice or anything\n\n01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:46.080\nand you you already know this but like yeah like you definitely have like the\n\n01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.920\ngreen light to cut this piece of he's not a piece of shit he might be a\n\n01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:53.400\nwonderful therapist he's yeah he's like not compatible with you the thing yeah\n\n01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.240\nwe were talking about that and he was like well you seem to have a lot of you\n\n01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:02.620\nknow what do you call it like weight put on your looks or you feel like your\n\n01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:06.320\nappearances messed up and it's like well I feel like that because when I'm at the\n\n01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.640\nstore I'm like looking at cereal and then like a kid runs by and then like a\n\n01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:16.800\nmom clutches the kid close and glares at me as they walk off together like I was\n\n01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.920\ngonna like just reach out and start like molesting that child or something not\n\n01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:26.640\neven making eye contact and when you're the Van Halen of molestation and when\n\n01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.320\nthat happens to you enough times you're like wow people must really think I'm\n\n01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:36.440\nlike a living monster nobody thinks you're a living certainly the parents who\n\n01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:41.880\ndo that to me do they they're then that's their problem yeah no I agree that's\n\n01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:45.960\ntheir problem it's just traumatizing you're brought you don't look like a\n\n01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:50.840\nmonster I do to these people come on at one time I was leaving Dan's house in\n\n01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:54.600\nthe middle of the night and just as things what yeah not in the middle of\n\n01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.120\nnight sorry it was like at a party or something it was a while back but I was\n\n01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.600\nlike leaving your house and I was getting on to the sidewalk and someone was\n\n01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.840\njogging by like right at the same time and it wasn't like I stepped out in front\n\n01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:11.280\nof them I we kind of just kind of stepped out in roughly the same space and\n\n01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.560\nshe like screamed and I was like I'm I guess I'm just an ogre like that's I'm\n\n01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:21.680\nlike Frankenstein I think I think she probably you startled her I did with my\n\n01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.960\nappearance but I mean having said weren't you terrified that she ran by I\n\n01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.400\nmean like I was terrified that that's the effect I have on people and then I\n\n01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.960\nwas like yeah I know this all tracks I've walked out of that gate with and it's\n\n01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.460\nlike it's the physical there's no line of sight\n\n01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:41.280\nsituation of it is like so every once in a while like boom somebody like runs by\n\n01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:47.400\nor walks by with their dog I fucking freak I'm yelp yeah well but yeah but\n\n01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:51.360\nwhat if those people because they were ugly or monstrous they would be so\n\n01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:57.360\nwrong I was like there was a physical body like coming by me oh from the stool\n\n01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:04.520\nasses fell asleep I Jesus Christ this couch isn't bad is Jeff still here I\n\n01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:09.600\nthink he left it doesn't I mean shoes that's a good point he can't really get\n\n01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:14.360\ntoo far without that stuff he has his phone though\n\n01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:17.680\nwhy don't we why don't we why don't we why don't we make a new friend we haven't\n\n01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:24.960\ndone that in a long time who's somebody that how do we what do we do we can't\n\n01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:31.440\njust base it on who wants to be on stage those are horrible people but\n\n01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:34.640\ninevitably that's what you're picking you know right it's not like if I say\n\n01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.280\nwho's allergic to clovers and someone who doesn't want to be on stage and is\n\n01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:42.600\nrichly allergic to clovers they're gonna not raise their hand right they're\n\n01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:48.600\ngonna they're critical thinkers and now they have to be people who are willing\n\n01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:52.320\nto raise their hand after being potentially called out as people who\n\n01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.120\nwant to be on stage so that's already gonna be like more fucked up people well\n\n01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.960\nI think I well maybe I'm deluded about this but I think that me doing that kind\n\n01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:04.720\nof actually eases the like like me calling attention to it like means that\n\n01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.560\nif they raise their hand then it's like now they've thought about it and the\n\n01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.440\naudience is like who's this piece of shit they can watch to be on stage it's\n\n01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:14.600\nlike I already talked about it like they're aware of the fury are you doing\n\n01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:19.200\nany new music are you doing any music new music I hit like this thing I'm\n\n01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:24.920\ntrying to mic my car I got I got I got I got fucked up like neurological problems\n\n01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:30.200\nman like I get into something that makes me happy and then I fucking like I\n\n01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.800\njust like I'm like oh I gotta okay I get it I gotta make my car right like like\n\n01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:38.800\nso that I can do little raps that we're making everyone happy and making me\n\n01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.160\nhappy and I'm like like somewhere in there I just like I just I ordered like a\n\n01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.960\nmillion dollars worth of fucking shit that didn't work and then I was like I\n\n01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:50.720\ndon't know what it is with me I got my own I got I got fucked up shit in my\n\n01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:55.880\nbrain you know like that's gonna suck you know like that started I started\n\n01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:59.560\nplaying cookie collector that's when you know I'm really fucked up like I like\n\n01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:04.200\nthere's a couple of fans that are like on my cookie collector team which is\n\n01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:09.560\ncalled Jerry Burry and they like you they're like oh shit Harmon's back and\n\n01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.760\nI'm like I know what that looks they know that I'm like in some kind of\n\n01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.720\ndepressive state because it's like I'm all of them I'm collecting like 30\n\n01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:21.200\nbillion cookies guys got two houses where you gotta be I know it's all it's\n\n01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.600\njust it's just bio rhythms I think it's just like a sine wave it just I'm not\n\n01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.680\neven depressed it's just sort of like all of a sudden your expression of\n\n01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:30.600\nhappiness becomes something else like all of them are just collecting cookies I\n\n01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.920\ndon't know why am I not making the thing like I was like learning software and\n\n01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:44.840\nwhat am I doing knows I'm a collecting cookies I don't get it yeah well we can't\n\n01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:50.880\nwe can't we can't call anybody up that that that we all we talked about was\n\n01:23:50.880 --> 01:24:02.000\nbagel boss guy that almost sounds like battle bots Polish well there's nobody\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.480\nhere that's like like like that knows about skin tags and Polish moles kind of\n\n01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:13.480\nthing is there not the cancer mind can you shout out you your expertise so you\n\n01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:20.760\ncovered in them or are you a dermatologist or holy shit would you like to\n\n01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:25.000\ncome up here and if we if we force you to and you have the excuse that we force\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.680\nyou to and everyone knows you're a good person or you're not you you're not just\n\n01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:43.600\nyeah I know I'll see you then now everyone will love you yeah come on up what's your name hello Jeff Jack Jack\n\n01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:49.840\nhow do you become a researcher Jack Jack Jack Jack I just remember you're\n\n01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:53.800\nwearing a jacket who are the guys that who are the guys that walk past me on\n\n01:24:53.800 --> 01:25:00.160\nthe Jesus fucking Christ you're gonna knock over the Jeff golem this fucking\n\n01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:05.720\nshow I just every week I want to quit and then I give it one more chance and\n\n01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:10.200\nthen Schrab who are the guys I walk past on the sidewalk when I was coming in\n\n01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:17.440\nwith you guys here okay yeah you didn't take that the really like I I felt like\n\n01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.000\nI accidentally offended you guys okay because I did a thing it was like kind\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.960\nof like when I for the first time I met Seth Rogen it was like we were walking\n\n01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:32.400\non a on a on the on a lot of some kind and there was someone I was with that\n\n01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:39.400\nlike knew Seth Rogen and he was like hey Seth it's me so-and-so or whatever and\n\n01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:44.320\nand Seth Rogen had the it was like had this like Seth Rogen chuckle but I was\n\n01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.160\nlike well yeah I knew you when I saw you guys walking toward me I was like well\n\n01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.880\nthese guys are probably fans of mine so like I like it was like and it was kind\n\n01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.920\nof an endearing thing and it was kind of like in the moment I was sort of like\n\n01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.520\nbecause I saw you guys coming and then you were like smirking at me because\n\n01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:02.320\nyou were walking past me and then I had a moment to think about it and then you\n\n01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.680\nguys were like we're coming to see your show and I blurted something like yeah\n\n01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:15.280\nwell you look like it or something it was a and I'm I really didn't I'm not\n\n01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:23.320\ngood at talking welcome Jack okay a researcher you have to do science yeah\n\n01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:29.160\nI got in it after college I was I studied organic chemistry in college right\n\n01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:33.200\nI was working as an organic chemist in a research lab and then I got hired and\n\n01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:46.280\nyeah that's cool so like all right so what do you know about this maybe you\n\n01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:51.600\nshould touch it that's an either of us want that no no no just like give it a\n\n01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.960\nlittle twiddle just so you can let it I'll touch it if you want me to touch it\n\n01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:04.680\nI'm not concerned about it or worried about I think you should touch it right\n\n01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:08.880\nit's entertaining to the people no it's doesn't that's not important it's a\n\n01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:15.080\ndead what okay they have a normal life cycle they grow and they fall off\n\n01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:21.040\ngenerally what are they on a cellular level they're just epithelial fish you\n\n01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.800\nbut like in terms of like is it is it related to cancer like is it a phenomenon\n\n01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:30.600\nlike cancer but it's just like not yeah so they're called like a nevis which is\n\n01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:36.520\nlike a form for skin lesion and which is just another word for a mole or\n\n01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.760\nsomething like that they're not technically a how come some cells can go\n\n01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.600\ncrazy and start just making more of themselves and you get like the\n\n01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:49.320\na blemish like a mole or a skin tag or and like how come how come how come\n\n01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:53.280\nsometimes that's just like a thing that's contained and just like falls off or\n\n01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:59.880\nisn't isn't worrisome and then what what why is that why isn't it a zero-sum\n\n01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.200\ngame if a cell has lost its mind and is just making more of itself like why why\n\n01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.640\ndo some of them just stop and make a mole and some of them become a tumor that\n\n01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.200\nkills you so it turns out that like mutations are required to make cancer\n\n01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.800\nand mutations happen all the time they happen every time your skin cells get\n\n01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:25.280\nhit with sunlight they happen every time you interact with toxic chemicals and a\n\n01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.480\nlot of those mutations are harmless and in fact it takes sometimes hundreds of\n\n01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:35.760\nmutations or or thousands of mutations to make something into a cancer and what\n\n01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:40.040\nyou almost sound like you're saying that the things that that are benign that\n\n01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:44.600\ngrow on the surface of our skin that those aren't the result of mutations they\n\n01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:50.600\ncan definitely be the result of mutations there's a genetic component to\n\n01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:56.600\nthings that grow on your skin Nevi as they're called or moles or skin tags and\n\n01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:02.280\nthe genetic component so some people especially white people have up to\n\n01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:08.600\nhundreds of moles on their body and some people don't have very many at all\n\n01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:17.000\nI'm also one of those people the most harmless form of white supremacy I've\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.920\never heard I never I never knew I could get behind any form of white\n\n01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:33.160\nsupremacy until a guy like whoo to skin tags being prevalent yeah oh wow I mean\n\n01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:38.200\ngosh yeah I feel like like thank you but you're like a dream like wait I want\n\n01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:41.200\nto plug your album or something I mean you're like you're you're you're being\n\n01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:46.880\nso like like fucking straightforward so I call you're so anti-Schrab do you see\n\n01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:54.160\nChernobyl I haven't seen Chernobyl oh is it a nightmare for you yeah yeah I know\n\n01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:58.600\nexactly what's happening to that guy's face yeah yeah you should watch Chernobyl\n\n01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:04.000\nit's really it's really people are really liking it oh they're thinking it's\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:11.280\ngreat you should watch Chernobyl did do you have already Chernobyl do you have\n\n01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:18.200\nChernobyl at home do you have it at home I grew up with Chernobyl right right\n\n01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:23.680\nright it happened to all of us did it what kind of a life span did it happen\n\n01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:26.480\ndid it fall off\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.400\nlong okay so important question ignore me so that so when one of these things is\n\n01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:38.640\ngrowing on our eyelids or arms dangling off and like so what about this like\n\n01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:42.800\nscience that I've had programmed into me it was like I'm not supposed to do\n\n01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:46.320\nanything to this I've heard people tell anecdotes about I went to my general\n\n01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:51.480\ndoctor he brought out a scalpel and sliced it right off after I worried about\n\n01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:55.600\nit for six months he's like who gives a shit and then other people go don't touch\n\n01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:01.320\nit don't fuck with it like if you pull it off it'll it's like it becomes cancer\n\n01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:07.500\nis there any truth or reasoning vast majority will not become cancer is there\n\n01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:13.720\nany reason why people would think that there's I mean with every so one part\n\n01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:18.360\nof a possible life cycle of an Evis is to accumulate enough mutations to become\n\n01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:25.400\ncancer and whether you and so maybe pulling it off is simply encouraging\n\n01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:30.720\nit to grow more like pruning a tree in which case if it was gonna eventually\n\n01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:35.320\nbecome cancer you're just giving it a kind of a boost so the worry with cancer\n\n01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:39.000\nisn't so much that it's gonna grow it's that it's gonna metastasize it's gonna\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.520\nspread your other tissues and it's gonna cause them to shut down especially your\n\n01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:46.080\nmajor organs wait what's the say that again cuz that's the definition of a\n\n01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:51.480\nreally important cancer so metastasize means it say that again yeah so the the\n\n01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:55.960\nthe worry with cancer is that it's going to become metastatic it's gonna be able\n\n01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:59.600\nto move through things like your bloodstream or your lymph into other\n\n01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:04.520\ntissues not that well so so cancer can't just kill you by just like like I'm a\n\n01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.760\nlittle piece of bone that decided it's not a bone I'm gonna grow into a big\n\n01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:12.080\nball of bone the problem is that it actually spreads to like lymph nodes and\n\n01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.640\nwhatever I want to kind of add the disclaimer that I'm answer this question\n\n01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:20.920\nto the best of my ability but I'm also not a doctor I'm just you also said you\n\n01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:24.360\nalso said excuse me then you also said you weren't a good person explain\n\n01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:30.800\nyourself I guess I'm on stage so in some in some way yeah I wanted to be here\n\n01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:33.440\nand I don't know that I guess that doesn't make me a good person or a bad\n\n01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:40.000\nperson I mean wow yeah it's a casted paradox you're it's a Taoist principle\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.560\nlike like if you thought you were a good person you'd be a shitty person you\n\n01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.680\ngotta think you're a bad person that's your only recourse to being a good\n\n01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:55.000\nperson yeah yeah yeah yeah and I went shut yeah are there some of the people\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.200\nwho are watching through subscription we're seeing your face are probably\n\n01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:03.640\nwondering like dermatology research are you like cheating like do you like there\n\n01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:07.280\nthere are stringents at the office and things like because you have very nice\n\n01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:13.520\nskin and I'm not hitting on you but like you're I thank you I actually it's one\n\n01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:17.560\nthing I'm self-conscious about is my skin which is weird maybe to hear you\n\n01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:22.760\nsay that what are you worried about I don't know I I mean you're very handsome\n\n01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:31.640\nstop it stop it stop it everyone under 40 by the way is just wonderful looking\n\n01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:38.160\nto me now I just look and I see everyone is like non piles of bones and I go\n\n01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:53.600\nhubba hubba to answer your original question what is what's your favorite\n\n01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:59.840\nkind of let him answer let me I want to know what let him answer son let him\n\n01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:06.080\nanswer sunburns you couldn't come into the laboratory with a sunburn that would\n\n01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:10.040\nbe you would yeah my boss would tear my head off if I came in with a sunburn oh\n\n01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.640\nlike well okay well tell me a little bit about that because I'm very like very\n\n01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:21.760\nvery cockazoid like guy that just got a pool and like I'm I got a lot of British\n\n01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:29.600\nDNA and I'm like I turned pink fast I peel fast like I like what I don't\n\n01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:34.160\nunderstand sunscreen I don't understand I don't even know what to ask you I wish\n\n01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.240\nyou could just tell me something to make me not worry because I feel like I people\n\n01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:41.400\nare always telling me put on sunscreen definitely tell you something to make you\n\n01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:47.360\nnot worry okay what I don't know that'd be true you should definitely worry oh\n\n01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:56.440\nyeah I like that honestly you're saying I could lie to you yeah but you all right\n\n01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.920\ndon't I don't want you to I think the coolest thing about sun tanning actually\n\n01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:06.960\nis that is my favorite fact about skin really is that sunlight yeah I guess I'm\n\n01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:13.360\na nerd sunlight in order to tan you actually have to damage the DNA tanning\n\n01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:18.000\nis a direct response to like getting DNA damage sunlight actually comes in and\n\n01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.400\nit mutates or destroys parts of your DNA and then your cells respond by wow\n\n01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.760\nproducing pigment and they produce these little shields like in your skin\n\n01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:32.880\nmelanoma melanin melanin actually produces a little shield like if you look\n\n01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.120\nat a skin cell under a microscope it'll be there'll be like a little shield of\n\n01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:42.120\nmelanin over the nucleus right where the DNA is so melanin is what it's like I\n\n01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:47.200\nthink you just told me but it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a\n\n01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:51.440\ncoating around a cell membrane it's a pigment so it's like a small molecule as\n\n01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:58.560\nopposed to like protein or something is it itself it's not it's I'm trying to\n\n01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.600\npicture like like remember in high school they showed us like a cross section of\n\n01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:06.400\nskin and it's like okay there's like all these layers so like is melanin like a\n\n01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:10.760\nchemical that exists somewhere in one of those layers that like oh man this is a\n\n01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:18.160\nlot gonna be a lot of science so melanin is produced in the melanocytes is a\n\n01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.920\nspecial type of cell specifically for producing melanin and totally a special\n\n01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:31.200\ncell yeah it's in the basal layer of the skin so the skin has like a lot of other\n\n01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.960\ntypes of cells in it one of them is the melanocytes they have these like\n\n01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:41.040\nspecial little tendrils that are like pumping out melanin pumping out melanin\n\n01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:44.480\nand they actually like ship it off to all your other cells and give it to the\n\n01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:48.160\ncells so that the cells can protect themselves and the cells coat themselves\n\n01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.400\nin it no they just produce like a protective shield over the nucleus just\n\n01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:57.960\nthe nucleus nucleus oh wow yeah which is pretty cool that's my favorite that is\n\n01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:06.320\ncool I thought so god damn I love fucking biology I yeah and so and so and so\n\n01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:12.400\nour emphasis on like pigmentation with the as we you know eight billion of us\n\n01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.280\nare all like mad at each other we're looking at each other on Facebook and\n\n01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:18.280\nwe're like recognizing each other as being from different parts of the world\n\n01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:22.160\nand things like all of it really comes down to like these shades and things and\n\n01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:28.280\nso the melanin is like a so there's like if you're if your genetic heritage\n\n01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:32.440\ncomes from a part where there's this being beaten by the Sun then then those\n\n01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:48.640\nmelanites I'm going to make you olive complexion they're just they're just\n\n01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:52.600\npumping out different degrees of sunscreen like which probably comes at a\n\n01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:58.240\nmetabolic cost right that's correct actually both those things yeah and so\n\n01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:05.800\nand so white white people are at much higher risk of skin cancer than people\n\n01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:10.240\nthat have like more melanin like black I guess it's just natural suns that it's\n\n01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:16.560\nput like because your nucleus is exposed to the Sun yes although anyone can get\n\n01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:20.440\nskin cancer right right right not to say yeah I'm not telling anyone to go\n\n01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:29.120\nwhat about Brad say again what about Brad just a friend of yours that yeah can\n\n01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.080\nhe get skin cancer how does he ever go in the Sun\n\n01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:39.120\nwell yeah he's Brad oh I kind of wondering yeah like Brad it's like\n\n01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:44.360\nthese mutants like so like this the thing that's hanging off of my arm which\n\n01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:48.680\nmay or may not fall off it'll pick its own time but it's it's so it's an\n\n01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.360\nexpression of my genetic code as a person that's descended from East\n\n01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.360\nEuropeans and British people and it's like it's a part of my skin that's\n\n01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:00.520\ngoing like oh this is a good place for like a random fucking quato like just\n\n01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:04.600\nlike blossom off and it's like it even though it's not mutation based it is\n\n01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:08.120\nlong-term mutation based in the sense that parents are shuffling their genes\n\n01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:12.280\nevery time they make a baby and then we're all carrying over these like weird\n\n01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.280\nrandom experiments in our DNA and some of those experiments will say like this\n\n01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:18.560\nperson should have this color eyes or this person should have like this\n\n01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:23.560\ndorsal fin or gills or something that like might come in handy but like my DNA\n\n01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:28.120\nis includes all this like static that's like and by the way have a little like\n\n01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:35.120\nporcupine come off of his arm when he's 46 and like it it's it has in its own way\n\n01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:39.800\nit's a function it's an it would only have a function if it was in the sense\n\n01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:47.280\nof emergence if over time wouldn't it ultimately it could lead to if there was\n\n01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:53.120\na chance that having that thing on my arm led to my DNA like if everyone\n\n01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:57.960\nfound that incredibly hot and and not having a thing dangling off your arm\n\n01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:02.880\nwas like gross get him away from me and then and then wouldn't with this past\n\n01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:12.560\nto my children like growing it on the same spot on my arm no okay yeah you're\n\n01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.320\nasking basically is there a selection pressure an evolutionary selection\n\n01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:21.840\npressure on things like skin tags exactly what I'm also asking like to the\n\n01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:27.160\nextent that it's a it's a it's a it's a function of my DNA is it is it is it\n\n01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:33.720\nyes hereditary but it's hereditary to have them but location wise your there's\n\n01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:38.640\nprobably predisposed places on people's bodies where they're more likely to\n\n01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:43.360\noccur just like if your mom and dad both have one on their eyelid when they're\n\n01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:48.400\n25 and both of them grow and fall off but and then they have a kid together is\n\n01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:53.560\nthat kid more likely to have a skin tag on their eyelid or just more likely to\n\n01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:57.440\nhave skin tags I'm definitely not qualified to answer that question but\n\n01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:02.240\ndoubtful all right well Jesus Christ what a fucking podcast well if you're so\n\n01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:08.000\nsmart you tell us about the Jewish golem what do you know about the Jewish\n\n01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:18.560\ngolem what kind of magic I can probably confirm that it's not skin tag magic\n\n01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.640\nright and our skin related magic thank you do you live here in LA are you\n\n01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.080\nvisiting I'm visiting oh who you visit or well tell me tell me when I'm\n\n01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:44.480\nprying your sister that's the wholesome thank you stop hitting on him is she of\n\n01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:52.720\nmarriageable age does she have a brother I was gonna say is she is she is she an\n\n01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:55.480\nolder sister a kid sister and then I was like I don't even know how old you are\n\n01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.240\nand then I was like can you ask anyone's age anymore I guess I always want to know\n\n01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:07.120\nhow old everyone is 28 so she your kid sister no she's older than I am she's\n\n01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:17.920\n30 and is she here no she's not what a nice family you're you visit your\n\n01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:24.840\nsister yeah what's it like to yeah yeah what's it yeah what I like where are you\n\n01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:29.560\nfrom originally I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area okay not that much of\n\n01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:36.760\na track I heard a upe we got a upe and are you you you sound like you\n\n01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:41.720\ncycled into this dermatological research part of your organic chemistry like\n\n01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:48.680\nare you do you have do you have dreams that overflow that cup you like you you\n\n01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.600\nended up there are you happy there or is there no actually I feel like I'm kind\n\n01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.040\nof in Schrab position where I'm kind of like what the fuck I don't know what the\n\n01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:01.280\nfuck you've hit a crossroads you're like what are you you're fucking lucky man so\n\n01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:06.880\nyou're basically 28 year old dude with flawless skin are you happy now you're\n\n01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:15.400\nin the same fucking boat so stop fucking doing what we used to call bitchin\n\n01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:27.760\nbefore the me too movement okay well don't repeat it have you been me too not\n\n01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:36.440\nno it's it's like a chemical peel it's amazing it just leaves you like it's\n\n01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:45.240\nlike it hurts at first but then it's like oh my god it sounds uncomfortable yeah\n\n01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:59.560\nwell you should see the other guy all right what's that let's do okay you know\n\n01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:12.120\nhow we let's so so we're gonna do a little game here at Jack and it's called\n\n01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:19.040\nit's called it's called life crossroads it's an improv game that Rob Schrab and\n\n01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:25.300\nI do where we we take you back to a point in your life where you you're\n\n01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:31.360\nwondering like in like you're thinking like what if I had chosen this instead\n\n01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:37.080\nof that can you conjure that moment in your head like like and what we will do\n\n01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:42.640\nis revisit that moment sounds like a terrible idea so like the things would\n\n01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:48.040\nbe dermatology or anything else sure or like anything you could also go back to\n\n01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:52.160\neight years old and be like what if I had taken piano I like whatever you think\n\n01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:57.720\nis like a really like crucial branch in your life or you're like I really wish\n\n01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:02.480\nI could know at least and check in on who I would have been if I had done this\n\n01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:09.560\ninstead of that I know there's a lot of pressure and I can give you a couple\n\n01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:14.160\nminutes to order I think I don't know what I would have done differently at one\n\n01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:17.440\npoint I wanted to be an engineer I don't think that's significantly different\n\n01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:24.440\nfrom like a research scientist but I don't think I'm right it's a choo-choo\n\n01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:29.840\ntrain yeah so different I wouldn't want if I was on a train I wouldn't want the\n\n01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:38.480\nguy making it go choo-choo to know a lot about skin okay that's a good point see\n\n01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:50.920\ndad humor it's fun I think that crossroads is like right now in my life\n\n01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:59.840\nright okay I think I can look back in 10 years so tell us tell us like a kind\n\n01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:05.360\nof dilemma you have if you don't mind of like like what's like a radical decision\n\n01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:10.440\nthat you think is on the table that you you're because you're a logical guy and\n\n01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:15.000\nyou're like oh I would never maybe do that but like like I would never do stand\n\n01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.600\nup but like at this point in my life I'd be I would like think about putting\n\n01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:22.440\nmyself in that position so I'm being on stage here is like one of those things\n\n01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:26.760\nwhere I'm kind of like well do something I'm uncomfortable with so we should show\n\n01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.920\nyou then what your life would be like if you okay all right you hear that\n\n01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:48.080\nSchrab okay so here we go so enjoy what if Jack had done stand up instead of\n\n01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:57.160\ndermatological research okay welcome to the comedy hut tonight on the comedy\n\n01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:02.800\nhut okay come on people keep it going this ain't easy Ellen DeGeneres Chris\n\n01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:13.720\nRock my name is Ellen DeGeneres and Jack what apparently somebody's on stage I\n\n01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:21.520\nduring the intro let's give it up for Ellen DeGeneres who just said Ellen\n\n01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:29.200\nDeGeneres here we go yeah it's okay put your hands together here's Ellen De\n\n01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:42.840\nGenerous my name is Ellen DeGeneres hi Ellen I'm not used to this format of show\n\n01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:53.880\nyou're doing great but I have a few jokes prepared that I would like to do it\n\n01:47:53.880 --> 01:48:08.560\nwould seem that a man walked into a bar in an auspicious time shit I can't do it\n\n01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:20.480\nall right go ahead with the narration oh what are you I do a guy who a\n\n01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:29.880\ncharacter in the I was the emcee but I don't have the stand-up show of the\n\n01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:35.480\ncomedy hut that I introduced notes during the show okay all right what we go\n\n01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:49.560\nahead meanwhile backstage you said geez I heard I heard Ellen died out there it's\n\n01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:55.640\nnot encouraging yeah hi my name is a better stand-up comic yeah then whoever\n\n01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:59.560\nwould follow Ellen on her own yes she's very experienced I mean for her to eat\n\n01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:09.720\nit out there is like very scary it's her own audience my name is David Spade I\n\n01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:15.000\nalso have a veteran comic and I'm very scared based on what I just heard out\n\n01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:31.640\nthere your names Jack yes okay all right okay all right all right we only have\n\n01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:37.280\ntime for one comedy space so we're gonna have to have two comics go up at the\n\n01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:44.200\nsame time so well Jack and David Spade please report to the front of the stage\n\n01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:50.160\nman repeat the front of the stage not the back or either I are you cool with\n\n01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:53.440\nthis reporting to the front of the stage yeah it doesn't sound like we have a\n\n01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:59.120\nchoice all right okay ladies and gentlemen for the first time only at the\n\n01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:04.080\ncomedy hut it's David Spade and Jack bring it up bring it up bring it up\n\n01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:16.760\nbring up the levels of laughter and clapping look the two of us can't don't\n\n01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:36.160\nlike airline food doesn't matter I can't I can't do
