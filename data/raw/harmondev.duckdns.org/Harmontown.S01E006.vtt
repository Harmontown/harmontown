live on stage,\n\n00:07.760 --> 00:12.160\nsimply because we lost the first three minutes\n\n00:12.160 --> 00:14.520\nof our recording due to a little technical crash,\n\n00:14.520 --> 00:15.360\nit happens.\n\n00:16.560 --> 00:20.840\nYou only miss the very beginning of the live recording,\n\n00:20.840 --> 00:24.800\nbut so I'm just introducing it to make it make sense.\n\n00:25.920 --> 00:28.760\nWhile I've got your ear, I will caution you,\n\n00:28.760 --> 00:32.040\nthis is an unexpectedly intimate episode of Harmontown.\n\n00:33.240 --> 00:38.240\nAnd I, you know, they're not usually family fair,\n\n00:38.240 --> 00:42.400\nbut I will say, if you had any respect for me\n\n00:42.400 --> 00:44.920\nor my friend Rob Schrab,\n\n00:44.920 --> 00:49.920\nand it was based in any way on our manners,\n\n00:51.160 --> 00:54.240\nor our concern for our own posteriors,\n\n00:54.240 --> 00:57.520\nand lack of experimentation with them,\n\n00:58.760 --> 01:01.040\nyou know, maybe don't listen to this episode.\n\n01:01.040 --> 01:06.040\nMaybe just watch community and the other shows\n\n01:07.880 --> 01:09.600\nand comic books and things that we make,\n\n01:09.600 --> 01:11.800\nand think of us as decent people,\n\n01:11.800 --> 01:13.880\nbut you're gonna, if you do listen on,\n\n01:13.880 --> 01:18.480\nyou're gonna hear a story from me about my butt hole,\n\n01:19.920 --> 01:23.040\nand a story from Rob about his.\n\n01:23.040 --> 01:24.760\nWe didn't plan for that to be the theme of the evening,\n\n01:24.760 --> 01:26.760\nbut it really turned out to be the case.\n\n01:28.760 --> 01:29.600\nThat's about it.\n\n01:29.600 --> 01:33.920\nOh, I also just wanna plug Harmontown Schrab's Found Crap,\n\n01:33.920 --> 01:36.480\nwhich is gonna be part of the Everything Is Terrible festival\n\n01:36.480 --> 01:40.080\non August 26th, I think at 5.30 p.m.\n\n01:41.080 --> 01:42.840\nCome see, Rob Schrab puts together\n\n01:42.840 --> 01:45.080\nall these amazing found footage things.\n\n01:45.080 --> 01:47.280\nIf you're in Los Angeles or near Los Angeles,\n\n01:47.280 --> 01:49.840\nit's definitely worth coming out for.\n\n01:49.840 --> 01:53.200\nBoth he and I will be there and love to see you there.\n\n01:53.200 --> 01:55.440\nSo we now join Harmontown in progress\n\n01:55.440 --> 01:58.000\njust to give you the context.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.640\nJeff started the show with some sexy music.\n\n02:00.640 --> 02:02.360\nWe were talking about sexy music.\n\n02:02.360 --> 02:03.480\nIt reminded me of the fact\n\n02:03.480 --> 02:06.680\nthat I had given my girlfriend a little fashion show recently\n\n02:06.680 --> 02:11.320\nto Shade music, or I'm sorry, one more time.\n\n02:12.400 --> 02:14.600\nSo we now join Harmontown in progress,\n\n02:14.600 --> 02:16.120\njust to give you the context.\n\n02:16.120 --> 02:17.200\nWhat you miss at the beginning\n\n02:17.200 --> 02:19.520\nis that Jeff started the show with some sexy music\n\n02:19.520 --> 02:20.640\nwhich reminded me of the fact\n\n02:20.640 --> 02:22.320\nthat I had given my girlfriend\n\n02:22.320 --> 02:26.520\na little fashion show a couple days earlier\n\n02:26.520 --> 02:27.840\nbecause she had bought me some new clothes.\n\n02:27.840 --> 02:29.480\nSo here we go.\n\n02:29.480 --> 02:34.280\nAnd she said what music makes you feel sexy?\n\n02:34.280 --> 02:37.560\nAnd I immediately inexplicably blurted out, Shade.\n\n02:37.560 --> 02:42.560\nSo it's just like, we're just playing a Shade album\n\n02:43.160 --> 02:46.200\nand I was trying on a bunch of checkered nerd shirts.\n\n02:47.400 --> 02:48.640\nWas it Smooth Operator?\n\n02:48.640 --> 02:50.520\nYeah, well, that was Smooth Operator was in there.\n\n02:50.520 --> 02:52.720\nSweetest Taboo, of course.\n\n02:52.720 --> 02:55.680\nI remember, it brought to mind a memory\n\n02:55.680 --> 02:57.920\nthat I thought was so odd.\n\n02:57.920 --> 03:02.200\nWhen I was in junior high in Milwaukee in the 80s,\n\n03:02.200 --> 03:03.200\nthey had this thing.\n\n03:03.200 --> 03:07.160\nThey were called desegregation traps.\n\n03:07.160 --> 03:09.120\nThey had come up with this thing\n\n03:09.120 --> 03:12.000\nwhere we had so many inner city schools\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.640\nthat were so predominantly African-American.\n\n03:14.640 --> 03:16.200\nBy the way, I hate that phrase.\n\n03:16.200 --> 03:18.560\nIsn't that a little demeaning African-American?\n\n03:18.560 --> 03:19.960\nThey're not African.\n\n03:19.960 --> 03:22.120\nThat makes it sound like they're foreigners.\n\n03:22.120 --> 03:24.200\nNo one has a, well, no one is more American\n\n03:24.200 --> 03:26.160\nthan a black person.\n\n03:26.160 --> 03:28.760\nWho has more right to not be hyphenated like that?\n\n03:28.760 --> 03:30.280\nThat's terrible.\n\n03:30.280 --> 03:33.560\nAnyways, but it's up to them.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:38.440\nI actually thought, I always thought,\n\n03:38.440 --> 03:40.240\nbut it's, you know.\n\n03:40.240 --> 03:41.240\nWhat?\n\n03:41.240 --> 03:44.320\nWe're gonna do race again.\n\n03:44.320 --> 03:47.320\nI thought we settled this in like three Harmontowns.\n\n03:47.320 --> 03:49.920\nI didn't even get a chance to talk about it last time.\n\n03:49.920 --> 03:53.520\nYou dicks got all, all open to you about it.\n\n03:53.520 --> 03:55.320\nHe wanted to hear about Mars rovers\n\n03:55.320 --> 03:59.520\nand, you know, Schrab was heckling and we might bring\n\n03:59.520 --> 04:00.520\nSchrab up later.\n\n04:00.520 --> 04:02.520\nI want him to tell his butthole doctor story,\n\n04:02.520 --> 04:04.920\nbut I'm way off track already.\n\n04:04.920 --> 04:08.120\nThis is not a, this is gonna be a low-key harmony.\n\n04:08.120 --> 04:11.360\nI'm very, very hungover.\n\n04:11.360 --> 04:12.360\nWhat was I just talking about?\n\n04:12.360 --> 04:15.360\nOkay, race, desegregation.\n\n04:15.360 --> 04:18.120\nIt doesn't, nothing, I, it doesn't really,\n\n04:18.120 --> 04:20.120\nthe story has nothing to do with race, really.\n\n04:20.120 --> 04:22.120\nI bet it does.\n\n04:22.120 --> 04:24.120\nI, in eighth grade, seventh and eighth grade,\n\n04:24.120 --> 04:28.120\nI went to Stuyben Middle School.\n\n04:28.120 --> 04:29.120\nStuyben.\n\n04:29.120 --> 04:31.120\nAnd, you know, I was, you know,\n\n04:31.120 --> 04:34.120\nI went to Stuyben Middle School.\n\n04:34.120 --> 04:37.120\nI went to Stuyben Middle School.\n\n04:37.120 --> 04:41.120\nAnd it was, it was for the computer specialty,\n\n04:41.120 --> 04:43.120\nwhich was a desegregation trap.\n\n04:43.120 --> 04:46.120\nIn reality, they had six Apple II E's in the basement.\n\n04:46.120 --> 04:49.120\nAnd they just wanted to, they were trying to bus\n\n04:49.120 --> 04:55.120\nwhite kids into schools that were so disproportionately black.\n\n04:55.120 --> 04:57.120\nAnd so I was like one of six white kids there\n\n04:57.120 --> 05:00.120\nto use their Apple II E's in the school.\n\n05:00.120 --> 05:01.120\nIt was great.\n\n05:01.120 --> 05:06.120\nBy the way, white people, much more racist than black people.\n\n05:06.120 --> 05:09.120\nThat's, that's a, that's a genetic trait\n\n05:09.120 --> 05:11.120\nthat I can actually, I believe in,\n\n05:11.120 --> 05:14.120\nbecause I went to, for much of my public school life,\n\n05:14.120 --> 05:16.120\nI went to predominantly black schools.\n\n05:16.120 --> 05:18.120\nAnd I never got picked on or,\n\n05:18.120 --> 05:21.120\nit was only when I went to the suburbs\n\n05:21.120 --> 05:24.120\nand started, you know, in these more predominantly white schools,\n\n05:24.120 --> 05:26.120\nI started getting picked on like a,\n\n05:26.120 --> 05:28.120\nremember a girl took a piece of tape\n\n05:28.120 --> 05:31.120\nand taped it secretly to a pair of jeans\n\n05:31.120 --> 05:35.120\nas a way of tracking how often I wore them in a week.\n\n05:35.120 --> 05:39.120\nOoh.\n\n05:39.120 --> 05:42.120\nLike I was some kind of animal.\n\n05:42.120 --> 05:44.120\nI was like, this did, black people don't do this.\n\n05:44.120 --> 05:46.120\nThat's, that's a stereotype.\n\n05:46.120 --> 05:50.120\nI am, I am comfortable saying black people are nicer than this.\n\n05:50.120 --> 05:54.120\nI'm not, I'm not a big fan of racial constructs,\n\n05:54.120 --> 05:56.120\nbut I believe black people are nicer\n\n05:56.120 --> 05:58.120\nand less racist than white people there.\n\n05:58.120 --> 05:59.120\nOkay.\n\n05:59.120 --> 06:01.120\nI did get a little, so I was going,\n\n06:01.120 --> 06:04.120\nthe story's not about race, everybody.\n\n06:04.120 --> 06:07.120\nWould you guys take it easy?\n\n06:07.120 --> 06:10.120\nThis is, this story will not lean towards race.\n\n06:10.120 --> 06:11.120\nAnd we're, you know what I'm saying?\n\n06:11.120 --> 06:12.120\nWe, we chased NT off.\n\n06:12.120 --> 06:13.120\nWhere's NT?\n\n06:13.120 --> 06:15.120\nThere are, he was, he was, he was always in the front row.\n\n06:15.120 --> 06:16.120\nEmpty seat.\n\n06:16.120 --> 06:19.120\nEm, empty, empty seat.\n\n06:19.120 --> 06:20.120\nUh, dumb.\n\n06:20.120 --> 06:22.120\nEdit it out.\n\n06:22.120 --> 06:23.120\nJust stupid.\n\n06:23.120 --> 06:24.120\nLeave it.\n\n06:24.120 --> 06:26.120\nLeave it.\n\n06:26.120 --> 06:27.120\nIt stays.\n\n06:27.120 --> 06:29.120\nI, I'm not, I'm not witty tonight.\n\n06:29.120 --> 06:30.120\nI'm not, I can tell.\n\n06:30.120 --> 06:33.120\nI have a verbal thinker and I can,\n\n06:33.120 --> 06:37.120\nI can feel the muscle in my, in my verbal lobe.\n\n06:37.120 --> 06:39.120\nUh, you know, I can tell you,\n\n06:39.120 --> 06:41.120\nthere's days when it's on fire, you know,\n\n06:41.120 --> 06:43.120\nand it's kind of spinning and, and, and,\n\n06:43.120 --> 06:45.120\nand you know, I was like, I'm going to rock it.\n\n06:45.120 --> 06:47.120\nUh, talking to people tonight.\n\n06:47.120 --> 06:48.120\nCan I, can I, have we told the story\n\n06:48.120 --> 06:51.120\nor can I ask you to tell the story about a roll call?\n\n06:51.120 --> 06:53.120\nUh, and you know what I'm talking about?\n\n06:53.120 --> 06:54.120\nThe guy?\n\n06:54.120 --> 06:55.120\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n06:55.120 --> 06:56.120\nThe guy who subverted roll call?\n\n06:56.120 --> 06:57.120\nYeah, that, that, well, that all, yeah.\n\n06:57.120 --> 06:58.120\nThat takes place at the same school.\n\n06:58.120 --> 06:59.120\nI just wanted to tell the story.\n\n06:59.120 --> 07:01.120\nI don't know, I don't, I don't think it's a good story.\n\n07:01.120 --> 07:03.120\nSo buckle up.\n\n07:03.120 --> 07:05.120\nUh, Shade reminded me of this.\n\n07:05.120 --> 07:06.120\nShade.\n\n07:06.120 --> 07:09.120\nI was, I was in this computer specialty school\n\n07:09.120 --> 07:11.120\nand I was in my one computer class.\n\n07:11.120 --> 07:13.120\nI was taught by this guy named Mr. Blanchett.\n\n07:13.120 --> 07:17.120\nHe caught a girl slipping, uh, uh, uh,\n\n07:17.120 --> 07:20.120\nanother girl on note or something.\n\n07:20.120 --> 07:22.120\nAnd he, and so he did that awesome thing\n\n07:22.120 --> 07:26.120\nwhere you take the note and then he, he, he read it out loud.\n\n07:26.120 --> 07:28.120\nAnd it was just some, it was like,\n\n07:28.120 --> 07:32.120\nit was the girl was making fun of some other kid in the class\n\n07:32.120 --> 07:37.120\nby going, uh, oh, I know, I know, I know you love, uh, uh,\n\n07:37.120 --> 07:38.120\nRonald.\n\n07:38.120 --> 07:42.120\nI know, you know, he, I know he gives you the sweetest taboo.\n\n07:42.120 --> 07:46.120\nAnd he, he's face turned purple.\n\n07:46.120 --> 07:49.120\nAnd he's like, you don't even know what that means.\n\n07:49.120 --> 07:51.120\nYou know what, I ain't even talking about that.\n\n07:51.120 --> 07:52.120\nYou're 13 years old.\n\n07:52.120 --> 07:53.120\nYou don't even know what that means.\n\n07:53.120 --> 07:56.120\nI was like, no one knows what that means.\n\n07:56.120 --> 07:59.120\nYou're not, you're not a real Shade fan.\n\n07:59.120 --> 08:00.120\nYeah, exactly.\n\n08:00.120 --> 08:02.120\nThe hardest core Shade fan.\n\n08:02.120 --> 08:04.120\nI've been to four of her concerts.\n\n08:04.120 --> 08:08.120\nI just really, I'm pretty sure it means fucking, uh, probably.\n\n08:08.120 --> 08:12.120\nAnd no one knows what that means more than a bunch of 13 year olds.\n\n08:12.120 --> 08:15.120\nLike, we're, we're, we're coming in our pants.\n\n08:15.120 --> 08:17.120\nLike, like, like, like, like, like by reading math books,\n\n08:17.120 --> 08:19.120\nlike at that age, everybody gets,\n\n08:19.120 --> 08:21.120\nthe school smelled like Gen Con.\n\n08:21.120 --> 08:25.120\nIt was so, uh, it was, you know,\n\n08:25.120 --> 08:29.120\nthere was so much testosterone and estrogen bursting out of us.\n\n08:29.120 --> 08:32.120\nOur faces were festooned with, with hormonal acne.\n\n08:32.120 --> 08:34.120\nAnd all of us were, you know,\n\n08:34.120 --> 08:38.120\nrunning into dark corners to touch ourselves every chance we got.\n\n08:38.120 --> 08:41.120\nI think, I think we know what the sweetest taboo is.\n\n08:41.120 --> 08:44.120\nI think it's bucket.\n\n08:44.120 --> 08:49.120\nUh, in that same school, because you requested the story.\n\n08:49.120 --> 08:54.120\nThis one is by request.\n\n08:54.120 --> 08:57.120\nUm, we were taking roll call.\n\n08:57.120 --> 08:59.120\nWe're going to play sexy music over this.\n\n08:59.120 --> 09:01.120\nWe were taking roll call as math class.\n\n09:01.120 --> 09:03.120\nThe teacher said, it was the beginning of the school year.\n\n09:03.120 --> 09:06.120\nAnd the teacher said, I'll call your name.\n\n09:06.120 --> 09:08.120\nYou say

--> 09:57.120\nIt's so good.\n\n09:57.120 --> 10:00.120\nUh, if I had been that teacher, I would have said, all right.\n\n10:00.120 --> 10:02.120\nAnd I would have called him up to the board every time.\n\n10:02.120 --> 10:03.120\nYeah.\n\n10:03.120 --> 10:05.120\nUh, what's the square root of 151?\n\n10:05.120 --> 10:08.120\nRoyal Champagne, would you treat us?\n\n10:08.120 --> 10:10.120\nWell, there was such a, she was probably scared.\n\n10:10.120 --> 10:13.120\nIt was like, uh, you know, you never knew back then it was like,\n\n10:13.120 --> 10:15.120\nthey had to have rules against magic markers.\n\n10:15.120 --> 10:17.120\nIt was such an odd thing.\n\n10:17.120 --> 10:22.120\nI don't know if this, if this was a place in time or if this is true for\n\n10:22.120 --> 10:27.120\n12 and 13-year-olds in middle school, but everyone was obsessed with gangs.\n\n10:27.120 --> 10:30.120\nNone of us were in any, uh, like, but everyone was like,\n\n10:30.120 --> 10:34.120\nthey were always drawing little pitchfork symbols and, and, and stars.\n\n10:34.120 --> 10:38.120\nThey were gang symbols for the local Milwaukee gangs on the walls.\n\n10:38.120 --> 10:40.120\nThis is, this is junior high school?\n\n10:40.120 --> 10:41.120\nOr, uh, this is junior high.\n\n10:41.120 --> 10:44.120\nYeah, we're, I mean, we're not, you know, but nobody in that school was\n\n10:44.120 --> 10:49.120\nrolling with the two seven boys, uh, which was one of the local gangs\n\n10:49.120 --> 10:52.120\nfrom 27th Street and then there were the black gangster disciples,\n\n10:52.120 --> 10:55.120\nBGD, and their symbol was like a little pitchfork.\n\n10:55.120 --> 10:57.120\nUm, I'm holding up my hand to form a little pitchfork.\n\n10:57.120 --> 10:59.120\nThose pitchforks aren't straight, man.\n\n10:59.120 --> 11:00.120\nOh God.\n\n11:00.120 --> 11:01.120\nThat reminds me of the story.\n\n11:01.120 --> 11:03.120\nI'm like, yeah, there was a, we were in metal shop and, uh,\n\n11:03.120 --> 11:06.120\nthen the teacher put on a slide projector and then just like 85,\n\n11:06.120 --> 11:11.120\nlike pitchfork shadows come into, into the thing, including me probably.\n\n11:11.120 --> 11:14.120\nIt just became a thing. It was like that and beatboxing, we were all just doing it.\n\n11:14.120 --> 11:15.120\nIt was, it was the culture.\n\n11:15.120 --> 11:17.120\nIt was like, you did, people were walking down the hall just going,\n\n11:17.120 --> 11:22.120\num, you just did it all the time.\n\n11:22.120 --> 11:24.120\nWait, wait, wait, that was pretty good.\n\n11:24.120 --> 11:25.120\nYeah.\n\n11:25.120 --> 11:32.120\nI, I, I went to shooibin.\n\n11:32.120 --> 11:35.120\nNo, no, no, no one actually did that.\n\n11:35.120 --> 11:37.120\nThat was a, don't, don't extend yourself.\n\n11:37.120 --> 11:38.120\nYeah.\n\n11:38.120 --> 11:40.120\nWell, no, that's, that's the hacky thing.\n\n11:40.120 --> 11:43.120\nMy, my mom, I used to come home and do that.\n\n11:43.120 --> 11:44.120\nMy mom's impressed.\n\n11:44.120 --> 11:45.120\nI should go, well, you stop doing that with the,\n\n11:45.120 --> 11:48.120\nI'm stop, I'm stop, I'm stop, I'm stop.\n\n11:48.120 --> 11:49.120\nI'm stop, I'm stop.\n\n11:49.120 --> 11:53.120\nThere's not a white guy in this room that hasn't tried his hand at beatbox at some point.\n\n11:53.120 --> 11:54.120\nWe've all tried it.\n\n11:54.120 --> 11:55.120\nYeah.\n\n11:55.120 --> 11:58.120\nI'm, I'm darn good at it in a pinch.\n\n11:58.120 --> 12:02.120\nUh, the, uh, so, so, uh, let's see, there was budge.\n\n12:02.120 --> 12:03.120\nOh

guy,\n\n12:10.120 --> 12:13.120\nJohn Morse, uh, who was this big tall, he was like,\n\n12:13.120 --> 12:15.120\nseemed like it was nine feet tall.\n\n12:15.120 --> 12:18.120\nYou know, it was one of those beanpole, like, like, like,\n\n12:18.120 --> 12:21.120\nlike, sprouters and, uh, and he was kind of like,\n\n12:21.120 --> 12:23.120\nI think it was a little touched.\n\n12:23.120 --> 12:26.120\nI think he was one of those kids who slips through the cracks.\n\n12:26.120 --> 12:29.120\nLike he's, he wasn't special enough to take advantage of being special.\n\n12:29.120 --> 12:33.120\nHe was, he was just, you know, you just, you just felt like he was,\n\n12:33.120 --> 12:37.120\nhe was destined for, for bad times or Verizon employment, you know,\n\n12:37.120 --> 12:41.120\nlike, he's, he's just going to end up and, and, and, and he,\n\n12:41.120 --> 12:44.120\nhe would, he would just sit in the class and beat box and do his\n\n12:44.120 --> 12:47.120\npitchforks and then like, uh, he, yeah, all those shadows came in\n\n12:47.120 --> 12:50.120\nand then you, he is like, the shop teacher is like,\n\n12:50.120 --> 12:51.120\nokay, we're going to watch a film strip.\n\n12:51.120 --> 12:53.120\nAnd he says, all right, all right, all right.\n\n12:53.120 --> 12:55.120\nHe's so sick of seeing pitchfork shadows.\n\n12:55.120 --> 12:58.120\nAnd then you just hear John Morse is the last one in there.\n\n12:58.120 --> 13:02.120\nYou see his other hand come in and physically straighten his own\n\n13:02.120 --> 13:05.120\nfingers like he's perfecting his pitchfork.\n\n13:05.120 --> 13:07.120\nAnd then you just hear John Morse in the, in the dark,\n\n13:07.120 --> 13:11.120\nuh, metal shop room go, damn, my pitchforks is

kids are pure of heart\n\n13:28.120 --> 13:30.120\nand just want to have fun and do things better than, you know,\n\n13:30.120 --> 13:33.120\nwe just want to play video games and fuck around.\n\n13:33.120 --> 13:37.120\nUh, pitchforks, um, uh, my car might get blown up\n\n13:37.120 --> 13:39.120\nby the blank gangster disciples tonight.\n\n13:39.120 --> 13:40.120\nI don't know.\n\n13:40.120 --> 13:42.120\nI don't know if they're comfortable with me talking about them.\n\n13:42.120 --> 13:46.120\nUh, one of their sayings was false flag is a fag.\n\n13:46.120 --> 13:47.120\nOoh.\n\n13:47.120 --> 13:48.120\nYeah.\n\n13:48.120 --> 13:50.120\nYou weren't, you weren't supposed to throw up pitchforks\n\n13:50.120 --> 13:52.120\nif you weren't actually in BGD.\n\n13:52.120 --> 13:56.120\nI went to, I went to public school in Los Angeles\n\n13:56.120 --> 13:58.120\nduring the late 80s, early 90s.\n\n13:58.120 --> 14:01.120\nAnd that's when everybody was in a gang, like for real.\n\n14:01.120 --> 14:02.120\nAnd you went to a party.\n\n14:02.120 --> 14:06.120\nYou could go to a party in like a, a, a lower class neighborhood,\n\n14:06.120 --> 14:09.120\na, a working class, middle class, upper class neighborhood,\n\n14:09.120 --> 14:12.120\nand gangs would come, like the, like Compton Crips,\n\n14:12.120 --> 14:16.120\nlike Bloods would come, like a big bad gun totem,\n\n14:16.120 --> 14:18.120\nbad motherfuckers would show up.\n\n14:18.120 --> 14:20.120\nAnd we were all just like nerds.\n\n14:20.120 --> 14:22.120\nAnd like, like,

mean, even us in Milwaukee were into the ocean Pacific culture.\n\n14:37.120 --> 14:40.120\nAnd you really lived on ocean Pacific.\n\n14:40.120 --> 14:41.120\nI would like, I would like,\n\n14:41.120

in the chest, knocked me down.\n\n15:06.120 --> 15:07.120\nI'm all alone.\n\n15:07.120 --> 15:09.120\nI was, you know, I'm six foot four now,\n\n15:09.120 --> 15:12.120\nbut I was, I was, I was five

skinny.\n\n15:17.120 --> 15:19.120\nAnd these six Latino guys jumped me\n\n15:19.120 --> 15:21.120\nand the main alpha dude walks up\n\n15:21.120 --> 15:23.120\nand he grabs my bandana off and he

15:37.120\nWhat in the strawberry shortcake?\n\n15:37.120 --> 15:39.120\nUnicorn mythology.\n\n15:39.120 --> 15:40.120\nCactus?\n\n15:40.120 --> 15:41.120\nWhat?\n\n15:41.120 --> 15:42.120\nCactus pickles?\n\n15:42.120 --> 15:43.120\nWhat were they called?\n\n15:43.120 --> 15:45.120\nIt was the first I'd heard of them.\n\n15:45.120 --> 15:47.120\nWhat did you say?\n\n15:47.120 --> 15:49.120\nCactus Bunch.\n\n15:49.120 --> 15:50.120\nBunch?\n\n15:50.120 --> 15:51.120\nCactus Bunch.\n\n15:51.120 --> 15:52.120\nA bunch.\n\n15:52.120 --> 15:55.120\nThat's like a Don Knotts Tim Conway movie.\n\n15:55.120 --> 15:56.120\nA bunch?\n\n15:56.120 --> 15:59.120\nThey weren't, I'm not saying it was the toughest gang in town.\n\n15:59.120 --> 16:01.120\nI'm saying, I'm saying there was 14 of them\n\n16:01.120 --> 16:04.120\nand they had my, they had my rag.\n\n16:04.120 --> 16:07.120\nSo the guy took the fucking bandana off\n\n16:07.120 --> 16:08.120\nand he goes, you want his

16:16.120\nCactus, Cactus Bunch, Cactus Bunch was even more dangerous.\n\n16:16.120 --> 16:18.120\nThat's how their wives were.\n\n16:18.120 --> 16:22.120\nYeah, they met at the Bellaire Hotel every Sunday.\n\n16:22.120 --> 16:26.120\nLittle cucumber sandwiches and they would just talk shit.\n\n16:26.120 --> 16:29.120\nThey said, claim it from Cactus Bunch.\n\n16:29.120 --> 16:31.120\nAnd I was like, hey man, I found that.\n\n16:31.120 --> 16:33.120\nIt's yours to keep.\n\n16:33.120 --> 16:36.120\nIt gets too cold in Milwaukee for people to be that violent.\n\n16:36.120 --> 16:39.120\nWe all have to hibernate.\n\n16:39.120 --> 16:42.120\nWe have to save our energy.\n\n16:42.120 --> 16:43.120\nYeah.\n\n16:43.120 --> 16:46.120\nOh, by the way, my apologies to the black gangster disciples,\n\n16:46.120 --> 16:48.120\nthe two seven boys and the Cactus Bunch,\n\n16:48.120 --> 16:50.120\nand the Cactus Bunch, especially the Cactus Bunch,\n\n16:50.120 --> 16:52.120\nbecause, because we really took them.\n\n16:52.120 --> 16:56.120\nI want the Cactus Bunch members that are listening to the podcast\n\n16:56.120 --> 17:00.120\nto know my issue is not with your manhood.\n\n17:00.120 --> 17:03.120\nIt's simply with your nomenclature.\n\n17:03.120 --> 17:10.120\nIt's your ability to name your gang properly that I question.\n\n17:10.120 --> 17:12.120\nI don't question your ability to murder me.\n\n17:12.120 --> 17:15.120\nCactus Bunch, it's so adorable.\n\n17:15.120 --> 17:19.120\nWe're the hug a bunch.\n\n17:19.120 --> 17:23.120\nThere's a really old school gang in Los Angeles called Las Cantaranas,\n\n17:23.120 --> 17:25.120\nwhich is the singing frogs.\n\n17:25.120 --> 17:29.120\nBut they're a very, very old, like, you know, veterano gang.\n\n17:29.120 --> 17:30.120\nAll right.\n\n17:30.120 --> 17:33.120\nWell, my hat's off to them.\n\n17:33.120 --> 17:35.120\nRags at half-mast.\n\n17:35.120 --> 17:38.120\nPitchforks straight.\n\n17:38.120 --> 17:40.120\nLet's get off this topic.\n\n17:40.120 --> 17:42.120\nI feel like I'm going to get in trouble.\n\n17:42.120 --> 17:44.120\nBut speaking of bummers, tonight is going to be a bummer.\n\n17:44.120 --> 17:47.120\nThat's why I got fashion and style advice questions from you guys.\n\n17:47.120 --> 17:51.120\nIt's because I wanted to commit to tonight being a bummer.\n\n17:51.120 --> 17:52.120\nI'm very hungover.\n\n17:52.120 --> 17:54.120\nI went to a bachelor party last night.\n\n17:54.120 --> 17:59.120\nLike I told you, I woke up this morning and I knew I'm not going to be funny tonight.\n\n17:59.120 --> 18:01.120\nI'm not going to be insightful.\n\n18:01.120 --> 18:02.120\nI'm not going to be witty.\n\n18:02.120 --> 18:05.120\nI'm only going to waste your time and steal your $10.\n\n18:05.120 --> 18:09.120\nSo I wanted to just be above board about that.\n\n18:09.120 --> 18:16.120\nAnd so for the questions that we got from the audience tonight, they're on a topic that I am bound to fail at speaking to,\n\n18:16.120 --> 18:18.120\nwhich is style and fashion.\n\n18:18.120 --> 18:25.120\nI picked the worst topic that I could think of to commit to tonight being the worst Harmontown ever.\n\n18:25.120 --> 18:26.120\nSo buckle up.\n\n18:26.120 --> 18:31.120\nAnd if you're listening at home, stop.\n\n18:31.120 --> 18:38.120\nDan, someone from our audience asks, why do all girls think they can wear leggings?\n\n18:38.120 --> 18:40.120\nWhat does that mean?\n\n18:40.120 --> 18:42.120\nBecause they can.\n\n18:42.120 --> 18:46.120\nYoung man?\n\n18:46.120 --> 18:50.120\nWell, aren't they kind of a one-size-fits-all?\n\n18:50.120 --> 18:54.120\nAre leggings just like tights without feet?\n\n18:54.120 --> 18:59.120\nI think that someone's saying that some people wear them to greater acclaim and success than other people.\n\n18:59.120 --> 19:00.120\nWell, that's everything.\n\n19:00.120 --> 19:01.120\nThat's all clothes.\n\n19:01.120 --> 19:03.120\nI'm already pissed off at this category.\n\n19:03.120 --> 19:05.120\nWhat the hell are you talking about?\n\n19:05.120 --> 19:07.120\nYou chose the topic.\n\n19:07.120 --> 19:13.120\nThat's not the tyranny of hot people.\n\n19:13.120 --> 19:16.120\nIf you look good, you can wear a towel.\n\n19:16.120 --> 19:25.120\nWhy do you have to also, in addition to that, ugly people are the ones who should be caring the most about clothes.\n\n19:25.120 --> 19:28.120\nYou shouldn't go, oh, her ass is too fat.\n\n19:28.120 --> 19:29.120\nShe shouldn't be wearing those pants.\n\n19:29.120 --> 19:36.120\nFuck you, you bad person.\n\n19:36.120 --> 19:39.120\nI told you, I wasn't kidding, man.\n\n19:39.120 --> 19:42.120\nI'm not on all four cylinders tonight.\n\n19:42.120 --> 19:44.120\nI'm on two.\n\n19:44.120 --> 19:46.120\nWhy?\n\n19:46.120 --> 19:47.120\nBecause they can.\n\n19:47.120 --> 19:48.120\nThey can wear leggings.\n\n19:48.120 --> 19:50.120\nShame on you.\n\n19:50.120 --> 19:54.120\nYou snarky David Spade type.\n\n19:54.120 --> 19:58.120\nAll right, Dan.\n\n19:58.120 --> 20:00.120\nLet's see you in a pair of leggings.\n\n20:00.120 --> 20:04.120\nMs. Thang or Mr.\n\n20:04.120 --> 20:06.120\nAnd this question, if you were a lady.\n\n20:06.120 --> 20:07.120\nI will say this.\n\n20:07.120 --> 20:08.120\nSorry.\n\n20:08.120 --> 20:12.120\nHere's a good question that should be asked.\n\n20:12.120 --> 20:22.120\nWhy do some women, how do you find out as a woman, when do you learn who tells you what newsletter do you get that tells you that you can't just wear tights as pants?\n\n20:22.120 --> 20:27.120\nYou ever go to the mall and you just see some lady who didn't get the telegram.\n\n20:27.120 --> 20:31.120\nShe's just wearing, it's so jarring visually.\n\n20:31.120 --> 20:34.120\nSo it's like, you're just not wearing any pants.\n\n20:34.120 --> 20:36.120\nThose are underwear.\n\n20:36.120 --> 20:38.120\nAnd you're just wearing them like you do.\n\n20:38.120 --> 20:46.120\nIs it just like a thing that you see someone else doing it and then you do it and that's like someone has to, you know, tights aren't pants for sure.\n\n20:46.120 --> 20:48.120\nI know that.\n\n20:48.120 --> 20:51.120\nThat's not like a no white after labor day thing.\n\n20:51.120 --> 20:56.120\nThat's like a you can't just wear underwear for pants.\n\n20:56.120 --> 20:58.120\nThose are tights.\n\n20:58.120 --> 20:59.120\nBut you love tights.\n\n20:59.120 --> 21:07.120\nYeah, I do, but I like them because I mean their tights aren't really just just wearing a pair of tights walking around the mall isn't that's not flattering on anybody.\n\n21:07.120 --> 21:11.120\nYou could be, I'm going to date myself, Cindy Crawford.\n\n21:11.120 --> 21:13.120\nI don't know who's who's hot now.\n\n21:13.120 --> 21:15.120\nWho's who's the Kate Moss?\n\n21:15.120 --> 21:17.120\nYou could be Kate Moss.\n\n21:20.120 --> 21:22.120\nLet's get lost tonight.\n\n21:22.120 --> 21:29.120\nYou could be my black Kate Moss tonight.\n\n21:29.120 --> 21:34.120\nDan, if you were a lady, somebody asked and I am.\n\n21:34.120 --> 21:37.120\nWhat kind of dress would you wear?\n\n21:37.120 --> 21:39.120\nOh, that's a good question.\n\n21:39.120 --> 21:50.120\nIf I were a, if I were a lady, I would, I would, I would, I think I would dress a lot like the, the beautiful red headed poet girl from head of the class.\n\n21:50.120 --> 21:56.120\nI think I would have a kind of like Laura Ingalls wilder kind of Bohemian Edie Brackel kind of.\n\n21:56.120 --> 22:08.120\nI think I'd wear a lot of very long skirts with with with with now you're dating yourself with with tights and like like a cardigan sweater.\n\n22:08.120 --> 22:15.120\nYou're like, you're like a like a horny Iceman or your, your, your, your boner is frozen in like 1987.\n\n22:15.120 --> 22:17.120\nOh man, it really is.\n\n22:17.120 --> 22:28.120\nI, I, I, I, you know, for pornography, while other people are going to the you porn and the, and the porn hub dot coms, I will often, I believe me, I will go there too.\n\n22:28.120 --> 22:33.120\nBut I will often go to YouTube and just type in like aerobics.\n\n22:35.120 --> 22:38.120\nAnd it's enough for me.\n\n22:38.120 --> 22:43.120\nCynthia Caroluck was a Canadian fitness lady.\n\n22:43.120 --> 22:47.120\nShe was just, she was just 80s.\n\n22:47.120 --> 22:49.120\nShe was intact this bunch, wasn't she?\n\n22:49.120 --> 22:57.120\nShe went to, she would always, you know, she would, she would pronounce a boot wrong and tell you how to exercise.\n\n22:57.120 --> 23:06.120\nAnd she would, you know, she'd wear like these like leotards and cross trainers and white socks and tights, pantyhose, whatever, whatever.\n\n23:06.120 --> 23:12.120\nWhat is your obsession with like, because like, I like stockings, but like for some reason tights less so.\n\n23:12.120 --> 23:17.120\nI can't qualify why that is, but you love tights and like leggings.\n\n23:17.120 --> 23:20.120\nI just like, I like women.\n\n23:20.120 --> 23:22.120\nI like that they're soft and fun to touch.\n\n23:22.120 --> 23:30.120\nI want them to be, I just, I like, I like the, you know, it's weird.\n\n23:30.120 --> 23:39.120\nFetishes are weird because there's a, there's a logic to them to a certain degree, but then there's just some weird, I think something happened to me when I was six years old or something.\n\n23:39.120 --> 23:48.120\nA lot of people who have like feet fetishes or, or like nylon fetishes, they'll, they'll have memories of like playing under the table with their matchbox cars.\n\n23:48.120 --> 23:51.120\nWell, and their, and their aunt was crossing and uncrossing their legs.\n\n23:51.120 --> 23:54.120\nLike they'll have a visceral memory of some sexual awakening for them.\n\n23:54.120 --> 23:58.120\nAnd I think what it is, is that I think your brain just pops like popcorn.\n\n23:58.120 --> 24:05.120\nI think, I think there's a certain point as a primate that you're just walking down the street and, and you're going to turn into a sexual entity.\n\n24:05.120 --> 24:12.120\nAnd, and, and unfortunately, whatever you're looking at, whatever, whatever's around you, you're going to, okay, he's a chocolate file.\n\n24:12.120 --> 24:14.120\nWait, it's a Hersha file.\n\n24:14.120 --> 24:22.120\nI don't remember what era it would have been, but I'm pretty sure I drove one of my, like either my old crappy Volkswagen or my shitty Honda.\n\n24:22.120 --> 24:28.120\nAnd I drove you to Sunset and La Brea to, was it a Wendy's or an El Pollo?\n\n24:28.120 --> 24:30.120\nOh man, this is a little embarrassing.\n\n24:30.120 --> 24:31.120\nYeah.\n\n24:31.120 --> 24:33.120\nOkay, go ahead.\n\n24:33.120 --> 24:38.120\nYes, you drove me to buy, this is before the internet was really a thing.\n\n24:38.120 --> 24:39.120\nI'll say.\n\n24:39.120 --> 24:43.120\nYou drove me to buy, I was, I had arranged.\n\n24:43.120 --> 24:47.120\nIt was like going to a drug deal.\n\n24:47.120 --> 24:56.120\nI had arranged to buy VHS tapes from a guy who was in town who I, on the internet, the internet existed, but it wasn't like a place where you could watch video yet.\n\n24:56.120 --> 25:01.120\nThat, that didn't happen until Rob Schrab and I invented it with Channel 101.\n\n25:01.120 --> 25:05.120\nDo you want to explain what VHS tapes are?\n\n25:05.120 --> 25:08.120\nThey are these giant cassettes.\n\n25:08.120 --> 25:11.120\nShut up.\n\n25:11.120 --> 25:23.120\nYou drove me to a clandestine meeting with a guy who made videos of women just basically wearing tights and pantyhose and hanging out.\n\n25:23.120 --> 25:34.120\nLike you wouldn't, it doesn't even count as pornography, like there's a certain breed of video I watch where it's like, it'll just be a woman at a desk just going like, hello sir.\n\n25:34.120 --> 25:38.120\nYou want me to hold your calls and then she just kind of crosses her legs.\n\n25:38.120 --> 25:40.120\nIt's called James Bond.\n\n25:40.120 --> 25:43.120\nAnd then they start just robbing and I just, next day.\n\n25:43.120 --> 25:49.120\nBut a guy like, you got out of my car and we're at the Wendy's or El Pollo Loco or whatever it was, Sunset and La Brea.\n\n25:49.120 --> 25:53.120\nAnd I'm waiting in the car like, shit, something's about to go bad, man.\n\n25:53.120 --> 25:54.120\nI got a bad feeling about this.\n\n25:54.120 --> 25:59.120\nAnd a guy came out with a ratty old cardboard box full of VHS tapes.\n\n25:59.120 --> 26:02.120\nWell, because I'm not going to buy one, so I bought all of them.\n\n26:02.120 --> 26:06.120\nAnd it wouldn't make sense to buy one.\n\n26:06.120 --> 26:08.120\nLike, okay, how many do you have?\n\n26:08.120 --> 26:11.120\nAnd at the time I was just kind of rolling and like heat vision and Jack money.\n\n26:11.120 --> 26:13.120\nLike, I didn't know what to do.\n\n26:13.120 --> 26:15.120\nI was living in a one bedroom apartment in Hollywood.\n\n26:15.120 --> 26:22.120\nJust 550 a month and I had like $300,000, like, you know, just sitting in a pile.\n\n26:22.120 --> 26:24.120\nAnd I was like, what do I do?\n\n26:24.120 --> 26:25.120\nWhat do we do?\n\n26:25.120 --> 26:26.120\nA Wilcox apartment?\n\n26:26.120 --> 26:27.120\nYeah.\n\n26:27.120 --> 26:28.120\nYeah.\n\n26:28.120 --> 26:29.120\nYeah.\n\n26:29.120 --> 26:30.120\nWilcox.\n\n26:30.120 --> 26:31.120\nThat apartment was amazing.\n\n26:31.120 --> 26:33.120\nCause there was a little like, like a eight unit like apartment building.\n\n26:33.120 --> 26:36.120\nLike this is a regular old like Hollywood apartment building.\n\n26:36.120 --> 26:39.120\nAnd you walked in and Dan had bought the world's biggest desk.\n\n26:39.120 --> 26:41.120\nLike the desk was most of the room, right?\n\n26:41.120 --> 26:42.120\nYeah.\n\n26:42.120 --> 26:44.120\nIt was almost as big as my living room.\n\n26:44.120 --> 26:47.520\nDan, at that point in his life, had decided he was going to be like Einstein and wear\n\n26:47.520 --> 26:50.640\nthe same outfit every day, so yeah.\n\n26:50.640 --> 26:51.640\nSeth Brundle.\n\n26:51.640 --> 26:57.040\nSo yeah, he'd gone to Sears and bought like what, like a dozen of the same blue shirts.\n\n26:57.040 --> 27:04.800\nI got like these baby blue short sleeve button shirts and like six black ties.\n\n27:04.800 --> 27:08.560\nSo if you wanted to visit Dan, it looked like he wanted to go visit the manager of the local\n\n27:08.560 --> 27:09.560\nAlbertsons.\n\n27:09.560 --> 27:17.000\nExcept, I dressed like Gus from Breaking Bad, but there was porn, mountain dew and pizza\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nboxes everywhere.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:21.000\nYeah, there was a lot of porn and a little mannequin part sometimes.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:25.640\nSo I never got to see that hidden away in his bedroom, there was the only part of Dan's\n\n27:25.640 --> 27:29.480\nlife that had any shame that he wouldn't allow everybody to see.\n\n27:29.480 --> 27:34.200\nLike I went toward the bedroom, you kind of demurred one time when I went toward the bedroom\n\n27:34.200 --> 27:36.560\nand like, no, no, no, no, that's the menagerie.\n\n27:36.560 --> 27:40.680\nWell, that's what Rob called it, the menagerie.\n\n27:40.680 --> 27:41.680\nWhat was the menagerie?\n\n27:41.680 --> 27:47.840\nWell, it was, look, I was trying to figure out who I was and what I was into.\n\n27:47.840 --> 27:52.360\nI knew it had something to do with legs and nylon and...\n\n27:52.360 --> 27:53.360\nAnd cadavers.\n\n27:53.360 --> 28:01.040\nWell, you certainly would have a strong case for profiling me as a serial killer back then.\n\n28:01.040 --> 28:07.760\nI've since moved on and I date human women now and everything's fine, but yeah, I was\n\n28:07.760 --> 28:12.120\nlike, well, here, what my thing was, I was a serial monogamous, I kept getting in these\n\n28:12.120 --> 28:17.280\nrelationships, I kept wasting women's time and then it always ended in heartbreak and\n\n28:17.280 --> 28:22.640\nI was like, you know, I sure like jerking off and if I can just figure out how to do\n\n28:22.640 --> 28:29.360\nit perfectly, if I can just be the Chuck Jagger of masturbation, if I can figure out what\n\n28:29.360 --> 28:33.760\nit is that really flips my switches and then just be happy.\n\n28:33.760 --> 28:37.800\nThat was the whole point behind getting the shirts and that was also, there was a reading\n\n28:37.800 --> 28:40.840\nCampbell's Hero of the Thousand Faces for the first time and I was becoming obsessive\n\n28:40.840 --> 28:46.040\nas drawing circles everywhere and like trying to figure out this, like simplify the story\n\n28:46.040 --> 28:47.040\nmodel.\n\n28:47.040 --> 28:56.800\nI was self-actualized, I admired that mannequin fucking a Gus Fring serial killer.\n\n28:56.800 --> 28:59.200\nWhat comprised the menagerie?\n\n28:59.200 --> 29:05.000\nIt was just, okay, at one point I bought a mannequin to see what that would be like.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nA full body mannequin.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:07.000\nYeah, because I thought-\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:08.520\nWhere do you go to buy a mannequin?\n\n29:08.520 --> 29:12.680\nYou were like online, it was like I ordered it from like a mannequin warehouse.\n\n29:12.680 --> 29:17.040\nDid you pretend to be like a fashion designer or something?\n\n29:17.040 --> 29:21.600\nI don't know, well, I fell back on the idea that what I was doing was so weird that no\n\n29:21.600 --> 29:25.360\none would ever suspect, no one would ever go, hey, are you gonna fuck this?\n\n29:25.360 --> 29:27.480\nWho would think that?\n\n29:27.480 --> 29:28.480\nI'm weird.\n\n29:28.480 --> 29:32.440\nI bet that amounts to like 50% of their mannequin sales.\n\n29:32.440 --> 29:36.520\nI read stuff about, there's a whole branch of the fetish that's like, you know, there\n\n29:36.520 --> 29:41.760\nwas a story in the paper, there's no such thing as paper anymore, but there was a story\n\n29:41.760 --> 29:46.080\nonline, I remember reading about a guy who got arrested because for the third time or\n\n29:46.080 --> 29:49.880\nsomething he smashed a display window of a certain story.\n\n29:49.880 --> 29:52.680\nHe was in love with a mannequin.\n\n29:52.680 --> 29:58.440\nThere was one specific one that he kept abducting and he couldn't, he would rather break the\n\n29:58.440 --> 30:00.400\nlaw than go home without her.\n\n30:00.400 --> 30:03.320\nWait, did the mannequin keep escaping and go back to work?\n\n30:03.320 --> 30:05.800\nWhy did he have to do it three times?\n\n30:05.800 --> 30:10.400\nWell, as soon as there was no one around, she would turn into Kim Cottrell and, no,\n\n30:10.400 --> 30:13.960\nit was, I don't know, I think they would catch him because he was better at loving mannequins\n\n30:13.960 --> 30:14.960\nthan he was a criminal.\n\n30:14.960 --> 30:18.760\nI mean, I don't think he was, if he was a good criminal, if his passion was for crime,\n\n30:18.760 --> 30:20.160\nhe would have robbed a bank.\n\n30:20.160 --> 30:24.800\nHe was just so horny for this mannequin that he was breaking glass and he was getting caught\n\n30:24.800 --> 30:27.720\nbecause it's probably hard to abscond with those things.\n\n30:27.720 --> 30:31.000\nIsn't there a mannequin in Silver Lake or Los Feliz that you have a thing for?\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:32.000\nSay what?\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:33.560\nIsn't there a mannequin that you have a little crush on?\n\n30:33.560 --> 30:38.720\nWell, no, that's, that's McGathey's jealous of this, this, this mannequin on Hillhurst\n\n30:38.720 --> 30:44.160\nthat is a, there's a record store and there's a mannequin in the window that's like sitting\n\n30:44.160 --> 30:48.360\nin like a, like a reclining chair and she's listening to headphones and she has a red\n\n30:48.360 --> 30:49.360\nwig on.\n\n30:49.360 --> 30:55.400\nSo pretty, pretty sweet, but I, I, her bit is when we walk past it, she gets jealous\n\n30:55.400 --> 30:56.400\nof the mannequin.\n\n30:56.400 --> 30:57.400\nThat's her, that's her bit.\n\n30:57.400 --> 30:59.080\nAnd I'm over mannequins now, man.\n\n30:59.080 --> 31:02.120\nI, I, I love the, I love the real thing.\n\n31:02.120 --> 31:05.680\nI wasn't, I wasn't really into mannequins per se.\n\n31:05.680 --> 31:11.720\nI was, I was trying to become the most self-reliant man in the world.\n\n31:11.720 --> 31:16.560\nI was trying to, as long as we're here, as long as we're down at the bottom of this fucking\n\n31:16.560 --> 31:20.200\ncircle, I'll, I'll say it, I bought a real doll.\n\n31:20.200 --> 31:25.640\nOne of those things online, like it's like a $5,000, like, I think somebody just gasped\n\n31:25.640 --> 31:28.920\nand it's, it's pretty extreme shit.\n\n31:28.920 --> 31:32.840\nIt costs a lot of money and then they send you a giant crate and there's a fake woman\n\n31:32.840 --> 31:36.800\nin a box and then it's a sex doll.\n\n31:36.800 --> 31:37.800\nI bought one.\n\n31:37.800 --> 31:42.440\nRob Schrober and I didn't see you for three months and I was, when you did, you had a\n\n31:42.440 --> 31:44.360\nbig smile on your face.\n\n31:44.360 --> 31:50.040\nI was the best relationship that I had to date at that, at that time.\n\n31:50.040 --> 31:53.360\nI, I think it was an important thing because it was like, you talked to, sometimes you\n\n31:53.360 --> 31:55.720\ntalked to people and they're like, oh, I can't, I can't be in a relationship.\n\n31:55.720 --> 31:56.720\nI don't know.\n\n31:56.720 --> 31:59.320\nIt's, it has something to do with loss of control and that all this stuff.\n\n31:59.320 --> 32:03.720\nIt's like, you know, figure out who you are and what you want, like, get to the bottom\n\n32:03.720 --> 32:04.720\nof your circle.\n\n32:04.720 --> 32:09.320\nI think there would be less sexual crime and victimization and objectification of women\n\n32:09.320 --> 32:14.840\nif, if men would be a little more like indulgent with themselves of like what they really were\n\n32:14.840 --> 32:18.160\nthinking and wanting and, and, and so that they didn't have all this shame that had to\n\n32:18.160 --> 32:22.600\nget redirected and come out at weird times with the people that had the misfortune of\n\n32:22.600 --> 32:23.880\nrunning across their path.\n\n32:23.880 --> 32:28.760\nI, I, I looked at it like, like I was just trying to, I was, I was looking for the perfect\n\n32:28.760 --> 32:32.440\nback scratcher to scratch this itch because I was so, I was becoming so ashamed of myself\n\n32:32.440 --> 32:33.600\nfor dating women.\n\n32:33.600 --> 32:36.400\nIt's like, you know that this relationship isn't going to work.\n\n32:36.400 --> 32:37.800\nStop doing this.\n\n32:37.800 --> 32:39.400\nStop putting yourself out there.\n\n32:39.400 --> 32:42.920\nWhen you know that something is going to end with someone else being hurt and you do it\n\n32:42.920 --> 32:45.000\nanyway, then you're a bad person.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:46.000\nFigure your shit out.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.280\nWhat do you like?\n\n32:48.280 --> 32:56.000\nAnd the answer is anguora sweaters and nylon.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:59.120\nSo is that what you would wear?\n\n32:59.120 --> 33:00.120\nIs that what?\n\n33:00.120 --> 33:01.600\nIf you were a lady, is that what you would wear?\n\n33:01.600 --> 33:04.440\nYeah, I would do that too, but only at home.\n\n33:04.440 --> 33:05.440\nI wouldn't like go out in it.\n\n33:05.440 --> 33:08.360\nI would like roll around in the bed in it.\n\n33:08.360 --> 33:11.920\nIf I was a woman, I would just, yeah, I would just, I would just buy a bunch of outfits and\n\n33:11.920 --> 33:14.120\nroll around in the bed and look at myself in a mirror.\n\n33:14.120 --> 33:17.480\nBut I think that's all guys would think that because they'd be like, oh, I'm a woman.\n\n33:17.480 --> 33:19.480\nI'm a human playboy.\n\n33:19.480 --> 33:24.960\nI was dating a girl one time and I told her I liked stockings so she wore a fishnet stockings.\n\n33:24.960 --> 33:31.600\nAnd during the course of our interplay or intercourse, they, you know, they were torn\n\n33:31.600 --> 33:32.600\na little bit.\n\n33:32.600 --> 33:35.720\nSo the next morning she left my apartment and then she threw them out in the trash can\n\n33:35.720 --> 33:37.040\nby my bed.\n\n33:37.040 --> 33:40.400\nSo she left and went to work and I'm there and there's these stockings in there.\n\n33:40.400 --> 33:46.000\nAnd I had never put stockings on before and I thought, well, I thought, I'm into stockings.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.880\nLet's, let's, if I'm going to jump in the pool, let's touch the bottom.\n\n33:48.880 --> 33:49.880\nLet's find out.\n\n33:49.880 --> 33:56.120\nI'm not going to, I'm not going to not put them on and wonder if maybe that's where\n\n33:56.120 --> 33:57.120\nI'm going with this.\n\n33:57.120 --> 33:58.120\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n33:58.120 --> 34:02.920\nWell, if I'm Tim Curry from, you know, from Rocky Horror, well, why are you expressing\n\n34:02.920 --> 34:03.920\nall this?\n\n34:03.920 --> 34:04.920\nI'm not.\n\n34:04.920 --> 34:06.640\nJust Mayan wonderment at my, that's what I was doing.\n\n34:06.640 --> 34:08.680\nI was trying to figure out like, where does this lead?\n\n34:08.680 --> 34:09.680\nWhere does this end?\n\n34:09.680 --> 34:10.680\nWhere does this go?\n\n34:10.680 --> 34:15.160\nSo I put them on and, you know, it felt pretty good, you know, you put them on and feel kind\n\n34:15.160 --> 34:16.160\nof sexy.\n\n34:16.160 --> 34:17.320\nLike that's part of what stockings are about.\n\n34:17.320 --> 34:20.320\nI don't know why I like them so much, but I put them on, but you know, like I've got\n\n34:20.320 --> 34:22.360\nknobby knees and I've got hairy legs.\n\n34:22.360 --> 34:23.360\nIt didn't look good.\n\n34:23.360 --> 34:27.200\nI didn't, I didn't have sexy legs, but they felt kind of good putting on and like, I was\n\n34:27.200 --> 34:28.200\nlike, oh, that's cool.\n\n34:28.200 --> 34:29.280\nI like that.\n\n34:29.280 --> 34:32.080\nI like them better on women's legs and my own.\n\n34:32.080 --> 34:33.080\nSo I took them off.\n\n34:33.080 --> 34:36.360\nI, you know, I kind of, you know, I, I, I posed and primped and preened a little bit in front\n\n34:36.360 --> 34:37.360\nof the mirror.\n\n34:37.360 --> 34:40.600\nI gave, I gave, I gave with a full college try and then I took them off and I threw them\n\n34:40.600 --> 34:45.080\nout and I told my girlfriend, I said, you know, I, I pulled your stockings out of\n\n34:45.080 --> 34:46.080\nthe garbage.\n\n34:46.080 --> 34:47.080\nAnd I tried them on.\n\n34:47.080 --> 34:48.080\nI was like, God damn it.\n\n34:48.080 --> 34:49.080\nI knew it.\n\n34:49.080 --> 34:50.080\nI knew it.\n\n34:50.080 --> 34:51.080\nI was going to take it with me.\n\n34:51.080 --> 34:52.080\nI knew you'd put them on.\n\n34:52.080 --> 34:53.080\nI was like, I didn't.\n\n34:53.080 --> 34:54.080\nAll right.\n\n34:54.080 --> 34:55.080\nYeah.\n\n34:55.080 --> 34:56.080\nI didn't like it.\n\n34:56.080 --> 34:57.680\nUh, you know what?\n\n34:57.680 --> 35:03.160\nI did once that I've never told anybody except for, I never told anybody that's except for\n\n35:03.160 --> 35:06.520\nthe community writer's room because we had a, you know, I encouraged to kind of like\n\n35:06.520 --> 35:10.760\nwrite what you know, explore yourselves, like, like confess things and let's write episodes\n\n35:10.760 --> 35:15.760\nabout these things.\n\n35:15.760 --> 35:18.760\nUh, I, uh, okay.\n\n35:18.760 --> 35:21.760\nThe story, you could cut the tension with a knife in here right now.\n\n35:21.760 --> 35:26.320\nWell, yeah, because there's absolutely no, isn't that a refreshing thing though to not\n\n35:26.320 --> 35:30.760\nknow for sure that what I'm about to say isn't going to make your eyes fall out of your head.\n\n35:30.760 --> 35:36.160\nI like, you really don't know what I'm about to say because I have established that I might\n\n35:36.160 --> 35:37.160\nsay anything.\n\n35:37.160 --> 35:40.160\nI used to fuck a plastic lady, but here's something I never told anybody.\n\n35:40.160 --> 35:41.160\nYeah.\n\n35:41.160 --> 35:57.860\nUh, the story ends with a sharpie pen up my ass.\n\n35:57.860 --> 36:00.160\nIt begins innocently enough.\n\n36:00.160 --> 36:06.680\nTake us to the hero's journey of this.\n\n36:06.680 --> 36:08.800\nCan you make this Kenbellion part of that?\n\n36:08.800 --> 36:10.840\nIt begins in Milwaukee with Schrab.\n\n36:10.840 --> 36:15.880\nSchrab was my first, Schrab's the longest friend that I currently have that I, he's, the friend\n\n36:15.880 --> 36:18.680\nthat, all of the friends that I have now, Schrab is the guy I've known the longest.\n\n36:18.680 --> 36:19.680\nWe met in Milwaukee.\n\n36:19.680 --> 36:21.960\nI was 17 when I met Schrab.\n\n36:21.960 --> 36:28.680\nUh, Schrab, Schrab told me like once, you know, we started bonding about it.\n\n36:28.680 --> 36:32.680\nI was like, well, man, I really like jerking off.\n\n36:32.680 --> 36:34.160\nYeah, me too.\n\n36:34.160 --> 36:39.200\nYou know, we were, we were, we were friends, we, we communicated with each other.\n\n36:39.200 --> 36:41.520\nWe were, uh, talking about, we would, we would shower together.\n\n36:41.520 --> 36:42.520\nIt was, no, I'm kidding.\n\n36:42.520 --> 36:51.360\nUm, the, uh, once Schrab, Schrab said, do you know the thing about the prostate, right?\n\n36:51.360 --> 36:57.520\nAnd I said, no, what, what is the thing about the prostate?\n\n36:57.520 --> 37:00.800\nShould we get Rob up here to do his, well, we'll get him up in a second.\n\n37:00.800 --> 37:04.480\nI might have been to tell this butthole story, but, but, uh, as I guess this night just went\n\n37:04.480 --> 37:08.200\nto a weird black hole, like, uh, it was, it was about darkness.\n\n37:08.200 --> 37:09.200\nHe said it.\n\n37:09.200 --> 37:10.600\nYeah, I guess, but it's, it's kind of joyful.\n\n37:10.600 --> 37:15.560\nUm, I don't, I don't mind it so much if it's, it's a little relieving.\n\n37:15.560 --> 37:19.320\nUm, uh, I hope no one from CBS or Fox is here.\n\n37:19.320 --> 37:28.400\nUm, the, uh, you know, it's, you know, it's, you know, it's really weird is that, is that,\n\n37:28.400 --> 37:31.640\nis that, I don't, I don't know if he minds me saying this or just, Henry Kissinger's\n\n37:31.640 --> 37:33.640\nson is in the room.\n\n37:33.640 --> 37:34.640\nWhat?\n\n37:34.640 --> 37:35.640\nYeah.\n\n37:35.640 --> 37:36.640\nAll right.\n\n37:36.640 --> 37:37.640\nUh, okay.\n\n37:37.640 --> 37:46.640\nI, Rob goes, you know, when you're jerking off, you can't just pass by that.\n\n37:46.640 --> 37:51.520\nAll right, go on, go on.\n\n37:51.520 --> 37:57.400\nUh, you're about to tell a sharpie up the butt story to Henry Kissinger's son.\n\n37:57.400 --> 38:05.240\nThis Schrab, uh, tells you, yeah, when you're coming, you rub the, uh, you know, that what\n\n38:05.240 --> 38:09.680\nwe would call the taint, what we would come to call the taint, uh, when we achieved that\n\n38:09.680 --> 38:15.240\nkind of word power, Rob's like, you know, you rub that part, when you're coming, you,\n\n38:15.240 --> 38:16.680\nyou, it feels better.\n\n38:16.680 --> 38:17.680\nCome hard.\n\n38:17.680 --> 38:18.680\nWhy do you keep looking at me?\n\n38:18.680 --> 38:24.880\nWho am I supposed to look at the, uh, that girl like that, like, wait, wait, wait, that\n\n38:24.880 --> 38:31.040\nfella, who, who, who should I look at while you chose me for a certain, well, I thought\n\n38:31.040 --> 38:33.040\nI could trust you.\n\n38:33.040 --> 38:39.840\nUh, I'll just stare in the lights, look at me while you tell the story.\n\n38:39.840 --> 38:43.800\nSo Rob said, when you're coming, you know, you, you, you rub the, you rub the, uh, little,\n\n38:43.800 --> 38:49.200\nthe area between your, uh, your, your, your butt and your balls.\n\n38:49.200 --> 38:50.600\nIt's, uh, it's a thing.\n\n38:50.600 --> 38:51.880\nIt's like, it feels a little better.\n\n38:51.880 --> 38:54.200\nIt's a, you're still, and I was like, I wonder why that is.\n\n38:54.200 --> 38:55.200\nWhat is that?\n\n38:55.200 --> 38:56.200\nIt was a magic button there.\n\n38:56.200 --> 39:02.240\nI did a little research at the local library, actually, actually, I just happened upon it.\n\n39:02.240 --> 39:05.480\nI think it was like in a, in a, like a penthouse magazine or something.\n\n39:05.480 --> 39:11.560\nI said, this is a pre-internet world of, of, of delightful, uh, periodical literature.\n\n39:11.560 --> 39:16.520\nUm, and, uh, there was some guy wrote in a letter to playboy or penthouse or something\n\n39:16.520 --> 39:22.920\nand said, dear playboy, I, my girlfriend was, uh, uh, uh, uh, pleasuring me.\n\n39:22.920 --> 39:26.680\nAnd she started, she rubbed the area that Schrab was talking about.\n\n39:26.680 --> 39:27.680\nRob Schrab.\n\n39:27.680 --> 39:28.680\nRob Schrab.\n\n39:28.680 --> 39:39.680\nThat is a great direct to video movie.\n\n39:39.680 --> 39:44.040\nUh, have you seen Tate Master 2?\n\n39:44.040 --> 39:45.040\nOh yeah.\n\n39:45.040 --> 39:50.480\nI, I, I didn't like it, but I heard Tate Master 3 is going to pretend Tate Master 2 didn't\n\n39:50.480 --> 39:51.480\nhappen.\n\n39:51.480 --> 39:54.880\nIt's so cool because I didn't like learning that Tate Master was an alien.\n\n39:54.880 --> 40:00.120\nI, I thought that he was a master of Tates that was earthbound and, uh, and, and could,\n\n40:00.120 --> 40:02.560\nand could speak to them and see through their eyes.\n\n40:02.560 --> 40:05.360\nUm, I've got that poster.\n\n40:05.360 --> 40:06.360\nIt's amazing.\n\n40:06.360 --> 40:10.280\nThis thing was interesting at Mark Singer, who was in Beastmaster.\n\n40:10.280 --> 40:12.680\nHe had a, uh, have you watched Beastmaster?\n\n40:12.680 --> 40:18.240\nHe has a very visible, very clear, uh, uh, uh, what is it, it's a smallpox vaccination\n\n40:18.240 --> 40:19.240\nthing.\n\n40:19.240 --> 40:22.760\nI just think that's interesting because it's like, he's the Beastmaster.\n\n40:22.760 --> 40:26.440\nHe's, he's even a master of, of, of microscopic beasts.\n\n40:26.440 --> 40:31.040\nHe, before anyone in this world had, uh, had vaccinations.\n\n40:31.040 --> 40:32.040\nHe did.\n\n40:32.040 --> 40:33.400\nUh, uh, all right.\n\n40:33.400 --> 40:36.960\nYou 25 year old fuckers.\n\n40:36.960 --> 40:38.800\nMaybe educate yourselves a little bit.\n\n40:38.800 --> 40:41.280\nI don't want us to go down that road again.\n\n40:41.280 --> 40:43.280\nWho is Eddie Brackell?\n\n40:43.280 --> 40:49.760\nUh, what's aerobics?\n\n40:49.760 --> 40:50.760\nAll right.\n\n40:50.760 --> 40:52.480\nSo Rob Schrab is rubbing your chain.\n\n40:52.480 --> 40:57.320\nThat's, that's not, that's, that's why, that's, that's why you left off.\n\n40:57.320 --> 41:01.320\nI was, I was, it was that too.\n\n41:01.320 --> 41:06.480\nI read a letter in a magazine with the goddess.\n\n41:06.480 --> 41:14.640\nI read a letter in a magazine where a guy wrote into a magazine and said, uh, I, I,\n\n41:14.640 --> 41:16.440\nmy girlfriend did this thing.\n\n41:16.440 --> 41:19.960\nShe rubbed this spot and it, and something amazing happened.\n\n41:19.960 --> 41:27.080\nUh, what can you explain on the doctor sex or whoever was writing into said, uh, oh,\n\n41:27.080 --> 41:29.720\nshe's stimulating your prostate gland.\n\n41:29.720 --> 41:32.280\nUh, uh, that's what's happening.\n\n41:32.280 --> 41:34.360\nSome people choose to do it internally.\n\n41:34.360 --> 41:38.240\nUh, that's why people stick stuff up their butt sometime.\n\n41:38.240 --> 41:40.440\nThat's what, that's the same thing.\n\n41:40.440 --> 41:47.040\nAnd so I thought, huh, like you with the fishnets, what, what am I going to die?\n\n41:47.040 --> 41:50.640\nNot having a, what if, what if, how do you know?\n\n41:50.640 --> 41:53.280\nI mean, what do you, what if it's my favorite thing?\n\n41:53.280 --> 41:56.680\nWhat if I turned into the guy that loves, why did you climb that mountain?\n\n41:56.680 --> 41:57.680\nBecause it was there.\n\n41:57.680 --> 41:58.680\nYou hear about it sometimes.\n\n41:58.680 --> 42:02.600\nYou hear about guys liking the, liking stuff in their, uh, their hoo-ha.\n\n42:02.600 --> 42:11.920\nSo I thought maybe I'm going to, so I, so at one point I'm, I'm going, I'm, I'm, I'm\n\n42:11.920 --> 42:22.120\nsitting down for a personal session, uh, and, uh, and, and, and, and I, and, and I think\n\n42:22.120 --> 42:27.600\nto myself, uh, uh, well, maybe, maybe this is the time I try to, I'll try to, I'll try\n\n42:27.600 --> 42:32.280\nto put something in there and see if it's like magic, you know, see if a genie comes\n\n42:32.280 --> 42:41.080\nout, um, go on.\n\n42:41.080 --> 42:48.040\nSo I looked around my house because I did, I thought, well, I'm not going to put my finger\n\n42:48.040 --> 42:49.040\nin there.\n\n42:49.040 --> 42:50.040\nYeah.\n\n42:50.040 --> 42:55.840\nBecause it's, because it's a butt, that's gross.\n\n42:55.840 --> 43:00.120\nI don't want my, I don't want poopies on my finger.\n\n43:00.120 --> 43:01.120\nThis is for the ladies.\n\n43:01.120 --> 43:05.080\nSo I'm like, well, it's for an object time.\n\n43:05.080 --> 43:15.040\nSo I, I look around and I'm like, I landed on a, uh, Sharpie pen, not, not the cap end,\n\n43:15.040 --> 43:18.320\nbut the, just the, because the, there's the regular, just smooth, white end.\n\n43:18.320 --> 43:19.320\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\n43:19.320 --> 43:24.920\nI was like, well, this is a, this is a, this is a good starter, you know, like, start,\n\n43:24.920 --> 43:25.920\nstart slow.\n\n43:25.920 --> 43:31.080\nMaybe I'll end up putting a thermos up there, but, uh, let's, let's find out.\n\n43:31.080 --> 43:41.920\nUh, and so I, you know, the end of the story is I have a Sharpie pen stuck up my ass and\n\n43:41.920 --> 43:45.640\nI came and it wasn't that big a deal.\n\n43:45.640 --> 43:48.600\nMe, it might have been a little better.\n\n43:48.600 --> 43:53.520\nI mean, I can't remember, but what I do remember very clearly is there's a thing with guys,\n\n43:53.520 --> 43:58.040\num, when God, this is something that's very amazing to me.\n\n43:58.040 --> 44:04.720\nWhen guys have an orgasm, it is instantaneous, like whatever was in your bloodstream, whatever\n\n44:04.720 --> 44:12.440\nwas in your brain that was making you sexually pro, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, excited.\n\n44:12.440 --> 44:15.560\nLike it is literally in an instant.\n\n44:15.560 --> 44:19.920\nLike the moment of your orgasm, the guy, it's like the thought of sex is like mowing\n\n44:19.920 --> 44:20.920\nthe lawn.\n\n44:20.920 --> 44:24.200\nIt says it doesn't, it's everything goes away completely.\n\n44:24.200 --> 44:28.920\nYou go from being like Dr. Detroit to being Dan Acheride.\n\n44:28.920 --> 44:29.920\nWow.\n\n44:29.920 --> 44:30.920\nFuck you guys.\n\n44:30.920 --> 44:33.920\nJust, just rent some shit.\n\n44:33.920 --> 44:41.720\nDr. Detroit, now I'm turned on again.\n\n44:41.720 --> 44:47.320\nYou go from being Mr. Hyde to back to having a PhD again, uh, as soon as you orgasm.\n\n44:47.320 --> 44:54.920\nSo I came and I had a pin up my ass.\n\n44:54.920 --> 44:57.160\nI was just, that is the sweetest taboo.\n\n44:57.160 --> 44:58.160\nThank you sir.\n\n44:58.160 --> 45:10.200\nUh, I, I, I, there's nothing, I think you, you don't want, like, like you'll do almost\n\n45:10.200 --> 45:14.480\nanything when you're in that zone, like you'll, you'll, you're, you're, you're, it's, it does\n\n45:14.480 --> 45:18.800\nthings to your mind and your, and your body, but then when it's all over, you don't want\n\n45:18.800 --> 45:23.760\nany props involved that, that, that are going to like take time and effort to deal with.\n\n45:23.760 --> 45:29.640\nLike I, I was a man who, you know, I was back to being a normal stockbroker.\n\n45:29.640 --> 45:33.560\nYou know, just, I wasn't ever really a stockbroker.\n\n45:33.560 --> 45:34.880\nThat would be embarrassing.\n\n45:34.880 --> 45:39.160\nUh, I had a pin up my ass and I had to pull it out.\n\n45:39.160 --> 45:40.160\nYeah.\n\n45:40.160 --> 45:44.160\nWell, wouldn't, wouldn't you rather I did, uh, so, so,\n\n45:44.160 --> 45:48.440\nSo you didn't, you didn't want me to like pull it out now and go, and here it is.\n\n45:48.440 --> 45:49.640\nSo when you come up after the show,\n\n45:49.640 --> 45:51.320\nLike a golden railroad spike,\n\n45:51.320 --> 45:55.520\nWell, after the show down and be signing autographs and pictures.\n\n45:55.520 --> 45:56.600\nYes.\n\n45:56.600 --> 46:00.640\nI told the community writer's room that and there was no end of Sharpie jokes.\n\n46:00.640 --> 46:01.640\nUh, yeah.\n\n46:01.640 --> 46:04.480\nWell, do you want, here, here's some things on the docket for tonight.\n\n46:04.480 --> 46:05.480\nAll right.\n\n46:05.480 --> 46:07.600\nWe got to have Spencer come up, our dungeon master.\n\n46:07.600 --> 46:08.600\nOh fuck yeah.\n\n46:08.600 --> 46:12.240\nWe're going to have Spencer come up and he's going to just talk to us, you and me.\n\n46:12.240 --> 46:14.360\nSpencer whom we met last, uh, last week.\n\n46:14.360 --> 46:15.360\nYes.\n\n46:15.360 --> 46:19.000\nI said, I brought a dungeon master up on stage who volunteered to talk to us about Dungeons\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:24.800\nand Dragons and, and Spencer's going to come up, talk to us a little bit, uh, about, about\n\n46:24.800 --> 46:29.040\nthe kinds of characters we might like to play in a Dungeons and Dragons game.\n\n46:29.040 --> 46:33.960\nAnd then he'll, he'll take his seat, uh, there, there's a lovely commemorative Sharpie\n\n46:33.960 --> 46:41.800\npen under it for him, uh, he, he, he, he, and then, and then next week, then he'll,\n\n46:41.800 --> 46:46.120\nI get, you know, present our characters to us and that'll be another, you know, I gotta\n\n46:46.120 --> 46:50.000\ntry to, it'll, it's, it's, it's a weekly step-by-step baby steps.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:51.560\nI don't know where that's going to go.\n\n46:51.560 --> 46:56.960\nAre we going to end up playing Dungeons and Dragons on the, on the podcast here at Harmontown?\n\n46:56.960 --> 47:01.600\nWill we, three weeks from now, will we have a table up on stage and we'll just do a little\n\n47:01.600 --> 47:06.680\nsegment where we do a little, little, little baby chapter of an adventure with a dungeon\n\n47:06.680 --> 47:12.680\nmaster, will Spencer be our dungeon master or, or having rolled our characters, you know,\n\n47:12.680 --> 47:15.320\nwill he abdicate to that throne?\n\n47:15.320 --> 47:20.880\nWill we audition, as I suggested, we might other dungeon masters and each week and see\n\n47:20.880 --> 47:22.560\nhow they, how they work for us.\n\n47:22.560 --> 47:23.560\nSo I don't know.\n\n47:23.560 --> 47:24.840\nI don't plan that far ahead.\n\n47:24.840 --> 47:26.320\nI'm a bad planner.\n\n47:26.320 --> 47:29.240\nI stick pens up my ass.\n\n47:29.240 --> 47:34.720\nThat was not a guy who is thinking about Wednesday on Monday.\n\n47:34.720 --> 47:49.160\nThat's a, that is a man who deems his Carpe's new, please, please welcome to the stage for\n\n47:49.160 --> 47:53.560\nthose of you who are here last week or listen to it last week, sorry, I totally blue balled\n\n47:53.560 --> 47:54.960\nyour applause there.\n\n47:54.960 --> 47:57.240\nI'm sorry about that.\n\n47:57.240 --> 48:02.760\nBut for those of you here last week or listening to it last week, we, you know, I said I want\n\n48:02.760 --> 48:07.600\nto play Dungeons and Dragons on the podcast, I think, I want to, somebody needs to roll\n\n48:07.600 --> 48:08.600\ncharacters for us.\n\n48:08.600 --> 48:13.120\nWe, I needed immediately, I'm so out of touch with the world of Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n48:13.120 --> 48:19.560\nI haven't, I, I, I, I, the books I own are from 89 and thank you for applause for a year.\n\n48:19.560 --> 48:26.840\nIt was applause for a year, someone applauded a year.\n\n48:26.840 --> 48:28.040\nSo we brought this guy up.\n\n48:28.040 --> 48:30.920\nHe shot his hand up when I said, who knows anything about Dungeons and Dragons?\n\n48:30.920 --> 48:32.720\nWho's a dungeon master?\n\n48:32.720 --> 48:37.000\nSpencer raised his hand coming up and, and so I talked to him after the show.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:40.320\nI think we should edit all this out because I'm explaining a bunch of redundant bullshit.\n\n48:40.320 --> 48:46.360\nBut let's, let's, let's bring our character, the guy who's going to create Jeff and I's\n\n48:46.360 --> 48:49.400\nfirst level Dungeons and Dragons characters to the stage.\n\n48:49.400 --> 48:52.400\nIt's Spencer, everybody, bring him up.\n\n48:52.400 --> 48:54.400\nHow's it going?\n\n48:54.400 --> 48:57.400\nHere he is.\n\n48:57.400 --> 49:07.760\nNow at risk, Jeff, you're like, for those listening, do we want to describe Spencer?\n\n49:07.760 --> 49:09.960\nHe really does scream dungeon master.\n\n49:09.960 --> 49:14.120\nI would say, what, six, five, four, how tall are you?\n\n49:14.120 --> 49:15.120\nSix, four.\n\n49:15.120 --> 49:16.120\nSix, four.\n\n49:16.120 --> 49:17.120\nSix, four.\n\n49:17.120 --> 49:27.360\nBearded, hair, pretty long, metallica length hair, lower, lower scapula length.\n\n49:27.360 --> 49:33.920\nHe's a, he's bespectacled and kind of like, you know, intellectual small glasses.\n\n49:33.920 --> 49:37.800\nHe's got a, a t-shirt, some plaid shorts, he's very casually dressed.\n\n49:37.800 --> 49:44.240\nI, you know, I, I would have pictured a top hat and a cloak, but I mean, but it's a podcast.\n\n49:44.240 --> 49:45.920\nThere's different kinds of dungeon master.\n\n49:45.920 --> 49:48.880\nI mean, this is, this is the, well edit that part out.\n\n49:48.880 --> 49:52.560\nHe's a, he has a leather top hat and goggles on, on the, the goggles aren't in his face.\n\n49:52.560 --> 49:54.120\nThey're on the hat.\n\n49:54.120 --> 50:00.000\nAnd he's wearing a jacket that goes down to the floor and there's 18 buckles on it.\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:05.240\nHe has pockets on each arm, each of which are clearly carrying a weapon.\n\n50:05.240 --> 50:08.960\nAnd he has a dice satchel.\n\n50:08.960 --> 50:09.960\nThat's not true.\n\n50:09.960 --> 50:11.440\nNo, we want, I want people to really know.\n\n50:11.440 --> 50:13.440\nHe's a very casual dungeon master.\n\n50:13.440 --> 50:25.760\nHe looks like a, a, a, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's casual Friday at the Norse Pillager village\n\n50:25.760 --> 50:26.760\non the Viking ship.\n\n50:26.760 --> 50:27.760\nYes.\n\n50:27.760 --> 50:28.760\nIt's, it's, it's biz casual.\n\n50:28.760 --> 50:29.760\nIt's fried during the Norman invasion.\n\n50:29.760 --> 50:34.760\nIt's, it's, it's, it's, it's laundry day on Eric the Red's boat.\n\n50:34.760 --> 50:35.760\nRight.\n\n50:35.760 --> 50:39.280\nIt's a, it's a big, big bushy beard, six foot four.\n\n50:39.280 --> 50:44.000\nOnly of the month, uh, 1524.\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:45.000\nOkay.\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:46.000\nAll right.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:49.800\nSo Spencer, uh, the, the, the, the, the, all our, our goal right now for this conversation,\n\n50:49.800 --> 50:53.920\nall we want to do is just, we want to talk about the kinds of characters Jeff and I would\n\n50:53.920 --> 50:54.920\nlike to play.\n\n50:54.920 --> 50:59.320\nNow there's not a lot of like two person campaigns is there in Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n50:59.320 --> 51:00.320\nThat's not really a common thing.\n\n51:00.320 --> 51:03.160\nI don't think it's too common, but it does end up happening.\n\n51:03.160 --> 51:04.160\nYeah.\n\n51:04.160 --> 51:09.440\nWell, it's, it's, it's, sometimes you don't have any friends.\n\n51:09.440 --> 51:10.440\nYeah.\n\n51:10.440 --> 51:11.440\nExactly.\n\n51:11.440 --> 51:17.320\nIf there's one contingency, we have the role playing ilk, uh, have to prepare ourselves\n\n51:17.320 --> 51:20.600\nfor, it's, uh, it's less people showing up than we thought.\n\n51:20.600 --> 51:25.000\nCan I just say like two pens and a real doll ago, I was like, they're going to think I'm\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:26.000\na loser.\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:27.000\nYou're welcome.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:28.000\nYou're welcome.\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:33.000\nYou're like Carrie Grant up here.\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:38.680\nUh, yeah, I am not a, uh, yeah, I am, uh, I am a nerd's nerd.\n\n51:38.680 --> 51:41.120\nHave you ever tried on stockings and put a pen in your butt Spencer?\n\n51:41.120 --> 51:43.480\nCan't say that I have, but I'm interested.\n\n51:43.480 --> 51:44.480\nYeah.\n\n51:44.480 --> 51:47.480\nWhat a square.\n\n51:47.480 --> 51:49.600\nUh, all right.\n\n51:49.600 --> 51:50.600\nSo yeah.\n\n51:50.600 --> 51:51.600\nSo it happens.\n\n51:51.600 --> 51:57.760\nI think that, uh, uh, when, because I know that in creating, uh, parties of Dungeons and\n\n51:57.760 --> 52:00.160\nDragons characters, what you want is a kind of balance.\n\n52:00.160 --> 52:06.120\nLike it's possible for Jeff and I to both be magic users or, but, and both, or both\n\n52:06.120 --> 52:10.800\nbe fighters, but we'd probably want to, we probably want to balance ourselves a little.\n\n52:10.800 --> 52:11.800\nYeah.\n\n52:11.800 --> 52:19.160\nYou want some like, uh, some heavy meat to take some damage and, uh, some, yeah, you\n\n52:19.160 --> 52:21.160\nwant to balance.\n\n52:21.160 --> 52:22.160\nSweetest taboo.\n\n52:22.160 --> 52:24.920\nUh, I've never played this.\n\n52:24.920 --> 52:27.280\nI have no idea what either of you two are talking about.\n\n52:27.280 --> 52:28.280\nAll right.\n\n52:28.280 --> 52:29.280\nWell, let's walk them through it Spencer.\n\n52:29.280 --> 52:32.800\nSo if I'm assuming that the third edition of Dungeons and Dragons has a change, has\n\n52:32.800 --> 52:38.480\na change to the fundamentals of phrase was like, there's class, class is like occupation.\n\n52:38.480 --> 52:39.480\nThere's fighter.\n\n52:39.480 --> 52:40.480\nOh, you, you listen.\n\n52:40.480 --> 52:41.480\nAll right.\n\n52:41.480 --> 52:42.480\nYeah.\n\n52:42.480 --> 52:43.920\nSo mostly it's just like classes.\n\n52:43.920 --> 52:46.800\nThere's the barbarian, which is, you know, a barbarian.\n\n52:46.800 --> 52:51.740\nThere's a bard which tells magical stories and can cast spells and cause people to double\n\n52:51.740 --> 52:54.200\nover and painful laughter.\n\n52:54.200 --> 52:56.040\nThere's a clerics.\n\n52:56.040 --> 52:58.320\nThey channel their power of their gods.\n\n52:58.320 --> 53:00.640\nLet's see, uh, druids.\n\n53:00.640 --> 53:06.640\nThey're kind of like hippies, but with magic, um, you got fighters, they have big swords\n\n53:06.640 --> 53:07.640\nand whatnot.\n\n53:07.640 --> 53:09.640\nYou got, uh, let's see here.\n\n53:09.640 --> 53:10.640\nAll right.\n\n53:10.640 --> 53:12.600\nYou got monks, which are kind of like martial artists.\n\n53:12.600 --> 53:14.360\nYou like Jackie Chan kind of people.\n\n53:14.360 --> 53:20.000\nYou got your rain, no, you got your paladins, which, you know, they smite evil in the name\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.800\nof their gods and are usually jerks.\n\n53:22.800 --> 53:25.320\nThere's, uh, Rangers.\n\n53:25.320 --> 53:31.120\nI think it's hand shot up when he heard that description.\n\n53:31.120 --> 53:34.000\nYou got the Rangers, which is like Lego loss from Lord of the Rings.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:35.000\nHe's got a bow.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.840\nHe uses two swords, you know, that sort of thing.\n\n53:37.840 --> 53:40.200\nUm, and they're kind of nature experts.\n\n53:40.200 --> 53:41.200\nYeah.\n\n53:41.200 --> 53:42.200\nThey got, they can hunt there.\n\n53:42.200 --> 53:46.600\nThey can, uh, have beast pets sort of thing like Beastmaster.\n\n53:46.600 --> 53:47.800\nYeah.\n\n53:47.800 --> 53:49.800\nLike Taintmaster.\n\n53:49.800 --> 53:51.800\nAlmost.\n\n53:51.800 --> 53:55.280\nUh, wait, is that, uh, are those thieves?\n\n53:55.280 --> 53:56.280\nThieves and assassins?\n\n53:56.280 --> 53:57.280\nYeah.\n\n53:57.280 --> 53:58.280\nThere's thieves, which are rogues.\n\n53:58.280 --> 54:02.520\nThey can be like assassins or just thieves, you know, stealing stuff or sneaking on high\n\n54:02.520 --> 54:03.520\nledges.\n\n54:03.520 --> 54:07.880\nI'm going to go for, um, what's a barbarian do?\n\n54:07.880 --> 54:12.280\nBarbarians fly into dangerous rages in which they shrug off even the fiercest of damage.\n\n54:12.280 --> 54:13.280\nI'll take

arrows.\n\n55:35.960 --> 55:39.200\nThey're taught what some people think elves are a little shrimpy, shrimpy, shrimpy people.\n\n55:39.200 --> 55:40.200\nI make cookies.\n\n55:40.200 --> 55:41.200\nYeah.\n\n55:41.200 --> 55:42.800\nLike, like, this isn't a Kepler elf.\n\n55:42.800 --> 55:43.800\nIs there?\n\n55:43.800 --> 55:44.800\nWell, actually, yeah.\n\n55:44.800 --> 55:45.800\nLord of the Rings.\n\n55:45.800 --> 55:47.800\nNow everybody knows that it's a Orlando bloom.\n\n55:47.800 --> 55:48.800\nOkay.\n\n55:48.800 --> 55:55.200\nYou got, uh, half elves, which

the game.\n\n55:59.520 --> 56:00.520\nOkay.\n\n56:00.520 --> 56:01.520\nDon't hate the role-player.\n\n56:01.520 --> 56:02.520\nUh, okay.\n\n56:02.520 --> 56:03.520\nUh.\n\n56:03.520 --> 56:11.640\nYou got half elf, or no, halflings, which are rarely, really short people.\n\n56:11.640 --> 56:20.960\nKind of like toddlers, if they looked old.\n\n56:20.960 --> 56:25.240\nI think I'll, I

is going to beat your ass.\n\n56:32.640 --> 56:34.880\nAm I a gnome or a dwarf?\n\n56:34.880 --> 56:35.880\nYou're probably a gnome.\n\n56:35.880 --> 56:37.840\nYou could be a dwarf, but that's less hilarious.\n\n56:37.840 --> 56:38.840\nNo.\n\n56:38.840 --> 56:39.840\nNope, it is.\n\n56:39.840 --> 56:44.000\nAnd the, and the, and the rest of it, you know, unless we have any specific requests\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:47.200\nthat we want to talk about, like I've got concepts that we want to, because part of\n\n56:47.200 --> 56:51.600\nyour job now as a dungeon master, from what I understand is, he's going to go roll our\n\n56:51.600 --> 56:52.600\ncharacters.\n\n56:52.600 --> 56:53.600\nThis is a comedy show.\n\n56:53.600 --> 56:57.800\nSo some of it involves actual die-rolling, like, like, you know, like, like generating\n\n56:57.800 --> 57:01.520\nour attributes, which are strength, intelligence, wisdom, charisma, I'm assuming.\n\n57:01.520 --> 57:02.520\nStop me if I'm wrong.\n\n57:02.520 --> 57:03.520\nNo, those are all right.\n\n57:03.520 --> 57:04.520\nYeah.\n\n57:04.520 --> 57:05.520\nUh, okay.\n\n57:05.520 --> 57:10.080\nAnd we could, we could turn you loose now and you could, you could, you could roll as first-level\n\n57:10.080 --> 57:11.080\ncharacters.\n\n57:11.080 --> 57:12.080\nWe're going to be very weak.\n\n57:12.080 --> 57:14.640\nUh, and we're going to have a kind of, and then, and then we'll, you'll present them\n\n57:14.640 --> 57:15.640\nto us next week.\n\n57:15.640 --> 57:16.640\nYou go, here's your character.\n\n57:16.640 --> 57:19.800\nSo maybe, maybe we, maybe we should come up with our names, Jeff.\n\n57:19.800 --> 57:21.960\nI'm going to guess you're going to be Mission Nightblade.\n\n57:21.960 --> 57:25.080\nNo, I'm not, because I'm going to be a magic user.\n\n57:25.080 --> 57:30.200\nI'm, I'm, I'm, I'll come up with my name, uh, right now.\n\n57:30.200 --> 57:31.200\nNo.\n\n57:31.200 --> 57:34.920\nNo, no, what do you think Spencer, do we come up with them now or do we, do we, do you come\n\n57:34.920 --> 57:36.720\nback with these characters that are nameless?\n\n57:36.720 --> 57:37.920\nYou should come up with a name now.\n\n57:37.920 --> 57:38.920\nYou know how about this?\n\n57:38.920 --> 57:41.800\nUh, let's let the audience tonight name our characters.\n\n57:41.800 -->

story or no?\n\n59:50.480 --> 59:52.480\nWell, I don't think, I just don't think it's time.\n\n59:52.480 --> 59:56.480\nRob washed his butt too much and, uh, all right, Schrab, come up.\n\n59:56.480 --> 59:57.480\nOkay.\n\n59:57.480 --> 59:59.480\nHow can you, can you do the, yeah.\n\n59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.480\nYou want the short version?\n\n01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.480\nYeah.\n\n01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.480\nYeah.\n\n01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.480\nWhat's the short version?\n\n01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480\nOh gosh.\n\n01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.480\nI don't remember to remind me how did, how did this all get started?\n\n01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.480\nBy the way.\n\n01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.480\nIt all got city seats in the building.\n\n01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.480\nI know.\n\n01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.480\nI don't know why they put chairs.\n\n01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.480\nThese are reserved.\n\n01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.480\nYeah.\n\n01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.480\nThese are reserved.\n\n01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.280\nWell, also that's part of that's my fault.\n\n01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.280\nRob's describing.\n\n01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.480\nThis is, this is your view the entire time.\n\n01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.480\nYeah.\n\n01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.480\nThe entire stage right here at the show, uh, audience left.\n\n01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.480\nYou look at the back of Dan's head most of the show.\n\n01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.480\nYeah.\n\n01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480\nWhat is that?\n\n01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.480\nIt's my fault.\n\n01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.480\nIt's also my fault because I tend to talk to Jeff because I'm insecure.\n\n01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.480\nThat's okay.\n\n01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.480\nAnd so then you're looking at my tight pass.\n\n01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.480\nAlso, uh, at everything is, uh, terror, uh, everything is festival.\n\n01:00:36.480 -->

hilarious.\n\n01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:48.480\nIt's, it's important to mention that our hero and mentor Joel Hodgson from Mystery Science\n\n01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:55.480\nTheater is here.\n\n01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:00.480\nJoel Hodgson, truly a God among, among nerds and even some regular people.\n\n01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:06.480\nUh, Joel, Joel was when, when, when, when I moved to LA, we were strangers in a strange\n\n01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.480\nland.\n\n01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.480\nWe had no idea what we were doing.\n\n01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.480\nAnd this other guy from the Midwest who we worshiped, uh, when we were in Milwaukee because\n\n01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480\nwe loved his show.\n\n01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.480\nUh, you know, he, he, he was out here in LA too and he showed, you know, he was a big\n\n01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.480\npart of making us comfortable out here, you know, explaining to us like how disgusting\n\n01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.480\nhe could be out here and, and preparing us for that.\n\n01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.480\nUh, and he's a, he's a good standup guy.\n\n01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.480\nHe's a great guy.\n\n01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.480\nI miss him like the Dickens.\n\n01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.480\nMissing, missing, missing Dickens.\n\n01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.480\nUh, anyways.\n\n01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.480\nYou mean it's, you make the whole taint thing sound like we were like some serious chuck\n\n01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.480\nand buck shit.\n\n01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.480\nHey man, you know what you got to do?\n\n01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:48.480\nYou got to rub that taint when you're jerking off, it's not like that at all.\n\n01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.480\nWe were, I would be Chuck, right?\n\n01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480\nRight?\n\n01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.480\nThat's important to you.\n\n01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.480\nThat's really petty.\n\n01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.480\nThat's really petty, Rob.\n\n01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.480\nHe's thinner, right?\n\n01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480\nHe's thinner.\n\n01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.480\nAll right.\n\n01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.480\nBut what, what, I mean, there's several chapter decades.\n\n01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.480\nStop me when you want to take over.\n\n01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.480\nOkay.\n\n01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.480\nThat at some point in his life became obsessive about cleaning his anus.\n\n01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.480\nThat was, I, I, that, that, that was an uncharismatic.\n\n01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.480\nIs that a really, is that a really a bad thing?\n\n01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.480\nBut no, no, of course not.\n\n01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.480\nIt's what's bad is how late in life I became upset.\n\n01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.480\nYou decided that you weren't.\n\n01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.480\nYeah.\n\n01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:30.480\nThat you would, I don't think my mom potty trained me properly because I remember, I\n\n01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.480\nremember, I remember like, I don't know what it was.\n\n01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:40.480\nI don't know if my mom said it, but I got it in my head that all you had to do is wipe\n\n01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.480\nthree times.\n\n01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.480\nAll the sealant if you want me.\n\n01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.480\nPress out the pipe.\n\n01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.480\nIf you wipe three times, I was never taught to look at the tissue.\n\n01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.480\nI was a kid.\n\n01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.480\nIt was like wipe three times.\n\n01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.480\nAll the sealant if you want me.\n\n01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.480\nAnd then, and then flush.\n\n01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:05.480\nAnd the toilet paper magically makes the poop go away.\n\n01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:10.480\nWhich is not true if you've ever tried to get a peanut butter off the carpet.\n\n01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:14.480\nSo then you felt it at a time and you.\n\n01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.480\nDon't take three wipes.\n\n01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.480\nWhat, what, what?\n\n01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.480\nDon't take three wipes.\n\n01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.480\nWhat goes on in Wisconsin by the way.\n\n01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.480\nHe is right.\n\n01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.480\nHe's crazy over there.\n\n01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.480\nSo, but that's, that's the, that's the setup is that.\n\n01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.480\nSo you started, what you started doing is you started like really kind of.\n\n01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.480\nGoing for it.\n\n01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.480\nYeah.\n\n01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.480\nLike really washing it.\n\n01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.480\nMaking up for 20 years because I.\n\n01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480\nGod.\n\n01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.480\nI can't, I can't tell why.\n\n01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.480\nYes, I can.\n\n01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.480\nOkay.\n\n01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.480\nSo as a joke.\n\n01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.480\nOh man.\n\n01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.480\nI'm so sorry, honey.\n\n01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.480\nI'm so.\n\n01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.480\nYou, you, she's married to you now.\n\n01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480\nShe can't do anything.\n\n01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.480\nI want to stay married.\n\n01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.480\nShe's not going to divorce you for.\n\n01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.480\nOh God.\n\n01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.480\nTelling how you clean your.\n\n01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:02.480\nSo anyway, as a joke back in the dead ale wives days, when we would show our balls and our\n\n01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.480\ndicks and stuff like that, it was the funniest thing in the world.\n\n01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.480\nWe thought we invented that.\n\n01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.480\nYeah.\n\n01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:15.480\nI dropped my pants and I, I don't know, grabbed a towel and I wiped it and it was shockingly\n\n01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.480\ndirt.\n\n01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.480\nIt's soiled.\n\n01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:24.480\nAnd our, everybody goes, nobody's more embarrassed than I am.\n\n01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:30.480\nAnd then our good friend, Sean McKenna, like looked at me who would pull his dick out and\n\n01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.480\npee on your shoe as a joke and stuff.\n\n01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.480\nLook at me.\n\n01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.480\nYeah.\n\n01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.480\nSean had a bit.\n\n01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.480\nHe would do called the Star Wars trilogy where he would do, he would do three things with\n\n01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.480\nhis penis.\n\n01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.480\nLike, like he would do it.\n\n01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.480\nHe would make it a lightsaber with a pen light and he would pretend it was Jabba the hut\n\n01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:51.480\nby making his ballsack talk and then for an empire, he would, he, he, he would, he would\n\n01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.480\ntuck it into its own force.\n\n01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:59.480\nAnd then pretend it was the, the, the, the big reptile creature trying to swallow the\n\n01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:04.480\nMillennium Falcon as the, his pinky was the Millennium Falcon as it flew away and it would,\n\n01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.480\nhe would, he would let his package like unpackage.\n\n01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:14.480\nThe point being, Sean McKenna is not someone that you want that from, you know, derision,\n\n01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.480\nyou don't take it lightly.\n\n01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:22.480\nLike I said, that, that pre pulled fiction comedy just was so easy back then.\n\n01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:28.480\nWhat, like he had a, he had an impression of Jimmy Durante that could, that was great.\n\n01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.480\nYeah, he involved a pair of glasses in his dick.\n\n01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.480\nYeah.\n\n01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.480\nHis closer was Jimmy Sneezy.\n\n01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.480\nYeah.\n\n01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.480\nSometimes Jimmy had a cold.\n\n01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.480\nLet's move on.\n\n01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:44.480\nSo anyway, the guy, the guy who would do that, I, I, as a joke, as a joke.\n\n01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:55.480\nAs a joke, I wiped my ass and, and Sean goes, Jesus Christ.\n\n01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:59.480\nDo you ever wipe your ass?\n\n01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:05.480\nAnd it was like, it didn't make sense to me until that moment.\n\n01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:14.480\nBut my, somebody hit rewind on the, on the VCR in my head and I rewound like from 24 to\n\n01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.480\n4 going, oh my God.\n\n01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:24.480\nI am the most disgusting person in the world and things started making sense.\n\n01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:29.480\nThe dots were connected and I was like, oh my God.\n\n01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.480\nI think it's probably, I don't have a girlfriend.\n\n01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.480\nBut after that, I was, I went for it.\n\n01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.480\nI was like washing, it was, it was scrubbing.\n\n01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.480\nIt just, just like, to OCD.\n\n01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.480\nAnd that escalated.\n\n01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.480\nLike we, because we found a, he could get special shower heads.\n\n01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.480\nWhen Kate, yes.\n\n01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:51.480\nKate, when we first moved in, Kate, because she was the best girlfriend in the world and\n\n01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:56.480\nnow is the most amazing wife in the world, please applaud.\n\n01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.480\nKate Freund.\n\n01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:05.480\nKate Freund married to the tank master.\n\n01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:11.480\nShe, she buys me as, I think it was like a birthday present or a Christmas present,\n\n01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.480\nlike a shower snake.\n\n01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.480\nYou know what it would, you know where you attach it so you could do it.\n\n01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.480\nJust so I could really wash my ass.\n\n01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.480\nBecause you wanted to, because she wanted you to.\n\n01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.480\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.480\nShe knew it would make you happy.\n\n01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:31.480\nAnd, and because I don't know, I got it in my head that the hotter the water, the cleaner\n\n01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.480\nit would be.\n\n01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.480\nMakes sense.\n\n01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.480\nAnd, and you know.\n\n01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480\nWorks for dishes.\n\n01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.480\nRight.\n\n01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.480\nYeah.\n\n01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.480\nThat's what I did.\n\n01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.480\nYeah.\n\n01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.480\nThat's what I was thinking.\n\n01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:49.480\nSo I, like, I remember, I remember there was a point where I was like, I have my leg up.\n\n01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.480\nI have a leg up.\n\n01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.480\nI know.\n\n01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.480\nYou dressed like a woman.\n\n01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.480\nI invited people.\n\n01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.480\nWhat?\n\n01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.480\nYou put on fishnets.\n\n01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.480\nYeah, I look good.\n\n01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:05.480\nI remember, I'm in the shower, my leg hiked up, spraying.\n\n01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:10.480\nAnd at the other, and the other hand is slowly turning up the heat.\n\n01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.480\nSo I'm going.\n\n01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.480\nAnd, and going.\n\n01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.480\nAh.\n\n01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.480\nAh.\n\n01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.480\nLike.\n\n01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.480\nTry again.\n\n01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.480\nOne pill makes you happy.\n\n01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.480\nYeah, just really trying.\n\n01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:36.480\nBecause I was trying to, to, to boil away 20 years worth of disgusting, terrible hygiene.\n\n01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:45.480\nAnd I remember we went, I remember like one, one time I went, I went really too far.\n\n01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:48.480\nAnd I think I got like an instant message.\n\n01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.480\nWell, that was like the night before New Year's.\n\n01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:59.480\nBecause we went to, we went to Vegas with, with Davis and, and, and like Akiva, Akiva\n\n01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:06.480\nShaffer was there and, and Drew Carey was there and, and I was like, well, it's, were\n\n01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.480\nyou, were you there?\n\n01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.480\nOkay.\n\n01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.480\nWere we dating it?\n\n01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.480\nOkay.\n\n01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.480\nAll right.\n\n01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.480\nWell, it's New Year's Eve.\n\n01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.480\nAll right.\n\n01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480\nTime to.\n\n01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.480\nOn the top patent tails here, let's just really clean it up.\n\n01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.480\nAnd I remember.\n\n01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.480\nDid we drive?\n\n01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.480\nWe drove there, right?\n\n01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:27.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:37.480\nSomewhere between the shower and the stroke of midnight, things just, just were not right\n\n01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.480\nwith the Taint Master.\n\n01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:49.240\nIt was, oh gee, and it was like, I, I scalded my entire, like, I just was like for a month,\n\n01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.600\nI was just like, good heavens.\n\n01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.080\nSo you went to this doctor.\n\n01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.080\nThat's the story that I.\n\n01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.080\nOkay.\n\n01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.080\nWait.\n\n01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.080\nThat's, I didn't know.\n\n01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.080\nThat's the prologue?\n\n01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.080\nYeah.\n\n01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.080\nThat's the prologue.\n\n01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:09.200\nThat's the, that's the crawl before we go to Tatooine.\n\n01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:16.680\nThis is a dark day for the rebellion or hot or hot.\n\n01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680\nIt could be hot.\n\n01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680\nIt could be
