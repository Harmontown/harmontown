WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
Hear ye, hear ye, Armenians.

00:01.720 --> 00:05.160
This is Dan Harmon talking to you from the studio,

00:05.160 --> 00:07.760
as opposed to live on stage,

00:07.760 --> 00:12.160
simply because we lost the first three minutes

00:12.160 --> 00:14.520
of our recording due to a little technical crash,

00:14.520 --> 00:15.360
it happens.

00:16.560 --> 00:20.840
You only miss the very beginning of the live recording,

00:20.840 --> 00:24.800
but so I'm just introducing it to make it make sense.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.760
While I've got your ear, I will caution you,

00:28.760 --> 00:32.040
this is an unexpectedly intimate episode of Harmontown.

00:33.240 --> 00:38.240
And I, you know, they're not usually family fair,

00:38.240 --> 00:42.400
but I will say, if you had any respect for me

00:42.400 --> 00:44.920
or my friend Rob Schrab,

00:44.920 --> 00:49.920
and it was based in any way on our manners,

00:51.160 --> 00:54.240
or our concern for our own posteriors,

00:54.240 --> 00:57.520
and lack of experimentation with them,

00:58.760 --> 01:01.040
you know, maybe don't listen to this episode.

01:01.040 --> 01:06.040
Maybe just watch community and the other shows

01:07.880 --> 01:09.600
and comic books and things that we make,

01:09.600 --> 01:11.800
and think of us as decent people,

01:11.800 --> 01:13.880
but you're gonna, if you do listen on,

01:13.880 --> 01:18.480
you're gonna hear a story from me about my butt hole,

01:19.920 --> 01:23.040
and a story from Rob about his.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.760
We didn't plan for that to be the theme of the evening,

01:24.760 --> 01:26.760
but it really turned out to be the case.

01:28.760 --> 01:29.600
That's about it.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.920
Oh, I also just wanna plug Harmontown Schrab's Found Crap,

01:33.920 --> 01:36.480
which is gonna be part of the Everything Is Terrible festival

01:36.480 --> 01:40.080
on August 26th, I think at 5.30 p.m.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.840
Come see, Rob Schrab puts together

01:42.840 --> 01:45.080
all these amazing found footage things.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.280
If you're in Los Angeles or near Los Angeles,

01:47.280 --> 01:49.840
it's definitely worth coming out for.

01:49.840 --> 01:53.200
Both he and I will be there and love to see you there.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.440
So we now join Harmontown in progress

01:55.440 --> 01:58.000
just to give you the context.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.640
Jeff started the show with some sexy music.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.360
We were talking about sexy music.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.480
It reminded me of the fact

02:03.480 --> 02:06.680
that I had given my girlfriend a little fashion show recently

02:06.680 --> 02:11.320
to Shade music, or I'm sorry, one more time.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.600
So we now join Harmontown in progress,

02:14.600 --> 02:16.120
just to give you the context.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.200
What you miss at the beginning

02:17.200 --> 02:19.520
is that Jeff started the show with some sexy music

02:19.520 --> 02:20.640
which reminded me of the fact

02:20.640 --> 02:22.320
that I had given my girlfriend

02:22.320 --> 02:26.520
a little fashion show a couple days earlier

02:26.520 --> 02:27.840
because she had bought me some new clothes.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.480
So here we go.

02:29.480 --> 02:34.280
And she said what music makes you feel sexy?

02:34.280 --> 02:37.560
And I immediately inexplicably blurted out, Shade.

02:37.560 --> 02:42.560
So it's just like, we're just playing a Shade album

02:43.160 --> 02:46.200
and I was trying on a bunch of checkered nerd shirts.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.640
Was it Smooth Operator?

02:48.640 --> 02:50.520
Yeah, well, that was Smooth Operator was in there.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.720
Sweetest Taboo, of course.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.680
I remember, it brought to mind a memory

02:55.680 --> 02:57.920
that I thought was so odd.

02:57.920 --> 03:02.200
When I was in junior high in Milwaukee in the 80s,

03:02.200 --> 03:03.200
they had this thing.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.160
They were called desegregation traps.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.120
They had come up with this thing

03:09.120 --> 03:12.000
where we had so many inner city schools

03:12.000 --> 03:14.640
that were so predominantly African-American.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.200
By the way, I hate that phrase.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.560
Isn't that a little demeaning African-American?

03:18.560 --> 03:19.960
They're not African.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.120
That makes it sound like they're foreigners.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.200
No one has a, well, no one is more American

03:24.200 --> 03:26.160
than a black person.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.760
Who has more right to not be hyphenated like that?

03:28.760 --> 03:30.280
That's terrible.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.560
Anyways, but it's up to them.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.440
I actually thought, I always thought,

03:38.440 --> 03:40.240
but it's, you know.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.240
What?

03:41.240 --> 03:44.320
We're gonna do race again.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.320
I thought we settled this in like three Harmontowns.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.920
I didn't even get a chance to talk about it last time.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.520
You dicks got all, all open to you about it.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.320
He wanted to hear about Mars rovers

03:55.320 --> 03:59.520
and, you know, Schrab was heckling and we might bring

03:59.520 --> 04:00.520
Schrab up later.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.520
I want him to tell his butthole doctor story,

04:02.520 --> 04:04.920
but I'm way off track already.

04:04.920 --> 04:08.120
This is not a, this is gonna be a low-key harmony.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.360
I'm very, very hungover.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.360
What was I just talking about?

04:12.360 --> 04:15.360
Okay, race, desegregation.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.120
It doesn't, nothing, I, it doesn't really,

04:18.120 --> 04:20.120
the story has nothing to do with race, really.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.120
I bet it does.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.120
I, in eighth grade, seventh and eighth grade,

04:24.120 --> 04:28.120
I went to Stuyben Middle School.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.120
Stuyben.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.120
And, you know, I was, you know,

04:31.120 --> 04:34.120
I went to Stuyben Middle School.

04:34.120 --> 04:37.120
I went to Stuyben Middle School.

04:37.120 --> 04:41.120
And it was, it was for the computer specialty,

04:41.120 --> 04:43.120
which was a desegregation trap.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.120
In reality, they had six Apple II E's in the basement.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.120
And they just wanted to, they were trying to bus

04:49.120 --> 04:55.120
white kids into schools that were so disproportionately black.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.120
And so I was like one of six white kids there

04:57.120 --> 05:00.120
to use their Apple II E's in the school.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.120
It was great.

05:01.120 --> 05:06.120
By the way, white people, much more racist than black people.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.120
That's, that's a, that's a genetic trait

05:09.120 --> 05:11.120
that I can actually, I believe in,

05:11.120 --> 05:14.120
because I went to, for much of my public school life,

05:14.120 --> 05:16.120
I went to predominantly black schools.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.120
And I never got picked on or,

05:18.120 --> 05:21.120
it was only when I went to the suburbs

05:21.120 --> 05:24.120
and started, you know, in these more predominantly white schools,

05:24.120 --> 05:26.120
I started getting picked on like a,

05:26.120 --> 05:28.120
remember a girl took a piece of tape

05:28.120 --> 05:31.120
and taped it secretly to a pair of jeans

05:31.120 --> 05:35.120
as a way of tracking how often I wore them in a week.

05:35.120 --> 05:39.120
Ooh.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.120
Like I was some kind of animal.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.120
I was like, this did, black people don't do this.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.120
That's, that's a stereotype.

05:46.120 --> 05:50.120
I am, I am comfortable saying black people are nicer than this.

05:50.120 --> 05:54.120
I'm not, I'm not a big fan of racial constructs,

05:54.120 --> 05:56.120
but I believe black people are nicer

05:56.120 --> 05:58.120
and less racist than white people there.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.120
Okay.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.120
I did get a little, so I was going,

06:01.120 --> 06:04.120
the story's not about race, everybody.

06:04.120 --> 06:07.120
Would you guys take it easy?

06:07.120 --> 06:10.120
This is, this story will not lean towards race.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.120
And we're, you know what I'm saying?

06:11.120 --> 06:12.120
We, we chased NT off.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.120
Where's NT?

06:13.120 --> 06:15.120
There are, he was, he was, he was always in the front row.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.120
Empty seat.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.120
Em, empty, empty seat.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.120
Uh, dumb.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.120
Edit it out.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.120
Just stupid.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.120
Leave it.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.120
Leave it.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.120
It stays.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.120
I, I'm not, I'm not witty tonight.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.120
I'm not, I can tell.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.120
I have a verbal thinker and I can,

06:33.120 --> 06:37.120
I can feel the muscle in my, in my verbal lobe.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.120
Uh, you know, I can tell you,

06:39.120 --> 06:41.120
there's days when it's on fire, you know,

06:41.120 --> 06:43.120
and it's kind of spinning and, and, and,

06:43.120 --> 06:45.120
and you know, I was like, I'm going to rock it.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.120
Uh, talking to people tonight.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.120
Can I, can I, have we told the story

06:48.120 --> 06:51.120
or can I ask you to tell the story about a roll call?

06:51.120 --> 06:53.120
Uh, and you know what I'm talking about?

06:53.120 --> 06:54.120
The guy?

06:54.120 --> 06:55.120
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.120
The guy who subverted roll call?

06:56.120 --> 06:57.120
Yeah, that, that, well, that all, yeah.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.120
That takes place at the same school.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.120
I just wanted to tell the story.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.120
I don't know, I don't, I don't think it's a good story.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.120
So buckle up.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.120
Uh, Shade reminded me of this.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.120
Shade.

07:06.120 --> 07:09.120
I was, I was in this computer specialty school

07:09.120 --> 07:11.120
and I was in my one computer class.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.120
I was taught by this guy named Mr. Blanchett.

07:13.120 --> 07:17.120
He caught a girl slipping, uh, uh, uh,

07:17.120 --> 07:20.120
another girl on note or something.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.120
And he, and so he did that awesome thing

07:22.120 --> 07:26.120
where you take the note and then he, he, he read it out loud.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.120
And it was just some, it was like,

07:28.120 --> 07:32.120
it was the girl was making fun of some other kid in the class

07:32.120 --> 07:37.120
by going, uh, oh, I know, I know, I know you love, uh, uh,

07:37.120 --> 07:38.120
Ronald.

07:38.120 --> 07:42.120
I know, you know, he, I know he gives you the sweetest taboo.

07:42.120 --> 07:46.120
And he, he's face turned purple.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.120
And he's like, you don't even know what that means.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.120
You know what, I ain't even talking about that.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.120
You're 13 years old.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.120
You don't even know what that means.

07:53.120 --> 07:56.120
I was like, no one knows what that means.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.120
You're not, you're not a real Shade fan.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.120
Yeah, exactly.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.120
The hardest core Shade fan.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.120
I've been to four of her concerts.

08:04.120 --> 08:08.120
I just really, I'm pretty sure it means fucking, uh, probably.

08:08.120 --> 08:12.120
And no one knows what that means more than a bunch of 13 year olds.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.120
Like, we're, we're, we're coming in our pants.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.120
Like, like, like, like, like, like by reading math books,

08:17.120 --> 08:19.120
like at that age, everybody gets,

08:19.120 --> 08:21.120
the school smelled like Gen Con.

08:21.120 --> 08:25.120
It was so, uh, it was, you know,

08:25.120 --> 08:29.120
there was so much testosterone and estrogen bursting out of us.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.120
Our faces were festooned with, with hormonal acne.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.120
And all of us were, you know,

08:34.120 --> 08:38.120
running into dark corners to touch ourselves every chance we got.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.120
I think, I think we know what the sweetest taboo is.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.120
I think it's bucket.

08:44.120 --> 08:49.120
Uh, in that same school, because you requested the story.

08:49.120 --> 08:54.120
This one is by request.

08:54.120 --> 08:57.120
Um, we were taking roll call.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.120
We're going to play sexy music over this.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.120
We were taking roll call as math class.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.120
The teacher said, it was the beginning of the school year.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.120
And the teacher said, I'll call your name.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.120
You say here if you're here.

09:08.120 --> 09:12.120
Also, if you have a name that you prefer to be called,

09:12.120 --> 09:14.120
you can let me know then.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.120
And what she meant is what happened to be like, you know,

09:16.120 --> 09:19.120
she'd say, uh, LaShonda Johnson.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.120
And then LaShonda would say, here, Shonda's fine.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.120
Okay, Shonda.

09:24.120 --> 09:29.120
Um, and, uh, uh, Deon Nash, uh, here.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.120
Uh, you can call me Dee.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.120
Dee, okay, great.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.120
Um, and then she calls this one guy's name.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.120
Uh, Trevor Smith.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.120
And this kid goes, uh,

09:40.120 --> 09:43.120
you may call me Royal Champagne.

09:43.120 --> 09:50.120
Just 12-year-old kid.

09:50.120 --> 09:54.120
And she went, no.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.120
Royal Champagne.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.120
It's so good.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.120
Uh, if I had been that teacher, I would have said, all right.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.120
And I would have called him up to the board every time.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.120
Yeah.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.120
Uh, what's the square root of 151?

10:05.120 --> 10:08.120
Royal Champagne, would you treat us?

10:08.120 --> 10:10.120
Well, there was such a, she was probably scared.

10:10.120 --> 10:13.120
It was like, uh, you know, you never knew back then it was like,

10:13.120 --> 10:15.120
they had to have rules against magic markers.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.120
It was such an odd thing.

10:17.120 --> 10:22.120
I don't know if this, if this was a place in time or if this is true for

10:22.120 --> 10:27.120
12 and 13-year-olds in middle school, but everyone was obsessed with gangs.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.120
None of us were in any, uh, like, but everyone was like,

10:30.120 --> 10:34.120
they were always drawing little pitchfork symbols and, and, and stars.

10:34.120 --> 10:38.120
They were gang symbols for the local Milwaukee gangs on the walls.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.120
This is, this is junior high school?

10:40.120 --> 10:41.120
Or, uh, this is junior high.

10:41.120 --> 10:44.120
Yeah, we're, I mean, we're not, you know, but nobody in that school was

10:44.120 --> 10:49.120
rolling with the two seven boys, uh, which was one of the local gangs

10:49.120 --> 10:52.120
from 27th Street and then there were the black gangster disciples,

10:52.120 --> 10:55.120
BGD, and their symbol was like a little pitchfork.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.120
Um, I'm holding up my hand to form a little pitchfork.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.120
Those pitchforks aren't straight, man.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.120
Oh God.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.120
That reminds me of the story.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.120
I'm like, yeah, there was a, we were in metal shop and, uh,

11:03.120 --> 11:06.120
then the teacher put on a slide projector and then just like 85,

11:06.120 --> 11:11.120
like pitchfork shadows come into, into the thing, including me probably.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.120
It just became a thing. It was like that and beatboxing, we were all just doing it.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.120
It was, it was the culture.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.120
It was like, you did, people were walking down the hall just going,

11:17.120 --> 11:22.120
um, you just did it all the time.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.120
Wait, wait, wait, that was pretty good.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.120
Yeah.

11:25.120 --> 11:32.120
I, I, I went to shooibin.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.120
No, no, no, no one actually did that.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.120
That was a, don't, don't extend yourself.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.120
Yeah.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.120
Well, no, that's, that's the hacky thing.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.120
My, my mom, I used to come home and do that.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.120
My mom's impressed.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.120
I should go, well, you stop doing that with the,

11:45.120 --> 11:48.120
I'm stop, I'm stop, I'm stop, I'm stop.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.120
I'm stop, I'm stop.

11:49.120 --> 11:53.120
There's not a white guy in this room that hasn't tried his hand at beatbox at some point.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.120
We've all tried it.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.120
Yeah.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.120
I'm, I'm darn good at it in a pinch.

11:58.120 --> 12:02.120
Uh, the, uh, so, so, uh, let's see, there was budge.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.120
Oh yeah.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.120
So, so, so all these pitchfork shadows come into the slide projectors,

12:06.120 --> 12:10.120
uh, uh, illumination and, uh, and then you just hear this guy,

12:10.120 --> 12:13.120
John Morse, uh, who was this big tall, he was like,

12:13.120 --> 12:15.120
seemed like it was nine feet tall.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.120
You know, it was one of those beanpole, like, like, like,

12:18.120 --> 12:21.120
like, sprouters and, uh, and he was kind of like,

12:21.120 --> 12:23.120
I think it was a little touched.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.120
I think he was one of those kids who slips through the cracks.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.120
Like he's, he wasn't special enough to take advantage of being special.

12:29.120 --> 12:33.120
He was, he was just, you know, you just, you just felt like he was,

12:33.120 --> 12:37.120
he was destined for, for bad times or Verizon employment, you know,

12:37.120 --> 12:41.120
like, he's, he's just going to end up and, and, and, and he,

12:41.120 --> 12:44.120
he would, he would just sit in the class and beat box and do his

12:44.120 --> 12:47.120
pitchforks and then like, uh, he, yeah, all those shadows came in

12:47.120 --> 12:50.120
and then you, he is like, the shop teacher is like,

12:50.120 --> 12:51.120
okay, we're going to watch a film strip.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.120
And he says, all right, all right, all right.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.120
He's so sick of seeing pitchfork shadows.

12:55.120 --> 12:58.120
And then you just hear John Morse is the last one in there.

12:58.120 --> 13:02.120
You see his other hand come in and physically straighten his own

13:02.120 --> 13:05.120
fingers like he's perfecting his pitchfork.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.120
And then you just hear John Morse in the, in the dark,

13:07.120 --> 13:11.120
uh, metal shop room go, damn, my pitchforks is straight,

13:11.120 --> 13:13.120
which was not a thing.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.120
It was not a, he was, no one cared how straight your pitchforks were.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.120
That was, that's a, that's a, that's a 13 year old brain,

13:20.120 --> 13:24.120
you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, it's, it's sad really.

13:24.120 --> 13:28.120
It's like this gang culture and all kids are pure of heart

13:28.120 --> 13:30.120
and just want to have fun and do things better than, you know,

13:30.120 --> 13:33.120
we just want to play video games and fuck around.

13:33.120 --> 13:37.120
Uh, pitchforks, um, uh, my car might get blown up

13:37.120 --> 13:39.120
by the blank gangster disciples tonight.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.120
I don't know.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.120
I don't know if they're comfortable with me talking about them.

13:42.120 --> 13:46.120
Uh, one of their sayings was false flag is a fag.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.120
Ooh.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.120
Yeah.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.120
You weren't, you weren't supposed to throw up pitchforks

13:50.120 --> 13:52.120
if you weren't actually in BGD.

13:52.120 --> 13:56.120
I went to, I went to public school in Los Angeles

13:56.120 --> 13:58.120
during the late 80s, early 90s.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.120
And that's when everybody was in a gang, like for real.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.120
And you went to a party.

14:02.120 --> 14:06.120
You could go to a party in like a, a, a lower class neighborhood,

14:06.120 --> 14:09.120
a, a working class, middle class, upper class neighborhood,

14:09.120 --> 14:12.120
and gangs would come, like the, like Compton Crips,

14:12.120 --> 14:16.120
like Bloods would come, like a big bad gun totem,

14:16.120 --> 14:18.120
bad motherfuckers would show up.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.120
And we were all just like nerds.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.120
And like, like, like, I used to wear like,

14:22.120 --> 14:25.120
cause I was like a body border and I had dreadlocks.

14:25.120 --> 14:28.120
Hey man.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.120
It was 1987.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.120
You guys weren't there.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.120
I had like natural dreadlocks.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.120
I also, I also had a tan picture of that.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.120
I mean, even us in Milwaukee were into the ocean Pacific culture.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.120
And you really lived on ocean Pacific.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.120
I would like, I would like,

14:41.120 --> 14:42.120
I would like wear like a little like bandana,

14:42.120 --> 14:43.120
but I was smart enough that you,

14:43.120 --> 14:45.120
you couldn't wear like eight colors.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.120
There were eight colors that if you wore,

14:47.120 --> 14:48.120
someone would come up to you and grab it.

14:48.120 --> 14:52.120
And I was like a, an arcade bowling alley kind of thing.

14:52.120 --> 14:55.120
And I walked outside and I had like a green,

14:55.120 --> 14:58.120
like bandana on like, you know,

14:58.120 --> 14:59.120
kind of tied in the back.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.120
Like, I don't know what I was doing.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.120
And I got jumped by 12 guys and they just came up

15:03.120 --> 15:06.120
and just like kicked me in the chest, knocked me down.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.120
I'm all alone.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.120
I was, you know, I'm six foot four now,

15:09.120 --> 15:12.120
but I was, I was, I was five foot four as a freshman

15:12.120 --> 15:13.120
in high school.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.120
I grew 10 and a half inches.

15:14.120 --> 15:17.120
So I was very little and very skinny.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.120
And these six Latino guys jumped me

15:19.120 --> 15:21.120
and the main alpha dude walks up

15:21.120 --> 15:23.120
and he grabs my bandana off and he goes,

15:23.120 --> 15:26.120
yo bro, you want your rag back?

15:26.120 --> 15:29.120
You got to claim it back from Cactus Bunch.

15:29.120 --> 15:33.120
What in the fuck?

15:33.120 --> 15:37.120
What in the strawberry shortcake?

15:37.120 --> 15:39.120
Unicorn mythology.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.120
Cactus?

15:40.120 --> 15:41.120
What?

15:41.120 --> 15:42.120
Cactus pickles?

15:42.120 --> 15:43.120
What were they called?

15:43.120 --> 15:45.120
It was the first I'd heard of them.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.120
What did you say?

15:47.120 --> 15:49.120
Cactus Bunch.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.120
Bunch?

15:50.120 --> 15:51.120
Cactus Bunch.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.120
A bunch.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.120
That's like a Don Knotts Tim Conway movie.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.120
A bunch?

15:56.120 --> 15:59.120
They weren't, I'm not saying it was the toughest gang in town.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.120
I'm saying, I'm saying there was 14 of them

16:01.120 --> 16:04.120
and they had my, they had my rag.

16:04.120 --> 16:07.120
So the guy took the fucking bandana off

16:07.120 --> 16:08.120
and he goes, you want his back?

16:08.120 --> 16:10.120
You got to claim it from Cactus Bunch.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.120
Bunch.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.120
Yeah.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.120
Well, well.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.120
Cactus, Cactus Bunch, Cactus Bunch was even more dangerous.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.120
That's how their wives were.

16:18.120 --> 16:22.120
Yeah, they met at the Bellaire Hotel every Sunday.

16:22.120 --> 16:26.120
Little cucumber sandwiches and they would just talk shit.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.120
They said, claim it from Cactus Bunch.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.120
And I was like, hey man, I found that.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.120
It's yours to keep.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.120
It gets too cold in Milwaukee for people to be that violent.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.120
We all have to hibernate.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.120
We have to save our energy.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.120
Yeah.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.120
Oh, by the way, my apologies to the black gangster disciples,

16:46.120 --> 16:48.120
the two seven boys and the Cactus Bunch,

16:48.120 --> 16:50.120
and the Cactus Bunch, especially the Cactus Bunch,

16:50.120 --> 16:52.120
because, because we really took them.

16:52.120 --> 16:56.120
I want the Cactus Bunch members that are listening to the podcast

16:56.120 --> 17:00.120
to know my issue is not with your manhood.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.120
It's simply with your nomenclature.

17:03.120 --> 17:10.120
It's your ability to name your gang properly that I question.

17:10.120 --> 17:12.120
I don't question your ability to murder me.

17:12.120 --> 17:15.120
Cactus Bunch, it's so adorable.

17:15.120 --> 17:19.120
We're the hug a bunch.

17:19.120 --> 17:23.120
There's a really old school gang in Los Angeles called Las Cantaranas,

17:23.120 --> 17:25.120
which is the singing frogs.

17:25.120 --> 17:29.120
But they're a very, very old, like, you know, veterano gang.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.120
All right.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.120
Well, my hat's off to them.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.120
Rags at half-mast.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.120
Pitchforks straight.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.120
Let's get off this topic.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.120
I feel like I'm going to get in trouble.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.120
But speaking of bummers, tonight is going to be a bummer.

17:44.120 --> 17:47.120
That's why I got fashion and style advice questions from you guys.

17:47.120 --> 17:51.120
It's because I wanted to commit to tonight being a bummer.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.120
I'm very hungover.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.120
I went to a bachelor party last night.

17:54.120 --> 17:59.120
Like I told you, I woke up this morning and I knew I'm not going to be funny tonight.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.120
I'm not going to be insightful.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.120
I'm not going to be witty.

18:02.120 --> 18:05.120
I'm only going to waste your time and steal your $10.

18:05.120 --> 18:09.120
So I wanted to just be above board about that.

18:09.120 --> 18:16.120
And so for the questions that we got from the audience tonight, they're on a topic that I am bound to fail at speaking to,

18:16.120 --> 18:18.120
which is style and fashion.

18:18.120 --> 18:25.120
I picked the worst topic that I could think of to commit to tonight being the worst Harmontown ever.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.120
So buckle up.

18:26.120 --> 18:31.120
And if you're listening at home, stop.

18:31.120 --> 18:38.120
Dan, someone from our audience asks, why do all girls think they can wear leggings?

18:38.120 --> 18:40.120
What does that mean?

18:40.120 --> 18:42.120
Because they can.

18:42.120 --> 18:46.120
Young man?

18:46.120 --> 18:50.120
Well, aren't they kind of a one-size-fits-all?

18:50.120 --> 18:54.120
Are leggings just like tights without feet?

18:54.120 --> 18:59.120
I think that someone's saying that some people wear them to greater acclaim and success than other people.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.120
Well, that's everything.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.120
That's all clothes.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.120
I'm already pissed off at this category.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.120
What the hell are you talking about?

19:05.120 --> 19:07.120
You chose the topic.

19:07.120 --> 19:13.120
That's not the tyranny of hot people.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.120
If you look good, you can wear a towel.

19:16.120 --> 19:25.120
Why do you have to also, in addition to that, ugly people are the ones who should be caring the most about clothes.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.120
You shouldn't go, oh, her ass is too fat.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.120
She shouldn't be wearing those pants.

19:29.120 --> 19:36.120
Fuck you, you bad person.

19:36.120 --> 19:39.120
I told you, I wasn't kidding, man.

19:39.120 --> 19:42.120
I'm not on all four cylinders tonight.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.120
I'm on two.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.120
Why?

19:46.120 --> 19:47.120
Because they can.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.120
They can wear leggings.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.120
Shame on you.

19:50.120 --> 19:54.120
You snarky David Spade type.

19:54.120 --> 19:58.120
All right, Dan.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.120
Let's see you in a pair of leggings.

20:00.120 --> 20:04.120
Ms. Thang or Mr.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.120
And this question, if you were a lady.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.120
I will say this.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.120
Sorry.

20:08.120 --> 20:12.120
Here's a good question that should be asked.

20:12.120 --> 20:22.120
Why do some women, how do you find out as a woman, when do you learn who tells you what newsletter do you get that tells you that you can't just wear tights as pants?

20:22.120 --> 20:27.120
You ever go to the mall and you just see some lady who didn't get the telegram.

20:27.120 --> 20:31.120
She's just wearing, it's so jarring visually.

20:31.120 --> 20:34.120
So it's like, you're just not wearing any pants.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.120
Those are underwear.

20:36.120 --> 20:38.120
And you're just wearing them like you do.

20:38.120 --> 20:46.120
Is it just like a thing that you see someone else doing it and then you do it and that's like someone has to, you know, tights aren't pants for sure.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.120
I know that.

20:48.120 --> 20:51.120
That's not like a no white after labor day thing.

20:51.120 --> 20:56.120
That's like a you can't just wear underwear for pants.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.120
Those are tights.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.120
But you love tights.

20:59.120 --> 21:07.120
Yeah, I do, but I like them because I mean their tights aren't really just just wearing a pair of tights walking around the mall isn't that's not flattering on anybody.

21:07.120 --> 21:11.120
You could be, I'm going to date myself, Cindy Crawford.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.120
I don't know who's who's hot now.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.120
Who's who's the Kate Moss?

21:15.120 --> 21:17.120
You could be Kate Moss.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.120
Let's get lost tonight.

21:22.120 --> 21:29.120
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight.

21:29.120 --> 21:34.120
Dan, if you were a lady, somebody asked and I am.

21:34.120 --> 21:37.120
What kind of dress would you wear?

21:37.120 --> 21:39.120
Oh, that's a good question.

21:39.120 --> 21:50.120
If I were a, if I were a lady, I would, I would, I would, I think I would dress a lot like the, the beautiful red headed poet girl from head of the class.

21:50.120 --> 21:56.120
I think I would have a kind of like Laura Ingalls wilder kind of Bohemian Edie Brackel kind of.

21:56.120 --> 22:08.120
I think I'd wear a lot of very long skirts with with with with now you're dating yourself with with tights and like like a cardigan sweater.

22:08.120 --> 22:15.120
You're like, you're like a like a horny Iceman or your, your, your, your boner is frozen in like 1987.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.120
Oh man, it really is.

22:17.120 --> 22:28.120
I, I, I, I, you know, for pornography, while other people are going to the you porn and the, and the porn hub dot coms, I will often, I believe me, I will go there too.

22:28.120 --> 22:33.120
But I will often go to YouTube and just type in like aerobics.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.120
And it's enough for me.

22:38.120 --> 22:43.120
Cynthia Caroluck was a Canadian fitness lady.

22:43.120 --> 22:47.120
She was just, she was just 80s.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.120
She was intact this bunch, wasn't she?

22:49.120 --> 22:57.120
She went to, she would always, you know, she would, she would pronounce a boot wrong and tell you how to exercise.

22:57.120 --> 23:06.120
And she would, you know, she'd wear like these like leotards and cross trainers and white socks and tights, pantyhose, whatever, whatever.

23:06.120 --> 23:12.120
What is your obsession with like, because like, I like stockings, but like for some reason tights less so.

23:12.120 --> 23:17.120
I can't qualify why that is, but you love tights and like leggings.

23:17.120 --> 23:20.120
I just like, I like women.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.120
I like that they're soft and fun to touch.

23:22.120 --> 23:30.120
I want them to be, I just, I like, I like the, you know, it's weird.

23:30.120 --> 23:39.120
Fetishes are weird because there's a, there's a logic to them to a certain degree, but then there's just some weird, I think something happened to me when I was six years old or something.

23:39.120 --> 23:48.120
A lot of people who have like feet fetishes or, or like nylon fetishes, they'll, they'll have memories of like playing under the table with their matchbox cars.

23:48.120 --> 23:51.120
Well, and their, and their aunt was crossing and uncrossing their legs.

23:51.120 --> 23:54.120
Like they'll have a visceral memory of some sexual awakening for them.

23:54.120 --> 23:58.120
And I think what it is, is that I think your brain just pops like popcorn.

23:58.120 --> 24:05.120
I think, I think there's a certain point as a primate that you're just walking down the street and, and you're going to turn into a sexual entity.

24:05.120 --> 24:12.120
And, and, and unfortunately, whatever you're looking at, whatever, whatever's around you, you're going to, okay, he's a chocolate file.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.120
Wait, it's a Hersha file.

24:14.120 --> 24:22.120
I don't remember what era it would have been, but I'm pretty sure I drove one of my, like either my old crappy Volkswagen or my shitty Honda.

24:22.120 --> 24:28.120
And I drove you to Sunset and La Brea to, was it a Wendy's or an El Pollo?

24:28.120 --> 24:30.120
Oh man, this is a little embarrassing.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.120
Yeah.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.120
Okay, go ahead.

24:33.120 --> 24:38.120
Yes, you drove me to buy, this is before the internet was really a thing.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.120
I'll say.

24:39.120 --> 24:43.120
You drove me to buy, I was, I had arranged.

24:43.120 --> 24:47.120
It was like going to a drug deal.

24:47.120 --> 24:56.120
I had arranged to buy VHS tapes from a guy who was in town who I, on the internet, the internet existed, but it wasn't like a place where you could watch video yet.

24:56.120 --> 25:01.120
That, that didn't happen until Rob Schrab and I invented it with Channel 101.

25:01.120 --> 25:05.120
Do you want to explain what VHS tapes are?

25:05.120 --> 25:08.120
They are these giant cassettes.

25:08.120 --> 25:11.120
Shut up.

25:11.120 --> 25:23.120
You drove me to a clandestine meeting with a guy who made videos of women just basically wearing tights and pantyhose and hanging out.

25:23.120 --> 25:34.120
Like you wouldn't, it doesn't even count as pornography, like there's a certain breed of video I watch where it's like, it'll just be a woman at a desk just going like, hello sir.

25:34.120 --> 25:38.120
You want me to hold your calls and then she just kind of crosses her legs.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.120
It's called James Bond.

25:40.120 --> 25:43.120
And then they start just robbing and I just, next day.

25:43.120 --> 25:49.120
But a guy like, you got out of my car and we're at the Wendy's or El Pollo Loco or whatever it was, Sunset and La Brea.

25:49.120 --> 25:53.120
And I'm waiting in the car like, shit, something's about to go bad, man.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.120
I got a bad feeling about this.

25:54.120 --> 25:59.120
And a guy came out with a ratty old cardboard box full of VHS tapes.

25:59.120 --> 26:02.120
Well, because I'm not going to buy one, so I bought all of them.

26:02.120 --> 26:06.120
And it wouldn't make sense to buy one.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.120
Like, okay, how many do you have?

26:08.120 --> 26:11.120
And at the time I was just kind of rolling and like heat vision and Jack money.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.120
Like, I didn't know what to do.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.120
I was living in a one bedroom apartment in Hollywood.

26:15.120 --> 26:22.120
Just 550 a month and I had like $300,000, like, you know, just sitting in a pile.

26:22.120 --> 26:24.120
And I was like, what do I do?

26:24.120 --> 26:25.120
What do we do?

26:25.120 --> 26:26.120
A Wilcox apartment?

26:26.120 --> 26:27.120
Yeah.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.120
Yeah.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.120
Yeah.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.120
Wilcox.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.120
That apartment was amazing.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.120
Cause there was a little like, like a eight unit like apartment building.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.120
Like this is a regular old like Hollywood apartment building.

26:36.120 --> 26:39.120
And you walked in and Dan had bought the world's biggest desk.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.120
Like the desk was most of the room, right?

26:41.120 --> 26:42.120
Yeah.

26:42.120 --> 26:44.120
It was almost as big as my living room.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.520
Dan, at that point in his life, had decided he was going to be like Einstein and wear

26:47.520 --> 26:50.640
the same outfit every day, so yeah.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.640
Seth Brundle.

26:51.640 --> 26:57.040
So yeah, he'd gone to Sears and bought like what, like a dozen of the same blue shirts.

26:57.040 --> 27:04.800
I got like these baby blue short sleeve button shirts and like six black ties.

27:04.800 --> 27:08.560
So if you wanted to visit Dan, it looked like he wanted to go visit the manager of the local

27:08.560 --> 27:09.560
Albertsons.

27:09.560 --> 27:17.000
Except, I dressed like Gus from Breaking Bad, but there was porn, mountain dew and pizza

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
boxes everywhere.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Yeah, there was a lot of porn and a little mannequin part sometimes.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.640
So I never got to see that hidden away in his bedroom, there was the only part of Dan's

27:25.640 --> 27:29.480
life that had any shame that he wouldn't allow everybody to see.

27:29.480 --> 27:34.200
Like I went toward the bedroom, you kind of demurred one time when I went toward the bedroom

27:34.200 --> 27:36.560
and like, no, no, no, no, that's the menagerie.

27:36.560 --> 27:40.680
Well, that's what Rob called it, the menagerie.

27:40.680 --> 27:41.680
What was the menagerie?

27:41.680 --> 27:47.840
Well, it was, look, I was trying to figure out who I was and what I was into.

27:47.840 --> 27:52.360
I knew it had something to do with legs and nylon and...

27:52.360 --> 27:53.360
And cadavers.

27:53.360 --> 28:01.040
Well, you certainly would have a strong case for profiling me as a serial killer back then.

28:01.040 --> 28:07.760
I've since moved on and I date human women now and everything's fine, but yeah, I was

28:07.760 --> 28:12.120
like, well, here, what my thing was, I was a serial monogamous, I kept getting in these

28:12.120 --> 28:17.280
relationships, I kept wasting women's time and then it always ended in heartbreak and

28:17.280 --> 28:22.640
I was like, you know, I sure like jerking off and if I can just figure out how to do

28:22.640 --> 28:29.360
it perfectly, if I can just be the Chuck Jagger of masturbation, if I can figure out what

28:29.360 --> 28:33.760
it is that really flips my switches and then just be happy.

28:33.760 --> 28:37.800
That was the whole point behind getting the shirts and that was also, there was a reading

28:37.800 --> 28:40.840
Campbell's Hero of the Thousand Faces for the first time and I was becoming obsessive

28:40.840 --> 28:46.040
as drawing circles everywhere and like trying to figure out this, like simplify the story

28:46.040 --> 28:47.040
model.

28:47.040 --> 28:56.800
I was self-actualized, I admired that mannequin fucking a Gus Fring serial killer.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.200
What comprised the menagerie?

28:59.200 --> 29:05.000
It was just, okay, at one point I bought a mannequin to see what that would be like.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
A full body mannequin.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Yeah, because I thought-

29:07.000 --> 29:08.520
Where do you go to buy a mannequin?

29:08.520 --> 29:12.680
You were like online, it was like I ordered it from like a mannequin warehouse.

29:12.680 --> 29:17.040
Did you pretend to be like a fashion designer or something?

29:17.040 --> 29:21.600
I don't know, well, I fell back on the idea that what I was doing was so weird that no

29:21.600 --> 29:25.360
one would ever suspect, no one would ever go, hey, are you gonna fuck this?

29:25.360 --> 29:27.480
Who would think that?

29:27.480 --> 29:28.480
I'm weird.

29:28.480 --> 29:32.440
I bet that amounts to like 50% of their mannequin sales.

29:32.440 --> 29:36.520
I read stuff about, there's a whole branch of the fetish that's like, you know, there

29:36.520 --> 29:41.760
was a story in the paper, there's no such thing as paper anymore, but there was a story

29:41.760 --> 29:46.080
online, I remember reading about a guy who got arrested because for the third time or

29:46.080 --> 29:49.880
something he smashed a display window of a certain story.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.680
He was in love with a mannequin.

29:52.680 --> 29:58.440
There was one specific one that he kept abducting and he couldn't, he would rather break the

29:58.440 --> 30:00.400
law than go home without her.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.320
Wait, did the mannequin keep escaping and go back to work?

30:03.320 --> 30:05.800
Why did he have to do it three times?

30:05.800 --> 30:10.400
Well, as soon as there was no one around, she would turn into Kim Cottrell and, no,

30:10.400 --> 30:13.960
it was, I don't know, I think they would catch him because he was better at loving mannequins

30:13.960 --> 30:14.960
than he was a criminal.

30:14.960 --> 30:18.760
I mean, I don't think he was, if he was a good criminal, if his passion was for crime,

30:18.760 --> 30:20.160
he would have robbed a bank.

30:20.160 --> 30:24.800
He was just so horny for this mannequin that he was breaking glass and he was getting caught

30:24.800 --> 30:27.720
because it's probably hard to abscond with those things.

30:27.720 --> 30:31.000
Isn't there a mannequin in Silver Lake or Los Feliz that you have a thing for?

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Say what?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.560
Isn't there a mannequin that you have a little crush on?

30:33.560 --> 30:38.720
Well, no, that's, that's McGathey's jealous of this, this, this mannequin on Hillhurst

30:38.720 --> 30:44.160
that is a, there's a record store and there's a mannequin in the window that's like sitting

30:44.160 --> 30:48.360
in like a, like a reclining chair and she's listening to headphones and she has a red

30:48.360 --> 30:49.360
wig on.

30:49.360 --> 30:55.400
So pretty, pretty sweet, but I, I, her bit is when we walk past it, she gets jealous

30:55.400 --> 30:56.400
of the mannequin.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.400
That's her, that's her bit.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.080
And I'm over mannequins now, man.

30:59.080 --> 31:02.120
I, I, I love the, I love the real thing.

31:02.120 --> 31:05.680
I wasn't, I wasn't really into mannequins per se.

31:05.680 --> 31:11.720
I was, I was trying to become the most self-reliant man in the world.

31:11.720 --> 31:16.560
I was trying to, as long as we're here, as long as we're down at the bottom of this fucking

31:16.560 --> 31:20.200
circle, I'll, I'll say it, I bought a real doll.

31:20.200 --> 31:25.640
One of those things online, like it's like a $5,000, like, I think somebody just gasped

31:25.640 --> 31:28.920
and it's, it's pretty extreme shit.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.840
It costs a lot of money and then they send you a giant crate and there's a fake woman

31:32.840 --> 31:36.800
in a box and then it's a sex doll.

31:36.800 --> 31:37.800
I bought one.

31:37.800 --> 31:42.440
Rob Schrober and I didn't see you for three months and I was, when you did, you had a

31:42.440 --> 31:44.360
big smile on your face.

31:44.360 --> 31:50.040
I was the best relationship that I had to date at that, at that time.

31:50.040 --> 31:53.360
I, I think it was an important thing because it was like, you talked to, sometimes you

31:53.360 --> 31:55.720
talked to people and they're like, oh, I can't, I can't be in a relationship.

31:55.720 --> 31:56.720
I don't know.

31:56.720 --> 31:59.320
It's, it has something to do with loss of control and that all this stuff.

31:59.320 --> 32:03.720
It's like, you know, figure out who you are and what you want, like, get to the bottom

32:03.720 --> 32:04.720
of your circle.

32:04.720 --> 32:09.320
I think there would be less sexual crime and victimization and objectification of women

32:09.320 --> 32:14.840
if, if men would be a little more like indulgent with themselves of like what they really were

32:14.840 --> 32:18.160
thinking and wanting and, and, and so that they didn't have all this shame that had to

32:18.160 --> 32:22.600
get redirected and come out at weird times with the people that had the misfortune of

32:22.600 --> 32:23.880
running across their path.

32:23.880 --> 32:28.760
I, I, I looked at it like, like I was just trying to, I was, I was looking for the perfect

32:28.760 --> 32:32.440
back scratcher to scratch this itch because I was so, I was becoming so ashamed of myself

32:32.440 --> 32:33.600
for dating women.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.400
It's like, you know that this relationship isn't going to work.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.800
Stop doing this.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.400
Stop putting yourself out there.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.920
When you know that something is going to end with someone else being hurt and you do it

32:42.920 --> 32:45.000
anyway, then you're a bad person.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Figure your shit out.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.280
What do you like?

32:48.280 --> 32:56.000
And the answer is anguora sweaters and nylon.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.120
So is that what you would wear?

32:59.120 --> 33:00.120
Is that what?

33:00.120 --> 33:01.600
If you were a lady, is that what you would wear?

33:01.600 --> 33:04.440
Yeah, I would do that too, but only at home.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.440
I wouldn't like go out in it.

33:05.440 --> 33:08.360
I would like roll around in the bed in it.

33:08.360 --> 33:11.920
If I was a woman, I would just, yeah, I would just, I would just buy a bunch of outfits and

33:11.920 --> 33:14.120
roll around in the bed and look at myself in a mirror.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.480
But I think that's all guys would think that because they'd be like, oh, I'm a woman.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.480
I'm a human playboy.

33:19.480 --> 33:24.960
I was dating a girl one time and I told her I liked stockings so she wore a fishnet stockings.

33:24.960 --> 33:31.600
And during the course of our interplay or intercourse, they, you know, they were torn

33:31.600 --> 33:32.600
a little bit.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.720
So the next morning she left my apartment and then she threw them out in the trash can

33:35.720 --> 33:37.040
by my bed.

33:37.040 --> 33:40.400
So she left and went to work and I'm there and there's these stockings in there.

33:40.400 --> 33:46.000
And I had never put stockings on before and I thought, well, I thought, I'm into stockings.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.880
Let's, let's, if I'm going to jump in the pool, let's touch the bottom.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.880
Let's find out.

33:49.880 --> 33:56.120
I'm not going to, I'm not going to not put them on and wonder if maybe that's where

33:56.120 --> 33:57.120
I'm going with this.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.120
That's what I'm saying.

33:58.120 --> 34:02.920
Well, if I'm Tim Curry from, you know, from Rocky Horror, well, why are you expressing

34:02.920 --> 34:03.920
all this?

34:03.920 --> 34:04.920
I'm not.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.640
Just Mayan wonderment at my, that's what I was doing.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.680
I was trying to figure out like, where does this lead?

34:08.680 --> 34:09.680
Where does this end?

34:09.680 --> 34:10.680
Where does this go?

34:10.680 --> 34:15.160
So I put them on and, you know, it felt pretty good, you know, you put them on and feel kind

34:15.160 --> 34:16.160
of sexy.

34:16.160 --> 34:17.320
Like that's part of what stockings are about.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.320
I don't know why I like them so much, but I put them on, but you know, like I've got

34:20.320 --> 34:22.360
knobby knees and I've got hairy legs.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.360
It didn't look good.

34:23.360 --> 34:27.200
I didn't, I didn't have sexy legs, but they felt kind of good putting on and like, I was

34:27.200 --> 34:28.200
like, oh, that's cool.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.280
I like that.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.080
I like them better on women's legs and my own.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.080
So I took them off.

34:33.080 --> 34:36.360
I, you know, I kind of, you know, I, I, I posed and primped and preened a little bit in front

34:36.360 --> 34:37.360
of the mirror.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.600
I gave, I gave, I gave with a full college try and then I took them off and I threw them

34:40.600 --> 34:45.080
out and I told my girlfriend, I said, you know, I, I pulled your stockings out of

34:45.080 --> 34:46.080
the garbage.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.080
And I tried them on.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.080
I was like, God damn it.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.080
I knew it.

34:49.080 --> 34:50.080
I knew it.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.080
I was going to take it with me.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.080
I knew you'd put them on.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.080
I was like, I didn't.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.080
All right.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.080
Yeah.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.080
I didn't like it.

34:56.080 --> 34:57.680
Uh, you know what?

34:57.680 --> 35:03.160
I did once that I've never told anybody except for, I never told anybody that's except for

35:03.160 --> 35:06.520
the community writer's room because we had a, you know, I encouraged to kind of like

35:06.520 --> 35:10.760
write what you know, explore yourselves, like, like confess things and let's write episodes

35:10.760 --> 35:15.760
about these things.

35:15.760 --> 35:18.760
Uh, I, uh, okay.

35:18.760 --> 35:21.760
The story, you could cut the tension with a knife in here right now.

35:21.760 --> 35:26.320
Well, yeah, because there's absolutely no, isn't that a refreshing thing though to not

35:26.320 --> 35:30.760
know for sure that what I'm about to say isn't going to make your eyes fall out of your head.

35:30.760 --> 35:36.160
I like, you really don't know what I'm about to say because I have established that I might

35:36.160 --> 35:37.160
say anything.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.160
I used to fuck a plastic lady, but here's something I never told anybody.

35:40.160 --> 35:41.160
Yeah.

35:41.160 --> 35:57.860
Uh, the story ends with a sharpie pen up my ass.

35:57.860 --> 36:00.160
It begins innocently enough.

36:00.160 --> 36:06.680
Take us to the hero's journey of this.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.800
Can you make this Kenbellion part of that?

36:08.800 --> 36:10.840
It begins in Milwaukee with Schrab.

36:10.840 --> 36:15.880
Schrab was my first, Schrab's the longest friend that I currently have that I, he's, the friend

36:15.880 --> 36:18.680
that, all of the friends that I have now, Schrab is the guy I've known the longest.

36:18.680 --> 36:19.680
We met in Milwaukee.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.960
I was 17 when I met Schrab.

36:21.960 --> 36:28.680
Uh, Schrab, Schrab told me like once, you know, we started bonding about it.

36:28.680 --> 36:32.680
I was like, well, man, I really like jerking off.

36:32.680 --> 36:34.160
Yeah, me too.

36:34.160 --> 36:39.200
You know, we were, we were, we were friends, we, we communicated with each other.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.520
We were, uh, talking about, we would, we would shower together.

36:41.520 --> 36:42.520
It was, no, I'm kidding.

36:42.520 --> 36:51.360
Um, the, uh, once Schrab, Schrab said, do you know the thing about the prostate, right?

36:51.360 --> 36:57.520
And I said, no, what, what is the thing about the prostate?

36:57.520 --> 37:00.800
Should we get Rob up here to do his, well, we'll get him up in a second.

37:00.800 --> 37:04.480
I might have been to tell this butthole story, but, but, uh, as I guess this night just went

37:04.480 --> 37:08.200
to a weird black hole, like, uh, it was, it was about darkness.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.200
He said it.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.600
Yeah, I guess, but it's, it's kind of joyful.

37:10.600 --> 37:15.560
Um, I don't, I don't mind it so much if it's, it's a little relieving.

37:15.560 --> 37:19.320
Um, uh, I hope no one from CBS or Fox is here.

37:19.320 --> 37:28.400
Um, the, uh, you know, it's, you know, it's, you know, it's really weird is that, is that,

37:28.400 --> 37:31.640
is that, I don't, I don't know if he minds me saying this or just, Henry Kissinger's

37:31.640 --> 37:33.640
son is in the room.

37:33.640 --> 37:34.640
What?

37:34.640 --> 37:35.640
Yeah.

37:35.640 --> 37:36.640
All right.

37:36.640 --> 37:37.640
Uh, okay.

37:37.640 --> 37:46.640
I, Rob goes, you know, when you're jerking off, you can't just pass by that.

37:46.640 --> 37:51.520
All right, go on, go on.

37:51.520 --> 37:57.400
Uh, you're about to tell a sharpie up the butt story to Henry Kissinger's son.

37:57.400 --> 38:05.240
This Schrab, uh, tells you, yeah, when you're coming, you rub the, uh, you know, that what

38:05.240 --> 38:09.680
we would call the taint, what we would come to call the taint, uh, when we achieved that

38:09.680 --> 38:15.240
kind of word power, Rob's like, you know, you rub that part, when you're coming, you,

38:15.240 --> 38:16.680
you, it feels better.

38:16.680 --> 38:17.680
Come hard.

38:17.680 --> 38:18.680
Why do you keep looking at me?

38:18.680 --> 38:24.880
Who am I supposed to look at the, uh, that girl like that, like, wait, wait, wait, that

38:24.880 --> 38:31.040
fella, who, who, who should I look at while you chose me for a certain, well, I thought

38:31.040 --> 38:33.040
I could trust you.

38:33.040 --> 38:39.840
Uh, I'll just stare in the lights, look at me while you tell the story.

38:39.840 --> 38:43.800
So Rob said, when you're coming, you know, you, you, you rub the, you rub the, uh, little,

38:43.800 --> 38:49.200
the area between your, uh, your, your, your butt and your balls.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.600
It's, uh, it's a thing.

38:50.600 --> 38:51.880
It's like, it feels a little better.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.200
It's a, you're still, and I was like, I wonder why that is.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.200
What is that?

38:55.200 --> 38:56.200
It was a magic button there.

38:56.200 --> 39:02.240
I did a little research at the local library, actually, actually, I just happened upon it.

39:02.240 --> 39:05.480
I think it was like in a, in a, like a penthouse magazine or something.

39:05.480 --> 39:11.560
I said, this is a pre-internet world of, of, of delightful, uh, periodical literature.

39:11.560 --> 39:16.520
Um, and, uh, there was some guy wrote in a letter to playboy or penthouse or something

39:16.520 --> 39:22.920
and said, dear playboy, I, my girlfriend was, uh, uh, uh, uh, pleasuring me.

39:22.920 --> 39:26.680
And she started, she rubbed the area that Schrab was talking about.

39:26.680 --> 39:27.680
Rob Schrab.

39:27.680 --> 39:28.680
Rob Schrab.

39:28.680 --> 39:39.680
That is a great direct to video movie.

39:39.680 --> 39:44.040
Uh, have you seen Tate Master 2?

39:44.040 --> 39:45.040
Oh yeah.

39:45.040 --> 39:50.480
I, I, I didn't like it, but I heard Tate Master 3 is going to pretend Tate Master 2 didn't

39:50.480 --> 39:51.480
happen.

39:51.480 --> 39:54.880
It's so cool because I didn't like learning that Tate Master was an alien.

39:54.880 --> 40:00.120
I, I thought that he was a master of Tates that was earthbound and, uh, and, and could,

40:00.120 --> 40:02.560
and could speak to them and see through their eyes.

40:02.560 --> 40:05.360
Um, I've got that poster.

40:05.360 --> 40:06.360
It's amazing.

40:06.360 --> 40:10.280
This thing was interesting at Mark Singer, who was in Beastmaster.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.680
He had a, uh, have you watched Beastmaster?

40:12.680 --> 40:18.240
He has a very visible, very clear, uh, uh, uh, what is it, it's a smallpox vaccination

40:18.240 --> 40:19.240
thing.

40:19.240 --> 40:22.760
I just think that's interesting because it's like, he's the Beastmaster.

40:22.760 --> 40:26.440
He's, he's even a master of, of, of microscopic beasts.

40:26.440 --> 40:31.040
He, before anyone in this world had, uh, had vaccinations.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.040
He did.

40:32.040 --> 40:33.400
Uh, uh, all right.

40:33.400 --> 40:36.960
You 25 year old fuckers.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.800
Maybe educate yourselves a little bit.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.280
I don't want us to go down that road again.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.280
Who is Eddie Brackell?

40:43.280 --> 40:49.760
Uh, what's aerobics?

40:49.760 --> 40:50.760
All right.

40:50.760 --> 40:52.480
So Rob Schrab is rubbing your chain.

40:52.480 --> 40:57.320
That's, that's not, that's, that's why, that's, that's why you left off.

40:57.320 --> 41:01.320
I was, I was, it was that too.

41:01.320 --> 41:06.480
I read a letter in a magazine with the goddess.

41:06.480 --> 41:14.640
I read a letter in a magazine where a guy wrote into a magazine and said, uh, I, I,

41:14.640 --> 41:16.440
my girlfriend did this thing.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.960
She rubbed this spot and it, and something amazing happened.

41:19.960 --> 41:27.080
Uh, what can you explain on the doctor sex or whoever was writing into said, uh, oh,

41:27.080 --> 41:29.720
she's stimulating your prostate gland.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.280
Uh, uh, that's what's happening.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.360
Some people choose to do it internally.

41:34.360 --> 41:38.240
Uh, that's why people stick stuff up their butt sometime.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.440
That's what, that's the same thing.

41:40.440 --> 41:47.040
And so I thought, huh, like you with the fishnets, what, what am I going to die?

41:47.040 --> 41:50.640
Not having a, what if, what if, how do you know?

41:50.640 --> 41:53.280
I mean, what do you, what if it's my favorite thing?

41:53.280 --> 41:56.680
What if I turned into the guy that loves, why did you climb that mountain?

41:56.680 --> 41:57.680
Because it was there.

41:57.680 --> 41:58.680
You hear about it sometimes.

41:58.680 --> 42:02.600
You hear about guys liking the, liking stuff in their, uh, their hoo-ha.

42:02.600 --> 42:11.920
So I thought maybe I'm going to, so I, so at one point I'm, I'm going, I'm, I'm, I'm

42:11.920 --> 42:22.120
sitting down for a personal session, uh, and, uh, and, and, and, and I, and, and I think

42:22.120 --> 42:27.600
to myself, uh, uh, well, maybe, maybe this is the time I try to, I'll try to, I'll try

42:27.600 --> 42:32.280
to put something in there and see if it's like magic, you know, see if a genie comes

42:32.280 --> 42:41.080
out, um, go on.

42:41.080 --> 42:48.040
So I looked around my house because I did, I thought, well, I'm not going to put my finger

42:48.040 --> 42:49.040
in there.

42:49.040 --> 42:50.040
Yeah.

42:50.040 --> 42:55.840
Because it's, because it's a butt, that's gross.

42:55.840 --> 43:00.120
I don't want my, I don't want poopies on my finger.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.120
This is for the ladies.

43:01.120 --> 43:05.080
So I'm like, well, it's for an object time.

43:05.080 --> 43:15.040
So I, I look around and I'm like, I landed on a, uh, Sharpie pen, not, not the cap end,

43:15.040 --> 43:18.320
but the, just the, because the, there's the regular, just smooth, white end.

43:18.320 --> 43:19.320
That's what I'm talking about.

43:19.320 --> 43:24.920
I was like, well, this is a, this is a, this is a good starter, you know, like, start,

43:24.920 --> 43:25.920
start slow.

43:25.920 --> 43:31.080
Maybe I'll end up putting a thermos up there, but, uh, let's, let's find out.

43:31.080 --> 43:41.920
Uh, and so I, you know, the end of the story is I have a Sharpie pen stuck up my ass and

43:41.920 --> 43:45.640
I came and it wasn't that big a deal.

43:45.640 --> 43:48.600
Me, it might have been a little better.

43:48.600 --> 43:53.520
I mean, I can't remember, but what I do remember very clearly is there's a thing with guys,

43:53.520 --> 43:58.040
um, when God, this is something that's very amazing to me.

43:58.040 --> 44:04.720
When guys have an orgasm, it is instantaneous, like whatever was in your bloodstream, whatever

44:04.720 --> 44:12.440
was in your brain that was making you sexually pro, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, excited.

44:12.440 --> 44:15.560
Like it is literally in an instant.

44:15.560 --> 44:19.920
Like the moment of your orgasm, the guy, it's like the thought of sex is like mowing

44:19.920 --> 44:20.920
the lawn.

44:20.920 --> 44:24.200
It says it doesn't, it's everything goes away completely.

44:24.200 --> 44:28.920
You go from being like Dr. Detroit to being Dan Acheride.

44:28.920 --> 44:29.920
Wow.

44:29.920 --> 44:30.920
Fuck you guys.

44:30.920 --> 44:33.920
Just, just rent some shit.

44:33.920 --> 44:41.720
Dr. Detroit, now I'm turned on again.

44:41.720 --> 44:47.320
You go from being Mr. Hyde to back to having a PhD again, uh, as soon as you orgasm.

44:47.320 --> 44:54.920
So I came and I had a pin up my ass.

44:54.920 --> 44:57.160
I was just, that is the sweetest taboo.

44:57.160 --> 44:58.160
Thank you sir.

44:58.160 --> 45:10.200
Uh, I, I, I, there's nothing, I think you, you don't want, like, like you'll do almost

45:10.200 --> 45:14.480
anything when you're in that zone, like you'll, you'll, you're, you're, you're, it's, it does

45:14.480 --> 45:18.800
things to your mind and your, and your body, but then when it's all over, you don't want

45:18.800 --> 45:23.760
any props involved that, that, that are going to like take time and effort to deal with.

45:23.760 --> 45:29.640
Like I, I was a man who, you know, I was back to being a normal stockbroker.

45:29.640 --> 45:33.560
You know, just, I wasn't ever really a stockbroker.

45:33.560 --> 45:34.880
That would be embarrassing.

45:34.880 --> 45:39.160
Uh, I had a pin up my ass and I had to pull it out.

45:39.160 --> 45:40.160
Yeah.

45:40.160 --> 45:44.160
Well, wouldn't, wouldn't you rather I did, uh, so, so,

45:44.160 --> 45:48.440
So you didn't, you didn't want me to like pull it out now and go, and here it is.

45:48.440 --> 45:49.640
So when you come up after the show,

45:49.640 --> 45:51.320
Like a golden railroad spike,

45:51.320 --> 45:55.520
Well, after the show down and be signing autographs and pictures.

45:55.520 --> 45:56.600
Yes.

45:56.600 --> 46:00.640
I told the community writer's room that and there was no end of Sharpie jokes.

46:00.640 --> 46:01.640
Uh, yeah.

46:01.640 --> 46:04.480
Well, do you want, here, here's some things on the docket for tonight.

46:04.480 --> 46:05.480
All right.

46:05.480 --> 46:07.600
We got to have Spencer come up, our dungeon master.

46:07.600 --> 46:08.600
Oh fuck yeah.

46:08.600 --> 46:12.240
We're going to have Spencer come up and he's going to just talk to us, you and me.

46:12.240 --> 46:14.360
Spencer whom we met last, uh, last week.

46:14.360 --> 46:15.360
Yes.

46:15.360 --> 46:19.000
I said, I brought a dungeon master up on stage who volunteered to talk to us about Dungeons

46:19.000 --> 46:24.800
and Dragons and, and Spencer's going to come up, talk to us a little bit, uh, about, about

46:24.800 --> 46:29.040
the kinds of characters we might like to play in a Dungeons and Dragons game.

46:29.040 --> 46:33.960
And then he'll, he'll take his seat, uh, there, there's a lovely commemorative Sharpie

46:33.960 --> 46:41.800
pen under it for him, uh, he, he, he, he, and then, and then next week, then he'll,

46:41.800 --> 46:46.120
I get, you know, present our characters to us and that'll be another, you know, I gotta

46:46.120 --> 46:50.000
try to, it'll, it's, it's, it's a weekly step-by-step baby steps.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.560
I don't know where that's going to go.

46:51.560 --> 46:56.960
Are we going to end up playing Dungeons and Dragons on the, on the podcast here at Harmontown?

46:56.960 --> 47:01.600
Will we, three weeks from now, will we have a table up on stage and we'll just do a little

47:01.600 --> 47:06.680
segment where we do a little, little, little baby chapter of an adventure with a dungeon

47:06.680 --> 47:12.680
master, will Spencer be our dungeon master or, or having rolled our characters, you know,

47:12.680 --> 47:15.320
will he abdicate to that throne?

47:15.320 --> 47:20.880
Will we audition, as I suggested, we might other dungeon masters and each week and see

47:20.880 --> 47:22.560
how they, how they work for us.

47:22.560 --> 47:23.560
So I don't know.

47:23.560 --> 47:24.840
I don't plan that far ahead.

47:24.840 --> 47:26.320
I'm a bad planner.

47:26.320 --> 47:29.240
I stick pens up my ass.

47:29.240 --> 47:34.720
That was not a guy who is thinking about Wednesday on Monday.

47:34.720 --> 47:49.160
That's a, that is a man who deems his Carpe's new, please, please welcome to the stage for

47:49.160 --> 47:53.560
those of you who are here last week or listen to it last week, sorry, I totally blue balled

47:53.560 --> 47:54.960
your applause there.

47:54.960 --> 47:57.240
I'm sorry about that.

47:57.240 --> 48:02.760
But for those of you here last week or listening to it last week, we, you know, I said I want

48:02.760 --> 48:07.600
to play Dungeons and Dragons on the podcast, I think, I want to, somebody needs to roll

48:07.600 --> 48:08.600
characters for us.

48:08.600 --> 48:13.120
We, I needed immediately, I'm so out of touch with the world of Dungeons and Dragons.

48:13.120 --> 48:19.560
I haven't, I, I, I, I, the books I own are from 89 and thank you for applause for a year.

48:19.560 --> 48:26.840
It was applause for a year, someone applauded a year.

48:26.840 --> 48:28.040
So we brought this guy up.

48:28.040 --> 48:30.920
He shot his hand up when I said, who knows anything about Dungeons and Dragons?

48:30.920 --> 48:32.720
Who's a dungeon master?

48:32.720 --> 48:37.000
Spencer raised his hand coming up and, and so I talked to him after the show.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.320
I think we should edit all this out because I'm explaining a bunch of redundant bullshit.

48:40.320 --> 48:46.360
But let's, let's, let's bring our character, the guy who's going to create Jeff and I's

48:46.360 --> 48:49.400
first level Dungeons and Dragons characters to the stage.

48:49.400 --> 48:52.400
It's Spencer, everybody, bring him up.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.400
How's it going?

48:54.400 --> 48:57.400
Here he is.

48:57.400 --> 49:07.760
Now at risk, Jeff, you're like, for those listening, do we want to describe Spencer?

49:07.760 --> 49:09.960
He really does scream dungeon master.

49:09.960 --> 49:14.120
I would say, what, six, five, four, how tall are you?

49:14.120 --> 49:15.120
Six, four.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.120
Six, four.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.120
Six, four.

49:17.120 --> 49:27.360
Bearded, hair, pretty long, metallica length hair, lower, lower scapula length.

49:27.360 --> 49:33.920
He's a, he's bespectacled and kind of like, you know, intellectual small glasses.

49:33.920 --> 49:37.800
He's got a, a t-shirt, some plaid shorts, he's very casually dressed.

49:37.800 --> 49:44.240
I, you know, I, I would have pictured a top hat and a cloak, but I mean, but it's a podcast.

49:44.240 --> 49:45.920
There's different kinds of dungeon master.

49:45.920 --> 49:48.880
I mean, this is, this is the, well edit that part out.

49:48.880 --> 49:52.560
He's a, he has a leather top hat and goggles on, on the, the goggles aren't in his face.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.120
They're on the hat.

49:54.120 --> 50:00.000
And he's wearing a jacket that goes down to the floor and there's 18 buckles on it.

50:00.000 --> 50:05.240
He has pockets on each arm, each of which are clearly carrying a weapon.

50:05.240 --> 50:08.960
And he has a dice satchel.

50:08.960 --> 50:09.960
That's not true.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.440
No, we want, I want people to really know.

50:11.440 --> 50:13.440
He's a very casual dungeon master.

50:13.440 --> 50:25.760
He looks like a, a, a, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's casual Friday at the Norse Pillager village

50:25.760 --> 50:26.760
on the Viking ship.

50:26.760 --> 50:27.760
Yes.

50:27.760 --> 50:28.760
It's, it's, it's biz casual.

50:28.760 --> 50:29.760
It's fried during the Norman invasion.

50:29.760 --> 50:34.760
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's laundry day on Eric the Red's boat.

50:34.760 --> 50:35.760
Right.

50:35.760 --> 50:39.280
It's a, it's a big, big bushy beard, six foot four.

50:39.280 --> 50:44.000
Only of the month, uh, 1524.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Okay.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
All right.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.800
So Spencer, uh, the, the, the, the, the, all our, our goal right now for this conversation,

50:49.800 --> 50:53.920
all we want to do is just, we want to talk about the kinds of characters Jeff and I would

50:53.920 --> 50:54.920
like to play.

50:54.920 --> 50:59.320
Now there's not a lot of like two person campaigns is there in Dungeons and Dragons.

50:59.320 --> 51:00.320
That's not really a common thing.

51:00.320 --> 51:03.160
I don't think it's too common, but it does end up happening.

51:03.160 --> 51:04.160
Yeah.

51:04.160 --> 51:09.440
Well, it's, it's, it's, sometimes you don't have any friends.

51:09.440 --> 51:10.440
Yeah.

51:10.440 --> 51:11.440
Exactly.

51:11.440 --> 51:17.320
If there's one contingency, we have the role playing ilk, uh, have to prepare ourselves

51:17.320 --> 51:20.600
for, it's, uh, it's less people showing up than we thought.

51:20.600 --> 51:25.000
Can I just say like two pens and a real doll ago, I was like, they're going to think I'm

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
a loser.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
You're welcome.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
You're welcome.

51:28.000 --> 51:33.000
You're like Carrie Grant up here.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.680
Uh, yeah, I am not a, uh, yeah, I am, uh, I am a nerd's nerd.

51:38.680 --> 51:41.120
Have you ever tried on stockings and put a pen in your butt Spencer?

51:41.120 --> 51:43.480
Can't say that I have, but I'm interested.

51:43.480 --> 51:44.480
Yeah.

51:44.480 --> 51:47.480
What a square.

51:47.480 --> 51:49.600
Uh, all right.

51:49.600 --> 51:50.600
So yeah.

51:50.600 --> 51:51.600
So it happens.

51:51.600 --> 51:57.760
I think that, uh, uh, when, because I know that in creating, uh, parties of Dungeons and

51:57.760 --> 52:00.160
Dragons characters, what you want is a kind of balance.

52:00.160 --> 52:06.120
Like it's possible for Jeff and I to both be magic users or, but, and both, or both

52:06.120 --> 52:10.800
be fighters, but we'd probably want to, we probably want to balance ourselves a little.

52:10.800 --> 52:11.800
Yeah.

52:11.800 --> 52:19.160
You want some like, uh, some heavy meat to take some damage and, uh, some, yeah, you

52:19.160 --> 52:21.160
want to balance.

52:21.160 --> 52:22.160
Sweetest taboo.

52:22.160 --> 52:24.920
Uh, I've never played this.

52:24.920 --> 52:27.280
I have no idea what either of you two are talking about.

52:27.280 --> 52:28.280
All right.

52:28.280 --> 52:29.280
Well, let's walk them through it Spencer.

52:29.280 --> 52:32.800
So if I'm assuming that the third edition of Dungeons and Dragons has a change, has

52:32.800 --> 52:38.480
a change to the fundamentals of phrase was like, there's class, class is like occupation.

52:38.480 --> 52:39.480
There's fighter.

52:39.480 --> 52:40.480
Oh, you, you listen.

52:40.480 --> 52:41.480
All right.

52:41.480 --> 52:42.480
Yeah.

52:42.480 --> 52:43.920
So mostly it's just like classes.

52:43.920 --> 52:46.800
There's the barbarian, which is, you know, a barbarian.

52:46.800 --> 52:51.740
There's a bard which tells magical stories and can cast spells and cause people to double

52:51.740 --> 52:54.200
over and painful laughter.

52:54.200 --> 52:56.040
There's a clerics.

52:56.040 --> 52:58.320
They channel their power of their gods.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.640
Let's see, uh, druids.

53:00.640 --> 53:06.640
They're kind of like hippies, but with magic, um, you got fighters, they have big swords

53:06.640 --> 53:07.640
and whatnot.

53:07.640 --> 53:09.640
You got, uh, let's see here.

53:09.640 --> 53:10.640
All right.

53:10.640 --> 53:12.600
You got monks, which are kind of like martial artists.

53:12.600 --> 53:14.360
You like Jackie Chan kind of people.

53:14.360 --> 53:20.000
You got your rain, no, you got your paladins, which, you know, they smite evil in the name

53:20.000 --> 53:22.800
of their gods and are usually jerks.

53:22.800 --> 53:25.320
There's, uh, Rangers.

53:25.320 --> 53:31.120
I think it's hand shot up when he heard that description.

53:31.120 --> 53:34.000
You got the Rangers, which is like Lego loss from Lord of the Rings.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
He's got a bow.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.840
He uses two swords, you know, that sort of thing.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.200
Um, and they're kind of nature experts.

53:40.200 --> 53:41.200
Yeah.

53:41.200 --> 53:42.200
They got, they can hunt there.

53:42.200 --> 53:46.600
They can, uh, have beast pets sort of thing like Beastmaster.

53:46.600 --> 53:47.800
Yeah.

53:47.800 --> 53:49.800
Like Taintmaster.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.800
Almost.

53:51.800 --> 53:55.280
Uh, wait, is that, uh, are those thieves?

53:55.280 --> 53:56.280
Thieves and assassins?

53:56.280 --> 53:57.280
Yeah.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.280
There's thieves, which are rogues.

53:58.280 --> 54:02.520
They can be like assassins or just thieves, you know, stealing stuff or sneaking on high

54:02.520 --> 54:03.520
ledges.

54:03.520 --> 54:07.880
I'm going to go for, um, what's a barbarian do?

54:07.880 --> 54:12.280
Barbarians fly into dangerous rages in which they shrug off even the fiercest of damage.

54:12.280 --> 54:13.280
I'll take that.

54:13.280 --> 54:14.280
I'm a barbarian.

54:14.280 --> 54:15.280
All right.

54:15.280 --> 54:16.280
Sounds good.

54:16.280 --> 54:17.280
So then I definitely, I feel like, I feel like-

54:17.280 --> 54:18.280
Can I wear a suit?

54:18.280 --> 54:19.960
Can I be a barbarian in a suit?

54:19.960 --> 54:20.960
Yeah.

54:20.960 --> 54:21.960
Yeah.

54:21.960 --> 54:22.960
No.

54:22.960 --> 54:23.960
It could be like ripped, you know, cut off like slacks.

54:23.960 --> 54:25.960
That's a librarian.

54:25.960 --> 54:39.520
Uh, uh, the, uh, I should offset that then with like a spell casting kind of occupation.

54:39.520 --> 54:40.520
Yeah.

54:40.520 --> 54:41.520
Like a bard or a druid or a wizard.

54:41.520 --> 54:45.360
You know, I think I'm just going to go straight up the middle because it's like, you've got

54:45.360 --> 54:49.960
a barbarian and then I should, I should be a cleric or magic user.

54:49.960 --> 54:50.960
Yeah.

54:50.960 --> 54:51.960
A cleric or druid.

54:51.960 --> 54:55.240
Okay, I'm going to say magic users so that we have some offensive capability between the

54:55.240 --> 54:56.240
two of us.

54:56.240 --> 54:57.240
Thank you.

54:57.240 --> 54:59.680
Give a little bit of applause there from Rob Schrab.

54:59.680 --> 55:02.200
Uh, so then there's class.

55:02.200 --> 55:03.280
That's the first choice you make.

55:03.280 --> 55:04.280
So we've done that.

55:04.280 --> 55:05.280
Then there's race.

55:05.280 --> 55:06.280
Yeah.

55:06.280 --> 55:07.280
My favorite.

55:07.280 --> 55:11.120
The most exciting thing in the world to me.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.120
Uh-

55:12.120 --> 55:14.960
You're a, you're a Filipino bard.

55:14.960 --> 55:15.960
Yeah.

55:15.960 --> 55:18.560
You want to run down the races?

55:18.560 --> 55:19.560
Yeah.

55:19.560 --> 55:21.280
You got, um, well, I mean humans.

55:21.280 --> 55:22.280
Those are us.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.280
Um.

55:23.280 --> 55:26.280
Oh, he's good.

55:26.280 --> 55:30.560
The right man for the job.

55:30.560 --> 55:32.880
You got your elves.

55:32.880 --> 55:33.960
Most people know what elves are.

55:33.960 --> 55:34.960
They live in trees.

55:34.960 --> 55:35.960
They like bows and arrows.

55:35.960 --> 55:39.200
They're taught what some people think elves are a little shrimpy, shrimpy, shrimpy people.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.200
I make cookies.

55:40.200 --> 55:41.200
Yeah.

55:41.200 --> 55:42.800
Like, like, this isn't a Kepler elf.

55:42.800 --> 55:43.800
Is there?

55:43.800 --> 55:44.800
Well, actually, yeah.

55:44.800 --> 55:45.800
Lord of the Rings.

55:45.800 --> 55:47.800
Now everybody knows that it's a Orlando bloom.

55:47.800 --> 55:48.800
Okay.

55:48.800 --> 55:55.200
You got, uh, half elves, which are half human, half elf, loved by all.

55:55.200 --> 55:56.200
They're accepted.

55:56.200 --> 55:57.200
Okay.

55:57.200 --> 55:58.520
That's just true.

55:58.520 --> 55:59.520
That's the game.

55:59.520 --> 56:00.520
Okay.

56:00.520 --> 56:01.520
Don't hate the role-player.

56:01.520 --> 56:02.520
Uh, okay.

56:02.520 --> 56:03.520
Uh.

56:03.520 --> 56:11.640
You got half elf, or no, halflings, which are rarely, really short people.

56:11.640 --> 56:20.960
Kind of like toddlers, if they looked old.

56:20.960 --> 56:25.240
I think I'll, I think I'll, I think I'll be a human, I'm gonna be a human magic user.

56:25.240 --> 56:26.240
Pussy.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.240
All right.

56:28.240 --> 56:32.640
This, this dwarf barbarian is going to beat your ass.

56:32.640 --> 56:34.880
Am I a gnome or a dwarf?

56:34.880 --> 56:35.880
You're probably a gnome.

56:35.880 --> 56:37.840
You could be a dwarf, but that's less hilarious.

56:37.840 --> 56:38.840
No.

56:38.840 --> 56:39.840
Nope, it is.

56:39.840 --> 56:44.000
And the, and the, and the rest of it, you know, unless we have any specific requests

56:44.000 --> 56:47.200
that we want to talk about, like I've got concepts that we want to, because part of

56:47.200 --> 56:51.600
your job now as a dungeon master, from what I understand is, he's going to go roll our

56:51.600 --> 56:52.600
characters.

56:52.600 --> 56:53.600
This is a comedy show.

56:53.600 --> 56:57.800
So some of it involves actual die-rolling, like, like, you know, like, like generating

56:57.800 --> 57:01.520
our attributes, which are strength, intelligence, wisdom, charisma, I'm assuming.

57:01.520 --> 57:02.520
Stop me if I'm wrong.

57:02.520 --> 57:03.520
No, those are all right.

57:03.520 --> 57:04.520
Yeah.

57:04.520 --> 57:05.520
Uh, okay.

57:05.520 --> 57:10.080
And we could, we could turn you loose now and you could, you could, you could roll as first-level

57:10.080 --> 57:11.080
characters.

57:11.080 --> 57:12.080
We're going to be very weak.

57:12.080 --> 57:14.640
Uh, and we're going to have a kind of, and then, and then we'll, you'll present them

57:14.640 --> 57:15.640
to us next week.

57:15.640 --> 57:16.640
You go, here's your character.

57:16.640 --> 57:19.800
So maybe, maybe we, maybe we should come up with our names, Jeff.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.960
I'm going to guess you're going to be Mission Nightblade.

57:21.960 --> 57:25.080
No, I'm not, because I'm going to be a magic user.

57:25.080 --> 57:30.200
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'll come up with my name, uh, right now.

57:30.200 --> 57:31.200
No.

57:31.200 --> 57:34.920
No, no, what do you think Spencer, do we come up with them now or do we, do we, do you come

57:34.920 --> 57:36.720
back with these characters that are nameless?

57:36.720 --> 57:37.920
You should come up with a name now.

57:37.920 --> 57:38.920
You know how about this?

57:38.920 --> 57:41.800
Uh, let's let the audience tonight name our characters.

57:41.800 --> 57:42.800
Okay.

57:42.800 --> 57:43.800
All right.

57:43.800 --> 57:44.800
Uh, I want, uh, let's see.

57:44.800 --> 57:45.800
Uh, you right here, sir.

57:45.800 --> 57:46.800
Hold your hand there.

57:46.800 --> 57:47.800
And then you miss right there.

57:47.800 --> 57:49.800
I want you to put your hand there, right there.

57:49.800 --> 57:50.800
Yeah.

57:50.800 --> 57:51.800
Yeah.

57:51.800 --> 57:56.760
I want, uh, you to give me my first name and I want you to make it, uh, uh, know me.

57:56.760 --> 57:59.440
Like, you know, like something that, that, that to think of whatever a gnomes name would

57:59.440 --> 58:01.440
be and you, something barbaric.

58:01.440 --> 58:02.440
Okay.

58:02.440 --> 58:04.880
And on the count of three, I want you to say what you're thinking right now.

58:04.880 --> 58:07.560
So you, sir, give me the gnomes first name.

58:07.560 --> 58:10.080
Yours, ma'am, are the barbaric last name.

58:10.080 --> 58:11.080
Ready?

58:11.080 --> 58:12.080
One, two, three.

58:12.080 --> 58:13.080
Quirk.

58:13.080 --> 58:14.080
Quirk.

58:14.080 --> 58:15.080
All right.

58:15.080 --> 58:16.080
I am quirk.

58:16.080 --> 58:17.080
Okay.

58:17.080 --> 58:18.080
All right.

58:18.080 --> 58:19.080
That's fucking backfire.

58:19.080 --> 58:20.080
Yeah.

58:20.080 --> 58:21.080
I think I'll just call you a quirk probably.

58:21.080 --> 58:22.080
Yeah.

58:22.080 --> 58:23.080
I don't know.

58:23.080 --> 58:28.080
I, I, I, I, we'll be on a first name basis for most of the time.

58:28.080 --> 58:35.080
Uh, I, uh, uh, I'm from a long line of magic user, magic user, Sharpie, Sharpie, so, so

58:35.080 --> 58:39.480
Sharpie Buttsalot, Sharpie Buttsalot.

58:39.480 --> 58:40.480
Okay.

58:40.480 --> 58:41.480
All right.

58:41.480 --> 58:42.480
Okay.

58:42.480 --> 58:43.480
Okay.

58:43.480 --> 58:44.480
Okay.

58:44.480 --> 58:45.480
Okay.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.480
Okay.

58:46.480 --> 58:47.480
Okay.

58:47.480 --> 58:48.480
Okay.

58:48.480 --> 58:49.480
Okay.

58:49.480 --> 58:50.480
Okay.

58:50.480 --> 58:51.480
Okay.

58:51.480 --> 58:52.480
Okay.

58:52.480 --> 58:53.480
Okay.

58:53.480 --> 58:54.480
Okay.

58:54.480 --> 58:55.480
Okay.

58:55.480 --> 58:56.480
Okay.

58:56.480 --> 58:57.480
Okay.

58:57.480 --> 58:58.480
Okay.

58:58.480 --> 58:59.480
Okay.

58:59.480 --> 59:00.480
Okay.

59:00.480 --> 59:01.480
Okay.

59:01.480 --> 59:02.480
All right.

59:02.480 --> 59:03.480
No, no wrong answers.

59:03.480 --> 59:04.480
Sharp, Sharpie Buttsalot.

59:04.480 --> 59:05.480
The magic user.

59:05.480 --> 59:07.480
We're definitely starting off on the right foot.

59:07.480 --> 59:08.480
Okay.

59:08.480 --> 59:09.480
All right.

59:09.480 --> 59:10.480
Well, uh, let's have a hand for Spencer.

59:10.480 --> 59:12.480
He's going to go do some hard work for us.

59:12.480 --> 59:13.480
Spencer.

59:13.480 --> 59:23.480
And, uh, thank you, Spencer.

59:23.480 --> 59:24.480
Yeah.

59:24.480 --> 59:25.480
He's going to go do those characters in the next week.

59:25.480 --> 59:29.480
He'll, he'll, he'll come to us with what he's created and then we'll, we'll just examine

59:29.480 --> 59:33.480
them and that'll be, we'll probably won't start playing next week, but then, then we'll,

59:33.480 --> 59:36.480
because then we'll have time to, uh, I'm not going to produce the show in front of you

59:36.480 --> 59:37.480
guys.

59:37.480 --> 59:38.480
We'll talk about it later.

59:38.480 --> 59:43.480
Um, we should, we should do rapid fire.

59:43.480 --> 59:46.480
Let's get these fashion questions out and then, and then let's send these people on their

59:46.480 --> 59:47.480
merry way.

59:47.480 --> 59:48.480
It's Friday night.

59:48.480 --> 59:49.480
They got to.

59:49.480 --> 59:50.480
We're not going to hear Rob's butt story or no?

59:50.480 --> 59:52.480
Well, I don't think, I just don't think it's time.

59:52.480 --> 59:56.480
Rob washed his butt too much and, uh, all right, Schrab, come up.

59:56.480 --> 59:57.480
Okay.

59:57.480 --> 59:59.480
How can you, can you do the, yeah.

59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.480
You want the short version?

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.480
Yeah.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.480
Yeah.

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.480
What's the short version?

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480
Oh gosh.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.480
I don't remember to remind me how did, how did this all get started?

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.480
By the way.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.480
It all got city seats in the building.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.480
I know.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.480
I don't know why they put chairs.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.480
These are reserved.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.480
Yeah.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.480
These are reserved.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.280
Well, also that's part of that's my fault.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.280
Rob's describing.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.480
This is, this is your view the entire time.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.480
Yeah.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.480
The entire stage right here at the show, uh, audience left.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.480
You look at the back of Dan's head most of the show.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.480
Yeah.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480
What is that?

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.480
It's my fault.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.480
It's also my fault because I tend to talk to Jeff because I'm insecure.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.480
That's okay.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.480
And so then you're looking at my tight pass.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.480
Also, uh, at everything is, uh, terror, uh, everything is festival.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.480
Uh, Joel in cinematic Titanic is going to be on Sunday.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.480
Oh, okay.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.480
So go to see that because it's super hilarious.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:48.480
It's, it's important to mention that our hero and mentor Joel Hodgson from Mystery Science

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:55.480
Theater is here.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:00.480
Joel Hodgson, truly a God among, among nerds and even some regular people.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:06.480
Uh, Joel, Joel was when, when, when, when I moved to LA, we were strangers in a strange

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.480
land.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.480
We had no idea what we were doing.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.480
And this other guy from the Midwest who we worshiped, uh, when we were in Milwaukee because

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480
we loved his show.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.480
Uh, you know, he, he, he was out here in LA too and he showed, you know, he was a big

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.480
part of making us comfortable out here, you know, explaining to us like how disgusting

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.480
he could be out here and, and preparing us for that.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.480
Uh, and he's a, he's a good standup guy.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.480
He's a great guy.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.480
I miss him like the Dickens.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.480
Missing, missing, missing Dickens.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.480
Uh, anyways.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.480
You mean it's, you make the whole taint thing sound like we were like some serious chuck

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.480
and buck shit.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.480
Hey man, you know what you got to do?

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:48.480
You got to rub that taint when you're jerking off, it's not like that at all.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.480
We were, I would be Chuck, right?

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480
Right?

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.480
That's important to you.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.480
That's really petty.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.480
That's really petty, Rob.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.480
He's thinner, right?

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480
He's thinner.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.480
All right.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.480
But what, what, I mean, there's several chapter decades.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.480
Stop me when you want to take over.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.480
Okay.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.480
That at some point in his life became obsessive about cleaning his anus.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.480
That was, I, I, that, that, that was an uncharismatic.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.480
Is that a really, is that a really a bad thing?

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.480
But no, no, of course not.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.480
It's what's bad is how late in life I became upset.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.480
You decided that you weren't.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.480
Yeah.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:30.480
That you would, I don't think my mom potty trained me properly because I remember, I

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.480
remember, I remember like, I don't know what it was.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:40.480
I don't know if my mom said it, but I got it in my head that all you had to do is wipe

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.480
three times.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.480
All the sealant if you want me.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.480
Press out the pipe.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.480
If you wipe three times, I was never taught to look at the tissue.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.480
I was a kid.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.480
It was like wipe three times.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.480
All the sealant if you want me.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.480
And then, and then flush.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:05.480
And the toilet paper magically makes the poop go away.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:10.480
Which is not true if you've ever tried to get a peanut butter off the carpet.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:14.480
So then you felt it at a time and you.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.480
Don't take three wipes.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.480
What, what, what?

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.480
Don't take three wipes.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.480
What goes on in Wisconsin by the way.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.480
He is right.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.480
He's crazy over there.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.480
So, but that's, that's the, that's the setup is that.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.480
So you started, what you started doing is you started like really kind of.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.480
Going for it.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.480
Yeah.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.480
Like really washing it.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.480
Making up for 20 years because I.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480
God.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.480
I can't, I can't tell why.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.480
Yes, I can.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.480
Okay.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.480
So as a joke.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.480
Oh man.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.480
I'm so sorry, honey.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.480
I'm so.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.480
You, you, she's married to you now.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480
She can't do anything.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.480
I want to stay married.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.480
She's not going to divorce you for.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.480
Oh God.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.480
Telling how you clean your.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:02.480
So anyway, as a joke back in the dead ale wives days, when we would show our balls and our

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.480
dicks and stuff like that, it was the funniest thing in the world.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.480
We thought we invented that.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.480
Yeah.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:15.480
I dropped my pants and I, I don't know, grabbed a towel and I wiped it and it was shockingly

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.480
dirt.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.480
It's soiled.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:24.480
And our, everybody goes, nobody's more embarrassed than I am.

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:30.480
And then our good friend, Sean McKenna, like looked at me who would pull his dick out and

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.480
pee on your shoe as a joke and stuff.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.480
Look at me.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.480
Yeah.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.480
Sean had a bit.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.480
He would do called the Star Wars trilogy where he would do, he would do three things with

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.480
his penis.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.480
Like, like he would do it.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.480
He would make it a lightsaber with a pen light and he would pretend it was Jabba the hut

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:51.480
by making his ballsack talk and then for an empire, he would, he, he, he would, he would

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.480
tuck it into its own force.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:59.480
And then pretend it was the, the, the, the big reptile creature trying to swallow the

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:04.480
Millennium Falcon as the, his pinky was the Millennium Falcon as it flew away and it would,

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.480
he would, he would let his package like unpackage.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:14.480
The point being, Sean McKenna is not someone that you want that from, you know, derision,

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.480
you don't take it lightly.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:22.480
Like I said, that, that pre pulled fiction comedy just was so easy back then.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:28.480
What, like he had a, he had an impression of Jimmy Durante that could, that was great.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.480
Yeah, he involved a pair of glasses in his dick.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.480
Yeah.

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.480
His closer was Jimmy Sneezy.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.480
Yeah.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.480
Sometimes Jimmy had a cold.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.480
Let's move on.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:44.480
So anyway, the guy, the guy who would do that, I, I, as a joke, as a joke.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:55.480
As a joke, I wiped my ass and, and Sean goes, Jesus Christ.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:59.480
Do you ever wipe your ass?

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:05.480
And it was like, it didn't make sense to me until that moment.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:14.480
But my, somebody hit rewind on the, on the VCR in my head and I rewound like from 24 to

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.480
4 going, oh my God.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:24.480
I am the most disgusting person in the world and things started making sense.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:29.480
The dots were connected and I was like, oh my God.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.480
I think it's probably, I don't have a girlfriend.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.480
But after that, I was, I went for it.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.480
I was like washing, it was, it was scrubbing.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.480
It just, just like, to OCD.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.480
And that escalated.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.480
Like we, because we found a, he could get special shower heads.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.480
When Kate, yes.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:51.480
Kate, when we first moved in, Kate, because she was the best girlfriend in the world and

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:56.480
now is the most amazing wife in the world, please applaud.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.480
Kate Freund.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:05.480
Kate Freund married to the tank master.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:11.480
She, she buys me as, I think it was like a birthday present or a Christmas present,

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.480
like a shower snake.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.480
You know what it would, you know where you attach it so you could do it.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.480
Just so I could really wash my ass.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.480
Because you wanted to, because she wanted you to.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.480
No, no, no, no, no.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.480
She knew it would make you happy.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:31.480
And, and because I don't know, I got it in my head that the hotter the water, the cleaner

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.480
it would be.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.480
Makes sense.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.480
And, and you know.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480
Works for dishes.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.480
Right.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.480
Yeah.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.480
That's what I did.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.480
Yeah.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.480
That's what I was thinking.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:49.480
So I, like, I remember, I remember there was a point where I was like, I have my leg up.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.480
I have a leg up.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.480
I know.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.480
You dressed like a woman.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.480
I invited people.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.480
What?

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.480
You put on fishnets.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.480
Yeah, I look good.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:05.480
I remember, I'm in the shower, my leg hiked up, spraying.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:10.480
And at the other, and the other hand is slowly turning up the heat.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.480
So I'm going.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.480
And, and going.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.480
Ah.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.480
Ah.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.480
Like.

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.480
Try again.

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.480
One pill makes you happy.

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.480
Yeah, just really trying.

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:36.480
Because I was trying to, to, to boil away 20 years worth of disgusting, terrible hygiene.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:45.480
And I remember we went, I remember like one, one time I went, I went really too far.

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:48.480
And I think I got like an instant message.

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.480
Well, that was like the night before New Year's.

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:59.480
Because we went to, we went to Vegas with, with Davis and, and, and like Akiva, Akiva

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:06.480
Shaffer was there and, and Drew Carey was there and, and I was like, well, it's, were

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.480
you, were you there?

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.480
Okay.

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.480
Were we dating it?

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.480
Okay.

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.480
All right.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.480
Well, it's New Year's Eve.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.480
All right.

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480
Time to.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.480
On the top patent tails here, let's just really clean it up.

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.480
And I remember.

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.480
Did we drive?

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.480
We drove there, right?

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:27.480
I don't know.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:37.480
Somewhere between the shower and the stroke of midnight, things just, just were not right

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.480
with the Taint Master.

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:49.240
It was, oh gee, and it was like, I, I scalded my entire, like, I just was like for a month,

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.600
I was just like, good heavens.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.080
So you went to this doctor.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.080
That's the story that I.

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.080
Okay.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.080
Wait.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.080
That's, I didn't know.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.080
That's the prologue?

01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.080
Yeah.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.080
That's the prologue.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:09.200
That's the, that's the crawl before we go to Tatooine.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:16.680
This is a dark day for the rebellion or hot or hot.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680
It could be hot.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680
It could be hot.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.680
Oh, they don't even know.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680
This is probably hot.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.240
Your asshole needed to go to hot to cool down.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:31.280
So I, so I didn't have a doctor at the time and Kate helps me find like this, find this.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.280
It was the worst.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:36.400
I had this terrible Armenian doctor that I went in there.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.400
Which is it?

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.400
That's not.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.400
It's just it was Armenian.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.400
It was terrible and Armenian.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.400
That's not like Irish medicine.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:51.520
It just, it just, and I went in there and I, I didn't sit down and he, he's like, oh,

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.400
why, what's, what's wrong with you?

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.400
I mean, it's.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:02.640
He studied, he studied, he went to school in that below you, I think.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.400
Was it, was it, was his name Boyardian?

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.400
Oh, what's that?

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.400
Oh, what's so wrong with you?

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.400
What's the wrong?

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.400
Dr. Boyardian.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.400
You're needed in the meatball ward.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.400
So we are dating.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.400
So we talk for a really long time.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.400
He says, so, so what's, what's the, what's the problem?

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.400
And I'm like, and I'm like, well, I think there's.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.400
He might not have been Armenian by the way.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.400
I think, I think I can't do an Armenian accent.

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.400
So I just do Italian.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:38.400
Oh, was he jumping over barrels?

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:44.400
His secretary was a giant gorilla.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:52.400
Who had plus signs for teeth.

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:56.400
And so, so we talk about it for a while.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:03.400
So, well, I think, I think I got something going on down there and I'm worried about it.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:13.400
I'm trying to find out if there's a way that we can do something about it without me showing my butt.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:14.400
Not going to happen.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.400
So, so he's like, well, why don't you take off your clothes and get up on the table.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:27.400
So I'm like, that's a spicy butthole.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:32.400
Mama mia, marron.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:42.400
So, so I get on, I get on the table and I'm naked.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.400
I'm naked.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:48.400
I'm naked and I'm on all fours.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.400
And we have a conversation with my nuts.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.400
Like, he's like, look in there.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.400
And he goes, all right, let's see what the problem is.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:07.400
And he goes, oh my, what did you do?

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:11.400
Mama mia.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:16.400
And I try to act like, what, what's going on?

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.400
What are you guys going on down there?

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:25.400
And he's like, oh, it's all colored, discolored and everything.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:29.400
And I'm like, what, what, like blue?

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.400
What's going on?

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.400
And he's like, oh, okay.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:39.400
Well, he, and he prescribes like all this, this junk that I'm supposed to put on there.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.400
All right.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.400
Well, yeah.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.400
So go to found crap.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.400
Yes.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.400
Go to, go to found crap.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.400
I think it's terrible.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.400
Take master everybody.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.400
Cinematic Titanium with Joel Hudson this Sunday.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.400
That's monster house writer Rob Straub taking the stage.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.400
All right.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.400
We're going to, we're going to end this show with a speed round.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.400
Yeah.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.400
We got to do, I feel bad because people write these questions and then they're like,

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.400
there's a lot of good ones.

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.400
Our audience is the bad.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.400
You guys ask the best.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.400
You're really good at this.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.400
This, we have you write stuff down on pieces of paper and you're always so cooperative

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.400
and so sincere and like really cool about it.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.400
I want to reward you for that and not punish that.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.400
I'm sorry.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:20.400
It's, you know, we, we, we ran uncharacteristically long.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.400
But I do want to tend to them.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.400
All right.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.400
Here we go.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.400
Ladies and gentlemen, the theme tonight was fashion and style.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.400
This is the speed round.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.400
Dan, I want you to keep your answers as terse and as succinct as possible.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.400
Here we go.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.400
Should we get a number of words?

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.400
You want to pick?

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.400
You pick.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.400
Okay.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.400
Let's do, let's do three word answers.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.400
Three word answers.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.400
So Zach holds up three fingers because he's like, I got a pork chop with my name on it

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.400
at home.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.400
Zach, our technician says three words.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400
Here we go.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.400
It's starting off speed round.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:56.400
Is it all right to wear a white, to wear a white fedora after labor day?

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.400
Yes.

01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.400
Surree Bob.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:06.400
Is it ever okay to wear a pattern tie with an Argyle vest?

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.400
Yes.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400
Surree Bob.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400
All right.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.400
Okay.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:11.400
This one's a little more abstract.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.400
Ted Nugent or Gary Busey?

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.400
From a fashion standpoint.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.400
Obviously Gary Busey.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.400
All right.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:24.000
What do you think of people who wear glasses to look nerdy or cute when they don't even

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.400
need them because they have fucking 2020?

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.400
Meow.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:38.400
Glasses lady.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:45.400
Have you ever considered beard braiding?

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.400
Just yesterday.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.400
Yes.

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.400
I'm sorry.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:57.400
Why do hipsters dress like Steve Urkel?

01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.400
The alternatives worse.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400
Nice.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.400
No, apparently not.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:08.400
At what point does a t-shirt need to be thrown out?

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:16.400
More stains.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:25.400
Happening.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.400
That one was brought to you by...

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:30.400
Nike.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.400
Tonto.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:36.400
Where do you buy your clothes?

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.400
My girlfriend's purchase.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:44.400
What should one wear to a bar mitzvah?

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:50.400
Probably a yamaka.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.400
All right.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.400
Here's a tough one, Dan.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.400
Here's a tough one.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.400
What shoes go with a narrow cut tapered black suit?

01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.400
Adidas.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.400
Adidas.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.400
Thank you so much.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:10.400
Hope we didn't take too much of your Friday night.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.400
Go have some fun.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.400
Thank you.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.400
You were a great crowd.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.400
We love you dearly.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.400
Try not to judge me too much for what I've said tonight.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.400
