WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.880
It's 8 o'clock Pacific Standard Time and you know what time that is.

00:29.880 --> 00:35.640
It's Harmon Time, ladies and gentlemen from beautiful uptown Burbank.

00:35.640 --> 00:39.640
Harmontown is now in session.

00:39.640 --> 00:44.440
Please welcome to the stage your Game Master, extra denerra.

00:44.440 --> 00:56.280
Spencer Crittenden, you got a bag full of fun, a fun full of bag, and there's, do you, do

00:56.280 --> 00:58.280
you beard get sexier?

00:58.280 --> 01:14.040
Oh, let's hear it for your mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:14.040 --> 01:19.640
Poop in your shoe, poop in your hat, poop on a ball, poop on a bat, poop on your head,

01:19.640 --> 01:24.240
poop in some bread, poop on your momma, now she's dead a bit, went to the La Brea Tower

01:24.240 --> 01:29.160
pizza, took a poop, invited papers to get the scoop, but papers are dead and journalism

01:29.160 --> 01:30.160
is long gone.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.720
I fucked your momma so hard, the pussy's a front lawn, and then I mowed it, I made

01:33.720 --> 01:38.400
it clean, but it's not about shaving, it's not what I mean, it's not about objectifying

01:38.400 --> 01:39.400
the vagina.

01:39.400 --> 01:44.440
I'm going to North Carolina with my beef dick and I'm making a canyon, I fucked your

01:44.440 --> 01:51.400
momma and she said, damn son, fuck me more, so I did it, let's have some s'mores, chocolate,

01:51.400 --> 01:59.360
graham crackers, little mellow, fucked your momma, she's yellow, I mean cowardly, I mean

01:59.360 --> 02:00.360
cowardly.

02:00.360 --> 02:07.560
All right, thank you, the whole avenue of trouble I haven't gotten into yet.

02:07.560 --> 02:13.400
You're going to have to apologize for that rap.

02:13.400 --> 02:18.600
Thank you for joining us again in our no audience podcast.

02:18.600 --> 02:27.040
There's some good signs on that front, I think Nolan's been making some progress and there

02:27.040 --> 02:33.400
was some shifting in the power halls in the city of Burbank.

02:33.400 --> 02:39.040
I think there's a new guy who was in charge of Burbank now and he came through and he

02:39.040 --> 02:45.760
was pretty friendly into the venue and he suggested, if you guys separate these desires

02:45.760 --> 02:50.680
of serving liquor here and doing a show here, you know, you could probably get an audience

02:50.680 --> 02:56.680
back in here a lot faster and you can still work on the license for the serving.

02:56.680 --> 03:01.680
So I think if we do that, we could be looking at an audience version of the podcast again

03:01.680 --> 03:02.680
soon.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.480
How soon?

03:04.480 --> 03:05.480
Not soon.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.800
What a popular thing, probably not soon.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.240
Not very soon, I mean sooner, certainly.

03:11.240 --> 03:15.160
Not so soon that if that's what you're waiting for, you should prepare.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.160
You should prepare.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.160
Yeah.

03:17.160 --> 03:20.080
Or hang your hopes on it at all.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.080
You should probably.

03:21.080 --> 03:25.480
How do you feel about doing it with or without the audience?

03:25.480 --> 03:27.360
What's the difference for you over the last one?

03:27.360 --> 03:29.960
I think we all prefer it without an audience, right?

03:29.960 --> 03:33.040
It's been so much easier and better.

03:33.040 --> 03:38.520
I think we've eaten our share of this, the lonely sandwich, I don't know.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.680
It's six at one, whatever.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.440
We haven't done it with an audience in a million years, so I'm looking forward to it.

03:44.440 --> 03:49.160
Speaking of which, we're going to be at SketchFest in San Francisco in front of an audience.

03:49.160 --> 03:52.400
We're not going to bring our lack of audience with us.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.440
That's too expensive to fly, that much lack of audience.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.000
We can't fly a lack of audience, I don't know.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.960
So we're going to go to an audience in San Francisco and do a little show there.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.280
I guess Google it, I don't know.

04:05.280 --> 04:10.920
Yeah, Google SF SketchFest, Harmontown 2018 or something along those lines.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.120
Yeah.

04:12.120 --> 04:17.600
I wanted to do our Belmont joke, but you don't even remember the radio.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.600
Oh, it was a Belmont joke.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.600
Yeah, yeah.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.600
You said camera, I didn't understand what you were talking about.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.600
That's all right.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.600
That was part of the joke.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.760
You have it written down, right?

04:25.760 --> 04:27.600
I have the bullet points.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.000
Okay, so why don't you set this up, or should I set it up?

04:32.000 --> 04:38.680
Okay, so we have this friend, she's a director, Sofia, Shmuka Muka Muka, it's a Swedish name.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.600
It's not Shmuka Muka Muka, but yeah.

04:41.600 --> 04:46.400
I should have her last name because she, a long time ago I tweeted a music video that

04:46.400 --> 04:48.480
she did right over here in this space.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.640
She does stop motion stuff.

04:50.640 --> 04:56.480
She's done a couple music videos at Star Burns now, very, very talented director.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.960
She's from Sweden, she's here on some kind of visa or whatever.

04:59.960 --> 05:05.120
And maybe if you're a fan of Cody's Instagram, you've seen her teaching Cody how to say various

05:05.120 --> 05:08.080
filthy things in Swedish.

05:08.080 --> 05:13.640
What I do have, Dan, is the Wikipedia, like, Belman joke.

05:13.640 --> 05:17.800
Right, so we were talking about jokes, like, somehow it came up, she said there's this

05:17.800 --> 05:20.920
tradition in Sweden that's called the Belman joke.

05:20.920 --> 05:21.920
So is that where-

05:21.920 --> 05:28.920
Belman is like kind of the all-purpose character in a, like he's the butt of the joke, but he's

05:28.920 --> 05:34.560
also kind of the hero of the joke in his own naivete stupidity.

05:34.560 --> 05:38.520
We find ourselves culturally fascinated with it because we're Americans, so we have pollock

05:38.520 --> 05:42.400
jokes, we have blonde jokes, we have all kinds of horrible jokes I can't even mention by

05:42.400 --> 05:48.720
category, but, like, we don't have, like, American jokes where we're cast as either

05:48.720 --> 05:54.160
the wise guy in a ship of fools or the, there's some jokes where it's like you're trying to

05:54.160 --> 06:00.960
pump yourself up like a redneck and a Yankee go into a place and the redneck just does

06:00.960 --> 06:03.720
this and he's a simple working man and you're, like, yay.

06:03.720 --> 06:09.120
The first paragraph in the Wikipedia for Belman joke is, the Belman joke is a type of simple

06:09.120 --> 06:16.040
joke popular among Swedish school children, always including a person named Belman as

06:16.040 --> 06:17.280
the main character.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.080
And very often, do they have an example in there?

06:20.080 --> 06:24.160
Yeah, very often it's like, you know how in America when you're a kid you learn these

06:24.160 --> 06:29.880
jokes are like a black guy, a Chinese guy, and a Polish guy go into a popcorn store or

06:29.880 --> 06:35.200
whatever and the Polish guy ends up doing something stupid or maybe it's the black guy

06:35.200 --> 06:38.560
that does something that's more pragmatic or...

06:38.560 --> 06:47.080
But in this case, there's two cultures and Belman who is a person and he stands apart.

06:47.080 --> 06:50.880
He's either the villain or the hero, depending on your point of view.

06:50.880 --> 06:55.720
He's kind of the, yeah, it's like, I think it's like a manifestation of Sweden as they're

06:55.720 --> 07:00.720
like, well, what are we going to do, we probably don't have that big of an army, you know, like

07:00.720 --> 07:02.600
I don't, it's a national psyche thing.

07:02.600 --> 07:06.880
It's like they'll go, oh, there's this guy, there's that guy, and then there's Belman.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.400
Belman is the Swedish guy.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.600
He's just a regular Joe.

07:09.600 --> 07:19.120
So Dan, a Dane, a Norwegian, and Belman made a wager on who could remain inside a goat

07:19.120 --> 07:20.120
pen the longest.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.120
Right.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.120
Okay, classic Belman.

07:22.120 --> 07:28.200
This is just, this is your run of the mill Belman joke.

07:28.200 --> 07:35.600
First out was the Dane who came out just after 10 minutes yelling, damn, that goat stinks.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.440
After him, the Norwegian went in.

07:37.440 --> 07:42.440
After half an hour, he came out yelling, damn, that goat stinks.

07:42.440 --> 07:46.660
Finally, Belman went in.

07:46.660 --> 07:53.320
After two hours, the goat came rushing out saying, damn, that Belman stinks.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.320
Can I rewrite that real quick?

07:54.320 --> 08:00.000
After 10 minutes, whatever it is, just say, they should just say the goat came out.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.560
He doesn't have to say, damn, that Belman stinks.

08:02.560 --> 08:12.600
Okay, well, Dan, maybe you haven't heard this one, a Russian, a German and Belman wanted

08:12.600 --> 08:17.680
to see who could swim the fastest across the Atlantic Ocean.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.440
First out was the German, you know, of course.

08:20.440 --> 08:24.080
He swam one kilometer and drowned.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.640
Next came the Russian.

08:25.640 --> 08:29.320
He swam 10 kilometers, he drowned.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.200
Now it was Belman's turn.

08:31.200 --> 08:37.880
He swam and swam until he almost reached America, then he got tired and swam back.

08:37.880 --> 08:38.880
Let's see.

08:38.880 --> 08:39.880
Now that's a hero.

08:39.880 --> 08:40.880
Yeah, right.

08:40.880 --> 08:45.960
Sometimes Belman, it's like a weird fusion of like in America where someone has to be

08:45.960 --> 08:51.080
being shit on or whatever, but it's interesting to me that it's like, so we were like, oh,

08:51.080 --> 08:53.920
what an interesting joke format, what an interesting thing.

08:53.920 --> 08:59.520
Yeah, because it's not a pollock joke, it's not an n-bomb joke, it's not a racist joke.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.400
It's also not like a jingoistic, like fucking Swedes do it, the best joke.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.280
I got two questions.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.000
Is Belman a first or a last name?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.200
I think, I would say first, I guess.

09:09.200 --> 09:13.560
Is it supposed to be a reference to their race or like ethnic, like is it supposed to

09:13.560 --> 09:14.560
be that's us?

09:14.560 --> 09:15.560
I think it's probably.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.640
Because they put it in context with other people from countries, so it's like.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.640
Yeah, I think that's the joke.

09:19.640 --> 09:24.560
Spencer, as far as Wikipedia is concerned, the jokes first became popular in the 19th

09:24.560 --> 09:30.560
century and originally inspired the life of the poet and composer Carl Michael Belman.

09:30.560 --> 09:36.760
The first known Belman joke survived in a book from 1835, so it goes back that far.

09:36.760 --> 09:40.640
So that's almost like just like having Mr. Bean be a character in a joke.

09:40.640 --> 09:44.520
Yeah, that's how we interpreted it, is that it's sort of like Fred Flintstone or like,

09:44.520 --> 09:48.720
even if his name was Kowalski or something.

09:48.720 --> 09:54.160
We don't have a national identity like that, like we don't have like a Joe Blow or something.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.600
He's so outside of having an identity though in these jokes because he's the third person

09:58.600 --> 10:02.760
to be set up and he's the only one whose race isn't called that.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.840
He's not a race, he's kind of a disembodied character.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.040
He's a neutral country.

10:07.040 --> 10:12.040
Wait, that's Switzerland.

10:12.040 --> 10:18.280
But isn't it sort of like there, you know, you're Swedish and you, I think that's part

10:18.280 --> 10:19.280
of it though.

10:19.280 --> 10:25.200
As you'll see in the Belman joke that we wrote, thank you, we took a half hour and we wrote

10:25.200 --> 10:26.200
a Belman joke.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.920
Let's be honest, it took us nearly an hour, 45 minutes.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.560
Okay, I'm going to see if I can come up with a Belman joke.

10:31.560 --> 10:37.080
Spencer, can you riff a Belman, do you already think that you have a handle on that premise

10:37.080 --> 10:38.080
so well that you can do it?

10:38.080 --> 10:40.240
No, I'll need a half hour to nearly an hour, I think.

10:40.240 --> 10:44.000
Okay, well it should take me about that time to tell ours because I'm not that good at

10:44.000 --> 10:48.920
telling jokes, but I wrote down the bullet points, Jeff and I took like an hour.

10:48.920 --> 10:54.040
We wanted to see, could we make our friend Sophia the Swede laugh with a Belman joke?

10:54.040 --> 10:56.640
Laugh with a proper Swedish Belman joke.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.240
So here's what we did.

10:59.240 --> 11:02.920
We took it or leave it, but I think we fucking nailed it.

11:02.920 --> 11:03.920
We fucking did it.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.760
I'm really proud of it and she laughed.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.760
She laughed.

11:07.760 --> 11:08.760
There's some sort of reaction.

11:08.760 --> 11:09.760
We told it.

11:09.760 --> 11:13.800
We got to the punchline and she went, is that like she kind of like she went over it like

11:13.800 --> 11:14.800
a pothole.

11:14.800 --> 11:20.640
She couldn't believe that we updated and contemporized fucking Belman jokes.

11:20.640 --> 11:25.620
Okay, so you know my history with telling jokes, but this is so this is like an evil

11:25.620 --> 11:29.480
cannibal fuck feet here, this is where we might run into trouble.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.480
You have it written down.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.480
I do.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.480
I have my bullet points.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.480
Okay.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.480
Bullet points.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.480
You don't have it written down.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.480
I haven't bullet points.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.480
Okay.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.680
A good joke is somewhat rift.

11:39.680 --> 11:45.720
Well, I, is that, is that, all right, guys, you know, come on, give me a, I feel like a

11:45.720 --> 11:50.600
real Belman right now or I'm going to prove myself to be a Belman because I'm going to

11:50.600 --> 11:51.600
come through in the end.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.040
I'm going to, in a weird way.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
All right.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.040
Just look, here's our Belman joke.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.040
Here it is.

11:56.040 --> 12:02.760
Jeff, Jeff and I wrote this at the drawing room, took us 45, 45 minutes.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.400
It's the year 2019 AD.

12:06.400 --> 12:10.400
Earth has made first contact with an alien species.

12:10.400 --> 12:17.840
The message from this mysterious alien species is we are here to destroy you.

12:17.840 --> 12:23.600
If you are not worthy, send three emissaries from your species.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.720
Each can bring one item.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.160
A lottery is held.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.480
The emissaries are chosen.

12:32.480 --> 12:42.360
A Dutch astronaut, a German astronaut and Belman.

12:42.360 --> 12:49.600
The astronauts are placed into the prescribed craft.

12:49.600 --> 12:55.320
It is sent up to the mothership orbiting the earth.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.920
The airlock opens.

12:57.920 --> 13:09.400
The omnipotent ominous aliens send their emissary into the vestibule of the ship.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.000
Our astronauts enter with their items.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.080
What have you brought?

13:15.080 --> 13:17.040
Says the alien.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.160
The Dutch astronaut steps forward.

13:19.160 --> 13:23.400
I have brought this model of a windmill.

13:23.400 --> 13:29.320
The Dutch were the first to harness the natural resources of the earth, and although our species

13:29.320 --> 13:37.160
currently lives in conflict with our planet, this is evidence that our people have it in

13:37.160 --> 13:44.680
them as early as the dawn of civilization to live in harmony with Mother Gaia.

13:44.680 --> 13:49.320
What have you brought?

13:49.320 --> 13:54.600
The German astronaut pulls out a pistol.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.600
This is a German Luger pistol.

13:57.600 --> 14:02.800
It is the peak of German engineering.

14:02.800 --> 14:09.720
Yes, it is war-based, but your species did say you were here to destroy us if we didn't

14:09.720 --> 14:11.640
prove ourselves.

14:11.640 --> 14:18.080
This is evidence that we have it in us to follow perfect order and have perfect hierarchy,

14:18.080 --> 14:24.560
and that the results can be this, this perfect piece of engineering that has literally never

14:24.560 --> 14:30.840
misfired a shot, the German Luger.

14:30.840 --> 14:39.520
And what have you, Belman, pulls out a camera, says, I brought a Hasselblad camera.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.640
It's a Swedish camera.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.840
It's state-of-the-art.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.200
Why?

14:46.200 --> 14:48.520
Because nobody's going to believe this shit.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.520
Yeah.

14:49.520 --> 14:54.520
That's a good Belman joke.

14:54.520 --> 15:00.280
Ladies and gentlemen, Belman, that's a good Belman joke.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.520
And then I think the rest of it, as you can imagine, I think the aliens like, I like this

15:03.520 --> 15:07.520
guy, planet Belman.

15:07.520 --> 15:11.520
Or do they, do they kill, who do they, do they have to stick?

15:11.520 --> 15:12.520
I don't know.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.000
My favorite part of the joke is the Dana Ma.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.040
What happens after the Polish guy eats all of the pea-soaked popcorn instead of having

15:20.040 --> 15:21.040
sex with the farmer's daughter?

15:21.040 --> 15:25.640
I mean, certainly a stomach ache.

15:25.640 --> 15:26.640
Yeah.

15:26.640 --> 15:32.960
But like, let's say you put yourself in the pants, if aliens wear pants, which one do

15:32.960 --> 15:33.960
you pick?

15:33.960 --> 15:37.480
Do you pick the, the aliens that we're here to, the aliens that we're here to pick?

15:37.480 --> 15:40.160
The peaceful engineering of the Dutch?

15:40.160 --> 15:42.080
The warlike engineering of the Germans?

15:42.080 --> 15:46.280
Or the ironic, I get the joke, Belman?

15:46.280 --> 15:47.280
They weren't here to pick.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.680
They wanted to see if we had, if our civilization had generated a Belman.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.920
You know, I think when you're, when you're playing, when your species gets to the point

15:54.920 --> 16:00.200
where it's capable of Belman production, you're like, okay, you're, you're all right.

16:00.200 --> 16:04.720
And probably another alien comes out and goes, I'm the alien equivalent of Belman.

16:04.720 --> 16:09.920
Like long ago, people didn't understand a goofy horse sense.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.360
Spencer, do you think you're ready for your Belman joke or do you need some time?

16:13.360 --> 16:18.280
I just want to say that I think that you really did what a scripted joke could not have accomplished

16:18.280 --> 16:21.120
by going off book and using those, that outline.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.240
So thank you.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.840
I was, you elevated the material.

16:24.840 --> 16:25.840
Yeah.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.680
And I, and I don't think you're being sarcastic.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.360
I'm not, but I could be.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.360
Yeah.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.080
But I choose to believe that you're not.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.320
Well, yeah, I think the tension there is maybe.

16:35.320 --> 16:40.920
Spencer, your black outfit is blending into the background and you look like a disembodied

16:40.920 --> 16:41.920
ghost person.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.360
That's all I've always wished I would be.

16:43.360 --> 16:48.480
Did I tell you guys that I imagined my head like running around like, like it like hops

16:48.480 --> 16:55.240
off my body and like runs around on little beard feet, you know, like, did you have,

16:55.240 --> 16:57.000
did you have a Belman joke?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.080
I came up with one.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.760
I'm not proud of it, but you know, that was the task.

17:00.760 --> 17:04.120
If you come up with one that quickly, you don't have to be proud of it.

17:04.120 --> 17:07.000
You can be proud that you came up with a Belman joke that quickly.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Okay.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Like later.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Well, then I am.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
All right.

17:11.000 --> 17:18.680
So in Elf, a dwarf and Belmont are outside of a dungeon, as I say, I became hysterical.

17:18.680 --> 17:19.880
You're outside of what?

17:19.880 --> 17:20.880
A dungeon.

17:20.880 --> 17:21.880
Okay.

17:21.880 --> 17:25.960
And the elf goes like, I'm going to get that treasure and goes in there and five minutes

17:25.960 --> 17:26.960
later comes back out.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.520
And he's like, Jesus Christ, there's no trees.

17:28.520 --> 17:29.520
It's claustrophobic in there.

17:29.520 --> 17:30.520
I can't hack it.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.280
And the dwarf's like, ha, ha, fucking elves.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.760
And then the dwarf goes in there and then he comes out.

17:35.760 --> 17:39.200
He's all scratched up and bloody and he's like, this place is full of orcs, man.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.360
I'm not going back.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.920
There's no way the treasure's worth that.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.640
And then Belmont's like, I got this, you guys.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.720
And then he comes back like two hours later and he's just fine.

17:47.720 --> 17:50.320
And everyone's like, what, what, what happened?

17:50.320 --> 17:52.040
He's like, you guys were totally right, man.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.880
There was like, the place was terrible.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.400
There was like just a bunch of dusty coins and stuff.

17:57.400 --> 18:01.080
You see, because he got the treasure, but he didn't care for it.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.080
Right.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.080
Oh, he didn't care.

18:03.080 --> 18:07.040
He didn't like the treasure because the Belmont has a different standard.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.040
Right.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.040
Yeah.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.040
That's fucking great.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.520
No, it's not great.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.600
It certainly passes the test of being a Belmont joke on some level.

18:15.600 --> 18:16.880
I think it's not great.

18:16.880 --> 18:22.280
One tweak would be, I think if you, if each of them were specified as coming out empty-handed.

18:22.280 --> 18:26.000
So that when Belmont comes out empty-handed and then he's like, yeah.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
All right.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.800
Well, I stuck to the script and that was my flow.

18:33.800 --> 18:37.000
Our next guest needs no introduction.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.920
He's been touring clubs and colleges all across the nation.

18:40.920 --> 18:45.000
You might have missed him on Jimmy Kimmel.

18:45.000 --> 18:51.920
He's been a good friend of mine for a long time and a good friend of the show and a good

18:51.920 --> 18:54.320
friend of entertainment in general.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.320
Please welcome Rob Schrab.

18:57.320 --> 19:02.320
Oh, no.

19:02.320 --> 19:22.320
All right, Rob, do you want to try to freestyle a Belmont joke?

19:22.320 --> 19:28.480
It's a tripartite joke where one person is either the hero or the dummy.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.680
Hard to tell which.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.560
It's kind of like the Schrabbing of jokes.

19:32.560 --> 19:39.320
I'm so, have you guys been having a hard time with 2018?

19:39.320 --> 19:40.320
Yeah.

19:40.320 --> 19:45.320
That's gone pretty seamlessly for me so far.

19:45.320 --> 19:49.320
I mean, I haven't, I've been having a.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.320
10, 10, shush, shush.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.320
I haven't.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.320
It's my mic on.

19:54.320 --> 20:00.520
I've just, I haven't been a hard time getting up in the morning.

20:00.520 --> 20:01.520
Like it was difficult.

20:01.520 --> 20:05.680
It was difficult for me to come over here.

20:05.680 --> 20:11.320
I have not really, I got a lot of work I could be doing and it's not even that much.

20:11.320 --> 20:16.320
It's not even an overwhelming workload, but I still, I've, I really am still in vacation

20:16.320 --> 20:17.320
mode.

20:17.320 --> 20:21.160
I, yeah, I'm having like a hard turn.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.320
I'm having a hard turn.

20:22.320 --> 20:31.080
I'm going through, I don't, I go to bed early, I sleep late, I'm, I don't go out, I'm home,

20:31.080 --> 20:33.320
I order in a lot.

20:33.320 --> 20:42.120
Does Kate, Kate goes, goes, plays magic cards and VR and hangs out in Malibu and it's just

20:42.120 --> 20:43.120
me and the dog.

20:43.120 --> 20:48.720
Cody and I are definitely enabling each other, like we just, every weekend, we just, we can't

20:48.720 --> 20:52.680
wait to get to the weekend and then we jump into bed and we just turn into fucking potatoes

20:52.680 --> 20:53.680
and just, we just don't.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.680
I've been doing that a lot.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.680
But you're doing it regardless.

20:56.680 --> 21:01.120
You know, Kate's going like, okay, I'm going to Malibu to play magic ballering and you're

21:01.120 --> 21:02.120
like.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.760
I've been also meditating.

21:03.760 --> 21:09.640
I've been meditating a lot, like, which is, I'm taking a nap for how long?

21:09.640 --> 21:17.360
Like, I'll, like, I'll set my insight timer for 20 minutes, but I'll, I'll set the alarm.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.200
If you meditate too long, you could go crazy, you know, have you read about that?

21:21.200 --> 21:22.200
No.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.040
I mean, it has to be in the neighborhood of like 48 hours.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.040
Don't worry about it.

21:26.040 --> 21:33.840
A Buddhist, a Hindu and a Belman go to Nirvana start meditating and they try to achieve Nirvana

21:33.840 --> 21:37.400
together and the Hindu says, I'll go into Nirvana first.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.960
I've been taking transit meditation classes.

21:41.960 --> 21:42.960
You've been taking what?

21:42.960 --> 21:43.960
Sorry.

21:43.960 --> 21:44.960
Transcendental meditation classes.

21:44.960 --> 21:45.960
Oh, okay.

21:45.960 --> 21:46.960
Yeah.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.360
I went to one of those orientations for that.

21:48.360 --> 21:49.360
Oh yeah.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.360
It's like right around the block.

21:50.360 --> 21:51.360
Yeah.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.360
Jonah Ray was there.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.360
Oh, really?

21:53.360 --> 21:55.760
I'm sure he doesn't mind me saying that.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.960
He was put up to it by Joel Hodgson, our good friend.

21:57.960 --> 21:58.960
Yeah.

21:58.960 --> 21:59.960
Same here.

21:59.960 --> 22:00.960
It was really into TM.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.960
Yeah.

22:01.960 --> 22:02.960
You know what?

22:02.960 --> 22:03.960
It's the fucking best.

22:03.960 --> 22:09.680
It's like three years ago, he goes, I think you really need to be doing this, man.

22:09.680 --> 22:16.200
I think with your, like the way your mind works, you got to get up inside that mother

22:16.200 --> 22:17.200
grabber.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.200
Yeah.

22:18.200 --> 22:22.480
You guys got to really like down into it.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.480
Now.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.480
Now.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.480
So I didn't.

22:25.480 --> 22:26.480
I really, I enjoyed it.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.480
Yeah.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.480
I've been.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.480
Did you grab that mother?

22:29.480 --> 22:30.480
I grabbed a mother.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.160
I can't remember why Cody and I didn't go back.

22:33.160 --> 22:39.400
It wasn't like, I think it was just like, I think it, oh, you know what?

22:39.400 --> 22:42.720
It was because they said you can't get high.

22:42.720 --> 22:43.920
Cody was like peace.

22:43.920 --> 22:48.400
Like in general or before the class, like you have to, like you're not supposed to get

22:48.400 --> 22:49.400
high.

22:49.400 --> 22:54.680
They said, you know, to get like an actual, you know, as you start out, it wasn't like

22:54.680 --> 23:00.320
for the rest of your life, it was like, if you're going to do this, you're going to,

23:00.320 --> 23:08.760
you know, to get a proper version of what hopefully will help you try not to drink or

23:08.760 --> 23:10.760
get high or whatever.

23:10.760 --> 23:14.880
Or they even said, don't take a nap before, you know, just little things like that.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.880
Yeah.

23:15.880 --> 23:16.880
No, I know it was temporary.

23:16.880 --> 23:17.880
It wasn't like that.

23:17.880 --> 23:18.880
But still, deal breaker.

23:18.880 --> 23:19.880
Yeah.

23:19.880 --> 23:24.000
Like we're not having kids because I think, you know, like Cody was like, well, maybe

23:24.000 --> 23:25.200
we should freeze our eggs.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.200
That's extreme.

23:26.200 --> 23:30.480
And then you go, okay, step one to freeze your eggs, don't get high for the done.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.480
Forget it.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.480
Peace.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.520
You, you two really like getting high.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.520
I really like Cody.

23:36.520 --> 23:37.800
She really, really likes getting high.

23:37.800 --> 23:41.680
I should get high more than drink less.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.600
I get high and then I go to bed.

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
Yeah.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.600
Me too.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.360
I eat and then I go to bed.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.120
I turn on the television and I go to bed.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.120
Yeah, man.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.120
I'm falling apart.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.120
No, man.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.440
This is a cry for help.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.440
You're just sleeping.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.040
What are you supposed to, what do you want to do?

23:59.040 --> 24:02.960
You want to be a CG head in the bucket list, like falling out of a plane?

24:02.960 --> 24:07.280
Like, like what, don't, don't let people trick you into thinking that life is about going

24:07.280 --> 24:09.920
outside or, or flying a kite.

24:09.920 --> 24:10.920
Like what the fuck?

24:10.920 --> 24:11.920
Who cares?

24:11.920 --> 24:12.920
Those people are morons.

24:12.920 --> 24:13.920
I'm not happy though.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.920
Oh, okay.

24:14.920 --> 24:15.920
Well, let's see.

24:15.920 --> 24:16.920
That's, that's it.

24:16.920 --> 24:21.240
But, but, but in case you're not happy because you think you should be doing something else,

24:21.240 --> 24:23.240
that could be, that could be part of the whole syndrome.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.240
That's a little bit of it too.

24:24.240 --> 24:28.160
I think if you step on the gas and go, I want to be in bed, you know, that's how I quit

24:28.160 --> 24:29.160
smoking.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.160
It was like, I'm going to fucking smoke this cigarette.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.760
I'm going to smoke the shit out of this fucking cigarette.

24:32.760 --> 24:38.240
Like I'm sick and tired of pretending I'm trying to quit or resenting people for telling

24:38.240 --> 24:39.240
me I should quit.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.240
It's like, I'm smoking.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.240
Okay.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.520
I'm going to smoke this cigarette and I'd look at each cigarette and I'd go like, get

24:43.520 --> 24:45.560
ready to get smoked, you little fuck.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
And I'd smoke it.

24:46.560 --> 24:51.000
And I'd be like, and then I, that, that was the first step down the road to getting to

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
quit smoking.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Right.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Like being intentional.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Right.

24:55.000 --> 25:00.720
It's like, like instead of pretending and being unconscious about things, you know, not wanting

25:00.720 --> 25:06.480
to face things is a big, that seals off a mental process that could just make thoughts

25:06.480 --> 25:10.240
like magnify and, and, but simultaneously they're sealed off.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.680
So you're not even knowing they're magnified.

25:12.680 --> 25:18.280
That's where you get your classic guy, you know, sipping coffee and, and, and then the,

25:18.280 --> 25:23.280
they run out of Splenda and he takes a knife out and kills everybody because the classic.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.280
Yeah.

25:24.280 --> 25:25.280
You know, it's just that thing.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.280
That's like,

25:26.280 --> 25:27.280
What are you unhappy about?

25:27.280 --> 25:28.280
Rob?

25:28.280 --> 25:31.200
I just unfulfilled, you know, professionally probably, right?

25:31.200 --> 25:33.200
Not creatively or both.

25:33.200 --> 25:38.240
Because usually there's creative and professional and they're kind of not necessarily the same.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.840
I just, it's not fun anymore.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.840
Right.

25:41.840 --> 25:42.840
Yeah.

25:42.840 --> 25:49.040
And I, I miss that and, you know, and everybody wants to help and say, well, you got to go

25:49.040 --> 25:50.040
out.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.040
You got to read.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.040
You got to do some stuff.

25:52.040 --> 25:56.560
It's just like, yeah, I know, but that doesn't, it doesn't help.

25:56.560 --> 25:57.560
I don't want to help.

25:57.560 --> 26:01.680
I want, I want you to, I want you to fucking pop like a, because I know it'll be great.

26:01.680 --> 26:05.680
You know, it's like, I want you to get so fucking sad and angry and, and sick of the

26:05.680 --> 26:11.160
world and selfish and that you take all of that talent that you can't escape and just

26:11.160 --> 26:16.440
fucking smash it like Eddie Van Halen guitar and like create some crazy new form of music

26:16.440 --> 26:18.120
that, you know, no pressure.

26:18.120 --> 26:23.120
I, I, I just, you know, I, I, I just like, I like making little animations and put them

26:23.120 --> 26:24.120
on Instagram or whatever.

26:24.120 --> 26:29.680
Like you're, I think you need to do what Justin did when he, when he, you know, when he started

26:29.680 --> 26:34.440
doing the voices that became Rick and Morty, it was because he was like, he was mad and

26:34.440 --> 26:35.600
lonely and sad.

26:35.600 --> 26:40.320
Like he hated like working and like he, he, and he just wanted to take a shit on back

26:40.320 --> 26:41.320
to the future.

26:41.320 --> 26:46.440
So he just, he's just, he's just alienated, you know, it's like, just follow it.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.320
Like think about how fucking much you hate everybody.

26:49.320 --> 26:50.320
Like they're stupid.

26:50.320 --> 26:51.320
They control your life.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.320
I don't want to hate anybody.

26:53.320 --> 26:58.520
I just, I just, it's, it's just getting, it's like, you, or how much you hate yourself

26:58.520 --> 26:59.520
them.

26:59.520 --> 27:00.520
Well, okay.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.520
All right.

27:01.520 --> 27:07.440
Well, it's, it's, it's like waking up and going, this again, yeah, this, this, this,

27:07.440 --> 27:08.440
I got it.

27:08.440 --> 27:13.840
I got, I got 12 hours of this before it's okay for me to go back to sleep, go back to

27:13.840 --> 27:14.840
bed.

27:14.840 --> 27:15.840
We'll capture that.

27:15.840 --> 27:20.920
I'm already, I'm already captivated by your, your expressing it.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.280
You're always going to be an artist.

27:22.280 --> 27:28.360
Like I, I, I guy, you know, you know how a guy at Dunkin Donuts says what you just said.

27:28.360 --> 27:31.600
He says something that he heard on a television.

27:31.600 --> 27:36.080
He says same shit different day and he, and then he, and then he rapes somebody.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.240
I don't want to rape anyone.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.520
What would be the, the, like the dream.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.520
I don't know.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.520
That's the thing.

27:42.520 --> 27:46.840
If you woke up and said, oh, I'm creating, I'm working, I'm doing this thing, what would

27:46.840 --> 27:47.840
that be?

27:47.840 --> 27:48.840
I don't know.

27:48.840 --> 27:49.840
I don't know what that would be.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.680
I mean, I literally can do whatever I want right now.

27:52.680 --> 27:56.640
I mean, I, I'm sitting on a ton of savings.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.800
I, I don't have many expenses.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.720
I could jump on a plane and go anywhere I want.

28:01.720 --> 28:04.040
I could invest all my money into something.

28:04.040 --> 28:07.000
And I just, I'm like, I don't know.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.440
It's just this severe, sad apathy.

28:10.440 --> 28:14.000
I feel the exact same way, except without as much money.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.840
I mean, certainly I'm more comfortable than I have.

28:15.840 --> 28:19.400
You could get on like a twin prop and go a couple places in California.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.640
Let's go like fly.

28:20.640 --> 28:28.240
I vote for going like, like, like following your assessment of the monotony though.

28:28.240 --> 28:33.200
I think that that's how caterpillars start to spin a cocoon, that you feel sluggish.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.200
You're full of leaves.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.820
You don't want to eat them anymore.

28:35.820 --> 28:37.720
You have all the energy you need.

28:37.720 --> 28:42.640
It's just all like your metabolism is down and a transformation is about to happen.

28:42.640 --> 28:46.600
And the caterpillar, we don't want our, if we like our butterflies, we don't want our

28:46.600 --> 28:51.160
caterpillars like forcing themselves to go to yoga when they feel that way.

28:51.160 --> 28:59.120
We want them to like do like double down on that feeling because locked somewhere in there

28:59.120 --> 29:02.520
is the beginning of a new phase.

29:02.520 --> 29:11.200
You're, you're, you're lucky to have a logical stopping point emotionally where things just

29:11.200 --> 29:15.360
feel like, okay, I think that can be incredibly depressing.

29:15.360 --> 29:19.520
You know, when you finish a draft, you finish a job, like there's that postpartum depression

29:19.520 --> 29:24.400
because, but it's like, it's because you're done with one thing and you haven't started

29:24.400 --> 29:26.320
another yet and you feel useless.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.000
And I know that's not what you're feeling right now.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.680
You feel like it's in a larger scale, but I'm saying that's because you're, you're the

29:32.680 --> 29:37.400
project that you've finished isn't as simple as, oh, I just did this thing with JJ Abrams

29:37.400 --> 29:40.120
and now I got to look for another job.

29:40.120 --> 29:45.000
It's a chapter of your life that is ending and that, and that it could be a regression

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
to childhood.

29:46.000 --> 29:54.240
Like you may need to get your, your little cardboard things back out and fucking and,

29:54.240 --> 29:59.760
and I would say, instead of forcing yourself, I'm gonna, I'm gonna make like a new franchise.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.360
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do this amazing thing.

30:02.360 --> 30:08.440
Like I like this, I like this thought of you turning your gaze on the clockwork of life

30:08.440 --> 30:11.480
where you're like looking at how pointless it all is.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.440
You're going like, this is what life is.

30:13.440 --> 30:19.400
This is like, I'm like killing time between naps and I can't get out of bed and like time

30:19.400 --> 30:22.320
means nothing and life means nothing and all this stuff.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.440
I'd love to see your blue period, you know?

30:25.440 --> 30:26.440
Yeah.

30:26.440 --> 30:33.320
Now, I mean, I, I've been thinking about that like a lot, like in the last year, just like,

30:33.320 --> 30:34.840
what do I really want to be doing?

30:34.840 --> 30:41.920
You know, you've had, I've had this trajectory of doing a certain, living a certain life,

30:41.920 --> 30:45.680
you know, since I was like eight years old, you know, and I'm living it, you know, I've

30:45.680 --> 30:52.680
done pretty much everything I've ever set out to do, at least tasted it, and now I'm

30:52.680 --> 30:55.680
like, well, wasn't that great?

30:55.680 --> 30:59.280
Well, it's great, it's fine, but where's the surprise?

30:59.280 --> 31:04.680
Where's the, where's the person that said, oh, I'm instead, I, I, one day, you know,

31:04.680 --> 31:08.880
I mean, like the, the, the, you hear the story of somebody doing the opposite of what we're

31:08.880 --> 31:14.080
doing, you know, the lawyer that said, I, I want to write, uh, the, the diehard three,

31:14.080 --> 31:17.760
you know, like, and goes out and does it, you know, and leaves that world behind and

31:17.760 --> 31:23.680
becomes a creative, like, what's the opposite of the creative person who has done nothing

31:23.680 --> 31:26.880
but being creative this entire life, even for fun.

31:26.880 --> 31:32.920
Do you think as a version of you, Rob, that even if you wrote the perfect thing, got all

31:32.920 --> 31:35.480
the kudos for it that would make you happy?

31:35.480 --> 31:41.440
Like, well, I've already done that and, and, and it's, and it's, it's, it makes you happy,

31:41.440 --> 31:45.120
but being happy and being satisfied are not necessarily the same thing.

31:45.120 --> 31:49.080
Well, that's a satisfied, like, like, what, like, is there a version where you go, oh,

31:49.080 --> 31:54.360
I did, I crossed a finish line that made me feel satisfied.

31:54.360 --> 31:59.160
Like, is, is there a work thing, a drawing that you could do, a movie you could write,

31:59.160 --> 32:05.920
a award you could win that you would cross that threshold and go, oh, I feel good.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.320
Uh, I, I miss being proud.

32:08.320 --> 32:11.040
Well, then what would make you?

32:11.040 --> 32:12.040
Well, I don't know.

32:12.040 --> 32:16.000
I mean, you know, like, I just, you know, there's some things that you go out and, you

32:16.000 --> 32:20.560
know, you do something and you're, you're like, I did that because it's a job or I,

32:20.560 --> 32:25.560
you know, I do this and it, it went so far and it was great for that.

32:25.560 --> 32:31.280
But then it just didn't go over that, that, that next step to get to out into the public

32:31.280 --> 32:32.280
or whatever.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.760
But I feel the same too.

32:33.760 --> 32:40.280
It's just like, I, you know, there's fake thresholds I thought that I would have crossed

32:40.280 --> 32:46.960
by now, but I'm just happy now to make a living, like doing, like, what I like.

32:46.960 --> 32:52.480
And that's, I'm in the very lucky percentage of people that get to do that.

32:52.480 --> 33:01.280
But you're more artistic than I am, like you're, like, your book, like, but I, but I can't

33:01.280 --> 33:02.280
do anything else.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.800
It was like, you draw it and you don't even like it.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.560
You draw because you have to, because what else are you going to fucking do?

33:09.560 --> 33:10.560
Yeah.

33:10.560 --> 33:11.560
Yeah.

33:11.560 --> 33:14.760
Well, that's how I think, I mean, there's, there's those two levels of, it's like, you

33:14.760 --> 33:19.320
and I have been on both tracks at various stages of, of our careers.

33:19.320 --> 33:25.840
There's the track where there's all this artificial outside encouragement where people are calling

33:25.840 --> 33:32.720
and going, like, how'd you like to meet with Gwyneth Johnsonberg?

33:32.720 --> 33:34.160
And you're like, Gwyneth, okay.

33:34.160 --> 33:40.080
And then she's like, I want, I've always wanted, I've always been into slinkies and, and, and

33:40.080 --> 33:44.520
slinkies interested in, and, and then you, you, you get to get out of bed every day and

33:44.520 --> 33:48.560
go like, well, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to fucking blow people's mind by making

33:48.560 --> 33:49.560
this best slinky movie.

33:49.560 --> 33:55.160
And you have all these outside like things and it's like, it's like carbohydrates.

33:55.160 --> 33:59.400
Like it fills your blood sugar and then, and you, as long as you keep stuffing your face

33:59.400 --> 34:03.160
with Snickers bars, you don't know that you're running on purely blood sugar.

34:03.160 --> 34:07.680
And then two, one of two things happened, you run out of Snickers and you get starving

34:07.680 --> 34:12.520
or you get really fat and you're also unhappy because you're working 50 jobs for Gwyneth

34:12.520 --> 34:18.080
Johnsonberg and slinky and none of them are passionate and that's like, again, you're

34:18.080 --> 34:21.440
just like, you just feel like you're, you're miserable.

34:21.440 --> 34:25.640
And then, then there's the Atkins diet of creativity. This is a bad metaphor because

34:25.640 --> 34:33.120
you're vegetarian, but, but, but it's like, it's that other thing of like, you know, and,

34:33.120 --> 34:38.920
and, you know, like, like, like what Jeff had said, like, is this about, is this about

34:38.920 --> 34:45.120
profession or is this about creative because they are, they can be two different things.

34:45.120 --> 34:50.160
And I think you're, you're, you're well aware of the fact that you don't want Robert DeNiro

34:50.160 --> 34:55.720
to drop through a skylight and be like, I, I want you to make a bullwinkle movie with

34:55.720 --> 34:58.080
me. Like that's not going to make you happy right now.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.080
No.

34:59.080 --> 35:05.880
And, and you don't need it. And, and so it's like, I think it's like, it's the other things

35:05.880 --> 35:10.440
that we're talking about. Like you feel like when Eddie Murphy went up at the House of

35:10.440 --> 35:14.400
Blues and started singing about how he didn't feel like he was funny anymore after Pluto

35:14.400 --> 35:20.280
and Ash or something, like you're feel, you're feeling midlife like creative crisis. Yeah.

35:20.280 --> 35:28.160
You know, it's, it's, you know, it's like you get the, the phone calls from, you know,

35:28.160 --> 35:32.840
like, Hey, there's a meeting. These people want to meet you. And you're just like, no,

35:32.840 --> 35:40.840
no, I don't, I don't want to. Well, why not? I just don't feel like driving to San Diego,

35:40.840 --> 35:45.840
being stuck in traffic for something that's a meet and greet that's just not going to

35:45.840 --> 35:53.800
go anywhere or anywhere I want to, you know, to do the fucking Captain Crunch movie or,

35:53.800 --> 35:58.200
you know, the electrician's a serial killer movie.

35:58.200 --> 36:02.800
Are you feeling Rob? Are you feeling more creative or less creative now? Do you do you

36:02.800 --> 36:03.800
feel?

36:03.800 --> 36:09.920
I'm feeling dead. I'm feeling done. And it's, and it's hard because if it was just living

36:09.920 --> 36:19.160
alone, but I have my insecurities about my, my wife, who's younger than me, you know,

36:19.160 --> 36:26.920
going, I didn't sign up for this. I didn't sign up to live with a zombie. Well, I mean,

36:26.920 --> 36:31.280
that goes back and forth. She'll, she'll be drawing checks from the account of your relationship

36:31.280 --> 36:36.640
at some point when she's feeling down. She, she loves you. She's not, she did sign up

36:36.640 --> 36:43.720
for this. She, she doesn't, she didn't have a preconceived, like she didn't want you to

36:43.720 --> 36:48.400
be energetic when she married you. She wasn't going, I've been with you for seven years,

36:48.400 --> 36:53.520
but I like, I have this condition. I'm not sharing in my vows, which is that I want you

36:53.520 --> 36:55.480
to be bubbly every day.

36:55.480 --> 37:00.880
She's a creator too. Like she makes stuff and also like she has to deal with her own

37:00.880 --> 37:06.360
like ups and downs and the creative process. Like, like she doesn't work at a bakery. She

37:06.360 --> 37:11.440
also wants to make things and she's a creator and you're, you're both dealing with the same.

37:11.440 --> 37:16.760
We're going to get so many tweets from people at Dunkin Donuts and bakeries. Like they've

37:16.760 --> 37:24.360
twice now been used as a, as an, as an example of people that have no point to, to live and

37:24.360 --> 37:29.480
are contributing nothing. I'm going to get that usual tweet from the fight for 15 minimum

37:29.480 --> 37:35.480
wage socialist people. Spencer, you, if I may, like you sent a pretty dark tweet out

37:35.480 --> 37:39.400
today where you said you wanted to die, you're done.

37:39.400 --> 37:45.280
This is like playing prices, right? But it's like the price of life and the closer to zero

37:45.280 --> 37:46.280
you get, you,

37:46.280 --> 37:53.200
Oh, is it, was that a joke or a creative like, like desperation or just, or it was really

37:53.200 --> 37:55.600
funny, right? It wasn't a hilarious, hilarious.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.600
What was it?

37:56.600 --> 38:04.320
They're like, man, that is classic setup payoff. Oh boy. Yeah. No, I don't know. It was bad.

38:04.320 --> 38:08.760
I'm in a bad place. I, like I said, I feel like Rob does. I feel, I feel, I identify

38:08.760 --> 38:12.520
very strongly with everything you're saying. I don't know. I had the thought that, and

38:12.520 --> 38:16.920
this may or may not make any sense, but like the whole concept of a midlife crisis, it

38:16.920 --> 38:22.520
might be like this biological, what do you call it? Reproduction instinct. Like, like

38:22.520 --> 38:27.480
after you go so far, suddenly the light goes out of the world and it kind of becomes gray.

38:27.480 --> 38:31.400
And the reason it becomes gray is because then you can see the world fresh new color

38:31.400 --> 38:36.120
once you have a kid. It kind of, basically it's like new game plus on the world and

38:36.120 --> 38:40.560
it kind of just changes your perspective and lets you kind of become comfortable with the

38:40.560 --> 38:44.600
idea of it's not about my happiness. It's not about me being the protagonist in the

38:44.600 --> 38:49.320
world. It's about being part of this community that is then putting forth new people that

38:49.320 --> 38:50.320
are then the new.

38:50.320 --> 38:55.320
You're looking at things that are going to stale through fresh eyes. It's like when

38:55.320 --> 38:59.880
you're a fan of like, say, Star Trek or Dungeons and Dragons and you're teaching somebody who's

38:59.880 --> 39:04.480
never done it before, it's boom. It's just like, so you have a kid and you go, this

39:04.480 --> 39:06.680
is Christmas, this is Easter, this is fun.

39:06.680 --> 39:10.640
You've got a whole new life. It's like the second chapter, like it's everything about

39:10.640 --> 39:12.840
your life you get to redo over.

39:12.840 --> 39:18.080
But I've been having midlife crisis sees my entire life.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.880
Yeah, but humans used to live until 30, right?

39:20.880 --> 39:22.600
You've gone through a lot of midlives, yeah.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.600
Yes.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.000
You're like the cat of middle age.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Yes.

39:26.000 --> 39:33.480
Yeah, I think it has something to do with, I think, a typical Dunkin' Donuts of shit

39:33.480 --> 39:34.880
eating bakery worker.

39:34.880 --> 39:35.880
Okay.

39:35.880 --> 39:43.600
Dan, let's lay off the donuts for a while.

39:43.600 --> 39:48.360
Time Magazine can identify one midlife and one midlife crisis and creatives are constantly

39:48.360 --> 39:54.320
dying and resurrecting in their minds. I think that you guys are hitting the nail on the

39:54.320 --> 39:56.960
head because it all has to do with the future.

39:56.960 --> 40:02.960
When you're 25, you don't really realize that what's keeping you going is thinking unconsciously

40:02.960 --> 40:09.640
about how life's going to be when you're 35.

40:09.640 --> 40:14.880
That energy just permeates you even though if anyone asked you and you consciously answered

40:14.880 --> 40:20.560
the question, like, so what's it like being so young and like having your whole life ahead

40:20.560 --> 40:26.520
of you, we were all there. We would grouse and be like, what do you mean, my whole life?

40:26.520 --> 40:32.360
I should have done something by the time I was 21, blah, blah, blah, and also even if

40:32.360 --> 40:36.120
you were an optimistic person, you'd be like, look, I'm not a materialist, so I don't care

40:36.120 --> 40:40.320
about the future. I don't care what's going to happen. I'm not thinking about that. And

40:40.320 --> 40:46.600
you'd pass a polygraph test, but when you get to 35, you then start to realize that

40:46.600 --> 40:54.960
you, oh, there's some tank that's emptying here and I can't quite put my finger on it.

40:54.960 --> 41:01.080
And then you get to 45 and you're like, aha, I know what that tank is. That tank is thinking

41:01.080 --> 41:06.440
about the future. It is just the idea of the future.

41:06.440 --> 41:11.120
But here's the glorious invitation that that represents because this isn't an epiphany

41:11.120 --> 41:15.760
we're having when we're 70, which would be fine to have it then, like, unforgiven. We

41:15.760 --> 41:20.840
could take a shotgun into town and just blow everyone away in the rain. But to have it

41:20.840 --> 41:28.280
when you're truly middle-aged is to truly say, oh, my thought about the future tank

41:28.280 --> 41:35.440
is empty. That's a good tank to be empty. It's like going into ketosis and I'm now going

41:35.440 --> 41:39.600
to have to actually live off of the moment. And Jeff is saying that in one way. He's an

41:39.600 --> 41:47.120
actor. He's going like, he broke through to, I'm just a wandering minstrel and I found

41:47.120 --> 41:52.520
joy in like, send me on a plane to India, send me here, as long as I'm always working

41:52.520 --> 41:56.160
with people that I love and I'm getting paid to do what I love and I don't have to work

41:56.160 --> 42:01.440
in a shit-hole bakery with the fucking disgusting bakers.

42:01.440 --> 42:05.120
We're talking to you, Duncan Donuts. We're talking to you, bakers of America,

42:05.120 --> 42:12.960
you gross fucking yeast shit. Who wants to be a fucking baker? You disgusting

42:12.960 --> 42:20.440
milk-fed fucking 90 IQ donut wranglers. You tell me what yeast even is, bakers, and

42:20.440 --> 42:25.680
I'll fucking give you a donut. I'll tell you what's not rising. Your life,

42:25.680 --> 42:31.600
you pieces of shit. And there will be no comeuppance for this. There will never be

42:31.600 --> 42:38.200
a working class revolution in this country. We should keep saying that. I think that might

42:38.200 --> 42:42.560
be a good idea. They're like just angrily. They'll never, like just in public, there

42:42.560 --> 42:48.400
will never be a working class uprising. Just get enough people to say that. All these teenagers

42:48.400 --> 42:53.840
are like, what the fuck does this guy know? We're going to fucking riot. I think that

42:53.840 --> 42:58.440
could work. I mean, it's a joke. You're the guy Fox of not having a mask.

42:58.440 --> 43:09.240
Anyways, but I mean, that's what we need to get through to, is just that I'm waking

43:09.240 --> 43:15.560
up and there's a depressing way of saying it, that you're waking up and there's nothing.

43:15.560 --> 43:20.120
And then there's also a really, you know. No, there's definitely a way that you could

43:20.120 --> 43:26.680
go, you know, oh man. This is heaven. The things that I've always wanted to do, I've

43:26.680 --> 43:33.920
done, and I'm kind of sick of it. You know, I'm kind of sick of my own shit, you know.

43:33.920 --> 43:40.040
But at the same time, I could go, but now's the time to change. You know, now's the time

43:40.040 --> 43:43.840
to do something different. Now's the time to invent a new style.

43:43.840 --> 43:49.040
I'll tell you something you've always had over me is, like, I've never had the balls

43:49.040 --> 43:55.400
to say no to the Clifford, the big red dog meeting or the so-and-so wants to meet you.

43:55.400 --> 44:01.240
I'm all, I can't shake this terror, but I need to. It's being forced upon me that I

44:01.240 --> 44:06.520
need to because I've done nothing but, you know, spread myself thin and botch a bunch

44:06.520 --> 44:16.720
of projects. Like, I need to just say no thank you to the Jenga phone call, the Jenga movie.

44:16.720 --> 44:20.640
But instead, I just keep going, like, well, do you think he'll set it in the future and

44:20.640 --> 44:25.400
taking that call? And then, of course, he says yes, but he's lying, you know. Like,

44:25.400 --> 44:30.480
if you go into the fucking Jenga office and, you know, in Sino, and-

44:30.480 --> 44:31.480
I just, I just, I-

44:31.480 --> 44:34.840
Is it a riff or is it actually a Jenga?

44:34.840 --> 44:36.000
It's based in truth.

44:36.000 --> 44:46.680
I can't, I can't, it's so hard to do anything creative, for me, that I can't do it unless

44:46.680 --> 44:51.560
I love it. And I gotta figure out a way to love it. If I can figure out a way to love

44:51.560 --> 44:59.360
it, I'll do it. But if I can't, I'm like, I'm waiting everybody's time. So, yeah, I

44:59.360 --> 45:05.840
don't work as often as I probably could, and I could have a bigger savings account than

45:05.840 --> 45:13.120
I do, but I just kind of, I do what I, whatever I want, you know. And right now, I'm like in

45:13.120 --> 45:18.640
a scary place because I, you know, this is what depression feels like, is like, I don't

45:18.640 --> 45:24.560
want to do anything ever again, and I feel like it's gonna be ever again. And then, eventually,

45:24.560 --> 45:29.080
my wife's gonna leave me, my dog's gonna die, I'm gonna have a no savings account, and you're

45:29.080 --> 45:33.280
just gonna bury me in that apartment that I've been living in for the last 20 years,

45:33.280 --> 45:35.040
because I'm afraid to move out.

45:35.040 --> 45:39.360
Hmm. Maybe you'll feel better if I do a rap. Hit it.

45:39.360 --> 45:42.000
Zach, you gotta be-

45:42.000 --> 45:48.880
Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont-

45:48.880 --> 45:49.840
Yo, a Russian,

45:49.840 --> 45:54.560
Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, and Belmont walk into a-

45:54.560 --> 45:55.880
I got in a canoe,

45:55.880 --> 46:01.120
I rode it to your house, and I got out my shoe, and I, I squatted over it, and I took a poo,

46:01.120 --> 46:06.280
and then I had a shoe filled with poo in my canoe, and I gave it to you, and you said,

46:06.280 --> 46:11.880
what you gonna do, and I said, I'm gonna take another poo in my canoe, and I threw my shoe,

46:11.880 --> 46:17.220
And it went over there, and I saw your mama with her bright red hair, and I said,

46:17.220 --> 46:19.820
Goddamn!

46:19.820 --> 46:21.320
Poo-ka-noo!

46:21.320 --> 46:22.820
Undercats!

46:22.820 --> 46:25.820
It's a poo-ka-noo!

46:25.820 --> 46:28.820
Poo-ka-noo!

46:28.820 --> 46:30.320
Sundercats ho!

46:30.320 --> 46:31.820
Sundercats there!

46:31.820 --> 46:37.520
Sundercats all over Chitara's bare leotard.

46:37.520 --> 46:40.120
I'm flashing back to ten years old.

46:40.120 --> 46:42.120
Alright, get away from that area.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.120
Tricky, bad area.

46:44.120 --> 46:46.120
Poo-ka-noo!

46:46.120 --> 46:48.120
Yo!

46:48.120 --> 46:50.120
Okay, nope.

46:50.120 --> 46:52.120
Poo-ka-noo!

46:52.120 --> 46:54.120
One more time.

46:54.120 --> 46:56.120
There it is.

46:56.120 --> 46:58.120
Poo-ka-noo!

46:58.120 --> 47:00.120
Give me some.

47:00.120 --> 47:02.120
Give me some.

47:02.120 --> 47:04.120
Poo-ka-noo!

47:04.120 --> 47:06.120
A rubber can for the poo.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.120
Alright, you're giving me stuff.

47:08.120 --> 47:10.120
Depression, depression, depression, okay, depression.

47:10.120 --> 47:15.120
Yo, yo, yo, depression, yo, depression, rap.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.120
Here we go, yo.

47:17.120 --> 47:23.120
D to the E to the P-R-E to the S-S-I-O-N-E.

47:23.120 --> 47:25.120
That's French for depression.

47:25.120 --> 47:34.120
Alright, D to the E to the P-R-E to the S-S-I in the O-N-E.

47:34.120 --> 47:36.120
That's depression in French.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.120
What the fuck?

47:37.120 --> 47:39.120
Alright.

47:39.120 --> 47:41.120
Chocolate mint ice cream.

47:41.120 --> 47:45.120
Chocolate mint ice cream is the here to say.

47:45.120 --> 47:47.120
Donuts.

47:47.120 --> 47:49.120
Dunkin' donut bakeries.

47:49.120 --> 47:51.120
Donut bakeries.

47:51.120 --> 47:53.120
Donut industry.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.120
Yeah, yeah, okay, good.

47:55.120 --> 47:57.120
Let's pump those bakers back up.

47:57.120 --> 47:59.120
Yo, yo.

47:59.120 --> 48:01.120
I wake up in the morning and I make the dough.

48:01.120 --> 48:04.120
I gotta roll it all around like the shit with snow.

48:04.120 --> 48:07.120
And I'm not making a man and I'm not making an igloo.

48:07.120 --> 48:11.120
I'm making things that you need to eat to do what you do.

48:11.120 --> 48:15.120
So you do to thank me for giving you fuel

48:15.120 --> 48:17.120
so you can go off on your spankings

48:17.120 --> 48:19.120
because you're a professional spanker

48:19.120 --> 48:22.120
or you're a carpenter or you're a banker.

48:22.120 --> 48:25.120
I'm just a lowly donut maker

48:25.120 --> 48:28.120
but you shit down on me because shit rolls downhill.

48:28.120 --> 48:30.120
Oh, fuck you.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.120
I'm sorry, I'm not Dr. Phil.

48:32.120 --> 48:33.120
Why is he so great?

48:33.120 --> 48:34.120
You hate him.

48:34.120 --> 48:37.120
So what, what, what do you work at a gym?

48:37.120 --> 48:39.120
Like, I make fucking donuts.

48:39.120 --> 48:41.120
No, you just make the opposite of them by working at a gym

48:41.120 --> 48:42.120
if you think about it.

48:42.120 --> 48:44.120
It's a weird cycle.

48:44.120 --> 48:46.120
I make the donuts and then you go to the gym

48:46.120 --> 48:51.120
and then you make the donuts come out of your body.

48:51.120 --> 48:58.120
Yo.

48:58.120 --> 48:59.120
Thunder cats.

48:59.120 --> 49:01.120
Oh.

49:01.120 --> 49:03.120
Thunder cats rap.

49:03.120 --> 49:05.120
Thunder cats rap.

49:05.120 --> 49:07.120
Lord of Omens, give me sight beyond sight.

49:07.120 --> 49:10.120
I fucked your mama so hard that I made it less tight

49:10.120 --> 49:13.120
that I found Snark and said, what are you doing?

49:13.120 --> 49:15.120
And he said, Snarf.

49:15.120 --> 49:18.120
And I said, I'm sorry, I got your name wrong.

49:18.120 --> 49:20.120
Pantera.

49:20.120 --> 49:21.120
Pantera.

49:21.120 --> 49:23.120
Was uncomfortable.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.120
That was good.

49:24.120 --> 49:25.120
All right.

49:25.120 --> 49:26.120
That was good.

49:26.120 --> 49:27.120
That was a good one.

49:27.120 --> 49:29.120
I feel, I feel bad.

49:29.120 --> 49:32.120
Rob, do you feel, do you feel more activated as a creator now

49:32.120 --> 49:33.120
after that?

49:33.120 --> 49:34.120
I think so.

49:34.120 --> 49:36.120
I mean, I thought maybe there would be some.

49:36.120 --> 49:37.120
I think so.

49:37.120 --> 49:41.120
I thought maybe if I stirred the pot a little bit

49:41.120 --> 49:44.120
there would be some creative energies.

49:44.120 --> 49:47.120
Like maybe we would go, oh yeah, we should talk about

49:47.120 --> 49:48.120
Thunder cats.

49:48.120 --> 49:50.120
What was going on in that cartoon?

49:50.120 --> 49:57.120
Um, I think Pantera and Chitara were an item.

49:57.120 --> 49:59.120
I don't think, I think they were keeping it quiet

49:59.120 --> 50:01.120
because the kids were around.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.120
But they would, they would always kind of like,

50:03.120 --> 50:06.120
because WilyKit and WilyKat were always around too much

50:06.120 --> 50:09.120
and you know that Pantera, if he had his moment.

50:09.120 --> 50:10.120
I said Pantera.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.120
Yeah.

50:11.120 --> 50:12.120
Pantera is a band.

50:12.120 --> 50:14.120
I can't believe I've lost all of the Thunder cat.

50:14.120 --> 50:15.120
I'm losing my Thunder cats.

50:15.120 --> 50:17.120
Name all of the Thunder cats.

50:17.120 --> 50:18.120
Lionel.

50:18.120 --> 50:19.120
Lionel.

50:19.120 --> 50:20.120
Lionel.

50:20.120 --> 50:21.120
The train.

50:21.120 --> 50:22.120
Lionel.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.120
Lionel.

50:23.120 --> 50:24.120
Right.

50:24.120 --> 50:25.120
Panthro.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.120
Chitara.

50:26.120 --> 50:28.120
Now it's going to get harder.

50:28.120 --> 50:29.120
Okay.

50:29.120 --> 50:31.120
Tigro.

50:31.120 --> 50:33.120
I don't think so.

50:33.120 --> 50:34.120
Tigro?

50:34.120 --> 50:35.120
Lettigra?

50:35.120 --> 50:37.120
Lettigra was a rat man.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.120
There was a fucking tiger.

50:38.120 --> 50:39.120
What was his name?

50:39.120 --> 50:41.120
Shroeder.

50:41.120 --> 50:42.120
Oh.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.120
Shroeder.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.120
What was the tiger?

50:44.120 --> 50:45.120
Wait, why are you guys high-roading me?

50:45.120 --> 50:46.120
I don't think that's his name.

50:46.120 --> 50:48.120
What was the tiger's name?

50:48.120 --> 50:51.120
We're not high-roading you by thinking you're wrong.

50:51.120 --> 50:52.120
Tigro.

50:52.120 --> 50:53.120
Okay.

50:53.120 --> 50:56.120
And the animal.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.120
Tigro.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.120
Lionel.

50:58.120 --> 50:59.120
Chitara.

50:59.120 --> 51:00.120
They feminized her name and then it would be Tigro.

51:00.120 --> 51:01.120
And what are the kids?

51:01.120 --> 51:02.120
Whitful and whenful.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.120
No, no, no.

51:03.120 --> 51:05.120
I forgot they were kids.

51:05.120 --> 51:06.120
I just said them.

51:06.120 --> 51:07.120
What was the—

51:07.120 --> 51:08.120
I know you did by the way.

51:08.120 --> 51:11.120
And then there was a Obi-Wan, kind of ghost guy.

51:11.120 --> 51:12.120
Mumra?

51:12.120 --> 51:13.120
No.

51:13.120 --> 51:14.120
That was the bad person.

51:14.120 --> 51:15.120
Oh, that was—yeah, I don't know who the—

51:15.120 --> 51:16.120
He's not a fucking Thunder cat.

51:16.120 --> 51:17.120
Okay.

51:17.120 --> 51:18.120
All right—

51:18.120 --> 51:19.120
Orco.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.120
Orco.

51:20.120 --> 51:21.120
Get them.

51:21.120 --> 51:22.120
No, Orco.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.120
5 Smurfs and not Smurfette.

51:24.120 --> 51:25.120
Name 5 Smurfs.

51:25.120 --> 51:27.120
Name 5 Smurfs.

51:27.120 --> 51:38.120
Brainy, Vanity, Chastity, Virtue Signal, Cuck.

51:38.120 --> 51:39.120
Cuck.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.120
Cuck.

51:40.120 --> 51:41.120
Cuck holds Smurf.

51:41.120 --> 51:42.120
Cuck holds Smurf.

51:42.120 --> 51:43.120
Libtard, Soyboy.

51:43.120 --> 51:45.120
These are good Smurfs.

51:45.120 --> 51:47.120
These are great Smurfs.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.120
No one updated.

51:48.120 --> 51:51.120
They didn't update the Smurfs properly.

51:51.120 --> 51:52.120
Libtard.

51:52.120 --> 51:53.120
Libtard.

51:53.120 --> 51:54.120
Cuck holds.

51:54.120 --> 52:00.120
You know that Brainy Smurf would be super a snowflake Smurf.

52:00.120 --> 52:02.120
Snowflake, Libtard.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.120
Soyboy.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.120
Cuck.

52:04.120 --> 52:05.120
Yeah.

52:05.120 --> 52:08.120
Yeah.

52:08.120 --> 52:09.120
Heartbleeder.

52:09.120 --> 52:15.120
Yeah, what is that Brainy, Vanity?

52:15.120 --> 52:18.120
I remember Vanity.

52:18.120 --> 52:19.120
Hefty.

52:19.120 --> 52:20.120
What the fuck?

52:20.120 --> 52:21.120
What the fuck were the Smurfs?

52:21.120 --> 52:22.120
You know, that was a bad problem.

52:22.120 --> 52:23.120
He was a strong Smurf.

52:23.120 --> 52:25.120
The only Smurf for you.

52:25.120 --> 52:26.120
Papa.

52:26.120 --> 52:27.120
Papa.

52:27.120 --> 52:28.120
That's obvious.

52:28.120 --> 52:29.120
Oh, Handy.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.120
Handy.

52:30.120 --> 52:31.120
My name is Hefty.

52:31.120 --> 52:32.120
Handy Smurf.

52:32.120 --> 52:33.120
Did he have the pencil?

52:33.120 --> 52:34.120
No, that was the Brainy.

52:34.120 --> 52:35.120
Oh.

52:35.120 --> 52:38.120
Handy Smurf was like, he was basically Andy on WKRP.

52:38.120 --> 52:40.120
That's how I remember him.

52:40.120 --> 52:41.120
That's a deep cut.

52:41.120 --> 52:42.120
Hefty Smurf.

52:42.120 --> 52:44.120
Hefty is one for sure.

52:44.120 --> 52:45.120
Hefty Smurf.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.120
Hefty?

52:46.120 --> 52:48.120
The only Smurf for you is one who has true blue.

52:48.120 --> 52:49.120
That Smurf is me.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.120
My name is Hefty.

52:50.120 --> 52:51.120
This is not a real Smurf.

52:51.120 --> 52:53.120
They were all writing songs.

52:53.120 --> 52:58.120
What fucking Israeli Smurf ripoff did you grow up on?

52:58.120 --> 53:04.120
They were all trying to woo Smurfette in one episode, and they all wrote songs or did

53:04.120 --> 53:05.120
things.

53:05.120 --> 53:07.120
I don't remember Hefty at all.

53:07.120 --> 53:11.120
I will eat my fucking potato chip hat if Hefty Smurf is not a real Smurf.

53:11.120 --> 53:15.120
Well, I doubt you'd lie about it or get it wrong.

53:15.120 --> 53:16.120
Hefty Smurf is the same.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.120
Is he big?

53:17.120 --> 53:18.120
Is he big and strong?

53:18.120 --> 53:19.120
He's the Hefty Smurf.

53:19.120 --> 53:20.120
He's good looking.

53:20.120 --> 53:21.120
Yeah.

53:21.120 --> 53:22.120
He's the macho Smurf.

53:22.120 --> 53:23.120
Unlike Vanity.

53:23.120 --> 53:26.120
Vanity had flowers and talked with an English accent.

53:26.120 --> 53:30.120
And he always had a handheld mirror with him at all times.

53:30.120 --> 53:36.120
Vanity was ginger from Gilligan's Island, but then you got handy and brainy.

53:36.120 --> 53:37.120
It's like you split your professor.

53:37.120 --> 53:38.120
Yeah.

53:38.120 --> 53:39.120
If he's so handy, why is he got the pencil?

53:39.120 --> 53:43.120
He had the pencil behind the ears and the slide rule, and he knew how to make shit.

53:43.120 --> 53:44.120
Out of mushrooms.

53:44.120 --> 53:47.120
But Brainy knew how to not make shit.

53:47.120 --> 53:51.120
Brainy just stand over a handy shoulder and go, like, you shouldn't do that.

53:51.120 --> 53:53.120
Brainy's like, this needs aerodynamics.

53:53.120 --> 53:54.120
Gargamel's cat.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.120
Because air falls.

53:55.120 --> 53:56.120
Asriel.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.120
Oh, shit.

53:57.120 --> 53:58.120
He fucking got it.

53:58.120 --> 53:59.120
He got it.

53:59.120 --> 54:00.120
Drop it.

54:00.120 --> 54:01.120
Drop it.

54:01.120 --> 54:02.120
What did he do?

54:02.120 --> 54:03.120
That was the cat?

54:03.120 --> 54:05.120
I asked, what was the name of Gargamel's cat?

54:05.120 --> 54:06.120
And he got it.

54:06.120 --> 54:07.120
Asriel.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.120
Asriel.

54:08.120 --> 54:09.120
Okay.

54:09.120 --> 54:11.120
So the Coleco vision came with Smurf, the video game.

54:11.120 --> 54:16.120
By the way, if you're a subscriber, and you're under 50, goodbye.

54:16.120 --> 54:20.120
And I say that with no hate for you or us.

54:20.120 --> 54:21.120
I'm happy.

54:21.120 --> 54:29.120
And if you're not, type Coleco vision into Google search and whatever.

54:29.120 --> 54:32.120
What was the game play on the Smurf?

54:32.120 --> 54:34.120
Let me tell you something.

54:34.120 --> 54:37.120
Hardest fucking game ever.

54:37.120 --> 54:43.120
I remember Christmas morning, we got the Coleco vision, and we were shitting our pants because

54:43.120 --> 54:45.120
it was like real arcade graphics.

54:45.120 --> 54:46.120
Yeah.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.120
In your home.

54:47.120 --> 54:49.120
Coleco was like pharmaceutical cocaine.

54:49.120 --> 54:50.120
Yeah.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.120
It was fucking amazing.

54:51.120 --> 54:52.120
16 bits.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.120
Ramstack had a Coleco.

54:54.120 --> 54:55.120
It's good, right?

54:55.120 --> 54:56.120
Nobody else had a Coleco.

54:56.120 --> 54:57.120
Ramstack had a Coleco.

54:57.120 --> 54:59.120
We put in Smurf.

54:59.120 --> 55:01.120
We put in Smurf.

55:01.120 --> 55:03.120
Couldn't get past the first screen.

55:03.120 --> 55:04.120
What was the game play?

55:04.120 --> 55:05.120
Who are you?

55:05.120 --> 55:11.120
You're a Smurf trying to get Smurf fed out of Gargamel's crib.

55:11.120 --> 55:18.120
It's a scrolling game, it starts out mushroom on one side of the frame, a fence on the other.

55:18.120 --> 55:22.120
And it would go do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

55:22.120 --> 55:26.120
And you would have to jump over the fence.

55:26.120 --> 55:32.120
And with those fucking weird ass Coleco vision joysticks, which was like a knob.

55:32.120 --> 55:33.120
Did you use the numpad?

55:33.120 --> 55:34.120
On a phone pad.

55:34.120 --> 55:35.120
Yeah.

55:35.120 --> 55:37.120
Which was like, what the hell?

55:37.120 --> 55:39.120
What am I supposed to do with this?

55:39.120 --> 55:46.120
You're supposed to jump and move at the same time, which was almost impossible.

55:46.120 --> 55:55.120
So we're trying to do this and we're trying to jump over the fence of the first screen.

55:55.120 --> 55:58.120
And Jeff, Steven, me, we couldn't do it.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.120
We couldn't do it.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.120
Those are the Schrab Brothers.

56:00.120 --> 56:03.120
We're doing it for hours and hours and hours.

56:03.120 --> 56:04.120
We could do it.

56:04.120 --> 56:06.120
And all three of us are crying.

56:06.120 --> 56:09.120
We're screen crying.

56:09.120 --> 56:14.120
And David and Donna Schrab, my parents are going, it's just, you know, it's just a really hard game.

56:14.120 --> 56:17.120
You got to practice it, but it's not even fun.

56:17.120 --> 56:23.120
Or that quote that made me want to murder my whole family and burn the house down.

56:23.120 --> 56:24.120
If it makes you that angry.

56:24.120 --> 56:25.120
Yeah, if it makes it.

56:25.120 --> 56:29.120
It's just like after the third time that you go, God damn it.

56:29.120 --> 56:35.120
And you just hear from the kitchen, if it makes you that angry, why do you keep playing it?

56:35.120 --> 56:41.120
And I remember mom, I want to talk to you about your marriage.

56:41.120 --> 56:43.120
Well, that's the thing.

56:43.120 --> 56:47.120
It's like, yeah, I guess a game you haven't passed the first level on.

56:47.120 --> 56:51.120
Let's apply that to just real life instead of games.

56:51.120 --> 56:55.120
Yeah, I just wanted to take a dig that would put my rift in my family.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.120
Back in the days when I was, I'm kidding, mom.

56:57.120 --> 57:03.120
I think on the off chance, my mom likes me enough now to just watching this and that would, mom, I'm doing a joke.

57:03.120 --> 57:05.120
What was the video game?

57:05.120 --> 57:07.120
Dragon's Lair?

57:07.120 --> 57:09.120
Right, Dragon's Lair?

57:09.120 --> 57:10.120
Space Ace and Dragon's Lair.

57:10.120 --> 57:12.120
You can get Space Ace and Dragon's Lair.

57:12.120 --> 57:14.120
It was $0.50 or $1 to play it.

57:14.120 --> 57:17.120
And you couldn't get through fucking 15 seconds.

57:17.120 --> 57:22.120
Because you're watching a cartoon, a Don Bluth cartoon, and just having to memorize when to put it down.

57:22.120 --> 57:32.120
It was basically a DVD remote control, and you weren't going chapter searching with this fucking piece of shit.

57:32.120 --> 57:33.120
Same thing with Donkey Kong.

57:33.120 --> 57:35.120
Donkey Kong is a memorization game.

57:35.120 --> 57:37.120
It's all about memorizing it.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.120
And jumping barrels.

57:39.120 --> 57:40.120
Hell yeah.

57:40.120 --> 57:44.120
Do you guys remember when DVDs first came out?

57:44.120 --> 57:48.120
That was the most important high five in podcast history.

57:48.120 --> 57:52.120
The three year period during which the porn industry ever forward.

57:52.120 --> 57:56.120
It's written on the porn industry's seal in Latin.

57:56.120 --> 57:58.120
Ever, ever forward.

57:58.120 --> 58:03.120
What's that French quote about audacity?

58:03.120 --> 58:07.120
That's the French.

58:07.120 --> 58:09.120
Always forward.

58:09.120 --> 58:17.120
DVDs hadn't been in existence for a year and wouldn't have been if it weren't for the porn industry.

58:17.120 --> 58:21.120
And then also at the same time, you would get a porn on DVD.

58:21.120 --> 58:26.120
And the menu would always include sex game.

58:26.120 --> 58:28.120
And you'd be like, what?

58:28.120 --> 58:32.120
And then it would be like this fucking hallway.

58:32.120 --> 58:34.120
Like Wolfenstein graphic.

58:34.120 --> 58:38.120
And it would be like this weird, it's just playing a video of a hallway.

58:38.120 --> 58:41.120
And you're supposed to just use the tracks.

58:41.120 --> 58:45.120
What do you think they came here for?

58:45.120 --> 58:48.120
What do you think we came to Space Station 69 for?

58:48.120 --> 58:51.120
Go down a hallway and turn left and open a door.

58:51.120 --> 58:53.120
And there's a pussy.

58:53.120 --> 58:56.120
And then you click on the pussy and it's just a video clip.

58:56.120 --> 58:57.120
You know what?

58:57.120 --> 59:01.120
Jerking off wasn't fun until you guys added hallways.

59:01.120 --> 59:03.120
But you can't blame them.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.120
You can't blame porn for being a...

59:05.120 --> 59:06.120
Trying.

59:06.120 --> 59:10.120
Porn is like the head of North Korea.

59:10.120 --> 59:11.120
It's a Kim Jong-un.

59:11.120 --> 59:13.120
I can't remember which one we're on.

59:13.120 --> 59:16.120
But it's like that thing of like you're a paranoid...

59:16.120 --> 59:18.120
Porn is a paranoid dictator.

59:18.120 --> 59:22.120
It knows that if it lets it's guard down for a second, it will be assassinated.

59:22.120 --> 59:27.120
We will figure out a way to do away with porn if porn doesn't stay relevant.

59:27.120 --> 59:28.120
It's just like such a...

59:28.120 --> 59:31.120
And so it's always out there just like nervous and sweaty.

59:31.120 --> 59:33.120
Like a...

59:33.120 --> 59:36.120
Like a banana peel on Ron Jeremy's shoulder.

59:36.120 --> 59:38.120
It's a...

59:38.120 --> 59:41.120
The guy in Casablanca, the actor who's sweaty is...

59:41.120 --> 59:42.120
Oh, Rick.

59:42.120 --> 59:43.120
I don't know.

59:43.120 --> 59:44.120
Bogart.

59:44.120 --> 59:45.120
No, the other guy.

59:45.120 --> 59:47.120
The guy who sounds like Ren.

59:47.120 --> 59:48.120
Peter Lorre.

59:48.120 --> 59:49.120
Peter Lorre.

59:49.120 --> 59:51.120
Porn has the personality of Peter Lorre.

59:51.120 --> 59:52.120
This is always...

59:52.120 --> 59:53.120
Rick.

59:53.120 --> 59:54.120
Rick.

59:54.120 --> 59:55.120
You want to jerk off.

59:55.120 --> 59:59.120
Now that DVDs are up, maybe Rick, we should maybe make an interactive kind of porn.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.120
Rick, huh?

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.120
And the American viewer is just like, hey, why don't you take it easy?

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.120
See, sweetheart, I guess.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.120
I'll jerk off when I want to jerk off.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.120
But Rick, that's not going to keep me alive, Rick.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.120
Now do Ingrid Bergman.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.120
I want you to be a porn version.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.120
I want you to be a porn hub of all of these characters.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.120
It's not a tumor.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.120
That's not a tumor.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.120
That's a good Ingrid Bergman.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.120
I don't know what Ingrid Bergman sounds like.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.120
Do Sidney Greenstreet.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.120
You must remember this.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.120
A kiss of...

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:35.120
He's not even in that movie.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.120
I don't know if racism is the crime that's committed there.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.120
If anything, lack of racism.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.120
If I could confuse the piano.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.120
Sam for Sidney Greenstreet.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.120
I think I'm post-racial.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.120
Louis Armstrong was Sam in that movie.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120
Have you ever seen the movie?

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.120
It's a good movie.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.120
Casablanca?

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.120
I don't think I've seen it.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.120
Did you know there was an alternate ending to it?

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.120
They changed the ending?

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.120
Zip.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.120
They kind of riffed it at the end.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:10.120
Do you want to riff another ending to Casablanca right now?

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:16.120
So Victor Laszlo and Ingrid Bergman, whatever her name is, Elsa.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.120
They got on the plane.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.120
So you got Claude Reigns and Humphrey Bogart.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:27.120
And Humphrey Bogart and Claude Reigns are in a sticky situation.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:31.120
Because each of them have been kind of traitors to their own laws.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.120
So you'd be Claude Reigns.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.120
Okay.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:40.120
It seems, Rick, that we are in a bad situation.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.120
You have to kill me or I have to arrest you.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:52.120
What's his name?

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:57.120
Lieutenant.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:05.120
You know, there comes a time in a man's life when he needs to...

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.120
Sorry, I have to take this call.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120
Telephone!

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:14.120
Thank you, Lieutenant Schwartz.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.120
You're welcome.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.120
He just stole my pen.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.120
If you're both lieutenants, how does he know to bring you the phone?

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.120
Well, then that's where you have me, Rick.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.120
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.120
Oh, sorry.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.120
Telephone!

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.120
Oh, now I got handed a phone.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:39.120
Maybe I'm a lieutenant too, sweetheart.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.120
Telephone!

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.120
That was for you.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120
Hello.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.120
Hello, sweetheart.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120
Hello.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.120
Hello.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.120
Hello.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.120
Is this America?

01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:02.120
You've got an American, sweetheart, but this is about a far away from America.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:08.120
New Jersey is from Hoboken, which isn't that far.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120
See?

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:12.120
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:17.120
Hey, hey, what are you...

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.120
What else are you doing over there?

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:22.120
Who's on your phone?

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.120
Shut up, John.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.120
Peter Lloyd's still alive.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.120
He didn't get killed in jail.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.120
He got arrested by the Gestapo, but he's still alive.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.120
Who was on your phone?

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.520
I was talking to the Vichy general

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.840
of the local police department.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.180
Brrr, uh-oh.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.000
Telephone.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Oh shit, there's a second phone, sweetheart.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.360
Do you want me to get rid of some

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.640
of these dead soldiers here?

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.720
All those phones, I didn't answer, yeah.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.320
Hello, and the other phone?

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.080
Sweetheart.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.720
Hello.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.640
Ingmar?

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.880
Rick, this is me.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.920
Are you Eva?

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.960
Rick, no, if you don't remember my name,

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.920
then I'll just hang up.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.560
Oh, sweetheart.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.680
You remember Paris, right?

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.840
Remember, you said we were off.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.920
You always have Paris, sweetheart.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.040
But we'll always have Paris, but you forgot my name.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.480
You know how to say my name, don't you, sweetheart?

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.320
Yes, your name is Rick.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.160
What's my name?

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.840
Just put your lips together and blow.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.680
No, that's a different movie, that's a different movie.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.720
Hold on, can I put you, can I just put you on my shoulder?

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.560
Hold on.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.640
Yes, my plan is taking off.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.440
I got a third phone, sweetheart.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.400
Hello?

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.640
Hey, could I please speak to Lionel?

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.960
Panthro.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.800
Is this Panthro?

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.320
No, this is Chetaro.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.040
Racist motherfucker.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.540
Shh.

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.440
Hey, I didn't hang up.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.920
Where's my Lionel?

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.720
Hello?

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.200
I'm going to put you on hold, sweetheart.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.520
Oh, I get it.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.240
I get it.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:01.960
Hello?

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:02.460
Hello?

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.840
Snarf, snarf, snarf.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.640
Oh, snarf, man.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.800
Let me put you on the phone with Chetaro

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.920
by turning the phone.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.560
Hey, where's Lionel?

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.040
Snarf, snarf.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.800
Oh, he's in the kitchen.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.080
Snarf.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.880
I'm going to go get him.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.360
Can I get you anything?

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.160
I can't remember the name of the movie

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.280
where he says put your lips together and blow

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.640
with Lauren Bacall.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.560
Oh, let me ask.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.200
Is that Key Largo?

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.040
No, it's not Key Largo.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.880
That was with, what's his fucking name?

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.600
BigSleep.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.840
No, that's a BigSleep.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.880
Maltese.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.720
Not the Maltese.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.440
Dance dancer in the dark.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.280
Snarf, snarf.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:44.200
Hey, Lionel, what was the name of the movie

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:49.280
where they say put your lips together and blow?

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.480
Lionel's not on your call, sweetheart.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.760
He's in the kitchen.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.640
Oh.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.440
Oh.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.360
Never mind.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:55.860
Hold on.

01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.360
Fuck this.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.600
What, what, Banthro?

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.920
Just in here making omelets.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.800
I'm Chitara.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.960
Chitara, I didn't recognize your voice.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.080
Do you recognize these?

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:16.960
Oh, sword of omens, lords of light.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.040
Those are incredible.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.680
Excuse me, there's a, the cat phone is ringing.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.180
Hello.

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.440
Have it, have not.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.440
Oh, click.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.360
Excuse me.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.800
I belong to a trivia club.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.400
Who the fuck was that?

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.320
Who's that?

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.240
That was the trivia club telling me what movie.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.800
Why are you talking to her all the time?

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.160
Chitara, you can't be jealous and sleep with Banthro.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:42.660
Zip.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.440
You talked about this.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.200
I'm going to show you a couple more zips.

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.480
My god, Chitara.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.240
Your body is incredible.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:57.240
Oh my god, you're not even a cat person.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.240
It's mumra, it's mumra.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.240
Mumra.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:07.240
Well, if it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:11.240
Thunder, thunder, thunder.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.240
Oh shit, he stopped with the thunder process.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.240
No one ever thought to do that.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.240
God damn it.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.240
Fuck, he stopped me before.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.240
Before I could make my sword all the way.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.240
God damn it, he put ice in my hands.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.240
Mumra.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.240
Don't you like it?

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.240
Don't you like it?

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.240
Don't you like it?

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.240
You liked it that one time.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.240
Mumra.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.240
Gross.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.240
Where are we on this planet?

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.240
I don't know.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:44.240
I'm so, I'm so tired.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.240
Yeah.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.240
All the time.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.240
All the time.

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:52.240
Mumra, how come you have to be two people?

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.240
How come you have to change from a mummy man into a...

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.240
That's a good question.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.240
That's a good question.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.240
You want to know?

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.240
Yeah.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240
You want to know?

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.240
Here.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.240
Okay, you want to know?

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.240
You want to know?

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:13.240
Okay, so there's good energy and then there's bad energy.

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.240
Right.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.240
And then there's in between.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.240
So when you're a mummy, you're good?

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:24.240
Well, good is defined by what we think is good and what is bad, correct?

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.240
Well, I'm just a cat.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.240
Well, yes, but you have an opinion of what is good, right?

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:35.240
I believe that the thunder energy is the only good energy in the world, reverse.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.240
And I, in 2018, do not.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.240
What?

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.240
Mumra.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.240
Right.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:47.240
So I'm good when I'm old mummy guy, right?

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:55.240
But when I want to be bad and kick some ass, I turn into a super mumra.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:01.240
And that's when I take my sword of omens and pray to the Lord of light to give me sight

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:07.240
beyond sight and then say thunder several times and assemble the thunder cats.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.240
Why, why don't you just have the sword always long?

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.240
That's the real question.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:20.240
Swords are for fighting and I believe in peace.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:25.240
That's why my hope is that I'll never have to have sight beyond sight ever again.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.240
How long does it take you to grow the sword long?

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.240
Well, let me run through it in my head.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:38.240
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder cats.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.240
About that long.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.240
And then there's the light that goes out into space.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:42.240
And then all of them come.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.240
Turns into the bat signal.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.240
They come out.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.240
Everybody runs to there.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.240
Okay.

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.240
And the animation is done on the ones as they come.

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.240
Right.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.240
A minute long of animation.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.240
Yes, it's a solid.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:58.240
And once a week, I turn into a strong mumra.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.240
Another minute.

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.240
Right.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.240
And then there's credits, which is two minutes.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.240
Yes.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.240
And then there's end credits, which is another full minute.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.240
Yes.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:12.240
So that's like five minutes we don't have to deal with.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.240
The rest is the shitty stuff.

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.240
Right.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.240
Well, Snarf made some soup the other day.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.240
Right.

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.240
And the panthro thought was too spicy.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.240
Right.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.240
Right.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.240
And that's all.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.240
What do you mean panthro?

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.240
Snarf, let's be honest.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.240
You're here for the three year olds.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.240
I think it's a reach.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.240
We have to eat something.

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.240
The families have to eat their children by leaving them

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.240
in front of the television.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.240
You're getting pretty dark.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:43.240
Snarf makes me uncomfortable as mumra.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.240
Why?

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.240
And I'm a living dead.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240
Why?

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.240
You're a nice guy.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.240
I'm just trying to make soup.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.240
But you talk English.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.240
Yes.

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.240
But you walk on all fours.

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.240
Well, sometimes.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.240
You have like a personal relationship with all these people.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:03.240
Do you ever try to protect me from this emotional abuse?

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.240
Snarf, this is a bed you made a long time ago.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.240
You don't wear pants.

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.240
You can't drive a car.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.240
What do you wear?

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.240
Mummy?

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.240
Bandages.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.240
Right.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:18.240
Because I'm one person all the time.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.240
You walk on all fours.

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.240
You have to go into a second identity to prove who you are.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.240
Does he shit in the bathroom?

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.240
Or does he just like shit in front of you?

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.240
Like a dog.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.240
I'll take a shit right in front of you.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.240
Snarf, stop.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.240
What?

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.240
Lionel, should I not take a shit?

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.240
Don't take a shit.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.240
Put some pants on.

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.240
Stand on your own two legs and learn how to drive.

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.240
He's basically cringer, but he never turns into battle cat.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.240
That's what his thing is.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.240
Well, he says his name a lot too.

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.240
Snarf.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.240
He's derivative.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.240
He should be called derivative.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.240
What?

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.240
Lionel?

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.240
But Snarf.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.240
My friend?

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.240
No, I'm your host and you're a parasite.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.240
Oh, fuck you.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.240
Well, you know what?

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240
Fuck me.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.240
Fuck you.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.240
Snarf.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.240
Snarf.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.240
Snarf.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.240
Snarvy.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.240
Oh, fuck.

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.240
Oh, shit.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.240
Now we can stand.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240
Oh, God.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240
Now we can walk around.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.240
Now we can have a relationship.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.240
I'm normalized Snarf.

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.240
Oh, yeah.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.240
Well.

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.240
We just saved ourselves six minutes of animation.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.240
Jesus Christ.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.240
You seem like a normal guy.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.240
Yeah, I was happy.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.240
We're all normal.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.240
Everybody's fine.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.240
Stopping bullies.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:38.240
I think if I taught anybody anything as Snarf, it's don't bully anybody.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.240
You guys are, you live in a bully culture.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:46.240
But if you have to teach us it by being high maintenance and taking up that much real estate,

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.240
is the lesson even worth it?

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:51.240
I mean, maybe it's a self-generated job guarding against bullying.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:58.240
But to be honest, I spent 30 seconds being non-Snarf, like being a self-activated Snarf.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.240
I want to go back to being regular flawed Snarf.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.240
More comfortable, is it, to complain about everyone bullying you?

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:05.240
Yeah.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.240
That's not a bad idea.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.240
Snarf, like, having a transformation sequence where he's not like this quadruped walking

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.240
around, probably humping shit.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.240
He just turns into a guy.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.240
He just stands around too late because you need me to pick up these dishes here.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.240
I can do it now.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.240
Yeah, but I'm going to go back to being regular Snarf because I find it more comfortable.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.240
Nobody in He-Man.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.240
I mean, forget about the fact that Prince Adam looked exactly like He-Man.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.240
I haven't.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.240
He had a green cat that then, and then He-Man also had a green cat.

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.240
It was just rubbing people's faces.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:38.240
But Battlecat didn't do shit, and Cringer had a personality.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240
Battlecat just had a helmet on.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.240
That wasn't the, I don't, sure.

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.240
Right?

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.240
It didn't make him less recognizable.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.240
Ah, He-Man.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.240
I gotta assume there's a hardwick podcast that's covered all of this.

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.240
Hey, He-Man.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.240
Peter Laurie is back.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.240
Hey, it's me, Rick.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.240
It's me, Peter Laurie.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.240
Hey, He-Man.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.240
He-Man, huh?

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:05.240
Did you watch that thing on Netflix, the toys that made us in the 80s?

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.240
No, no, no.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:13.240
They did this whole creation of He-Man and how the guy who created He-Man the toy was

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.240
just talking shit about the cartoon.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.240
Like, he goes, he's all buff.

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.240
Prince Adam's all buff.

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.240
He's, like, all ripped, but he's a wimp.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:24.240
That doesn't make any goddamn sense.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.240
So, what came first, the toy or the cartoon?

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.240
The toy.

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.240
Oh.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.240
Look, they, the people, I forgot who it was.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.240
It was Mattel.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.240
I think.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.240
What?

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.240
Was it?

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.240
Oh.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:44.240
Well, Hasbro has He-Man now, but I think Mattel had He-Man, but they had a chance to get

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.240
Star Wars.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.240
They went, nah, that movie's not going to go anywhere.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.240
And then, Kenner got it.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.240
And then, they went, shit.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.240
And then, G.I. Joe came around, and they went, fuck.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:00.240
And then, they said, well, why don't we create something, why don't we create a property

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.240
before the movie?

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:08.240
And they created He-Man, and, and He-Man is just like, they looked at G.I. Joe, and they

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:11.240
looked at, like, Luke Skywalker, and they go, look at these guys.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.240
They're not posed.

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.240
They have blank expressions.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.240
They're really small.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.240
Let's make them really buff and give them, like, expression, and, and, like, you know,

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.240
like, make them a bigger toy.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.240
And, and then, during, like, the pitch meeting, when they were going to, like, Toys R Us,

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:30.240
they, they said, yeah, well, is there, how are kids going to know about this?

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.240
And they go, oh, well, they're going to watch the cartoon.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:37.240
And they went, oh, okay, well, then we'll, we'll, we'll buy a bunch of this stuff.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.240
This sounds great.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.240
And then, they left the room and said, well, what do you mean cartoon?

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.240
And they go, well, we'll have to make some phone calls.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.240
All right, Rob, if you could make a movie or a TV show, and there was an action figure

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.240
that kids played with, what would the action figure be?

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.240
What?

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.240
Like, make up a new one?

01:15:54.240 --> 01:16:01.240
If you created a show that is something, like, an idea that you've already had, because

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.240
you got lots of great ideas, or a new one.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:09.240
But if you found out when you were an old man on your death bed and kids all loved,

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.240
there was one action figure, what would the action figure be?

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.240
Something that's already present?

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.240
Like, something that you created.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.240
Well, probably Skud.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.240
I mean, like Skud.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.240
Oh, Skud.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.240
Yeah.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.240
That would be cool.

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.240
Yeah.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.240
Well, Skud, Skud had an action figure, but that was a disaster.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.240
We hit, we hit peak toy with micronauts.

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:32.240
My brother had micronauts, and like, they were, they were the best toy ever.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.240
They were really fun.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.240
They were all swallowable pieces.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.240
Everything, that was the gimmick.

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.240
Everything was swallowable.

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.240
Like.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.240
They had little fists that could come off that were like pill size.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.240
Everything was pill size.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.240
Everything was removable.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.240
They're heads.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.240
Yeah, everything good.

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.240
You could just, it was just the size of a baby's epiglottis.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.240
No bigger, no smaller.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.240
Yeah.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.240
What was the guy that talked fast?

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.240
Micromachines.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.240
That was micromachines.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.240
Micromachines.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.240
We got, did you have this micronauts toy?

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240
This is a deep cut.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.240
This is deeper than, this is like.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.240
My brother might have had it.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:09.240
It was a giant hornet with like purple transparent wings.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.240
It was a spaceship.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:13.240
I think, and then you could hold all your micronauts in it.

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.240
I don't know.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.240
I don't know.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.240
It was like wasptron or something like that or whatever.

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.240
But it had like this.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.240
It was all black.

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.240
Had like a pointed face with like red windows.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.240
You could open it up.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.240
That was the cockpit.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:32.240
You put your micronaut in it and then had like these laser purple wings that you could

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.240
make flap or whatever.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.240
And it was like the coolest thing ever.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:41.240
And Jeff Schrab got that for Christmas because he always got the cool shit.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:47.240
And I got clothes, the vegetable soup of gifts.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.240
Yeah.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.240
Yeah.

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.240
But those clothes today.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.240
Look at me.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.240
Yeah.

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.240
Yeah.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:58.240
Micronauts were cooked because they were just so, they were tiny.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.240
And but the every fucking joint was articulated.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.240
They were metal too.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.240
They had like their heads were like metal.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.240
Yeah.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.240
What was your favorite toy growing up?

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.240
Like the one toy that you could rely on?

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240
I don't know.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.240
When you're talking about micronauts, they remind me of Z-bots, which seem kind of similar.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:19.240
They're like a collectible figure that's pretty small.

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.240
But yeah, I don't know.

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.240
I like connects.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.240
For me, it was Legos and Star Wars action figures.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.240
Yeah.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.240
Like Legos is the best.

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.240
And then you get, you have to go pee in the middle of the night and you step in a Lego

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.240
and you just die because it hurts.

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.240
Stephen got a fucking At-At Walker.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:38.240
What?

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.240
And I got a fucking sweater.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.240
I feel like that's because probably.

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.240
What the fuck is this?

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.240
I told you the Kendall story, right?

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.240
I told you that.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.240
No, tell us again.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:59.240
I would play Barbies with the girls next door a lot.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.240
And you would win.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:06.240
I would win when they would leave the room and I would pull my dick out and rub them

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.240
all over the Barbies.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.240
Wait, how jokie is that joke?

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.240
How jokie?

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.240
It's not a joke.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.240
You would rub your dick on the Barbies?

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.240
And I would kiss them.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.240
And you rub your dick on them?

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.240
Yeah.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.240
On the Barbies?

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.240
Yeah.

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:23.240
Okay.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.240
I was 21.

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.240
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:31.240
Now, I was so in love with Barbies.

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:37.240
I would just kiss them and rub them on my face and everywhere and take off their clothes.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.240
And it was just so fascinating.

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.240
Well, you didn't have sisters.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.240
I had a sister, but she was institutionalized.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.240
She didn't have Barbies.

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.240
And so there's deprivation.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:53.240
If you're not raised around a sister, you're encountering femininity for the first time

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.240
through girls' toys.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.240
Right.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:04.240
You go to the girl across the street or you're getting play dates or whatever.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:11.240
This girl's got these girl toys and the girl toys are girls with hair and skirts.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:18.240
You're maybe seven years old, but you're still a little barbarian.

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.240
Yeah, I was snarf-humping on these toys.

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:31.240
And I guess I played with Barbies enough that my parents told my grandma,

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:36.240
well, what does Stephen...

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.240
Robby.

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.240
What does Jeff...

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.240
Robby.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.240
Robby.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.240
What does Robby want for Christmas?

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:47.240
And they told him the Barbie story and so they don't give him a Barbie.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.240
And they gave me a...

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.240
Because then they don't want a gay son.

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.240
Right.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.240
So they gave me a Kindle.

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.240
So I opened it up.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:58.240
Stephen gets like fucking Ewoks and Mumras and shit.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:02.240
And I'm like sitting there and I open it up and I get a Kindle.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:07.240
And I looked at it and all this went like flash through my head.

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:10.240
And I was like, oh my God, they think I'm gay.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.240
And this is a way to stop it.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.240
And it's totally ineffective.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.240
This is making me way gayer.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.240
Yeah.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.240
And then I start full on...

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.240
They put the pedal to the metal.

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.240
This guy is a beefcake.

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.240
Yes.

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.240
And then I pull on, not cry, cry.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.240
And I'm going, grandma, I didn't want this.

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:37.240
I want this stomping my foot way too old to be that like fucking...

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.240
Part of it is...

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.240
Cartman level crying.

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:44.240
Part of it is it's a disappointing gift, but most of it is the humiliation.

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.240
It was me screaming to the world, no, you don't understand.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.240
I wanted to tell him, no.

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.240
I'm straight as an arrow.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.240
That's why I love those Barbie dolls.

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.240
I'm too straight.

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:58.240
I'm dangerously straight.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.240
Yes.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.240
I put my dick on a Barbie.

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.240
I like the idea that your parents thought...

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:06.240
And my dad beat the shit out of me.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.240
That was the worst thing.

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:16.240
Like he beat me to death and then stuck my face in the corner and made me stay there forever

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:21.240
because I was like, no, I don't want this.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.240
I don't want it.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.240
You got the wrong idea.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.240
I was molesting those dolls.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.240
But if he had opened up the Kendo and go, oh, hooray.

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.240
But he would like that too.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.240
That's the part that I'm fascinated by.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:39.240
Is that they were sort of like, I like the nuance with which this Midwestern family is

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:43.240
kind of like, he spends an awful lot of time with those girl toys.

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:50.240
Isn't there a masculine aspect to them that we could use to bring them back into the roller derby?

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.240
Oh my God, I was like so upset.

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.240
I walked into my son rubbing his dick on a female doll.

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:59.240
Let's give him a male doll to rub his dick on.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.240
They didn't know he was rubbing his dick on.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:07.240
They thought he was interested in playing with the female dolls.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:12.240
They didn't know he was properly objectifying women at an early age.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.240
And that there was nothing to worry about.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.240
Meanwhile, Steve is getting the Death Star.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.240
You have to fucking add that with the fucking everything.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.240
You can fly out the bottom of the add-at.

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:26.240
But isn't part of this, Rob, because I grew up, I've died an older brother,

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:33.240
and a big tradition in the Midwest in our generation was that Christmas would come,

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:37.240
and they'd just take the Sears catalog and plop it in front of you.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:41.240
Oh, they stopped doing that after you discovered the bra section.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.240
Right.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:49.240
I mean, or the Toys R Us catalog, it would be like, oh, Santa wants to know what you want.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:53.240
And then you'd have to go through the book.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:59.240
And there's all these kick-ass toys, but you'd point at them and go, I want that.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.240
And their parents would go, well, no, Santa can't afford that.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.240
You fucking idiot.

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:10.240
And then you'd settle on a thing that was, I assume, around $30 in Carter era.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:15.240
Like, whatever Optimus Prime was worth in 1988.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.240
I didn't get that.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.240
I didn't get Optimus Prime.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.240
But I'm just saying, like, that process, though, I'm saying I would end up.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.240
Got a fucking Kindle.

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:28.240
And it was one where you could put, like, you could give him a sideburn.

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.240
Or a beard, or whatever.

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:31.240
And he's got a suit and tie.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.240
And maybe you could dress up and comb your hair every once in a while, Robbie.

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:42.240
And it's like, Steven's, like, in the 25th century, Jeff is building stuff out of Apollo Lego.

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.240
And I just get the clothes and the fucking shit.

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.240
There's, yeah.

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.240
Well, it's good.

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.240
This is good.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.240
I like this.

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.240
Yeah, everything bad happening to you is actually good.

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.240
Why?

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.240
Because Dan says so.

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.240
No, I'm saying it's good to see he's alive.

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:05.240
And so he's got to, he's, you know, you're a fear of being angry.

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:09.240
You're a fear of being just a barbaric.

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:11.240
Yeah, they might be part of it.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240
Like, we want to be good guys.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.240
We want to be gentle and evolved and...

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.240
Smurf is a hard game.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.240
I just was watching a YouTube video of it.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.240
And man, you know what's after that first screen?

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.240
A second screen with the second fence.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.240
It's like the same exact place.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:27.240
Fence is a little higher.

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.240
No, it's not even.

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.240
And then, and then it's a two screens of nothing.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.240
And then a screen where you have to jump over a little crab grass in the exact same spot as those fences.

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.240
Do you have the video?

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:44.240
Do you have the videos that play the song that you would hear over and over and over again until you went crazy?

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.240
Scream crying.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.240
Scream.

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.240
I did a lot of scream crying when I was a kid.

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.240
No wonder.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.240
At least you had a calico, you know?

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.240
Well, we had a calico Adam.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.240
My family had an odyssey.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:03.240
Because that's how you roll when your dad's a baker.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.240
Fucking bakers.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.240
I thought someone was beatboxing.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.240
See, hear that?

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.240
That's hitting the fence.

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.240
Yeah, you hit the fence and then it just all stops.

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:27.240
And then all happiness stops.

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.240
And then you do that three times.

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:29.240
What was the Smurfs?

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.240
What was the Smurfs?

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:33.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.240
That was the theme.

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:40.240
We are the Smurfs and we were made with no joy.

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.240
The only Smurf for you is one who is true blue.

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.240
That Smurf is me.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.240
My name is hefty.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.240
Gargamel wanted to eat the Smurfs.

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.240
No, he wanted to turn them into gold.

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.240
Oh, Smurfs.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.240
How is he going to do that?

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:59.240
How many apples high was a Smurf?

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.240
Three.

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.240
Okay.

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:05.240
All right, let's play some fucking D and motherfucking D.

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.240
Which is actually terrifying.

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.240
Something three apples high is terrifying to me.

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.240
That's too high.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.240
They don't look that big.

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:14.240
Yeah, how big are the motherfucking mushrooms?

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:17.240
They got windows and shit in there and a chimney, motherfucker.

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.240
Motherfucker, three apples high and they go through that door.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.240
That means the mushrooms up to my hip.

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.240
All right, at least.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.240
Let's let's say playing with y'all.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:30.240
Let's save that for our other podcast called Smurf grief.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:33.240
Urban cartoon architect.

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.240
I love you.

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.240
Three apples.

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.240
How big are your apples?

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.240
Rob, were you here last week?

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.240
No.

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.240
Hip to the jive?

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.240
No.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.240
Do you want to play Rob?

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.240
I know you hate games.

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.240
We're pretty sure he's excited.

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:48.240
No, I don't.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.240
You're about to waylay a guy that's currently pooping, right?

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:53.240
Right.

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.240
I feel like every time I play, I do it wrong.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.240
It's fine.

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.240
You'll probably be OK.

01:27:58.240 --> 01:27:59.240
That's it.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.240
Break it down.

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.240
Last time on Harmon Time.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:11.240
Our heroes were in Dornester on the quest for Patchen's gem.

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.240
After some initial fact finding,

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:17.240
they discovered enough to realize that they should head to the theater

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.240
and find some clues.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.240
There, they met a guy named Gretel, who was fat

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.240
and asked him some questions.

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.240
And he pointed them all into the direction of Shrove,

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.240
a figure about town.

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.240
And so, on the pursuit for Shrove, our heroes left

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:38.240
and went to the tavern, but not before discussing

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.240
what they thought was the situation at hand,

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:45.240
which I wish I could quote directly, but I cannot.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.240
Then they went to the tavern where they met Cool Dennis

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:53.240
and learned some information where they met this dude

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.240
and he had a cloak and it turned out it was Patchen's cloak

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.240
from when he got robbed that first time

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:02.240
when it set off the quest of Patchen's gem in the first place.

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.240
And the guy who was wearing that cloak,

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.240
he said the guy who gave him the cloak was Shrove

01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:09.240
and he was in the bathroom or something like that.

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.240
And then the gang set up in the bathroom,

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:16.240
making sure to send diarrhea to the window to guard for an escape.

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.240
Surrounding Shrove in the bathroom,

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.240
our heroes were about to leap into action

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.240
to hopefully get to the bottom of the quest for Patchen's gem.

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.240
But will they?

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.240
So I'm standing by the window.

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.240
You're outside this tavern.

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:37.240
Right.

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.240
Because there's a guy in the bathroom of the tavern

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:42.240
that's like our perp.

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:43.240
He's a guy we want.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.240
I'm playing it cool.

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.240
I sent you out in case there's a window to the bathroom

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.240
because I don't want this guy leaving.

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.240
I'm playing it cool.

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.240
You're playing it cool.

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.240
I'm playing it cool.

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.240
You're outside the window.

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:55.240
I'm ready to cast flair to dazzle him when he comes out

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.240
so that you can waylay him, Carlos.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.240
Do I see Jeff?

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.240
No, you're outside.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.240
No, because you're outside.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:05.240
Carlos and I are around the bathroom door.

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:07.240
You're outside around the window, right?

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:09.240
It's kind of like the drawing room or wherever.

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.240
So like the back of the bathroom is like way far away.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.240
So I'm just hanging out.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.240
I'm just playing it cool.

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:17.240
Yeah, you're just trying to see if anyone climbs out.

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.240
Yeah, you're playing it cool.

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:20.240
I'm playing it cool.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.240
I'd say you're playing it cool.

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.240
Outside the window of the bathroom.

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:25.240
So Carlos, let's make sure we got our shit together.

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.240
When Shrove comes out of here from poop

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:30.240
and we know that this guy is involved

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.240
with the waylaying of Patchen's,

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:37.240
he probably has the gem.

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:40.240
I'm ready to cast flair to dazzle him.

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:43.240
Or should we figure this out?

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:44.240
What's the best way to know about this?

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:47.240
Well, yeah, we need to plan post-apprehension

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.240
because we're not taking him to the Church of Silver Flame.

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.240
No, we're taking him down.

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:53.240
We're taking him to 21 Fuck You Street.

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.240
Well, we're taking him God knows where.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:00.240
But yeah, we gotta not cause a civic incident.

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:03.240
People see us mugging this guy.

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:06.240
All right, so maybe we just knock him unconscious.

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:11.240
I can do shaleily and cudgel this guy and knock him out.

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:14.240
And then you're stronger than me.

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:15.240
You're bigger than me.

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:17.240
We can just take him.

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.240
Yeah, I just don't know where to take him.

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:26.240
But we just get him outside.

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.240
Is it nighttime?

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.240
Hey, cool, Dennis.

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.240
It's getting towards evening.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:30.240
Yeah.

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.240
Do you have rooms to rent here?

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:34.240
No, this is just kind of like a tavern.

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:37.240
It's not a tavern slash inn or whatever.

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:39.240
We don't get too many visitors.

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:41.240
What's your policy on people knocking out people

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:44.240
as they come out of a bathroom and dragging them out of the tavern?

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.240
I'd say it's directly against both the rules of this tavern

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:50.240
and the rules of House Galando,

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.240
which governs all sorts of places of hospitality in the nation.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.240
Oh, shit, that's bad for us.

01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.240
Is there any way to get a temporary permit

01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:01.240
if our interest is in not disrupting your house of hospitality

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.240
if I could give you some gold pieces just as a reprieve

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:08.240
because our goal is to just make this as painless as possible,

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.240
just want to get him out of here and take him somewhere else.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.240
He looks at you with a look and he says,

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:16.240
Sonny, I don't think you know the situation you are in.

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.240
Do you know who Shrove is, what he is to this town?

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.240
Do you know who you are to this town?

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.240
Well, I'm a stranger.

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.240
Right.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.240
Isn't Shrove's a master?

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.240
Shrove's a good friend.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.240
He's the master of the theater guild, right?

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:32.240
Yeah, the Gretel told you he was the theater master, I think.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.240
Well, do you know what the church is to this town?

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.240
A pain in my rump.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.240
Yeah, well, it can only get bigger.

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:42.240
I mean, Shrove's got himself into a real hot mess.

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.240
I don't want any trouble.

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.240
I don't want to win a popularity contest either.

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.240
I walk up to Carlos and go, Carlos with a wink,

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.240
like, hey, you know what? Let's just leave it.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:52.240
Let's, you know...

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.240
Okay, cool.

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:56.240
I guess we won't pay you anything, and we won't do anything.

01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:01.240
Yeah, message received, but we still go back to the bathroom

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.240
if I can get this mother...

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:05.240
And if things get tough, I'll just summon a giant ant

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.240
in the middle of your bar.

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.240
Exactly.

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:10.240
Shush, shushy, shushy pray.

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:12.240
Yeah, so you guys are just...

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:14.240
Do you want that?

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.240
You're outside.

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:18.240
You guys are just retaking your positions

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.240
that you were in formerly when it was clear

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.240
that you were going to...

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.240
I'm gonna go back outside.

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.240
After having said you are going to do that?

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:27.240
I'm gonna hold my crotch like pee-pee dance

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.240
and go, oh, you know what?

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:32.240
All this talk about things that made me want to go pee-pee dance.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.240
So I'm gonna go stand in line for the rest of my life.

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.240
All right, great. That makes sense.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:39.240
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna fucking do.

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:41.240
I'll be ready with Shalely

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.240
so I can cudgel this motherfucker in my quarter-staff

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:47.240
because of plus one weapon with 2D6 damage.

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:48.240
Damn.

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.240
Yeah.

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.240
So I'm fake pee-pee dancing

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.240
out in front of the men's room.

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:58.240
I'm into it.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.240
Okay.

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:00.240
God, I don't...

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.240
Hey, what are we gonna do, man?

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.240
We're in over our heads.

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.240
We did it again.

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.240
We're in over our heads.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.240
We're in over our heads?

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.240
Nothing. You're outside. You can't hear me.

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.240
I'm talking to myself.

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:11.240
I'm right next to you.

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:13.240
I'm ready to fucking rock.

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.240
This guy's gotta come out.

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:15.240
He's just been pooping.

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.240
We're gonna fucking get this motherfucker.

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:20.240
I'm outside. Maybe we should just follow him.

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.240
Yeah.

01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.240
No.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.240
I'm gonna go in.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.240
What?

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.240
Follow him?

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.240
He's gonna sneak out.

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:27.240
We're gonna lose him.

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:28.240
Like, we always...

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.240
I started tapping on the window.

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:32.240
We spent the last 45 minutes

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.240
waiting for this guy to get off the goddamn pot.

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.240
And I'll tell you what I'm not gonna do.

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.240
Oh.

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.240
He's knocking on the window.

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.240
Hey.

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.240
Oh, shit.

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.240
Hey, come on.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.240
Well, we're not aware of that.

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:47.240
That's Shrove.

01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:49.240
Well, let's...

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:50.240
Yeah, you're not aware of that.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.240
Psst.

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:52.240
Okay.

01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.240
Poop awareness.

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:54.240
Hey.

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:55.240
Shrove.

01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:56.240
Shrove.

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.240
Yeah.

01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.240
No.

01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.240
You're doing that.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:00.240
Yeah, you're doing that.

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.240
It's alarming.

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.240
Hey!

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.240
No one's responding, though.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.240
All right.

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.240
We wait.

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.240
How long have we been waiting?

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:08.240
And how long is this poop?

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:10.240
Let's say you've been waiting about five minutes.

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:11.240
Okay.

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:12.240
It's a standard poop.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:13.240
I'm gonna wait this motherfucker out.

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.240
It's...

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.240
Well, at least it's fucking...

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.240
It's ready to go.

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:19.240
All right.

01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:20.240
So I was knocking pretty hard.

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.240
Oh, yeah.

01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:22.240
Did you...

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:25.240
Did you add that into the role?

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.240
Yeah.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.240
And you're one of the strongest people here, I think.

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.240
Yeah.

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:32.240
And the wind...

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.240
And that didn't do anything.

01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.240
Well, it made noise, but he didn't respond.

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.240
I think he's dead.

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.240
Maybe he was scared.

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.240
I'm gonna open the window.

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.240
Okay.

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:42.240
Okay.

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:45.240
And then I stick like my elvish blade.

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:51.240
And then I stick like just the tip underneath the crack of the window.

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:55.240
And I use it as like a lever.

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:56.240
Yeah.

01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.240
To...

01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.240
Well, how would you do it?

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.240
No, this is right.

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:01.240
I'm not laughing at your methodology.

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:02.240
Okay.

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:03.240
Okay.

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.240
And then I start prying it.

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.240
Mm-hmm.

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.240
You know, and it probably...

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.240
It'll probably take a couple...

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.240
Because you know, when you do like the butter knife thing, it kind of...

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.240
It doesn't get under there right away.

01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.240
Right.

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:13.240
But I get, you know...

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.240
You get there.

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:15.240
Yeah.

01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:16.240
I kind of...

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.240
I go back and forth a little bit.

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.240
Yeah.

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.240
To get it underneath.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.240
Okay.

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.240
And then I...

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.240
And then I...

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.240
Are you rolling the dice?

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.240
Well, you're not done yet.

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:26.240
On the table.

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:27.240
What are you doing?

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.240
I don't need to see what you are gonna do.

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:29.240
What am I doing?

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.240
You open the window.

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:31.240
Yeah, it opens.

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.240
I open the window.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.240
Right.

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:34.240
I open the window.

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.240
Yeah.

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.240
Is there no dice?

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.240
No.

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:38.240
Okay.

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.240
Open the window.

01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.240
I go, hey, hey!

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.240
Open the corner, not near the toilet or anything.

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.240
He's just staring at you.

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.240
Blair Witch.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:49.240
Like he's been seeing you knocking on the window and then slowly working it open.

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:50.240
Right.

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.240
So he's just staring at you.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:53.240
He's like an older...

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:57.240
He's an older black guy wearing like kind of glasses.

01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.240
And he's got these big thick long dreads.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:03.240
And he wears like the clothes of a scholar.

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.240
And yeah, he looks...

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:09.240
He looks like he's seen crazier shit than this.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:12.240
And at the same time, he's like, what?

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:15.240
Why would anyone want to see what's in a bathroom?

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:17.240
That's kind of the look he's got.

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.240
Okay.

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.240
All right.

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.240
So, you know...

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.240
So you're looking at him.

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.240
He's looking at you.

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.240
Okay, I'm gonna just...

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.240
I stare back at him.

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.240
Uh-huh.

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:31.240
For how long?

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.240
Until he does something?

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.240
Until he does something.

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.240
All right.

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:38.240
Well, then after about 20 seconds of this, he starts slowly inching to the door.

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.240
Okay.

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.240
Yeah.

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.240
And I'm gonna keep...

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:46.240
And I'm gonna lock eyes with him and follow him like my sight.

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.240
With your eyes.

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:48.240
With my eyes.

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:49.240
Okay.

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:50.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.240
He slowly makes his way towards the door.

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.240
And I'm not making him do this with my mind, right?

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:57.240
No, you're definitely not making him do this with your mind.

01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:58.240
Okay, good.

01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.240
Yeah.

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.240
Okay.

01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.240
I mean, yeah.

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:02.240
It's intimidating.

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:04.240
It's intimidating, yeah.

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:09.240
He, he, he, he gropes through the door knob and he opens it and, um...

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.240
I cast Flare to dazzle him.

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:13.240
All right.

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:16.240
I'm gonna dazzle the fuck out of this guy.

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:17.240
Level zero spell.

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:19.240
What's, what's your wisdom score?

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:22.240
What's your wisdom score?

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:24.240
My wisdom is...

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.240
Sorry.

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.240
Wisdom.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.240
It doesn't matter.

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:31.240
He didn't roll high enough.

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:32.240
Sorry.

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:33.240
He gets dazzled?

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.240
Well, you said Flare, right?

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:37.240
I'm 19 wisdom.

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.240
Great.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.240
That's really good.

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.240
Does that affect just him?

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.240
Um...

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:43.240
The dazzle?

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.240
Yeah.

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.240
Yeah.

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.240
Would I get dazzled too?

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.240
I mean, I'm looking inside the bathroom.

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:50.240
Uh, well then, uh, yeah.

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:52.240
So, so I didn't dazzle him.

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.240
No, you dazzled him.

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.240
Um, how dazzled is he?

01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.240
Completely.

01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:04.240
I, I, I want to, I want to push then into the bathroom with the dazzled show.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.240
Okay.

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:06.240
Trying to do it.

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.240
I'm trying not to rate, you know, make it a big deal.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.240
It is.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.240
Casting magic's a big deal.

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.240
Like it's obvious, you know?

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:13.240
Okay, well...

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.240
It's like a big magical display.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:18.240
Well, I still, I'm gonna push my way into the, into the bathroom of show.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.240
All right.

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.240
You do that.

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:24.240
Um, you notice, I mean, everything happens so fast, you know, so to speak or whatever.

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.240
But you, you do notice that when this, when these events start unfolding, literally everyone

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.240
in the tatter and like leaps to their feet and starts moving towards you.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.240
But you're in the bathroom now.

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:33.240
Right.

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:35.240
Well, uh, Jeff, are you going to the bathroom too?

01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:38.240
Um, I'm standing in the bathroom doorway dazzling.

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.240
Right.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.240
But then Dan shoved everyone into the bathroom.

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.240
So...

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.240
Okay.

01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:49.240
Um, I stay in like the corridor leading in there and I pull out my chileli ready for

01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:50.240
action.

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:51.240
All right.

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.240
You can't do that because you've got to cast it as a spell first.

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:55.240
Well, should I just go in the bathroom?

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:58.240
You could do, you could do so many things, man.

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:02.240
Wait, so, but I can't do chileli because I'm already got a spell going.

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.240
Well, chileli is a spell.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:08.240
So you have to cast that before and you don't have enough actions currently to cast two spells

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:09.240
in a turn.

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:10.240
Um, I...

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:11.240
But he could get into the bathroom with us.

01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:12.240
Yeah.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.240
Yeah.

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.240
Move action.

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:17.240
If it's possible to do that, let's do it.

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:20.240
Is the window big enough for me to crawl inside?

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:21.240
Yeah.

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.240
That's an alternative pitch to that.

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:24.240
So I'm halfway.

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:25.240
Okay.

01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.240
Well, that, I think maybe this shouldn't be our destination.

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:30.240
I was thinking maybe we go out.

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:31.240
The window.

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.240
Okay.

01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:33.240
The window.

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.240
So, okay.

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:38.240
So I, so I go, I, so Spencer, look at me because this is a visual thing.

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:39.240
Okay.

01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:42.240
So I'm going to do the...

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.240
He's, he's, he's given a boost.

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:45.240
Yeah.

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:46.240
Just for them to come down.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.240
I'm out.

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.240
I'm out.

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.240
But first things first.

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:50.240
I'm outside the window.

01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:52.240
We've got this guy right now.

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:53.240
Yeah.

01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:54.240
More than we're ever going to have him.

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.240
I want the fucking gem.

01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:56.240
He's dazzled.

01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:57.240
Yeah.

01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.240
Exactly.

01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:59.240
Dazzled.

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:00.240
So I'm...

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:01.240
Hand him towards me.

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:02.240
I say Shrove.

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:04.240
Can you hear me?

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.240
Yeah, for sure.

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:12.240
We want Patchen's gem, which you may know as just the gem.

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.240
It's not yours.

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:17.240
Where is it?

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:19.240
Um, I don't know what you're talking about.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:21.240
Here come the pain.

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.240
Shrove.

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:24.240
I'm still doing this.

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.240
You're still boosting your...

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:31.240
Shrove, if I take you out of this bathroom without knowing anything about the gem, um,

01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:32.240
you're...

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:35.240
You're as good as dead.

01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:37.240
It's not going to go well for you.

01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.240
You're as good as dead.

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.240
This is your last chance.

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:40.240
Who are you people?

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.240
We're from the church.

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.240
Okay.

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.240
You don't need to know who we are.

01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:46.240
Nice.

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:53.240
We're from people that are better than you at taking gems and getting away with it.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.240
I want to...can I search him?

01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.240
Is there like a Frisk move?

01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:01.240
That's just like...he doesn't have the fucking...he's not going to have it.

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:04.240
But I just want to see what's like in his pockets.

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:06.240
Easy.

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:11.240
You moved to Frisk him, but his hand is like lightning and he shoots out and you didn't

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:14.240
even see he was holding a dagger, but he slices you.

01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:16.240
Damn it.

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:17.240
Fuck.

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.240
Now we're going to die.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.240
He slices you for five damage.

01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.240
God!

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.240
Fuck you.

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.240
Can I cast a spell?

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:25.240
Can I just do a regular action?

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.240
Is there soap in the bathroom?

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.240
You should wash that.

01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:28.240
Yeah, there is.

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:30.240
You should wash that out.

01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.240
Yeah, you could cast something.

01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:33.240
I think it's Dan's turn first.

01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.240
No, yeah, it is Dan's turn.

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:39.240
Well, you've been stabbed now in mid Frisk.

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:44.240
I'm going to reflexively, if someone's stabbing me, inflict moderate wounds.

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:47.240
All right, so do you see your touch attack?

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:49.240
It's on the other side.

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.240
It'll be kind of towards your attacks to the left, left.

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.240
Yeah, around there.

01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:55.240
Touch attack.

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.240
Touch 11.

01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:58.240
No, it's not that.

01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:59.240
Okay.

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.240
Unless he's flat-footed.

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.240
He's not.

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.240
But you grab him.

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.240
Wait, moderate wounds?

01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.240
How much damage is that?

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.240
It's inflict moderate wounds.

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.240
It's like three, right?

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.240
Two or three?

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.240
Sorry.

01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:15.240
Hold on.

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.240
Shit.

01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.240
Had it a second ago.

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:21.240
Do you want me to look?

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:25.240
Touch deals 2d8 plus 1 damage per level.

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:26.240
All right.

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.240
11.

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:29.240
All right, you hit him.

01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:33.240
Necrotic energy oozes through his body as he takes 11 damage.

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:38.240
Sorry, there's a verbal component to my spell.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.240
It's okay.

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.240
All right.

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.240
How close am I to him?

01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:46.240
You're maybe 10 feet, but you're kind of coming through the window.

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.240
Right?

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:49.240
Can I reach out and grab his shoulder?

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:51.240
Are you inside the bathroom at this point?

01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:52.240
Well, my arm could be.

01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.240
It's a hole.

01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:54.240
You can't reach through.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.240
You'd have to be in the bathroom to kind of reach him.

01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:03.240
My hand is in the bathroom.

01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.240
So no.

01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.240
Right.

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.240
You're not even going to roll.

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.240
No, you can't reach him.

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:14.240
You can move to him, and then you'd be able to reach him.

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.240
Move the window?

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.240
Move through the window.

01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:19.240
Well, I don't want to do that yet.

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.240
Are there any rocks?

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.240
Yeah, there's some rocks.

01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.240
Outside?

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.240
Yeah.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:25.240
I start throwing rocks.

01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:27.240
All right.

01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:29.240
You got a critical fail.

01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:30.240
Critical fail?

01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:31.240
Yeah.

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.240
You winged Jeff in the head with a rock.

01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:34.240
What?

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:36.240
I didn't mean to wing you.

01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:38.240
You hit him for five.

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:39.240
I hit him.

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:42.240
I take five damage, and he threw rocks through the window.

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.240
He was throwing rocks.

01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:44.240
What are you standing in the?

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.240
How big is this bathroom?

01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.240
It's not big.

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:47.240
Well, why did you?

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.240
You should have stood up.

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.240
You were just whipping rocks in the window.

01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:56.240
You hurt him as much as the guy that stabbed me hurt me.

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:58.240
I'm trying to help.

01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.240
I'm trying to help.

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.240
I'm trying to help.

01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:02.240
Can I do it?

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:04.240
You were the one that said, stay outside.

01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:11.240
Is there anything natural inside that I can use and tangle?

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:12.240
Not close enough.

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:13.240
It's too far away.

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.240
OK.

01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:21.240
It can't reach into the bathroom.

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:22.240
Shalely.

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:23.240
All right.

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:31.240
I turn my cord of staff into a Shalely and just fucking whack him right in the head.

01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:32.240
All right.

01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:35.240
You hit him for seven damage in the head.

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.240
This guy's got to die soon, right?

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:39.240
Not that soon.

01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:40.240
Is he OK?

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.240
What's his status?

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:49.240
He's doing fine considering he took two, I'm not going to say strong attacks, but pretty solid connections.

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.240
He's dazzled and dazed and confused.

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:59.240
I'm going to throw just one more rock, but I'm going to aim at his legs.

01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.240
Yeah.

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:01.240
Make it harder.

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:05.240
I get out of the way because I have been hurt before.

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:06.240
All right.

01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:07.240
Well, first is everyone else's turn.

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:16.240
So Shrove, he kind of ducks down into a ball like a crouch, and then dark energy emanates out from him and covers the bathroom in darkness.

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:23.240
Oh, that's just what normally happens in a bathroom.

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:25.240
Luckily, the window's open.

01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:28.240
Oh, the darkness is spilling out of the window.

01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.240
Darkness is spilling out.

01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.240
You can kind of dodge it.

01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:33.240
That hasn't happened since the Super Bowl.

01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:35.240
Hey, is it day out?

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:37.240
It's getting dark.

01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:39.240
Because of the window?

01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.240
No, no.

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:42.240
So he's cast darkness inside the bathroom?

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:44.240
Yeah, so you guys can't see so hot.

01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:47.240
And the darkness is leaking out of the window?

01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:51.240
Yeah, as if it were like a very bright room with light leaking out, but dark.

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:53.240
Wait, hold on.

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:58.240
The door gets smashed in, but you can't really see because it's dark.

01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:07.240
So a flash of light behind you kind of opens up, and you see a crush of people pressing in, but no one can really see so well.

01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:11.240
So just there's, you know, it's like a cartoon scuffle right now.

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:13.240
Someone in here.

01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:15.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:18.240
There's fists ablazing.

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.240
They're hitting you.

01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:21.240
They're hitting everyone.

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.240
Chef me, I'm outside.

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.240
I'm protected by the outside.

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.240
That's correct.

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:26.240
Thank you.

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:28.240
You keep throwing rocks at me.

01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:29.240
Just once.

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:32.240
Just once.

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:33.240
All right.

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.240
Only two connect.

01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:36.240
One hits Jeff and one hits Dan.

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.240
Who?

01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:38.240
I'm safe.

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.240
Who's Jeff?

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:41.240
XP.

01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:42.240
XP.

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:43.240
I get XP.

01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:44.240
Double.

01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:49.240
I picture this bathroom like the size of an airplane bathroom.

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.240
I'm picturing the size of like the rust against the metal.

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:55.240
Yeah.

01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:57.240
I want to get this guy out the window.

01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.240
Yeah.

01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.240
All right.

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:01.240
I reach my hand in.

01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:02.240
You do that.

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:03.240
Yeah.

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.240
And I say, throw them to me.

01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:05.240
Throw them.

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:06.240
You guys can't really see.

01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:08.240
How many hits do I take?

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:11.240
You took eight damage and Dan took four damage.

01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:14.240
So how does this dark work?

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.240
Okay.

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:16.240
Hard to see.

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:18.240
Think about the opposite of light.

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.240
Well, I mean, yeah.

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:21.240
Like negative light.

01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:22.240
Yeah.

01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:27.240
There's, it's getting, it's like day outside, right?

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:28.240
It's kind of getting dark.

01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:32.240
So if I light a match in this dark, it does nothing.

01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:33.240
You don't know.

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:35.240
You've never tried that.

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:37.240
I tried that.

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:38.240
You try it?

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:39.240
Yeah.

01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.240
It does nothing.

01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:42.240
It's too dark.

01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.240
It's magic.

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:44.240
You got to try these things.

01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:47.240
They didn't teach magic at art school?

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:48.240
Jesus.

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:49.240
No.

01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:50.240
Okay.

01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:53.240
I throw cards in there.

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:55.240
I think it's Dan's turn now.

01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:56.240
Okay.

01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:00.240
Well, I'm grabbing where I think Shrove is and I'm going to shove him toward the window

01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:04.240
because I'm like, we got to get this guy out of here.

01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:11.240
And I'm kind of hoping and shoving him that I'm like, I kind of want to be like a badass,

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:15.240
but I know I'm not like, like I want to like hit it.

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:19.240
Not only am I not avoiding hitting his head, like I kind of hope I do.

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:21.240
Like I want to Steven's a golem.

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:25.240
I know I can't, but I want to.

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:27.240
So you're grabbing him and you're doing what?

01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:28.240
You're pushing him somewhere?

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:34.240
Grabbing him and shoving him toward the window with the intent of getting him close enough

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:37.240
to the window that Diarrhea Jr. out there can start grabbing him.

01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:44.240
And like my long-term goal is get him out, like get him incapacitated and shoved out the window.

01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:46.240
Okay.

01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:47.240
Yeah.

01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:53.240
You grab someone that you feel like might be him and you start ushering towards the window

01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:56.240
and as you do that, you take some more punches.

01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:57.240
Great.

01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.240
Only two of them hit.

01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.240
So fun.

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:03.240
I don't like the sound of somebody.

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:05.240
You take five damage off of that.

01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:06.240
Damn it.

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:10.240
You get to the window though.

01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:11.240
So that's what?

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:12.240
14 for you?

01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:13.240
Yeah.

01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:18.240
Yeah, I'm close to death in a sense.

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:19.240
In a sense.

01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.240
I have like eight left.

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:22.240
That's not bad.

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:25.240
I mean, it's not great, but it's not bad.

01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.240
All right.

01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:27.240
You think he's to the window.

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.240
Yeah.

01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:33.240
Or you know you're to that window unless you got turned around somehow.

01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.240
Grab him, Diarrhea.

01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.240
I grab him.

01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:40.240
All right.

01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.240
You grab him.

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:44.240
And I can't see anything because I'm looking into the dark.

01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:45.240
Right.

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:46.240
Yeah.

01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:48.240
But behind me is daylight.

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:51.240
Dusk.

01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:53.240
He's so offended.

01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:54.240
It's not just daylight.

01:50:54.240 --> 01:51:01.240
He's been four years learning how light works at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.

01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:05.240
He's so mad at the idea of dark being able to.

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:06.240
It's not my idea.

01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:09.240
For four years, 80 years ago.

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.240
I know.

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:13.240
But you're like, let me get this straight.

01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:15.240
Like, yeah, it's magic.

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:16.240
Okay.

01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:17.240
All right.

01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:19.240
So I start yanking on whatever, whoever I'm holding on.

01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:20.240
You do that too.

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:25.240
When I'm pulling and yanking and yanking and pulling.

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.240
Yeah.

01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.240
Yeah.

01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.240
You do that.

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.240
You get him about halfway out.

01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:32.240
You don't get him full way out because you had bad footing or something like your back

01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:33.240
hurt or something like that.

01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:34.240
But you get him halfway out.

01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.240
And I'm aware enough to be shouting the whole time.

01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:38.240
I don't know if this is him.

01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:39.240
Who is it?

01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:40.240
Who is it?

01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:41.240
Because I don't want to.

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:42.240
That's probably a good call.

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.240
Yeah, it's your turn.

01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:50.240
I use my spell of light and I cast it on the ceiling.

01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:55.240
So the object, the ceiling can shine like a torch, right?

01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:57.240
Oh, just light, right?

01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:58.240
Uh-huh.

01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.240
I cast light on the ceiling of the bathroom.

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:06.240
You cast it and you see the faintest of light pulses, but it's almost immediately wiped out.

01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:09.240
It's not strong enough to pierce the magical darkness.

01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:10.240
Oh, fuck me.

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:11.240
God damn it.

01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:12.240
That's it.

01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:13.240
That's all.

01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:14.240
You can move.

01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:16.240
I just threw a poof.

01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:20.240
Well, at least in a meta sense, we now know you're not being shoved out a window.

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:21.240
Yeah, that's true.

01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:25.240
So did we catch anything in that moment, Spencer?

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.240
What did I?

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:30.240
You saw like a strobe-like flash of just a vicious melee.

01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:34.240
It seems like most of the tavern people are just punching each other, but they're kind

01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:35.240
of punching in all directions.

01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:37.240
So now the bathroom is just filled with people punching?

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:38.240
Oh, yeah.

01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:39.240
It's a madhouse.

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:42.240
You can't take two steps without catching a punch.

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:44.240
It's got the window.

01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:45.240
So that's my turn.

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:46.240
No, you can move.

01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:48.240
I jump out the fucking window.

01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.240
All right.

01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:50.240
You also get punched a couple of times.

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:51.240
Oh, you get punched.

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:53.240
I start grabbing and yanking him.

01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:54.240
Okay.

01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:57.240
How much d do I t?

01:52:57.240 --> 01:53:00.240
It just, they don't hurt that bad.

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:04.240
You take some, like their wrist isn't straight or something, like it doesn't connect.

01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:05.240
Sounds like that was our title.

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:08.240
How much d do I t?

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.240
Their wrist isn't straight.

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:11.240
I don't know.

01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:13.240
I think you're actually supposed to keep it bent or something.

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:14.240
Now that I said that.

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:18.240
Remember when you found out when you were a kid, you're not supposed to keep your thumb

01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:19.240
tucked in your hand?

01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:20.240
Oh, yeah.

01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:21.240
You punch somebody.

01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:22.240
So you break your thumb.

01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:25.240
God forbid I punch someone so hard I hurt myself.

01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:27.240
Like, what a problem.

01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:30.240
That's how you t d.

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:32.240
That is how you t d.

01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:36.240
I think I punched someone once.

01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:37.240
That's not true.

01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:38.240
I punched a lot of people.

01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:39.240
Damn.

01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:40.240
They were little kids too.

01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:41.240
What do you think about that?

01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.240
That's badass.

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:43.240
And this was last week.

01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:45.240
I punched a lot of fucking little kids.

01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:46.240
All right.

01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:47.240
So this is our turn.

01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:51.240
Or is it the NPC bad guy's turn?

01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.240
But it's Dan's turn.

01:53:53.240 --> 01:54:00.240
Dan, you're, you are kind of sandwiched between, you think is Shrove and Rob Schrab and Jeff is

01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:01.240
kind of in the mix there too.

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.240
We got to get Shrove out this window.

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:05.240
Right.

01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:06.240
Out of this melee.

01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:07.240
Yeah.

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:12.240
My goal, my long term goal is if that dude was Shrove, which I'm not questioning, I'm

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:17.240
just like, I grabbed that person shoving them like a package out the window.

01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:19.240
And my hope is to go out after them.

01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:22.240
Because I ain't going out through the bathroom door.

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:23.240
Yeah.

01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.240
So you do that.

01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:33.040
You push, you push the guy through and the window is now clear for access if you want

01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:34.040
to squeeze through.

01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:35.040
That's what I'm doing.

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.040
You do that.

01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:37.040
Easy access.

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.240
You take one more punch on the butt and you take six damage.

01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:40.240
Ow!

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.240
That's like, that brings me close to death.

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:43.240
Six butt damage.

01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:46.240
Someone punched me in the ass and might have killed me.

01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:48.240
I start laughing and pointing.

01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:51.240
I have, I have some heel spells and some good berries.

01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:53.240
The most lethal butt punch.

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:57.240
The punch of the butt caused more damage than when the guy stabbed me.

01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:58.240
And I'm.

01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:00.240
And when my friend threw a rock through the window.

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:05.240
I'm laughing, but I'm saying, it's not funny.

01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:07.240
I know it's not funny.

01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:08.240
I'm sorry.

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:09.240
It's not funny.

01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:10.240
You're right.

01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:11.240
It's not funny.

01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.240
I hope you don't die from getting punched in the butt.

01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:16.240
Ow!

01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:17.240
My ass!

01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:24.240
Hey, you got punched where the sun don't shine because it's dark in that bathroom because

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:27.240
he did his foul.

01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:32.240
I'm hanging out the window like crying blood because someone.

01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.240
I know it's terrible.

01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.240
I'm really sorry.

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:36.240
I take them by the hand.

01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:37.240
My balls are black.

01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:38.240
Helping them.

01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:43.240
I'm like one of those kids from that horrible orphanage.

01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:44.240
I'm not laughing at you.

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:46.240
I'm laughing at the situation.

01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:48.240
It's not your fault.

01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:50.240
God damn.

01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:56.240
How are we doing this for the church?

01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:57.240
Am I outside?

01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:01.240
No, it's your turn and you can be outside on your turn.

01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:02.240
I try to jump outside.

01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:03.240
All right, you do that.

01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:05.240
This window is like a Lily Tomlin.

01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:06.240
Can you see?

01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:08.240
Can you see outside?

01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:09.240
Can you see outside?

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.240
Now that you're clear of the window and it's not blasting out darkness.

01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:15.240
Do we have Shrove or do we not?

01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.240
You do.

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.240
Yeah, we got Shrove.

01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:18.240
Hell yeah.

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:19.240
So we got Shrove.

01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:20.240
We're all outside now.

01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:21.240
We should rough him up.

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.240
Yeah.

01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:23.240
No, we should beat the piss out of him.

01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:26.240
You should rough him up a bit and go, hey, you think that's funny?

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:28.240
You're making it dark in the bathroom?

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:29.240
No, we need to.

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:31.240
My friend got punched in the butt.

01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:33.240
Wait, is it my turn?

01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:36.240
You have an action, but you can't move.

01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:38.240
I can't do a spell.

01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:39.240
No, you can do a spell.

01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:46.240
I throw, I summon nature's ally and throw a bear into the bathroom.

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:49.240
So they have to deal with that.

01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:50.240
Nicely done.

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.240
Very good.

01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:52.240
That goes great.

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:54.240
I summon the bear.

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.240
Fantastic.

01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:56.240
And it's still dark in there.

01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:57.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:58.240
Okay.

01:56:58.240 --> 01:56:59.240
After he does that, I know it's not my turn.

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:05.240
I'm going to close the window.

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:12.240
So we get a full-on bear in the fucking bathroom and we're going to bone out with Shrove.

01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:14.240
And I'm covering Shrove like with my body.

01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:16.240
I'm just going to say I just don't want him to get away.

01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.240
Right.

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:18.240
Okay.

01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:20.240
So did I successfully cast a bear into the bathroom?

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:21.240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:22.240
It's tearing shit off.

01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:23.240
All right.

01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:25.240
There's a fucking guy out of here.

01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:27.240
The toilet keeps flushing.

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.240
These guys are going to be busy for a while with that bear.

01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:36.240
I heard him flushing in the toilet.

01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:37.240
Let's get Shrove.

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:38.240
This guy's a friend of the town.

01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:39.240
We're going to go somewhere.

01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:40.240
I know.

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:41.240
Let's take him up.

01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:42.240
We got to rough him up a bit.

01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:44.240
You know, I grab him by the arm and I start shaking him.

01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:45.240
We're going to get him out of here.

01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:46.240
We're in the street.

01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:47.240
What the fuck is?

01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:48.240
We got to get him out of here.

01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.240
We got to get you out of here.

01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:54.240
I look around to see if there's a place that we can hide ourselves.

01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:56.240
We got to hide you somewhere.

01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:58.240
We got to get you out of here.

01:57:58.240 --> 01:57:59.240
What are you doing back there?

01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:01.240
How long do you think a bear is going to last

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:03.240
with X amount of people in a bathroom?

01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:04.240
10 rounds.

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:05.240
How many rounds?

01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:07.240
10 rounds they'll never forget.

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:08.240
We got 10 rounds.

01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:09.240
We're fine.

01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:10.240
They're going to be giving bumper stickers

01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.240
for finishing the night in that place.

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:13.240
We can get him.

01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:14.240
Get this guy out of here.

01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:15.240
Out of here.

01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:16.240
Yeah.

01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:18.240
So you're behind the market.

01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:21.240
You're kind of between the back row of the market buildings

01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.240
and then the outer wall of the town.

01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:25.240
So it's kind of a natural alley.

01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:29.240
But it's also like it's in an area that's heavily populated.

01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:31.240
So unless like you get somewhere out of line of sight

01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.240
or something.

01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:36.240
What am I wearing?

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:38.240
Any kind of robe?

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:39.240
Is he wearing colorful clothes like me?

01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:40.240
Yeah.

01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:41.240
You're wearing colorful clothes.

01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:42.240
Like a robe.

01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:43.240
God, is it brilliant?

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:44.240
Yeah.

01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:45.240
No.

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:47.240
It's like a clown costume.

01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:48.240
OK.

01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:51.240
He's going to put his jacket over Shrove's head.

01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:52.240
Yeah.

01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:53.240
This is brilliant.

01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:55.240
In fact, also I got the robe.

01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:56.240
I got the Shrove robe.

01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.240
I bought the Shrove robe from the homeless guy.

01:58:58.240 --> 01:58:59.240
Right.

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:00.240
Yeah.

01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:01.240
Take that.

01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:02.240
Wrap his head in that.

01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:03.240
Shrove robe.

01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:05.240
The bloody Shrove robe.

01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:06.240
Whatever you want.

01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.240
Yeah.

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:08.240
Right.

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:09.240
Wrap his head.

01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.240
Like paparazzi avoidance style.

01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:11.240
I start shouting.

01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:13.240
Everybody out of the way.

01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:15.240
Ugliest man in the world.

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:16.240
You don't want to see this.

01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.240
He's so ugly.

01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:18.240
Don't.

01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:19.240
Everybody.

01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:20.240
We have a chance.

01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:23.240
I pat Shrove down to see what's on him.

01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:24.240
He's got a dagger.

01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:25.240
A dagger.

01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:26.240
I take the dagger.

01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:27.240
Take the dagger.

01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:28.240
He stabs it.

01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:29.240
What?

01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:30.240
I took the dagger.

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:32.240
No, you're reaching for it.

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:33.240
Oh.

01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:34.240
Yeah, he stabbed him.

01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:35.240
Fucking hell.

01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:37.240
I shake his other arm and I go, what are you doing?

01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:39.240
How many, how many of these do I tease?

01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:40.240
Five damage.

01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:41.240
Five people.

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:42.240
Five more, five more of these?

01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:43.240
Five more damage.

01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:44.240
Fucking hell.

01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:45.240
I shake him.

01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:46.240
I shake him.

01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.240
Why are you stabbing people?

01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:50.240
You pull it out of his hand after that, though.

01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:52.240
Because of the arm shaking.

01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:55.240
We need to incapacitate this guy.

01:59:55.240 --> 02:00:00.240
Why don't you punch him in the butt and almost kill him?

02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:05.240
He goes, what are you guys, what is this?

02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:07.240
You're not taking me alive.

02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:08.240
I'm going to kill you.

02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:12.240
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, dagger guy, long pooper.

02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:14.240
Do you have passions, Jim?

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.240
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:20.240
We're trying to find passions, Jim.

02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:23.240
That sounds like, is that a famous person?

02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:26.240
The Jim you prick, you fucking waylaid us on the highway,

02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:29.240
coming from a little, little knock.

02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:33.240
We're the fuck, my character would remember this stuff.

02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:36.240
Don't fucking lie to us.

02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:37.240
Yeah, don't waylaid us.

02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:39.240
I've been here for months.

02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:40.240
I'm like the town doctor.

02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:41.240
I don't, I don't leave.

02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:44.240
Like I have a lot of chronic patients and stuff.

02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:46.240
I'm not just going around hanging out.

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:47.240
Where did you get this robe?

02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.240
You piece of shit.

02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:50.240
I found it at the theater.

02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:52.240
You work at the theater.

02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.240
Right, yeah.

02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:55.240
And so I was like, well, this bloody robe seems too dirty

02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:57.240
to be with the other costume.

02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:59.240
I'm going to get rid of this.

02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:00.240
And there was a naked man.

02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:02.240
And hey, that works out great.

02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:05.240
You're a fucking idiot liar.

02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:07.240
Okay.

02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:10.240
I take his dagger, do I have his dagger?

02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:12.240
Yeah, I stab him back.

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:14.240
You stab him.

02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:15.240
Well, hey, huh?

02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:17.240
He's on the other foot.

02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:19.240
He takes five damage.

02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:20.240
Yeah.

02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:22.240
I still have the dagger.

02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:24.240
And I go, hey, I'll keep stabbing until you tell us

02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:25.240
where that gem is at.

02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:27.240
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:28.240
I stab him again.

02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:32.240
You start gabbing or we keep stabbing.

02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:34.240
All right, you deal five damage.

02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:37.240
Does anybody see us?

02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:40.240
Well, he's screaming out in pain and you haven't really

02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:43.240
made distance between you and the back of the tavern.

02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:44.240
What's this guy?

02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:46.240
We should really take him somewhere.

02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:48.240
Yeah, he's wounded.

02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:51.240
You see a group of people rounding the corner on one side.

02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:53.240
Okay, let's get the hell out of here.

02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:54.240
Nothing here to see.

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:56.240
Church of the Silver Flame.

02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:58.240
Church of the Silver Flame.

02:01:58.240 --> 02:01:59.240
Fuck you.

02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:00.240
You don't want to be next.

02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:01.240
Fuck all you.

02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:02.240
You want to be next.

02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:03.240
Keep fucking stabbing.

02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:04.240
You don't know him.

02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:06.240
You got robe over his face.

02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:08.240
Church of the Silver Flame, don't give a shit.

02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:10.240
We don't give a shit.

02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:11.240
There's a robe over his face.

02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:12.240
He's really ugly.

02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:14.240
You don't want to see this person.

02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:18.240
Just round a different, keep rounding corners.

02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:21.240
Just go find something more profitable to look at.

02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:23.240
Unless you want to get stabbed by a church.

02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:24.240
You don't want to see this.

02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:26.240
You forget a million things a day.

02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:27.240
Make this one of them.

02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:30.240
I hear there's an interesting dark bathroom

02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:32.240
with some animal life.

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:34.240
Can I cast a spell?

02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:36.240
Sure, yeah.

02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:42.240
I produce flame.

02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.240
And I just hold a flame in my hands.

02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:47.240
Yeah.

02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:49.240
Can I cast a flame in both hands?

02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:51.240
Or I just hold a flame in both hands?

02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:52.240
Like just hold flames?

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:55.240
Yeah, I think the produce flame lets you have a couple of flames.

02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:57.240
So I just stand there and go like...

02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:00.240
I just hold flames in both hands.

02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:03.240
Who wants to get burnt?

02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:05.240
How do you like your ribs?

02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:06.240
What?

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:08.240
How do you like your ribs?

02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:10.240
How do you like your ribs?

02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:11.240
Yeah.

02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:14.240
I look over at Carlos and go,

02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:16.240
how do you like your ribs?

02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:17.240
Yeah.

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:18.240
And they...

02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:19.240
No, you ask him.

02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:21.240
I ask the crowd.

02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:22.240
How do you like your ribs?

02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:23.240
No, you do.

02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:24.240
Okay.

02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:26.240
It doesn't matter.

02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:29.240
I have two flames.

02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:32.240
I look at the crowd of people around the crowd and go,

02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:33.240
how do you like your ribs?

02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:35.240
No, no, not them.

02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:36.240
It's too late.

02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:38.240
I don't care how they like their ribs.

02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:40.240
You say to the back, it's like saying,

02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:41.240
do you feel lucky, punk?

02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:43.240
You're saying to the person that you're going to burn.

02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:44.240
How do you like your ribs?

02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:46.240
There's a whole group of people coming around the corner now.

02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:47.240
Yeah.

02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:48.240
We don't want them...

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:50.240
We don't want to give them ribs.

02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:53.240
Okay, so why did you whisper that to me?

02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:55.240
It doesn't matter.

02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:56.240
It doesn't matter.

02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:00.240
I still take that advice and look at the crowd

02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:03.240
and it's the most confusing thing in the world.

02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:10.240
I'm now a gnome holding two fireballs in my hand.

02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:12.240
I look at this crowd of people.

02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:15.240
I go, how do you like your ribs?

02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:18.240
Cliff Hanger!

02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:20.240
All right.

02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:23.240
That's not the one.

02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:24.240
I did it.

02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:29.240
Rob Schrab, everybody.

02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:30.240
It feels better.

02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:31.240
It feels better.

02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:34.240
From Church, Nolan, Sarah, Chris, Zach, everybody here at

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:37.240
The Wonderful Starburns Industries Castle.

02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:40.240
Spencer Crittenden, editor-in-chief of Game Mastery.

02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:42.240
I'm Jeff Davis, a comptroller.

02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:44.240
I'm Dan Harmon.

02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:45.240
I'm your mayor.

02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:48.240
Drive fast, take chances.

02:04:48.240 --> 02:05:08.240
We got a guy off the toilet and now...

02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:10.240
Did you get any of that?

02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:21.240
It's a good show.

02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:24.240
Yo.

02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:26.240
Little prancing ponies.

02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:29.240
Little prancing gentlemen.

02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:31.240
Little prancing ponies.

02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:36.240
Bring them to the stable when they're road hard.

02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:40.240
Left dry, going in the field, eat the lollipop.

02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:44.240
Rainbows, little prancing ponies.

02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:49.240
MC Prancing Pony, here to tell you I'm a brony.

02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:52.240
Going to eat the cinnamon week.

02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:55.240
Ride with my pony feet up a rainbow ramp.

02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:57.240
Go to Rainbow Town.

02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:00.240
Meet another prancing pony in Brown.

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:02.240
And he'll say, what's up?

02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:04.240
He'll say, give me a rainbow cup.

02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:07.240
Give me a cup with rainbows in it.

02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:36.240
Fuck your mama, so I didn't win it.
