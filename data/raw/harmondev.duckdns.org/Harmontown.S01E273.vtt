{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:29.880\nIt's 8 o'clock Pacific Standard Time and you know what time that is.\n\n00:29.880 --> 00:35.640\nIt's Harmon Time, ladies and gentlemen from beautiful uptown Burbank.\n\n00:35.640 --> 00:39.640\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:39.640 --> 00:44.440\nPlease welcome to the stage your Game Master, extra denerra.\n\n00:44.440 --> 00:56.280\nSpencer Crittenden, you got a bag full of fun, a fun full of bag, and there's, do you, do\n\n00:56.280 --> 00:58.280\nyou beard get sexier?\n\n00:58.280 --> 01:14.040\nOh, let's hear it for your mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:14.040 --> 01:19.640\nPoop in your shoe, poop in your hat, poop on a ball, poop on a bat, poop on your head,\n\n01:19.640 --> 01:24.240\npoop in some bread, poop on your momma, now she's dead a bit, went to the La Brea Tower\n\n01:24.240 --> 01:29.160\npizza, took a poop, invited papers to get the scoop, but papers are dead and journalism\n\n01:29.160 --> 01:30.160\nis long gone.\n\n01:30.160 --> 01:33.720\nI fucked your momma so hard, the pussy's a front lawn, and then I mowed it, I made\n\n01:33.720 --> 01:38.400\nit clean, but it's not about shaving, it's not what I mean, it's not about objectifying\n\n01:38.400 --> 01:39.400\nthe vagina.\n\n01:39.400 --> 01:44.440\nI'm going to North Carolina with my beef dick and I'm making a canyon, I fucked your\n\n01:44.440 --> 01:51.400\nmomma and she said, damn son, fuck me more, so I did it, let's have some s'mores, chocolate,\n\n01:51.400 --> 01:59.360\ngraham crackers, little mellow, fucked your momma, she's yellow, I mean cowardly, I mean\n\n01:59.360 --> 02:00.360\ncowardly.\n\n02:00.360 --> 02:07.560\nAll right, thank you, the whole avenue of trouble I haven't gotten into yet.\n\n02:07.560 --> 02:13.400\nYou're going to have to apologize for that rap.\n\n02:13.400 --> 02:18.600\nThank you for joining us again in our no audience podcast.\n\n02:18.600 --> 02:27.040\nThere's some good signs on that front, I think Nolan's been making some progress and there\n\n02:27.040 --> 02:33.400\nwas some shifting in the power halls in the city of Burbank.\n\n02:33.400 --> 02:39.040\nI think there's a new guy who was in charge of Burbank now and he came through and he\n\n02:39.040 --> 02:45.760\nwas pretty friendly into the venue and he suggested, if you guys separate these desires\n\n02:45.760 --> 02:50.680\nof serving liquor here and doing a show here, you know, you could probably get an audience\n\n02:50.680 --> 02:56.680\nback in here a lot faster and you can still work on the license for the serving.\n\n02:56.680 --> 03:01.680\nSo I think if we do that, we could be looking at an audience version of the podcast again\n\n03:01.680 --> 03:02.680\nsoon.\n\n03:02.680 --> 03:04.480\nHow soon?\n\n03:04.480 --> 03:05.480\nNot soon.\n\n03:05.480 --> 03:08.800\nWhat a popular thing, probably not soon.\n\n03:08.800 --> 03:11.240\nNot very soon, I mean sooner, certainly.\n\n03:11.240 --> 03:15.160\nNot so soon that if that's what you're waiting for, you should prepare.\n\n03:15.160 --> 03:16.160\nYou should prepare.\n\n03:16.160 --> 03:17.160\nYeah.\n\n03:17.160 --> 03:20.080\nOr hang your hopes on it at all.\n\n03:20.080 --> 03:21.080\nYou should probably.\n\n03:21.080 --> 03:25.480\nHow do you feel about doing it with or without the audience?\n\n03:25.480 --> 03:27.360\nWhat's the difference for you over the last one?\n\n03:27.360 --> 03:29.960\nI think we all prefer it without an audience, right?\n\n03:29.960 --> 03:33.040\nIt's been so much easier and better.\n\n03:33.040 --> 03:38.520\nI think we've eaten our share of this, the lonely sandwich, I don't know.\n\n03:38.520 --> 03:41.680\nIt's six at one, whatever.\n\n03:41.680 --> 03:44.440\nWe haven't done it with an audience in a million years, so I'm looking forward to it.\n\n03:44.440 --> 03:49.160\nSpeaking of which, we're going to be at SketchFest in San Francisco in front of an audience.\n\n03:49.160 --> 03:52.400\nWe're not going to bring our lack of audience with us.\n\n03:52.400 --> 03:55.440\nThat's too expensive to fly, that much lack of audience.\n\n03:55.440 --> 03:58.000\nWe can't fly a lack of audience, I don't know.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:02.960\nSo we're going to go to an audience in San Francisco and do a little show there.\n\n04:02.960 --> 04:05.280\nI guess Google it, I don't know.\n\n04:05.280 --> 04:10.920\nYeah, Google SF SketchFest, Harmontown 2018 or something along those lines.\n\n04:10.920 --> 04:12.120\nYeah.\n\n04:12.120 --> 04:17.600\nI wanted to do our Belmont joke, but you don't even remember the radio.\n\n04:17.600 --> 04:18.600\nOh, it was a Belmont joke.\n\n04:18.600 --> 04:19.600\nYeah, yeah.\n\n04:19.600 --> 04:21.600\nYou said camera, I didn't understand what you were talking about.\n\n04:21.600 --> 04:22.600\nThat's all right.\n\n04:22.600 --> 04:24.600\nThat was part of the joke.\n\n04:24.600 --> 04:25.760\nYou have it written down, right?\n\n04:25.760 --> 04:27.600\nI have the bullet points.\n\n04:27.600 --> 04:32.000\nOkay, so why don't you set this up, or should I set it up?\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:38.680\nOkay, so we have this friend, she's a director, Sofia, Shmuka Muka Muka, it's a Swedish name.\n\n04:38.680 --> 04:41.600\nIt's not Shmuka Muka Muka, but yeah.\n\n04:41.600 --> 04:46.400\nI should have her last name because she, a long time ago I tweeted a music video that\n\n04:46.400 --> 04:48.480\nshe did right over here in this space.\n\n04:48.480 --> 04:50.640\nShe does stop motion stuff.\n\n04:50.640 --> 04:56.480\nShe's done a couple music videos at Star Burns now, very, very talented director.\n\n04:56.480 --> 04:59.960\nShe's from Sweden, she's here on some kind of visa or whatever.\n\n04:59.960 --> 05:05.120\nAnd maybe if you're a fan of Cody's Instagram, you've seen her teaching Cody how to say various\n\n05:05.120 --> 05:08.080\nfilthy things in Swedish.\n\n05:08.080 --> 05:13.640\nWhat I do have, Dan, is the Wikipedia, like, Belman joke.\n\n05:13.640 --> 05:17.800\nRight, so we were talking about jokes, like, somehow it came up, she said there's this\n\n05:17.800 --> 05:20.920\ntradition in Sweden that's called the Belman joke.\n\n05:20.920 --> 05:21.920\nSo is that where-\n\n05:21.920 --> 05:28.920\nBelman is like kind of the all-purpose character in a, like he's the butt of the joke, but he's\n\n05:28.920 --> 05:34.560\nalso kind of the hero of the joke in his own naivete stupidity.\n\n05:34.560 --> 05:38.520\nWe find ourselves culturally fascinated with it because we're Americans, so we have pollock\n\n05:38.520 --> 05:42.400\njokes, we have blonde jokes, we have all kinds of horrible jokes I can't even mention by\n\n05:42.400 --> 05:48.720\ncategory, but, like, we don't have, like, American jokes where we're cast as either\n\n05:48.720 --> 05:54.160\nthe wise guy in a ship of fools or the, there's some jokes where it's like you're trying to\n\n05:54.160 --> 06:00.960\npump yourself up like a redneck and a Yankee go into a place and the redneck just does\n\n06:00.960 --> 06:03.720\nthis and he's a simple working man and you're, like, yay.\n\n06:03.720 --> 06:09.120\nThe first paragraph in the Wikipedia for Belman joke is, the Belman joke is a type of simple\n\n06:09.120 --> 06:16.040\njoke popular among Swedish school children, always including a person named Belman as\n\n06:16.040 --> 06:17.280\nthe main character.\n\n06:17.280 --> 06:20.080\nAnd very often, do they have an example in there?\n\n06:20.080 --> 06:24.160\nYeah, very often it's like, you know how in America when you're a kid you learn these\n\n06:24.160 --> 06:29.880\njokes are like a black guy, a Chinese guy, and a Polish guy go into a popcorn store or\n\n06:29.880 --> 06:35.200\nwhatever and the Polish guy ends up doing something stupid or maybe it's the black guy\n\n06:35.200 --> 06:38.560\nthat does something that's more pragmatic or...\n\n06:38.560 --> 06:47.080\nBut in this case, there's two cultures and Belman who is a person and he stands apart.\n\n06:47.080 --> 06:50.880\nHe's either the villain or the hero, depending on your point of view.\n\n06:50.880 --> 06:55.720\nHe's kind of the, yeah, it's like, I think it's like a manifestation of Sweden as they're\n\n06:55.720 --> 07:00.720\nlike, well, what are we going to do, we probably don't have that big of an army, you know, like\n\n07:00.720 --> 07:02.600\nI don't, it's a national psyche thing.\n\n07:02.600 --> 07:06.880\nIt's like they'll go, oh, there's this guy, there's that guy, and then there's Belman.\n\n07:06.880 --> 07:08.400\nBelman is the Swedish guy.\n\n07:08.400 --> 07:09.600\nHe's just a regular Joe.\n\n07:09.600 --> 07:19.120\nSo Dan, a Dane, a Norwegian, and Belman made a wager on who could remain inside a goat\n\n07:19.120 --> 07:20.120\npen the longest.\n\n07:20.120 --> 07:21.120\nRight.\n\n07:21.120 --> 07:22.120\nOkay, classic Belman.\n\n07:22.120 --> 07:28.200\nThis is just, this is your run of the mill Belman joke.\n\n07:28.200 --> 07:35.600\nFirst out was the Dane who came out just after 10 minutes yelling, damn, that goat stinks.\n\n07:35.600 --> 07:37.440\nAfter him, the Norwegian went in.\n\n07:37.440 --> 07:42.440\nAfter half an hour, he came out yelling, damn, that goat stinks.\n\n07:42.440 --> 07:46.660\nFinally, Belman went in.\n\n07:46.660 --> 07:53.320\nAfter two hours, the goat came rushing out saying, damn, that Belman stinks.\n\n07:53.320 --> 07:54.320\nCan I rewrite that real quick?\n\n07:54.320 --> 08:00.000\nAfter 10 minutes, whatever it is, just say, they should just say the goat came out.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.560\nHe doesn't have to say, damn, that Belman stinks.\n\n08:02.560 --> 08:12.600\nOkay, well, Dan, maybe you haven't heard this one, a Russian, a German and Belman wanted\n\n08:12.600 --> 08:17.680\nto see who could swim the fastest across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n08:17.680 --> 08:20.440\nFirst out was the German, you know, of course.\n\n08:20.440 --> 08:24.080\nHe swam one kilometer and drowned.\n\n08:24.080 --> 08:25.640\nNext came the Russian.\n\n08:25.640 --> 08:29.320\nHe swam 10 kilometers, he drowned.\n\n08:29.320 --> 08:31.200\nNow it was Belman's turn.\n\n08:31.200 --> 08:37.880\nHe swam and swam until he almost reached America, then he got tired and swam back.\n\n08:37.880 --> 08:38.880\nLet's see.\n\n08:38.880 --> 08:39.880\nNow that's a hero.\n\n08:39.880 --> 08:40.880\nYeah, right.\n\n08:40.880 --> 08:45.960\nSometimes Belman, it's like a weird fusion of like in America where someone has to be\n\n08:45.960 --> 08:51.080\nbeing shit on or whatever, but it's interesting to me that it's like, so we were like, oh,\n\n08:51.080 --> 08:53.920\nwhat an interesting joke format, what an interesting thing.\n\n08:53.920 --> 08:59.520\nYeah, because it's not a pollock joke, it's not an n-bomb joke, it's not a racist joke.\n\n08:59.520 --> 09:03.400\nIt's also not like a jingoistic, like fucking Swedes do it, the best joke.\n\n09:03.400 --> 09:05.280\nI got two questions.\n\n09:05.280 --> 09:07.000\nIs Belman a first or a last name?\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.200\nI think, I would say first, I guess.\n\n09:09.200 --> 09:13.560\nIs it supposed to be a reference to their race or like ethnic, like is it supposed to\n\n09:13.560 --> 09:14.560\nbe that's us?\n\n09:14.560 --> 09:15.560\nI think it's probably.\n\n09:15.560 --> 09:18.640\nBecause they put it in context with other people from countries, so it's like.\n\n09:18.640 --> 09:19.640\nYeah, I think that's the joke.\n\n09:19.640 --> 09:24.560\nSpencer, as far as Wikipedia is concerned, the jokes first became popular in the 19th\n\n09:24.560 --> 09:30.560\ncentury and originally inspired the life of the poet and composer Carl Michael Belman.\n\n09:30.560 --> 09:36.760\nThe first known Belman joke survived in a book from 1835, so it goes back that far.\n\n09:36.760 --> 09:40.640\nSo that's almost like just like having Mr. Bean be a character in a joke.\n\n09:40.640 --> 09:44.520\nYeah, that's how we interpreted it, is that it's sort of like Fred Flintstone or like,\n\n09:44.520 --> 09:48.720\neven if his name was Kowalski or something.\n\n09:48.720 --> 09:54.160\nWe don't have a national identity like that, like we don't have like a Joe Blow or something.\n\n09:54.160 --> 09:58.600\nHe's so outside of having an identity though in these jokes because he's the third person\n\n09:58.600 --> 10:02.760\nto be set up and he's the only one whose race isn't called that.\n\n10:02.760 --> 10:05.840\nHe's not a race, he's kind of a disembodied character.\n\n10:05.840 --> 10:07.040\nHe's a neutral country.\n\n10:07.040 --> 10:12.040\nWait, that's Switzerland.\n\n10:12.040 --> 10:18.280\nBut isn't it sort of like there, you know, you're Swedish and you, I think that's part\n\n10:18.280 --> 10:19.280\nof it though.\n\n10:19.280 --> 10:25.200\nAs you'll see in the Belman joke that we wrote, thank you, we took a half hour and we wrote\n\n10:25.200 --> 10:26.200\na Belman joke.\n\n10:26.200 --> 10:28.920\nLet's be honest, it took us nearly an hour, 45 minutes.\n\n10:28.920 --> 10:31.560\nOkay, I'm going to see if I can come up with a Belman joke.\n\n10:31.560 --> 10:37.080\nSpencer, can you riff a Belman, do you already think that you have a handle on that premise\n\n10:37.080 --> 10:38.080\nso well that you can do it?\n\n10:38.080 --> 10:40.240\nNo, I'll need a half hour to nearly an hour, I think.\n\n10:40.240 --> 10:44.000\nOkay, well it should take me about that time to tell ours because I'm not that good at\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:48.920\ntelling jokes, but I wrote down the bullet points, Jeff and I took like an hour.\n\n10:48.920 --> 10:54.040\nWe wanted to see, could we make our friend Sophia the Swede laugh with a Belman joke?\n\n10:54.040 --> 10:56.640\nLaugh with a proper Swedish Belman joke.\n\n10:56.640 --> 10:59.240\nSo here's what we did.\n\n10:59.240 --> 11:02.920\nWe took it or leave it, but I think we fucking nailed it.\n\n11:02.920 --> 11:03.920\nWe fucking did it.\n\n11:03.920 --> 11:06.760\nI'm really proud of it and she laughed.\n\n11:06.760 --> 11:07.760\nShe laughed.\n\n11:07.760 --> 11:08.760\nThere's some sort of reaction.\n\n11:08.760 --> 11:09.760\nWe told it.\n\n11:09.760 --> 11:13.800\nWe got to the punchline and she went, is that like she kind of like she went over it like\n\n11:13.800 --> 11:14.800\na pothole.\n\n11:14.800 --> 11:20.640\nShe couldn't believe that we updated and contemporized fucking Belman jokes.\n\n11:20.640 --> 11:25.620\nOkay, so you know my history with telling jokes, but this is so this is like an evil\n\n11:25.620 --> 11:29.480\ncannibal fuck feet here, this is where we might run into trouble.\n\n11:29.480 --> 11:30.480\nYou have it written down.\n\n11:30.480 --> 11:31.480\nI do.\n\n11:31.480 --> 11:32.480\nI have my bullet points.\n\n11:32.480 --> 11:33.480\nOkay.\n\n11:33.480 --> 11:34.480\nBullet points.\n\n11:34.480 --> 11:35.480\nYou don't have it written down.\n\n11:35.480 --> 11:36.480\nI haven't bullet points.\n\n11:36.480 --> 11:37.480\nOkay.\n\n11:37.480 --> 11:39.680\nA good joke is somewhat rift.\n\n11:39.680 --> 11:45.720\nWell, I, is that, is that, all right, guys, you know, come on, give me a, I feel like a\n\n11:45.720 --> 11:50.600\nreal Belman right now or I'm going to prove myself to be a Belman because I'm going to\n\n11:50.600 --> 11:51.600\ncome through in the end.\n\n11:51.600 --> 11:53.040\nI'm going to, in a weird way.\n\n11:53.040 --> 11:54.040\nAll right.\n\n11:54.040 --> 11:55.040\nJust look, here's our Belman joke.\n\n11:55.040 --> 11:56.040\nHere it is.\n\n11:56.040 --> 12:02.760\nJeff, Jeff and I wrote this at the drawing room, took us 45, 45 minutes.\n\n12:02.760 --> 12:06.400\nIt's the year 2019 AD.\n\n12:06.400 --> 12:10.400\nEarth has made first contact with an alien species.\n\n12:10.400 --> 12:17.840\nThe message from this mysterious alien species is we are here to destroy you.\n\n12:17.840 --> 12:23.600\nIf you are not worthy, send three emissaries from your species.\n\n12:23.600 --> 12:26.720\nEach can bring one item.\n\n12:26.720 --> 12:29.160\nA lottery is held.\n\n12:29.160 --> 12:32.480\nThe emissaries are chosen.\n\n12:32.480 --> 12:42.360\nA Dutch astronaut, a German astronaut and Belman.\n\n12:42.360 --> 12:49.600\nThe astronauts are placed into the prescribed craft.\n\n12:49.600 --> 12:55.320\nIt is sent up to the mothership orbiting the earth.\n\n12:55.320 --> 12:57.920\nThe airlock opens.\n\n12:57.920 --> 13:09.400\nThe omnipotent ominous aliens send their emissary into the vestibule of the ship.\n\n13:09.400 --> 13:12.000\nOur astronauts enter with their items.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.080\nWhat have you brought?\n\n13:15.080 --> 13:17.040\nSays the alien.\n\n13:17.040 --> 13:19.160\nThe Dutch astronaut steps forward.\n\n13:19.160 --> 13:23.400\nI have brought this model of a windmill.\n\n13:23.400 --> 13:29.320\nThe Dutch were the first to harness the natural resources of the earth, and although our species\n\n13:29.320 --> 13:37.160\ncurrently lives in conflict with our planet, this is evidence that our people have it in\n\n13:37.160 --> 13:44.680\nthem as early as the dawn of civilization to live in harmony with Mother Gaia.\n\n13:44.680 --> 13:49.320\nWhat have you brought?\n\n13:49.320 --> 13:54.600\nThe German astronaut pulls out a pistol.\n\n13:54.600 --> 13:57.600\nThis is a German Luger pistol.\n\n13:57.600 --> 14:02.800\nIt is the peak of German engineering.\n\n14:02.800 --> 14:09.720\nYes, it is war-based, but your species did say you were here to destroy us if we didn't\n\n14:09.720 --> 14:11.640\nprove ourselves.\n\n14:11.640 --> 14:18.080\nThis is evidence that we have it in us to follow perfect order and have perfect hierarchy,\n\n14:18.080 --> 14:24.560\nand that the results can be this, this perfect piece of engineering that has literally never\n\n14:24.560 --> 14:30.840\nmisfired a shot, the German Luger.\n\n14:30.840 --> 14:39.520\nAnd what have you, Belman, pulls out a camera, says, I brought a Hasselblad camera.\n\n14:39.520 --> 14:41.640\nIt's a Swedish camera.\n\n14:41.640 --> 14:44.840\nIt's state-of-the-art.\n\n14:44.840 --> 14:46.200\nWhy?\n\n14:46.200 --> 14:48.520\nBecause nobody's going to believe this shit.\n\n14:48.520 --> 14:49.520\nYeah.\n\n14:49.520 --> 14:54.520\nThat's a good Belman joke.\n\n14:54.520 --> 15:00.280\nLadies and gentlemen, Belman, that's a good Belman joke.\n\n15:00.280 --> 15:03.520\nAnd then I think the rest of it, as you can imagine, I think the aliens like, I like this\n\n15:03.520 --> 15:07.520\nguy, planet Belman.\n\n15:07.520 --> 15:11.520\nOr do they, do they kill, who do they, do they have to stick?\n\n15:11.520 --> 15:12.520\nI don't know.\n\n15:12.520 --> 15:15.000\nMy favorite part of the joke is the Dana Ma.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:20.040\nWhat happens after the Polish guy eats all of the pea-soaked popcorn instead of having\n\n15:20.040 --> 15:21.040\nsex with the farmer's daughter?\n\n15:21.040 --> 15:25.640\nI mean, certainly a stomach ache.\n\n15:25.640 --> 15:26.640\nYeah.\n\n15:26.640 --> 15:32.960\nBut like, let's say you put yourself in the pants, if aliens wear pants, which one do\n\n15:32.960 --> 15:33.960\nyou pick?\n\n15:33.960 --> 15:37.480\nDo you pick the, the aliens that we're here to, the aliens that we're here to pick?\n\n15:37.480 --> 15:40.160\nThe peaceful engineering of the Dutch?\n\n15:40.160 --> 15:42.080\nThe warlike engineering of the Germans?\n\n15:42.080 --> 15:46.280\nOr the ironic, I get the joke, Belman?\n\n15:46.280 --> 15:47.280\nThey weren't here to pick.\n\n15:47.280 --> 15:51.680\nThey wanted to see if we had, if our civilization had generated a Belman.\n\n15:51.680 --> 15:54.920\nYou know, I think when you're, when you're playing, when your species gets to the point\n\n15:54.920 --> 16:00.200\nwhere it's capable of Belman production, you're like, okay, you're, you're all right.\n\n16:00.200 --> 16:04.720\nAnd probably another alien comes out and goes, I'm the alien equivalent of Belman.\n\n16:04.720 --> 16:09.920\nLike long ago, people didn't understand a goofy horse sense.\n\n16:09.920 --> 16:13.360\nSpencer, do you think you're ready for your Belman joke or do you need some time?\n\n16:13.360 --> 16:18.280\nI just want to say that I think that you really did what a scripted joke could not have accomplished\n\n16:18.280 --> 16:21.120\nby going off book and using those, that outline.\n\n16:21.120 --> 16:22.240\nSo thank you.\n\n16:22.240 --> 16:24.840\nI was, you elevated the material.\n\n16:24.840 --> 16:25.840\nYeah.\n\n16:25.840 --> 16:27.680\nAnd I, and I don't think you're being sarcastic.\n\n16:27.680 --> 16:30.360\nI'm not, but I could be.\n\n16:30.360 --> 16:31.360\nYeah.\n\n16:31.360 --> 16:33.080\nBut I choose to believe that you're not.\n\n16:33.080 --> 16:35.320\nWell, yeah, I think the tension there is maybe.\n\n16:35.320 --> 16:40.920\nSpencer, your black outfit is blending into the background and you look like a disembodied\n\n16:40.920 --> 16:41.920\nghost person.\n\n16:41.920 --> 16:43.360\nThat's all I've always wished I would be.\n\n16:43.360 --> 16:48.480\nDid I tell you guys that I imagined my head like running around like, like it like hops\n\n16:48.480 --> 16:55.240\noff my body and like runs around on little beard feet, you know, like, did you have,\n\n16:55.240 --> 16:57.000\ndid you have a Belman joke?\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.080\nI came up with one.\n\n16:58.080 --> 17:00.760\nI'm not proud of it, but you know, that was the task.\n\n17:00.760 --> 17:04.120\nIf you come up with one that quickly, you don't have to be proud of it.\n\n17:04.120 --> 17:07.000\nYou can be proud that you came up with a Belman joke that quickly.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nOkay.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:09.000\nLike later.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nWell, then I am.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:11.000\nAll right.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:18.680\nSo in Elf, a dwarf and Belmont are outside of a dungeon, as I say, I became hysterical.\n\n17:18.680 --> 17:19.880\nYou're outside of what?\n\n17:19.880 --> 17:20.880\nA dungeon.\n\n17:20.880 --> 17:21.880\nOkay.\n\n17:21.880 --> 17:25.960\nAnd the elf goes like, I'm going to get that treasure and goes in there and five minutes\n\n17:25.960 --> 17:26.960\nlater comes back out.\n\n17:26.960 --> 17:28.520\nAnd he's like, Jesus Christ, there's no trees.\n\n17:28.520 --> 17:29.520\nIt's claustrophobic in there.\n\n17:29.520 --> 17:30.520\nI can't hack it.\n\n17:30.520 --> 17:33.280\nAnd the dwarf's like, ha, ha, fucking elves.\n\n17:33.280 --> 17:35.760\nAnd then the dwarf goes in there and then he comes out.\n\n17:35.760 --> 17:39.200\nHe's all scratched up and bloody and he's like, this place is full of orcs, man.\n\n17:39.200 --> 17:40.360\nI'm not going back.\n\n17:40.360 --> 17:41.920\nThere's no way the treasure's worth that.\n\n17:41.920 --> 17:44.640\nAnd then Belmont's like, I got this, you guys.\n\n17:44.640 --> 17:47.720\nAnd then he comes back like two hours later and he's just fine.\n\n17:47.720 --> 17:50.320\nAnd everyone's like, what, what, what happened?\n\n17:50.320 --> 17:52.040\nHe's like, you guys were totally right, man.\n\n17:52.040 --> 17:53.880\nThere was like, the place was terrible.\n\n17:53.880 --> 17:57.400\nThere was like just a bunch of dusty coins and stuff.\n\n17:57.400 --> 18:01.080\nYou see, because he got the treasure, but he didn't care for it.\n\n18:01.080 --> 18:02.080\nRight.\n\n18:02.080 --> 18:03.080\nOh, he didn't care.\n\n18:03.080 --> 18:07.040\nHe didn't like the treasure because the Belmont has a different standard.\n\n18:07.040 --> 18:08.040\nRight.\n\n18:08.040 --> 18:09.040\nYeah.\n\n18:09.040 --> 18:10.040\nThat's fucking great.\n\n18:10.040 --> 18:11.520\nNo, it's not great.\n\n18:11.520 --> 18:15.600\nIt certainly passes the test of being a Belmont joke on some level.\n\n18:15.600 --> 18:16.880\nI think it's not great.\n\n18:16.880 --> 18:22.280\nOne tweak would be, I think if you, if each of them were specified as coming out empty-handed.\n\n18:22.280 --> 18:26.000\nSo that when Belmont comes out empty-handed and then he's like, yeah.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:27.000\nYeah.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nAll right.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:33.800\nWell, I stuck to the script and that was my flow.\n\n18:33.800 --> 18:37.000\nOur next guest needs no introduction.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.920\nHe's been touring clubs and colleges all across the nation.\n\n18:40.920 --> 18:45.000\nYou might have missed him on Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:51.920\nHe's been a good friend of mine for a long time and a good friend of the show and a good\n\n18:51.920 --> 18:54.320\nfriend of entertainment in general.\n\n18:54.320 --> 18:57.320\nPlease welcome Rob Schrab.\n\n18:57.320 --> 19:02.320\nOh, no.\n\n19:02.320 --> 19:22.320\nAll right, Rob, do you want to try to freestyle a Belmont joke?\n\n19:22.320 --> 19:28.480\nIt's a tripartite joke where one person is either the hero or the dummy.\n\n19:28.480 --> 19:30.680\nHard to tell which.\n\n19:30.680 --> 19:32.560\nIt's kind of like the Schrabbing of jokes.\n\n19:32.560 --> 19:39.320\nI'm so, have you guys been having a hard time with 2018?\n\n19:39.320 --> 19:40.320\nYeah.\n\n19:40.320 --> 19:45.320\nThat's gone pretty seamlessly for me so far.\n\n19:45.320 --> 19:49.320\nI mean, I haven't, I've been having a.\n\n19:49.320 --> 19:52.320\n10, 10, shush, shush.\n\n19:52.320 --> 19:53.320\nI haven't.\n\n19:53.320 --> 19:54.320\nIt's my mic on.\n\n19:54.320 --> 20:00.520\nI've just, I haven't been a hard time getting up in the morning.\n\n20:00.520 --> 20:01.520\nLike it was difficult.\n\n20:01.520 --> 20:05.680\nIt was difficult for me to come over here.\n\n20:05.680 --> 20:11.320\nI have not really, I got a lot of work I could be doing and it's not even that much.\n\n20:11.320 --> 20:16.320\nIt's not even an overwhelming workload, but I still, I've, I really am still in vacation\n\n20:16.320 --> 20:17.320\nmode.\n\n20:17.320 --> 20:21.160\nI, yeah, I'm having like a hard turn.\n\n20:21.160 --> 20:22.320\nI'm having a hard turn.\n\n20:22.320 --> 20:31.080\nI'm going through, I don't, I go to bed early, I sleep late, I'm, I don't go out, I'm home,\n\n20:31.080 --> 20:33.320\nI order in a lot.\n\n20:33.320 --> 20:42.120\nDoes Kate, Kate goes, goes, plays magic cards and VR and hangs out in Malibu and it's just\n\n20:42.120 --> 20:43.120\nme and the dog.\n\n20:43.120 --> 20:48.720\nCody and I are definitely enabling each other, like we just, every weekend, we just, we can't\n\n20:48.720 --> 20:52.680\nwait to get to the weekend and then we jump into bed and we just turn into fucking potatoes\n\n20:52.680 --> 20:53.680\nand just, we just don't.\n\n20:53.680 --> 20:55.680\nI've been doing that a lot.\n\n20:55.680 --> 20:56.680\nBut you're doing it regardless.\n\n20:56.680 --> 21:01.120\nYou know, Kate's going like, okay, I'm going to Malibu to play magic ballering and you're\n\n21:01.120 --> 21:02.120\nlike.\n\n21:02.120 --> 21:03.760\nI've been also meditating.\n\n21:03.760 --> 21:09.640\nI've been meditating a lot, like, which is, I'm taking a nap for how long?\n\n21:09.640 --> 21:17.360\nLike, I'll, like, I'll set my insight timer for 20 minutes, but I'll, I'll set the alarm.\n\n21:17.360 --> 21:21.200\nIf you meditate too long, you could go crazy, you know, have you read about that?\n\n21:21.200 --> 21:22.200\nNo.\n\n21:22.200 --> 21:25.040\nI mean, it has to be in the neighborhood of like 48 hours.\n\n21:25.040 --> 21:26.040\nDon't worry about it.\n\n21:26.040 --> 21:33.840\nA Buddhist, a Hindu and a Belman go to Nirvana start meditating and they try to achieve Nirvana\n\n21:33.840 --> 21:37.400\ntogether and the Hindu says, I'll go into Nirvana first.\n\n21:37.400 --> 21:41.960\nI've been taking transit meditation classes.\n\n21:41.960 --> 21:42.960\nYou've been taking what?\n\n21:42.960 --> 21:43.960\nSorry.\n\n21:43.960 --> 21:44.960\nTranscendental meditation classes.\n\n21:44.960 --> 21:45.960\nOh, okay.\n\n21:45.960 --> 21:46.960\nYeah.\n\n21:46.960 --> 21:48.360\nI went to one of those orientations for that.\n\n21:48.360 --> 21:49.360\nOh yeah.\n\n21:49.360 --> 21:50.360\nIt's like right around the block.\n\n21:50.360 --> 21:51.360\nYeah.\n\n21:51.360 --> 21:52.360\nJonah Ray was there.\n\n21:52.360 --> 21:53.360\nOh, really?\n\n21:53.360 --> 21:55.760\nI'm sure he doesn't mind me saying that.\n\n21:55.760 --> 21:57.960\nHe was put up to it by Joel Hodgson, our good friend.\n\n21:57.960 --> 21:58.960\nYeah.\n\n21:58.960 --> 21:59.960\nSame here.\n\n21:59.960 --> 22:00.960\nIt was really into TM.\n\n22:00.960 --> 22:01.960\nYeah.\n\n22:01.960 --> 22:02.960\nYou know what?\n\n22:02.960 --> 22:03.960\nIt's the fucking best.\n\n22:03.960 --> 22:09.680\nIt's like three years ago, he goes, I think you really need to be doing this, man.\n\n22:09.680 --> 22:16.200\nI think with your, like the way your mind works, you got to get up inside that mother\n\n22:16.200 --> 22:17.200\ngrabber.\n\n22:17.200 --> 22:18.200\nYeah.\n\n22:18.200 --> 22:22.480\nYou guys got to really like down into it.\n\n22:22.480 --> 22:23.480\nNow.\n\n22:23.480 --> 22:24.480\nNow.\n\n22:24.480 --> 22:25.480\nSo I didn't.\n\n22:25.480 --> 22:26.480\nI really, I enjoyed it.\n\n22:26.480 --> 22:27.480\nYeah.\n\n22:27.480 --> 22:28.480\nI've been.\n\n22:28.480 --> 22:29.480\nDid you grab that mother?\n\n22:29.480 --> 22:30.480\nI grabbed a mother.\n\n22:30.480 --> 22:33.160\nI can't remember why Cody and I didn't go back.\n\n22:33.160 --> 22:39.400\nIt wasn't like, I think it was just like, I think it, oh, you know what?\n\n22:39.400 --> 22:42.720\nIt was because they said you can't get high.\n\n22:42.720 --> 22:43.920\nCody was like peace.\n\n22:43.920 --> 22:48.400\nLike in general or before the class, like you have to, like you're not supposed to get\n\n22:48.400 --> 22:49.400\nhigh.\n\n22:49.400 --> 22:54.680\nThey said, you know, to get like an actual, you know, as you start out, it wasn't like\n\n22:54.680 --> 23:00.320\nfor the rest of your life, it was like, if you're going to do this, you're going to,\n\n23:00.320 --> 23:08.760\nyou know, to get a proper version of what hopefully will help you try not to drink or\n\n23:08.760 --> 23:10.760\nget high or whatever.\n\n23:10.760 --> 23:14.880\nOr they even said, don't take a nap before, you know, just little things like that.\n\n23:14.880 --> 23:15.880\nYeah.\n\n23:15.880 --> 23:16.880\nNo, I know it was temporary.\n\n23:16.880 --> 23:17.880\nIt wasn't like that.\n\n23:17.880 --> 23:18.880\nBut still, deal breaker.\n\n23:18.880 --> 23:19.880\nYeah.\n\n23:19.880 --> 23:24.000\nLike we're not having kids because I think, you know, like Cody was like, well, maybe\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.200\nwe should freeze our eggs.\n\n23:25.200 --> 23:26.200\nThat's extreme.\n\n23:26.200 --> 23:30.480\nAnd then you go, okay, step one to freeze your eggs, don't get high for the done.\n\n23:30.480 --> 23:31.480\nForget it.\n\n23:31.480 --> 23:32.480\nPeace.\n\n23:32.480 --> 23:35.520\nYou, you two really like getting high.\n\n23:35.520 --> 23:36.520\nI really like Cody.\n\n23:36.520 --> 23:37.800\nShe really, really likes getting high.\n\n23:37.800 --> 23:41.680\nI should get high more than drink less.\n\n23:41.680 --> 23:44.600\nI get high and then I go to bed.\n\n23:44.600 --> 23:45.600\nYeah.\n\n23:45.600 --> 23:46.600\nMe too.\n\n23:46.600 --> 23:49.360\nI eat and then I go to bed.\n\n23:49.360 --> 23:52.120\nI turn on the television and I go to bed.\n\n23:52.120 --> 23:53.120\nYeah, man.\n\n23:53.120 --> 23:54.120\nI'm falling apart.\n\n23:54.120 --> 23:55.120\nNo, man.\n\n23:55.120 --> 23:56.440\nThis is a cry for help.\n\n23:56.440 --> 23:57.440\nYou're just sleeping.\n\n23:57.440 --> 23:59.040\nWhat are you supposed to, what do you want to do?\n\n23:59.040 --> 24:02.960\nYou want to be a CG head in the bucket list, like falling out of a plane?\n\n24:02.960 --> 24:07.280\nLike, like what, don't, don't let people trick you into thinking that life is about going\n\n24:07.280 --> 24:09.920\noutside or, or flying a kite.\n\n24:09.920 --> 24:10.920\nLike what the fuck?\n\n24:10.920 --> 24:11.920\nWho cares?\n\n24:11.920 --> 24:12.920\nThose people are morons.\n\n24:12.920 --> 24:13.920\nI'm not happy though.\n\n24:13.920 --> 24:14.920\nOh, okay.\n\n24:14.920 --> 24:15.920\nWell, let's see.\n\n24:15.920 --> 24:16.920\nThat's, that's it.\n\n24:16.920 --> 24:21.240\nBut, but, but in case you're not happy because you think you should be doing something else,\n\n24:21.240 --> 24:23.240\nthat could be, that could be part of the whole syndrome.\n\n24:23.240 --> 24:24.240\nThat's a little bit of it too.\n\n24:24.240 --> 24:28.160\nI think if you step on the gas and go, I want to be in bed, you know, that's how I quit\n\n24:28.160 --> 24:29.160\nsmoking.\n\n24:29.160 --> 24:30.160\nIt was like, I'm going to fucking smoke this cigarette.\n\n24:30.160 --> 24:32.760\nI'm going to smoke the shit out of this fucking cigarette.\n\n24:32.760 --> 24:38.240\nLike I'm sick and tired of pretending I'm trying to quit or resenting people for telling\n\n24:38.240 --> 24:39.240\nme I should quit.\n\n24:39.240 --> 24:40.240\nIt's like, I'm smoking.\n\n24:40.240 --> 24:41.240\nOkay.\n\n24:41.240 --> 24:43.520\nI'm going to smoke this cigarette and I'd look at each cigarette and I'd go like, get\n\n24:43.520 --> 24:45.560\nready to get smoked, you little fuck.\n\n24:45.560 --> 24:46.560\nAnd I'd smoke it.\n\n24:46.560 --> 24:51.000\nAnd I'd be like, and then I, that, that was the first step down the road to getting to\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nquit smoking.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nRight.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nLike being intentional.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:55.000\nRight.\n\n24:55.000 --> 25:00.720\nIt's like, like instead of pretending and being unconscious about things, you know, not wanting\n\n25:00.720 --> 25:06.480\nto face things is a big, that seals off a mental process that could just make thoughts\n\n25:06.480 --> 25:10.240\nlike magnify and, and, but simultaneously they're sealed off.\n\n25:10.240 --> 25:12.680\nSo you're not even knowing they're magnified.\n\n25:12.680 --> 25:18.280\nThat's where you get your classic guy, you know, sipping coffee and, and, and then the,\n\n25:18.280 --> 25:23.280\nthey run out of Splenda and he takes a knife out and kills everybody because the classic.\n\n25:23.280 --> 25:24.280\nYeah.\n\n25:24.280 --> 25:25.280\nYou know, it's just that thing.\n\n25:25.280 --> 25:26.280\nThat's like,\n\n25:26.280 --> 25:27.280\nWhat are you unhappy about?\n\n25:27.280 --> 25:28.280\nRob?\n\n25:28.280 --> 25:31.200\nI just unfulfilled, you know, professionally probably, right?\n\n25:31.200 --> 25:33.200\nNot creatively or both.\n\n25:33.200 --> 25:38.240\nBecause usually there's creative and professional and they're kind of not necessarily the same.\n\n25:38.240 --> 25:40.840\nI just, it's not fun anymore.\n\n25:40.840 --> 25:41.840\nRight.\n\n25:41.840 --> 25:42.840\nYeah.\n\n25:42.840 --> 25:49.040\nAnd I, I miss that and, you know, and everybody wants to help and say, well, you got to go\n\n25:49.040 --> 25:50.040\nout.\n\n25:50.040 --> 25:51.040\nYou got to read.\n\n25:51.040 --> 25:52.040\nYou got to do some stuff.\n\n25:52.040 --> 25:56.560\nIt's just like, yeah, I know, but that doesn't, it doesn't help.\n\n25:56.560 --> 25:57.560\nI don't want to help.\n\n25:57.560 --> 26:01.680\nI want, I want you to, I want you to fucking pop like a, because I know it'll be great.\n\n26:01.680 --> 26:05.680\nYou know, it's like, I want you to get so fucking sad and angry and, and sick of the\n\n26:05.680 --> 26:11.160\nworld and selfish and that you take all of that talent that you can't escape and just\n\n26:11.160 --> 26:16.440\nfucking smash it like Eddie Van Halen guitar and like create some crazy new form of music\n\n26:16.440 --> 26:18.120\nthat, you know, no pressure.\n\n26:18.120 --> 26:23.120\nI, I, I just, you know, I, I, I just like, I like making little animations and put them\n\n26:23.120 --> 26:24.120\non Instagram or whatever.\n\n26:24.120 --> 26:29.680\nLike you're, I think you need to do what Justin did when he, when he, you know, when he started\n\n26:29.680 --> 26:34.440\ndoing the voices that became Rick and Morty, it was because he was like, he was mad and\n\n26:34.440 --> 26:35.600\nlonely and sad.\n\n26:35.600 --> 26:40.320\nLike he hated like working and like he, he, and he just wanted to take a shit on back\n\n26:40.320 --> 26:41.320\nto the future.\n\n26:41.320 --> 26:46.440\nSo he just, he's just, he's just alienated, you know, it's like, just follow it.\n\n26:46.440 --> 26:49.320\nLike think about how fucking much you hate everybody.\n\n26:49.320 --> 26:50.320\nLike they're stupid.\n\n26:50.320 --> 26:51.320\nThey control your life.\n\n26:51.320 --> 26:53.320\nI don't want to hate anybody.\n\n26:53.320 --> 26:58.520\nI just, I just, it's, it's just getting, it's like, you, or how much you hate yourself\n\n26:58.520 --> 26:59.520\nthem.\n\n26:59.520 --> 27:00.520\nWell, okay.\n\n27:00.520 --> 27:01.520\nAll right.\n\n27:01.520 --> 27:07.440\nWell, it's, it's, it's like waking up and going, this again, yeah, this, this, this,\n\n27:07.440 --> 27:08.440\nI got it.\n\n27:08.440 --> 27:13.840\nI got, I got 12 hours of this before it's okay for me to go back to sleep, go back to\n\n27:13.840 --> 27:14.840\nbed.\n\n27:14.840 --> 27:15.840\nWe'll capture that.\n\n27:15.840 --> 27:20.920\nI'm already, I'm already captivated by your, your expressing it.\n\n27:20.920 --> 27:22.280\nYou're always going to be an artist.\n\n27:22.280 --> 27:28.360\nLike I, I, I guy, you know, you know how a guy at Dunkin Donuts says what you just said.\n\n27:28.360 --> 27:31.600\nHe says something that he heard on a television.\n\n27:31.600 --> 27:36.080\nHe says same shit different day and he, and then he, and then he rapes somebody.\n\n27:36.080 --> 27:38.240\nI don't want to rape anyone.\n\n27:38.240 --> 27:40.520\nWhat would be the, the, like the dream.\n\n27:40.520 --> 27:41.520\nI don't know.\n\n27:41.520 --> 27:42.520\nThat's the thing.\n\n27:42.520 --> 27:46.840\nIf you woke up and said, oh, I'm creating, I'm working, I'm doing this thing, what would\n\n27:46.840 --> 27:47.840\nthat be?\n\n27:47.840 --> 27:48.840\nI don't know.\n\n27:48.840 --> 27:49.840\nI don't know what that would be.\n\n27:49.840 --> 27:52.680\nI mean, I literally can do whatever I want right now.\n\n27:52.680 --> 27:56.640\nI mean, I, I'm sitting on a ton of savings.\n\n27:56.640 --> 27:58.800\nI, I don't have many expenses.\n\n27:58.800 --> 28:01.720\nI could jump on a plane and go anywhere I want.\n\n28:01.720 --> 28:04.040\nI could invest all my money into something.\n\n28:04.040 --> 28:07.000\nAnd I just, I'm like, I don't know.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:10.440\nIt's just this severe, sad apathy.\n\n28:10.440 --> 28:14.000\nI feel the exact same way, except without as much money.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:15.840\nI mean, certainly I'm more comfortable than I have.\n\n28:15.840 --> 28:19.400\nYou could get on like a twin prop and go a couple places in California.\n\n28:19.400 --> 28:20.640\nLet's go like fly.\n\n28:20.640 --> 28:28.240\nI vote for going like, like, like following your assessment of the monotony though.\n\n28:28.240 --> 28:33.200\nI think that that's how caterpillars start to spin a cocoon, that you feel sluggish.\n\n28:33.200 --> 28:34.200\nYou're full of leaves.\n\n28:34.200 --> 28:35.820\nYou don't want to eat them anymore.\n\n28:35.820 --> 28:37.720\nYou have all the energy you need.\n\n28:37.720 --> 28:42.640\nIt's just all like your metabolism is down and a transformation is about to happen.\n\n28:42.640 --> 28:46.600\nAnd the caterpillar, we don't want our, if we like our butterflies, we don't want our\n\n28:46.600 --> 28:51.160\ncaterpillars like forcing themselves to go to yoga when they feel that way.\n\n28:51.160 --> 28:59.120\nWe want them to like do like double down on that feeling because locked somewhere in there\n\n28:59.120 --> 29:02.520\nis the beginning of a new phase.\n\n29:02.520 --> 29:11.200\nYou're, you're, you're lucky to have a logical stopping point emotionally where things just\n\n29:11.200 --> 29:15.360\nfeel like, okay, I think that can be incredibly depressing.\n\n29:15.360 --> 29:19.520\nYou know, when you finish a draft, you finish a job, like there's that postpartum depression\n\n29:19.520 --> 29:24.400\nbecause, but it's like, it's because you're done with one thing and you haven't started\n\n29:24.400 --> 29:26.320\nanother yet and you feel useless.\n\n29:26.320 --> 29:28.000\nAnd I know that's not what you're feeling right now.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:32.680\nYou feel like it's in a larger scale, but I'm saying that's because you're, you're the\n\n29:32.680 --> 29:37.400\nproject that you've finished isn't as simple as, oh, I just did this thing with JJ Abrams\n\n29:37.400 --> 29:40.120\nand now I got to look for another job.\n\n29:40.120 --> 29:45.000\nIt's a chapter of your life that is ending and that, and that it could be a regression\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:46.000\nto childhood.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:54.240\nLike you may need to get your, your little cardboard things back out and fucking and,\n\n29:54.240 --> 29:59.760\nand I would say, instead of forcing yourself, I'm gonna, I'm gonna make like a new franchise.\n\n29:59.760 --> 30:02.360\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna do this amazing thing.\n\n30:02.360 --> 30:08.440\nLike I like this, I like this thought of you turning your gaze on the clockwork of life\n\n30:08.440 --> 30:11.480\nwhere you're like looking at how pointless it all is.\n\n30:11.480 --> 30:13.440\nYou're going like, this is what life is.\n\n30:13.440 --> 30:19.400\nThis is like, I'm like killing time between naps and I can't get out of bed and like time\n\n30:19.400 --> 30:22.320\nmeans nothing and life means nothing and all this stuff.\n\n30:22.320 --> 30:25.440\nI'd love to see your blue period, you know?\n\n30:25.440 --> 30:26.440\nYeah.\n\n30:26.440 --> 30:33.320\nNow, I mean, I, I've been thinking about that like a lot, like in the last year, just like,\n\n30:33.320 --> 30:34.840\nwhat do I really want to be doing?\n\n30:34.840 --> 30:41.920\nYou know, you've had, I've had this trajectory of doing a certain, living a certain life,\n\n30:41.920 --> 30:45.680\nyou know, since I was like eight years old, you know, and I'm living it, you know, I've\n\n30:45.680 --> 30:52.680\ndone pretty much everything I've ever set out to do, at least tasted it, and now I'm\n\n30:52.680 --> 30:55.680\nlike, well, wasn't that great?\n\n30:55.680 --> 30:59.280\nWell, it's great, it's fine, but where's the surprise?\n\n30:59.280 --> 31:04.680\nWhere's the, where's the person that said, oh, I'm instead, I, I, one day, you know,\n\n31:04.680 --> 31:08.880\nI mean, like the, the, the, you hear the story of somebody doing the opposite of what we're\n\n31:08.880 --> 31:14.080\ndoing, you know, the lawyer that said, I, I want to write, uh, the, the diehard three,\n\n31:14.080 --> 31:17.760\nyou know, like, and goes out and does it, you know, and leaves that world behind and\n\n31:17.760 --> 31:23.680\nbecomes a creative, like, what's the opposite of the creative person who has done nothing\n\n31:23.680 --> 31:26.880\nbut being creative this entire life, even for fun.\n\n31:26.880 --> 31:32.920\nDo you think as a version of you, Rob, that even if you wrote the perfect thing, got all\n\n31:32.920 --> 31:35.480\nthe kudos for it that would make you happy?\n\n31:35.480 --> 31:41.440\nLike, well, I've already done that and, and, and it's, and it's, it's, it makes you happy,\n\n31:41.440 --> 31:45.120\nbut being happy and being satisfied are not necessarily the same thing.\n\n31:45.120 --> 31:49.080\nWell, that's a satisfied, like, like, what, like, is there a version where you go, oh,\n\n31:49.080 --> 31:54.360\nI did, I crossed a finish line that made me feel satisfied.\n\n31:54.360 --> 31:59.160\nLike, is, is there a work thing, a drawing that you could do, a movie you could write,\n\n31:59.160 --> 32:05.920\na award you could win that you would cross that threshold and go, oh, I feel good.\n\n32:05.920 --> 32:08.320\nUh, I, I miss being proud.\n\n32:08.320 --> 32:11.040\nWell, then what would make you?\n\n32:11.040 --> 32:12.040\nWell, I don't know.\n\n32:12.040 --> 32:16.000\nI mean, you know, like, I just, you know, there's some things that you go out and, you\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:20.560\nknow, you do something and you're, you're like, I did that because it's a job or I,\n\n32:20.560 --> 32:25.560\nyou know, I do this and it, it went so far and it was great for that.\n\n32:25.560 --> 32:31.280\nBut then it just didn't go over that, that, that next step to get to out into the public\n\n32:31.280 --> 32:32.280\nor whatever.\n\n32:32.280 --> 32:33.760\nBut I feel the same too.\n\n32:33.760 --> 32:40.280\nIt's just like, I, you know, there's fake thresholds I thought that I would have crossed\n\n32:40.280 --> 32:46.960\nby now, but I'm just happy now to make a living, like doing, like, what I like.\n\n32:46.960 --> 32:52.480\nAnd that's, I'm in the very lucky percentage of people that get to do that.\n\n32:52.480 --> 33:01.280\nBut you're more artistic than I am, like you're, like, your book, like, but I, but I can't\n\n33:01.280 --> 33:02.280\ndo anything else.\n\n33:02.280 --> 33:05.800\nIt was like, you draw it and you don't even like it.\n\n33:05.800 --> 33:09.560\nYou draw because you have to, because what else are you going to fucking do?\n\n33:09.560 --> 33:10.560\nYeah.\n\n33:10.560 --> 33:11.560\nYeah.\n\n33:11.560 --> 33:14.760\nWell, that's how I think, I mean, there's, there's those two levels of, it's like, you\n\n33:14.760 --> 33:19.320\nand I have been on both tracks at various stages of, of our careers.\n\n33:19.320 --> 33:25.840\nThere's the track where there's all this artificial outside encouragement where people are calling\n\n33:25.840 --> 33:32.720\nand going, like, how'd you like to meet with Gwyneth Johnsonberg?\n\n33:32.720 --> 33:34.160\nAnd you're like, Gwyneth, okay.\n\n33:34.160 --> 33:40.080\nAnd then she's like, I want, I've always wanted, I've always been into slinkies and, and, and\n\n33:40.080 --> 33:44.520\nslinkies interested in, and, and then you, you, you get to get out of bed every day and\n\n33:44.520 --> 33:48.560\ngo like, well, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to fucking blow people's mind by making\n\n33:48.560 --> 33:49.560\nthis best slinky movie.\n\n33:49.560 --> 33:55.160\nAnd you have all these outside like things and it's like, it's like carbohydrates.\n\n33:55.160 --> 33:59.400\nLike it fills your blood sugar and then, and you, as long as you keep stuffing your face\n\n33:59.400 --> 34:03.160\nwith Snickers bars, you don't know that you're running on purely blood sugar.\n\n34:03.160 --> 34:07.680\nAnd then two, one of two things happened, you run out of Snickers and you get starving\n\n34:07.680 --> 34:12.520\nor you get really fat and you're also unhappy because you're working 50 jobs for Gwyneth\n\n34:12.520 --> 34:18.080\nJohnsonberg and slinky and none of them are passionate and that's like, again, you're\n\n34:18.080 --> 34:21.440\njust like, you just feel like you're, you're miserable.\n\n34:21.440 --> 34:25.640\nAnd then, then there's the Atkins diet of creativity. This is a bad metaphor because\n\n34:25.640 --> 34:33.120\nyou're vegetarian, but, but, but it's like, it's that other thing of like, you know, and,\n\n34:33.120 --> 34:38.920\nand, you know, like, like, like what Jeff had said, like, is this about, is this about\n\n34:38.920 --> 34:45.120\nprofession or is this about creative because they are, they can be two different things.\n\n34:45.120 --> 34:50.160\nAnd I think you're, you're, you're well aware of the fact that you don't want Robert DeNiro\n\n34:50.160 --> 34:55.720\nto drop through a skylight and be like, I, I want you to make a bullwinkle movie with\n\n34:55.720 --> 34:58.080\nme. Like that's not going to make you happy right now.\n\n34:58.080 --> 34:59.080\nNo.\n\n34:59.080 --> 35:05.880\nAnd, and you don't need it. And, and so it's like, I think it's like, it's the other things\n\n35:05.880 --> 35:10.440\nthat we're talking about. Like you feel like when Eddie Murphy went up at the House of\n\n35:10.440 --> 35:14.400\nBlues and started singing about how he didn't feel like he was funny anymore after Pluto\n\n35:14.400 --> 35:20.280\nand Ash or something, like you're feel, you're feeling midlife like creative crisis. Yeah.\n\n35:20.280 --> 35:28.160\nYou know, it's, it's, you know, it's like you get the, the phone calls from, you know,\n\n35:28.160 --> 35:32.840\nlike, Hey, there's a meeting. These people want to meet you. And you're just like, no,\n\n35:32.840 --> 35:40.840\nno, I don't, I don't want to. Well, why not? I just don't feel like driving to San Diego,\n\n35:40.840 --> 35:45.840\nbeing stuck in traffic for something that's a meet and greet that's just not going to\n\n35:45.840 --> 35:53.800\ngo anywhere or anywhere I want to, you know, to do the fucking Captain Crunch movie or,\n\n35:53.800 --> 35:58.200\nyou know, the electrician's a serial killer movie.\n\n35:58.200 --> 36:02.800\nAre you feeling Rob? Are you feeling more creative or less creative now? Do you do you\n\n36:02.800 --> 36:03.800\nfeel?\n\n36:03.800 --> 36:09.920\nI'm feeling dead. I'm feeling done. And it's, and it's hard because if it was just living\n\n36:09.920 --> 36:19.160\nalone, but I have my insecurities about my, my wife, who's younger than me, you know,\n\n36:19.160 --> 36:26.920\ngoing, I didn't sign up for this. I didn't sign up to live with a zombie. Well, I mean,\n\n36:26.920 --> 36:31.280\nthat goes back and forth. She'll, she'll be drawing checks from the account of your relationship\n\n36:31.280 --> 36:36.640\nat some point when she's feeling down. She, she loves you. She's not, she did sign up\n\n36:36.640 --> 36:43.720\nfor this. She, she doesn't, she didn't have a preconceived, like she didn't want you to\n\n36:43.720 --> 36:48.400\nbe energetic when she married you. She wasn't going, I've been with you for seven years,\n\n36:48.400 --> 36:53.520\nbut I like, I have this condition. I'm not sharing in my vows, which is that I want you\n\n36:53.520 --> 36:55.480\nto be bubbly every day.\n\n36:55.480 --> 37:00.880\nShe's a creator too. Like she makes stuff and also like she has to deal with her own\n\n37:00.880 --> 37:06.360\nlike ups and downs and the creative process. Like, like she doesn't work at a bakery. She\n\n37:06.360 --> 37:11.440\nalso wants to make things and she's a creator and you're, you're both dealing with the same.\n\n37:11.440 --> 37:16.760\nWe're going to get so many tweets from people at Dunkin Donuts and bakeries. Like they've\n\n37:16.760 --> 37:24.360\ntwice now been used as a, as an, as an example of people that have no point to, to live and\n\n37:24.360 --> 37:29.480\nare contributing nothing. I'm going to get that usual tweet from the fight for 15 minimum\n\n37:29.480 --> 37:35.480\nwage socialist people. Spencer, you, if I may, like you sent a pretty dark tweet out\n\n37:35.480 --> 37:39.400\ntoday where you said you wanted to die, you're done.\n\n37:39.400 --> 37:45.280\nThis is like playing prices, right? But it's like the price of life and the closer to zero\n\n37:45.280 --> 37:46.280\nyou get, you,\n\n37:46.280 --> 37:53.200\nOh, is it, was that a joke or a creative like, like desperation or just, or it was really\n\n37:53.200 --> 37:55.600\nfunny, right? It wasn't a hilarious, hilarious.\n\n37:55.600 --> 37:56.600\nWhat was it?\n\n37:56.600 --> 38:04.320\nThey're like, man, that is classic setup payoff. Oh boy. Yeah. No, I don't know. It was bad.\n\n38:04.320 --> 38:08.760\nI'm in a bad place. I, like I said, I feel like Rob does. I feel, I feel, I identify\n\n38:08.760 --> 38:12.520\nvery strongly with everything you're saying. I don't know. I had the thought that, and\n\n38:12.520 --> 38:16.920\nthis may or may not make any sense, but like the whole concept of a midlife crisis, it\n\n38:16.920 --> 38:22.520\nmight be like this biological, what do you call it? Reproduction instinct. Like, like\n\n38:22.520 --> 38:27.480\nafter you go so far, suddenly the light goes out of the world and it kind of becomes gray.\n\n38:27.480 --> 38:31.400\nAnd the reason it becomes gray is because then you can see the world fresh new color\n\n38:31.400 --> 38:36.120\nonce you have a kid. It kind of, basically it's like new game plus on the world and\n\n38:36.120 --> 38:40.560\nit kind of just changes your perspective and lets you kind of become comfortable with the\n\n38:40.560 --> 38:44.600\nidea of it's not about my happiness. It's not about me being the protagonist in the\n\n38:44.600 --> 38:49.320\nworld. It's about being part of this community that is then putting forth new people that\n\n38:49.320 --> 38:50.320\nare then the new.\n\n38:50.320 --> 38:55.320\nYou're looking at things that are going to stale through fresh eyes. It's like when\n\n38:55.320 --> 38:59.880\nyou're a fan of like, say, Star Trek or Dungeons and Dragons and you're teaching somebody who's\n\n38:59.880 --> 39:04.480\nnever done it before, it's boom. It's just like, so you have a kid and you go, this\n\n39:04.480 --> 39:06.680\nis Christmas, this is Easter, this is fun.\n\n39:06.680 --> 39:10.640\nYou've got a whole new life. It's like the second chapter, like it's everything about\n\n39:10.640 --> 39:12.840\nyour life you get to redo over.\n\n39:12.840 --> 39:18.080\nBut I've been having midlife crisis sees my entire life.\n\n39:18.080 --> 39:20.880\nYeah, but humans used to live until 30, right?\n\n39:20.880 --> 39:22.600\nYou've gone through a lot of midlives, yeah.\n\n39:22.600 --> 39:23.600\nYes.\n\n39:23.600 --> 39:25.000\nYou're like the cat of middle age.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:26.000\nYes.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:33.480\nYeah, I think it has something to do with, I think, a typical Dunkin' Donuts of shit\n\n39:33.480 --> 39:34.880\neating bakery worker.\n\n39:34.880 --> 39:35.880\nOkay.\n\n39:35.880 --> 39:43.600\nDan, let's lay off the donuts for a while.\n\n39:43.600 --> 39:48.360\nTime Magazine can identify one midlife and one midlife crisis and creatives are constantly\n\n39:48.360 --> 39:54.320\ndying and resurrecting in their minds. I think that you guys are hitting the nail on the\n\n39:54.320 --> 39:56.960\nhead because it all has to do with the future.\n\n39:56.960 --> 40:02.960\nWhen you're 25, you don't really realize that what's keeping you going is thinking unconsciously\n\n40:02.960 --> 40:09.640\nabout how life's going to be when you're 35.\n\n40:09.640 --> 40:14.880\nThat energy just permeates you even though if anyone asked you and you consciously answered\n\n40:14.880 --> 40:20.560\nthe question, like, so what's it like being so young and like having your whole life ahead\n\n40:20.560 --> 40:26.520\nof you, we were all there. We would grouse and be like, what do you mean, my whole life?\n\n40:26.520 --> 40:32.360\nI should have done something by the time I was 21, blah, blah, blah, and also even if\n\n40:32.360 --> 40:36.120\nyou were an optimistic person, you'd be like, look, I'm not a materialist, so I don't care\n\n40:36.120 --> 40:40.320\nabout the future. I don't care what's going to happen. I'm not thinking about that. And\n\n40:40.320 --> 40:46.600\nyou'd pass a polygraph test, but when you get to 35, you then start to realize that\n\n40:46.600 --> 40:54.960\nyou, oh, there's some tank that's emptying here and I can't quite put my finger on it.\n\n40:54.960 --> 41:01.080\nAnd then you get to 45 and you're like, aha, I know what that tank is. That tank is thinking\n\n41:01.080 --> 41:06.440\nabout the future. It is just the idea of the future.\n\n41:06.440 --> 41:11.120\nBut here's the glorious invitation that that represents because this isn't an epiphany\n\n41:11.120 --> 41:15.760\nwe're having when we're 70, which would be fine to have it then, like, unforgiven. We\n\n41:15.760 --> 41:20.840\ncould take a shotgun into town and just blow everyone away in the rain. But to have it\n\n41:20.840 --> 41:28.280\nwhen you're truly middle-aged is to truly say, oh, my thought about the future tank\n\n41:28.280 --> 41:35.440\nis empty. That's a good tank to be empty. It's like going into ketosis and I'm now going\n\n41:35.440 --> 41:39.600\nto have to actually live off of the moment. And Jeff is saying that in one way. He's an\n\n41:39.600 --> 41:47.120\nactor. He's going like, he broke through to, I'm just a wandering minstrel and I found\n\n41:47.120 --> 41:52.520\njoy in like, send me on a plane to India, send me here, as long as I'm always working\n\n41:52.520 --> 41:56.160\nwith people that I love and I'm getting paid to do what I love and I don't have to work\n\n41:56.160 --> 42:01.440\nin a shit-hole bakery with the fucking disgusting bakers.\n\n42:01.440 --> 42:05.120\nWe're talking to you, Duncan Donuts. We're talking to you, bakers of America,\n\n42:05.120 --> 42:12.960\nyou gross fucking yeast shit. Who wants to be a fucking baker? You disgusting\n\n42:12.960 --> 42:20.440\nmilk-fed fucking 90 IQ donut wranglers. You tell me what yeast even is, bakers, and\n\n42:20.440 --> 42:25.680\nI'll fucking give you a donut. I'll tell you what's not rising. Your life,\n\n42:25.680 --> 42:31.600\nyou pieces of shit. And there will be no comeuppance for this. There will never be\n\n42:31.600 --> 42:38.200\na working class revolution in this country. We should keep saying that. I think that might\n\n42:38.200 --> 42:42.560\nbe a good idea. They're like just angrily. They'll never, like just in public, there\n\n42:42.560 --> 42:48.400\nwill never be a working class uprising. Just get enough people to say that. All these teenagers\n\n42:48.400 --> 42:53.840\nare like, what the fuck does this guy know? We're going to fucking riot. I think that\n\n42:53.840 --> 42:58.440\ncould work. I mean, it's a joke. You're the guy Fox of not having a mask.\n\n42:58.440 --> 43:09.240\nAnyways, but I mean, that's what we need to get through to, is just that I'm waking\n\n43:09.240 --> 43:15.560\nup and there's a depressing way of saying it, that you're waking up and there's nothing.\n\n43:15.560 --> 43:20.120\nAnd then there's also a really, you know. No, there's definitely a way that you could\n\n43:20.120 --> 43:26.680\ngo, you know, oh man. This is heaven. The things that I've always wanted to do, I've\n\n43:26.680 --> 43:33.920\ndone, and I'm kind of sick of it. You know, I'm kind of sick of my own shit, you know.\n\n43:33.920 --> 43:40.040\nBut at the same time, I could go, but now's the time to change. You know, now's the time\n\n43:40.040 --> 43:43.840\nto do something different. Now's the time to invent a new style.\n\n43:43.840 --> 43:49.040\nI'll tell you something you've always had over me is, like, I've never had the balls\n\n43:49.040 --> 43:55.400\nto say no to the Clifford, the big red dog meeting or the so-and-so wants to meet you.\n\n43:55.400 --> 44:01.240\nI'm all, I can't shake this terror, but I need to. It's being forced upon me that I\n\n44:01.240 --> 44:06.520\nneed to because I've done nothing but, you know, spread myself thin and botch a bunch\n\n44:06.520 --> 44:16.720\nof projects. Like, I need to just say no thank you to the Jenga phone call, the Jenga movie.\n\n44:16.720 --> 44:20.640\nBut instead, I just keep going, like, well, do you think he'll set it in the future and\n\n44:20.640 --> 44:25.400\ntaking that call? And then, of course, he says yes, but he's lying, you know. Like,\n\n44:25.400 --> 44:30.480\nif you go into the fucking Jenga office and, you know, in Sino, and-\n\n44:30.480 --> 44:31.480\nI just, I just, I-\n\n44:31.480 --> 44:34.840\nIs it a riff or is it actually a Jenga?\n\n44:34.840 --> 44:36.000\nIt's based in truth.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:46.680\nI can't, I can't, it's so hard to do anything creative, for me, that I can't do it unless\n\n44:46.680 --> 44:51.560\nI love it. And I gotta figure out a way to love it. If I can figure out a way to love\n\n44:51.560 --> 44:59.360\nit, I'll do it. But if I can't, I'm like, I'm waiting everybody's time. So, yeah, I\n\n44:59.360 --> 45:05.840\ndon't work as often as I probably could, and I could have a bigger savings account than\n\n45:05.840 --> 45:13.120\nI do, but I just kind of, I do what I, whatever I want, you know. And right now, I'm like in\n\n45:13.120 --> 45:18.640\na scary place because I, you know, this is what depression feels like, is like, I don't\n\n45:18.640 --> 45:24.560\nwant to do anything ever again, and I feel like it's gonna be ever again. And then, eventually,\n\n45:24.560 --> 45:29.080\nmy wife's gonna leave me, my dog's gonna die, I'm gonna have a no savings account, and you're\n\n45:29.080 --> 45:33.280\njust gonna bury me in that apartment that I've been living in for the last 20 years,\n\n45:33.280 --> 45:35.040\nbecause I'm afraid to move out.\n\n45:35.040 --> 45:39.360\nHmm. Maybe you'll feel better if I do a rap. Hit it.\n\n45:39.360 --> 45:42.000\nZach, you gotta be-\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:48.880\nBelmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont-\n\n45:48.880 --> 45:49.840\nYo, a Russian,\n\n45:49.840 --> 45:54.560\nBelmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, Belmont, and Belmont walk into a-\n\n45:54.560 --> 45:55.880\nI got in a canoe,\n\n45:55.880 --> 46:01.120\nI rode it to your house, and I got out my shoe, and I, I squatted over it, and I took a poo,\n\n46:01.120 --> 46:06.280\nand then I had a shoe filled with poo in my canoe, and I gave it to you, and you said,\n\n46:06.280 --> 46:11.880\nwhat you gonna do, and I said, I'm gonna take another poo in my canoe, and I threw my shoe,\n\n46:11.880 --> 46:17.220\nAnd it went over there, and I saw your mama with her bright red hair, and I said,\n\n46:17.220 --> 46:19.820\nGoddamn!\n\n46:19.820 --> 46:21.320\nPoo-ka-noo!\n\n46:21.320 --> 46:22.820\nUndercats!\n\n46:22.820 --> 46:25.820\nIt's a

bare leotard.\n\n46:37.520 --> 46:40.120\nI'm flashing back to ten years old.\n\n46:40.120 --> 46:42.120\nAlright, get away from that area.\n\n46:42.120 --> 46:44.120\nTricky, bad area.\n\n46:44.120

47:55.120\nYeah, yeah, okay, good.\n\n47:55.120 --> 47:57.120\nLet's pump those bakers back up.\n\n47:57.120 --> 47:59.120\nYo, yo.\n\n47:59.120 --> 48:01.120\nI wake up in the morning and I make the dough.\n\n48:01.120 --> 48:04.120\nI gotta roll it all around like the shit with snow.\n\n48:04.120 --> 48:07.120\nAnd I'm not making a man and I'm not making an igloo.\n\n48:07.120 --> 48:11.120\nI'm making things that you need to eat to do what you do.\n\n48:11.120 --> 48:15.120\nSo you do to thank me for giving you fuel\n\n48:15.120 --> 48:17.120\nso you can go off on your spankings\n\n48:17.120 --> 48:19.120\nbecause you're a professional spanker\n\n48:19.120 --> 48:22.120\nor you're a carpenter or you're a banker.\n\n48:22.120 --> 48:25.120\nI'm just a lowly donut maker\n\n48:25.120 --> 48:28.120\nbut you shit down on me because shit rolls downhill.\n\n48:28.120 --> 48:30.120\nOh, fuck you.\n\n48:30.120 --> 48:32.120\nI'm sorry, I'm not Dr. Phil.\n\n48:32.120 --> 48:33.120\nWhy is he so great?\n\n48:33.120 --> 48:34.120\nYou hate him.\n\n48:34.120 --> 48:37.120\nSo what, what, what do you work at a gym?\n\n48:37.120 --> 48:39.120\nLike, I make fucking donuts.\n\n48:39.120 --> 48:41.120\nNo, you just make the opposite of them by working at a gym\n\n48:41.120 --> 48:42.120\nif you think about it.\n\n48:42.120 --> 48:44.120\nIt's a weird cycle.\n\n48:44.120 --> 48:46.120\nI make the donuts and then you go to the gym\n\n48:46.120 --> 48:51.120\nand then you make the donuts come out of your body.\n\n48:51.120 --> 48:58.120\nYo.\n\n48:58.120 --> 48:59.120\nThunder cats.\n\n48:59.120 --> 49:01.120\nOh.\n\n49:01.120 --> 49:03.120\nThunder cats rap.\n\n49:03.120 --> 49:05.120\nThunder cats rap.\n\n49:05.120 --> 49:07.120\nLord of Omens, give me sight beyond sight.\n\n49:07.120 --> 49:10.120\nI fucked your mama so hard that I made it less tight\n\n49:10.120 --> 49:13.120\nthat I found Snark and said, what are you doing?\n\n49:13.120 --> 49:15.120\nAnd he said, Snarf.\n\n49:15.120 --> 49:18.120\nAnd I said, I'm sorry, I got your name wrong.\n\n49:18.120 --> 49:20.120\nPantera.\n\n49:20.120 --> 49:21.120\nPantera.\n\n49:21.120 --> 49:23.120\nWas uncomfortable.\n\n49:23.120 --> 49:24.120\nThat was good.\n\n49:24.120 --> 49:25.120\nAll right.\n\n49:25.120 --> 49:26.120\nThat was good.\n\n49:26.120 --> 49:27.120\nThat was a good one.\n\n49:27.120 --> 49:29.120\nI feel, I feel bad.\n\n49:29.120 --> 49:32.120\nRob, do you feel, do you feel more activated as a creator now\n\n49:32.120 --> 49:33.120\nafter that?\n\n49:33.120 --> 49:34.120\nI think so.\n\n49:34.120 --> 49:36.120\nI mean, I thought maybe there would be some.\n\n49:36.120 --> 49:37.120\nI think so.\n\n49:37.120 --> 49:41.120\nI thought maybe if I stirred the pot a little bit\n\n49:41.120 --> 49:44.120\nthere would be some creative energies.\n\n49:44.120 --> 49:47.120\nLike maybe we would go, oh yeah, we should talk about\n\n49:47.120 --> 49:48.120\nThunder cats.\n\n49:48.120 --> 49:50.120\nWhat was going on in that cartoon?\n\n49:50.120 --> 49:57.120\nUm, I think Pantera and Chitara were an item.\n\n49:57.120 --> 49:59.120\nI don't think, I think they were keeping it quiet\n\n49:59.120 --> 50:01.120\nbecause the kids were around.\n\n50:01.120 --> 50:03.120\nBut they would, they would always kind of like,\n\n50:03.120 --> 50:06.120\nbecause WilyKit and WilyKat were always around too much\n\n50:06.120 --> 50:09.120\nand you know that Pantera, if he had his moment.\n\n50:09.120 --> 50:10.120\nI said Pantera.\n\n50:10.120 --> 50:11.120\nYeah.\n\n50:11.120 --> 50:12.120\nPantera is a band.\n\n50:12.120 --> 50:14.120\nI can't believe I've lost all of the Thunder cat.\n\n50:14.120 --> 50:15.120\nI'm losing my Thunder cats.\n\n50:15.120 --> 50:17.120\nName all of the Thunder cats.\n\n50:17.120 --> 50:18.120\nLionel.\n\n50:18.120 --> 50:19.120\nLionel.\n\n50:19.120 --> 50:20.120\nLionel.\n\n50:20.120 -->

so.\n\n50:33.120 --> 50:34.120\nTigro?\n\n50:34.120 --> 50:35.120\nLettigra?\n\n50:35.120 --> 50:37.120\nLettigra was a rat man.\n\n50:37.120 --> 50:38.120\nThere was a fucking tiger.\n\n50:38.120 --> 50:39.120\nWhat was his name?\n\n50:39.120 --> 50:41.120\nShroeder.\n\n50:41.120 --> 50:42.120\nOh.\n\n50:42.120 --> 50:43.120\nShroeder.\n\n50:43.120 --> 50:44.120\nWhat was the tiger?\n\n50:44.120

50:51.120\nWe're not high-roading you by thinking you're wrong.\n\n50:51.120 --> 50:52.120\nTigro.\n\n50:52.120 --> 50:53.120\nOkay.\n\n50:53.120 --> 50:56.120\nAnd the animal.\n\n50:56.120 -->

51:01.120\nAnd what are the kids?\n\n51:01.120 --> 51:02.120\nWhitful and whenful.\n\n51:02.120 --> 51:03.120\nNo, no, no.\n\n51:03.120 --> 51:05.120\nI forgot they were kids.\n\n51:05.120 -->

Smurfs.\n\n51:45.120 --> 51:47.120\nThese are great Smurfs.\n\n51:47.120 --> 51:48.120\nNo one updated.\n\n51:48.120 --> 51:51.120\nThey didn't update the Smurfs properly.\n\n51:51.120 --> 51:52.120\nLibtard.\n\n51:52.120 --> 51:53.120\nLibtard.\n\n51:53.120 --> 51:54.120\nCuck holds.\n\n51:54.120 --> 52:00.120\nYou know that Brainy Smurf would be super a snowflake Smurf.\n\n52:00.120

Smurf.\n\n52:23.120 --> 52:25.120\nThe only Smurf for you.\n\n52:25.120 --> 52:26.120\nPapa.\n\n52:26.120 --> 52:27.120\nPapa.\n\n52:27.120 --> 52:28.120\nThat's obvious.\n\n52:28.120 -->

pencil?\n\n52:33.120 --> 52:34.120\nNo, that was the Brainy.\n\n52:34.120 --> 52:35.120\nOh.\n\n52:35.120 --> 52:38.120\nHandy Smurf was like, he was basically Andy on WKRP.\n\n52:38.120 --> 52:40.120\nThat's how I remember him.\n\n52:40.120 --> 52:41.120\nThat's a deep cut.\n\n52:41.120 --> 52:42.120\nHefty Smurf.\n\n52:42.120 --> 52:44.120\nHefty is one for sure.\n\n52:44.120 --> 52:45.120\nHefty Smurf.\n\n52:45.120 --> 52:46.120\nHefty?\n\n52:46.120 --> 52:48.120\nThe only Smurf for you is one who has true blue.\n\n52:48.120 --> 52:49.120\nThat Smurf is me.\n\n52:49.120 --> 52:50.120\nMy name is Hefty.\n\n52:50.120 --> 52:51.120\nThis is not a real Smurf.\n\n52:51.120 --> 52:53.120\nThey were all writing songs.\n\n52:53.120 --> 52:58.120\nWhat fucking Israeli Smurf ripoff did you grow up on?\n\n52:58.120 --> 53:04.120\nThey were all trying to woo Smurfette in one episode, and they all wrote songs or did\n\n53:04.120 --> 53:05.120\nthings.\n\n53:05.120 --> 53:07.120\nI don't remember Hefty at all.\n\n53:07.120 --> 53:11.120\nI will eat my fucking potato chip hat if Hefty Smurf is not a real Smurf.\n\n53:11.120 --> 53:15.120\nWell, I doubt you'd lie about it or get it wrong.\n\n53:15.120 --> 53:16.120\nHefty Smurf is the same.\n\n53:16.120 --> 53:17.120\nIs he big?\n\n53:17.120 --> 53:18.120\nIs he big and strong?\n\n53:18.120 --> 53:19.120\nHe's the Hefty Smurf.\n\n53:19.120 --> 53:20.120\nHe's good looking.\n\n53:20.120 --> 53:21.120\nYeah.\n\n53:21.120 --> 53:22.120\nHe's the macho Smurf.\n\n53:22.120 --> 53:23.120\nUnlike Vanity.\n\n53:23.120 --> 53:26.120\nVanity had flowers and talked with an English accent.\n\n53:26.120 --> 53:30.120\nAnd he always had a handheld mirror with him at all times.\n\n53:30.120 --> 53:36.120\nVanity was ginger from Gilligan's Island, but then you got handy and brainy.\n\n53:36.120 --> 53:37.120\nIt's like you split your professor.\n\n53:37.120 --> 53:38.120\nYeah.\n\n53:38.120 --> 53:39.120\nIf he's so handy, why is he got the pencil?\n\n53:39.120 --> 53:43.120\nHe had the pencil behind the ears and the slide rule, and he knew how to make shit.\n\n53:43.120 --> 53:44.120\nOut of mushrooms.\n\n53:44.120 --> 53:47.120\nBut Brainy knew how to not make shit.\n\n53:47.120 --> 53:51.120\nBrainy just stand over a handy shoulder and go, like, you shouldn't do that.\n\n53:51.120 --> 53:53.120\nBrainy's like, this needs aerodynamics.\n\n53:53.120 --> 53:54.120\nGargamel's cat.\n\n53:54.120 --> 53:55.120\nBecause air falls.\n\n53:55.120 --> 53:56.120\nAsriel.\n\n53:56.120 --> 53:57.120\nOh, shit.\n\n53:57.120 --> 53:58.120\nHe fucking got it.\n\n53:58.120 --> 53:59.120\nHe got it.\n\n53:59.120 --> 54:00.120\nDrop it.\n\n54:00.120 --> 54:01.120\nDrop it.\n\n54:01.120 --> 54:02.120\nWhat did he do?\n\n54:02.120 --> 54:03.120\nThat was the cat?\n\n54:03.120 --> 54:05.120\nI asked, what was the name of Gargamel's cat?\n\n54:05.120 --> 54:06.120\nAnd he got it.\n\n54:06.120 --> 54:07.120\nAsriel.\n\n54:07.120 --> 54:08.120\nAsriel.\n\n54:08.120 --> 54:09.120\nOkay.\n\n54:09.120 --> 54:11.120\nSo the Coleco vision came with Smurf, the video game.\n\n54:11.120 --> 54:16.120\nBy the way, if you're a subscriber, and you're under 50, goodbye.\n\n54:16.120 --> 54:20.120\nAnd I say that with no hate for you or us.\n\n54:20.120 --> 54:21.120\nI'm happy.\n\n54:21.120 --> 54:29.120\nAnd if you're not, type Coleco vision into Google search and whatever.\n\n54:29.120 --> 54:32.120\nWhat was the game play on the Smurf?\n\n54:32.120 --> 54:34.120\nLet me tell you something.\n\n54:34.120 --> 54:37.120\nHardest fucking game ever.\n\n54:37.120 --> 54:43.120\nI remember Christmas morning, we got the Coleco vision, and we were shitting our pants because\n\n54:43.120 --> 54:45.120\nit was like real arcade graphics.\n\n54:45.120 --> 54:46.120\nYeah.\n\n54:46.120 --> 54:47.120\nIn your home.\n\n54:47.120 --> 54:49.120\nColeco was like pharmaceutical cocaine.\n\n54:49.120 --> 54:50.120\nYeah.\n\n54:50.120 --> 54:51.120\nIt was fucking amazing.\n\n54:51.120 --> 54:52.120\n16 bits.\n\n54:52.120 --> 54:54.120\nRamstack had a Coleco.\n\n54:54.120 --> 54:55.120\nIt's good, right?\n\n54:55.120 --> 54:56.120\nNobody else had a Coleco.\n\n54:56.120 --> 54:57.120\nRamstack had a Coleco.\n\n54:57.120 --> 54:59.120\nWe put in Smurf.\n\n54:59.120 --> 55:01.120\nWe put in Smurf.\n\n55:01.120 --> 55:03.120\nCouldn't get past the first screen.\n\n55:03.120 --> 55:04.120\nWhat was the game play?\n\n55:04.120 --> 55:05.120\nWho are you?\n\n55:05.120 --> 55:11.120\nYou're a Smurf trying to get Smurf fed out of Gargamel's crib.\n\n55:11.120 --> 55:18.120\nIt's a scrolling game, it starts out mushroom on one side of the frame, a fence on the other.\n\n55:18.120 --> 55:22.120\nAnd it would go do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.\n\n55:22.120 --> 55:26.120\nAnd you would have to jump over the fence.\n\n55:26.120 --> 55:32.120\nAnd with those fucking weird ass Coleco vision joysticks, which was like a knob.\n\n55:32.120 --> 55:33.120\nDid you use the numpad?\n\n55:33.120 --> 55:34.120\nOn a phone pad.\n\n55:34.120 --> 55:35.120\nYeah.\n\n55:35.120 --> 55:37.120\nWhich was like, what the hell?\n\n55:37.120 --> 55:39.120\nWhat am I supposed to do with this?\n\n55:39.120 --> 55:46.120\nYou're supposed to jump and move at the same time, which was almost impossible.\n\n55:46.120 --> 55:55.120\nSo we're trying to do this and we're trying to jump over the fence of the first screen.\n\n55:55.120 --> 55:58.120\nAnd Jeff, Steven, me, we couldn't do it.\n\n55:58.120 --> 55:59.120\nWe couldn't do it.\n\n55:59.120 --> 56:00.120\nThose are the Schrab Brothers.\n\n56:00.120 --> 56:03.120\nWe're doing it for hours and hours and hours.\n\n56:03.120 --> 56:04.120\nWe could do it.\n\n56:04.120 --> 56:06.120\nAnd all three of us are crying.\n\n56:06.120 --> 56:09.120\nWe're screen crying.\n\n56:09.120 --> 56:14.120\nAnd David and Donna Schrab, my parents are going, it's just, you know, it's just a really hard game.\n\n56:14.120 --> 56:17.120\nYou got to practice it, but it's not even fun.\n\n56:17.120 --> 56:23.120\nOr that quote that made me want to murder my whole family and burn the house down.\n\n56:23.120 --> 56:24.120\nIf it makes you that angry.\n\n56:24.120 --> 56:25.120\nYeah, if it makes it.\n\n56:25.120 --> 56:29.120\nIt's just like after the third time that you go, God damn it.\n\n56:29.120 --> 56:35.120\nAnd you just hear from the kitchen, if it makes you that angry, why do you keep playing it?\n\n56:35.120 --> 56:41.120\nAnd I remember mom, I want to talk to you about your marriage.\n\n56:41.120 --> 56:43.120\nWell, that's the thing.\n\n56:43.120 --> 56:47.120\nIt's like, yeah, I guess a game you haven't passed the first level on.\n\n56:47.120 --> 56:51.120\nLet's apply that to just real life instead of games.\n\n56:51.120 --> 56:55.120\nYeah, I just wanted to take a dig that would put my rift in my family.\n\n56:55.120 --> 56:57.120\nBack in the days when I was, I'm kidding, mom.\n\n56:57.120 --> 57:03.120\nI think on the off chance, my mom likes me enough now to just watching this and that would, mom, I'm doing a joke.\n\n57:03.120 --> 57:05.120\nWhat was the video game?\n\n57:05.120 --> 57:07.120\nDragon's Lair?\n\n57:07.120 --> 57:09.120\nRight, Dragon's Lair?\n\n57:09.120 --> 57:10.120\nSpace Ace and Dragon's Lair.\n\n57:10.120 --> 57:12.120\nYou can get Space Ace and Dragon's Lair.\n\n57:12.120 --> 57:14.120\nIt was $0.50 or $1 to play it.\n\n57:14.120 --> 57:17.120\nAnd you couldn't get through fucking 15 seconds.\n\n57:17.120 --> 57:22.120\nBecause you're watching a cartoon, a Don Bluth cartoon, and just having to memorize when to put it down.\n\n57:22.120 --> 57:32.120\nIt was basically a DVD remote control, and you weren't going chapter searching with this fucking piece of shit.\n\n57:32.120 --> 57:33.120\nSame thing with Donkey Kong.\n\n57:33.120 --> 57:35.120\nDonkey Kong is a memorization game.\n\n57:35.120 --> 57:37.120\nIt's all about memorizing it.\n\n57:37.120 --> 57:39.120\nAnd jumping barrels.\n\n57:39.120 --> 57:40.120\nHell yeah.\n\n57:40.120 --> 57:44.120\nDo you guys remember when DVDs first came out?\n\n57:44.120 --> 57:48.120\nThat was the most important high five in podcast history.\n\n57:48.120 --> 57:52.120\nThe three year period during which the porn industry ever forward.\n\n57:52.120 --> 57:56.120\nIt's written on the porn industry's seal in Latin.\n\n57:56.120 --> 57:58.120\nEver, ever forward.\n\n57:58.120 --> 58:03.120\nWhat's that French quote about audacity?\n\n58:03.120 --> 58:07.120\nThat's the French.\n\n58:07.120 --> 58:09.120\nAlways forward.\n\n58:09.120 --> 58:17.120\nDVDs hadn't been in existence for a year and wouldn't have been if it weren't for the porn industry.\n\n58:17.120 --> 58:21.120\nAnd then also at the same time, you would get a porn on DVD.\n\n58:21.120 --> 58:26.120\nAnd the menu would always include sex game.\n\n58:26.120 --> 58:28.120\nAnd you'd be like, what?\n\n58:28.120 --> 58:32.120\nAnd then it would be like this fucking hallway.\n\n58:32.120 --> 58:34.120\nLike Wolfenstein graphic.\n\n58:34.120 --> 58:38.120\nAnd it would be like this weird, it's just playing a video of a hallway.\n\n58:38.120 --> 58:41.120\nAnd you're supposed to just use the tracks.\n\n58:41.120 --> 58:45.120\nWhat do you think they came here for?\n\n58:45.120 --> 58:48.120\nWhat do you think we came to Space Station 69 for?\n\n58:48.120 --> 58:51.120\nGo down a hallway and turn left and open a door.\n\n58:51.120 --> 58:53.120\nAnd there's a pussy.\n\n58:53.120 --> 58:56.120\nAnd then you click on the pussy and it's just a video clip.\n\n58:56.120 --> 58:57.120\nYou know what?\n\n58:57.120 --> 59:01.120\nJerking off wasn't fun until you guys added hallways.\n\n59:01.120 --> 59:03.120\nBut you can't blame them.\n\n59:03.120 --> 59:05.120\nYou can't blame porn for being a...\n\n59:05.120 --> 59:06.120\nTrying.\n\n59:06.120 --> 59:10.120\nPorn is like the head of North Korea.\n\n59:10.120 --> 59:11.120\nIt's a Kim Jong-un.\n\n59:11.120 --> 59:13.120\nI can't remember which one we're on.\n\n59:13.120 --> 59:16.120\nBut it's like that thing of like you're a paranoid...\n\n59:16.120 --> 59:18.120\nPorn is a paranoid dictator.\n\n59:18.120 --> 59:22.120\nIt knows that if it lets it's guard down for a second, it will be assassinated.\n\n59:22.120 --> 59:27.120\nWe will figure out a way to do away with porn if porn doesn't stay relevant.\n\n59:27.120 --> 59:28.120\nIt's just like such a...\n\n59:28.120 --> 59:31.120\nAnd so it's always out there just like nervous and sweaty.\n\n59:31.120 --> 59:33.120\nLike a...\n\n59:33.120 --> 59:36.120\nLike a banana peel on Ron Jeremy's shoulder.\n\n59:36.120 --> 59:38.120\nIt's a...\n\n59:38.120 --> 59:41.120\nThe guy in Casablanca, the actor who's sweaty is...\n\n59:41.120 --> 59:42.120\nOh, Rick.\n\n59:42.120 --> 59:43.120\nI don't know.\n\n59:43.120 --> 59:44.120\nBogart.\n\n59:44.120 --> 59:45.120\nNo, the other guy.\n\n59:45.120 --> 59:47.120\nThe guy who sounds like Ren.\n\n59:47.120 --> 59:48.120\nPeter Lorre.\n\n59:48.120 --> 59:49.120\nPeter Lorre.\n\n59:49.120 --> 59:51.120\nPorn has the personality of Peter Lorre.\n\n59:51.120 --> 59:52.120\nThis is always...\n\n59:52.120 --> 59:53.120\nRick.\n\n59:53.120 --> 59:54.120\nRick.\n\n59:54.120 --> 59:55.120\nYou want to jerk off.\n\n59:55.120 --> 59:59.120\nNow that DVDs are up, maybe Rick, we should maybe make an interactive kind of porn.\n\n59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.120\nRick, huh?\n\n01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.120\nAnd the American viewer is just like, hey, why don't you take it easy?\n\n01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.120\nSee, sweetheart, I guess.\n\n01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.120\nI'll jerk off when I want to jerk off.\n\n01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.120\nBut Rick, that's not going to keep me alive, Rick.\n\n01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.120\nNow do Ingrid Bergman.\n\n01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.120\nI want you to be a porn version.\n\n01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.120\nI want you to be a porn hub of all of these characters.\n\n01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.120\nIt's not a tumor.\n\n01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.120\nThat's not a tumor.\n\n01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.120\nThat's a good Ingrid Bergman.\n\n01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.120\nI don't know what Ingrid Bergman sounds like.\n\n01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.120\nDo Sidney Greenstreet.\n\n01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.120\nYou must remember this.\n\n01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.120\nA kiss of...\n\n01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:35.120\nHe's not even in that movie.\n\n01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.120\nI don't know if racism is the crime that's committed there.\n\n01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.120\nIf anything, lack of racism.\n\n01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.120\nIf I could confuse the piano.\n\n01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.120\nSam for Sidney Greenstreet.\n\n01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.120\nI think I'm post-racial.\n\n01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.120\nLouis Armstrong was Sam in that movie.\n\n01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120\nHave you ever seen the movie?\n\n01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.120\nIt's a good movie.\n\n01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.120\nCasablanca?\n\n01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.120\nI don't think I've seen it.\n\n01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.120\nDid you know there was an alternate ending to it?\n\n01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.120\nThey changed the ending?\n\n01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.120\nZip.\n\n01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.120\nThey kind of riffed it at the end.\n\n01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:10.120\nDo you want to riff another ending to Casablanca right now?\n\n01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:16.120\nSo Victor Laszlo and Ingrid Bergman, whatever her name is, Elsa.\n\n01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.120\nThey got on the plane.\n\n01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.120\nSo you got Claude Reigns and Humphrey Bogart.\n\n01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:27.120\nAnd Humphrey Bogart and Claude Reigns are in a sticky situation.\n\n01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:31.120\nBecause each of them have been kind of traitors to their own laws.\n\n01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.120\nSo you'd be Claude Reigns.\n\n01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.120\nOkay.\n\n01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:40.120\nIt seems, Rick, that we are in a bad situation.\n\n01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.120\nYou have to kill me or I have to arrest you.\n\n01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:52.120\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:57.120\nLieutenant.\n\n01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:05.120\nYou know, there comes a time in a man's life when he needs to...\n\n01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.120\nSorry, I have to take this call.\n\n01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120\nTelephone!\n\n01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:14.120\nThank you, Lieutenant Schwartz.\n\n01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.120\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.120\nHe just stole my pen.\n\n01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.120\nIf you're both lieutenants, how does he know to bring you the phone?\n\n01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.120\nWell, then that's where you have me, Rick.\n\n01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.120\nSorry, I didn't mean to...\n\n01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.120\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.120\nTelephone!\n\n01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.120\nOh, now I got handed a phone.\n\n01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:39.120\nMaybe I'm a lieutenant too, sweetheart.\n\n01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.120\nTelephone!\n\n01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.120\nThat was for you.\n\n01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120\nHello.\n\n01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.120\nHello, sweetheart.\n\n01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120\nHello.\n\n01:02:51.120 -->

a far away from America.\n\n01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:08.120\nNew Jersey is from Hoboken, which isn't that far.\n\n01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120\nSee?\n\n01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:12.120\nHey, hey, hey,

phone?\n\n01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.120\nShut up, John.\n\n01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.120\nPeter Lloyd's still alive.\n\n01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.120\nHe didn't get killed in jail.\n\n01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.120\nHe got arrested by the Gestapo, but he's still alive.\n\n01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.120\nWho was on your phone?\n\n01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.520\nI was talking to the Vichy general\n\n01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.840\nof the local police department.\n\n01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.180\nBrrr, uh-oh.\n\n01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.000\nTelephone.\n\n01:03:44.000 -->

sweetheart.\n\n01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.040\nBut we'll always have Paris, but you forgot my name.\n\n01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.480\nYou know how to say my name, don't you, sweetheart?\n\n01:04:18.480

01:05:02.460\nHello?\n\n01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.840\nSnarf, snarf, snarf.\n\n01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.640\nOh, snarf, man.\n\n01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.800\nLet me put you on the phone with Chetaro\n\n01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.920\nby turning the phone.\n\n01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.560\nHey, where's Lionel?\n\n01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.040\nSnarf, snarf.\n\n01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.800\nOh, he's in the kitchen.\n\n01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.080\nSnarf.\n\n01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.880\nI'm going to go get him.\n\n01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.360\nCan I get you anything?\n\n01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.160\nI can't remember the name of the movie\n\n01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.280\nwhere he says put your lips together and blow\n\n01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.640\nwith Lauren Bacall.\n\n01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.560\nOh, let me ask.\n\n01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.200\nIs that Key Largo?\n\n01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.040\nNo, it's not Key Largo.\n\n01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.880\nThat was with, what's his fucking name?\n\n01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.600\nBigSleep.\n\n01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.840\nNo, that's a BigSleep.\n\n01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.880\nMaltese.\n\n01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.720\nNot the Maltese.\n\n01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.440\nDance dancer in the dark.\n\n01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.280\nSnarf, snarf.\n\n01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:44.200\nHey, Lionel, what was the name of the movie\n\n01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:49.280\nwhere they say put your lips together and blow?\n\n01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.480\nLionel's not on your call, sweetheart.\n\n01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.760\nHe's in the kitchen.\n\n01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.640\nOh.\n\n01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.440\nOh.\n\n01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.360\nNever mind.\n\n01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:55.860\nHold on.\n\n01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.360\nFuck this.\n\n01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.360\nWait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.600\nWhat, what, Banthro?\n\n01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.920\nJust in here making omelets.\n\n01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.800\nI'm Chitara.\n\n01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.960\nChitara, I didn't recognize your voice.\n\n01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.080\nDo you recognize these?\n\n01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:16.960\nOh, sword of omens, lords of light.\n\n01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.040\nThose are incredible.\n\n01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.680\nExcuse me, there's a, the cat phone is ringing.\n\n01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.180\nHello.\n\n01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.440\nHave it, have not.\n\n01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.440\nOh, click.\n\n01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.360\nExcuse me.\n\n01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.800\nI belong to a trivia club.\n\n01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.400\nWho the fuck was that?\n\n01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.320\nWho's that?\n\n01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.240\nThat was the trivia club telling me what movie.\n\n01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.800\nWhy are you talking to her all the time?\n\n01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.160\nChitara, you can't be jealous and sleep with Banthro.\n\n01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:42.660\nZip.\n\n01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.440\nYou talked about this.\n\n01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.200\nI'm going to show you a couple more zips.\n\n01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.480\nMy god, Chitara.\n\n01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.240\nYour body is incredible.\n\n01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:57.240\nOh my god, you're not even a cat person.\n\n01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.240\nIt's mumra, it's mumra.\n\n01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.240\nMumra.\n\n01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:07.240\nWell, if it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get.\n\n01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:11.240\nThunder, thunder, thunder.\n\n01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.240\nOh shit, he stopped with the thunder process.\n\n01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.240\nNo one ever thought to do that.\n\n01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.240\nGod damn it.\n\n01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.240\nFuck, he stopped me before.\n\n01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.240\nBefore I could make my sword all the way.\n\n01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.240\nGod damn it, he put ice in my hands.\n\n01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.240\nMumra.\n\n01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.240\nDon't you like it?\n\n01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.240\nDon't you like it?\n\n01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.240\nDon't you like it?\n\n01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.240\nYou liked it that one time.\n\n01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.240\nMumra.\n\n01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.240\nGross.\n\n01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.240\nWhere are we on this planet?\n\n01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.240\nI don't know.\n\n01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:44.240\nI'm so, I'm so tired.\n\n01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.240\nYeah.\n\n01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.240\nAll the time.\n\n01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.240\nAll the time.\n\n01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:52.240\nMumra, how come you have to be two people?\n\n01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.240\nHow come you have to change from a mummy man into a...\n\n01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.240\nThat's a good question.\n\n01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.240\nThat's a good question.\n\n01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.240\nYou want to know?\n\n01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.240\nYeah.\n\n01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240\nYou want to know?\n\n01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.240\nHere.\n\n01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.240\nOkay, you want to know?\n\n01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.240\nYou want to know?\n\n01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:13.240\nOkay, so there's good energy and then there's bad energy.\n\n01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.240\nRight.\n\n01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.240\nAnd then there's in between.\n\n01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.240\nSo when you're a mummy, you're good?\n\n01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:24.240\nWell, good is defined by what we think is good and what is bad, correct?\n\n01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.240\nWell, I'm just a cat.\n\n01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.240\nWell, yes, but you have an opinion of what is good, right?\n\n01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:35.240\nI believe that the thunder energy is the only good energy in the world, reverse.\n\n01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.240\nAnd I, in 2018, do not.\n\n01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.240\nWhat?\n\n01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.240\nMumra.\n\n01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.240\nRight.\n\n01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:47.240\nSo I'm good when I'm old mummy guy, right?\n\n01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:55.240\nBut when I want to be bad and kick some ass, I turn into a super mumra.\n\n01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:01.240\nAnd that's when I take my sword of omens and pray to the Lord of light to give me sight\n\n01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:07.240\nbeyond sight and then say thunder several times and assemble the thunder cats.\n\n01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.240\nWhy, why don't you just have the sword always long?\n\n01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.240\nThat's the real question.\n\n01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:20.240\nSwords are for fighting and I believe in peace.\n\n01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:25.240\nThat's why my hope is that I'll never have to have sight beyond sight ever again.\n\n01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.240\nHow long does it take you to grow the sword long?\n\n01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.240\nWell, let me run through it in my head.\n\n01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:38.240\nThunder, thunder, thunder, thunder cats.\n\n01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.240\nAbout that long.\n\n01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.240\nAnd then there's the light that goes out into space.\n\n01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:42.240\nAnd then all of them come.\n\n01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.240\nTurns into the bat signal.\n\n01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.240\nThey come out.\n\n01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.240\nEverybody runs to there.\n\n01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.240\nOkay.\n\n01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.240\nAnd the animation is done on the ones as they come.\n\n01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.240\nRight.\n\n01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.240\nA minute long of animation.\n\n01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.240\nYes, it's a solid.\n\n01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:58.240\nAnd once a week, I turn into a strong mumra.\n\n01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.240\nAnother minute.\n\n01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.240\nRight.\n\n01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.240\nAnd then there's credits, which is two minutes.\n\n01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.240\nYes.\n\n01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.240\nAnd then there's end credits, which is another full minute.\n\n01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.240\nYes.\n\n01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:12.240\nSo that's like five minutes we don't have to deal with.\n\n01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.240\nThe rest is the shitty stuff.\n\n01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.240\nRight.\n\n01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.240\nWell, Snarf made some soup the other day.\n\n01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.240\nRight.\n\n01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.240\nAnd the panthro thought was too spicy.\n\n01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.240\nRight.\n\n01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.240\nRight.\n\n01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.240\nAnd that's all.\n\n01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.240\nWhat do you mean panthro?\n\n01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.240\nSnarf, let's be honest.\n\n01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.240\nYou're here for the three year olds.\n\n01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.240\nI think it's a reach.\n\n01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.240\nWe have to eat something.\n\n01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.240\nThe families have to eat their children by leaving them\n\n01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.240\nin front of the television.\n\n01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.240\nYou're getting pretty dark.\n\n01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:43.240\nSnarf makes me uncomfortable as mumra.\n\n01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.240\nWhy?\n\n01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.240\nAnd I'm a living dead.\n\n01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240\nWhy?\n\n01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.240\nYou're a nice guy.\n\n01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.240\nI'm just trying to make soup.\n\n01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.240\nBut you talk English.\n\n01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.240\nYes.\n\n01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.240\nBut you walk on all fours.\n\n01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.240\nWell, sometimes.\n\n01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.240\nYou have like a personal relationship with all these people.\n\n01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:03.240\nDo you ever try to protect me from this emotional abuse?\n\n01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.240\nSnarf, this is a bed you made a long time ago.\n\n01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.240\nYou don't wear pants.\n\n01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.240\nYou can't drive a car.\n\n01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.240\nWhat do you wear?\n\n01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.240\nMummy?\n\n01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.240\nBandages.\n\n01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.240\nRight.\n\n01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:18.240\nBecause I'm one person all the time.\n\n01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.240\nYou walk on all fours.\n\n01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.240\nYou have to go into a second identity to prove who you are.\n\n01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.240\nDoes he shit in the bathroom?\n\n01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.240\nOr does he just like shit in front of you?\n\n01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.240\nLike a dog.\n\n01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.240\nI'll take a shit right in front of you.\n\n01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.240\nSnarf, stop.\n\n01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.240\nWhat?\n\n01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.240\nLionel, should I not take a shit?\n\n01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.240\nDon't take a shit.\n\n01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.240\nPut some pants on.\n\n01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.240\nStand on your own two legs and learn how to drive.\n\n01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.240\nHe's basically cringer, but he never turns into battle cat.\n\n01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.240\nThat's what his thing is.\n\n01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.240\nWell, he says his name a lot too.\n\n01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.240\nSnarf.\n\n01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.240\nHe's derivative.\n\n01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.240\nHe should be called derivative.\n\n01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.240\nWhat?\n\n01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.240\nLionel?\n\n01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.240\nBut Snarf.\n\n01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.240\nMy friend?\n\n01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.240\nNo, I'm your host and you're a parasite.\n\n01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.240\nOh, fuck you.\n\n01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.240\nWell, you know what?\n\n01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240\nFuck me.\n\n01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.240\nFuck you.\n\n01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.240\nSnarf.\n\n01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.240\nSnarf.\n\n01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.240\nSnarf.\n\n01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.240\nSnarvy.\n\n01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.240\nOh, fuck.\n\n01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.240\nOh, shit.\n\n01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.240\nNow we can stand.\n\n01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240\nOh, God.\n\n01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240\nNow we can walk around.\n\n01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.240\nNow we can have a relationship.\n\n01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.240\nI'm normalized Snarf.\n\n01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.240\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.240\nWell.\n\n01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.240\nWe just saved ourselves six minutes of animation.\n\n01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.240\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.240\nYou seem like a normal guy.\n\n01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.240\nYeah, I was happy.\n\n01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.240\nWe're all normal.\n\n01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.240\nEverybody's fine.\n\n01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.240\nStopping bullies.\n\n01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:38.240\nI think if I taught anybody anything as Snarf, it's don't bully anybody.\n\n01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.240\nYou guys are, you live in a bully culture.\n\n01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:46.240\nBut if you have to teach us it by being high maintenance and taking up that much real estate,\n\n01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.240\nis the lesson even worth it?\n\n01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:51.240\nI mean, maybe it's a self-generated job guarding against bullying.\n\n01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:58.240\nBut to be honest, I spent 30 seconds being non-Snarf, like being a self-activated Snarf.\n\n01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.240\nI want to go back to being regular flawed Snarf.\n\n01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.240\nMore comfortable, is it, to complain about everyone bullying you?\n\n01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:05.240\nYeah.\n\n01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.240\nThat's not a bad idea.\n\n01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.240\nSnarf, like, having a transformation sequence where he's not like this quadruped walking\n\n01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.240\naround, probably humping shit.\n\n01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.240\nHe just turns into a guy.\n\n01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.240\nHe just stands around too late because you need me to pick up these dishes here.\n\n01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.240\nI can do it now.\n\n01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.240\nYeah, but I'm going to go back to being regular Snarf because I find it more comfortable.\n\n01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.240\nNobody in He-Man.\n\n01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.240\nI mean, forget about the fact that Prince Adam looked exactly like He-Man.\n\n01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.240\nI haven't.\n\n01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.240\nHe had a green cat that then, and then He-Man also had a green cat.\n\n01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.240\nIt was just rubbing people's faces.\n\n01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:38.240\nBut Battlecat didn't do shit, and Cringer had a personality.\n\n01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240\nBattlecat just had a helmet on.\n\n01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.240\nThat wasn't the, I don't, sure.\n\n01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.240\nRight?\n\n01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.240\nIt didn't make him less recognizable.\n\n01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.240\nAh, He-Man.\n\n01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.240\nI gotta assume there's a hardwick podcast that's covered all of this.\n\n01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.240\nHey, He-Man.\n\n01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.240\nPeter Laurie is back.\n\n01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.240\nHey, it's me, Rick.\n\n01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.240\nIt's me, Peter Laurie.\n\n01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.240\nHey, He-Man.\n\n01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.240\nHe-Man, huh?\n\n01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:05.240\nDid you watch that thing on Netflix, the toys that made us in the 80s?\n\n01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.240\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:13.240\nThey did this whole creation of He-Man and how the guy who created He-Man the toy was\n\n01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.240\njust talking shit about the cartoon.\n\n01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.240\nLike, he goes, he's all buff.\n\n01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.240\nPrince Adam's all buff.\n\n01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.240\nHe's, like, all ripped, but he's a wimp.\n\n01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:24.240\nThat doesn't make any goddamn sense.\n\n01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.240\nSo, what came first, the toy or the cartoon?\n\n01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.240\nThe toy.\n\n01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.240\nOh.\n\n01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.240\nLook, they, the people, I forgot who it was.\n\n01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.240\nIt was Mattel.\n\n01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.240\nI think.\n\n01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.240\nWhat?\n\n01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.240\nWas it?\n\n01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.240\nOh.\n\n01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:44.240\nWell, Hasbro has He-Man now, but I think Mattel had He-Man, but they had a chance to get\n\n01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.240\nStar Wars.\n\n01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.240\nThey went, nah, that movie's not going to go anywhere.\n\n01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.240\nAnd then, Kenner got it.\n\n01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.240\nAnd then, they went, shit.\n\n01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.240\nAnd then, G.I. Joe came around, and they went, fuck.\n\n01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:00.240\nAnd then, they said, well, why don't we create something, why don't we create a property\n\n01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.240\nbefore the movie?\n\n01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:08.240\nAnd they created He-Man, and, and He-Man is just like, they looked at G.I. Joe, and they\n\n01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:11.240\nlooked at, like, Luke Skywalker, and they go, look at these guys.\n\n01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.240\nThey're not posed.\n\n01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.240\nThey have blank expressions.\n\n01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.240\nThey're really small.\n\n01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.240\nLet's make them really buff and give them, like, expression, and, and, like, you know,\n\n01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.240\nlike, make them a bigger toy.\n\n01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.240\nAnd, and then, during, like, the pitch meeting, when they were going to, like, Toys R Us,\n\n01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:30.240\nthey, they said, yeah, well, is there, how are kids going to know about this?\n\n01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.240\nAnd they go, oh, well, they're going to watch the cartoon.\n\n01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:37.240\nAnd they went, oh, okay, well, then we'll, we'll, we'll buy a bunch of this stuff.\n\n01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.240\nThis sounds great.\n\n01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.240\nAnd then, they left the room and said, well, what do you mean cartoon?\n\n01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.240\nAnd they go, well, we'll have to make some phone calls.\n\n01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.240\nAll right, Rob, if you could make a movie or a TV show, and there was an action figure\n\n01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.240\nthat kids played with, what would the action figure be?\n\n01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.240\nWhat?\n\n01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.240\nLike, make up a new one?\n\n01:15:54.240 --> 01:16:01.240\nIf you created a show that is something, like, an idea that you've already had, because\n\n01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.240\nyou got lots of great ideas, or a new one.\n\n01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:09.240\nBut if you found out when you were an old man on your death bed and kids all loved,\n\n01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.240\nthere was one action figure, what would the action figure be?\n\n01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.240\nSomething that's already present?\n\n01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.240\nLike, something that you created.\n\n01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.240\nWell, probably Skud.\n\n01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.240\nI mean, like Skud.\n\n01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.240\nOh, Skud.\n\n01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.240\nYeah.\n\n01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.240\nThat would be cool.\n\n01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.240\nYeah.\n\n01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.240\nWell, Skud, Skud had an action figure, but that was a disaster.\n\n01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.240\nWe hit, we hit peak toy with micronauts.\n\n01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:32.240\nMy brother had micronauts, and like, they were, they were the best toy ever.\n\n01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.240\nThey were really fun.\n\n01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.240\nThey were all swallowable pieces.\n\n01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.240\nEverything, that was the gimmick.\n\n01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.240\nEverything was swallowable.\n\n01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.240\nLike.\n\n01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.240\nThey had little fists that could come off that were like pill size.\n\n01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.240\nEverything was pill size.\n\n01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.240\nEverything was removable.\n\n01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.240\nThey're heads.\n\n01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.240\nYeah, everything good.\n\n01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.240\nYou could just, it was just the size of a baby's epiglottis.\n\n01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.240\nNo bigger, no smaller.\n\n01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.240\nYeah.\n\n01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.240\nWhat was the guy that talked fast?\n\n01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.240\nMicromachines.\n\n01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.240\nThat was micromachines.\n\n01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.240\nMicromachines.\n\n01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.240\nWe got, did you have this micronauts toy?\n\n01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240\nThis is a deep cut.\n\n01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.240\nThis is deeper than, this is like.\n\n01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.240\nMy brother might have had it.\n\n01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:09.240\nIt was a giant hornet with like purple transparent wings.\n\n01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.240\nIt was a spaceship.\n\n01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:13.240\nI think, and then you could hold all your micronauts in it.\n\n01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.240\nI don't know.\n\n01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.240\nI don't know.\n\n01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.240\nIt was like wasptron or something like that or whatever.\n\n01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.240\nBut it had like this.\n\n01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.240\nIt was all black.\n\n01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.240\nHad like a pointed face with like red windows.\n\n01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.240\nYou could open it up.\n\n01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.240\nThat was the cockpit.\n\n01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:32.240\nYou put your micronaut in it and then had like these laser purple wings that you could\n\n01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.240\nmake flap or whatever.\n\n01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.240\nAnd it was like the coolest thing ever.\n\n01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:41.240\nAnd Jeff Schrab got that for Christmas because he always got the cool shit.\n\n01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:47.240\nAnd I got clothes, the vegetable soup of gifts.\n\n01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.240\nYeah.\n\n01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.240\nYeah.\n\n01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.240\nBut those clothes today.\n\n01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.240\nLook at me.\n\n01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.240\nYeah.\n\n01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.240\nYeah.\n\n01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:58.240\nMicronauts were cooked because they were just so, they were tiny.\n\n01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.240\nAnd but the every fucking joint was articulated.\n\n01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.240\nThey were metal too.\n\n01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.240\nThey had like their heads were like metal.\n\n01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.240\nYeah.\n\n01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.240\nWhat was your favorite toy growing up?\n\n01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.240\nLike the one toy that you could rely on?\n\n01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.240\nWhen you're talking about micronauts, they remind me of Z-bots, which seem kind of similar.\n\n01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:19.240\nThey're like a collectible figure that's pretty small.\n\n01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.240\nBut yeah, I don't know.\n\n01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.240\nI like connects.\n\n01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.240\nFor me, it was Legos and Star Wars action figures.\n\n01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.240\nYeah.\n\n01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.240\nLike Legos is the best.\n\n01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.240\nAnd then you get, you have to go pee in the middle of the night and you step in a Lego\n\n01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.240\nand you just die because it hurts.\n\n01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.240\nStephen got a fucking At-At Walker.\n\n01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:38.240\nWhat?\n\n01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.240\nAnd I got a fucking sweater.\n\n01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.240\nI feel like that's because probably.\n\n01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.240\nWhat the fuck is this?\n\n01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.240\nI told you the Kendall story, right?\n\n01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.240\nI told you that.\n\n01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.240\nNo, tell us again.\n\n01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:59.240\nI would play Barbies with the girls next door a lot.\n\n01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.240\nAnd you would win.\n\n01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:06.240\nI would win when they would leave the room and I would pull my dick out and rub them\n\n01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.240\nall over the Barbies.\n\n01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.240\nWait, how jokie is that joke?\n\n01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.240\nHow jokie?\n\n01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.240\nIt's not a joke.\n\n01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.240\nYou would rub your dick on the Barbies?\n\n01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.240\nAnd I would kiss them.\n\n01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.240\nAnd you rub your dick on them?\n\n01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.240\nYeah.\n\n01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.240\nOn the Barbies?\n\n01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.240\nYeah.\n\n01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:23.240\nOkay.\n\n01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.240\nI was 21.\n\n01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.240\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:31.240\nNow, I was so in love with Barbies.\n\n01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:37.240\nI would just kiss them and rub them on my face and everywhere and take off their clothes.\n\n01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.240\nAnd it was just so fascinating.\n\n01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.240\nWell, you didn't have sisters.\n\n01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.240\nI had a sister, but she was institutionalized.\n\n01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.240\nShe didn't have Barbies.\n\n01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.240\nAnd so there's deprivation.\n\n01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:53.240\nIf you're not raised around a sister, you're encountering femininity for the first time\n\n01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.240\nthrough girls' toys.\n\n01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.240\nRight.\n\n01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:04.240\nYou go to the girl across the street or you're getting play dates or whatever.\n\n01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:11.240\nThis girl's got these girl toys and the girl toys are girls with hair and skirts.\n\n01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:18.240\nYou're maybe seven years old, but you're still a little barbarian.\n\n01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.240\nYeah, I was snarf-humping on these toys.\n\n01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:31.240\nAnd I guess I played with Barbies enough that my parents told my grandma,\n\n01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:36.240\nwell, what does Stephen...\n\n01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.240\nRobby.\n\n01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.240\nWhat does Jeff...\n\n01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.240\nRobby.\n\n01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.240\nRobby.\n\n01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.240\nWhat does Robby want for Christmas?\n\n01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:47.240\nAnd they told him the Barbie story and so they don't give him a Barbie.\n\n01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.240\nAnd they gave me a...\n\n01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.240\nBecause then they don't want a gay son.\n\n01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.240\nRight.\n\n01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.240\nSo they gave me a Kindle.\n\n01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.240\nSo I opened it up.\n\n01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:58.240\nStephen gets like fucking Ewoks and Mumras and shit.\n\n01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:02.240\nAnd I'm like sitting there and I open it up and I get a Kindle.\n\n01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:07.240\nAnd I looked at it and all this went like flash through my head.\n\n01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:10.240\nAnd I was like, oh my God, they think I'm gay.\n\n01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.240\nAnd this is a way to stop it.\n\n01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.240\nAnd it's totally ineffective.\n\n01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.240\nThis is making me way gayer.\n\n01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.240\nYeah.\n\n01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.240\nAnd then I start full on...\n\n01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.240\nThey put the pedal to the metal.\n\n01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.240\nThis guy is a beefcake.\n\n01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.240\nYes.\n\n01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.240\nAnd then I pull on, not cry, cry.\n\n01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.240\nAnd I'm going, grandma, I didn't want this.\n\n01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:37.240\nI want this stomping my foot way too old to be that like fucking...\n\n01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.240\nPart of it is...\n\n01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.240\nCartman level crying.\n\n01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:44.240\nPart of it is it's a disappointing gift, but most of it is the humiliation.\n\n01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.240\nIt was me screaming to the world, no, you don't understand.\n\n01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.240\nI wanted to tell him, no.\n\n01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.240\nI'm straight as an arrow.\n\n01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.240\nThat's why I love those Barbie dolls.\n\n01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.240\nI'm too straight.\n\n01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:58.240\nI'm dangerously straight.\n\n01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.240\nYes.\n\n01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.240\nI put my dick on a Barbie.\n\n01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.240\nI like the idea that your parents thought...\n\n01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:06.240\nAnd my dad beat the shit out of me.\n\n01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.240\nThat was the worst thing.\n\n01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:16.240\nLike he beat me to death and then stuck my face in the corner and made me stay there forever\n\n01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:21.240\nbecause I was like, no, I don't want this.\n\n01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.240\nI don't want it.\n\n01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.240\nYou got the wrong idea.\n\n01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.240\nI was molesting those dolls.\n\n01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.240\nBut if he had opened up the Kendo and go, oh, hooray.\n\n01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.240\nBut he would like that too.\n\n01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.240\nThat's the part that I'm fascinated by.\n\n01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:39.240\nIs that they were sort of like, I like the nuance with which this Midwestern family is\n\n01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:43.240\nkind of like, he spends an awful lot of time with those girl toys.\n\n01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:50.240\nIsn't there a masculine aspect to them that we could use to bring them back into the roller derby?\n\n01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.240\nOh my God, I was like so upset.\n\n01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.240\nI walked into my son rubbing his dick on a female doll.\n\n01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:59.240\nLet's give him a male doll to rub his dick on.\n\n01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.240\nThey didn't know he was rubbing his dick on.\n\n01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:07.240\nThey thought he was interested in playing with the female dolls.\n\n01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:12.240\nThey didn't know he was properly objectifying women at an early age.\n\n01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.240\nAnd that there was nothing to worry about.\n\n01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.240\nMeanwhile, Steve is getting the Death Star.\n\n01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.240\nYou have to fucking add that with the fucking everything.\n\n01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.240\nYou can fly out the bottom of the add-at.\n\n01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:26.240\nBut isn't part of this, Rob, because I grew up, I've died an older brother,\n\n01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:33.240\nand a big tradition in the Midwest in our generation was that Christmas would come,\n\n01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:37.240\nand they'd just take the Sears catalog and plop it in front of you.\n\n01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:41.240\nOh, they stopped doing that after you discovered the bra section.\n\n01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.240\nRight.\n\n01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:49.240\nI mean, or the Toys R Us catalog, it would be like, oh, Santa wants to know what you want.\n\n01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:53.240\nAnd then you'd have to go through the book.\n\n01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:59.240\nAnd there's all these kick-ass toys, but you'd point at them and go, I want that.\n\n01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.240\nAnd their parents would go, well, no, Santa can't afford that.\n\n01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.240\nYou fucking idiot.\n\n01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:10.240\nAnd then you'd settle on a thing that was, I assume, around $30 in Carter era.\n\n01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:15.240\nLike, whatever Optimus Prime was worth in 1988.\n\n01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.240\nI didn't get that.\n\n01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.240\nI didn't get Optimus Prime.\n\n01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.240\nBut I'm just saying, like, that process, though, I'm saying I would end up.\n\n01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.240\nGot a fucking Kindle.\n\n01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:28.240\nAnd it was one where you could put, like, you could give him a sideburn.\n\n01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.240\nOr a beard, or whatever.\n\n01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:31.240\nAnd he's got a suit and tie.\n\n01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.240\nAnd maybe you could dress up and comb your hair every once in a while, Robbie.\n\n01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:42.240\nAnd it's like, Steven's, like, in the 25th century, Jeff is building stuff out of Apollo Lego.\n\n01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.240\nAnd I just get the clothes and the fucking shit.\n\n01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.240\nThere's, yeah.\n\n01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.240\nWell, it's good.\n\n01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.240\nThis is good.\n\n01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.240\nI like this.\n\n01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.240\nYeah, everything bad happening to you is actually good.\n\n01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.240\nWhy?\n\n01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.240\nBecause Dan says so.\n\n01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.240\nNo, I'm saying it's good to see he's alive.\n\n01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:05.240\nAnd so he's got to, he's, you know, you're a fear of being angry.\n\n01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:09.240\nYou're a fear of being just a barbaric.\n\n01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:11.240\nYeah, they might be part of it.\n\n01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240\nLike, we want to be good guys.\n\n01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.240\nWe want to be gentle and evolved and...\n\n01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.240\nSmurf is a hard game.\n\n01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.240\nI just was watching a YouTube video of it.\n\n01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.240\nAnd man, you know what's after that first screen?\n\n01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.240\nA second screen with the second fence.\n\n01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.240\nIt's like the same exact place.\n\n01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:27.240\nFence is a little higher.\n\n01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.240\nNo, it's not even.\n\n01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.240\nAnd then, and then it's a two screens of nothing.\n\n01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.240\nAnd then a screen where you have to jump over a little crab grass in the exact same spot as those fences.\n\n01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.240\nDo you have the video?\n\n01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:44.240\nDo you have the videos that play the song that you would hear over and over and over again until you went crazy?\n\n01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.240\nScream crying.\n\n01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.240\nScream.\n\n01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.240\nI did a lot of scream crying when I was a kid.\n\n01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.240\nNo wonder.\n\n01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.240\nAt least you had a calico, you know?\n\n01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.240\nWell, we had a calico Adam.\n\n01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.240\nMy family had an odyssey.\n\n01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:03.240\nBecause that's how you roll when your dad's a baker.\n\n01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.240\nFucking bakers.\n\n01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.240\nI thought someone was beatboxing.\n\n01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.240\nSee, hear that?\n\n01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.240\nThat's hitting the fence.\n\n01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.240\nYeah, you hit the fence and then it just all stops.\n\n01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:27.240\nAnd then all happiness stops.\n\n01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.240\nAnd then you do that three times.\n\n01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:29.240\nWhat was the Smurfs?\n\n01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.240\nWhat was the Smurfs?\n\n01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:33.240\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.240\nThat was the theme.\n\n01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:40.240\nWe are the Smurfs and we were made with no joy.\n\n01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.240\nThe only Smurf for you is one who is true blue.\n\n01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.240\nThat Smurf is me.\n\n01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.240\nMy name is hefty.\n\n01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.240\nGargamel wanted to eat the Smurfs.\n\n01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.240\nNo, he wanted to turn them into gold.\n\n01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.240\nOh, Smurfs.\n\n01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.240\nHow is he going to do that?\n\n01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:59.240\nHow many apples high was a Smurf?\n\n01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.240\nThree.\n\n01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.240\nOkay.\n\n01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:05.240\nAll right, let's play some fucking D and motherfucking D.\n\n01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.240\nWhich is actually terrifying.\n\n01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.240\nSomething three apples high is terrifying to me.\n\n01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.240\nThat's too high.\n\n01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.240\nThey don't look that big.\n\n01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:14.240\nYeah, how big are the motherfucking mushrooms?\n\n01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:17.240\nThey got windows and shit in there and a chimney, motherfucker.\n\n01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.240\nMotherfucker, three apples high and they go through that door.\n\n01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.240\nThat means the mushrooms up to my hip.\n\n01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.240\nAll right, at least.\n\n01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.240\nLet's let's say playing with y'all.\n\n01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:30.240\nLet's save that for our other podcast called Smurf grief.\n\n01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:33.240\nUrban cartoon architect.\n\n01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.240\nI love you.\n\n01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.240\nThree apples.\n\n01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.240\nHow big are your apples?\n\n01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.240\nRob, were you here last week?\n\n01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.240\nNo.\n\n01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.240\nHip to the jive?\n\n01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.240\nNo.\n\n01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.240\nDo you want to play Rob?\n\n01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.240\nI know you hate games.\n\n01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.240\nWe're pretty sure he's excited.\n\n01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:48.240\nNo, I don't.\n\n01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.240\nYou're about to waylay a guy that's currently pooping, right?\n\n01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:53.240\nRight.\n\n01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.240\nI feel like every time I play, I do it wrong.\n\n01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.240\nIt's fine.\n\n01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.240\nYou'll probably be OK.\n\n01:27:58.240 --> 01:27:59.240\nThat's it.\n\n01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.240\nBreak it down.\n\n01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.240\nLast time on Harmon Time.\n\n01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:11.240\nOur heroes were in Dornester on the quest for Patchen's gem.\n\n01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.240\nAfter some initial fact finding,\n\n01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:17.240\nthey discovered enough to realize that they should head to the theater\n\n01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.240\nand find some clues.\n\n01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.240\nThere, they met a guy named Gretel, who was fat\n\n01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.240\nand asked him some questions.\n\n01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.240\nAnd he pointed them all into the direction of Shrove,\n\n01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.240\na figure about town.\n\n01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.240\nAnd so, on the pursuit for Shrove, our heroes left\n\n01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:38.240\nand went to the tavern, but not before discussing\n\n01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.240\nwhat they thought was the situation at hand,\n\n01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:45.240\nwhich I wish I could quote directly, but I cannot.\n\n01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.240\nThen they went to the tavern where they met Cool Dennis\n\n01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:53.240\nand learned some information where they met this dude\n\n01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.240\nand he had a cloak and it turned out it was Patchen's cloak\n\n01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.240\nfrom when he got robbed that first time\n\n01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:02.240\nwhen it set off the quest of Patchen's gem in the first place.\n\n01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.240\nAnd the guy who was wearing that cloak,\n\n01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.240\nhe said the guy who gave him the cloak was Shrove\n\n01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:09.240\nand he was in the bathroom or something like that.\n\n01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.240\nAnd then the gang set up in the bathroom,\n\n01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:16.240\nmaking sure to send diarrhea to the window to guard for an escape.\n\n01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.240\nSurrounding Shrove in the bathroom,\n\n01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.240\nour heroes were about to leap into action\n\n01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.240\nto hopefully get to the bottom of the quest for Patchen's gem.\n\n01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.240\nBut will they?\n\n01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.240\nSo I'm standing by the window.\n\n01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.240\nYou're outside this tavern.\n\n01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:37.240\nRight.\n\n01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.240\nBecause there's a guy in the bathroom of the tavern\n\n01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:42.240\nthat's like our perp.\n\n01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:43.240\nHe's a guy we want.\n\n01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.240\nI'm playing it cool.\n\n01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.240\nI sent you out in case there's a window to the bathroom\n\n01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.240\nbecause I don't want this guy leaving.\n\n01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.240\nI'm playing it cool.\n\n01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.240\nYou're playing it cool.\n\n01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.240\nI'm playing it cool.\n\n01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.240\nYou're outside the window.\n\n01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:55.240\nI'm ready to cast flair to dazzle him when he comes out\n\n01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.240\nso that you can waylay him, Carlos.\n\n01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.240\nDo I see Jeff?\n\n01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.240\nNo, you're outside.\n\n01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.240\nNo, because you're outside.\n\n01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:05.240\nCarlos and I are around the bathroom door.\n\n01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:07.240\nYou're outside around the window, right?\n\n01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:09.240\nIt's kind of like the drawing room or wherever.\n\n01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.240\nSo like the back of the bathroom is like way far away.\n\n01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.240\nSo I'm just hanging out.\n\n01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.240\nI'm just playing it cool.\n\n01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:17.240\nYeah, you're just trying to see if anyone climbs out.\n\n01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.240\nYeah, you're playing it cool.\n\n01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:20.240\nI'm playing it cool.\n\n01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.240\nI'd say you're playing it cool.\n\n01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.240\nOutside the window of the bathroom.\n\n01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:25.240\nSo Carlos, let's make sure we got our shit together.\n\n01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.240\nWhen Shrove comes out of here from poop\n\n01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:30.240\nand we know that this guy is involved\n\n01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.240\nwith the waylaying of Patchen's,\n\n01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:37.240\nhe probably has the gem.\n\n01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:40.240\nI'm ready to cast flair to dazzle him.\n\n01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:43.240\nOr should we figure this out?\n\n01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:44.240\nWhat's the best way to know about this?\n\n01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:47.240\nWell, yeah, we need to plan post-apprehension\n\n01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.240\nbecause we're not taking him to the Church of Silver Flame.\n\n01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.240\nNo, we're taking him down.\n\n01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:53.240\nWe're taking him to 21 Fuck You Street.\n\n01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.240\nWell, we're taking him God knows where.\n\n01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:00.240\nBut yeah, we gotta not cause a civic incident.\n\n01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:03.240\nPeople see us mugging this guy.\n\n01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:06.240\nAll right, so maybe we just knock him unconscious.\n\n01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:11.240\nI can do shaleily and cudgel this guy and knock him out.\n\n01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:14.240\nAnd then you're stronger than me.\n\n01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:15.240\nYou're bigger than me.\n\n01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:17.240\nWe can just take him.\n\n01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.240\nYeah, I just don't know where to take him.\n\n01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:26.240\nBut we just get him outside.\n\n01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.240\nIs it nighttime?\n\n01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.240\nHey, cool, Dennis.\n\n01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.240\nIt's getting towards evening.\n\n01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:30.240\nYeah.\n\n01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.240\nDo you have rooms to rent here?\n\n01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:34.240\nNo, this is just kind of like a tavern.\n\n01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:37.240\nIt's not a tavern slash inn or whatever.\n\n01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:39.240\nWe don't get too many visitors.\n\n01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:41.240\nWhat's your policy on people knocking out people\n\n01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:44.240\nas they come out of a bathroom and dragging them out of the tavern?\n\n01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.240\nI'd say it's directly against both the rules of this tavern\n\n01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:50.240\nand the rules of House Galando,\n\n01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.240\nwhich governs all sorts of places of hospitality in the nation.\n\n01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.240\nOh, shit, that's bad for us.\n\n01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.240\nIs there any way to get a temporary permit\n\n01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:01.240\nif our interest is in not disrupting your house of hospitality\n\n01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.240\nif I could give you some gold pieces just as a reprieve\n\n01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:08.240\nbecause our goal is to just make this as painless as possible,\n\n01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.240\njust want to get him out of here and take him somewhere else.\n\n01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.240\nHe looks at you with a look and he says,\n\n01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:16.240\nSonny, I don't think you know the situation you are in.\n\n01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.240\nDo you know who Shrove is, what he is to this town?\n\n01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.240\nDo you know who you are to this town?\n\n01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.240\nWell, I'm a stranger.\n\n01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.240\nRight.\n\n01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.240\nIsn't Shrove's a master?\n\n01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.240\nShrove's a good friend.\n\n01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.240\nHe's the master of the theater guild, right?\n\n01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:32.240\nYeah, the Gretel told you he was the theater master, I think.\n\n01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.240\nWell, do you know what the church is to this town?\n\n01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.240\nA pain in my rump.\n\n01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.240\nYeah, well, it can only get bigger.\n\n01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:42.240\nI mean, Shrove's got himself into a real hot mess.\n\n01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.240\nI don't want any trouble.\n\n01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.240\nI don't want to win a popularity contest either.\n\n01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.240\nI walk up to Carlos and go, Carlos with a wink,\n\n01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.240\nlike, hey, you know

01:35:12.240\nIt's a standard poop.\n\n01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:13.240\nI'm gonna wait this motherfucker out.\n\n01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.240\nIt's...\n\n01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.240\nWell, at least it's fucking...\n\n01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.240\nIt's ready to go.\n\n01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:19.240\nAll right.\n\n01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:20.240\nSo I was knocking pretty hard.\n\n01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.240\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:22.240\nDid you...\n\n01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:25.240\nDid you add that into the role?\n\n01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.240\nYeah.\n\n01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.240\nAnd you're one of the strongest people here, I think.\n\n01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.240\nYeah.\n\n01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:32.240\nAnd the wind...\n\n01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.240\nAnd that didn't do anything.\n\n01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.240\nWell, it made noise, but he didn't respond.\n\n01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.240\nI think he's dead.\n\n01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.240\nMaybe he was scared.\n\n01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.240\nI'm gonna open the window.\n\n01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.240\nOkay.\n\n01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:42.240\nOkay.\n\n01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:45.240\nAnd then I stick like my elvish blade.\n\n01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:51.240\nAnd then I stick like just the tip underneath the crack of the window.\n\n01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:55.240\nAnd I use it as like a lever.\n\n01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:56.240\nYeah.\n\n01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.240\nTo...\n\n01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.240\nWell, how would you do it?\n\n01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.240\nNo, this is right.\n\n01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:01.240\nI'm not laughing at your methodology.\n\n01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:02.240\nOkay.\n\n01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:03.240\nOkay.\n\n01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.240\nAnd then I start prying it.\n\n01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.240\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.240\nYou know, and it probably...\n\n01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.240\nIt'll probably take a couple...\n\n01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.240\nBecause you know, when you do like the butter knife thing, it kind of...\n\n01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.240\nIt doesn't get under there right away.\n\n01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.240\nRight.\n\n01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:13.240\nBut I get, you know...\n\n01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.240\nYou get there.\n\n01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:15.240\nYeah.\n\n01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:16.240\nI kind of...\n\n01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.240\nI go back and forth a little bit.\n\n01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.240\nYeah.\n\n01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.240\nTo get it underneath.\n\n01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.240\nOkay.\n\n01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.240\nAnd then I...\n\n01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.240\nAnd then I...\n\n01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.240\nAre you rolling the dice?\n\n01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.240\nWell, you're not done yet.\n\n01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:26.240\nOn the table.\n\n01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:27.240\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.240\nI don't need to see what you are gonna do.\n\n01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:29.240\nWhat am I doing?\n\n01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.240\nYou open the window.\n\n01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:31.240\nYeah, it opens.\n\n01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.240\nI open the window.\n\n01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.240\nRight.\n\n01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:34.240\nI open the window.\n\n01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.240\nYeah.\n\n01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.240\nIs there no dice?\n\n01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.240\nNo.\n\n01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:38.240\nOkay.\n\n01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.240\nOpen the window.\n\n01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.240\nI go, hey, hey!\n\n01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.240\nOpen the corner, not near the toilet or anything.\n\n01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.240\nHe's just staring at you.\n\n01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.240\nBlair Witch.\n\n01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:49.240\nLike he's been seeing you knocking on the window and then slowly working it open.\n\n01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:50.240\nRight.\n\n01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.240\nSo he's just staring at you.\n\n01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:53.240\nHe's like an older...\n\n01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:57.240\nHe's an older black guy wearing like kind of glasses.\n\n01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.240\nAnd he's got these big thick long dreads.\n\n01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:03.240\nAnd he wears like the clothes of a scholar.\n\n01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.240\nAnd yeah, he looks...\n\n01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:09.240\nHe looks like he's seen crazier shit than this.\n\n01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:12.240\nAnd at the same time, he's like, what?\n\n01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:15.240\nWhy would anyone want to see what's in a bathroom?\n\n01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:17.240\nThat's kind of the look he's got.\n\n01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.240\nOkay.\n\n01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.240\nAll right.\n\n01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.240\nSo, you know...\n\n01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.240\nSo you're looking at him.\n\n01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.240\nHe's looking at you.\n\n01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.240\nOkay, I'm gonna just...\n\n01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.240\nI stare back at him.\n\n01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.240\nUh-huh.\n\n01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:31.240\nFor how long?\n\n01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.240\nUntil he does something?\n\n01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.240\nUntil he does something.\n\n01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.240\nAll right.\n\n01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:38.240\nWell, then after about 20 seconds of this, he starts slowly inching to the door.\n\n01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.240\nOkay.\n\n01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.240\nYeah.\n\n01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.240\nAnd I'm gonna keep...\n\n01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:46.240\nAnd I'm gonna lock eyes with him and follow him like my sight.\n\n01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.240\nWith your eyes.\n\n01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:48.240\nWith my eyes.\n\n01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:49.240\nOkay.\n\n01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:50.240\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.240\nHe slowly makes his way towards the door.\n\n01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.240\nAnd I'm not making him do this with my mind, right?\n\n01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:57.240\nNo, you're definitely not making him do this with your mind.\n\n01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:58.240\nOkay, good.\n\n01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.240\nYeah.\n\n01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.240\nOkay.\n\n01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.240\nI mean, yeah.\n\n01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:02.240\nIt's intimidating.\n\n01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:04.240\nIt's intimidating, yeah.\n\n01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:09.240\nHe, he, he, he gropes through the door knob and he opens it and, um...\n\n01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.240\nI cast Flare to dazzle him.\n\n01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:13.240\nAll right.\n\n01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:16.240\nI'm gonna dazzle the fuck out of this guy.\n\n01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:17.240\nLevel zero spell.\n\n01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:19.240\nWhat's, what's your wisdom score?\n\n01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:22.240\nWhat's your wisdom score?\n\n01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:24.240\nMy wisdom is...\n\n01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.240\nSorry.\n\n01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.240\nWisdom.\n\n01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.240\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:31.240\nHe didn't roll high enough.\n\n01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:32.240\nSorry.\n\n01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:33.240\nHe gets dazzled?\n\n01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.240\nWell, you said Flare, right?\n\n01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:37.240\nI'm 19 wisdom.\n\n01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.240\nGreat.\n\n01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.240\nThat's really good.\n\n01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.240\nDoes that affect just him?\n\n01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.240\nUm...\n\n01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:43.240\nThe dazzle?\n\n01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.240\nYeah.\n\n01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.240\nYeah.\n\n01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.240\nWould I get dazzled too?\n\n01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.240\nI mean, I'm looking inside the bathroom.\n\n01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:50.240\nUh, well then, uh, yeah.\n\n01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:52.240\nSo, so I didn't dazzle him.\n\n01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.240\nNo, you dazzled him.\n\n01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.240\nUm, how dazzled is he?\n\n01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.240\nCompletely.\n\n01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:04.240\nI, I, I want to, I want to push then into the bathroom with the dazzled show.\n\n01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.240\nOkay.\n\n01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:06.240\nTrying to do it.\n\n01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.240\nI'm trying not to rate, you know, make it a big deal.\n\n01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.240\nIt is.\n\n01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.240\nCasting magic's a big deal.\n\n01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.240\nLike it's obvious, you know?\n\n01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:13.240\nOkay, well...\n\n01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.240\nIt's like a big magical display.\n\n01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:18.240\nWell, I still, I'm gonna push my way into the, into the bathroom of show.\n\n01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.240\nAll right.\n\n01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.240\nYou do that.\n\n01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:24.240\nUm, you notice, I mean, everything happens so fast, you know, so to speak or whatever.\n\n01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.240\nBut you, you do notice that when this, when these events start unfolding, literally everyone\n\n01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.240\nin the tatter and like leaps to their feet and starts moving towards you.\n\n01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.240\nBut you're in the bathroom now.\n\n01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:33.240\nRight.\n\n01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:35.240\nWell, uh, Jeff, are you going to the bathroom too?\n\n01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:38.240\nUm, I'm standing in the bathroom doorway dazzling.\n\n01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.240\nRight.\n\n01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.240\nBut then Dan shoved everyone into the bathroom.\n\n01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.240\nSo...\n\n01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.240\nOkay.\n\n01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:49.240\nUm, I stay in like the corridor leading in there and I pull out my chileli ready for\n\n01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:50.240\naction.\n\n01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:51.240\nAll right.\n\n01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.240\nYou can't do that because you've got to cast it as a spell first.\n\n01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:55.240\nWell, should I just go in the bathroom?\n\n01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:58.240\nYou could do, you could do so many things, man.\n\n01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:02.240\nWait, so, but I can't do chileli because I'm already got a spell going.\n\n01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.240\nWell, chileli is a spell.\n\n01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:08.240\nSo you have to cast that before and you don't have enough actions currently to cast two spells\n\n01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:09.240\nin a turn.\n\n01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:10.240\nUm, I...\n\n01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:11.240\nBut he could get into the bathroom with us.\n\n01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:12.240\nYeah.\n\n01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.240\nYeah.\n\n01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.240\nMove action.\n\n01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:17.240\nIf it's possible to do that, let's do it.\n\n01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:20.240\nIs the window big enough for me to crawl inside?\n\n01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:21.240\nYeah.\n\n01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.240\nThat's an alternative pitch to that.\n\n01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:24.240\nSo I'm halfway.\n\n01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:25.240\nOkay.\n\n01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.240\nWell, that, I think maybe this shouldn't be our destination.\n\n01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:30.240\nI was thinking maybe we go out.\n\n01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:31.240\nThe window.\n\n01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.240\nOkay.\n\n01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:33.240\nThe window.\n\n01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.240\nSo, okay.\n\n01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:38.240\nSo I, so I go, I, so Spencer, look at me because this is a visual thing.\n\n01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:39.240\nOkay.\n\n01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:42.240\nSo I'm going to do the...\n\n01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.240\nHe's, he's, he's given a boost.\n\n01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:45.240\nYeah.\n\n01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:46.240\nJust for them to come down.\n\n01:40:46.240 -->

--> 01:40:52.240\nWe've got this guy right now.\n\n01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:53.240\nYeah.\n\n01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:54.240\nMore than we're ever going to have him.\n\n01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.240\nI want the fucking gem.\n\n01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:56.240\nHe's dazzled.\n\n01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:57.240\nYeah.\n\n01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.240\nExactly.\n\n01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:59.240\nDazzled.\n\n01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:00.240\nSo I'm...\n\n01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:01.240\nHand him towards me.\n\n01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:02.240\nI say Shrove.\n\n01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:04.240\nCan you hear me?\n\n01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.240\nYeah, for sure.\n\n01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:12.240\nWe want Patchen's gem, which you may know as just the gem.\n\n01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.240\nIt's not yours.\n\n01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:17.240\nWhere is it?\n\n01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:19.240\nUm, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:21.240\nHere come the pain.\n\n01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.240\nShrove.\n\n01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:24.240\nI'm still doing this.\n\n01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.240\nYou're still boosting your...\n\n01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:31.240\nShrove, if I take you out of this bathroom without knowing anything about the gem, um,\n\n01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:32.240\nyou're...\n\n01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:35.240\nYou're as good as dead.\n\n01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:37.240\nIt's not going to go well for you.\n\n01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.240\nYou're as good as dead.\n\n01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.240\nThis is your last chance.\n\n01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:40.240\nWho are you people?\n\n01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.240\nWe're from the church.\n\n01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.240\nOkay.\n\n01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.240\nYou don't need to know who we are.\n\n01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:46.240\nNice.\n\n01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:53.240\nWe're from people that are better than you at taking gems and getting away with it.\n\n01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.240\nI want to...can I search him?\n\n01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.240\nIs there like a Frisk move?\n\n01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:01.240\nThat's just like...he doesn't have the fucking...he's not going to have it.\n\n01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:04.240\nBut I just want to see what's like in his pockets.\n\n01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:06.240\nEasy.\n\n01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:11.240\nYou moved to Frisk him, but his hand is like lightning and he shoots out and you didn't\n\n01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:14.240\neven see he was holding a dagger, but he slices you.\n\n01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:16.240\nDamn it.\n\n01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:17.240\nFuck.\n\n01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.240\nNow we're going to die.\n\n01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.240\nHe slices you for five damage.\n\n01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.240\nGod!\n\n01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.240\nFuck you.\n\n01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.240\nCan I cast a spell?\n\n01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:25.240\nCan I just do a regular action?\n\n01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.240\nIs there soap in the bathroom?\n\n01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.240\nYou should wash that.\n\n01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:28.240\nYeah, there is.\n\n01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:30.240\nYou should wash that out.\n\n01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.240\nYeah, you could cast something.\n\n01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:33.240\nI think it's Dan's turn first.\n\n01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.240\nNo, yeah, it is Dan's turn.\n\n01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:39.240\nWell, you've been stabbed now in mid Frisk.\n\n01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:44.240\nI'm going to reflexively, if someone's stabbing me, inflict moderate wounds.\n\n01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:47.240\nAll right, so do you see your touch attack?\n\n01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:49.240\nIt's on the other side.\n\n01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.240\nIt'll be kind of towards your attacks to the left, left.\n\n01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.240\nYeah, around there.\n\n01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:55.240\nTouch attack.\n\n01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.240\nTouch 11.\n\n01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:58.240\nNo, it's not that.\n\n01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:59.240\nOkay.\n\n01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.240\nUnless he's flat-footed.\n\n01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.240\nHe's not.\n\n01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.240\nBut you grab him.\n\n01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.240\nWait, moderate wounds?\n\n01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.240\nHow much damage is that?\n\n01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.240\nIt's inflict moderate wounds.\n\n01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.240\nIt's like three, right?\n\n01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.240\nTwo or three?\n\n01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.240\nSorry.\n\n01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:15.240\nHold on.\n\n01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.240\nShit.\n\n01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.240\nHad it a second ago.\n\n01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:21.240\nDo you want me to look?\n\n01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:25.240\nTouch deals 2d8 plus 1 damage per level.\n\n01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:26.240\nAll right.\n\n01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.240\n11.\n\n01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:29.240\nAll right, you hit him.\n\n01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:33.240\nNecrotic energy oozes through his body as he takes 11 damage.\n\n01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:38.240\nSorry, there's a verbal component to my spell.\n\n01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.240\nIt's okay.\n\n01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.240\nAll right.\n\n01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.240\nHow close am I to him?\n\n01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:46.240\nYou're maybe 10 feet, but you're kind of coming through the window.\n\n01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.240\nRight?\n\n01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:49.240\nCan I reach out and grab his shoulder?\n\n01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:51.240\nAre you inside the bathroom at this point?\n\n01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:52.240\nWell, my arm could be.\n\n01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.240\nIt's a hole.\n\n01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:54.240\nYou can't reach through.\n\n01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.240\nYou'd have to be in the bathroom to kind of reach him.\n\n01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:03.240\nMy hand is in the bathroom.\n\n01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.240\nSo no.\n\n01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.240\nRight.\n\n01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.240\nYou're not even going to roll.\n\n01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.240\nNo, you can't reach him.\n\n01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:14.240\nYou can move to him, and then you'd be able to reach him.\n\n01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.240\nMove the window?\n\n01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.240\nMove through the window.\n\n01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:19.240\nWell, I don't want to do that yet.\n\n01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.240\nAre there any rocks?\n\n01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.240\nYeah, there's some rocks.\n\n01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.240\nOutside?\n\n01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.240\nYeah.\n\n01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:25.240\nI start throwing rocks.\n\n01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:27.240\nAll right.\n\n01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:29.240\nYou got a critical fail.\n\n01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:30.240\nCritical fail?\n\n01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:31.240\nYeah.\n\n01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.240\nYou winged Jeff in the head with a rock.\n\n01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:34.240\nWhat?\n\n01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:36.240\nI didn't mean to wing you.\n\n01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:38.240\nYou hit him for five.\n\n01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:39.240\nI hit him.\n\n01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:42.240\nI take five damage, and he threw rocks through the window.\n\n01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.240\nHe was throwing rocks.\n\n01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:44.240\nWhat are you standing in the?\n\n01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.240\nHow big is this bathroom?\n\n01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.240\nIt's not big.\n\n01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:47.240\nWell, why did you?\n\n01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.240\nYou should have stood up.\n\n01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.240\nYou were just whipping rocks in the window.\n\n01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:56.240\nYou hurt him as much as the guy that stabbed me hurt me.\n\n01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:58.240\nI'm trying to help.\n\n01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.240\nI'm trying to help.\n\n01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.240\nI'm trying to help.\n\n01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:02.240\nCan I do it?\n\n01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:04.240\nYou were the one that said, stay outside.\n\n01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:11.240\nIs there anything natural inside that I can use and tangle?\n\n01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:12.240\nNot close enough.\n\n01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:13.240\nIt's too far away.\n\n01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.240\nOK.\n\n01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:21.240\nIt can't reach into the bathroom.\n\n01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:22.240\nShalely.\n\n01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:23.240\nAll right.\n\n01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:31.240\nI turn my cord of staff into a Shalely and just fucking whack him right in the head.\n\n01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:32.240\nAll right.\n\n01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:35.240\nYou hit him for seven damage in the head.\n\n01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.240\nThis guy's got to die soon, right?\n\n01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:39.240\nNot that soon.\n\n01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:40.240\nIs he OK?\n\n01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.240\nWhat's his status?\n\n01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:49.240\nHe's doing fine considering he took two, I'm not going to say strong attacks, but pretty solid connections.\n\n01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.240\nHe's dazzled and dazed and confused.\n\n01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:59.240\nI'm going to throw just one more rock, but I'm going to aim at his legs.\n\n01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.240\nYeah.\n\n01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:01.240\nMake it harder.\n\n01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:05.240\nI get out of the way because I have been hurt before.\n\n01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:06.240\nAll right.\n\n01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:07.240\nWell, first is everyone else's turn.\n\n01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:16.240\nSo Shrove, he kind of ducks down into a ball like a crouch, and then dark energy emanates out from him and covers the bathroom in darkness.\n\n01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:23.240\nOh, that's just what normally happens in a bathroom.\n\n01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:25.240\nLuckily, the window's open.\n\n01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:28.240\nOh, the darkness is spilling out of the window.\n\n01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.240\nDarkness is spilling out.\n\n01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.240\nYou can kind of dodge it.\n\n01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:33.240\nThat hasn't happened since the Super Bowl.\n\n01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:35.240\nHey, is it day out?\n\n01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:37.240\nIt's getting dark.\n\n01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:39.240\nBecause of the window?\n\n01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.240\nNo, no.\n\n01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:42.240\nSo he's cast darkness inside the bathroom?\n\n01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:44.240\nYeah, so you guys can't see so hot.\n\n01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:47.240\nAnd the darkness is leaking out of the window?\n\n01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:51.240\nYeah, as if it were like a very bright room with light leaking out, but dark.\n\n01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:53.240\nWait, hold on.\n\n01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:58.240\nThe door gets smashed in, but you can't really see because it's dark.\n\n01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:07.240\nSo a flash of light behind you kind of opens up, and you see a crush of people pressing in, but no one can really see so well.\n\n01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:11.240\nSo just there's, you know, it's like a cartoon scuffle right now.\n\n01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:13.240\nSomeone in here.\n\n01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:15.240\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:18.240\nThere's fists ablazing.\n\n01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.240\nThey're hitting you.\n\n01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:21.240\nThey're hitting everyone.\n\n01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.240\nChef me, I'm outside.\n\n01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.240\nI'm protected by the outside.\n\n01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.240\nThat's correct.\n\n01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:26.240\nThank you.\n\n01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:28.240\nYou keep throwing rocks at me.\n\n01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:29.240\nJust once.\n\n01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:32.240\nJust once.\n\n01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:33.240\nAll right.\n\n01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.240\nOnly two connect.\n\n01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:36.240\nOne hits Jeff and one hits Dan.\n\n01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.240\nWho?\n\n01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:38.240\nI'm safe.\n\n01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.240\nWho's Jeff?\n\n01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:41.240\nXP.\n\n01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:42.240\nXP.\n\n01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:43.240\nI get XP.\n\n01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:44.240\nDouble.\n\n01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:49.240\nI picture this bathroom like the size of an airplane bathroom.\n\n01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.240\nI'm picturing the size of like the rust against the metal.\n\n01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:55.240\nYeah.\n\n01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:57.240\nI want to get this guy out the window.\n\n01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.240\nYeah.\n\n01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.240\nAll right.\n\n01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:01.240\nI reach my hand in.\n\n01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:02.240\nYou do that.\n\n01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:03.240\nYeah.\n\n01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.240\nAnd I say, throw them to me.\n\n01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:05.240\nThrow them.\n\n01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:06.240\nYou guys can't really see.\n\n01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:08.240\nHow many hits do I take?\n\n01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:11.240\nYou took eight damage and Dan took four damage.\n\n01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:14.240\nSo how does this dark work?\n\n01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.240\nOkay.\n\n01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:16.240\nHard to see.\n\n01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:18.240\nThink about the opposite of light.\n\n01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.240\nWell, I mean, yeah.\n\n01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:21.240\nLike negative light.\n\n01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:22.240\nYeah.\n\n01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:27.240\nThere's, it's getting, it's like day outside, right?\n\n01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:28.240\nIt's kind of getting dark.\n\n01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:32.240\nSo if I light a match in this dark, it does nothing.\n\n01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:33.240\nYou don't know.\n\n01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:35.240\nYou've never tried that.\n\n01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:37.240\nI tried that.\n\n01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:38.240\nYou try it?\n\n01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:39.240\nYeah.\n\n01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.240\nIt does nothing.\n\n01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:42.240\nIt's too dark.\n\n01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.240\nIt's magic.\n\n01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:44.240\nYou got to try these things.\n\n01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:47.240\nThey didn't teach magic at art school?\n\n01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:48.240\nJesus.\n\n01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:49.240\nNo.\n\n01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:50.240\nOkay.\n\n01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:53.240\nI throw cards in there.\n\n01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:55.240\nI think it's Dan's turn now.\n\n01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:56.240\nOkay.\n\n01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:00.240\nWell, I'm grabbing where I think Shrove is and I'm going to shove him toward the window\n\n01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:04.240\nbecause I'm like, we got to get this guy out of here.\n\n01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:11.240\nAnd I'm kind of hoping and shoving him that I'm like, I kind of want to be like a badass,\n\n01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:15.240\nbut I know I'm not like, like I want to like hit it.\n\n01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:19.240\nNot only am I not avoiding hitting his head, like I kind of hope I do.\n\n01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:21.240\nLike I want to Steven's a golem.\n\n01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:25.240\nI know I can't, but I want to.\n\n01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:27.240\nSo you're grabbing him and you're doing what?\n\n01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:28.240\nYou're pushing him somewhere?\n\n01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:34.240\nGrabbing him and shoving him toward the window with the intent of getting him close enough\n\n01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:37.240\nto the window that Diarrhea Jr. out there can start grabbing him.\n\n01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:44.240\nAnd like my long-term goal is get him out, like get him incapacitated and shoved out the window.\n\n01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:46.240\nOkay.\n\n01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:47.240\nYeah.\n\n01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:53.240\nYou grab someone that you feel like might be him and you start ushering towards the window\n\n01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:56.240\nand as you do that, you take some more punches.\n\n01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:57.240\nGreat.\n\n01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.240\nOnly two of them hit.\n\n01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.240\nSo fun.\n\n01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:03.240\nI don't like the sound of somebody.\n\n01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:05.240\nYou take five damage off of that.\n\n01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:06.240\nDamn it.\n\n01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:10.240\nYou get to the window though.\n\n01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:11.240\nSo that's what?\n\n01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:12.240\n14 for you?\n\n01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:13.240\nYeah.\n\n01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:18.240\nYeah, I'm close to death in a sense.\n\n01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:19.240\nIn a sense.\n\n01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.240\nI have like eight left.\n\n01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:22.240\nThat's not bad.\n\n01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:25.240\nI mean, it's not great, but it's not bad.\n\n01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.240\nAll right.\n\n01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:27.240\nYou think he's to the window.\n\n01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.240\nYeah.\n\n01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:33.240\nOr you know you're to that window unless you got turned around somehow.\n\n01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.240\nGrab him, Diarrhea.\n\n01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.240\nI grab him.\n\n01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:40.240\nAll right.\n\n01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.240\nYou grab him.\n\n01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:44.240\nAnd I can't see anything because I'm looking into the dark.\n\n01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:45.240\nRight.\n\n01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:46.240\nYeah.\n\n01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:48.240\nBut behind me is daylight.\n\n01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:51.240\nDusk.\n\n01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:53.240\nHe's so offended.\n\n01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:54.240\nIt's not just daylight.\n\n01:50:54.240 --> 01:51:01.240\nHe's been four years learning how light works at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.\n\n01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:05.240\nHe's so mad at the idea of dark being able to.\n\n01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:06.240\nIt's not my idea.\n\n01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:09.240\nFor four years, 80 years ago.\n\n01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.240\nI know.\n\n01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:13.240\nBut you're like, let me get this straight.\n\n01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:15.240\nLike, yeah, it's magic.\n\n01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:16.240\nOkay.\n\n01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:17.240\nAll right.\n\n01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:19.240\nSo I start yanking on whatever, whoever I'm holding on.\n\n01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:20.240\nYou do that too.\n\n01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:25.240\nWhen I'm pulling and yanking and yanking and pulling.\n\n01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.240\nYeah.\n\n01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.240\nYeah.\n\n01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.240\nYou do that.\n\n01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.240\nYou get him about halfway out.\n\n01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:32.240\nYou don't get him full way out because you had bad footing or something like your back\n\n01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:33.240\nhurt or something like that.\n\n01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:34.240\nBut you get him halfway out.\n\n01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.240\nAnd I'm aware enough to be shouting the whole time.\n\n01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:38.240\nI don't know if this is him.\n\n01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:39.240\nWho is it?\n\n01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:40.240\nWho is it?\n\n01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:41.240\nBecause I don't want to.\n\n01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:42.240\nThat's probably a good call.\n\n01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.240\nYeah, it's your turn.\n\n01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:50.240\nI use my spell of light and I cast it on the ceiling.\n\n01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:55.240\nSo the object, the ceiling can shine like a torch, right?\n\n01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:57.240\nOh, just light, right?\n\n01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:58.240\nUh-huh.\n\n01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.240\nI cast light on the ceiling of the bathroom.\n\n01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:06.240\nYou cast it and you see the faintest of light pulses, but it's almost immediately wiped out.\n\n01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:09.240\nIt's not strong enough to pierce the magical darkness.\n\n01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:10.240\nOh, fuck me.\n\n01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:11.240\nGod damn it.\n\n01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:12.240\nThat's it.\n\n01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:13.240\nThat's all.\n\n01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:14.240\nYou can move.\n\n01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:16.240\nI just threw a poof.\n\n01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:20.240\nWell, at least in a meta sense, we now know you're not being shoved out a window.\n\n01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:21.240\nYeah, that's true.\n\n01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:25.240\nSo did we catch anything in that moment, Spencer?\n\n01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.240\nWhat did I?\n\n01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:30.240\nYou saw like a strobe-like flash of just a vicious melee.\n\n01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:34.240\nIt seems like most of the tavern people are just punching each other, but they're kind\n\n01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:35.240\nof punching in all directions.\n\n01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:37.240\nSo now the bathroom is just filled with people punching?\n\n01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:38.240\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:39.240\nIt's a madhouse.\n\n01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:42.240\nYou can't take two steps without catching a punch.\n\n01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:44.240\nIt's got the window.\n\n01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:45.240\nSo that's my turn.\n\n01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:46.240\nNo, you can move.\n\n01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:48.240\nI jump out the fucking window.\n\n01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.240\nAll right.\n\n01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:50.240\nYou also get punched a couple of times.\n\n01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:51.240\nOh, you get punched.\n\n01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:53.240\nI start grabbing and yanking him.\n\n01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:54.240\nOkay.\n\n01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:57.240\nHow much d do I t?\n\n01:52:57.240 --> 01:53:00.240\nIt just, they don't hurt that bad.\n\n01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:04.240\nYou take some, like their wrist isn't straight or something, like it doesn't connect.\n\n01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:05.240\nSounds like that was our title.\n\n01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:08.240\nHow much d do I t?\n\n01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.240\nTheir wrist isn't straight.\n\n01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:11.240\nI don't know.\n\n01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:13.240\nI think you're actually supposed to keep it bent or something.\n\n01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:14.240\nNow that I said that.\n\n01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:18.240\nRemember when you found out when you were a kid, you're not supposed to keep your thumb\n\n01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:19.240\ntucked in your hand?\n\n01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:20.240\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:21.240\nYou punch somebody.\n\n01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:22.240\nSo you break your thumb.\n\n01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:25.240\nGod forbid I punch someone so hard I hurt myself.\n\n01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:27.240\nLike, what a problem.\n\n01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:30.240\nThat's how you t d.\n\n01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:32.240\nThat is how you t d.\n\n01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:36.240\nI think I punched someone once.\n\n01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:37.240\nThat's not true.\n\n01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:38.240\nI punched a lot of people.\n\n01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:39.240\nDamn.\n\n01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:40.240\nThey were little kids too.\n\n01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:41.240\nWhat do you think about that?\n\n01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.240\nThat's badass.\n\n01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:43.240\nAnd this was last week.\n\n01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:45.240\nI punched a lot of fucking little kids.\n\n01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:46.240\nAll right.\n\n01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:47.240\nSo this is our turn.\n\n01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:51.240\nOr is it the NPC bad guy's turn?\n\n01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.240\nBut it's Dan's turn.\n\n01:53:53.240 --> 01:54:00.240\nDan, you're, you are kind of sandwiched between, you think is Shrove and Rob Schrab and Jeff is\n\n01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:01.240\nkind of in the mix there too.\n\n01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.240\nWe got to get Shrove out this window.\n\n01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:05.240\nRight.\n\n01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:06.240\nOut of this melee.\n\n01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:07.240\nYeah.\n\n01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:12.240\nMy goal, my long term goal is if that dude was Shrove, which I'm not questioning, I'm\n\n01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:17.240\njust like, I grabbed that person shoving them like a package out the window.\n\n01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:19.240\nAnd my hope is to go out after them.\n\n01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:22.240\nBecause I ain't going out through the bathroom door.\n\n01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:23.240\nYeah.\n\n01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.240\nSo you do that.\n\n01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:33.040\nYou push, you push the guy through and the window is now clear for access if you want\n\n01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:34.040\nto squeeze through.\n\n01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:35.040\nThat's what I'm doing.\n\n01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.040\nYou do that.\n\n01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:37.040\nEasy access.\n\n01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.240\nYou take one more punch on the butt and you take six damage.\n\n01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:40.240\nOw!\n\n01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.240\nThat's like, that brings me close to death.\n\n01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:43.240\nSix butt damage.\n\n01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:46.240\nSomeone punched me in the ass and might have killed me.\n\n01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:48.240\nI start laughing and pointing.\n\n01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:51.240\nI have, I have some heel spells and some good berries.\n\n01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:53.240\nThe most lethal butt punch.\n\n01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:57.240\nThe punch of the butt caused more damage than when the guy stabbed me.\n\n01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:58.240\nAnd I'm.\n\n01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:00.240\nAnd when my friend threw a rock through the window.\n\n01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:05.240\nI'm laughing, but I'm saying, it's not funny.\n\n01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:07.240\nI know it's not funny.\n\n01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:08.240\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:09.240\nIt's not funny.\n\n01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:10.240\nYou're right.\n\n01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:11.240\nIt's not funny.\n\n01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.240\nI hope you don't die from getting punched in the butt.\n\n01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:16.240\nOw!\n\n01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:17.240\nMy ass!\n\n01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:24.240\nHey, you got punched where the sun don't shine because it's dark in that bathroom because\n\n01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:27.240\nhe did his foul.\n\n01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:32.240\nI'm hanging out the window like crying blood because someone.\n\n01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.240\nI know it's terrible.\n\n01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.240\nI'm really sorry.\n\n01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:36.240\nI take them by the hand.\n\n01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:37.240\nMy balls are black.\n\n01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:38.240\nHelping them.\n\n01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:43.240\nI'm like one of those kids from that horrible orphanage.\n\n01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:44.240\nI'm not laughing at you.\n\n01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:46.240\nI'm laughing at the situation.\n\n01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:48.240\nIt's not your fault.\n\n01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:50.240\nGod damn.\n\n01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:56.240\nHow are we doing this for the church?\n\n01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:57.240\nAm I outside?\n\n01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:01.240\nNo, it's your turn and you can be outside on your turn.\n\n01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:02.240\nI try to jump outside.\n\n01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:03.240\nAll right, you do that.\n\n01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:05.240\nThis window is like a Lily Tomlin.\n\n01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:06.240\nCan you see?\n\n01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:08.240\nCan you see outside?\n\n01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:09.240\nCan you see outside?\n\n01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.240\nNow that you're clear of the window and it's not blasting out darkness.\n\n01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:15.240\nDo we have Shrove or do we not?\n\n01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.240\nYou do.\n\n01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.240\nYeah, we got Shrove.\n\n01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:18.240\nHell yeah.\n\n01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:19.240\nSo we got Shrove.\n\n01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:20.240\nWe're all outside now.\n\n01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:21.240\nWe should rough him up.\n\n01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.240\nYeah.\n\n01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:23.240\nNo, we should beat the piss out of him.\n\n01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:26.240\nYou should rough him up a bit and go, hey, you think that's funny?\n\n01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:28.240\nYou're making it dark in the bathroom?\n\n01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:29.240\nNo, we need to.\n\n01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:31.240\nMy friend got punched in the butt.\n\n01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:33.240\nWait, is it my turn?\n\n01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:36.240\nYou have an action, but you can't move.\n\n01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:38.240\nI can't do a spell.\n\n01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:39.240\nNo, you can do a spell.\n\n01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:46.240\nI throw, I summon nature's ally and throw a bear into the bathroom.\n\n01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:49.240\nSo they have to deal with that.\n\n01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:50.240\nNicely done.\n\n01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.240\nVery good.\n\n01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:52.240\nThat goes great.\n\n01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:54.240\nI summon the bear.\n\n01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.240\nFantastic.\n\n01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:56.240\nAnd it's still dark in there.\n\n01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:57.240\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:58.240\nOkay.\n\n01:56:58.240 --> 01:56:59.240\nAfter he does that, I know it's not my turn.\n\n01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:05.240\nI'm going to close the window.\n\n01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:12.240\nSo we get a full-on bear in the fucking bathroom and we're going to bone out with Shrove.\n\n01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:14.240\nAnd I'm covering Shrove like with my body.\n\n01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:16.240\nI'm just going to say I just don't want him to get away.\n\n01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.240\nRight.\n\n01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:18.240\nOkay.\n\n01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:20.240\nSo did I successfully cast a bear into the bathroom?\n\n01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:21.240\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:22.240\nIt's tearing shit off.\n\n01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:23.240\nAll right.\n\n01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:25.240\nThere's a fucking guy out of here.\n\n01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:27.240\nThe toilet keeps flushing.\n\n01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.240\nThese guys are going to be busy for a while with that bear.\n\n01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:36.240\nI heard him flushing in the toilet.\n\n01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:37.240\nLet's get Shrove.\n\n01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:38.240\nThis guy's a friend of the town.\n\n01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:39.240\nWe're going to go somewhere.\n\n01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:40.240\nI know.\n\n01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:41.240\nLet's take him up.\n\n01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:42.240\nWe got to rough him up a bit.\n\n01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:44.240\nYou know, I grab him by the arm and I start shaking him.\n\n01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:45.240\nWe're going to get him out of here.\n\n01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:46.240\nWe're in the street.\n\n01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:47.240\nWhat the fuck is?\n\n01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:48.240\nWe got to get him out of here.\n\n01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.240\nWe got to get you out of here.\n\n01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:54.240\nI look around to see if there's a place that we can hide ourselves.\n\n01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:56.240\nWe got to hide you somewhere.\n\n01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:58.240\nWe got to get you out of here.\n\n01:57:58.240 --> 01:57:59.240\nWhat are you doing back there?\n\n01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:01.240\nHow long do you think a bear is going to last\n\n01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:03.240\nwith X amount of people in a bathroom?\n\n01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:04.240\n10 rounds.\n\n01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:05.240\nHow many rounds?\n\n01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:07.240\n10 rounds they'll never forget.\n\n01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:08.240\nWe got 10 rounds.\n\n01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:09.240\nWe're fine.\n\n01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:10.240\nThey're going to be giving bumper stickers\n\n01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.240\nfor finishing the night in that place.\n\n01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:13.240\nWe can get him.\n\n01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:14.240\nGet this guy out of here.\n\n01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:15.240\nOut of here.\n\n01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:16.240\nYeah.\n\n01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:18.240\nSo you're behind the market.\n\n01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:21.240\nYou're kind of between the back row of the market buildings\n\n01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.240\nand then the outer wall of the town.\n\n01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:25.240\nSo it's kind of a natural alley.\n\n01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:29.240\nBut it's also like it's in an area that's heavily populated.\n\n01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:31.240\nSo unless like you get somewhere out of line of sight\n\n01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.240\nor something.\n\n01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:36.240\nWhat am I wearing?\n\n01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:38.240\nAny kind of robe?\n\n01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:39.240\nIs he wearing colorful clothes like me?\n\n01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:40.240\nYeah.\n\n01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:41.240\nYou're wearing colorful clothes.\n\n01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:42.240\nLike a robe.\n\n01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:43.240\nGod, is it brilliant?\n\n01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:44.240\nYeah.\n\n01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:45.240\nNo.\n\n01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:47.240\nIt's like a clown costume.\n\n01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:48.240\nOK.\n\n01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:51.240\nHe's going to put his jacket over Shrove's head.\n\n01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:52.240\nYeah.\n\n01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:53.240\nThis is brilliant.\n\n01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:55.240\nIn fact, also I got the robe.\n\n01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:56.240\nI got the Shrove robe.\n\n01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.240\nI bought the Shrove robe from the homeless guy.\n\n01:58:58.240 --> 01:58:59.240\nRight.\n\n01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:00.240\nYeah.\n\n01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:01.240\nTake that.\n\n01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:02.240\nWrap his head in that.\n\n01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:03.240\nShrove robe.\n\n01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:05.240\nThe bloody Shrove robe.\n\n01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:06.240\nWhatever you want.\n\n01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.240\nYeah.\n\n01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:08.240\nRight.\n\n01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:09.240\nWrap his head.\n\n01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.240\nLike paparazzi avoidance style.\n\n01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:11.240\nI start shouting.\n\n01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:13.240\nEverybody out of the way.\n\n01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:15.240\nUgliest man in the world.\n\n01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:16.240\nYou don't want to see this.\n\n01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.240\nHe's so ugly.\n\n01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:18.240\nDon't.\n\n01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:19.240\nEverybody.\n\n01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:20.240\nWe have a chance.\n\n01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:23.240\nI pat Shrove down to see what's on him.\n\n01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:24.240\nHe's got a dagger.\n\n01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:25.240\nA dagger.\n\n01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:26.240\nI take the dagger.\n\n01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:27.240\nTake the dagger.\n\n01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:28.240\nHe stabs it.\n\n01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:29.240\nWhat?\n\n01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:30.240\nI took the dagger.\n\n01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:32.240\nNo, you're reaching for it.\n\n01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:33.240\nOh.\n\n01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:34.240\nYeah, he stabbed him.\n\n01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:35.240\nFucking hell.\n\n01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:37.240\nI shake his other arm and I go, what are you doing?\n\n01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:39.240\nHow many, how many of these do I tease?\n\n01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:40.240\nFive damage.\n\n01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:41.240\nFive people.\n\n01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:42.240\nFive more, five more of these?\n\n01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:43.240\nFive more damage.\n\n01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:44.240\nFucking hell.\n\n01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:45.240\nI shake him.\n\n01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:46.240\nI shake him.\n\n01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.240\nWhy are you stabbing people?\n\n01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:50.240\nYou pull it out of his hand after that, though.\n\n01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:52.240\nBecause of the arm shaking.\n\n01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:55.240\nWe need to incapacitate this guy.\n\n01:59:55.240 --> 02:00:00.240\nWhy don't you punch him in the butt and almost kill him?\n\n02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:05.240\nHe goes, what are you guys, what is this?\n\n02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:07.240\nYou're not taking me alive.\n\n02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:08.240\nI'm going to kill you.\n\n02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:12.240\nHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, dagger guy, long pooper.\n\n02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:14.240\nDo you have passions, Jim?\n\n02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.240\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:20.240\nWe're trying to find passions, Jim.\n\n02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:23.240\nThat sounds like, is that a famous person?\n\n02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:26.240\nThe Jim you prick, you fucking waylaid us on the highway,\n\n02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:29.240\ncoming from a little, little knock.\n\n02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:33.240\nWe're the fuck, my character would remember this stuff.\n\n02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:36.240\nDon't fucking lie to us.\n\n02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:37.240\nYeah, don't waylaid us.\n\n02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:39.240\nI've been here for months.\n\n02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:40.240\nI'm like the town doctor.\n\n02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:41.240\nI don't, I don't leave.\n\n02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:44.240\nLike I have a lot of chronic patients and stuff.\n\n02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:46.240\nI'm not just going around hanging out.\n\n02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:47.240\nWhere did you get this robe?\n\n02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.240\nYou piece of shit.\n\n02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:50.240\nI found it at the theater.\n\n02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:52.240\nYou work at the theater.\n\n02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.240\nRight, yeah.\n\n02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:55.240\nAnd so I was like, well, this bloody robe seems too dirty\n\n02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:57.240\nto be with the other costume.\n\n02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:59.240\nI'm going to get rid of this.\n\n02:00:59.240 -->
