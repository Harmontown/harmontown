{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:20.560\nHello everybody, welcome to Meltdown in Hollywood, California.\n\n00:20.560 --> 00:38.680\nWelcome to the stage of the mayor of Hymen Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:38.680 --> 00:42.840\nHappy St. Patrick's Day aftermath, right?\n\n00:42.840 --> 00:43.840\nYou're a little hungover, Jeff?\n\n00:43.840 --> 00:47.040\nYeah, I got pretty drunk last night.\n\n00:47.040 --> 00:52.480\nI spent the entire day on the couch eating, overeating, and watching David Attenborough\n\n00:52.480 --> 00:55.480\nanimal documentaries.\n\n00:55.480 --> 01:00.160\nAaron and I coincidentally have been watching a lot of the John Hurt, what's it, Human\n\n01:00.160 --> 01:01.160\nPlanet?\n\n01:01.160 --> 01:06.080\nIt's one of the John Hurt narrates, I think, in the beginning of the title sequence.\n\n01:06.080 --> 01:13.160\nHe goes, there's only one animal that makes total use of the whole planet and does whatever\n\n01:13.160 --> 01:14.160\nit wants.\n\n01:14.160 --> 01:15.160\nSomething like that.\n\n01:15.160 --> 01:16.160\nThat's not really...\n\n01:16.160 --> 01:18.920\nIt's better written than that.\n\n01:18.920 --> 01:24.160\nBut I always, at the end of it, I compulsively have to go, me, John Hurt.\n\n01:24.160 --> 01:29.600\nJust thought I'd share that with you.\n\n01:29.600 --> 01:30.600\nIt's kind of a...\n\n01:30.600 --> 01:36.760\nIt's interesting, I thought I knew mostly everything about why I should be proud of\n\n01:36.760 --> 01:41.880\npeople and being one of them, because usually you're being told by the television to be\n\n01:41.880 --> 01:46.000\nashamed of being human, and there's a lot of reasons to be ashamed if you want to dwell\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:47.000\non that.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:50.160\nFor instance, we rape people.\n\n01:50.160 --> 01:52.400\nWe murder each other.\n\n01:52.400 --> 01:55.920\nWe are destroying the whole thing, whatever.\n\n01:55.920 --> 02:00.640\nWe're doing all kinds of terrible things to ourselves and each other, and I always find\n\n02:00.640 --> 02:07.440\nit ironic and heroic to try to focus on, yeah, but kind of a cool, awkward monkey species\n\n02:07.440 --> 02:15.600\nthat sort of rose to prominence, and there's an underdog story there.\n\n02:15.600 --> 02:16.600\nI thought I had...\n\n02:16.600 --> 02:17.600\nA long time ago.\n\n02:17.600 --> 02:18.600\nI thought I kind of...\n\n02:18.600 --> 02:23.560\nWell, no, not really, not at all, not in the timescale that matters, not if you're telling\n\n02:23.560 --> 02:30.640\nthat story, if you're telling a story about species, we are in the opening of the third\n\n02:30.640 --> 02:32.360\nact of the Bad News Bears.\n\n02:32.360 --> 02:33.520\nWe're not even...\n\n02:33.520 --> 02:34.520\nIt's not...\n\n02:34.520 --> 02:39.480\nBut the Bad News Bears lose that game.\n\n02:39.480 --> 02:42.480\nI never saw it, I don't know.\n\n02:42.480 --> 02:50.000\nBut we're watching this John Hurt thing, Human Planet.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:59.480\nThese guys, I'm assuming it's in Africa, I think that's where lions are.\n\n02:59.480 --> 03:05.800\nThey get food by waiting for lions to attack, like an animal, like a gazelle or something,\n\n03:05.800 --> 03:11.080\nand then they have this technique, like John Hurt teased it up and goes, they've got an\n\n03:11.080 --> 03:16.040\ninteresting technique, but first they have to wait for the lion to make its kill.\n\n03:16.040 --> 03:19.360\nAnd I'm like, okay, what is there going to be some weird thing, like a fishing pole and\n\n03:19.360 --> 03:22.120\nthen like a $20 bill on the end of a line?\n\n03:22.120 --> 03:23.960\nIt's not Vincent Price narrating that?\n\n03:23.960 --> 03:28.080\nNo, no, it's not, it's not Hurt.\n\n03:28.080 --> 03:31.840\nAnd I don't do an impression of either of them, so I can understand your confusion.\n\n03:31.840 --> 03:36.000\nOh, these are the guys that just sneak up and just scare the lions off.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:37.000\nNo, they don't...\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:45.080\nOkay, I want to stress that they don't sneak up, the whole thing is they just roll up.\n\n03:45.080 --> 03:50.880\nThey just kind of walk up like they're going to get a paper.\n\n03:50.880 --> 03:55.640\nAnd then part of the gimmick of this show is that all these people that you're visiting\n\n03:55.640 --> 03:58.000\naround all the corners of the earth, they all have their own language, you don't know\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:02.160\nwhat the hell they're saying, that these subtitles, they're modern subtitles because\n\n04:02.160 --> 04:06.480\nthey kind of float in their key frames a little bit, they float a little bit, they float a\n\n04:06.480 --> 04:08.840\nfew pixels to the right as the people are saying them.\n\n04:08.840 --> 04:15.000\nBut the weird thing is, none of the people, like if these subtitles are actual translations,\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:19.200\nAmerica is the only place that has any linguistic nuance at all.\n\n04:19.200 --> 04:24.320\nEveryone, everywhere else, if there's a guy climbing a tree to get to honey, he only ever\n\n04:24.320 --> 04:31.800\nsays like, I found bees up here with honey, there's lots of honey in here.\n\n04:31.800 --> 04:36.360\nThat's what he would say to his friends after 20 years of doing this, he doesn't have any\n\n04:36.360 --> 04:37.360\nfucking lingo.\n\n04:37.360 --> 04:38.360\nYeah.\n\n04:38.360 --> 04:40.360\nWe did it again, hot chat.\n\n04:40.360 --> 04:41.360\nYeah.\n\n04:41.360 --> 04:42.360\nCome on, baby.\n\n04:42.360 --> 04:46.240\nYeah, daddy needs to do a pair of shoes.\n\n04:46.240 --> 04:49.720\nWe should be asking ourselves when we see the subtitles, what the fuck's going on?\n\n04:49.720 --> 04:52.320\nEven though it's translated into English, it's still like, oh, I get it, he's been doing\n\n04:52.320 --> 04:53.320\nthis for a while.\n\n04:53.320 --> 04:57.760\nBut everyone just keeps going, there's the lions, now we make our move.\n\n04:57.760 --> 05:02.840\nAnd these guys, two guys, they just stand up out of the bushes, and there's 20 lions.\n\n05:02.840 --> 05:06.920\nAnd they're like, damn, they have blood on their faces, because they're just mushing\n\n05:06.920 --> 05:10.600\ntheir faces into dead gazelle and just eating them.\n\n05:10.600 --> 05:14.480\nSome of them have manes, and the other ones don't.\n\n05:14.480 --> 05:19.040\nI think there's some significance there among them, but the point is like, picture any kind\n\n05:19.040 --> 05:23.240\nof lion, picture anything, these aren't scrawny lions, these are like zoo lions, these are\n\n05:23.240 --> 05:30.040\nbig fat fucking scary giant lions, like the kind you would get a wax sculpture of out\n\n05:30.040 --> 05:32.320\nof a machine.\n\n05:32.320 --> 05:36.360\nAnd there's 15 of them, 15 of them.\n\n05:36.360 --> 05:39.560\nWhat machine dispenses waxed lions?\n\n05:39.560 --> 05:41.080\nThat's not a universal thing?\n\n05:41.080 --> 05:42.080\nNo.\n\n05:42.080 --> 05:46.240\nOh, okay, well, the Milwaukee County Zoo had these machines.\n\n05:46.240 --> 05:50.600\nI assumed there was a regular thing, I'm sorry.\n\n05:50.600 --> 05:52.320\nGo to the Milwaukee County Zoo, it's actually...\n\n05:52.320 --> 05:54.760\nThe machine makes a waxed lion?\n\n05:54.760 --> 05:59.480\nThey have a machine, they used to anyway, at the Milwaukee County Zoo, there was a machine\n\n05:59.480 --> 06:06.000\nalmost every exhibit almost, like every kind of category, like there was a penguin and there\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:11.520\nwas a lion, there was a giraffe, like if you went there, they kind of draw you in and put\n\n06:11.520 --> 06:17.360\na quarter in or a dollar, I'm sure it inflated, but when I was a kid, it was a machine that\n\n06:17.360 --> 06:22.160\nwould, really none of what I'm about to tell you is going to make a lot of sense to modern\n\n06:22.160 --> 06:29.120\nears, but this was before the internet, and also before I hit puberty, so it made sense\n\n06:29.120 --> 06:34.400\nto me, there was a big machine, and you put coins in it, and it was kind of transparent\n\n06:34.400 --> 06:38.400\nwhat it was doing, and a lot of tubes and metal things in it, and you would put enough\n\n06:38.400 --> 06:44.080\ncoins in it and it would go, and these metal things would come together, and then like\n\n06:44.080 --> 06:58.320\ncolored wax would, plastic would go through these tubes into this thing, and it would\n\n06:58.320 --> 07:05.880\ndrop a hot, dangerous, melted plastic lion into a tray that the machine very specifically\n\n07:05.880 --> 07:11.400\ntold you, a la McDonald's giving you an apple pie, like your fault if you, somebody in the\n\n07:11.400 --> 07:17.320\nfront row is holding it, it gave me a picture of one that he got, he googled, try to enjoy\n\n07:17.320 --> 07:23.400\nthe show, stop googling, so it's an injection molding machine that makes you a lion, or\n\n07:23.400 --> 07:32.160\nit's a hot plastic injection, as Judd Nelson would say, do you want to get a hot plastic\n\n07:32.160 --> 07:33.160\ninjection later on?\n\n07:33.160 --> 07:42.520\nDid he give you the hot plastic injection, leave me alone, see this is what you get when\n\n07:42.520 --> 07:50.520\nyou spill paint in the garage, your dad molds a plastic giraffe on you, it very specifically\n\n07:50.520 --> 07:54.320\ntells you how you're allowed to hold it, because there's holes in the bottom of it, and that's\n\n07:54.320 --> 07:59.640\nwhere the plastic goes, like that's the umbilical point for the mother plastic machine, and if\n\n07:59.640 --> 08:07.560\nyou hold it the wrong way, ostensibly melting molten plastic would drip on your child hands,\n\n08:07.560 --> 08:15.120\nrendering them forever claw like, you would become like this weird self-loathing phantom\n\n08:15.120 --> 08:22.600\nof the zoo, the feeding goats out of your weird useless flipper, come here, come here,\n\n08:22.600 --> 08:26.880\nI'm here because I have to be, I once came because I loved it, now I have nowhere else\n\n08:26.880 --> 08:34.480\nto go, no woman will touch me in the parking lot, I turned into Peter Lorre, I took on\n\n08:34.480 --> 08:41.040\na weird accent that can't be traced, it can't be traced, Rick, Steepie, Steepie, Steepie,\n\n08:41.040 --> 08:48.920\nwhere am I from Steepie, um, anyways, tonight's going to be a tangent free night, I don't\n\n08:48.920 --> 08:55.160\nwant to get off on anything, tonight's show is called Focus, so when I tell you there\n\n08:55.160 --> 09:02.160\nwere 20 lions burrowing their faces into this killout, because I used that handy reference\n\n09:02.160 --> 09:12.000\nto that plastic molding machine, you guys know exactly what I mean by 20 lions, I completely\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:17.560\nforgotten what you were talking about, but imagine this too, here's the thing about lions\n\n09:17.560 --> 09:26.000\nin the wild, you know, they're kind of getting no pun intended, I guess pun intended, but\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:36.800\nalso no pun celebrated, they're getting catty with each other, they're eating the gazelle,\n\n09:36.800 --> 09:43.960\nI said not celebrated, lady, I couldn't have put a bigger disclaimer on that, I connected\n\n09:43.960 --> 09:47.920\nthe dots, I proceeded as usual, I did everything I needed to do, I got in the airlock, I took\n\n09:47.920 --> 09:56.600\na deep breath, I told everyone what was happening, I said catty, some lady, it's a pun, I know\n\n09:56.600 --> 10:03.520\nit's an accident, I'm not going to censor myself, so these lions like they're eating\n\n10:03.520 --> 10:10.000\nand they're in a mode, they're at a point in their day and their lives where even another\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:18.000\nlion is pissing them off, they're like this is a good femur muscle, someone's like is\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:22.040\nthe muscle good, you want to try some of the spleen, and it's like I know you're just saying\n\n10:22.040 --> 10:25.920\nthat because you're going to want the femur muscle, I don't know, I don't want the spleen,\n\n10:25.920 --> 10:29.560\nif I wanted the spleen I wouldn't have started eating the femur muscle, you know what I\n\n10:29.560 --> 10:30.560\nmean?\n\n10:30.560 --> 10:37.600\nIs that only my pet peeve when you go to eat with your girlfriend, she's like how is the\n\n10:37.600 --> 10:42.440\nduck, and you're like the duck's fine, and I just did my head, I just see the chess\n\n10:42.440 --> 10:50.400\ngame, you want to try the duck, and you don't bite on it because you come from a family\n\n10:50.400 --> 10:57.720\nof four people that guarded their food, so then they go, God this chicken, you want to\n\n10:57.720 --> 10:58.720\ntry some of the chicken?\n\n10:58.720 --> 11:03.640\nNo I don't want to try the chicken, I know it's a fucking setup, you want to get into\n\n11:03.640 --> 11:12.720\na food exchange where the net result is you get my duck, but I ordered right, I win dinner.\n\n11:12.720 --> 11:16.520\nSo when you take your losses, eat your chicken.\n\n11:16.520 --> 11:21.760\nWhen you watch a documentary about lions over a carcass, you connect the dots to you having\n\n11:21.760 --> 11:22.760\ndinner with your girlfriend?\n\n11:22.760 --> 11:28.280\nNo, I just connected those dots now, what I'm telling you is that well in order to explain\n\n11:28.280 --> 11:35.400\nto you what the state of affairs of these lions grazing over this gazelle, they're\n\n11:35.400 --> 11:39.760\nnot being polite, they're not lulled into a state of graciousness.\n\n11:39.760 --> 11:45.360\nThese are lions at the height of their lioness, they're like so mad that another lion could\n\n11:45.360 --> 11:50.920\nbite, they're like going, I'm eating, I'm eating, I'm eating.\n\n11:50.920 --> 11:58.680\nSo into that frame, marches these two fucking idiots with blankets for shirts, they got\n\n11:58.680 --> 12:05.720\nnothing, they don't have special lion guns or rocks that they know make a lion choke.\n\n12:05.720 --> 12:08.760\nThey have sticks and what they have is eye contact and they just start walking up.\n\n12:08.760 --> 12:15.480\nJust a gate, just a G-A-I-T gate, they just stand up for the bush and they don't make\n\n12:15.480 --> 12:21.160\na sound, they don't go like, hey lion lion lion lion, they don't go whoop whoop whoop\n\n12:21.160 --> 12:25.600\nwhoop whoop whoop, nothing like that, they just silently walk up like, well they used\n\n12:25.600 --> 12:29.200\nto carry a G-A-T-E gate and just make it seem like they were separated by us.\n\n12:29.200 --> 12:32.520\nYeah, they just slowly pretend like they lived there, oh another piece of junk mail, oh,\n\n12:32.520 --> 12:38.360\nhey what are you guys doing in my front yard?\n\n12:38.360 --> 12:45.240\nThey slowly change their address by one digit, no, they walk, and the fucking 15\n\n12:45.240 --> 12:50.120\nlions, they bone out, they all go like, these guys mean business.\n\n12:50.120 --> 12:53.920\nAnd these guys quickly carve off and then John Hurt goes like, they have to work quickly\n\n12:53.920 --> 13:03.960\nbecause the lions will catch onto their bluff, hey wait a minute, those are upright walking\n\n13:03.960 --> 13:09.920\npriming, that's more food that just stole our food, you know that you're hungry when\n\n13:09.920 --> 13:13.320\nyou're chasing lions off a kill, like you have to be starving.\n\n13:13.320 --> 13:17.680\nAnd then they sling it over their shoulder, like they're walking out of a deli, like a\n\n13:17.680 --> 13:24.040\nbad deli, because a good deli would give you a bag, but this is Africa, like they just\n\n13:24.040 --> 13:27.840\nwent Christmas tree shopping, they sling it up like, yeah, I think they don't run off,\n\n13:27.840 --> 13:33.640\nthey just cruise out like, just walk away, just walk away, and then they're like around\n\n13:33.640 --> 13:39.640\na campfire and then the subtitles say like, we got lucky with those lions today, they\n\n13:39.640 --> 13:43.240\ndidn't know they could have eaten us, that could have gone totally bad.\n\n13:43.240 --> 13:49.200\nAnd they'll do it again next Wednesday, but I'm just very impressed with human beings.\n\n13:49.200 --> 13:56.440\nThen there's another one where there's like these, god damn it, what is it, it's, hey\n\n13:56.440 --> 14:03.000\nAaron, what is it, was it pigeons or something in the trees, what's the thing in, there's\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:09.240\nthose birds that, I don't want to spoil the ending, you know what I'm talking about?\n\n14:09.240 --> 14:13.480\nYeah, yeah, okay, there's like these locust like birds, they're basically like the avian\n\n14:13.480 --> 14:18.160\nequivalent of locusts when they eat everything, so again, it's just these guys that just hang\n\n14:18.160 --> 14:22.920\nout and they're like, but now these are birds that'll eat their crops, so like, but the\n\n14:22.920 --> 14:27.960\nhumans have developed a different solution to their bird problem, at the end of the night\n\n14:27.960 --> 14:34.800\nthe birds must go home to their nests, where the humans have prepared a rather clever trick\n\n14:34.800 --> 14:40.680\nthat they just show them like unspooling, well it looks like cable, I'm like wait, this\n\n14:40.680 --> 14:45.560\nisn't, they're not spearing dung on their heads, and like, this isn't a symbiotic relationship,\n\n14:45.560 --> 14:50.800\nthose look like canisters of gasoline, and then they just show like A-teaming, like he's\n\n14:50.800 --> 14:54.720\nbringing these cheese, and then it's like a joke, it's like a British sitcom or something,\n\n14:54.720 --> 15:00.200\nlike the birds all fly to the nest, so then it cuts to a wide shot, and they go, brrrr,\n\n15:00.200 --> 15:06.560\nthe entire forest explodes, and then they move on to the next subject, on the shores\n\n15:06.560 --> 15:13.040\nof Scotland, humans love to ride segues, it doesn't, there's no, he doesn't comment\n\n15:13.040 --> 15:19.320\non it, it's nothing like, human beings, ah, that plucky species, those birds are getting\n\n15:19.320 --> 15:26.240\nout of hand, it just blew up the forest, they'll have to do it again next Wednesday, very interesting\n\n15:26.240 --> 15:29.880\nspecies, and I don't think, I think it's important to embrace it and say, you know what, you're\n\n15:29.880 --> 15:35.120\nalright, humanity, you're alright, um, if you could be another animal, like in terms\n\n15:35.120 --> 15:41.520\nof, like, I would kill myself, I would be a suicidal porpoise, I would purposely go\n\n15:41.520 --> 15:48.960\nout of my way to find the places where people dispose of those six-pack rings, and not cut\n\n15:48.960 --> 15:54.240\nthem responsibly, so I could hang myself, could you have a choice, are you a predator,\n\n15:54.240 --> 15:59.920\na scavenger, a victim, herbivore, carnivore, I would, I mean, can I be an autotrofe, can\n\n15:59.920 --> 16:07.440\nI be a photosynthetic, kind of, just, like, mushroom, no, animal, animal, well, no, it\n\n16:07.440 --> 16:13.680\ncould be an insect, bird, alright, alright, alright, okay, I think I would, boy, oh boy,\n\n16:13.680 --> 16:16.880\nI mean, there's, there's hundreds of species in the world, you know it seems like they\n\n16:16.880 --> 16:24.880\ngot it right, 20 of them, undiscovered, manatees, manatees, they cruise around, they graze\n\n16:24.880 --> 16:29.240\non grass, and nobody eats them, because they're too big and fat, and no one fucks with a manatee,\n\n16:29.240 --> 16:32.080\nthey just, like, cruise around, yeah, well there is stuff like that, like, at the top\n\n16:32.080 --> 16:35.520\nof the food chain, that's nice, like, they're herbivores, they're vegetarians, and nobody\n\n16:35.520 --> 16:40.960\neats them, because they're giant, fat people, yeah, and they, why are you raising your\n\n16:40.960 --> 16:49.480\nhand, this is GS, you got one? Yeah, they get hit by propellers, oh yeah, yeah, okay,\n\n16:49.480 --> 16:55.600\nwell, that's true, I mean, everyone, I think, I think the assumption is that you wouldn't\n\n16:55.600 --> 16:59.480\nhave a manatee brain, right, you would, you would be like, you would be like Albert Brooks\n\n16:59.480 --> 17:06.320\nas a manatee, going like, oh boy, yeah, this is neurotic about this, like, I would assume\n\n17:06.320 --> 17:09.280\nthat you'd see a propeller and go, I don't want none of that, I wouldn't choose to be\n\n17:09.280 --> 17:13.880\na neurotic manatee, I would choose, I'm just saying, I'd be Alec Baldwin as a manatee,\n\n17:13.880 --> 17:18.480\nyou'd have a voiceover, you'd have a celebrity voiceover, you'd have an intelligent manatee\n\n17:18.480 --> 17:22.600\nthat had, like, a kind of a dialogue with the audience, you'd be like, I'd be a Bruce\n\n17:22.600 --> 17:29.600\nWillis manatee, I'd be like, you know, all things considered, I'd rather be Philadelphia,\n\n17:29.600 --> 17:41.680\nthan those estuaries, yeah, oh boy, look, a propeller for me, fool me twice, come to\n\n17:41.680 --> 17:53.840\nMiami, hang out in the channel, I would be, I would be, or you could be a Liam Neeson\n\n17:53.840 --> 18:02.080\nmanatee, sorry, no, I didn't mean to set myself up with one of my well-known impressions,\n\n18:02.080 --> 18:10.760\nall right, wait, okay, let me get out my phone, let's start bringing people up, oh, I want\n\n18:10.760 --> 18:19.880\nto, you know what, quick, listen to Duncan Trestle's podcast, I like to think that most\n\n18:19.880 --> 18:24.360\nof our audience is kind of overlapping, because I think if you like the meal you get here,\n\n18:24.360 --> 18:30.040\nit's pretty tasty over there as well, and vice versa, but I mean, right, if you haven't\n\n18:30.040 --> 18:36.000\njumped aboard, like, right now, I feel like, this is hyperbolic, I'm not like a big podcast\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:41.760\nguy, but I feel like he must be making podcast history, that this is something that, his\n\n18:41.760 --> 18:47.200\nmom is dying, he just recovered from testicular cancer, which is completely unrelated to him,\n\n18:47.200 --> 18:53.960\nthat his mom, his mom is succumbing to breast cancer, I believe, and, but it's like, it's\n\n18:53.960 --> 18:58.440\njust incredible, like, I had to pull my car over to the side of the road, when he was\n\n18:58.440 --> 19:04.240\njust talking about it, he's in, I think he's in North Carolina, you know, getting her affairs\n\n19:04.240 --> 19:07.800\nin order and talking to her and stuff, and then that was, it was already enough just\n\n19:07.800 --> 19:12.080\nhim talking about it, it was mind blowing, the way that this guy is able to cope with\n\n19:12.080 --> 19:17.480\nthe fundamental things that cause us suffering, and the big, giant cosmic elephants in the\n\n19:17.480 --> 19:21.920\ncosmic room, like, he's, it's not like he's a man, he's not Caesar Milaning them, but\n\n19:21.920 --> 19:26.640\nhe is able to, like, you're not supposed to, he knows that you're not supposed to, and\n\n19:26.640 --> 19:30.720\nhe's just like, I don't know, the Elan, with which he talks about the stuff, and then on\n\n19:30.720 --> 19:36.440\ntop of all that, just the most recently, now the most recent episode is, it's his mom,\n\n19:36.440 --> 19:41.520\nhe's interviewing his mom, literally on her deathbed, there is no skirting around it,\n\n19:41.520 --> 19:46.600\nthey're not, nor are they joking about it hilariously, it's not depressing, it's not,\n\n19:46.600 --> 19:51.480\nit's not fake uplifting, it's just honest and sincere and incredible, and, and there\n\n19:51.480 --> 19:56.040\nmust be some kind of, because this is how I process things, there must be some kind\n\n19:56.040 --> 20:02.080\nof potty award, oh you mean like podcast, not potty like you take a poop when you're\n\n20:02.080 --> 20:10.440\na baby, I want to reduce everything to, give him an award, that was great, that was a joke\n\n20:10.440 --> 20:15.080\nbut, I guess you guys can see that I'm that petty, you said potty, which makes it sound\n\n20:15.080 --> 20:18.440\nlike poopies, oh no, no, I don't think, no, they still, they still, no, they understand\n\n20:18.440 --> 20:22.600\nwhat I'm saying, they refuse to laugh at my joke, because of, they're like, Dan, a woman's\n\n20:22.600 --> 20:26.760\ndying, and I'm like, yeah, but I have a joke that I'm doing, and they're like, yeah, we\n\n20:26.760 --> 20:31.840\nget it, you're not entitled to a laugh from us, and I'm like, we visited a friend of ours\n\n20:31.840 --> 20:34.800\nthat was in a hospital for maybe trumped up reasons and nothing was wrong with them,\n\n20:34.800 --> 20:39.600\nbut you, you were very ill at ease in there, we were in their ER, oh, yeah, well, I don't\n\n20:39.600 --> 20:43.880\nlike hospitals for sure, yeah, I mean, nobody does, but you were, you looked really like,\n\n20:43.880 --> 20:49.640\nlike, really freaked out, well, I mean, here's the thing, I don't make a lot of eye contact\n\n20:49.640 --> 20:56.880\nin general, an emergency room is a three foot like closet, so if you're not making eye contact\n\n20:56.880 --> 21:01.240\nin an emergency room, it's like, you don't really have, it's kind of like, you can either\n\n21:01.240 --> 21:05.400\nstare at your friend in an emergency room bed, or you can do what you did, which is you showed\n\n21:05.400 --> 21:09.880\nup for five minutes, and then you went, I'm bored, and you left, which is fine, I also\n\n21:09.880 --> 21:13.360\nsaid, do you validate, which is how that hilarious, right, no, we all did lots of bits, and we\n\n21:13.360 --> 21:19.800\nhad a great time, like, nobody, I mean, I'm going to use that forever now, every time\n\n21:19.800 --> 21:23.320\nI go into somebody, I'm going to say, I'm going to leave, do you validate, this is hilarious,\n\n21:23.320 --> 21:26.080\nwe all took pictures and did bits about the environment and stuff, but yeah, I mean,\n\n21:26.080 --> 21:31.040\nit's like, like, sure, I'll own the fact that I don't, I don't like my friends in hospitals,\n\n21:31.040 --> 21:34.320\nand I don't like strangers in hospitals, I don't like hospitals, I guess this people\n\n21:34.320 --> 21:37.760\nlike get light-headed, this people that get sick to their stomach, I'm more of a stomach\n\n21:37.760 --> 21:43.160\nkind, I get a little queasy when I see people hurt, I thought he wasn't, he was fine, but\n\n21:43.160 --> 21:46.040\nlike, I've gone and visited friends that were like, you know, had been in car accidents\n\n21:46.040 --> 21:53.760\nand stuff, and I get really like, like I want to puke, alright, no, I, maybe I went, maybe\n\n21:53.760 --> 22:00.080\nI went to some sort of pukey award, he, he, he, he had, he had, you know what, let me\n\n22:00.080 --> 22:08.440\ndo what they didn't do, hahaha, you know, there's basic human rights people have as\n\n22:08.440 --> 22:12.320\nperformers, you know, if you, if you, if they go like this, for instance, when they bounce\n\n22:12.320 --> 22:15.640\non their toes like Johnny Carson at the end of something, you could give them a chuckle,\n\n22:15.640 --> 22:19.680\neven if they don't think it's funny, I didn't know whether to, whether to marry it or drive\n\n22:19.680 --> 22:26.280\nit, and then you kind of do that, thank you, was that so hard? Jesus Christ, it's not,\n\n22:26.280 --> 22:34.800\nI'm not running for office, I'm just doing a show, it's all, it's all a joke, I don't\n\n22:34.800 --> 22:41.640\nknow what I'm saying ever, but I do know what I'm watching, and sometimes what I'm\n\n22:41.640 --> 22:47.640\nwatching are horror movies, and last, last week, we, we, he wasn't here, but he's here\n\n22:47.640 --> 22:51.800\nthis week, and it's, he actually, it turns out he's, he's, he's currently in the process\n\n22:51.800 --> 22:56.240\nof retiring his horror movie a day blog, and we've, now it's more, actually more timely\n\n22:56.240 --> 23:01.680\nto bring him up, so God smiled upon us, uh, booking-wise, um, so, can we bring to the\n\n23:01.680 --> 23:11.680\nstage Brian W.

Yeah, we can sit down like this, and, um, so you're, you're a long time Armenian,\n\n23:28.160 --> 23:31.360\nI mean, you, as far as I know, you've been here since, since long before we even started\n\n23:31.360 --> 23:36.200\npodcasting, I, but I don't know, or care, but, uh, I mean, we've talked to you often,\n\n23:36.200 --> 23:40.440\nand, and, and know you as a, as a friend, and that you have this blog, which I have never\n\n23:40.440 --> 23:46.160\nvisited, but that I find endlessly fascinating, because, which is sure by our symptom of narcissism,\n\n23:46.160 --> 23:49.440\nlike, where you're like, oh, my friend does this really interesting thing, and I'm just\n\n23:49.440 --> 23:54.840\nlike, still though, I'm gonna read this Tumblr entry about myself one more time, and it's,\n\n23:54.840 --> 23:59.360\nand it's no wonder my brain is decaying, like, like, like, it's like, uh, eating, eating\n\n23:59.360 --> 24:04.520\nthe lead paint of my own ego, and like, like, like, like, of course I'm gonna die of something.\n\n24:04.520 --> 24:10.480\nUh, Brian, uh, tell us, tell us about your blog in a nutshell, and, and know that I'm\n\n24:10.480 --> 24:11.480\na bad interviewer.\n\n24:11.480 --> 24:17.480\nAll right, so, uh, yeah, um, just a little over six years ago, I started watching horror\n\n24:17.480 --> 24:22.800\nmovies every day, and a couple weeks into it, I just decided to start writing reviews\n\n24:22.800 --> 24:23.800\nas well.\n\n24:23.800 --> 24:24.800\nThat does it.\n\n24:24.800 --> 24:25.800\nThat does it.\n\n24:25.800 --> 24:26.800\nThank you.\n\n24:26.800 --> 24:27.800\nGood enough.\n\n24:27.800 --> 24:32.960\nUm, and, uh, you know, I, I, I started being like an editor, I never really wrote much,\n\n24:32.960 --> 24:36.560\num, so I was just kind of figuring out how to write reviews every day.\n\n24:36.560 --> 24:38.280\nYou watch a horror movie every day?\n\n24:38.280 --> 24:39.280\nEvery day.\n\n24:39.280 --> 24:40.280\nFor six years?\n\n24:40.280 --> 24:41.280\nYeah.\n\n24:41.280 --> 24:42.280\nSo what's six times 365?\n\n24:42.280 --> 24:43.280\nAnybody good at math?\n\n24:43.280 --> 24:44.280\nNo, 1800.\n\n24:44.280 --> 24:45.280\nIs that right?\n\n24:45.280 --> 24:50.560\nWell, I mean, there are days where I watch more, you know, I go to festivals, and there's\n\n24:50.560 --> 24:56.960\nlike four or something, so the 2,500 is the mark that I'm stopping at, which is, uh, March\n\n24:56.960 --> 24:57.960\n31st.\n\n24:57.960 --> 25:00.560\nSo the first question is, how does that start?\n\n25:00.560 --> 25:05.640\nLike, like, like, like, at one point you noticed, you realized you were on a streak of watching\n\n25:05.640 --> 25:06.640\none a day.\n\n25:06.640 --> 25:07.640\nOh yeah, no.\n\n25:07.640 --> 25:10.640\nUh, basically what happened was that I rented, you know, the discs from Netflix that all\n\n25:10.640 --> 25:15.240\nhappened to be horror, and, uh, they were sitting on my, like, my couch for four months,\n\n25:15.240 --> 25:18.080\nand I was like looking, I'm like, wait, I could have just bought these three movies\n\n25:18.080 --> 25:19.080\nby now.\n\n25:19.080 --> 25:20.080\nThere's a lot, there's 2007.\n\n25:20.080 --> 25:21.080\nThey didn't have Netflix.\n\n25:21.080 --> 25:22.080\nWait, what do you mean?\n\n25:22.080 --> 25:23.080\nYou bought them as opposed to what?\n\n25:23.080 --> 25:26.120\nAs opposed to paying for Netflix for three months for nothing, because this is before\n\n25:26.120 --> 25:27.760\ninstant, so it's just the discs.\n\n25:27.760 --> 25:28.760\nOh, oh, okay.\n\n25:28.760 --> 25:31.920\nWell, it's like, all right, four times, whatever, three, you know, Netflix thing, I'm like,\n\n25:31.920 --> 25:32.920\nI could have just bought these.\n\n25:32.920 --> 25:35.640\nUm, like, you know, and then I just started thinking about my day, I'm like, all right,\n\n25:35.640 --> 25:38.880\nyou sleep for eight hours, you eat, you work for eight hours, it's eight hours of the day,\n\n25:38.880 --> 25:41.520\nI'm doing something, well, I can't, I just watch a horror movie.\n\n25:41.520 --> 25:42.520\nRight.\n\n25:42.520 --> 25:43.520\nUm, and so it started.\n\n25:43.520 --> 25:48.240\nSo, and it, and it, now, were you single at the time when it, when it, no, actually,\n\n25:48.240 --> 25:52.280\nthe only time I ever missed a day was like a week after I started.\n\n25:52.280 --> 25:56.600\nUh, my wife and I took like a, uh, uh, it was our five year anniversary of dating, and\n\n25:56.600 --> 26:02.320\nwe went down to, uh, to Long Beach for like a four day weekend, and I missed one day then.\n\n26:02.320 --> 26:06.240\nYeah, the other three days, I still watch horror movies, but, so you've not missed,\n\n26:06.240 --> 26:08.520\nuh, you've only missed one day in six years.\n\n26:08.520 --> 26:09.520\nYeah.\n\n26:09.520 --> 26:10.520\nWow.\n\n26:10.520 --> 26:13.280\nAnd, uh, that's why I didn't come last week, because I was actually, I didn't watch the\n\n26:13.280 --> 26:14.280\nmovie yet.\n\n26:14.280 --> 26:15.280\nOh, really?\n\n26:15.280 --> 26:16.280\nYeah.\n\n26:16.280 --> 26:17.840\nSo, like, I got out of work and I was like, is it Martial Fear?\n\n26:17.840 --> 26:18.840\nDo you still enjoy it?\n\n26:18.840 --> 26:20.840\nYeah, no, it's, it's part of the day now.\n\n26:20.840 --> 26:25.400\nSo, I mean, I don't, it's not hard to like, I mean, every now and then things get busy,\n\n26:25.400 --> 26:28.840\nbut, uh, so we can assume you've seen Leprechaun on the hood.\n\n26:28.840 --> 26:31.400\nWell, let's talk about that in a second.\n\n26:31.400 --> 26:39.240\nUh, left on the hood, uh, up to no good, uh, up to do no good, uh, the, the, um, uh, so\n\n26:39.240 --> 26:41.840\nwhat, what, what do you think it is about the genre?\n\n26:41.840 --> 26:43.400\nIs it, is it like cheesecake?\n\n26:43.400 --> 26:46.440\nIs it like, like, like, like, like, is it a comfort food?\n\n26:46.440 --> 26:53.800\nLike the genre of horror, as opposed to sci-fi fantasy, as opposed to, uh, Tom Cruise thriller?\n\n26:53.800 --> 26:57.880\nIs it, is it, is it, what, what is, is there a factory must have thought about this sometime\n\n26:57.880 --> 26:58.880\nin six years?\n\n26:58.880 --> 26:59.880\nWell, Tom Cruise thriller day sucked.\n\n26:59.880 --> 27:06.480\nI mean, I'll ask you, um, no, uh, no, I've left horror since I was a little kid, um,\n\n27:06.480 --> 27:08.600\nyou know, it wasn't like I just started watching horror that day.\n\n27:08.600 --> 27:11.520\nLike, you know, I've obviously been into it since I was like six or seven.\n\n27:11.520 --> 27:13.560\nSo, why, why do we like horror movies?\n\n27:13.560 --> 27:18.440\nUh, I think for me, I just found them, the more creative, because, you know, I always\n\n27:18.440 --> 27:22.920\nhad friends that were into like doing special effects, makeup, um, and, you know, editing\n\n27:22.920 --> 27:24.120\nand stuff like that.\n\n27:24.120 --> 27:28.160\nSo to me, like, you can really get away with more when you're doing horror, as opposed\n\n27:28.160 --> 27:31.280\nto like, like romantic comedies, where you kind of have to fit that formula.\n\n27:31.280 --> 27:32.280\nRight.\n\n27:32.280 --> 27:33.280\nDid they scare you?\n\n27:33.280 --> 27:34.280\nAre there any that?\n\n27:34.280 --> 27:35.280\nNot since I was a kid, no.\n\n27:35.280 --> 27:36.280\nVery rarely.\n\n27:36.280 --> 27:37.780\nThere's not one that still gets you, gives you nightmares or anything like that?\n\n27:37.780 --> 27:42.280\nNo, I mean, those, I watched, uh, I rewatched, like, two years ago, this TV movie that I\n\n27:42.280 --> 27:44.000\nsaw when I was a kid called Don't Go to Sleep.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:45.000\nDoes anybody know that one?\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:46.000\nDon't know.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:47.000\nDon't go to sleep.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:50.160\nIt was a TV horror, the back of like, when they did made for TV movies every week.\n\n27:50.160 --> 27:54.600\nUh, it's about a little girl that gets possessed by the spirit of her older sister who had\n\n27:54.600 --> 27:56.160\ndied in a car accident.\n\n27:56.160 --> 28:00.120\nAnd she blames the family, so she systematically wipes out the family.\n\n28:00.120 --> 28:03.600\nAnd there's this bit where, like, she's possessed and she has a pizza cutter and she's just\n\n28:03.600 --> 28:07.040\nlike going up the stairs of this pizza cutter and like, she goes upstairs and kills her\n\n28:07.040 --> 28:08.040\ndad with it.\n\n28:08.040 --> 28:09.040\nAnd like, that freaked the shit out.\n\n28:09.040 --> 28:10.040\nI mean, I was like six or seven.\n\n28:10.040 --> 28:11.040\nThere's always some image.\n\n28:11.040 --> 28:12.040\nYeah.\n\n28:12.040 --> 28:13.520\nYou're now afraid of pizza cutters.\n\n28:13.520 --> 28:14.520\nOh yeah.\n\n28:14.520 --> 28:17.640\nLike, if I open the kitchen drawer, I see when I get scared.\n\n28:17.640 --> 28:21.280\nYou would bring up romantic comedies as the obvious antithesis to the horror, which I\n\n28:21.280 --> 28:27.160\nthink is accurate because sex, which is the ultimate creative act, you're procreating,\n\n28:27.160 --> 28:31.080\nyou're creating life and death, which is, you know, I don't know if I finished this\n\n28:31.080 --> 28:32.080\nthought.\n\n28:32.080 --> 28:35.560\nLike, this is the battery that charges human life.\n\n28:35.560 --> 28:39.680\nLike, we're avoiding, we're afraid, we're all going to die, we know that we're going\n\n28:39.680 --> 28:44.520\nto die and we're also like driven to like make a life and live life.\n\n28:44.520 --> 28:49.720\nAnd so, and there probably is an equal volume of, actually, I bet horrors got it, got it,\n\n28:49.720 --> 28:54.880\ngot it, like doubled or tripled, but, but like, you could watch a rom-com a day.\n\n28:54.880 --> 28:55.880\nYou could try.\n\n28:55.880 --> 28:58.800\nLike, and you wouldn't necessarily end up having to loop back on yourself.\n\n28:58.800 --> 29:01.760\nI think they might make one a day.\n\n29:01.760 --> 29:06.240\nThe big question is, why isn't that like a visceral like thing?\n\n29:06.240 --> 29:11.320\nAnd I think the answer has to do with the honesty level of a society that's like high\n\n29:11.320 --> 29:12.320\non the hog.\n\n29:12.320 --> 29:18.000\nI think that, I think in a post Spielbergian box office world, you're, you, you're just\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:21.480\nnot allowed to be as creative with love as you are with death.\n\n29:21.480 --> 29:27.400\nI think that we have decided that death, because we elude it daily and, and have kind of compartmentalized\n\n29:27.400 --> 29:31.240\nit, we can actually, you can put, have Clint Howard in your movie and, and, and have him\n\n29:31.240 --> 29:34.640\nstab someone in the head with an ice cream cone and, you know, like, like, and go, and\n\n29:34.640 --> 29:36.640\ngo like, ah, what a fun way to kill that person.\n\n29:36.640 --> 29:41.040\nAnd here's a new way to make brains look real and, and we're constantly experimenting\n\n29:41.040 --> 29:45.080\nwith death and encouraged to do so because we've cartoonified death because we don't\n\n29:45.080 --> 29:50.560\nactually, we've turned funeral parlors into, you know, the parlors of our homes into, into\n\n29:50.560 --> 29:56.080\nliving rooms and, and, and, and, and put funeral parlors down the street and like made dead\n\n29:56.080 --> 29:58.960\nbodies, things that you bear, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, ranting about that.\n\n29:58.960 --> 30:02.200\nBut we've, we've compartmentalized death in Western society.\n\n30:02.200 --> 30:04.400\nAnd so like movies are like, hey, fun.\n\n30:04.400 --> 30:07.760\nIt's like, well, imagine if there's guts for flying out.\n\n30:07.760 --> 30:10.440\nRomance, however, is like, it's on these rails.\n\n30:10.440 --> 30:15.400\nIt's like, like, like, okay, like, this guy's a bad guy because he's, you know, you can't,\n\n30:15.400 --> 30:19.640\nyou can't do a million fun creative things with your dick and a vagina.\n\n30:19.640 --> 30:20.640\nThat's pornography.\n\n30:20.640 --> 30:26.440\nLike, like, that's not, it's, it's, it's, it's like, horror is still, it's not considered\n\n30:26.440 --> 30:34.640\npornography, but it's like, it's equally voluminous and also dealing with the primary colors\n\n30:34.640 --> 30:36.680\nof, of, of, of what we deal with.\n\n30:36.680 --> 30:41.240\nLike we're all scared of monsters and dying and stuff.\n\n30:41.240 --> 30:42.240\nThank you.\n\n30:42.240 --> 30:43.240\nI win.\n\n30:43.240 --> 30:48.200\nI win the contest with myself to see if I can explain why horror movies are good.\n\n30:48.200 --> 30:49.200\nAnd they're not good.\n\n30:49.200 --> 30:50.800\nThat's the other thing I wanted to ask you.\n\n30:50.800 --> 30:55.680\nYou must know more than anyone how many of them are bad because for the reasons I'm describing,\n\n30:55.680 --> 31:00.800\nany, like a lot, like it actually, like more hacks are probably attracted to the bug lamp\n\n31:00.800 --> 31:02.600\nthat is the horror genre.\n\n31:02.600 --> 31:06.800\nWell, that's, I mean, that's the thing is that, you know, unfortunately, not only are\n\n31:06.800 --> 31:10.520\nthere a lot of bad movies, there are, you know, no offense to bad fans and that they're\n\n31:10.520 --> 31:14.280\nlike, you know, you guys were talking about last week, the guys that like think shark\n\n31:14.280 --> 31:17.000\nto push and these sci-fi movies, they're funny.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:20.320\nSo you can make pretty much anything and not only will people watch it, but it's easy\n\n31:20.320 --> 31:25.160\nto sell because, you know, most horror movies are independent and it's like, oh, you killed\n\n31:25.160 --> 31:26.160\nthree people in it.\n\n31:26.160 --> 31:27.160\nCool.\n\n31:27.160 --> 31:30.680\nWe can put that on the cover and, you know, sell it in Germany and sell it over here.\n\n31:30.680 --> 31:34.400\nYou know, romantic comedies, all these other things, you know, that they're more star driven.\n\n31:34.400 --> 31:38.880\nYou can't like make like a low budget rom-com and instantly get that sale when you go to\n\n31:38.880 --> 31:40.440\nlike one of these film markets.\n\n31:40.440 --> 31:43.400\nSo yeah, I'll never run out of horror movies if I wasn't quitting because there's always\n\n31:43.400 --> 31:47.840\ngoing to be hacks that are like, $10,000, look at that, they do paranormal activity.\n\n31:47.840 --> 31:49.840\nYou know, we have a video camera and a house, we can do that, too.\n\n31:49.840 --> 31:54.160\nAnd so you have to sit and watch like the most horrible ones of all, which you can browse\n\n31:54.160 --> 31:57.840\nthrough on Apple TV and thank God for the preview feature where you can see from the\n\n31:57.840 --> 32:03.000\ntrailer like, oh, Jesus, they didn't even mix their sound, like it's just like flies\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:04.000\non a tree.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.920\nWhen you're done with this, when you watch 2,500, are you going to be happy to not have\n\n32:06.920 --> 32:07.920\nto watch these anymore?\n\n32:07.920 --> 32:09.400\nAre you still going to continue to watch horror films?\n\n32:09.400 --> 32:10.720\nNo, I mean, I'll still do stuff.\n\n32:10.720 --> 32:14.760\nYou know, I work for a couple of different websites now and like, I actually might be\n\n32:14.760 --> 32:18.800\nworking for Netflix as like a horror expert of some sort.\n\n32:18.800 --> 32:21.000\nIf anybody is, it's going to be you now, holy fuck.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.560\nSo, you know, so I'll still be watching.\n\n32:23.560 --> 32:27.000\nIt's just like, and the site will still be there, too, and I'll update it when I feel\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:30.160\nlike it, but I just won't like wake up and be like, all right, I got to find time to\n\n32:30.160 --> 32:34.320\nwatch like some children of the coin sequel or something, like, you know, or if I start\n\n32:34.320 --> 32:38.000\nwatching a movie and it's terrible, I'll be like a normal human being like you guys and\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:39.680\nshut it the fuck off.\n\n32:39.680 --> 32:43.280\nNow, what's your stance on the leprechaun of franchise?\n\n32:43.280 --> 32:45.680\nI like the first one when I was 13.\n\n32:45.680 --> 32:46.680\nRight.\n\n32:46.680 --> 32:47.680\nI think I watched one other.\n\n32:47.680 --> 32:49.560\nI've watched one of the, he's gone to the hood twice.\n\n32:49.560 --> 32:50.560\nYeah.\n\n32:50.560 --> 32:56.200\nWell, that's, it's an interesting thing to look at in terms of sequelogy, like if there's\n\n32:56.200 --> 33:01.800\na term paper you could write because let everyone kind of widely will say as a knee-jerk response\n\n33:01.800 --> 33:07.080\nif you bring up the leprechaun franchise that leprechaun, I think it was three in the hood\n\n33:07.080 --> 33:08.080\ninto hood.\n\n33:08.080 --> 33:09.080\nNo, no.\n\n33:09.080 --> 33:11.680\nSo three was Vegas, I think, or two.\n\n33:11.680 --> 33:13.960\nFour was in space and then five and six were the hood.\n\n33:13.960 --> 33:14.960\nOh, five.\n\n33:14.960 --> 33:15.960\nOh, really?\n\n33:15.960 --> 33:16.960\nYeah.\n\n33:16.960 --> 33:17.960\nWait, the two hoods were in the row?\n\n33:17.960 --> 33:18.960\nYeah.\n\n33:18.960 --> 33:19.960\nAre you sure about that?\n\n33:19.960 --> 33:20.960\nYeah.\n\n33:20.960 --> 33:21.960\nOkay, okay.\n\n33:21.960 --> 33:22.960\nHe goes, and it's not as interesting as I thought.\n\n33:22.960 --> 33:23.960\nHe goes to space?\n\n33:23.960 --> 33:24.960\nYeah, holy, he went to space.\n\n33:24.960 --> 33:25.960\nHe went to space.\n\n33:25.960 --> 33:26.960\nHe goes to the hood twice.\n\n33:26.960 --> 33:29.240\nBut it was, it was better when he was in the hood.\n\n33:29.240 --> 33:33.360\nThe reason why it was better when it was in the hood, you could tell watching the first\n\n33:33.360 --> 33:38.360\none like, like, like that it was like, it felt like it was written by white screenwriters.\n\n33:38.360 --> 33:41.600\nI don't know if any of this is true, like, if everyone correct me, this is what it felt\n\n33:41.600 --> 33:42.600\nlike.\n\n33:42.600 --> 33:43.600\nI'm not, I'm not a journalist here.\n\n33:43.600 --> 33:47.480\nIt felt, I kept picturing like two white screenwriters going like, you know, let's\n\n33:47.480 --> 33:54.440\nwrite a movie for the black people that wanna, like, let's put the people in the theater\n\n33:54.440 --> 33:58.480\nthat are always yelling that crazy stuff, let's put them in the movie and have them\n\n33:58.480 --> 34:01.480\nyell the stuff at the leprechaun.\n\n34:01.480 --> 34:05.800\nThat's what it felt like they were, it was sort of like this weird, like, like half love,\n\n34:05.800 --> 34:10.320\nhalf hate, like half a racist, half like, like, like, like cultural, like, emboldening\n\n34:10.320 --> 34:11.320\nthing.\n\n34:11.320 --> 34:13.080\nIt was, it was, that's what it felt like.\n\n34:13.080 --> 34:17.080\nI hope to hear it was written by a wonderful black screenwriter who was, who was just working\n\n34:17.080 --> 34:23.760\norganically and not from a weird entomology perspective by some guy going, what would\n\n34:23.760 --> 34:24.760\nthey like here?\n\n34:24.760 --> 34:29.320\nI think Ice-T should say what we're all thinking when we see the leprechaun as black America,\n\n34:29.320 --> 34:34.880\nwhich is, you ugly motherfucker, and then pop a cap in them, try to pop a cap in them, show\n\n34:34.880 --> 34:39.560\nthem that the cap popping doesn't work, show them why, they wanna know.\n\n34:39.560 --> 34:44.920\nWe asked them after the first two movies, like, why wouldn't they pop a cap?\n\n34:44.920 --> 34:48.120\nYou know, and, and let's show them, let's show them pop a cap and then have the caps\n\n34:48.120 --> 34:51.600\npop right back out, and then now you're invested.\n\n34:51.600 --> 34:56.280\nBut I kind of, I kind of agree with that philosophy, I'm giving, I'm giving them a weird, like,\n\n34:56.280 --> 35:00.800\nlike nasal dialect, but, but that might be me, that might be how I would approach writing\n\n35:00.800 --> 35:01.800\na leprechaun movie.\n\n35:01.800 --> 35:06.600\nAnyways, here's, here's my observation that I would like to make about the leprechaun\n\n35:06.600 --> 35:07.600\nfranchise.\n\n35:07.600 --> 35:13.760\nHere's the thing, we watched, like, three of them for St. Patrick's Day, leprechaun,\n\n35:13.760 --> 35:19.720\nthat's his name, definitely, like, watch these movies again, and like, watch a man, like,\n\n35:19.720 --> 35:27.440\nlike, like, he's, he, he, very, very many times, under a variety of circumstances, ends\n\n35:27.440 --> 35:35.960\nup pretending to be a woman, to get a man horny, and then killing him, like, like, right\n\n35:35.960 --> 35:38.920\nas the guy is, like, about to climax.\n\n35:38.920 --> 35:42.920\nHe never does the other thing, he never, like, if he wants, if he wants to just kill someone,\n\n35:42.920 --> 35:46.960\nhe can just rip their finger off, or like, he'll just go like, let me give you a leg\n\n35:46.960 --> 35:50.000\nup, and then it'll just rip your leg off.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:54.400\nSo it's like, weird that he sometimes then will crouch behind a crate or a bed, and he'll\n\n35:54.400 --> 35:59.880\njust, like, a guy will be taking out the mail, and then, and then a woman will go, hey, Carl,\n\n35:59.880 --> 36:03.880\ncome here, and it'll just be this sexy lady, and then they'll just keep cutting to the\n\n36:03.880 --> 36:08.880\nleprechaun behind the crate, going like, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, and he does it over and over\n\n36:08.880 --> 36:13.160\nand over again, and it keeps, I think it kind of escalates, like, I feel like the leprechaun\n\n36:13.160 --> 36:19.720\nseries is about, on another level, it's about a bi-curious kind of mythical creature, like,\n\n36:19.720 --> 36:24.880\nit feels like he's getting more and more either honest or dishonest, I can't tell, because\n\n36:24.880 --> 36:28.000\none of them's about him, he wants to marry this woman, but then he keeps on, he's like,\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:32.640\noh, I've got, I've got you here, oh, my bride, oh, but he never does anything with her, and\n\n36:32.640 --> 36:37.320\nthen he keeps making excuses to go out and just pose as more women and have fake, fake\n\n36:37.320 --> 36:41.240\nleprechaun sex with men, you know, I don't know, watch it, tell me what you think.\n\n36:41.240 --> 36:45.320\nYou just put more thought into the leprechaun sequels than any other, including the people\n\n36:45.320 --> 36:46.320\nthat made them.\n\n36:46.320 --> 36:51.360\nAnd just, well, that may be true, but mythology has a life of its own, and I feel the story\n\n36:51.360 --> 36:56.080\nbeing told with the leprechaun character, he's like Ulysses, you know, he's his own character,\n\n36:56.080 --> 37:00.400\nand I think that his character exists in a maelstrom of sexual feelings, you know, I\n\n37:00.400 --> 37:06.040\nfeel like he's like popping out of the, in modern America, and he's going like, oh,\n\n37:06.040 --> 37:13.000\nit seems like the standards are a bit different now, what was once a little weird to go to\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:20.320\nas a place like it's now a little more, okay, I could have a lot of fun around here, and\n\n37:20.320 --> 37:24.240\nhe's sort of like, you're watching him like kind of push his boundaries, his own personal\n\n37:24.240 --> 37:29.920\nboundaries, like he's getting over his own catexes, like there's no, there's no sign\n\n37:29.920 --> 37:34.320\nin the wall that says, don't be gay, like, like he's, that's in his head, but he's kind\n\n37:34.320 --> 37:39.080\nof like pushing it and pushing it, like, and he gets increasingly like more sexually amorphous\n\n37:39.080 --> 37:42.880\nas the series continues, so I think if they make another leprechaun movie, they should\n\n37:42.880 --> 37:46.280\njust have him like naked, like, like, and just kind of like, like, they're making another\n\n37:46.280 --> 37:49.440\none, it comes out this month, okay, thank you, Adam Goldberg says they're making another\n\n37:49.440 --> 37:53.800\none, it comes out this month, I hope it's called like leprechaun, the gloves are off,\n\n37:53.800 --> 37:59.240\nand by gloves we mean sexual hang-ups, you know, and have him just, maybe it's not a\n\n37:59.240 --> 38:05.440\nhorror movie, maybe it's just about, you know, like him doing his thing, like, like, why\n\n38:05.440 --> 38:10.120\nhave to end it with a guy's face getting cut off, you know, if clearly, if you look\n\n38:10.120 --> 38:15.160\nat the amount of time that's spent in each leprechaun movie, percentage-wise, it's really\n\n38:15.160 --> 38:18.680\nthe more important theme in these movies is bisexuality.\n\n38:18.680 --> 38:24.520\nThey keep up, I didn't watch all the, you know, all the secrets, do they keep up with\n\n38:24.520 --> 38:25.520\nit?\n\n38:25.520 --> 38:28.040\nI really remember the first one anymore, it was like they stopped him by throwing shoes\n\n38:28.040 --> 38:30.400\nat him, because he had a thing where he had to clean shoes.\n\n38:30.400 --> 38:36.400\nYeah, that's the original, you watched over 2,000 movies now, and you didn't get through\n\n38:36.400 --> 38:37.400\nmore than one leprechaun?\n\n38:37.400 --> 38:42.400\nThat's the thing, that's not bad ones that I know, like, I know the leprechauns, like,\n\n38:42.400 --> 38:45.560\nespecially the ones that, I mean, the first one actually played theatrically, and then\n\n38:45.560 --> 38:46.560\nit's not good news.\n\n38:46.560 --> 38:54.640\nWith a child, like, like, if I can make a recommendation, I don't know how easy this\n\n38:54.640 --> 38:59.480\nis to do with Netflix's or Hulu's or whatever, but at some point in my life, a friend of\n\n38:59.480 --> 39:06.760\nmine got his hands on a copy of Child's Play, it was a Mexican, or the Spanish dub, the\n\n39:06.760 --> 39:12.560\nSpanish dub of Child's Play, and it is hilarious, it's the best fucking thing if you want to\n\n39:12.560 --> 39:18.880\nhave a good time with your friends, get Spanish Child's Play, because they give him this kind\n\n39:18.880 --> 39:28.320\nof Speedy Gonzalez voice, and it's really, it's really, he's just this little Spanish\n\n39:28.320 --> 39:33.920\nguy running around, and it's good, also E.T., E.T. in Spanish is hilarious, because he really\n\n39:33.920 --> 39:44.000\nis, he just sounds like an immigrant, like an illegal alien, and it's like, and it takes\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:47.000\non a different meaning.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:53.480\nSo different, not horror, break into, is that Electric Boogaloo?\n\n39:53.480 --> 39:59.200\nRent that movie, is that the one with turbo in it, or is that, turbo, any time turbo is\n\n39:59.200 --> 40:03.000\non, freeze frame, because he's making the funniest face in the world.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:09.320\nI just sent it out there, put it on, like, go to like, send images to me, any time turbo\n\n40:09.320 --> 40:14.080\nis on the camera, hit pause, funny as shit you'll ever see in your life, get high and\n\n40:14.080 --> 40:16.880\nwatch break into and hit the pause.\n\n40:16.880 --> 40:20.520\nWe should have like, Oprah's Book Club, we could have like a, we could have a science,\n\n40:20.520 --> 40:24.560\nlike, let's all watch before we reconvene, let's all watch, we'll pick one movie that\n\n40:24.560 --> 40:25.720\nwe can watch this week.\n\n40:25.720 --> 40:26.720\nLet's all watch Heart Target.\n\n40:26.720 --> 40:27.720\nAnd we can all talk about it.\n\n40:27.720 --> 40:28.720\nI'll talk about Wofford Brimley afterwards.\n\n40:28.720 --> 40:33.400\nMaybe we'll pick one by the end of the show and experiment with that concept.\n\n40:33.400 --> 40:35.400\nSo it's called horrormovieaday.com.\n\n40:35.400 --> 40:40.280\nHorrormovieaday.com, or, yeah, it's on Blogspot, but yeah.\n\n40:40.280 --> 40:43.360\nIt's on Blogspot, I mean, I don't know how you guys feel about that.\n\n40:43.360 --> 40:47.560\nWell, it's got this long, because it's Blogspot, you know, it's a URL, so it's like a whole\n\n40:47.560 --> 40:51.560\nbunch of terrible, you know, dashes and stuff, so just horrormovieaday.com.\n\n40:51.560 --> 40:52.560\nIt'll redirect you.\n\n40:52.560 --> 40:53.560\nYeah, yeah.\n\n40:53.560 --> 40:59.280\nIt'll, it'll, it'll slash through your URL and, and murder it.\n\n40:59.280 --> 41:00.280\nHorrormovieaday.com.\n\n41:00.280 --> 41:15.080\nThank, thank you, Brian W. Collins, for visiting us on the eve of your, thank you, Brian.\n\n41:15.080 --> 41:17.080\nHe seems like an okay guy.\n\n41:17.080 --> 41:20.680\nHe seems like, I've lost my mind watching that many horrormovies.\n\n41:20.680 --> 41:25.520\nI like, I like, I like, I like random, like, like, yeah, like, I need something like that.\n\n41:25.520 --> 41:30.440\nI need some kind of thing to come into my life where I'm like, I'm, I have a thing,\n\n41:30.440 --> 41:34.400\nyou know, where you go like, okay, I'm going to do this thing now.\n\n41:34.400 --> 41:35.400\nIt's called Minecraft.\n\n41:35.400 --> 41:39.800\nWell, no, I think that's, that's just, you know, like, that's, that's not, if I were\n\n41:39.800 --> 41:43.760\nto say, I'm going to play two hours of Minecraft every day or something, you could turn something\n\n41:43.760 --> 41:48.080\nunhealthy into something healthy, which is structure, you know, but that's not going\n\n41:48.080 --> 41:49.080\nto be it.\n\n41:49.080 --> 41:50.080\nThat's dumb.\n\n41:50.080 --> 41:51.080\nThat's a dumb idea.\n\n41:51.080 --> 41:52.080\nYou just pitched.\n\n41:52.080 --> 41:53.080\nIt's a dumb idea.\n\n41:53.080 --> 41:56.320\nIt's something like, I'm going to, I'm going to do stained glass in my basement.\n\n41:56.320 --> 42:00.800\nI'm going to make a stained glass duck and I'm going to make a, I'm going to make my\n\n42:00.800 --> 42:01.800\nown BB gun.\n\n42:01.800 --> 42:07.640\nI'm going to make a BB gun and it's going to fire a real BB.\n\n42:07.640 --> 42:11.200\nI'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, uh, uh, uh, uh.\n\n42:11.200 --> 42:12.840\nDon't you owe Fox a script right now?\n\n42:12.840 --> 42:13.840\nYeah.\n\n42:13.840 --> 42:18.160\nI'm going to write that, but then like, you know, like, then I'm going to.\n\n42:18.160 --> 42:21.840\nIf I'm a Fox exec and I'm hearing this podcast next week and you're talking about making\n\n42:21.840 --> 42:24.560\nBB guns, I'm like, where's my sitcom?\n\n42:24.560 --> 42:25.560\nYeah.\n\n42:25.560 --> 42:26.560\nI think they've moved on.\n\n42:26.560 --> 42:31.120\nI think if they're smart, but I'm saying I need a hobby, you know, at a certain point\n\n42:31.120 --> 42:33.400\nas soon as I finish my job, I need a hobby.\n\n42:33.400 --> 42:37.240\nUh, uh, let's keep the train rolling and bring, and bring, and bring, and bring, let's get\n\n42:37.240 --> 42:38.240\nSpencer up here.\n\n42:38.240 --> 42:39.240\nHuh?\n\n42:39.240 --> 42:40.240\nAll right.\n\n42:40.240 --> 42:50.560\nBecause, uh, we also watched Space Jam last night.\n\n42:50.560 --> 42:51.560\nYeah.\n\n42:51.560 --> 42:52.560\nYeah.\n\n42:52.560 --> 42:53.560\nI got drunk and went home.\n\n42:53.560 --> 42:54.560\nI missed that one.\n\n42:54.560 --> 42:55.560\nHello, Spencer.\n\n42:55.560 --> 42:56.560\nHow are you, man?\n\n42:56.560 --> 42:57.560\nI'm, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm good.\n\n42:57.560 --> 42:58.560\nI'm good.\n\n42:58.560 --> 43:00.680\nHey, that was a measured response.\n\n43:00.680 --> 43:02.080\nDid you stay for all of Space Jam?\n\n43:02.080 --> 43:03.440\nNo, I left pretty early.\n\n43:03.440 --> 43:06.520\nI mean, I've seen that movie, but I used to watch it a lot.\n\n43:06.520 --> 43:10.560\nI had, um, you know, what were those, the Martian guys called?\n\n43:10.560 --> 43:11.560\nThe Monsters.\n\n43:11.560 --> 43:12.560\nMonsters.\n\n43:12.560 --> 43:16.120\nNo, before that, they had it like a dumb name that wasn't a team.\n\n43:16.120 --> 43:19.440\nIt was like something Ling, I think, I don't know, whatever.\n\n43:19.440 --> 43:22.320\nI had stuffed animal versions of all the puny little versions.\n\n43:22.320 --> 43:23.560\nIt was pretty awesome.\n\n43:23.560 --> 43:27.880\nAnd I had like a favorite, you know, but they were all really like cut and paste before\n\n43:27.880 --> 43:29.560\nthey got like superpowers.\n\n43:29.560 --> 43:30.560\nSo yeah.\n\n43:30.560 --> 43:31.560\nI don't know.\n\n43:31.560 --> 43:32.560\nSo they were just different colors.\n\n43:32.560 --> 43:33.560\nI was like the red one.\n\n43:33.560 --> 43:34.560\nSpace Jam, like the Bugs Bunny.\n\n43:34.560 --> 43:35.560\nYeah.\n\n43:35.560 --> 43:36.560\nYeah.\n\n43:36.560 --> 43:37.560\nMichael Jordan.\n\n43:37.560 --> 43:38.560\nBill Murray.\n\n43:38.560 --> 43:39.560\nAnd Newman.\n\n43:39.560 --> 43:40.560\nYeah.\n\n43:40.560 --> 43:43.560\nI imagine Space Jam might be some people's Xanadu in this room, you know, given the age.\n\n43:43.560 --> 43:45.160\nDoes anybody here love Space Jam?\n\n43:45.160 --> 43:46.160\nYeah.\n\n43:46.160 --> 43:47.160\nMy applause.\n\n43:47.160 --> 43:48.160\nDon't raise your hands.\n\n43:48.160 --> 43:49.160\nPark up.\n\n43:49.160 --> 43:53.160\nI just played it knowing that it's terrible and non-ironically, or is it an ironic level?\n\n43:53.160 --> 43:55.160\nI grew up in Chicago in the 90s.\n\n43:55.160 --> 43:57.160\nMichael Jordan was like a god.\n\n43:57.160 --> 43:58.160\nI thought it was the greatest movie ever made.\n\n43:58.160 --> 44:00.160\nSo you love it because Michael Jordan is a protagonist in it?\n\n44:00.160 --> 44:02.160\nOr is he like a guest star in it?\n\n44:02.160 --> 44:03.160\nOr is he a visitant?\n\n44:03.160 --> 44:04.160\nNo.\n\n44:04.160 --> 44:05.160\nHe's a guest star.\n\n44:05.160 --> 44:07.160\nIt's a buddy comedy with him and, you know, Bugs Bunny.\n\n44:07.160 --> 44:08.160\nSpace Jam.\n\n44:08.160 --> 44:09.160\nYeah.\n\n44:09.160 --> 44:10.160\nWait.\n\n44:10.160 --> 44:13.160\nAll I remember is Marvin Martians in it, right?\n\n44:13.160 --> 44:15.160\nIsn't he out there like a...\n\n44:15.160 --> 44:16.160\nYeah.\n\n44:16.160 --> 44:17.160\nYeah.\n\n44:17.160 --> 44:19.160\nAnd they play basketball.\n\n44:19.160 --> 44:21.160\nIf I were to...\n\n44:21.160 --> 44:29.160\nI tried to run through today the narrative, like, kind of cascade of, like, why are ending\n\n44:29.160 --> 44:32.160\nwith the answer to why are they playing basketball?\n\n44:32.160 --> 44:33.160\nWhy?\n\n44:33.160 --> 44:34.160\nWhat are the stakes?\n\n44:34.160 --> 44:41.160\nIt starts five iterations up, like, on a planet that is both animated but not Looney Tune\n\n44:41.160 --> 44:42.160\nplanet.\n\n44:42.160 --> 44:45.160\nIt's a planet of animated monsters that need amusement.\n\n44:45.160 --> 44:47.160\nThey're in an amusement shortage.\n\n44:47.160 --> 44:52.160\nAnd the boss of that planet says, I want the Looney Tunes to work for us.\n\n44:52.160 --> 44:55.160\nAnd he sends his henchmen out and the henchmen go and they make the...\n\n44:55.160 --> 44:57.160\nThey tell the Looney Tunes, you have to work for us.\n\n44:57.160 --> 45:02.160\nAnd the Looney Tunes go, you know, they use Bugs Bunny Clever Power to go, hey, we have\n\n45:02.160 --> 45:03.160\nto...\n\n45:03.160 --> 45:06.160\nWe get a chance to fight back before you indenture us into servitude.\n\n45:06.160 --> 45:11.160\nAnd instead of just saying, you're not allowed to do this, Bugs Bunny says, you have to\n\n45:11.160 --> 45:15.160\ngive us a right chance to fight back, and they go, okay, how?\n\n45:15.160 --> 45:20.160\nAnd they go, okay, they're really small, so let's play basketball.\n\n45:20.160 --> 45:26.160\nSo then because they say basketball, the monster aliens steal the talent from Charles Barclay\n\n45:26.160 --> 45:30.160\nand Lil Pennier, whoever was in a Nike commercial back then.\n\n45:30.160 --> 45:34.160\nAnd they all grow big because that means they're talented.\n\n45:34.160 --> 45:42.160\nAnd because they do that, then the Looney Tunes go and abduct Michael Jordan from a golf course.\n\n45:42.160 --> 45:46.160\nMeanwhile, there's a B story to the movie which details Michael Jordan's emotional journey\n\n45:46.160 --> 45:53.160\nfrom going from basketball player to baseball player to golf hobbyist and friend of Bill Murray.\n\n45:53.160 --> 46:02.160\nBill Murray, meanwhile, walks into and out of the movie of his own free will anytime he wants.\n\n46:02.160 --> 46:09.160\nJust like in the middle of his own scenes, he'll just go, yeah, well, that's what I'm trying to...\n\n46:09.160 --> 46:12.160\nAnd he'll just disappear from coverage.\n\n46:12.160 --> 46:13.160\nWhere'd Bill Murray go?\n\n46:13.160 --> 46:14.160\nWasn't he there a second ago?\n\n46:14.160 --> 46:15.160\nYeah, I guess he got tired.\n\n46:15.160 --> 46:17.160\nIt's like in Tootsie.\n\n46:17.160 --> 46:18.160\nHe's there, he's gone.\n\n46:18.160 --> 46:20.160\nYeah, he's just bad.\n\n46:20.160 --> 46:25.160\nSo there's another character played by the fat guy from Jurassic Park who I...\n\n46:25.160 --> 46:28.160\nMy writer's eye tells me it's the same character.\n\n46:28.160 --> 46:29.160\nYeah, Wayne Knight.\n\n46:29.160 --> 46:33.160\nIt's the same character, but for all the scenes Bill Murray couldn't do.\n\n46:33.160 --> 46:34.160\nNo.\n\n46:34.160 --> 46:35.160\nWayne Knight is kind of...\n\n46:35.160 --> 46:36.160\nThere's another character.\n\n46:36.160 --> 46:38.160\nHe's Michael Jordan's agent or something.\n\n46:38.160 --> 46:45.160\nBut anyways, like I said, if I were to start trying to explain Space Jam to you, we'd be here until like 9 p.m.\n\n46:45.160 --> 46:47.160\nBut there are people who love the movie.\n\n46:47.160 --> 46:51.160\nOn its own merits or simply because you were from Chicago and Michael Jordan lived there?\n\n46:51.160 --> 46:53.160\nIt was great.\n\n46:53.160 --> 46:54.160\nCome up on stage.\n\n46:54.160 --> 46:55.160\nCan we get you on stage?\n\n46:55.160 --> 46:56.160\nWhat's your name?\n\n46:56.160 --> 46:57.160\nWhat's your name?\n\n46:57.160 --> 46:58.160\nShannon.\n\n46:58.160 --> 46:59.160\nShannon.\n\n46:59.160 --> 47:00.160\nShannon.\n\n47:00.160 --> 47:01.160\nShannon.\n\n47:01.160 --> 47:02.160\nSpace Jam apologist.\n\n47:02.160 --> 47:03.160\nHi.\n\n47:03.160 --> 47:07.160\nI mean, I love being right about stuff, so let me try to...\n\n47:07.160 --> 47:10.160\nI'll answer the question for her and we'll see if she agrees.\n\n47:10.160 --> 47:15.160\nSome movies are so like loud and big and weird and have such a time in your life.\n\n47:15.160 --> 47:17.160\nThat's why I've brought up the Xanadu comparison.\n\n47:17.160 --> 47:19.160\nThere's no arguing that Xanadu is a good movie.\n\n47:19.160 --> 47:23.160\nXanadu is an insane movie, though, and it was part of my childhood.\n\n47:23.160 --> 47:27.160\nAll right, go, Shannon.\n\n47:27.160 --> 47:29.160\nSo when someone asks, do you like it ironically or not ironically?\n\n47:29.160 --> 47:31.160\nNo, I like Mac and me ironically.\n\n47:31.160 --> 47:35.160\nLike, that's a horrible movie and I don't actually have any connection to it.\n\n47:35.160 --> 47:37.160\nBut you have an emotional connection to a...\n\n47:37.160 --> 47:38.160\nI do.\n\n47:38.160 --> 47:39.160\nSpace Jam.\n\n47:39.160 --> 47:42.160\nBut you could probably recognize with your adult brain.\n\n47:42.160 --> 47:43.160\nYes.\n\n47:43.160 --> 47:44.160\nYes.\n\n47:44.160 --> 47:45.160\nBut that doesn't...\n\n47:45.160 --> 47:49.160\nYou know, it doesn't stop me from having kind of an emotional reaction to it even now in adulthood.\n\n47:49.160 --> 47:51.160\nAnd there's a lot of movies.\n\n47:51.160 --> 47:53.160\nGoonies, I'm looking at you.\n\n47:53.160 --> 48:00.160\nLike, my generation, I'm 40 now, I can finally start saying this without getting booed because I'm getting so old.\n\n48:00.160 --> 48:09.160\nBut 10 years ago, if I said Goonies was shitty, which it is, it is.\n\n48:09.160 --> 48:16.160\nGoonies is a ridiculous cacophony of logical loop-to-loops.\n\n48:16.160 --> 48:27.160\nIt is an insane, it is an opera written by a madman in a footlocker at the bottom of the ocean.\n\n48:27.160 --> 48:29.160\nGoonies is out of the show.\n\n48:29.160 --> 48:33.160\nWhat's a better movie as a whole, Space Jam or Goonies?\n\n48:33.160 --> 48:35.160\nSpace Jam.\n\n48:35.160 --> 48:36.160\nNo, fuck you.\n\n48:36.160 --> 48:38.160\nNo, Goonies is better than Space Jam.\n\n48:38.160 --> 48:40.160\nYou pushed him.\n\n48:40.160 --> 48:41.160\nI almost had him.\n\n48:41.160 --> 48:43.160\nGoonies is better than Space Jam.\n\n48:43.160 --> 48:50.160\nGoonies, okay, here's the difference between a sociopath and a regular murderer.\n\n48:50.160 --> 48:54.160\nGoonies knows what it's doing wrong.\n\n48:54.160 --> 48:58.160\nSpace Jam will kill again if you don't lock it up.\n\n48:58.160 --> 49:00.160\nSpace Jam has no idea.\n\n49:00.160 --> 49:01.160\nSpace Jam's like, what?\n\n49:01.160 --> 49:03.160\nYeah, I'm a movie.\n\n49:03.160 --> 49:06.160\nGoonies is like, I'm a movie.\n\n49:06.160 --> 49:10.160\nThey know, they know.\n\n49:10.160 --> 49:18.160\nIf there was a Goonies too, we'd focus on the chunk character more and do more blender scenes.\n\n49:18.160 --> 49:22.160\nSpace Jam would be like, well, what have we learned?\n\n49:22.160 --> 49:24.160\nCha-ching?\n\n49:24.160 --> 49:27.160\nI don't feel like Space Jam knew what it was doing.\n\n49:27.160 --> 49:30.160\nShannon, how many times have you seen Space Jam?\n\n49:30.160 --> 49:32.160\nHow many times have you viewed Space Jam?\n\n49:32.160 --> 49:37.160\nIn my childhood, probably in the dozens, I haven't seen it in quite a while,\n\n49:37.160 --> 49:41.160\nbecause my parents have it on VHS and nobody fucking has a VCR anymore.\n\n49:41.160 --> 49:43.160\nAlright.\n\n49:43.160 --> 49:44.160\nReally?\n\n49:44.160 --> 49:47.160\nSpace Jam party.\n\n49:47.160 --> 49:49.160\nI'm sure it's Space Jam's on YouTube.\n\n49:49.160 --> 49:51.160\nI don't know.\n\n49:51.160 --> 49:54.160\nI'm 40, I don't care.\n\n49:54.160 --> 49:57.160\nIs it Space Jam and one of your little friendship bracelets?\n\n49:57.160 --> 50:00.160\nCan't you just download it on a USB dongle?\n\n50:00.160 --> 50:04.160\nShannon, what are your favorite movies of all time?\n\n50:04.160 --> 50:08.160\nWhat do you think of as your favorite genre, your favorite kind of movie?\n\n50:08.160 --> 50:10.160\nOr your favorite, do you have a favorite movie?\n\n50:10.160 --> 50:12.160\nMy favorite movie is Stripes, actually.\n\n50:12.160 --> 50:14.160\nStripes is a good name.\n\n50:14.160 --> 50:16.160\nWhen's the last time you saw it?\n\n50:16.160 --> 50:18.160\nProbably in the last year, I haven't on DVD.\n\n50:18.160 --> 50:21.160\nI mean, some of these movies you go back to, like Back to the Future,\n\n50:21.160 --> 50:23.160\nI saw Double Future, Back to the Future and Goonies,\n\n50:23.160 --> 50:27.160\nand it was like a, because they're both right around the same time,\n\n50:27.160 --> 50:32.160\nbut it was like a study in, okay, there are movies from a certain age\n\n50:32.160 --> 50:34.160\nwhen your brain was like firing certain chemicals,\n\n50:34.160 --> 50:37.160\nlike you have permanent imprints on these movies,\n\n50:37.160 --> 50:41.160\nand I would call them identical walking into that theater as a 30-something.\n\n50:41.160 --> 50:43.160\nI was like, I'm going to see Goonies in Back to the Future too.\n\n50:43.160 --> 50:49.160\nIndelible, comparable, like masterpieces from my childhood era,\n\n50:49.160 --> 50:51.160\nbut walking out of the theater, I was like, okay, come on,\n\n50:51.160 --> 50:55.160\nGoonies was a nostalgic mess.\n\n50:55.160 --> 50:59.160\nBack to the Future, I think Remains is kind of a well-structured\n\n50:59.160 --> 51:03.160\nlittle piece of cinema that took seven years to write and blah, blah, blah.\n\n51:03.160 --> 51:05.160\nWhat were we talking about?\n\n51:05.160 --> 51:06.160\nSpace Jam.\n\n51:06.160 --> 51:09.160\nSpace Jam versus Stripes.\n\n51:09.160 --> 51:12.160\nStripes, I'm afraid to go back and watch, is my point.\n\n51:12.160 --> 51:13.160\nWhy would you be afraid?\n\n51:13.160 --> 51:16.160\nI'm just afraid it will be Goonies rather than Back to the Future.\n\n51:16.160 --> 51:23.160\nStripes is hilarious because there's 11 35-year-olds pretending to join the military.\n\n51:23.160 --> 51:28.160\nThere's clearly people in their 40s that are in this unit, it's really funny.\n\n51:28.160 --> 51:34.160\nEverybody's drunk in it, John Candy, John Lyric, everybody's just a bunch of alcoholics.\n\n51:34.160 --> 51:35.160\nRemember what that movie is?\n\n51:35.160 --> 51:38.160\nIt has a very strange, it's got a three-act structure overall,\n\n51:38.160 --> 51:42.160\nbut it also exists in two giant acts because there's the point where they actually,\n\n51:42.160 --> 51:46.160\nlike in the 11th hour, but the movie's only halfway over.\n\n51:46.160 --> 51:49.160\nIt seems like the movie is over and then we have a whole other plot happening.\n\n51:49.160 --> 51:52.160\nIt turns into this weird action movie with the RV and stuff, but it was good.\n\n51:52.160 --> 51:55.160\nIt shares that with the good Batman movie.\n\n51:55.160 --> 51:58.160\nThat Batman movie was like, what the fuck, when's this over?\n\n51:58.160 --> 51:59.160\nI don't care, I don't know.\n\n51:59.160 --> 52:04.160\nAll right, now, okay, truck chase, okay, fuck it.\n\n52:04.160 --> 52:08.160\nIt was...\n\n52:08.160 --> 52:10.160\nWell, thank you, Shannon, Shannon, everybody.\n\n52:10.160 --> 52:17.160\nShannon, thanks for coming up and talking about Space Jam.\n\n52:17.160 --> 52:18.160\nSpace Jam.\n\n52:18.160 --> 52:20.160\nWhat did they come up with that name too?\n\n52:20.160 --> 52:22.160\nI'll tell you exactly where they came up with that name.\n\n52:22.160 --> 52:24.160\nThey tested each letter of each word.\n\n52:24.160 --> 52:29.160\nOkay, so far, we've got spud cum.\n\n52:29.160 --> 52:33.160\nNo, no, no, people like a more than you.\n\n52:33.160 --> 52:36.160\nSpace spade cum?\n\n52:36.160 --> 52:39.160\nI always thought it was because there was jock jams at that point, right?\n\n52:39.160 --> 52:40.160\nWasn't there a thing where...\n\n52:40.160 --> 52:41.160\nI don't know.\n\n52:41.160 --> 52:45.160\nI would like to be a fly on any wall during any part of any branch.\n\n52:45.160 --> 52:47.160\nAdam Goldberg, why was it called Space Jam?\n\n52:47.160 --> 52:49.160\nThey used jam all the time in the 90s.\n\n52:49.160 --> 52:52.160\nIt was the number one word, the way rad ruled the 80s.\n\n52:52.160 --> 52:54.160\nAnd agent.\n\n52:54.160 --> 52:56.160\nThat's not your name.\n\n52:56.160 --> 52:58.160\nAdam Goldberg is my name.\n\n52:58.160 --> 53:01.160\nAnd consulting producer on community, Adam F. Goldberg's name.\n\n53:01.160 --> 53:03.160\nNot the same person.\n\n53:03.160 --> 53:04.160\nOkay, that was my fault.\n\n53:04.160 --> 53:06.160\nThat was my bad.\n\n53:06.160 --> 53:10.160\nNo, I tapped that hornet's nest.\n\n53:10.160 --> 53:13.160\nWhen he started saying they used jam all the time in the 90s,\n\n53:13.160 --> 53:15.160\nI was like, wait a minute, come on.\n\n53:15.160 --> 53:17.160\nI thought he meant jelly?\n\n53:17.160 --> 53:19.160\nNo.\n\n53:19.160 --> 53:20.160\nCome on, no more than the 80s.\n\n53:20.160 --> 53:22.160\nI was there for all of this.\n\n53:22.160 --> 53:25.160\nJam did not become a bigger thing.\n\n53:25.160 --> 53:27.160\nI'm officially my grandparents.\n\n53:27.160 --> 53:28.160\nThe 90s had...\n\n53:28.160 --> 53:31.160\nCome on, young man, jam is a universal...\n\n53:31.160 --> 53:34.160\nThe 90s did have jock jams and pearl jams,\n\n53:34.160 --> 53:36.160\nand we had less than 90s jam.\n\n53:36.160 --> 53:39.160\nJam, jock jams and pearl jams.\n\n53:39.160 --> 53:41.160\nIsn't that gross if they name their band Pearl Jam?\n\n53:41.160 --> 53:42.160\nThat's gross.\n\n53:42.160 --> 53:43.160\nPearl jam sucks.\n\n53:43.160 --> 53:44.160\nFuck Pearl Jam.\n\n53:44.160 --> 53:45.160\nOh, come on, Jeff.\n\n53:45.160 --> 53:46.160\nOh, fuck him, that's terrible.\n\n53:46.160 --> 53:48.160\nHey, Jeff.\n\n53:48.160 --> 53:52.160\nWhy are you going to make me feel bad about my band?\n\n53:52.160 --> 53:54.160\nOh, Eddie.\n\n53:54.160 --> 53:57.160\nNo.\n\n53:57.160 --> 53:59.160\nWe are people.\n\n53:59.160 --> 54:04.160\nWe have feelings you brought them.\n\n54:04.160 --> 54:06.160\nIt was the 90s.\n\n54:06.160 --> 54:08.160\nIt was a great time to be an angry white guy\n\n54:08.160 --> 54:10.160\nand be all bummed out and wear a fucking helmet.\n\n54:10.160 --> 54:13.160\nBefore we called it emo and just kind of like,\n\n54:13.160 --> 54:15.160\nboth embraced it and wrote it off,\n\n54:15.160 --> 54:18.160\nbut it was like it was being presented as if this is the new thing.\n\n54:18.160 --> 54:20.160\nI think that was uncomfortable for people.\n\n54:20.160 --> 54:23.160\nAnd I invite all of you to tell me I'm a bad person online\n\n54:23.160 --> 54:25.160\nfor not liking Pearl Jam.\n\n54:25.160 --> 54:26.160\nIt's going to happen.\n\n54:26.160 --> 54:27.160\nThere will be a lot of bad...\n\n54:27.160 --> 54:28.160\nI don't think that's going to happen.\n\n54:28.160 --> 54:29.160\nYeah, you know why?\n\n54:29.160 --> 54:30.160\nBecause they're indefensible.\n\n54:30.160 --> 54:32.160\nPearl Jam is an unsupportable band.\n\n54:32.160 --> 54:33.160\nThey'll accept.\n\n54:33.160 --> 54:35.160\nThese guys, look at them.\n\n54:35.160 --> 54:36.160\nLook out in this audience.\n\n54:36.160 --> 54:37.160\nLook at these jams.\n\n54:37.160 --> 54:38.160\nShannon, do you love Pearl Jam too?\n\n54:38.160 --> 54:39.160\nNo.\n\n54:39.160 --> 54:40.160\nOkay, good.\n\n54:40.160 --> 54:41.160\nSo she's not just jam-centric.\n\n54:41.160 --> 54:42.160\nNo.\n\n54:42.160 --> 54:45.160\nThese guys are post-itunes.\n\n54:45.160 --> 54:48.160\nThey're little tune babies.\n\n54:48.160 --> 54:53.160\nThey have little hologram dongles that they use to subscribe to their music\n\n54:53.160 --> 54:55.160\nfrom a stream and a cloud.\n\n54:55.160 --> 55:00.160\nAnd part of that is that they don't have the same emotional...\n\n55:00.160 --> 55:06.160\nThey go, oh, did you hear that new granddaddy?\n\n55:06.160 --> 55:11.160\nI heard that EP was an LP on the SP.\n\n55:11.160 --> 55:13.160\nNo, I don't.\n\n55:13.160 --> 55:15.160\nI don't either.\n\n55:15.160 --> 55:18.160\nI'm just trying to get through it.\n\n55:18.160 --> 55:21.160\nYou had to put all this energy into buying an album.\n\n55:21.160 --> 55:26.160\nSpencer, if you bought a Led Zeppelin album and someone else said Led Zeppelin sucked,\n\n55:26.160 --> 55:27.160\nyou got something to defend.\n\n55:27.160 --> 55:33.160\nBut if you download Zigger Splicket, you don't care.\n\n55:33.160 --> 55:36.160\nYou got a whole fucking catalog of shit.\n\n55:36.160 --> 55:42.160\nEveryone's an individual, so they don't really care that much if someone goes like,\n\n55:42.160 --> 55:45.160\nand no one's gonna go, that's stupid, that sucks.\n\n55:45.160 --> 55:51.160\nI think maybe I'm projecting onto them my wishes for the younger generation to be more actualized.\n\n55:51.160 --> 55:53.160\nSpencer, are you a music purchaser?\n\n55:53.160 --> 55:55.160\nAre you a music guy?\n\n55:55.160 --> 55:56.160\nNo.\n\n55:56.160 --> 55:58.160\nI mean, I listen to lots of music.\n\n55:58.160 --> 56:00.160\nI don't purchase a lot of music.\n\n56:00.160 --> 56:03.160\nHow do you get your music?\n\n56:03.160 --> 56:10.160\nYou know, sometimes I'm just on my computer, and this is legal stuff, man.\n\n56:10.160 --> 56:14.160\nThey're gonna listen to this podcast, and they're gonna hunt me down.\n\n56:14.160 --> 56:20.160\nSometimes a bit just falls on me, and then sometimes more of them come in like a torrent.\n\n56:20.160 --> 56:24.160\nSometimes you just get caught in a tempest of fights.\n\n56:24.160 --> 56:29.160\nOf peer-to-peer pressure.\n\n56:29.160 --> 56:31.160\nSo you've been stealing music online all the time?\n\n56:31.160 --> 56:41.160\nI mean, I've bought maybe three albums in my life, but I mean, like, six days of music probably.\n\n56:41.160 --> 56:43.160\nBut I don't know, it's really eclectic.\n\n56:43.160 --> 56:47.160\nI usually get discographies, and then I'm like, oh, I like this album and this album,\n\n56:47.160 --> 56:51.160\nand delete a lot of stuff, and then I have what I like, and I kind of just cycle through it randomly.\n\n56:51.160 --> 56:53.160\nWhat's in heavy rotation for you right now?\n\n56:53.160 --> 56:54.160\nWhat's in the car?\n\n56:54.160 --> 56:55.160\nLet's see.\n\n56:55.160 --> 56:59.160\nBorders of Canada has some good tracks.\n\n56:59.160 --> 57:03.160\nYeah, I think the campfire head phase is the album I've been listening to a lot.\n\n57:03.160 --> 57:10.160\nThere's Delorean is a band with an album called Subiza, which is just really delicious.\n\n57:10.160 --> 57:17.160\nGold Panda makes this really weird electronic music, and it's pretty awesome.\n\n57:17.160 --> 57:22.160\nI listened to it on an airport, and it was perfect.\n\n57:22.160 --> 57:23.160\nWhat about Nosecone?\n\n57:23.160 --> 57:24.160\nYou listen to Nosecone?\n\n57:24.160 --> 57:28.160\nOh yeah, you know, Nosecone, he had some deep YouTube riffs.\n\n57:28.160 --> 57:29.160\nI was really into that.\n\n57:29.160 --> 57:30.160\nWait, I just made that name up.\n\n57:30.160 --> 57:32.160\nI was ripping the audio, yeah.\n\n57:32.160 --> 57:34.160\nNo, I'm bullshitting also.\n\n57:34.160 --> 57:35.160\nOh, okay.\n\n57:35.160 --> 57:40.160\nI thought I ripped a real guy, and I wanted to cop to it.\n\n57:40.160 --> 57:41.160\nI felt bad.\n\n57:41.160 --> 57:42.160\nI sent me to play some D&D.\n\n57:42.160 --> 57:43.160\nHow's that sound right now?\n\n57:43.160 --> 57:45.160\nWell, we got to get Camille out here.\n\n57:45.160 --> 57:46.160\nCamille.\n\n57:46.160 --> 57:51.160\nCamille, you like Nosecone?\n\n57:51.160 --> 57:53.160\nNo, I like the Peaceful Mutants.\n\n57:53.160 --> 57:54.160\nThey're really good right now.\n\n57:54.160 --> 57:55.160\nSandblast.\n\n57:55.160 --> 57:58.160\nI have a couple of points to make.\n\n57:58.160 --> 58:04.160\nSpace Jam is clearly from NBA Jam, which was a huge basketball game in the night.\n\n58:04.160 --> 58:08.160\nDon't clap, Adam Goldberg, as if that's what you were saying.\n\n58:08.160 --> 58:12.160\nThe other point, you gave it so much shit for exposition.\n\n58:12.160 --> 58:19.160\nYou got to jump through a lot of hoops to get Elmer Fudd and Michael Jordan in the same room.\n\n58:19.160 --> 58:26.160\nYou can't just be like, open on basketball court. Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan are hanging out.\n\n58:26.160 --> 58:30.160\nOkay, here's how many hoops you have to jump through to get Elmer Fudd and Michael Jordan in the same room.\n\n58:30.160 --> 58:34.160\nThe same number of hoops that they jumped to get Michael Jordan in the same room.\n\n58:34.160 --> 58:39.160\nOne, they jumped Michael Jordan through a literal and figurative threshold.\n\n58:39.160 --> 58:45.160\nThey sucked him through a golf course hole into Cartoonland, and Elmer Fudd was right there.\n\n58:45.160 --> 58:50.160\nAnd said, oh hi, Michael Jordan, I love you.\n\n58:50.160 --> 58:53.160\nThey're a crime that they committed.\n\n58:53.160 --> 58:56.160\nBy the way, I am not defending this movie at all.\n\n58:56.160 --> 58:59.160\nJust for fun, defend it.\n\n58:59.160 --> 59:03.160\nIt's really good.\n\n59:03.160 --> 59:11.160\nYou're saying it's a necessary evil because of a subject matter that there needs to be five thresholds instead of one threshold.\n\n59:11.160 --> 59:16.160\nYou're saying that will never be true until our son Supernovas.\n\n59:16.160 --> 59:20.160\nOur stories are allowed to just have one fucking like what if.\n\n59:20.160 --> 59:25.160\nI've never full disclosure, never seen the movie.\n\n59:25.160 --> 59:29.160\nOr finish the word disclosure. Never done that.\n\n59:29.160 --> 59:33.160\nFull disclosure.\n\n59:33.160 --> 59:38.160\nCan I also, you were talking about human planet, can I quickly say what my favorite thing of that is?\n\n59:38.160 --> 59:39.160\nSpeak it will.\n\n59:39.160 --> 59:42.160\nIt's all like humans in extreme conditions.\n\n59:42.160 --> 59:46.160\nPapa Nagini, there's this one village that just eats sharks.\n\n59:46.160 --> 59:50.160\nThat's all they eat, which is like sort of an arrogant dickish move, you know?\n\n59:50.160 --> 59:53.160\nThey're like, you have fruit. What are you doing?\n\n59:53.160 --> 59:55.160\nThey're like, well, sharks, we eat them for breakfast.\n\n59:55.160 --> 59:57.160\nLike that's what they're going for.\n\n59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.160\nSo they have one guy in the village who's the designated shark hunter.\n\n01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.160\nAnd now he's like 70, and then they just like send this guy out.\n\n01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.160\nHe's like, all right, I'll go get more shark. And he gets into a canoe that he's made.\n\n01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.160\nAnd he's like seven and he's like ripped.\n\n01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.160\nAre these the guys that just like strangled him on the side of the boat?\n\n01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.160\nYeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I was going to tell the story.\n\n01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.160\nSorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:22.160\nHe's like super ripped like, but he's like like Nepal ripped, you know, not like Jim ripped.\n\n01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.160\nLike Sri Lanka ripped. So he gets into the boat.\n\n01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.160\nAnd he goes.\n\n01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.160\nI want to be Sri Lanka ripped.\n\n01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.160\nIt's great. It's great.\n\n01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:36.160\nAnd he just goes to the middle of the ocean and then he starts singing his shark beckoning song.\n\n01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.160\nNo, I fucking swear to you.\n\n01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.160\nYeah, well, I don't want to do the song for you because even flu.\n\n01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.160\nYeah, that's what it is.\n\n01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.160\nIt would sound like this.\n\n01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:52.160\nWhat the song sounds like pretend you're a racist and then imagine a tribal song.\n\n01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.160\nThat's what it sounds like.\n\n01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.160\nDo it. Do it. Just do it.\n\n01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.160\nNow that you just claimed it by saying it sounds racist.\n\n01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.160\nPearl Jam.\n\n01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.160\nPearl Jam. You're doing Pearl Jam.\n\n01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.160\nYeah, it's a lot like Pearl Jam.\n\n01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.160\nAnd then he sings this fucking song with just a hint of Hepburn.\n\n01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.160\nJust a shining army.\n\n01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:21.160\nIt's a little bit like what was that song sadness?\n\n01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.160\nEverything's going backwards or whatever.\n\n01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.160\nCandescence, what's it called?\n\n01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.160\nEnigma.\n\n01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.160\nEnigma.\n\n01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.160\nSo he starts singing this fucking song, okay?\n\n01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.160\nAnd he's singing it all day and all night.\n\n01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.160\nThere's no food because they run out of shark.\n\n01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.160\nAll day, all night on day three, a shark shows up.\n\n01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.160\nAnd even then John Hurt is like...\n\n01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.160\nAnd he has the balls to assume it's the song.\n\n01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.160\nI know.\n\n01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.160\nI want to go up to the guy and be like, try once without the song.\n\n01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.160\nOne time a control group.\n\n01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.160\nExactly. Just once.\n\n01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:58.160\nEither I believe it was a coincidence or that the magical shark beckoning song works\n\n01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.160\nand everything I know is lies, you know?\n\n01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:06.160\nIt only takes six days to test the theory that without a song, the shark takes twice as long as you show it.\n\n01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.160\nJust do it once.\n\n01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.160\nSo the shark shows up and then he starts fashioning a noose,\n\n01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.160\nwhich I'm like, have the noose already fashioned?\n\n01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.160\nYou've been there for three days.\n\n01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.160\nGet the new, act like you've been there, you know?\n\n01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.160\nSo he...\n\n01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160\nYeah, B do have.\n\n01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.160\nYeah, B do...\n\n01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.160\nSo he...\n\n01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.160\nAlways be noose-making.\n\n01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.160\nBut this is my favorite part.\n\n01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.160\nHe always be noose-making.\n\n01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.160\nShark is for closers.\n\n01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.160\nI've got a 12-foot boat.\n\n01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.160\nI've got a custom-made shark noose.\n\n01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.160\nThat's my name.\n\n01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.160\nWho the fuck are you?\n\n01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.160\nDavid Mammet presents...\n\n01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.160\nThe Shark Stranglers.\n\n01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:48.160\nSo he fashions this noose and as the shark...\n\n01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.160\nThis is my favorite part.\n\n01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.160\nAs the shark is going by, he lassoes the shark in the open ocean.\n\n01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.160\nHe lassoes it and then I swear, he lassoes it and then he does like a fist pump.\n\n01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.160\nHe's like, yes.\n\n01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.160\nSo I'm like, we're all human.\n\n01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.160\nEverybody does that.\n\n01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160\nYeah.\n\n01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.160\nBecause like that's the only gesture we have.\n\n01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.160\nYou might have picked that up from the camera crew.\n\n01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.160\nAmazing.\n\n01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.160\nThey were like, holy shit, I have just enough SD card to store that footage.\n\n01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.160\nYeah.\n\n01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.160\nAnd he was like, oh really?\n\n01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.160\nYeah.\n\n01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.160\nExactly.\n\n01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.160\nSo like the SD card gesture.\n\n01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.160\nI wonder that when they're getting the shots.\n\n01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.160\nIt's like clearly you're getting the shot from a jeep, but you're studying these guys\n\n01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.160\nwho just hang out with wearing blankets for shirts and bluffing lines.\n\n01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.160\nI mean, the gods must be crazy.\n\n01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160\nWhat's happening here?\n\n01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160\nIs that contamination?\n\n01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:32.160\nI always thought there was, like a couple years ago they found a new tribe in the Amazon\n\n01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.160\nand all the pictures were like, they were like, you know, they were like looking up at this\n\n01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.160\nthing, this helicopter and they were like, we didn't want to disturb them.\n\n01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.160\nWe didn't want to go down.\n\n01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.160\nYou've already changed everything.\n\n01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.160\nThat helicopter is their god now.\n\n01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.160\nIt's like Iceman.\n\n01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.160\nYeah.\n\n01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.160\nThey're going to go back and be like, burn the books.\n\n01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.160\nThis is all lies.\n\n01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.160\nLook at that thing.\n\n01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.160\nLook at that.\n\n01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.160\nTodd, what have I been saying?\n\n01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.160\nYeah.\n\n01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.160\nSee, I told you.\n\n01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160\nMadeleine Burr.\n\n01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.160\nI used to worship a toucan.\n\n01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.160\nLook at that fucking thing.\n\n01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.160\nThere's three of us inside that toucan.\n\n01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.160\nThey're clearly like, all of them have like their bows and arrows out, like pointing\n\n01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.160\nat this thing.\n\n01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.160\nYou've changed everything.\n\n01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.160\nYou don't even mean like-\n\n01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.160\nThat's a clear example of that.\n\n01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.160\nThose guys actually live in actual isolation and that kind of contamination.\n\n01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.160\nBut also there's just like, these people, they know what a Jeep is and they know what\n\n01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.160\na camera crew is.\n\n01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.160\nThey're bringing a camera crew along and they're saying like, the camera crew is going, show\n\n01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:37.160\nus how you bring your 18 cattle from 600 miles across the desert.\n\n01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.160\nAnd then have a weird negotiation with the elephants with a stick in order to get your\n\n01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.160\ncattle fed.\n\n01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.160\nAnd that's like, I just mean like emotional, psychological, long-term contamination of\n\n01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.160\nlike this 16-year-old kid going like-\n\n01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.160\nYes.\n\n01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.160\nFuck.\n\n01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.160\nGo faster in a Jeep.\n\n01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.160\nYeah.\n\n01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.160\nAll right, see you later.\n\n01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.160\nThat's a wrap.\n\n01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.160\nYeah.\n\n01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.160\nThey should just show them on their iPad like Phantom Menace.\n\n01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.160\nLike, watch this.\n\n01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.160\nAll right, we're going to go.\n\n01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.160\nYeah.\n\n01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.160\nLike, yeah, I don't know.\n\n01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.160\nI mean, it's so weird.\n\n01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.160\nLike, that's not- everyone knows it's weird.\n\n01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.160\nErin McGathy, you're here tonight?\n\n01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.160\nLet's get Erin McGathy up here, shall we?\n\n01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.160\nErin McGathy.\n\n01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:15.160\nThe only thing I just saw Leprechaun in the hood, the only thing I wanted from that movie\n\n01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:19.160\nwas the Leprechaun to refer to as part of gold as bling.\n\n01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.160\nThat is all I wanted out of it.\n\n01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.160\nThat might have come- the bling might have happened after the first Leprechaun in the\n\n01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.160\nhood.\n\n01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.160\nMaybe, because I didn't- he was never like, ah, it gets to me bling or whatever.\n\n01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:37.160\nThey really like- it was a very selective like a membrane in terms of what racism got\n\n01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.160\nthrough and what they refused it to.\n\n01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.160\nIt's very weird.\n\n01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:44.160\nLike, you'd look at one example and go like, well, that's just- that's just ridiculous.\n\n01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.160\nLike, why would you do that?\n\n01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.160\nAnd then the other one would go, well, why would you choke up on that bat?\n\n01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:58.160\nI can't think of examples, but the- when you watch Leprechaun tonight, here's an interesting\n\n01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.160\nthing.\n\n01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:06.160\nThere's a point in the movie where he has beguiled this trio of Hoochie mamas, badonkadonks.\n\n01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.160\nI don't know what you'd call them in the-\n\n01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.160\nI think that's the preferred nomenclature.\n\n01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.160\nYeah.\n\n01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.160\nThey're zombie fly ladies.\n\n01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.160\nThey're zombie fly ladies.\n\n01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160\nThey're zombie fly ladies.\n\n01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.160\nAnd that's right.\n\n01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.160\nIt's a sort of multi-ethnic, like, trio of like, yeah, they have green eyes underneath\n\n01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:25.160\ntheir ray bands and they have like gold tight-fitting lame dresses and they don't match with their\n\n01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.160\nshoes.\n\n01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.160\nThey don't explain where they came from except through some weird ADR line.\n\n01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.160\nThen they're just there.\n\n01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.160\nThen during the ending credits, you see the origin.\n\n01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.160\nHe does a rap in a-\n\n01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.160\nOh, that's right.\n\n01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.160\nWhich you'd expect to see in a movie called Leprechaun Into Hood.\n\n01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.160\nYou'd expect to see where David's do a rap.\n\n01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.160\nAnd he doesn't do it until the ending credits.\n\n01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.160\nAnd he's like, oh, my name is Leprechaun.\n\n01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.160\nI'm here to say I just came from Dublin to the shuttle today.\n\n01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:57.160\nI got my bling-bling bloom and my blarney stone and I'll possess your mind and you're not alone.\n\n01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:03.160\nAnd while he's doing it, he's like hypnotizing these fly girls in this bar that we never\n\n01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.160\nsaw in the movie.\n\n01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:09.160\nSo it seems very clear to me that they extracted that scene from the middle of the movie where\n\n01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.160\nit really belonged.\n\n01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:16.160\nAnd the only reason I can think that they extracted it is that they actually hit some kind of\n\n01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:20.160\nthreshold where people, the test viewers are like, yeah, you know what, come on.\n\n01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.160\nI want to make fun of the movie.\n\n01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.160\nI don't want you to piranha 3D me.\n\n01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.160\nThey actually hit a tipping point where people are like, fuck you.\n\n01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:35.160\nWhen he started rapping, it's like, well, what's my job?\n\n01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.160\nI'm supposed to get high and watch a movie.\n\n01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.160\nIf you guys are high, fuck you.\n\n01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.160\nAnd they went, oh, you know what?\n\n01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.160\nYeah, people like that it's campy.\n\n01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.160\nThey like that it's stupid and they want to make fun of the movie.\n\n01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:50.160\nWe need to actually commit to our job and move this rap number to the ending credits.\n\n01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:55.160\nI thought you were saying that they'd hit too many cultural urban things.\n\n01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.160\nAnd then people were like, all right, that's too much shit.\n\n01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.160\nAnd then over the credits, you can be as offensive as you want.\n\n01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.160\nThat wasn't my guess.\n\n01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.160\nTruthfully on that topic, I felt like all of pound for pound.\n\n01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:12.160\nI found myself going, I expected to be quote unquote offended.\n\n01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.160\nI expected to be going, what?\n\n01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.160\nWay more per minute.\n\n01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.160\nThis movie is kind of safe.\n\n01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.160\nIt was pretty safe for a movie called Leprechaun and the Hood.\n\n01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:27.160\nWarwick Davis has said little people write back like so many hundreds of years with his body of war.\n\n01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.160\nI mean, has he or is he?\n\n01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:36.160\nIt's like what, like, you know, like, wow, God, how do I get out of this?\n\n01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.160\nWhat I was going to say, like, it's true for a lot of like urban youth.\n\n01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.160\nThe way out is basketball or rapping.\n\n01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.160\nRight.\n\n01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.160\nAnd so for little people now it's like becoming in horror movie.\n\n01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:56.160\nAre you a hero if you get into the NBA or are you perpetuating like a cycle of like, you know, unrealistic expectations or whatever that you would call it.\n\n01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.160\nNo idea.\n\n01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:07.160\nBut I want to see a one act black box theater production about a mythical meeting on a fateful 1998 night between Peter Dinklage and Warwick Davis.\n\n01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.160\nHe's like, all right, I'm going to go to the right.\n\n01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160\nYou go to the left.\n\n01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.160\nI'm going to do eventually Game of Thrones and movies that are Oscars.\n\n01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.160\nYou can rap in an Irish accent.\n\n01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:22.160\nLike they do plays of like what if, what if on the eve of his assassination, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X like had a conversation.\n\n01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.160\nLike they do plays like that.\n\n01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.160\nThat's really funny.\n\n01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.160\nDinklage and Warwick Davis.\n\n01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.160\nI bet they hate each other.\n\n01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:38.160\nBut you have, you have normal people play the like non little people because you're like, like, like, no, the big draw here is that, you know, this is, I mean, God, this is David Strathain for God's sake.\n\n01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.160\nYou just tie like shoes at their knees.\n\n01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.160\nIs that what you're suggesting?\n\n01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.160\nDoor style?\n\n01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.160\nMaybe you just make the sets really.\n\n01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.160\nOr yeah, yeah, just make Lily Tomlin it.\n\n01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.160\nJust have giant chairs.\n\n01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:50.160\nIt's going to all be set at a real Abed restaurant.\n\n01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.160\nNo, that's the other way.\n\n01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.160\nIt's going to be the reverse of that.\n\n01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.160\nOr maybe it starts at Abed's restaurant and then they leave and you're like, oh no, everything.\n\n01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.160\nThere was little.\n\n01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.160\nYeah.\n\n01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.160\nYou don't know.\n\n01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.160\nHe says goodbye.\n\n01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.160\nThank you for coming to what's the name of Abed's restaurant?\n\n01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.160\nBites.\n\n01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.160\nBites.\n\n01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:13.160\nAnd then didn't you pitch an idea where it's just leftovers that it was like just bites, bites taken out of burgers and stuff?\n\n01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:20.160\nMy question was were there to be things shaped like the bite that somebody took or would it be a hamburger with a bite already taken out of it?\n\n01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.160\nNo, I think the appeal is that it's a miniature version of the truest.\n\n01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160\nYeah.\n\n01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.160\nAlthough that's a good idea.\n\n01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.160\nYeah.\n\n01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.160\nYou could call it, are you going to finish that?\n\n01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:37.160\nAll right, Spencer, get us up to date on the D&D.\n\n01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.160\nAll right, I won.\n\n01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.160\nLast town on Harmontown.\n\n01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.160\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.160\nLast town?\n\n01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.160\nWhat?\n\n01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.160\nSorry, go ahead.\n\n01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.160\nAfter fighting with a grip of sinister serpentine foes, Sharpie had been poisoned.\n\n01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.160\nAs the fast-acting poison coursed through his veins, the wizard fell into a deep slumber.\n\n01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:05.160\nRealizing what must be done, Mulraine Sedona donned her hat of disguise, taking the form of someone she thought must look like Sharpie's mother,\n\n01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.160\nbefore attempting some curious reprogramming on the sleeping mage.\n\n01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:17.160\nQuark and Christopher got uncomfortable and checked out some old statues to pass the time, but realizing the flaws in Mulraine's methodology,\n\n01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.160\nattempted to grease the wheels on the whole situation.\n\n01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.160\nAfter being gripped tightly by the dreaming wizard, Christopher freaked out and stabbed him with a knife,\n\n01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.160\nwaking the wizard with a quick prick.\n\n01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:32.160\nAfter some discussion, the group entered the larger chamber, bisected by a cracked staircase,\n\n01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.160\nand started to try and figure out some rope situations to get the treasure.\n\n01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:40.160\nTheir musings were interrupted by a powerful voice taunting them.\n\n01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.160\nA dragon!\n\n01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.160\nRecognizing the dire danger that this magical beast presented, the gang launched into action.\n\n01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.160\nThe barbarians slashed and raged and then tried to climb up to statue or something.\n\n01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.160\nMulraine fired arrows.\n\n01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:56.160\nSharpie summoned the monstrous scorpions Keith and David to distract and threaten the dragon,\n\n01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.160\nwhile the sneaky robes stabbed the dragon in the dick with a paralyzing syringe.\n\n01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:05.160\nThe attacks seemed to be working, but still the dragon fought on.\n\n01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:08.160\nSpencer, everybody.\n\n01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.160\nAnd again.\n\n01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:16.160\nI just remembered last week marked a milestone where we played D&D for like,\n\n01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.160\nit seemed like 40 minutes at the end of it, Spencer was like,\n\n01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.160\nyou guys have to stop.\n\n01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.160\nIt's gonna take a long time to kill that dragon.\n\n01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.160\nWhich was kind of a, it was a milestone because we were engrossed.\n\n01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.160\nIf you listen to the recording, we were like, we had finally stopped going like,\n\n01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:37.160\nD&D, like we gotta make sure it stays on, you know, like Cliffhanger and Spencer was like,\n\n01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.160\nyou guys knock it off, go to bed.\n\n01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:47.160\nI thought that you were just expecting me to truncate the combat at the end of the session sort of thing.\n\n01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.160\nAnd I'm like, no, no, there's a dragon.\n\n01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.160\nSo how many hits have we put on this dragon?\n\n01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:57.160\nLet's see, I think you hit it once, sliced it in the neck, he took an arrow or two,\n\n01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:01.160\nyou shot him in the, between the eyes, I think, and it made him look kind of slim.\n\n01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.160\nHe was in berserker rage and he did some stuff.\n\n01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.160\nYeah, and then, yeah, he hit him in a berserker rage and distracted him while you got in position.\n\n01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.160\nAnd then you went and tried to climb up a statue to jump off of it, but you failed the climb check.\n\n01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.160\nRight.\n\n01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.160\nYou summoned a scorpion, didn't do much.\n\n01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.160\nThen you summoned another scorpion.\n\n01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.160\nKeith and David.\n\n01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.160\nYeah, Keith and David.\n\n01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:27.160\nRight, so by popular demand, by popular hand wringing brow sweating demand,\n\n01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:31.160\ncheck in with us about our hit points and get definitive for the people,\n\n01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.160\nbecause they never know, people tweet me and they go,\n\n01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.160\nI don't know when to be concerned that you guys are about to die.\n\n01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.160\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.160\nWe don't pay attention to that because we're a bunch of drunk performers.\n\n01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.160\nWe never go, oh shit, I have three hit points.\n\n01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.160\nYeah, it's true.\n\n01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.160\nSharpie, right now you're at 24 hit points.\n\n01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.160\nSolid.\n\n01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.160\nOut of my 30.\n\n01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.160\nYeah, that's like, you have like a smoker's hit points.\n\n01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.160\nYeah.\n\n01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.160\nYeah.\n\n01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.160\nIt's not bad.\n\n01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.160\nYou're okay.\n\n01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.160\nWhat's the range?\n\n01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.160\nWell, you max out.\n\n01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:08.160\nEvery time you level up, your maximum hit points go up.\n\n01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.160\nLike a video game.\n\n01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.160\nNo, 24 solid.\n\n01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.160\nHow many does Chris de Burgh have right now?\n\n01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.160\nChris de Burgh is sitting pretty at 43.\n\n01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.160\nI don't think he's gotten hit this whole time, to be honest.\n\n01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.160\nYeah.\n\n01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.160\nYeah.\n\n01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.160\nMulraine has how many?\n\n01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160\nMulraine?\n\n01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.160\nYeah.\n\n01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.160\nRight now you have 35 on this.\n\n01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.160\nAnd I have a maximum of 51.\n\n01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.160\nI took a beating last time, didn't I?\n\n01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.160\nYeah, you're actually right now at 38.\n\n01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.160\nOh, we're all doing pretty well.\n\n01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.160\nNot bad.\n\n01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160\nNo, no.\n\n01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.160\nThat's true.\n\n01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.160\nAll right, so the dragon's still pacing the cage.\n\n01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.160\nAnd it's still got a numb dick, right?\n\n01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.160\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.160\nThe poison hasn't quite taken hold, but yeah.\n\n01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.160\nYeah, it was in the dick.\n\n01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.160\nAnd I have two scorpions in here.\n\n01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.160\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160\nKeith and David.\n\n01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.160\nYeah.\n\n01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.160\nIt's important.\n\n01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:01.160\nAnd I'm allowed to give them standing orders to attack the dragon.\n\n01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.160\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.160\nThey'll go on your turn.\n\n01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.160\nI'll try to remember.\n\n01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.160\nWhat up?\n\n01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.160\nI'm going to put it at Jeff's turn, unless anyone has any more questions.\n\n01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.160\nHave my far sword recharged?\n\n01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.160\nNo, it hasn't, in fact.\n\n01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.160\nAnd so can I do a flaming sword attack?\n\n01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.160\nYeah.\n\n01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.160\nAll right, flaming sword attack.\n\n01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.160\nFlaming sword attack.\n\n01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:29.160\nWith your flaming sword, you charge the dragon and slice towards his flesh, striking a quite decent blow at his chest.\n\n01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160\nYeah, here we go.\n\n01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.160\nDealing...\n\n01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.160\nI'm bad.\n\n01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.160\nI hate my sword.\n\n01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.160\nEleven damage.\n\n01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:46.160\nHow much damage did you deal to yourself, then?\n\n01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:55.160\nI'd say I lost a good three charisma points.\n\n01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.160\nYou know?\n\n01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.160\nAll right, so we give this guy a lot of hit points.\n\n01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.160\nHe's taking a beating.\n\n01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.160\nWho's next?\n\n01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:05.160\nYeah, let's just go down this way and then I'll go.\n\n01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.160\nIt'll be easier.\n\n01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:15.160\nIn this area where we are, is it possible to climb up so we have an advantage from above?\n\n01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.160\nThere are those statues.\n\n01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.160\nThey're a good 15, 20 feet tall.\n\n01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.160\nYou would be above him.\n\n01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.160\nCan I move silently up the statues?\n\n01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.160\nYeah, you can definitely try it, but it's pretty tricky to climb and be stealthy.\n\n01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:34.160\nSo, you know, if your attention is split, it'll be a bit tougher than if you just tried to clamber up it.\n\n01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.160\nOkay, well, I wink at Sharpie and I try to climb up the statues.\n\n01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.160\nAll right.\n\n01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160\nIs that two turns?\n\n01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.160\nWell, I officially retire.\n\n01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.160\nThe wink fails.\n\n01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.160\nOff the lumber, no number.\n\n01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.160\nToo high, no die.\n\n01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.160\nYeah, sorry guys.\n\n01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.160\nSpencer's 20s had a die fell off the table.\n\n01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.160\nYeah, for the podcast listeners.\n\n01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.160\nThat puts him at minus two for this dog leg right on the links.\n\n01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:04.160\nI mean, I guess you already rolled, but would it be too much to say I use the rope to climb up the statues?\n\n01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.160\nWell, I would assume you'd use the rope in some fashion.\n\n01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.160\nYeah, totally me too.\n\n01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.160\nSame page.\n\n01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.160\nIt's good you guys are on the same page.\n\n01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:19.160\nSo, throwing the rope over the shoulder of the statue, you catch it and begin to try and hoist yourself up,\n\n01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.160\nbut the arm of the statue actually breaks off and falls down.\n\n01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.160\nYou just...\n\n01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.160\nI take my food sack and I empty it out on the ground.\n\n01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.160\nThat's a roll of a two, by the way, you know.\n\n01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.160\nOh, that's right.\n\n01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.160\nFor the listeners.\n\n01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.160\nDid the John Williams score go,\n\n01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:40.160\nIt's so frustrating watching those movies.\n\n01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.160\nBlueballs.\n\n01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.160\nSo is it me now?\n\n01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.160\nYeah, that'd be you.\n\n01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.160\nYou're kind of lurking right now.\n\n01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.160\nAm I still stealthy right next to the dragon?\n\n01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:53.160\nYeah, he hasn't yet noticed you, but you know, he's a bit sluggish.\n\n01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.160\nYeah, because of the dick stabbing.\n\n01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.160\nYeah.\n\n01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.160\nThat'll happen.\n\n01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.160\nHe's not fucking anything soon.\n\n01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.160\nOr he has like great stamina, right?\n\n01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160\nCould go either way.\n\n01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.160\nYeah.\n\n01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:15.160\nSo do I have another poison dagger?\n\n01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.160\nYeah, you have a poison dagger.\n\n01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.160\nIt's true.\n\n01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:24.160\nCan I just stab him in the same dick?\n\n01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:30.160\nGo for a more vital part of him, like his head or his heart or something.\n\n01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.160\nHow many dicks do dragons have?\n\n01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:36.160\nThis is a question I've been asking for years.\n\n01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:42.160\nHow many dragons do you know?\n\n01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.160\nThat movie sucks.\n\n01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:49.160\nJust the one dick.\n\n01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.160\nJust the one dick.\n\n01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.160\nWhere is it a good idea to stab the...\n\n01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.160\nYou know, wherever you can.\n\n01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.160\nYou can't afford to be picky.\n\n01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.160\nAm I still close to the dick?\n\n01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.160\nYou're actually a good like 15 feet off at this point, you know.\n\n01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.160\nGet him in a major artery or a blood vessel or something.\n\n01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.160\nBut I don't know where that would be.\n\n01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.160\nThat's true, you wouldn't.\n\n01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:16.160\nAh, guys, I'm just gonna play it safe and stab him in the dick.\n\n01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.160\nGo with what you know, Christopher.\n\n01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.160\nYou are kind of a one hit one.\n\n01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.160\nYeah, with everything.\n\n01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.160\nI know one thing and I just fucking go at it.\n\n01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.160\nI mean, I guess don't change your...\n\n01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.160\nStabbing, yeah.\n\n01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:34.160\nStabbing in the dick is the dragon fighting version of Lady in Red.\n\n01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.160\nI'm sorry to think that a dragon dick hurt you in the past.\n\n01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:44.160\nOr just a dick that to him was larger when he was at a certain age.\n\n01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:50.160\nSo as a rogue, you have the ability to sneak attack, which means if they're kind of unaware of you, you can do extra damage.\n\n01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.160\nSo you want to go for that probably, right?\n\n01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:57.160\nYeah, and the good thing is his dick is already numb, so it'll do damage, but he won't know that I'm there.\n\n01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.160\nHe'll just be bleeding out and he won't even know.\n\n01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.160\nIt's crazy.\n\n01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:04.160\nNo, I'm enthusiastic about this twist.\n\n01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.160\nHonestly.\n\n01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.160\nI hope he isn't.\n\n01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.160\nI hope he isn't either.\n\n01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:15.160\nYeah, okay, striking him directly in the dick with a poison dagger.\n\n01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.160\nYou score a seemingly nice cut.\n\n01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.160\nScore?\n\n01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.160\nYeah.\n\n01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160\nScore?\n\n01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:24.160\nNice cut.\n\n01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:29.160\nThis is the funk break.\n\n01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:35.160\nI'm just pitching a music video right now of a dragon looking down at his numb dick.\n\n01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:38.160\nAnd there's like rose petals falling from the sky.\n\n01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:42.160\nNever seen a dragon have such a numb dick.\n\n01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:46.160\nNever seen an illa sing.\n\n01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:50.160\nAfter I stabbed it.\n\n01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.160\nSo a pretty good slice?\n\n01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.160\nYeah, pretty good slice.\n\n01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:59.160\nYou could tell the poison poured in to the phallus.\n\n01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.160\nSo you got paralyzing poison.\n\n01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.160\nYou got that red poison, I think it was, the dagger.\n\n01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.160\nGuys, I'm doing great work there.\n\n01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.160\nYes.\n\n01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.160\nNot bad.\n\n01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.160\nNot bad at all.\n\n01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:15.160\nBut you also deal, ah, that's up.\n\n01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.160\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.160\n10 damage.\n\n01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:20.160\nIt's like almost all the damage amounts have been 10 and 11 and it's weird.\n\n01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.160\nIs that low or high?\n\n01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.160\nIt's pretty solid, but it's just weird.\n\n01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.160\nIt's like, I don't know, maybe rolling 7s, you know?\n\n01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160\nOkay.\n\n01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.160\n2, 6s.\n\n01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.160\nWe should go to Vegas.\n\n01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.160\nYeah, let's do it.\n\n01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160\nSeriously.\n\n01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.160\nSpencer?\n\n01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.160\nMe and you.\n\n01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.160\nYeah.\n\n01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.160\nLet's get this fucking MGM, let's get this fucking on.\n\n01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.160\nYou know, I've never been to Vegas.\n\n01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.160\nWe should go together.\n\n01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.160\nI've never been either.\n\n01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.160\nLet's all go.\n\n01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.160\nI don't want to go with you guys.\n\n01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.160\nAlright.\n\n01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:50.160\nThe city may never sleep, but I go to bed at night.\n\n01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:56.160\nSpencer and Jeff in Vegas is a movie I will wait to rent.\n\n01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:01.160\nVegas Jam.\n\n01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:07.160\nLet's go to Vegas when Pearl Jam is playing next.\n\n01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.160\nAnd bring Michael Jordan.\n\n01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:16.160\nOh, the buffet is open from 3 p.m. and I'm lover.\n\n01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:21.160\nHave you seen the movie where it's the guy who goes off into the woods on his own and\n\n01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.160\nbasically dies?\n\n01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.160\nInto the woods.\n\n01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.160\nWhat's it called?\n\n01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.160\nGrizzly Man.\n\n01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.160\nNot Grizzly Man.\n\n01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.160\nInto the wild.\n\n01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.160\nInto the wild.\n\n01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.160\nBecause it's this guy living on his own alone.\n\n01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.160\nAnd it's literally Eddie Vedder narrating what he's doing.\n\n01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:39.160\nSo he's literally Eddie Vedder like, today he made a shower.\n\n01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.160\nIt's fucking awful anyway.\n\n01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.160\nDon't you know that's a true story?\n\n01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.160\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.160\nWell, that guy's an idiot.\n\n01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.160\nHe genuinely is anyway.\n\n01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.160\nHe was.\n\n01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.160\nWe can jibber jabber all we want, but we have a dragon in the room.\n\n01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.160\nSidebar.\n\n01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.160\nHow many monsters can I summon at one time?\n\n01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:01.160\nTwo scorpions on the Scorp Deck.\n\n01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:04.160\nYeah, you know, I think you can summon however many.\n\n01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:08.160\nBut yeah, I mean, yeah, you can only do one order though.\n\n01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:13.160\nSo you have the standing orders to attack, but if you had four monsters, you couldn't\n\n01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.160\nbe like, you attack.\n\n01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.160\nNo, no, no, I don't want to do different shit.\n\n01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.160\nI'm just saying, that's okay.\n\n01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:21.160\nIf I could keep summoning more scorpions every turn and having all those scorpions understand.\n\n01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.160\nWell, eventually you're going to run out of spells.\n\n01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160\nI think you got two more level two summons.\n\n01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:29.160\nIt's impossible for me to cast Ray of Frost and for one of us to shatter him like with\n\n01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.160\na sword attack and like take off a leg.\n\n01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:35.160\nIf it froze him, yeah, but I mean it's not very much damage.\n\n01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:40.160\nCan you call the next ones Dennis and Haysbert?\n\n01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.160\nI'm going to let Keith and David do their thing.\n\n01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.160\nI'm going to spend this turn trying to do something a little more.\n\n01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:48.160\nNo, no, no, I don't mean I'm passing.\n\n01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.160\nI know.\n\n01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.160\nI'm rolling Keith and David.\n\n01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.160\nYou roll.\n\n01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.160\nThey're attacking, you know, like you had ordered.\n\n01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:59.160\nI want to know about Tasha's hideous laugh again.\n\n01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.160\nYeah, so that's a spell.\n\n01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.160\nThat's a charm spell that if they fail, they will save.\n\n01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:10.160\nYou know, they lose their action because they're doubled over.\n\n01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.160\nMight it work on a large reptile?\n\n01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:19.160\nI mean, dragons in general are pretty hard to charm, but yeah, it would if you rolled poorly.\n\n01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:27.160\nTasha's hideous laughter.\n\n01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.160\nWhat's he doing?\n\n01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.160\nI think he's taking leprechaun in the hood.\n\n01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.160\nYeah.\n\n01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:37.160\nOh, he don't play that.\n\n01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.160\nPot of gold.\n\n01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.160\nYou guys hang out with this guy like all the time?\n\n01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:48.160\nYou say as you're staring at a dragon stick.\n\n01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.160\nWhat a weirdo.\n\n01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:52.160\nAnyway, I'm going to continue stabbing this dick.\n\n01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.160\nHe does.\n\n01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.160\nHe does pass his will save, so he's unaffected.\n\n01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.160\nAll right.\n\n01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.160\nWell, Keith, David.\n\n01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.160\nDid that do anything?\n\n01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.160\nThe singing?\n\n01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.160\nNo.\n\n01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.160\nBut it was worth a shot.\n\n01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.160\nLet my scorpions do their thing.\n\n01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.160\nThe scorpions attack.\n\n01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.160\nDavid doesn't manage to strike the high.\n\n01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.160\nHowever.\n\n01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.160\nWhy is this happening?\n\n01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:23.160\nHowever, Keith deals a wicked blow to the back left leg of the dragon, dealing eight damage.\n\n01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.160\nThat's not bad.\n\n01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:28.160\nYou basically chipped its nail.\n\n01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.160\nSo right now the dragon has a numb dick, right?\n\n01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:32.160\nYeah.\n\n01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.160\nHow big is the dick?\n\n01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:35.160\nHow big is the dick?\n\n01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.160\nHow big is the dragon's dick?\n\n01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.160\nHow big is your dick?\n\n01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.160\nIs your dick is so big?\n\n01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:42.160\nI really need to know.\n\n01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.160\nI'm really, I'm really crunching.\n\n01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.160\nI'm living in a world.\n\n01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.160\nI'm taking this as seriously as you are now.\n\n01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.160\nBreaking me down.\n\n01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.160\nHuh?\n\n01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.160\nIs it bigger than a bread box?\n\n01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.160\nYeah.\n\n01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.160\nIs it numb?\n\n01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160\nI'm small.\n\n01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.160\nCan I crawl up inside his dick hole?\n\n01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.160\nWhat?\n\n01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.160\nJeff.\n\n01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.160\nI can kill him on the inside.\n\n01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.160\nWhat?\n\n01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.160\nI'll take my sword.\n\n01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.160\nI'll climb up his dick.\n\n01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.160\nIt's numb.\n\n01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.160\nHe won't know.\n\n01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.160\nCan I?\n\n01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.160\nCan I squeeze into the dick hole and get inside his abdomen?\n\n01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.160\nI'll just smash it and fucking.\n\n01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.160\nAnd I'm like, I should have thought of that.\n\n01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.160\nThis is how I fight.\n\n01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.160\nIs it too small for me to climb inside?\n\n01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.160\nYeah.\n\n01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.160\nIt's like, I mean, maybe the size of an elephant.\n\n01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:26.160\nLike, he can't climb up an elephant's dick.\n\n01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.160\nYeah.\n\n01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.160\nLike, maybe it's asshole.\n\n01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:32.160\nWhat if I go up to his dick and I hold it open and I have Mulrainee come behind him.\n\n01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.160\nI have her shoot arrows into his dick hole.\n\n01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.160\nWhat?\n\n01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.160\nI'm just trying to kill a dragon.\n\n01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.160\nThat would be exceedingly dangerous.\n\n01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.160\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.160\nRight.\n\n01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160\nMaybe.\n\n01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.160\nMaybe?\n\n01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.160\nI mean, technically, it's possible to hold open something.\n\n01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.160\nOkay.\n\n01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.160\nBecause I have fast movement.\n\n01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.160\nI say, Psst, Mulrainee.\n\n01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.160\nI'm going to run up using my fast, sneaky dwarf.\n\n01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.160\nLet me run this by you, Mulrainee.\n\n01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.160\nMy gnome.\n\n01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.160\nThis is a tough sell.\n\n01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:57.160\nYeah.\n\n01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.160\nYou don't have to do it.\n\n01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.160\nI'm taking all the risk here.\n\n01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:02.160\nI want you just to get two of your favorite arrows handy.\n\n01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.160\nAnd I'm going to run up real quick, grab his numb dick, open it up, and I'm going to aim\n\n01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.160\nit towards you.\n\n01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.160\nAnd I want you to shoot as many arrows as you can into his dick hole.\n\n01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.160\nAm I still hanging out by the dick?\n\n01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.160\nBe careful.\n\n01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.160\nDon't hit me.\n\n01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.160\nHit the dick.\n\n01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:21.160\nI'll agree to this if only we can talk about what this means after.\n\n01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.160\nI'm trying to kill a dragon.\n\n01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.160\nI can discuss it.\n\n01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.160\nThat's trying to make sense to me.\n\n01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.160\nAll we've done so far is numb this guy's dick.\n\n01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:30.160\nI'm taking advantage of a breach in the armor right now.\n\n01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:33.160\nAll we've done, all I've done.\n\n01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.160\nYou've been trying to climb a statue.\n\n01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:39.160\nI'm trying to stand on the shoulders of your hard work.\n\n01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.160\nDude, we're all on the same team.\n\n01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:46.160\nAll I'm saying is that I quirk and Chris, we should examine this a little bit more afterwards.\n\n01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.160\nAnd an impetuous gnome barbarian in the state of mind.\n\n01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.160\nI run up.\n\n01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.160\nI say, just do what you want to do.\n\n01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.160\nI'm going to go open that dick hole.\n\n01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.160\nAnd I run up.\n\n01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:00.160\nAnd I grab the dragon's numb dick and I open it up and I aim it at her like a fire hose.\n\n01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.160\nAnd I go, shoot your arrows!\n\n01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.160\nWhy would arrows open it up?\n\n01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.160\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.160\nHe opens it up.\n\n01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.160\nI need my hands to open it up.\n\n01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.160\nI'm giving her a target size.\n\n01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.160\nThe gesture you're making is very flattering to the dragon.\n\n01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.160\nI don't know how big a dragon's dick is.\n\n01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.160\nI bet it's not as big as, I mean, that's like a post office box.\n\n01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.160\nWhat a weird, my dick looks weird.\n\n01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.160\nI'm opening it up to a mailbox size.\n\n01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.160\nThe size of a mailbox.\n\n01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.160\nCan you hit a mailbox?\n\n01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.160\nHey, what's up, dude?\n\n01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.160\nI'm right next to the dick still.\n\n01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.160\nHey, what are you doing?\n\n01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.160\nChris, step a little over to the side.\n\n01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.160\nOkay.\n\n01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.160\nYeah, this is a bad place to be right now.\n\n01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:40.160\nAre you opening the dick hole to get arrows in?\n\n01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.160\nYes.\n\n01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.160\nOh, you're going for the number three?\n\n01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.160\nYeah.\n\n01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.160\nSo I'm standing there holding a dragon's dick open.\n\n01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.160\nOkay.\n\n01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:54.160\nI bet you've never said that sentence before.\n\n01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.160\nSo before that quite happens, the dragon attacks.\n\n01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:04.160\nYou told me his dick was numb, DeBurg.\n\n01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:07.160\nYeah, he did his own attacking with his dick.\n\n01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.160\nHe has.\n\n01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.160\nI was trying to, I didn't want to get into a big conversation.\n\n01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.160\nI wanted to use my fast move and open the dick, get an arrow in there and run the fuck over.\n\n01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:22.160\nI think we're all safe here, convened around his dick, because God knows if a dragon could attack us here, he wouldn't leave the house.\n\n01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:29.160\nHey, oh, judging snap.\n\n01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.160\nWait, so who does he attack?\n\n01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.160\nProbably me.\n\n01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:37.160\nWell, he attacks Keith, you know, and he, oh good.\n\n01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.160\nYeah, that's fine.\n\n01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.160\nLet me just narrate this.\n\n01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.160\nWe're okay with that.\n\n01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:50.160\nRearing back and striking with his front claw, he pins down the scorpion before biting its head with his fearsome beak, ripping it from its shoulders.\n\n01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:52.160\nDo scorpions have shoulders?\n\n01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.160\nYes.\n\n01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.160\nRipping it from its shoulders.\n\n01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.160\nIt got like eight.\n\n01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.160\nYeah, they got a bunch of shoulders.\n\n01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.160\nAt the same time.\n\n01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.160\nIts survival instinct is terrible, by the way.\n\n01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:02.160\nHe's not going for the guy opening his dick.\n\n01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:05.160\nChronologically, that hasn't happened yet.\n\n01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.160\nOh, shit.\n\n01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.160\nAt least he had to happen.\n\n01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:17.160\nWith both of his wings, he flails them wildly and his left wing catches Christopher right in the chin, knocking you off your feet onto your back.\n\n01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:21.160\nOh, my mouth is my fortune.\n\n01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:26.160\nKeith!\n\n01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.160\nBut now, this is the perfect time.\n\n01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.160\nChristopher is now cleared out of the way.\n\n01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.160\nHe's distracted with scorpion shoulders.\n\n01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:42.160\nSo now I've run up, opened up his dick hole, and cried out to Mulraine to shoot some arrows into this dragon's dick for Pete's sake.\n\n01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:48.160\nApproaching the dragon, he points his beak at you and then does something like a pack attack.\n\n01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:56.160\nHow about, you know, rearing back like a cobra, he lunges forward, striking you directly in the chest with his beak.\n\n01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:05.160\nIt pings harmlessly off your armor, and you manage to position yourself right under his, you know, dickle regions.\n\n01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.160\nI think the dickle regions are just called dick.\n\n01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:16.160\nPositioning yourself strategically around the dick, you force your hands into the opening, whiting the urethra.\n\n01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:23.160\nYou call out to your compatriot, Mulraine, who is somewhat conflicted by this whole thing, it seems.\n\n01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:24.160\nIt's fine, it's fine.\n\n01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:26.160\nOkay, well, that's just what I'm reading off your face.\n\n01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:28.160\nCan I ask, how much did that get hurt?\n\n01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:31.160\nYou got hurt for, what did I, I said five damage, right?\n\n01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.160\nFour damage.\n\n01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:36.160\nI mean, I'm just, I'm guessing, well, no, remember, I was going to say the dumbest thing in the world.\n\n01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:39.160\nI just, I can't help but just picture a giant penis.\n\n01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:42.160\nI was about to say I've had more experience with penises than you guys have, that's retarded.\n\n01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.160\nYou all have penises.\n\n01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.160\nI experience one every day.\n\n01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.160\nRight.\n\n01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:52.160\nHow much experience do you have with my retarded sister?\n\n01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.160\nAll

01:32:55.160\nI'm very sorry I said retarded.\n\n01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:58.160\nIn my mind, I pictured this whole thing to go down a lot faster.\n\n01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:03.160\nYou know, I would
