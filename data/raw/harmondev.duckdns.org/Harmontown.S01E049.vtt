00:00.000 --> 00:20.560
Hello everybody, welcome to Meltdown in Hollywood, California.

00:20.560 --> 00:38.680
Welcome to the stage of the mayor of Hymen Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:38.680 --> 00:42.840
Happy St. Patrick's Day aftermath, right?

00:42.840 --> 00:43.840
You're a little hungover, Jeff?

00:43.840 --> 00:47.040
Yeah, I got pretty drunk last night.

00:47.040 --> 00:52.480
I spent the entire day on the couch eating, overeating, and watching David Attenborough

00:52.480 --> 00:55.480
animal documentaries.

00:55.480 --> 01:00.160
Aaron and I coincidentally have been watching a lot of the John Hurt, what's it, Human

01:00.160 --> 01:01.160
Planet?

01:01.160 --> 01:06.080
It's one of the John Hurt narrates, I think, in the beginning of the title sequence.

01:06.080 --> 01:13.160
He goes, there's only one animal that makes total use of the whole planet and does whatever

01:13.160 --> 01:14.160
it wants.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.160
Something like that.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.160
That's not really...

01:16.160 --> 01:18.920
It's better written than that.

01:18.920 --> 01:24.160
But I always, at the end of it, I compulsively have to go, me, John Hurt.

01:24.160 --> 01:29.600
Just thought I'd share that with you.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.600
It's kind of a...

01:30.600 --> 01:36.760
It's interesting, I thought I knew mostly everything about why I should be proud of

01:36.760 --> 01:41.880
people and being one of them, because usually you're being told by the television to be

01:41.880 --> 01:46.000
ashamed of being human, and there's a lot of reasons to be ashamed if you want to dwell

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
on that.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.160
For instance, we rape people.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.400
We murder each other.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.920
We are destroying the whole thing, whatever.

01:55.920 --> 02:00.640
We're doing all kinds of terrible things to ourselves and each other, and I always find

02:00.640 --> 02:07.440
it ironic and heroic to try to focus on, yeah, but kind of a cool, awkward monkey species

02:07.440 --> 02:15.600
that sort of rose to prominence, and there's an underdog story there.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.600
I thought I had...

02:16.600 --> 02:17.600
A long time ago.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.600
I thought I kind of...

02:18.600 --> 02:23.560
Well, no, not really, not at all, not in the timescale that matters, not if you're telling

02:23.560 --> 02:30.640
that story, if you're telling a story about species, we are in the opening of the third

02:30.640 --> 02:32.360
act of the Bad News Bears.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.520
We're not even...

02:33.520 --> 02:34.520
It's not...

02:34.520 --> 02:39.480
But the Bad News Bears lose that game.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.480
I never saw it, I don't know.

02:42.480 --> 02:50.000
But we're watching this John Hurt thing, Human Planet.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.480
These guys, I'm assuming it's in Africa, I think that's where lions are.

02:59.480 --> 03:05.800
They get food by waiting for lions to attack, like an animal, like a gazelle or something,

03:05.800 --> 03:11.080
and then they have this technique, like John Hurt teased it up and goes, they've got an

03:11.080 --> 03:16.040
interesting technique, but first they have to wait for the lion to make its kill.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.360
And I'm like, okay, what is there going to be some weird thing, like a fishing pole and

03:19.360 --> 03:22.120
then like a $20 bill on the end of a line?

03:22.120 --> 03:23.960
It's not Vincent Price narrating that?

03:23.960 --> 03:28.080
No, no, it's not, it's not Hurt.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.840
And I don't do an impression of either of them, so I can understand your confusion.

03:31.840 --> 03:36.000
Oh, these are the guys that just sneak up and just scare the lions off.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
No, they don't...

03:37.000 --> 03:45.080
Okay, I want to stress that they don't sneak up, the whole thing is they just roll up.

03:45.080 --> 03:50.880
They just kind of walk up like they're going to get a paper.

03:50.880 --> 03:55.640
And then part of the gimmick of this show is that all these people that you're visiting

03:55.640 --> 03:58.000
around all the corners of the earth, they all have their own language, you don't know

03:58.000 --> 04:02.160
what the hell they're saying, that these subtitles, they're modern subtitles because

04:02.160 --> 04:06.480
they kind of float in their key frames a little bit, they float a little bit, they float a

04:06.480 --> 04:08.840
few pixels to the right as the people are saying them.

04:08.840 --> 04:15.000
But the weird thing is, none of the people, like if these subtitles are actual translations,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.200
America is the only place that has any linguistic nuance at all.

04:19.200 --> 04:24.320
Everyone, everywhere else, if there's a guy climbing a tree to get to honey, he only ever

04:24.320 --> 04:31.800
says like, I found bees up here with honey, there's lots of honey in here.

04:31.800 --> 04:36.360
That's what he would say to his friends after 20 years of doing this, he doesn't have any

04:36.360 --> 04:37.360
fucking lingo.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.360
Yeah.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.360
We did it again, hot chat.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.360
Yeah.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.360
Come on, baby.

04:42.360 --> 04:46.240
Yeah, daddy needs to do a pair of shoes.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.720
We should be asking ourselves when we see the subtitles, what the fuck's going on?

04:49.720 --> 04:52.320
Even though it's translated into English, it's still like, oh, I get it, he's been doing

04:52.320 --> 04:53.320
this for a while.

04:53.320 --> 04:57.760
But everyone just keeps going, there's the lions, now we make our move.

04:57.760 --> 05:02.840
And these guys, two guys, they just stand up out of the bushes, and there's 20 lions.

05:02.840 --> 05:06.920
And they're like, damn, they have blood on their faces, because they're just mushing

05:06.920 --> 05:10.600
their faces into dead gazelle and just eating them.

05:10.600 --> 05:14.480
Some of them have manes, and the other ones don't.

05:14.480 --> 05:19.040
I think there's some significance there among them, but the point is like, picture any kind

05:19.040 --> 05:23.240
of lion, picture anything, these aren't scrawny lions, these are like zoo lions, these are

05:23.240 --> 05:30.040
big fat fucking scary giant lions, like the kind you would get a wax sculpture of out

05:30.040 --> 05:32.320
of a machine.

05:32.320 --> 05:36.360
And there's 15 of them, 15 of them.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.560
What machine dispenses waxed lions?

05:39.560 --> 05:41.080
That's not a universal thing?

05:41.080 --> 05:42.080
No.

05:42.080 --> 05:46.240
Oh, okay, well, the Milwaukee County Zoo had these machines.

05:46.240 --> 05:50.600
I assumed there was a regular thing, I'm sorry.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.320
Go to the Milwaukee County Zoo, it's actually...

05:52.320 --> 05:54.760
The machine makes a waxed lion?

05:54.760 --> 05:59.480
They have a machine, they used to anyway, at the Milwaukee County Zoo, there was a machine

05:59.480 --> 06:06.000
almost every exhibit almost, like every kind of category, like there was a penguin and there

06:06.000 --> 06:11.520
was a lion, there was a giraffe, like if you went there, they kind of draw you in and put

06:11.520 --> 06:17.360
a quarter in or a dollar, I'm sure it inflated, but when I was a kid, it was a machine that

06:17.360 --> 06:22.160
would, really none of what I'm about to tell you is going to make a lot of sense to modern

06:22.160 --> 06:29.120
ears, but this was before the internet, and also before I hit puberty, so it made sense

06:29.120 --> 06:34.400
to me, there was a big machine, and you put coins in it, and it was kind of transparent

06:34.400 --> 06:38.400
what it was doing, and a lot of tubes and metal things in it, and you would put enough

06:38.400 --> 06:44.080
coins in it and it would go, and these metal things would come together, and then like

06:44.080 --> 06:58.320
colored wax would, plastic would go through these tubes into this thing, and it would

06:58.320 --> 07:05.880
drop a hot, dangerous, melted plastic lion into a tray that the machine very specifically

07:05.880 --> 07:11.400
told you, a la McDonald's giving you an apple pie, like your fault if you, somebody in the

07:11.400 --> 07:17.320
front row is holding it, it gave me a picture of one that he got, he googled, try to enjoy

07:17.320 --> 07:23.400
the show, stop googling, so it's an injection molding machine that makes you a lion, or

07:23.400 --> 07:32.160
it's a hot plastic injection, as Judd Nelson would say, do you want to get a hot plastic

07:32.160 --> 07:33.160
injection later on?

07:33.160 --> 07:42.520
Did he give you the hot plastic injection, leave me alone, see this is what you get when

07:42.520 --> 07:50.520
you spill paint in the garage, your dad molds a plastic giraffe on you, it very specifically

07:50.520 --> 07:54.320
tells you how you're allowed to hold it, because there's holes in the bottom of it, and that's

07:54.320 --> 07:59.640
where the plastic goes, like that's the umbilical point for the mother plastic machine, and if

07:59.640 --> 08:07.560
you hold it the wrong way, ostensibly melting molten plastic would drip on your child hands,

08:07.560 --> 08:15.120
rendering them forever claw like, you would become like this weird self-loathing phantom

08:15.120 --> 08:22.600
of the zoo, the feeding goats out of your weird useless flipper, come here, come here,

08:22.600 --> 08:26.880
I'm here because I have to be, I once came because I loved it, now I have nowhere else

08:26.880 --> 08:34.480
to go, no woman will touch me in the parking lot, I turned into Peter Lorre, I took on

08:34.480 --> 08:41.040
a weird accent that can't be traced, it can't be traced, Rick, Steepie, Steepie, Steepie,

08:41.040 --> 08:48.920
where am I from Steepie, um, anyways, tonight's going to be a tangent free night, I don't

08:48.920 --> 08:55.160
want to get off on anything, tonight's show is called Focus, so when I tell you there

08:55.160 --> 09:02.160
were 20 lions burrowing their faces into this killout, because I used that handy reference

09:02.160 --> 09:12.000
to that plastic molding machine, you guys know exactly what I mean by 20 lions, I completely

09:12.000 --> 09:17.560
forgotten what you were talking about, but imagine this too, here's the thing about lions

09:17.560 --> 09:26.000
in the wild, you know, they're kind of getting no pun intended, I guess pun intended, but

09:26.000 --> 09:36.800
also no pun celebrated, they're getting catty with each other, they're eating the gazelle,

09:36.800 --> 09:43.960
I said not celebrated, lady, I couldn't have put a bigger disclaimer on that, I connected

09:43.960 --> 09:47.920
the dots, I proceeded as usual, I did everything I needed to do, I got in the airlock, I took

09:47.920 --> 09:56.600
a deep breath, I told everyone what was happening, I said catty, some lady, it's a pun, I know

09:56.600 --> 10:03.520
it's an accident, I'm not going to censor myself, so these lions like they're eating

10:03.520 --> 10:10.000
and they're in a mode, they're at a point in their day and their lives where even another

10:10.000 --> 10:18.000
lion is pissing them off, they're like this is a good femur muscle, someone's like is

10:18.000 --> 10:22.040
the muscle good, you want to try some of the spleen, and it's like I know you're just saying

10:22.040 --> 10:25.920
that because you're going to want the femur muscle, I don't know, I don't want the spleen,

10:25.920 --> 10:29.560
if I wanted the spleen I wouldn't have started eating the femur muscle, you know what I

10:29.560 --> 10:30.560
mean?

10:30.560 --> 10:37.600
Is that only my pet peeve when you go to eat with your girlfriend, she's like how is the

10:37.600 --> 10:42.440
duck, and you're like the duck's fine, and I just did my head, I just see the chess

10:42.440 --> 10:50.400
game, you want to try the duck, and you don't bite on it because you come from a family

10:50.400 --> 10:57.720
of four people that guarded their food, so then they go, God this chicken, you want to

10:57.720 --> 10:58.720
try some of the chicken?

10:58.720 --> 11:03.640
No I don't want to try the chicken, I know it's a fucking setup, you want to get into

11:03.640 --> 11:12.720
a food exchange where the net result is you get my duck, but I ordered right, I win dinner.

11:12.720 --> 11:16.520
So when you take your losses, eat your chicken.

11:16.520 --> 11:21.760
When you watch a documentary about lions over a carcass, you connect the dots to you having

11:21.760 --> 11:22.760
dinner with your girlfriend?

11:22.760 --> 11:28.280
No, I just connected those dots now, what I'm telling you is that well in order to explain

11:28.280 --> 11:35.400
to you what the state of affairs of these lions grazing over this gazelle, they're

11:35.400 --> 11:39.760
not being polite, they're not lulled into a state of graciousness.

11:39.760 --> 11:45.360
These are lions at the height of their lioness, they're like so mad that another lion could

11:45.360 --> 11:50.920
bite, they're like going, I'm eating, I'm eating, I'm eating.

11:50.920 --> 11:58.680
So into that frame, marches these two fucking idiots with blankets for shirts, they got

11:58.680 --> 12:05.720
nothing, they don't have special lion guns or rocks that they know make a lion choke.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.760
They have sticks and what they have is eye contact and they just start walking up.

12:08.760 --> 12:15.480
Just a gate, just a G-A-I-T gate, they just stand up for the bush and they don't make

12:15.480 --> 12:21.160
a sound, they don't go like, hey lion lion lion lion, they don't go whoop whoop whoop

12:21.160 --> 12:25.600
whoop whoop whoop, nothing like that, they just silently walk up like, well they used

12:25.600 --> 12:29.200
to carry a G-A-T-E gate and just make it seem like they were separated by us.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.520
Yeah, they just slowly pretend like they lived there, oh another piece of junk mail, oh,

12:32.520 --> 12:38.360
hey what are you guys doing in my front yard?

12:38.360 --> 12:45.240
They slowly change their address by one digit, no, they walk, and the fucking 15

12:45.240 --> 12:50.120
lions, they bone out, they all go like, these guys mean business.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.920
And these guys quickly carve off and then John Hurt goes like, they have to work quickly

12:53.920 --> 13:03.960
because the lions will catch onto their bluff, hey wait a minute, those are upright walking

13:03.960 --> 13:09.920
priming, that's more food that just stole our food, you know that you're hungry when

13:09.920 --> 13:13.320
you're chasing lions off a kill, like you have to be starving.

13:13.320 --> 13:17.680
And then they sling it over their shoulder, like they're walking out of a deli, like a

13:17.680 --> 13:24.040
bad deli, because a good deli would give you a bag, but this is Africa, like they just

13:24.040 --> 13:27.840
went Christmas tree shopping, they sling it up like, yeah, I think they don't run off,

13:27.840 --> 13:33.640
they just cruise out like, just walk away, just walk away, and then they're like around

13:33.640 --> 13:39.640
a campfire and then the subtitles say like, we got lucky with those lions today, they

13:39.640 --> 13:43.240
didn't know they could have eaten us, that could have gone totally bad.

13:43.240 --> 13:49.200
And they'll do it again next Wednesday, but I'm just very impressed with human beings.

13:49.200 --> 13:56.440
Then there's another one where there's like these, god damn it, what is it, it's, hey

13:56.440 --> 14:03.000
Aaron, what is it, was it pigeons or something in the trees, what's the thing in, there's

14:03.000 --> 14:09.240
those birds that, I don't want to spoil the ending, you know what I'm talking about?

14:09.240 --> 14:13.480
Yeah, yeah, okay, there's like these locust like birds, they're basically like the avian

14:13.480 --> 14:18.160
equivalent of locusts when they eat everything, so again, it's just these guys that just hang

14:18.160 --> 14:22.920
out and they're like, but now these are birds that'll eat their crops, so like, but the

14:22.920 --> 14:27.960
humans have developed a different solution to their bird problem, at the end of the night

14:27.960 --> 14:34.800
the birds must go home to their nests, where the humans have prepared a rather clever trick

14:34.800 --> 14:40.680
that they just show them like unspooling, well it looks like cable, I'm like wait, this

14:40.680 --> 14:45.560
isn't, they're not spearing dung on their heads, and like, this isn't a symbiotic relationship,

14:45.560 --> 14:50.800
those look like canisters of gasoline, and then they just show like A-teaming, like he's

14:50.800 --> 14:54.720
bringing these cheese, and then it's like a joke, it's like a British sitcom or something,

14:54.720 --> 15:00.200
like the birds all fly to the nest, so then it cuts to a wide shot, and they go, brrrr,

15:00.200 --> 15:06.560
the entire forest explodes, and then they move on to the next subject, on the shores

15:06.560 --> 15:13.040
of Scotland, humans love to ride segues, it doesn't, there's no, he doesn't comment

15:13.040 --> 15:19.320
on it, it's nothing like, human beings, ah, that plucky species, those birds are getting

15:19.320 --> 15:26.240
out of hand, it just blew up the forest, they'll have to do it again next Wednesday, very interesting

15:26.240 --> 15:29.880
species, and I don't think, I think it's important to embrace it and say, you know what, you're

15:29.880 --> 15:35.120
alright, humanity, you're alright, um, if you could be another animal, like in terms

15:35.120 --> 15:41.520
of, like, I would kill myself, I would be a suicidal porpoise, I would purposely go

15:41.520 --> 15:48.960
out of my way to find the places where people dispose of those six-pack rings, and not cut

15:48.960 --> 15:54.240
them responsibly, so I could hang myself, could you have a choice, are you a predator,

15:54.240 --> 15:59.920
a scavenger, a victim, herbivore, carnivore, I would, I mean, can I be an autotrofe, can

15:59.920 --> 16:07.440
I be a photosynthetic, kind of, just, like, mushroom, no, animal, animal, well, no, it

16:07.440 --> 16:13.680
could be an insect, bird, alright, alright, alright, okay, I think I would, boy, oh boy,

16:13.680 --> 16:16.880
I mean, there's, there's hundreds of species in the world, you know it seems like they

16:16.880 --> 16:24.880
got it right, 20 of them, undiscovered, manatees, manatees, they cruise around, they graze

16:24.880 --> 16:29.240
on grass, and nobody eats them, because they're too big and fat, and no one fucks with a manatee,

16:29.240 --> 16:32.080
they just, like, cruise around, yeah, well there is stuff like that, like, at the top

16:32.080 --> 16:35.520
of the food chain, that's nice, like, they're herbivores, they're vegetarians, and nobody

16:35.520 --> 16:40.960
eats them, because they're giant, fat people, yeah, and they, why are you raising your

16:40.960 --> 16:49.480
hand, this is GS, you got one? Yeah, they get hit by propellers, oh yeah, yeah, okay,

16:49.480 --> 16:55.600
well, that's true, I mean, everyone, I think, I think the assumption is that you wouldn't

16:55.600 --> 16:59.480
have a manatee brain, right, you would, you would be like, you would be like Albert Brooks

16:59.480 --> 17:06.320
as a manatee, going like, oh boy, yeah, this is neurotic about this, like, I would assume

17:06.320 --> 17:09.280
that you'd see a propeller and go, I don't want none of that, I wouldn't choose to be

17:09.280 --> 17:13.880
a neurotic manatee, I would choose, I'm just saying, I'd be Alec Baldwin as a manatee,

17:13.880 --> 17:18.480
you'd have a voiceover, you'd have a celebrity voiceover, you'd have an intelligent manatee

17:18.480 --> 17:22.600
that had, like, a kind of a dialogue with the audience, you'd be like, I'd be a Bruce

17:22.600 --> 17:29.600
Willis manatee, I'd be like, you know, all things considered, I'd rather be Philadelphia,

17:29.600 --> 17:41.680
than those estuaries, yeah, oh boy, look, a propeller for me, fool me twice, come to

17:41.680 --> 17:53.840
Miami, hang out in the channel, I would be, I would be, or you could be a Liam Neeson

17:53.840 --> 18:02.080
manatee, sorry, no, I didn't mean to set myself up with one of my well-known impressions,

18:02.080 --> 18:10.760
all right, wait, okay, let me get out my phone, let's start bringing people up, oh, I want

18:10.760 --> 18:19.880
to, you know what, quick, listen to Duncan Trestle's podcast, I like to think that most

18:19.880 --> 18:24.360
of our audience is kind of overlapping, because I think if you like the meal you get here,

18:24.360 --> 18:30.040
it's pretty tasty over there as well, and vice versa, but I mean, right, if you haven't

18:30.040 --> 18:36.000
jumped aboard, like, right now, I feel like, this is hyperbolic, I'm not like a big podcast

18:36.000 --> 18:41.760
guy, but I feel like he must be making podcast history, that this is something that, his

18:41.760 --> 18:47.200
mom is dying, he just recovered from testicular cancer, which is completely unrelated to him,

18:47.200 --> 18:53.960
that his mom, his mom is succumbing to breast cancer, I believe, and, but it's like, it's

18:53.960 --> 18:58.440
just incredible, like, I had to pull my car over to the side of the road, when he was

18:58.440 --> 19:04.240
just talking about it, he's in, I think he's in North Carolina, you know, getting her affairs

19:04.240 --> 19:07.800
in order and talking to her and stuff, and then that was, it was already enough just

19:07.800 --> 19:12.080
him talking about it, it was mind blowing, the way that this guy is able to cope with

19:12.080 --> 19:17.480
the fundamental things that cause us suffering, and the big, giant cosmic elephants in the

19:17.480 --> 19:21.920
cosmic room, like, he's, it's not like he's a man, he's not Caesar Milaning them, but

19:21.920 --> 19:26.640
he is able to, like, you're not supposed to, he knows that you're not supposed to, and

19:26.640 --> 19:30.720
he's just like, I don't know, the Elan, with which he talks about the stuff, and then on

19:30.720 --> 19:36.440
top of all that, just the most recently, now the most recent episode is, it's his mom,

19:36.440 --> 19:41.520
he's interviewing his mom, literally on her deathbed, there is no skirting around it,

19:41.520 --> 19:46.600
they're not, nor are they joking about it hilariously, it's not depressing, it's not,

19:46.600 --> 19:51.480
it's not fake uplifting, it's just honest and sincere and incredible, and, and there

19:51.480 --> 19:56.040
must be some kind of, because this is how I process things, there must be some kind

19:56.040 --> 20:02.080
of potty award, oh you mean like podcast, not potty like you take a poop when you're

20:02.080 --> 20:10.440
a baby, I want to reduce everything to, give him an award, that was great, that was a joke

20:10.440 --> 20:15.080
but, I guess you guys can see that I'm that petty, you said potty, which makes it sound

20:15.080 --> 20:18.440
like poopies, oh no, no, I don't think, no, they still, they still, no, they understand

20:18.440 --> 20:22.600
what I'm saying, they refuse to laugh at my joke, because of, they're like, Dan, a woman's

20:22.600 --> 20:26.760
dying, and I'm like, yeah, but I have a joke that I'm doing, and they're like, yeah, we

20:26.760 --> 20:31.840
get it, you're not entitled to a laugh from us, and I'm like, we visited a friend of ours

20:31.840 --> 20:34.800
that was in a hospital for maybe trumped up reasons and nothing was wrong with them,

20:34.800 --> 20:39.600
but you, you were very ill at ease in there, we were in their ER, oh, yeah, well, I don't

20:39.600 --> 20:43.880
like hospitals for sure, yeah, I mean, nobody does, but you were, you looked really like,

20:43.880 --> 20:49.640
like, really freaked out, well, I mean, here's the thing, I don't make a lot of eye contact

20:49.640 --> 20:56.880
in general, an emergency room is a three foot like closet, so if you're not making eye contact

20:56.880 --> 21:01.240
in an emergency room, it's like, you don't really have, it's kind of like, you can either

21:01.240 --> 21:05.400
stare at your friend in an emergency room bed, or you can do what you did, which is you showed

21:05.400 --> 21:09.880
up for five minutes, and then you went, I'm bored, and you left, which is fine, I also

21:09.880 --> 21:13.360
said, do you validate, which is how that hilarious, right, no, we all did lots of bits, and we

21:13.360 --> 21:19.800
had a great time, like, nobody, I mean, I'm going to use that forever now, every time

21:19.800 --> 21:23.320
I go into somebody, I'm going to say, I'm going to leave, do you validate, this is hilarious,

21:23.320 --> 21:26.080
we all took pictures and did bits about the environment and stuff, but yeah, I mean,

21:26.080 --> 21:31.040
it's like, like, sure, I'll own the fact that I don't, I don't like my friends in hospitals,

21:31.040 --> 21:34.320
and I don't like strangers in hospitals, I don't like hospitals, I guess this people

21:34.320 --> 21:37.760
like get light-headed, this people that get sick to their stomach, I'm more of a stomach

21:37.760 --> 21:43.160
kind, I get a little queasy when I see people hurt, I thought he wasn't, he was fine, but

21:43.160 --> 21:46.040
like, I've gone and visited friends that were like, you know, had been in car accidents

21:46.040 --> 21:53.760
and stuff, and I get really like, like I want to puke, alright, no, I, maybe I went, maybe

21:53.760 --> 22:00.080
I went to some sort of pukey award, he, he, he, he had, he had, you know what, let me

22:00.080 --> 22:08.440
do what they didn't do, hahaha, you know, there's basic human rights people have as

22:08.440 --> 22:12.320
performers, you know, if you, if you, if they go like this, for instance, when they bounce

22:12.320 --> 22:15.640
on their toes like Johnny Carson at the end of something, you could give them a chuckle,

22:15.640 --> 22:19.680
even if they don't think it's funny, I didn't know whether to, whether to marry it or drive

22:19.680 --> 22:26.280
it, and then you kind of do that, thank you, was that so hard? Jesus Christ, it's not,

22:26.280 --> 22:34.800
I'm not running for office, I'm just doing a show, it's all, it's all a joke, I don't

22:34.800 --> 22:41.640
know what I'm saying ever, but I do know what I'm watching, and sometimes what I'm

22:41.640 --> 22:47.640
watching are horror movies, and last, last week, we, we, he wasn't here, but he's here

22:47.640 --> 22:51.800
this week, and it's, he actually, it turns out he's, he's, he's currently in the process

22:51.800 --> 22:56.240
of retiring his horror movie a day blog, and we've, now it's more, actually more timely

22:56.240 --> 23:01.680
to bring him up, so God smiled upon us, uh, booking-wise, um, so, can we bring to the

23:01.680 --> 23:11.680
stage Brian W. Collins, is he here? Is he here? Maybe he's not here again. Oh, he's here,

23:11.680 --> 23:22.200
okay, here he is. Brian's, uh, here, you can grab one of those. Hello Brian. Hello. Hello

23:22.200 --> 23:28.160
room. Yeah, we can sit down like this, and, um, so you're, you're a long time Armenian,

23:28.160 --> 23:31.360
I mean, you, as far as I know, you've been here since, since long before we even started

23:31.360 --> 23:36.200
podcasting, I, but I don't know, or care, but, uh, I mean, we've talked to you often,

23:36.200 --> 23:40.440
and, and, and know you as a, as a friend, and that you have this blog, which I have never

23:40.440 --> 23:46.160
visited, but that I find endlessly fascinating, because, which is sure by our symptom of narcissism,

23:46.160 --> 23:49.440
like, where you're like, oh, my friend does this really interesting thing, and I'm just

23:49.440 --> 23:54.840
like, still though, I'm gonna read this Tumblr entry about myself one more time, and it's,

23:54.840 --> 23:59.360
and it's no wonder my brain is decaying, like, like, like, it's like, uh, eating, eating

23:59.360 --> 24:04.520
the lead paint of my own ego, and like, like, like, like, of course I'm gonna die of something.

24:04.520 --> 24:10.480
Uh, Brian, uh, tell us, tell us about your blog in a nutshell, and, and know that I'm

24:10.480 --> 24:11.480
a bad interviewer.

24:11.480 --> 24:17.480
All right, so, uh, yeah, um, just a little over six years ago, I started watching horror

24:17.480 --> 24:22.800
movies every day, and a couple weeks into it, I just decided to start writing reviews

24:22.800 --> 24:23.800
as well.

24:23.800 --> 24:24.800
That does it.

24:24.800 --> 24:25.800
That does it.

24:25.800 --> 24:26.800
Thank you.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.800
Good enough.

24:27.800 --> 24:32.960
Um, and, uh, you know, I, I, I started being like an editor, I never really wrote much,

24:32.960 --> 24:36.560
um, so I was just kind of figuring out how to write reviews every day.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.280
You watch a horror movie every day?

24:38.280 --> 24:39.280
Every day.

24:39.280 --> 24:40.280
For six years?

24:40.280 --> 24:41.280
Yeah.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.280
So what's six times 365?

24:42.280 --> 24:43.280
Anybody good at math?

24:43.280 --> 24:44.280
No, 1800.

24:44.280 --> 24:45.280
Is that right?

24:45.280 --> 24:50.560
Well, I mean, there are days where I watch more, you know, I go to festivals, and there's

24:50.560 --> 24:56.960
like four or something, so the 2,500 is the mark that I'm stopping at, which is, uh, March

24:56.960 --> 24:57.960
31st.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.560
So the first question is, how does that start?

25:00.560 --> 25:05.640
Like, like, like, like, at one point you noticed, you realized you were on a streak of watching

25:05.640 --> 25:06.640
one a day.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.640
Oh yeah, no.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.640
Uh, basically what happened was that I rented, you know, the discs from Netflix that all

25:10.640 --> 25:15.240
happened to be horror, and, uh, they were sitting on my, like, my couch for four months,

25:15.240 --> 25:18.080
and I was like looking, I'm like, wait, I could have just bought these three movies

25:18.080 --> 25:19.080
by now.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.080
There's a lot, there's 2007.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.080
They didn't have Netflix.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.080
Wait, what do you mean?

25:22.080 --> 25:23.080
You bought them as opposed to what?

25:23.080 --> 25:26.120
As opposed to paying for Netflix for three months for nothing, because this is before

25:26.120 --> 25:27.760
instant, so it's just the discs.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.760
Oh, oh, okay.

25:28.760 --> 25:31.920
Well, it's like, all right, four times, whatever, three, you know, Netflix thing, I'm like,

25:31.920 --> 25:32.920
I could have just bought these.

25:32.920 --> 25:35.640
Um, like, you know, and then I just started thinking about my day, I'm like, all right,

25:35.640 --> 25:38.880
you sleep for eight hours, you eat, you work for eight hours, it's eight hours of the day,

25:38.880 --> 25:41.520
I'm doing something, well, I can't, I just watch a horror movie.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.520
Right.

25:42.520 --> 25:43.520
Um, and so it started.

25:43.520 --> 25:48.240
So, and it, and it, now, were you single at the time when it, when it, no, actually,

25:48.240 --> 25:52.280
the only time I ever missed a day was like a week after I started.

25:52.280 --> 25:56.600
Uh, my wife and I took like a, uh, uh, it was our five year anniversary of dating, and

25:56.600 --> 26:02.320
we went down to, uh, to Long Beach for like a four day weekend, and I missed one day then.

26:02.320 --> 26:06.240
Yeah, the other three days, I still watch horror movies, but, so you've not missed,

26:06.240 --> 26:08.520
uh, you've only missed one day in six years.

26:08.520 --> 26:09.520
Yeah.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.520
Wow.

26:10.520 --> 26:13.280
And, uh, that's why I didn't come last week, because I was actually, I didn't watch the

26:13.280 --> 26:14.280
movie yet.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.280
Oh, really?

26:15.280 --> 26:16.280
Yeah.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.840
So, like, I got out of work and I was like, is it Martial Fear?

26:17.840 --> 26:18.840
Do you still enjoy it?

26:18.840 --> 26:20.840
Yeah, no, it's, it's part of the day now.

26:20.840 --> 26:25.400
So, I mean, I don't, it's not hard to like, I mean, every now and then things get busy,

26:25.400 --> 26:28.840
but, uh, so we can assume you've seen Leprechaun on the hood.

26:28.840 --> 26:31.400
Well, let's talk about that in a second.

26:31.400 --> 26:39.240
Uh, left on the hood, uh, up to no good, uh, up to do no good, uh, the, the, um, uh, so

26:39.240 --> 26:41.840
what, what, what do you think it is about the genre?

26:41.840 --> 26:43.400
Is it, is it like cheesecake?

26:43.400 --> 26:46.440
Is it like, like, like, like, like, is it a comfort food?

26:46.440 --> 26:53.800
Like the genre of horror, as opposed to sci-fi fantasy, as opposed to, uh, Tom Cruise thriller?

26:53.800 --> 26:57.880
Is it, is it, is it, what, what is, is there a factory must have thought about this sometime

26:57.880 --> 26:58.880
in six years?

26:58.880 --> 26:59.880
Well, Tom Cruise thriller day sucked.

26:59.880 --> 27:06.480
I mean, I'll ask you, um, no, uh, no, I've left horror since I was a little kid, um,

27:06.480 --> 27:08.600
you know, it wasn't like I just started watching horror that day.

27:08.600 --> 27:11.520
Like, you know, I've obviously been into it since I was like six or seven.

27:11.520 --> 27:13.560
So, why, why do we like horror movies?

27:13.560 --> 27:18.440
Uh, I think for me, I just found them, the more creative, because, you know, I always

27:18.440 --> 27:22.920
had friends that were into like doing special effects, makeup, um, and, you know, editing

27:22.920 --> 27:24.120
and stuff like that.

27:24.120 --> 27:28.160
So to me, like, you can really get away with more when you're doing horror, as opposed

27:28.160 --> 27:31.280
to like, like romantic comedies, where you kind of have to fit that formula.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.280
Right.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.280
Did they scare you?

27:33.280 --> 27:34.280
Are there any that?

27:34.280 --> 27:35.280
Not since I was a kid, no.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.280
Very rarely.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.780
There's not one that still gets you, gives you nightmares or anything like that?

27:37.780 --> 27:42.280
No, I mean, those, I watched, uh, I rewatched, like, two years ago, this TV movie that I

27:42.280 --> 27:44.000
saw when I was a kid called Don't Go to Sleep.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Does anybody know that one?

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Don't know.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Don't go to sleep.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.160
It was a TV horror, the back of like, when they did made for TV movies every week.

27:50.160 --> 27:54.600
Uh, it's about a little girl that gets possessed by the spirit of her older sister who had

27:54.600 --> 27:56.160
died in a car accident.

27:56.160 --> 28:00.120
And she blames the family, so she systematically wipes out the family.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.600
And there's this bit where, like, she's possessed and she has a pizza cutter and she's just

28:03.600 --> 28:07.040
like going up the stairs of this pizza cutter and like, she goes upstairs and kills her

28:07.040 --> 28:08.040
dad with it.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.040
And like, that freaked the shit out.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.040
I mean, I was like six or seven.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.040
There's always some image.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.040
Yeah.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.520
You're now afraid of pizza cutters.

28:13.520 --> 28:14.520
Oh yeah.

28:14.520 --> 28:17.640
Like, if I open the kitchen drawer, I see when I get scared.

28:17.640 --> 28:21.280
You would bring up romantic comedies as the obvious antithesis to the horror, which I

28:21.280 --> 28:27.160
think is accurate because sex, which is the ultimate creative act, you're procreating,

28:27.160 --> 28:31.080
you're creating life and death, which is, you know, I don't know if I finished this

28:31.080 --> 28:32.080
thought.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.560
Like, this is the battery that charges human life.

28:35.560 --> 28:39.680
Like, we're avoiding, we're afraid, we're all going to die, we know that we're going

28:39.680 --> 28:44.520
to die and we're also like driven to like make a life and live life.

28:44.520 --> 28:49.720
And so, and there probably is an equal volume of, actually, I bet horrors got it, got it,

28:49.720 --> 28:54.880
got it, like doubled or tripled, but, but like, you could watch a rom-com a day.

28:54.880 --> 28:55.880
You could try.

28:55.880 --> 28:58.800
Like, and you wouldn't necessarily end up having to loop back on yourself.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.760
I think they might make one a day.

29:01.760 --> 29:06.240
The big question is, why isn't that like a visceral like thing?

29:06.240 --> 29:11.320
And I think the answer has to do with the honesty level of a society that's like high

29:11.320 --> 29:12.320
on the hog.

29:12.320 --> 29:18.000
I think that, I think in a post Spielbergian box office world, you're, you, you're just

29:18.000 --> 29:21.480
not allowed to be as creative with love as you are with death.

29:21.480 --> 29:27.400
I think that we have decided that death, because we elude it daily and, and have kind of compartmentalized

29:27.400 --> 29:31.240
it, we can actually, you can put, have Clint Howard in your movie and, and, and have him

29:31.240 --> 29:34.640
stab someone in the head with an ice cream cone and, you know, like, like, and go, and

29:34.640 --> 29:36.640
go like, ah, what a fun way to kill that person.

29:36.640 --> 29:41.040
And here's a new way to make brains look real and, and we're constantly experimenting

29:41.040 --> 29:45.080
with death and encouraged to do so because we've cartoonified death because we don't

29:45.080 --> 29:50.560
actually, we've turned funeral parlors into, you know, the parlors of our homes into, into

29:50.560 --> 29:56.080
living rooms and, and, and, and, and put funeral parlors down the street and like made dead

29:56.080 --> 29:58.960
bodies, things that you bear, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, ranting about that.

29:58.960 --> 30:02.200
But we've, we've compartmentalized death in Western society.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.400
And so like movies are like, hey, fun.

30:04.400 --> 30:07.760
It's like, well, imagine if there's guts for flying out.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.440
Romance, however, is like, it's on these rails.

30:10.440 --> 30:15.400
It's like, like, like, okay, like, this guy's a bad guy because he's, you know, you can't,

30:15.400 --> 30:19.640
you can't do a million fun creative things with your dick and a vagina.

30:19.640 --> 30:20.640
That's pornography.

30:20.640 --> 30:26.440
Like, like, that's not, it's, it's, it's, it's like, horror is still, it's not considered

30:26.440 --> 30:34.640
pornography, but it's like, it's equally voluminous and also dealing with the primary colors

30:34.640 --> 30:36.680
of, of, of, of what we deal with.

30:36.680 --> 30:41.240
Like we're all scared of monsters and dying and stuff.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.240
Thank you.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.240
I win.

30:43.240 --> 30:48.200
I win the contest with myself to see if I can explain why horror movies are good.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.200
And they're not good.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.800
That's the other thing I wanted to ask you.

30:50.800 --> 30:55.680
You must know more than anyone how many of them are bad because for the reasons I'm describing,

30:55.680 --> 31:00.800
any, like a lot, like it actually, like more hacks are probably attracted to the bug lamp

31:00.800 --> 31:02.600
that is the horror genre.

31:02.600 --> 31:06.800
Well, that's, I mean, that's the thing is that, you know, unfortunately, not only are

31:06.800 --> 31:10.520
there a lot of bad movies, there are, you know, no offense to bad fans and that they're

31:10.520 --> 31:14.280
like, you know, you guys were talking about last week, the guys that like think shark

31:14.280 --> 31:17.000
to push and these sci-fi movies, they're funny.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.320
So you can make pretty much anything and not only will people watch it, but it's easy

31:20.320 --> 31:25.160
to sell because, you know, most horror movies are independent and it's like, oh, you killed

31:25.160 --> 31:26.160
three people in it.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.160
Cool.

31:27.160 --> 31:30.680
We can put that on the cover and, you know, sell it in Germany and sell it over here.

31:30.680 --> 31:34.400
You know, romantic comedies, all these other things, you know, that they're more star driven.

31:34.400 --> 31:38.880
You can't like make like a low budget rom-com and instantly get that sale when you go to

31:38.880 --> 31:40.440
like one of these film markets.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.400
So yeah, I'll never run out of horror movies if I wasn't quitting because there's always

31:43.400 --> 31:47.840
going to be hacks that are like, $10,000, look at that, they do paranormal activity.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.840
You know, we have a video camera and a house, we can do that, too.

31:49.840 --> 31:54.160
And so you have to sit and watch like the most horrible ones of all, which you can browse

31:54.160 --> 31:57.840
through on Apple TV and thank God for the preview feature where you can see from the

31:57.840 --> 32:03.000
trailer like, oh, Jesus, they didn't even mix their sound, like it's just like flies

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
on a tree.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.920
When you're done with this, when you watch 2,500, are you going to be happy to not have

32:06.920 --> 32:07.920
to watch these anymore?

32:07.920 --> 32:09.400
Are you still going to continue to watch horror films?

32:09.400 --> 32:10.720
No, I mean, I'll still do stuff.

32:10.720 --> 32:14.760
You know, I work for a couple of different websites now and like, I actually might be

32:14.760 --> 32:18.800
working for Netflix as like a horror expert of some sort.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.000
If anybody is, it's going to be you now, holy fuck.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.560
So, you know, so I'll still be watching.

32:23.560 --> 32:27.000
It's just like, and the site will still be there, too, and I'll update it when I feel

32:27.000 --> 32:30.160
like it, but I just won't like wake up and be like, all right, I got to find time to

32:30.160 --> 32:34.320
watch like some children of the coin sequel or something, like, you know, or if I start

32:34.320 --> 32:38.000
watching a movie and it's terrible, I'll be like a normal human being like you guys and

32:38.000 --> 32:39.680
shut it the fuck off.

32:39.680 --> 32:43.280
Now, what's your stance on the leprechaun of franchise?

32:43.280 --> 32:45.680
I like the first one when I was 13.

32:45.680 --> 32:46.680
Right.

32:46.680 --> 32:47.680
I think I watched one other.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.560
I've watched one of the, he's gone to the hood twice.

32:49.560 --> 32:50.560
Yeah.

32:50.560 --> 32:56.200
Well, that's, it's an interesting thing to look at in terms of sequelogy, like if there's

32:56.200 --> 33:01.800
a term paper you could write because let everyone kind of widely will say as a knee-jerk response

33:01.800 --> 33:07.080
if you bring up the leprechaun franchise that leprechaun, I think it was three in the hood

33:07.080 --> 33:08.080
into hood.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.080
No, no.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.680
So three was Vegas, I think, or two.

33:11.680 --> 33:13.960
Four was in space and then five and six were the hood.

33:13.960 --> 33:14.960
Oh, five.

33:14.960 --> 33:15.960
Oh, really?

33:15.960 --> 33:16.960
Yeah.

33:16.960 --> 33:17.960
Wait, the two hoods were in the row?

33:17.960 --> 33:18.960
Yeah.

33:18.960 --> 33:19.960
Are you sure about that?

33:19.960 --> 33:20.960
Yeah.

33:20.960 --> 33:21.960
Okay, okay.

33:21.960 --> 33:22.960
He goes, and it's not as interesting as I thought.

33:22.960 --> 33:23.960
He goes to space?

33:23.960 --> 33:24.960
Yeah, holy, he went to space.

33:24.960 --> 33:25.960
He went to space.

33:25.960 --> 33:26.960
He goes to the hood twice.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.240
But it was, it was better when he was in the hood.

33:29.240 --> 33:33.360
The reason why it was better when it was in the hood, you could tell watching the first

33:33.360 --> 33:38.360
one like, like, like that it was like, it felt like it was written by white screenwriters.

33:38.360 --> 33:41.600
I don't know if any of this is true, like, if everyone correct me, this is what it felt

33:41.600 --> 33:42.600
like.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.600
I'm not, I'm not a journalist here.

33:43.600 --> 33:47.480
It felt, I kept picturing like two white screenwriters going like, you know, let's

33:47.480 --> 33:54.440
write a movie for the black people that wanna, like, let's put the people in the theater

33:54.440 --> 33:58.480
that are always yelling that crazy stuff, let's put them in the movie and have them

33:58.480 --> 34:01.480
yell the stuff at the leprechaun.

34:01.480 --> 34:05.800
That's what it felt like they were, it was sort of like this weird, like, like half love,

34:05.800 --> 34:10.320
half hate, like half a racist, half like, like, like, like cultural, like, emboldening

34:10.320 --> 34:11.320
thing.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.080
It was, it was, that's what it felt like.

34:13.080 --> 34:17.080
I hope to hear it was written by a wonderful black screenwriter who was, who was just working

34:17.080 --> 34:23.760
organically and not from a weird entomology perspective by some guy going, what would

34:23.760 --> 34:24.760
they like here?

34:24.760 --> 34:29.320
I think Ice-T should say what we're all thinking when we see the leprechaun as black America,

34:29.320 --> 34:34.880
which is, you ugly motherfucker, and then pop a cap in them, try to pop a cap in them, show

34:34.880 --> 34:39.560
them that the cap popping doesn't work, show them why, they wanna know.

34:39.560 --> 34:44.920
We asked them after the first two movies, like, why wouldn't they pop a cap?

34:44.920 --> 34:48.120
You know, and, and let's show them, let's show them pop a cap and then have the caps

34:48.120 --> 34:51.600
pop right back out, and then now you're invested.

34:51.600 --> 34:56.280
But I kind of, I kind of agree with that philosophy, I'm giving, I'm giving them a weird, like,

34:56.280 --> 35:00.800
like nasal dialect, but, but that might be me, that might be how I would approach writing

35:00.800 --> 35:01.800
a leprechaun movie.

35:01.800 --> 35:06.600
Anyways, here's, here's my observation that I would like to make about the leprechaun

35:06.600 --> 35:07.600
franchise.

35:07.600 --> 35:13.760
Here's the thing, we watched, like, three of them for St. Patrick's Day, leprechaun,

35:13.760 --> 35:19.720
that's his name, definitely, like, watch these movies again, and like, watch a man, like,

35:19.720 --> 35:27.440
like, like, he's, he, he, very, very many times, under a variety of circumstances, ends

35:27.440 --> 35:35.960
up pretending to be a woman, to get a man horny, and then killing him, like, like, right

35:35.960 --> 35:38.920
as the guy is, like, about to climax.

35:38.920 --> 35:42.920
He never does the other thing, he never, like, if he wants, if he wants to just kill someone,

35:42.920 --> 35:46.960
he can just rip their finger off, or like, he'll just go like, let me give you a leg

35:46.960 --> 35:50.000
up, and then it'll just rip your leg off.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.400
So it's like, weird that he sometimes then will crouch behind a crate or a bed, and he'll

35:54.400 --> 35:59.880
just, like, a guy will be taking out the mail, and then, and then a woman will go, hey, Carl,

35:59.880 --> 36:03.880
come here, and it'll just be this sexy lady, and then they'll just keep cutting to the

36:03.880 --> 36:08.880
leprechaun behind the crate, going like, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, and he does it over and over

36:08.880 --> 36:13.160
and over again, and it keeps, I think it kind of escalates, like, I feel like the leprechaun

36:13.160 --> 36:19.720
series is about, on another level, it's about a bi-curious kind of mythical creature, like,

36:19.720 --> 36:24.880
it feels like he's getting more and more either honest or dishonest, I can't tell, because

36:24.880 --> 36:28.000
one of them's about him, he wants to marry this woman, but then he keeps on, he's like,

36:28.000 --> 36:32.640
oh, I've got, I've got you here, oh, my bride, oh, but he never does anything with her, and

36:32.640 --> 36:37.320
then he keeps making excuses to go out and just pose as more women and have fake, fake

36:37.320 --> 36:41.240
leprechaun sex with men, you know, I don't know, watch it, tell me what you think.

36:41.240 --> 36:45.320
You just put more thought into the leprechaun sequels than any other, including the people

36:45.320 --> 36:46.320
that made them.

36:46.320 --> 36:51.360
And just, well, that may be true, but mythology has a life of its own, and I feel the story

36:51.360 --> 36:56.080
being told with the leprechaun character, he's like Ulysses, you know, he's his own character,

36:56.080 --> 37:00.400
and I think that his character exists in a maelstrom of sexual feelings, you know, I

37:00.400 --> 37:06.040
feel like he's like popping out of the, in modern America, and he's going like, oh,

37:06.040 --> 37:13.000
it seems like the standards are a bit different now, what was once a little weird to go to

37:13.000 --> 37:20.320
as a place like it's now a little more, okay, I could have a lot of fun around here, and

37:20.320 --> 37:24.240
he's sort of like, you're watching him like kind of push his boundaries, his own personal

37:24.240 --> 37:29.920
boundaries, like he's getting over his own catexes, like there's no, there's no sign

37:29.920 --> 37:34.320
in the wall that says, don't be gay, like, like he's, that's in his head, but he's kind

37:34.320 --> 37:39.080
of like pushing it and pushing it, like, and he gets increasingly like more sexually amorphous

37:39.080 --> 37:42.880
as the series continues, so I think if they make another leprechaun movie, they should

37:42.880 --> 37:46.280
just have him like naked, like, like, and just kind of like, like, they're making another

37:46.280 --> 37:49.440
one, it comes out this month, okay, thank you, Adam Goldberg says they're making another

37:49.440 --> 37:53.800
one, it comes out this month, I hope it's called like leprechaun, the gloves are off,

37:53.800 --> 37:59.240
and by gloves we mean sexual hang-ups, you know, and have him just, maybe it's not a

37:59.240 --> 38:05.440
horror movie, maybe it's just about, you know, like him doing his thing, like, like, why

38:05.440 --> 38:10.120
have to end it with a guy's face getting cut off, you know, if clearly, if you look

38:10.120 --> 38:15.160
at the amount of time that's spent in each leprechaun movie, percentage-wise, it's really

38:15.160 --> 38:18.680
the more important theme in these movies is bisexuality.

38:18.680 --> 38:24.520
They keep up, I didn't watch all the, you know, all the secrets, do they keep up with

38:24.520 --> 38:25.520
it?

38:25.520 --> 38:28.040
I really remember the first one anymore, it was like they stopped him by throwing shoes

38:28.040 --> 38:30.400
at him, because he had a thing where he had to clean shoes.

38:30.400 --> 38:36.400
Yeah, that's the original, you watched over 2,000 movies now, and you didn't get through

38:36.400 --> 38:37.400
more than one leprechaun?

38:37.400 --> 38:42.400
That's the thing, that's not bad ones that I know, like, I know the leprechauns, like,

38:42.400 --> 38:45.560
especially the ones that, I mean, the first one actually played theatrically, and then

38:45.560 --> 38:46.560
it's not good news.

38:46.560 --> 38:54.640
With a child, like, like, if I can make a recommendation, I don't know how easy this

38:54.640 --> 38:59.480
is to do with Netflix's or Hulu's or whatever, but at some point in my life, a friend of

38:59.480 --> 39:06.760
mine got his hands on a copy of Child's Play, it was a Mexican, or the Spanish dub, the

39:06.760 --> 39:12.560
Spanish dub of Child's Play, and it is hilarious, it's the best fucking thing if you want to

39:12.560 --> 39:18.880
have a good time with your friends, get Spanish Child's Play, because they give him this kind

39:18.880 --> 39:28.320
of Speedy Gonzalez voice, and it's really, it's really, he's just this little Spanish

39:28.320 --> 39:33.920
guy running around, and it's good, also E.T., E.T. in Spanish is hilarious, because he really

39:33.920 --> 39:44.000
is, he just sounds like an immigrant, like an illegal alien, and it's like, and it takes

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
on a different meaning.

39:47.000 --> 39:53.480
So different, not horror, break into, is that Electric Boogaloo?

39:53.480 --> 39:59.200
Rent that movie, is that the one with turbo in it, or is that, turbo, any time turbo is

39:59.200 --> 40:03.000
on, freeze frame, because he's making the funniest face in the world.

40:03.000 --> 40:09.320
I just sent it out there, put it on, like, go to like, send images to me, any time turbo

40:09.320 --> 40:14.080
is on the camera, hit pause, funny as shit you'll ever see in your life, get high and

40:14.080 --> 40:16.880
watch break into and hit the pause.

40:16.880 --> 40:20.520
We should have like, Oprah's Book Club, we could have like a, we could have a science,

40:20.520 --> 40:24.560
like, let's all watch before we reconvene, let's all watch, we'll pick one movie that

40:24.560 --> 40:25.720
we can watch this week.

40:25.720 --> 40:26.720
Let's all watch Heart Target.

40:26.720 --> 40:27.720
And we can all talk about it.

40:27.720 --> 40:28.720
I'll talk about Wofford Brimley afterwards.

40:28.720 --> 40:33.400
Maybe we'll pick one by the end of the show and experiment with that concept.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.400
So it's called horrormovieaday.com.

40:35.400 --> 40:40.280
Horrormovieaday.com, or, yeah, it's on Blogspot, but yeah.

40:40.280 --> 40:43.360
It's on Blogspot, I mean, I don't know how you guys feel about that.

40:43.360 --> 40:47.560
Well, it's got this long, because it's Blogspot, you know, it's a URL, so it's like a whole

40:47.560 --> 40:51.560
bunch of terrible, you know, dashes and stuff, so just horrormovieaday.com.

40:51.560 --> 40:52.560
It'll redirect you.

40:52.560 --> 40:53.560
Yeah, yeah.

40:53.560 --> 40:59.280
It'll, it'll, it'll slash through your URL and, and murder it.

40:59.280 --> 41:00.280
Horrormovieaday.com.

41:00.280 --> 41:15.080
Thank, thank you, Brian W. Collins, for visiting us on the eve of your, thank you, Brian.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.080
He seems like an okay guy.

41:17.080 --> 41:20.680
He seems like, I've lost my mind watching that many horrormovies.

41:20.680 --> 41:25.520
I like, I like, I like, I like random, like, like, yeah, like, I need something like that.

41:25.520 --> 41:30.440
I need some kind of thing to come into my life where I'm like, I'm, I have a thing,

41:30.440 --> 41:34.400
you know, where you go like, okay, I'm going to do this thing now.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.400
It's called Minecraft.

41:35.400 --> 41:39.800
Well, no, I think that's, that's just, you know, like, that's, that's not, if I were

41:39.800 --> 41:43.760
to say, I'm going to play two hours of Minecraft every day or something, you could turn something

41:43.760 --> 41:48.080
unhealthy into something healthy, which is structure, you know, but that's not going

41:48.080 --> 41:49.080
to be it.

41:49.080 --> 41:50.080
That's dumb.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.080
That's a dumb idea.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.080
You just pitched.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.080
It's a dumb idea.

41:53.080 --> 41:56.320
It's something like, I'm going to, I'm going to do stained glass in my basement.

41:56.320 --> 42:00.800
I'm going to make a stained glass duck and I'm going to make a, I'm going to make my

42:00.800 --> 42:01.800
own BB gun.

42:01.800 --> 42:07.640
I'm going to make a BB gun and it's going to fire a real BB.

42:07.640 --> 42:11.200
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, uh, uh, uh, uh.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.840
Don't you owe Fox a script right now?

42:12.840 --> 42:13.840
Yeah.

42:13.840 --> 42:18.160
I'm going to write that, but then like, you know, like, then I'm going to.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.840
If I'm a Fox exec and I'm hearing this podcast next week and you're talking about making

42:21.840 --> 42:24.560
BB guns, I'm like, where's my sitcom?

42:24.560 --> 42:25.560
Yeah.

42:25.560 --> 42:26.560
I think they've moved on.

42:26.560 --> 42:31.120
I think if they're smart, but I'm saying I need a hobby, you know, at a certain point

42:31.120 --> 42:33.400
as soon as I finish my job, I need a hobby.

42:33.400 --> 42:37.240
Uh, uh, let's keep the train rolling and bring, and bring, and bring, and bring, let's get

42:37.240 --> 42:38.240
Spencer up here.

42:38.240 --> 42:39.240
Huh?

42:39.240 --> 42:40.240
All right.

42:40.240 --> 42:50.560
Because, uh, we also watched Space Jam last night.

42:50.560 --> 42:51.560
Yeah.

42:51.560 --> 42:52.560
Yeah.

42:52.560 --> 42:53.560
I got drunk and went home.

42:53.560 --> 42:54.560
I missed that one.

42:54.560 --> 42:55.560
Hello, Spencer.

42:55.560 --> 42:56.560
How are you, man?

42:56.560 --> 42:57.560
I'm, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm good.

42:57.560 --> 42:58.560
I'm good.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.680
Hey, that was a measured response.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.080
Did you stay for all of Space Jam?

43:02.080 --> 43:03.440
No, I left pretty early.

43:03.440 --> 43:06.520
I mean, I've seen that movie, but I used to watch it a lot.

43:06.520 --> 43:10.560
I had, um, you know, what were those, the Martian guys called?

43:10.560 --> 43:11.560
The Monsters.

43:11.560 --> 43:12.560
Monsters.

43:12.560 --> 43:16.120
No, before that, they had it like a dumb name that wasn't a team.

43:16.120 --> 43:19.440
It was like something Ling, I think, I don't know, whatever.

43:19.440 --> 43:22.320
I had stuffed animal versions of all the puny little versions.

43:22.320 --> 43:23.560
It was pretty awesome.

43:23.560 --> 43:27.880
And I had like a favorite, you know, but they were all really like cut and paste before

43:27.880 --> 43:29.560
they got like superpowers.

43:29.560 --> 43:30.560
So yeah.

43:30.560 --> 43:31.560
I don't know.

43:31.560 --> 43:32.560
So they were just different colors.

43:32.560 --> 43:33.560
I was like the red one.

43:33.560 --> 43:34.560
Space Jam, like the Bugs Bunny.

43:34.560 --> 43:35.560
Yeah.

43:35.560 --> 43:36.560
Yeah.

43:36.560 --> 43:37.560
Michael Jordan.

43:37.560 --> 43:38.560
Bill Murray.

43:38.560 --> 43:39.560
And Newman.

43:39.560 --> 43:40.560
Yeah.

43:40.560 --> 43:43.560
I imagine Space Jam might be some people's Xanadu in this room, you know, given the age.

43:43.560 --> 43:45.160
Does anybody here love Space Jam?

43:45.160 --> 43:46.160
Yeah.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.160
My applause.

43:47.160 --> 43:48.160
Don't raise your hands.

43:48.160 --> 43:49.160
Park up.

43:49.160 --> 43:53.160
I just played it knowing that it's terrible and non-ironically, or is it an ironic level?

43:53.160 --> 43:55.160
I grew up in Chicago in the 90s.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.160
Michael Jordan was like a god.

43:57.160 --> 43:58.160
I thought it was the greatest movie ever made.

43:58.160 --> 44:00.160
So you love it because Michael Jordan is a protagonist in it?

44:00.160 --> 44:02.160
Or is he like a guest star in it?

44:02.160 --> 44:03.160
Or is he a visitant?

44:03.160 --> 44:04.160
No.

44:04.160 --> 44:05.160
He's a guest star.

44:05.160 --> 44:07.160
It's a buddy comedy with him and, you know, Bugs Bunny.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.160
Space Jam.

44:08.160 --> 44:09.160
Yeah.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.160
Wait.

44:10.160 --> 44:13.160
All I remember is Marvin Martians in it, right?

44:13.160 --> 44:15.160
Isn't he out there like a...

44:15.160 --> 44:16.160
Yeah.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.160
Yeah.

44:17.160 --> 44:19.160
And they play basketball.

44:19.160 --> 44:21.160
If I were to...

44:21.160 --> 44:29.160
I tried to run through today the narrative, like, kind of cascade of, like, why are ending

44:29.160 --> 44:32.160
with the answer to why are they playing basketball?

44:32.160 --> 44:33.160
Why?

44:33.160 --> 44:34.160
What are the stakes?

44:34.160 --> 44:41.160
It starts five iterations up, like, on a planet that is both animated but not Looney Tune

44:41.160 --> 44:42.160
planet.

44:42.160 --> 44:45.160
It's a planet of animated monsters that need amusement.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.160
They're in an amusement shortage.

44:47.160 --> 44:52.160
And the boss of that planet says, I want the Looney Tunes to work for us.

44:52.160 --> 44:55.160
And he sends his henchmen out and the henchmen go and they make the...

44:55.160 --> 44:57.160
They tell the Looney Tunes, you have to work for us.

44:57.160 --> 45:02.160
And the Looney Tunes go, you know, they use Bugs Bunny Clever Power to go, hey, we have

45:02.160 --> 45:03.160
to...

45:03.160 --> 45:06.160
We get a chance to fight back before you indenture us into servitude.

45:06.160 --> 45:11.160
And instead of just saying, you're not allowed to do this, Bugs Bunny says, you have to

45:11.160 --> 45:15.160
give us a right chance to fight back, and they go, okay, how?

45:15.160 --> 45:20.160
And they go, okay, they're really small, so let's play basketball.

45:20.160 --> 45:26.160
So then because they say basketball, the monster aliens steal the talent from Charles Barclay

45:26.160 --> 45:30.160
and Lil Pennier, whoever was in a Nike commercial back then.

45:30.160 --> 45:34.160
And they all grow big because that means they're talented.

45:34.160 --> 45:42.160
And because they do that, then the Looney Tunes go and abduct Michael Jordan from a golf course.

45:42.160 --> 45:46.160
Meanwhile, there's a B story to the movie which details Michael Jordan's emotional journey

45:46.160 --> 45:53.160
from going from basketball player to baseball player to golf hobbyist and friend of Bill Murray.

45:53.160 --> 46:02.160
Bill Murray, meanwhile, walks into and out of the movie of his own free will anytime he wants.

46:02.160 --> 46:09.160
Just like in the middle of his own scenes, he'll just go, yeah, well, that's what I'm trying to...

46:09.160 --> 46:12.160
And he'll just disappear from coverage.

46:12.160 --> 46:13.160
Where'd Bill Murray go?

46:13.160 --> 46:14.160
Wasn't he there a second ago?

46:14.160 --> 46:15.160
Yeah, I guess he got tired.

46:15.160 --> 46:17.160
It's like in Tootsie.

46:17.160 --> 46:18.160
He's there, he's gone.

46:18.160 --> 46:20.160
Yeah, he's just bad.

46:20.160 --> 46:25.160
So there's another character played by the fat guy from Jurassic Park who I...

46:25.160 --> 46:28.160
My writer's eye tells me it's the same character.

46:28.160 --> 46:29.160
Yeah, Wayne Knight.

46:29.160 --> 46:33.160
It's the same character, but for all the scenes Bill Murray couldn't do.

46:33.160 --> 46:34.160
No.

46:34.160 --> 46:35.160
Wayne Knight is kind of...

46:35.160 --> 46:36.160
There's another character.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.160
He's Michael Jordan's agent or something.

46:38.160 --> 46:45.160
But anyways, like I said, if I were to start trying to explain Space Jam to you, we'd be here until like 9 p.m.

46:45.160 --> 46:47.160
But there are people who love the movie.

46:47.160 --> 46:51.160
On its own merits or simply because you were from Chicago and Michael Jordan lived there?

46:51.160 --> 46:53.160
It was great.

46:53.160 --> 46:54.160
Come up on stage.

46:54.160 --> 46:55.160
Can we get you on stage?

46:55.160 --> 46:56.160
What's your name?

46:56.160 --> 46:57.160
What's your name?

46:57.160 --> 46:58.160
Shannon.

46:58.160 --> 46:59.160
Shannon.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.160
Shannon.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.160
Shannon.

47:01.160 --> 47:02.160
Space Jam apologist.

47:02.160 --> 47:03.160
Hi.

47:03.160 --> 47:07.160
I mean, I love being right about stuff, so let me try to...

47:07.160 --> 47:10.160
I'll answer the question for her and we'll see if she agrees.

47:10.160 --> 47:15.160
Some movies are so like loud and big and weird and have such a time in your life.

47:15.160 --> 47:17.160
That's why I've brought up the Xanadu comparison.

47:17.160 --> 47:19.160
There's no arguing that Xanadu is a good movie.

47:19.160 --> 47:23.160
Xanadu is an insane movie, though, and it was part of my childhood.

47:23.160 --> 47:27.160
All right, go, Shannon.

47:27.160 --> 47:29.160
So when someone asks, do you like it ironically or not ironically?

47:29.160 --> 47:31.160
No, I like Mac and me ironically.

47:31.160 --> 47:35.160
Like, that's a horrible movie and I don't actually have any connection to it.

47:35.160 --> 47:37.160
But you have an emotional connection to a...

47:37.160 --> 47:38.160
I do.

47:38.160 --> 47:39.160
Space Jam.

47:39.160 --> 47:42.160
But you could probably recognize with your adult brain.

47:42.160 --> 47:43.160
Yes.

47:43.160 --> 47:44.160
Yes.

47:44.160 --> 47:45.160
But that doesn't...

47:45.160 --> 47:49.160
You know, it doesn't stop me from having kind of an emotional reaction to it even now in adulthood.

47:49.160 --> 47:51.160
And there's a lot of movies.

47:51.160 --> 47:53.160
Goonies, I'm looking at you.

47:53.160 --> 48:00.160
Like, my generation, I'm 40 now, I can finally start saying this without getting booed because I'm getting so old.

48:00.160 --> 48:09.160
But 10 years ago, if I said Goonies was shitty, which it is, it is.

48:09.160 --> 48:16.160
Goonies is a ridiculous cacophony of logical loop-to-loops.

48:16.160 --> 48:27.160
It is an insane, it is an opera written by a madman in a footlocker at the bottom of the ocean.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.160
Goonies is out of the show.

48:29.160 --> 48:33.160
What's a better movie as a whole, Space Jam or Goonies?

48:33.160 --> 48:35.160
Space Jam.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.160
No, fuck you.

48:36.160 --> 48:38.160
No, Goonies is better than Space Jam.

48:38.160 --> 48:40.160
You pushed him.

48:40.160 --> 48:41.160
I almost had him.

48:41.160 --> 48:43.160
Goonies is better than Space Jam.

48:43.160 --> 48:50.160
Goonies, okay, here's the difference between a sociopath and a regular murderer.

48:50.160 --> 48:54.160
Goonies knows what it's doing wrong.

48:54.160 --> 48:58.160
Space Jam will kill again if you don't lock it up.

48:58.160 --> 49:00.160
Space Jam has no idea.

49:00.160 --> 49:01.160
Space Jam's like, what?

49:01.160 --> 49:03.160
Yeah, I'm a movie.

49:03.160 --> 49:06.160
Goonies is like, I'm a movie.

49:06.160 --> 49:10.160
They know, they know.

49:10.160 --> 49:18.160
If there was a Goonies too, we'd focus on the chunk character more and do more blender scenes.

49:18.160 --> 49:22.160
Space Jam would be like, well, what have we learned?

49:22.160 --> 49:24.160
Cha-ching?

49:24.160 --> 49:27.160
I don't feel like Space Jam knew what it was doing.

49:27.160 --> 49:30.160
Shannon, how many times have you seen Space Jam?

49:30.160 --> 49:32.160
How many times have you viewed Space Jam?

49:32.160 --> 49:37.160
In my childhood, probably in the dozens, I haven't seen it in quite a while,

49:37.160 --> 49:41.160
because my parents have it on VHS and nobody fucking has a VCR anymore.

49:41.160 --> 49:43.160
Alright.

49:43.160 --> 49:44.160
Really?

49:44.160 --> 49:47.160
Space Jam party.

49:47.160 --> 49:49.160
I'm sure it's Space Jam's on YouTube.

49:49.160 --> 49:51.160
I don't know.

49:51.160 --> 49:54.160
I'm 40, I don't care.

49:54.160 --> 49:57.160
Is it Space Jam and one of your little friendship bracelets?

49:57.160 --> 50:00.160
Can't you just download it on a USB dongle?

50:00.160 --> 50:04.160
Shannon, what are your favorite movies of all time?

50:04.160 --> 50:08.160
What do you think of as your favorite genre, your favorite kind of movie?

50:08.160 --> 50:10.160
Or your favorite, do you have a favorite movie?

50:10.160 --> 50:12.160
My favorite movie is Stripes, actually.

50:12.160 --> 50:14.160
Stripes is a good name.

50:14.160 --> 50:16.160
When's the last time you saw it?

50:16.160 --> 50:18.160
Probably in the last year, I haven't on DVD.

50:18.160 --> 50:21.160
I mean, some of these movies you go back to, like Back to the Future,

50:21.160 --> 50:23.160
I saw Double Future, Back to the Future and Goonies,

50:23.160 --> 50:27.160
and it was like a, because they're both right around the same time,

50:27.160 --> 50:32.160
but it was like a study in, okay, there are movies from a certain age

50:32.160 --> 50:34.160
when your brain was like firing certain chemicals,

50:34.160 --> 50:37.160
like you have permanent imprints on these movies,

50:37.160 --> 50:41.160
and I would call them identical walking into that theater as a 30-something.

50:41.160 --> 50:43.160
I was like, I'm going to see Goonies in Back to the Future too.

50:43.160 --> 50:49.160
Indelible, comparable, like masterpieces from my childhood era,

50:49.160 --> 50:51.160
but walking out of the theater, I was like, okay, come on,

50:51.160 --> 50:55.160
Goonies was a nostalgic mess.

50:55.160 --> 50:59.160
Back to the Future, I think Remains is kind of a well-structured

50:59.160 --> 51:03.160
little piece of cinema that took seven years to write and blah, blah, blah.

51:03.160 --> 51:05.160
What were we talking about?

51:05.160 --> 51:06.160
Space Jam.

51:06.160 --> 51:09.160
Space Jam versus Stripes.

51:09.160 --> 51:12.160
Stripes, I'm afraid to go back and watch, is my point.

51:12.160 --> 51:13.160
Why would you be afraid?

51:13.160 --> 51:16.160
I'm just afraid it will be Goonies rather than Back to the Future.

51:16.160 --> 51:23.160
Stripes is hilarious because there's 11 35-year-olds pretending to join the military.

51:23.160 --> 51:28.160
There's clearly people in their 40s that are in this unit, it's really funny.

51:28.160 --> 51:34.160
Everybody's drunk in it, John Candy, John Lyric, everybody's just a bunch of alcoholics.

51:34.160 --> 51:35.160
Remember what that movie is?

51:35.160 --> 51:38.160
It has a very strange, it's got a three-act structure overall,

51:38.160 --> 51:42.160
but it also exists in two giant acts because there's the point where they actually,

51:42.160 --> 51:46.160
like in the 11th hour, but the movie's only halfway over.

51:46.160 --> 51:49.160
It seems like the movie is over and then we have a whole other plot happening.

51:49.160 --> 51:52.160
It turns into this weird action movie with the RV and stuff, but it was good.

51:52.160 --> 51:55.160
It shares that with the good Batman movie.

51:55.160 --> 51:58.160
That Batman movie was like, what the fuck, when's this over?

51:58.160 --> 51:59.160
I don't care, I don't know.

51:59.160 --> 52:04.160
All right, now, okay, truck chase, okay, fuck it.

52:04.160 --> 52:08.160
It was...

52:08.160 --> 52:10.160
Well, thank you, Shannon, Shannon, everybody.

52:10.160 --> 52:17.160
Shannon, thanks for coming up and talking about Space Jam.

52:17.160 --> 52:18.160
Space Jam.

52:18.160 --> 52:20.160
What did they come up with that name too?

52:20.160 --> 52:22.160
I'll tell you exactly where they came up with that name.

52:22.160 --> 52:24.160
They tested each letter of each word.

52:24.160 --> 52:29.160
Okay, so far, we've got spud cum.

52:29.160 --> 52:33.160
No, no, no, people like a more than you.

52:33.160 --> 52:36.160
Space spade cum?

52:36.160 --> 52:39.160
I always thought it was because there was jock jams at that point, right?

52:39.160 --> 52:40.160
Wasn't there a thing where...

52:40.160 --> 52:41.160
I don't know.

52:41.160 --> 52:45.160
I would like to be a fly on any wall during any part of any branch.

52:45.160 --> 52:47.160
Adam Goldberg, why was it called Space Jam?

52:47.160 --> 52:49.160
They used jam all the time in the 90s.

52:49.160 --> 52:52.160
It was the number one word, the way rad ruled the 80s.

52:52.160 --> 52:54.160
And agent.

52:54.160 --> 52:56.160
That's not your name.

52:56.160 --> 52:58.160
Adam Goldberg is my name.

52:58.160 --> 53:01.160
And consulting producer on community, Adam F. Goldberg's name.

53:01.160 --> 53:03.160
Not the same person.

53:03.160 --> 53:04.160
Okay, that was my fault.

53:04.160 --> 53:06.160
That was my bad.

53:06.160 --> 53:10.160
No, I tapped that hornet's nest.

53:10.160 --> 53:13.160
When he started saying they used jam all the time in the 90s,

53:13.160 --> 53:15.160
I was like, wait a minute, come on.

53:15.160 --> 53:17.160
I thought he meant jelly?

53:17.160 --> 53:19.160
No.

53:19.160 --> 53:20.160
Come on, no more than the 80s.

53:20.160 --> 53:22.160
I was there for all of this.

53:22.160 --> 53:25.160
Jam did not become a bigger thing.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.160
I'm officially my grandparents.

53:27.160 --> 53:28.160
The 90s had...

53:28.160 --> 53:31.160
Come on, young man, jam is a universal...

53:31.160 --> 53:34.160
The 90s did have jock jams and pearl jams,

53:34.160 --> 53:36.160
and we had less than 90s jam.

53:36.160 --> 53:39.160
Jam, jock jams and pearl jams.

53:39.160 --> 53:41.160
Isn't that gross if they name their band Pearl Jam?

53:41.160 --> 53:42.160
That's gross.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.160
Pearl jam sucks.

53:43.160 --> 53:44.160
Fuck Pearl Jam.

53:44.160 --> 53:45.160
Oh, come on, Jeff.

53:45.160 --> 53:46.160
Oh, fuck him, that's terrible.

53:46.160 --> 53:48.160
Hey, Jeff.

53:48.160 --> 53:52.160
Why are you going to make me feel bad about my band?

53:52.160 --> 53:54.160
Oh, Eddie.

53:54.160 --> 53:57.160
No.

53:57.160 --> 53:59.160
We are people.

53:59.160 --> 54:04.160
We have feelings you brought them.

54:04.160 --> 54:06.160
It was the 90s.

54:06.160 --> 54:08.160
It was a great time to be an angry white guy

54:08.160 --> 54:10.160
and be all bummed out and wear a fucking helmet.

54:10.160 --> 54:13.160
Before we called it emo and just kind of like,

54:13.160 --> 54:15.160
both embraced it and wrote it off,

54:15.160 --> 54:18.160
but it was like it was being presented as if this is the new thing.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.160
I think that was uncomfortable for people.

54:20.160 --> 54:23.160
And I invite all of you to tell me I'm a bad person online

54:23.160 --> 54:25.160
for not liking Pearl Jam.

54:25.160 --> 54:26.160
It's going to happen.

54:26.160 --> 54:27.160
There will be a lot of bad...

54:27.160 --> 54:28.160
I don't think that's going to happen.

54:28.160 --> 54:29.160
Yeah, you know why?

54:29.160 --> 54:30.160
Because they're indefensible.

54:30.160 --> 54:32.160
Pearl Jam is an unsupportable band.

54:32.160 --> 54:33.160
They'll accept.

54:33.160 --> 54:35.160
These guys, look at them.

54:35.160 --> 54:36.160
Look out in this audience.

54:36.160 --> 54:37.160
Look at these jams.

54:37.160 --> 54:38.160
Shannon, do you love Pearl Jam too?

54:38.160 --> 54:39.160
No.

54:39.160 --> 54:40.160
Okay, good.

54:40.160 --> 54:41.160
So she's not just jam-centric.

54:41.160 --> 54:42.160
No.

54:42.160 --> 54:45.160
These guys are post-itunes.

54:45.160 --> 54:48.160
They're little tune babies.

54:48.160 --> 54:53.160
They have little hologram dongles that they use to subscribe to their music

54:53.160 --> 54:55.160
from a stream and a cloud.

54:55.160 --> 55:00.160
And part of that is that they don't have the same emotional...

55:00.160 --> 55:06.160
They go, oh, did you hear that new granddaddy?

55:06.160 --> 55:11.160
I heard that EP was an LP on the SP.

55:11.160 --> 55:13.160
No, I don't.

55:13.160 --> 55:15.160
I don't either.

55:15.160 --> 55:18.160
I'm just trying to get through it.

55:18.160 --> 55:21.160
You had to put all this energy into buying an album.

55:21.160 --> 55:26.160
Spencer, if you bought a Led Zeppelin album and someone else said Led Zeppelin sucked,

55:26.160 --> 55:27.160
you got something to defend.

55:27.160 --> 55:33.160
But if you download Zigger Splicket, you don't care.

55:33.160 --> 55:36.160
You got a whole fucking catalog of shit.

55:36.160 --> 55:42.160
Everyone's an individual, so they don't really care that much if someone goes like,

55:42.160 --> 55:45.160
and no one's gonna go, that's stupid, that sucks.

55:45.160 --> 55:51.160
I think maybe I'm projecting onto them my wishes for the younger generation to be more actualized.

55:51.160 --> 55:53.160
Spencer, are you a music purchaser?

55:53.160 --> 55:55.160
Are you a music guy?

55:55.160 --> 55:56.160
No.

55:56.160 --> 55:58.160
I mean, I listen to lots of music.

55:58.160 --> 56:00.160
I don't purchase a lot of music.

56:00.160 --> 56:03.160
How do you get your music?

56:03.160 --> 56:10.160
You know, sometimes I'm just on my computer, and this is legal stuff, man.

56:10.160 --> 56:14.160
They're gonna listen to this podcast, and they're gonna hunt me down.

56:14.160 --> 56:20.160
Sometimes a bit just falls on me, and then sometimes more of them come in like a torrent.

56:20.160 --> 56:24.160
Sometimes you just get caught in a tempest of fights.

56:24.160 --> 56:29.160
Of peer-to-peer pressure.

56:29.160 --> 56:31.160
So you've been stealing music online all the time?

56:31.160 --> 56:41.160
I mean, I've bought maybe three albums in my life, but I mean, like, six days of music probably.

56:41.160 --> 56:43.160
But I don't know, it's really eclectic.

56:43.160 --> 56:47.160
I usually get discographies, and then I'm like, oh, I like this album and this album,

56:47.160 --> 56:51.160
and delete a lot of stuff, and then I have what I like, and I kind of just cycle through it randomly.

56:51.160 --> 56:53.160
What's in heavy rotation for you right now?

56:53.160 --> 56:54.160
What's in the car?

56:54.160 --> 56:55.160
Let's see.

56:55.160 --> 56:59.160
Borders of Canada has some good tracks.

56:59.160 --> 57:03.160
Yeah, I think the campfire head phase is the album I've been listening to a lot.

57:03.160 --> 57:10.160
There's Delorean is a band with an album called Subiza, which is just really delicious.

57:10.160 --> 57:17.160
Gold Panda makes this really weird electronic music, and it's pretty awesome.

57:17.160 --> 57:22.160
I listened to it on an airport, and it was perfect.

57:22.160 --> 57:23.160
What about Nosecone?

57:23.160 --> 57:24.160
You listen to Nosecone?

57:24.160 --> 57:28.160
Oh yeah, you know, Nosecone, he had some deep YouTube riffs.

57:28.160 --> 57:29.160
I was really into that.

57:29.160 --> 57:30.160
Wait, I just made that name up.

57:30.160 --> 57:32.160
I was ripping the audio, yeah.

57:32.160 --> 57:34.160
No, I'm bullshitting also.

57:34.160 --> 57:35.160
Oh, okay.

57:35.160 --> 57:40.160
I thought I ripped a real guy, and I wanted to cop to it.

57:40.160 --> 57:41.160
I felt bad.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.160
I sent me to play some D&D.

57:42.160 --> 57:43.160
How's that sound right now?

57:43.160 --> 57:45.160
Well, we got to get Camille out here.

57:45.160 --> 57:46.160
Camille.

57:46.160 --> 57:51.160
Camille, you like Nosecone?

57:51.160 --> 57:53.160
No, I like the Peaceful Mutants.

57:53.160 --> 57:54.160
They're really good right now.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.160
Sandblast.

57:55.160 --> 57:58.160
I have a couple of points to make.

57:58.160 --> 58:04.160
Space Jam is clearly from NBA Jam, which was a huge basketball game in the night.

58:04.160 --> 58:08.160
Don't clap, Adam Goldberg, as if that's what you were saying.

58:08.160 --> 58:12.160
The other point, you gave it so much shit for exposition.

58:12.160 --> 58:19.160
You got to jump through a lot of hoops to get Elmer Fudd and Michael Jordan in the same room.

58:19.160 --> 58:26.160
You can't just be like, open on basketball court. Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan are hanging out.

58:26.160 --> 58:30.160
Okay, here's how many hoops you have to jump through to get Elmer Fudd and Michael Jordan in the same room.

58:30.160 --> 58:34.160
The same number of hoops that they jumped to get Michael Jordan in the same room.

58:34.160 --> 58:39.160
One, they jumped Michael Jordan through a literal and figurative threshold.

58:39.160 --> 58:45.160
They sucked him through a golf course hole into Cartoonland, and Elmer Fudd was right there.

58:45.160 --> 58:50.160
And said, oh hi, Michael Jordan, I love you.

58:50.160 --> 58:53.160
They're a crime that they committed.

58:53.160 --> 58:56.160
By the way, I am not defending this movie at all.

58:56.160 --> 58:59.160
Just for fun, defend it.

58:59.160 --> 59:03.160
It's really good.

59:03.160 --> 59:11.160
You're saying it's a necessary evil because of a subject matter that there needs to be five thresholds instead of one threshold.

59:11.160 --> 59:16.160
You're saying that will never be true until our son Supernovas.

59:16.160 --> 59:20.160
Our stories are allowed to just have one fucking like what if.

59:20.160 --> 59:25.160
I've never full disclosure, never seen the movie.

59:25.160 --> 59:29.160
Or finish the word disclosure. Never done that.

59:29.160 --> 59:33.160
Full disclosure.

59:33.160 --> 59:38.160
Can I also, you were talking about human planet, can I quickly say what my favorite thing of that is?

59:38.160 --> 59:39.160
Speak it will.

59:39.160 --> 59:42.160
It's all like humans in extreme conditions.

59:42.160 --> 59:46.160
Papa Nagini, there's this one village that just eats sharks.

59:46.160 --> 59:50.160
That's all they eat, which is like sort of an arrogant dickish move, you know?

59:50.160 --> 59:53.160
They're like, you have fruit. What are you doing?

59:53.160 --> 59:55.160
They're like, well, sharks, we eat them for breakfast.

59:55.160 --> 59:57.160
Like that's what they're going for.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.160
So they have one guy in the village who's the designated shark hunter.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.160
And now he's like 70, and then they just like send this guy out.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.160
He's like, all right, I'll go get more shark. And he gets into a canoe that he's made.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.160
And he's like seven and he's like ripped.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.160
Are these the guys that just like strangled him on the side of the boat?

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I was going to tell the story.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.160
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:22.160
He's like super ripped like, but he's like like Nepal ripped, you know, not like Jim ripped.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.160
Like Sri Lanka ripped. So he gets into the boat.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.160
And he goes.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.160
I want to be Sri Lanka ripped.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.160
It's great. It's great.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:36.160
And he just goes to the middle of the ocean and then he starts singing his shark beckoning song.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.160
No, I fucking swear to you.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.160
Yeah, well, I don't want to do the song for you because even flu.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.160
Yeah, that's what it is.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.160
It would sound like this.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:52.160
What the song sounds like pretend you're a racist and then imagine a tribal song.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.160
That's what it sounds like.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.160
Do it. Do it. Just do it.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.160
Now that you just claimed it by saying it sounds racist.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.160
Pearl Jam.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.160
Pearl Jam. You're doing Pearl Jam.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.160
Yeah, it's a lot like Pearl Jam.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.160
And then he sings this fucking song with just a hint of Hepburn.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.160
Just a shining army.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:21.160
It's a little bit like what was that song sadness?

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.160
Everything's going backwards or whatever.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.160
Candescence, what's it called?

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.160
Enigma.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.160
Enigma.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.160
So he starts singing this fucking song, okay?

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.160
And he's singing it all day and all night.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.160
There's no food because they run out of shark.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.160
All day, all night on day three, a shark shows up.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.160
And even then John Hurt is like...

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.160
And he has the balls to assume it's the song.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.160
I know.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.160
I want to go up to the guy and be like, try once without the song.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.160
One time a control group.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.160
Exactly. Just once.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:58.160
Either I believe it was a coincidence or that the magical shark beckoning song works

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.160
and everything I know is lies, you know?

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:06.160
It only takes six days to test the theory that without a song, the shark takes twice as long as you show it.

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.160
Just do it once.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.160
So the shark shows up and then he starts fashioning a noose,

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.160
which I'm like, have the noose already fashioned?

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.160
You've been there for three days.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.160
Get the new, act like you've been there, you know?

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.160
So he...

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160
Yeah, B do have.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.160
Yeah, B do...

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.160
So he...

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.160
Always be noose-making.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.160
But this is my favorite part.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.160
He always be noose-making.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.160
Shark is for closers.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.160
I've got a 12-foot boat.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.160
I've got a custom-made shark noose.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.160
That's my name.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.160
Who the fuck are you?

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.160
David Mammet presents...

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.160
The Shark Stranglers.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:48.160
So he fashions this noose and as the shark...

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.160
This is my favorite part.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.160
As the shark is going by, he lassoes the shark in the open ocean.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.160
He lassoes it and then I swear, he lassoes it and then he does like a fist pump.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.160
He's like, yes.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.160
So I'm like, we're all human.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.160
Everybody does that.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160
Yeah.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.160
Because like that's the only gesture we have.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.160
You might have picked that up from the camera crew.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.160
Amazing.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.160
They were like, holy shit, I have just enough SD card to store that footage.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.160
Yeah.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.160
And he was like, oh really?

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.160
Yeah.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.160
Exactly.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.160
So like the SD card gesture.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.160
I wonder that when they're getting the shots.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.160
It's like clearly you're getting the shot from a jeep, but you're studying these guys

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.160
who just hang out with wearing blankets for shirts and bluffing lines.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.160
I mean, the gods must be crazy.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160
What's happening here?

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160
Is that contamination?

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:32.160
I always thought there was, like a couple years ago they found a new tribe in the Amazon

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.160
and all the pictures were like, they were like, you know, they were like looking up at this

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.160
thing, this helicopter and they were like, we didn't want to disturb them.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.160
We didn't want to go down.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.160
You've already changed everything.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.160
That helicopter is their god now.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.160
It's like Iceman.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.160
Yeah.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.160
They're going to go back and be like, burn the books.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.160
This is all lies.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.160
Look at that thing.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.160
Look at that.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.160
Todd, what have I been saying?

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.160
Yeah.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.160
See, I told you.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160
Madeleine Burr.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.160
I used to worship a toucan.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.160
Look at that fucking thing.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.160
There's three of us inside that toucan.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.160
They're clearly like, all of them have like their bows and arrows out, like pointing

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.160
at this thing.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.160
You've changed everything.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.160
You don't even mean like-

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.160
That's a clear example of that.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.160
Those guys actually live in actual isolation and that kind of contamination.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.160
But also there's just like, these people, they know what a Jeep is and they know what

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.160
a camera crew is.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.160
They're bringing a camera crew along and they're saying like, the camera crew is going, show

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:37.160
us how you bring your 18 cattle from 600 miles across the desert.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.160
And then have a weird negotiation with the elephants with a stick in order to get your

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.160
cattle fed.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.160
And that's like, I just mean like emotional, psychological, long-term contamination of

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.160
like this 16-year-old kid going like-

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.160
Yes.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.160
Fuck.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.160
Go faster in a Jeep.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.160
Yeah.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.160
All right, see you later.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.160
That's a wrap.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.160
Yeah.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.160
They should just show them on their iPad like Phantom Menace.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.160
Like, watch this.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.160
All right, we're going to go.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.160
Yeah.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.160
Like, yeah, I don't know.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.160
I mean, it's so weird.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.160
Like, that's not- everyone knows it's weird.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.160
Erin McGathy, you're here tonight?

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.160
Let's get Erin McGathy up here, shall we?

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.160
Erin McGathy.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:15.160
The only thing I just saw Leprechaun in the hood, the only thing I wanted from that movie

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:19.160
was the Leprechaun to refer to as part of gold as bling.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.160
That is all I wanted out of it.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.160
That might have come- the bling might have happened after the first Leprechaun in the

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.160
hood.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.160
Maybe, because I didn't- he was never like, ah, it gets to me bling or whatever.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:37.160
They really like- it was a very selective like a membrane in terms of what racism got

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.160
through and what they refused it to.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.160
It's very weird.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:44.160
Like, you'd look at one example and go like, well, that's just- that's just ridiculous.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.160
Like, why would you do that?

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.160
And then the other one would go, well, why would you choke up on that bat?

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:58.160
I can't think of examples, but the- when you watch Leprechaun tonight, here's an interesting

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.160
thing.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:06.160
There's a point in the movie where he has beguiled this trio of Hoochie mamas, badonkadonks.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.160
I don't know what you'd call them in the-

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.160
I think that's the preferred nomenclature.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.160
Yeah.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.160
They're zombie fly ladies.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.160
They're zombie fly ladies.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160
They're zombie fly ladies.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.160
And that's right.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.160
It's a sort of multi-ethnic, like, trio of like, yeah, they have green eyes underneath

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:25.160
their ray bands and they have like gold tight-fitting lame dresses and they don't match with their

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.160
shoes.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.160
They don't explain where they came from except through some weird ADR line.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.160
Then they're just there.

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.160
Then during the ending credits, you see the origin.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.160
He does a rap in a-

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.160
Oh, that's right.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.160
Which you'd expect to see in a movie called Leprechaun Into Hood.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.160
You'd expect to see where David's do a rap.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.160
And he doesn't do it until the ending credits.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.160
And he's like, oh, my name is Leprechaun.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.160
I'm here to say I just came from Dublin to the shuttle today.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:57.160
I got my bling-bling bloom and my blarney stone and I'll possess your mind and you're not alone.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:03.160
And while he's doing it, he's like hypnotizing these fly girls in this bar that we never

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.160
saw in the movie.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:09.160
So it seems very clear to me that they extracted that scene from the middle of the movie where

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.160
it really belonged.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:16.160
And the only reason I can think that they extracted it is that they actually hit some kind of

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:20.160
threshold where people, the test viewers are like, yeah, you know what, come on.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.160
I want to make fun of the movie.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.160
I don't want you to piranha 3D me.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.160
They actually hit a tipping point where people are like, fuck you.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:35.160
When he started rapping, it's like, well, what's my job?

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.160
I'm supposed to get high and watch a movie.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.160
If you guys are high, fuck you.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.160
And they went, oh, you know what?

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.160
Yeah, people like that it's campy.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.160
They like that it's stupid and they want to make fun of the movie.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:50.160
We need to actually commit to our job and move this rap number to the ending credits.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:55.160
I thought you were saying that they'd hit too many cultural urban things.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.160
And then people were like, all right, that's too much shit.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.160
And then over the credits, you can be as offensive as you want.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.160
That wasn't my guess.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.160
Truthfully on that topic, I felt like all of pound for pound.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:12.160
I found myself going, I expected to be quote unquote offended.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.160
I expected to be going, what?

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.160
Way more per minute.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.160
This movie is kind of safe.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.160
It was pretty safe for a movie called Leprechaun and the Hood.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:27.160
Warwick Davis has said little people write back like so many hundreds of years with his body of war.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.160
I mean, has he or is he?

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:36.160
It's like what, like, you know, like, wow, God, how do I get out of this?

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.160
What I was going to say, like, it's true for a lot of like urban youth.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.160
The way out is basketball or rapping.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.160
Right.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.160
And so for little people now it's like becoming in horror movie.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:56.160
Are you a hero if you get into the NBA or are you perpetuating like a cycle of like, you know, unrealistic expectations or whatever that you would call it.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.160
No idea.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:07.160
But I want to see a one act black box theater production about a mythical meeting on a fateful 1998 night between Peter Dinklage and Warwick Davis.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.160
He's like, all right, I'm going to go to the right.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160
You go to the left.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.160
I'm going to do eventually Game of Thrones and movies that are Oscars.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.160
You can rap in an Irish accent.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:22.160
Like they do plays of like what if, what if on the eve of his assassination, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X like had a conversation.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.160
Like they do plays like that.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.160
That's really funny.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.160
Dinklage and Warwick Davis.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.160
I bet they hate each other.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:38.160
But you have, you have normal people play the like non little people because you're like, like, like, no, the big draw here is that, you know, this is, I mean, God, this is David Strathain for God's sake.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.160
You just tie like shoes at their knees.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.160
Is that what you're suggesting?

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.160
Door style?

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.160
Maybe you just make the sets really.

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.160
Or yeah, yeah, just make Lily Tomlin it.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.160
Just have giant chairs.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:50.160
It's going to all be set at a real Abed restaurant.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.160
No, that's the other way.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.160
It's going to be the reverse of that.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.160
Or maybe it starts at Abed's restaurant and then they leave and you're like, oh no, everything.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.160
There was little.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.160
Yeah.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.160
You don't know.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.160
He says goodbye.

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.160
Thank you for coming to what's the name of Abed's restaurant?

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.160
Bites.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.160
Bites.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:13.160
And then didn't you pitch an idea where it's just leftovers that it was like just bites, bites taken out of burgers and stuff?

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:20.160
My question was were there to be things shaped like the bite that somebody took or would it be a hamburger with a bite already taken out of it?

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.160
No, I think the appeal is that it's a miniature version of the truest.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160
Yeah.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.160
Although that's a good idea.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.160
Yeah.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.160
You could call it, are you going to finish that?

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:37.160
All right, Spencer, get us up to date on the D&D.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.160
All right, I won.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.160
Last town on Harmontown.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.160
Wait, wait, wait.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.160
Last town?

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.160
What?

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.160
Sorry, go ahead.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.160
After fighting with a grip of sinister serpentine foes, Sharpie had been poisoned.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.160
As the fast-acting poison coursed through his veins, the wizard fell into a deep slumber.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:05.160
Realizing what must be done, Mulraine Sedona donned her hat of disguise, taking the form of someone she thought must look like Sharpie's mother,

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.160
before attempting some curious reprogramming on the sleeping mage.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:17.160
Quark and Christopher got uncomfortable and checked out some old statues to pass the time, but realizing the flaws in Mulraine's methodology,

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.160
attempted to grease the wheels on the whole situation.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.160
After being gripped tightly by the dreaming wizard, Christopher freaked out and stabbed him with a knife,

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.160
waking the wizard with a quick prick.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:32.160
After some discussion, the group entered the larger chamber, bisected by a cracked staircase,

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.160
and started to try and figure out some rope situations to get the treasure.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:40.160
Their musings were interrupted by a powerful voice taunting them.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.160
A dragon!

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.160
Recognizing the dire danger that this magical beast presented, the gang launched into action.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.160
The barbarians slashed and raged and then tried to climb up to statue or something.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.160
Mulraine fired arrows.

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:56.160
Sharpie summoned the monstrous scorpions Keith and David to distract and threaten the dragon,

01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.160
while the sneaky robes stabbed the dragon in the dick with a paralyzing syringe.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:05.160
The attacks seemed to be working, but still the dragon fought on.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:08.160
Spencer, everybody.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.160
And again.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:16.160
I just remembered last week marked a milestone where we played D&D for like,

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.160
it seemed like 40 minutes at the end of it, Spencer was like,

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.160
you guys have to stop.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.160
It's gonna take a long time to kill that dragon.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.160
Which was kind of a, it was a milestone because we were engrossed.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.160
If you listen to the recording, we were like, we had finally stopped going like,

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:37.160
D&D, like we gotta make sure it stays on, you know, like Cliffhanger and Spencer was like,

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.160
you guys knock it off, go to bed.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:47.160
I thought that you were just expecting me to truncate the combat at the end of the session sort of thing.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.160
And I'm like, no, no, there's a dragon.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.160
So how many hits have we put on this dragon?

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:57.160
Let's see, I think you hit it once, sliced it in the neck, he took an arrow or two,

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:01.160
you shot him in the, between the eyes, I think, and it made him look kind of slim.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.160
He was in berserker rage and he did some stuff.

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.160
Yeah, and then, yeah, he hit him in a berserker rage and distracted him while you got in position.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.160
And then you went and tried to climb up a statue to jump off of it, but you failed the climb check.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.160
Right.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.160
You summoned a scorpion, didn't do much.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.160
Then you summoned another scorpion.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.160
Keith and David.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.160
Yeah, Keith and David.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:27.160
Right, so by popular demand, by popular hand wringing brow sweating demand,

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:31.160
check in with us about our hit points and get definitive for the people,

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.160
because they never know, people tweet me and they go,

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.160
I don't know when to be concerned that you guys are about to die.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.160
I don't know what's going on.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.160
We don't pay attention to that because we're a bunch of drunk performers.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.160
We never go, oh shit, I have three hit points.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.160
Yeah, it's true.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.160
Sharpie, right now you're at 24 hit points.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.160
Solid.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.160
Out of my 30.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.160
Yeah, that's like, you have like a smoker's hit points.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.160
Yeah.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.160
Yeah.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.160
It's not bad.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.160
You're okay.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.160
What's the range?

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.160
Well, you max out.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:08.160
Every time you level up, your maximum hit points go up.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.160
Like a video game.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.160
No, 24 solid.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.160
How many does Chris de Burgh have right now?

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.160
Chris de Burgh is sitting pretty at 43.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.160
I don't think he's gotten hit this whole time, to be honest.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.160
Yeah.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.160
Yeah.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.160
Mulraine has how many?

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160
Mulraine?

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.160
Yeah.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.160
Right now you have 35 on this.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160
Okay, cool.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.160
And I have a maximum of 51.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.160
I took a beating last time, didn't I?

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.160
Yeah, you're actually right now at 38.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.160
Oh, we're all doing pretty well.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.160
Not bad.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160
No, no.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.160
That's true.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.160
All right, so the dragon's still pacing the cage.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.160
And it's still got a numb dick, right?

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.160
The poison hasn't quite taken hold, but yeah.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.160
Yeah, it was in the dick.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.160
And I have two scorpions in here.

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160
Keith and David.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.160
Yeah.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.160
It's important.

01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:01.160
And I'm allowed to give them standing orders to attack the dragon.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.160
Yeah, sure.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.160
They'll go on your turn.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.160
I'll try to remember.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.160
What up?

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.160
I'm going to put it at Jeff's turn, unless anyone has any more questions.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.160
Have my far sword recharged?

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.160
No, it hasn't, in fact.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.160
And so can I do a flaming sword attack?

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.160
Yeah.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.160
All right, flaming sword attack.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.160
Flaming sword attack.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:29.160
With your flaming sword, you charge the dragon and slice towards his flesh, striking a quite decent blow at his chest.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160
Yeah, here we go.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.160
Dealing...

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.160
I'm bad.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.160
I hate my sword.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.160
Eleven damage.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:46.160
How much damage did you deal to yourself, then?

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:55.160
I'd say I lost a good three charisma points.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.160
You know?

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.160
All right, so we give this guy a lot of hit points.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.160
He's taking a beating.

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.160
Who's next?

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:05.160
Yeah, let's just go down this way and then I'll go.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.160
It'll be easier.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:15.160
In this area where we are, is it possible to climb up so we have an advantage from above?

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.160
There are those statues.

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.160
They're a good 15, 20 feet tall.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.160
You would be above him.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.160
Can I move silently up the statues?

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.160
Yeah, you can definitely try it, but it's pretty tricky to climb and be stealthy.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:34.160
So, you know, if your attention is split, it'll be a bit tougher than if you just tried to clamber up it.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.160
Okay, well, I wink at Sharpie and I try to climb up the statues.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.160
All right.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160
Is that two turns?

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.160
Well, I officially retire.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.160
The wink fails.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.160
Off the lumber, no number.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.160
Too high, no die.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.160
Yeah, sorry guys.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.160
Spencer's 20s had a die fell off the table.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.160
Yeah, for the podcast listeners.

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.160
That puts him at minus two for this dog leg right on the links.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:04.160
I mean, I guess you already rolled, but would it be too much to say I use the rope to climb up the statues?

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.160
Well, I would assume you'd use the rope in some fashion.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.160
Yeah, totally me too.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.160
Same page.

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.160
It's good you guys are on the same page.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:19.160
So, throwing the rope over the shoulder of the statue, you catch it and begin to try and hoist yourself up,

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.160
but the arm of the statue actually breaks off and falls down.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.160
You just...

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.160
I take my food sack and I empty it out on the ground.

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.160
That's a roll of a two, by the way, you know.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.160
Oh, that's right.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.160
For the listeners.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.160
Did the John Williams score go,

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:40.160
It's so frustrating watching those movies.

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.160
Blueballs.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.160
So is it me now?

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.160
Yeah, that'd be you.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.160
You're kind of lurking right now.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.160
Am I still stealthy right next to the dragon?

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:53.160
Yeah, he hasn't yet noticed you, but you know, he's a bit sluggish.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.160
Yeah, because of the dick stabbing.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.160
Yeah.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.160
That'll happen.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.160
He's not fucking anything soon.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.160
Or he has like great stamina, right?

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160
Yeah, okay.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160
Could go either way.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.160
Yeah.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:15.160
So do I have another poison dagger?

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.160
Yeah, you have a poison dagger.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.160
It's true.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:24.160
Can I just stab him in the same dick?

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:30.160
Go for a more vital part of him, like his head or his heart or something.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.160
How many dicks do dragons have?

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:36.160
This is a question I've been asking for years.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:42.160
How many dragons do you know?

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.160
That movie sucks.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:49.160
Just the one dick.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.160
Just the one dick.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.160
Where is it a good idea to stab the...

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.160
You know, wherever you can.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.160
You can't afford to be picky.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.160
Am I still close to the dick?

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.160
You're actually a good like 15 feet off at this point, you know.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.160
Get him in a major artery or a blood vessel or something.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.160
But I don't know where that would be.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.160
That's true, you wouldn't.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:16.160
Ah, guys, I'm just gonna play it safe and stab him in the dick.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.160
Go with what you know, Christopher.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.160
You are kind of a one hit one.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.160
Yeah, with everything.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.160
I know one thing and I just fucking go at it.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.160
I mean, I guess don't change your...

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.160
Stabbing, yeah.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:34.160
Stabbing in the dick is the dragon fighting version of Lady in Red.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.160
I'm sorry to think that a dragon dick hurt you in the past.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:44.160
Or just a dick that to him was larger when he was at a certain age.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:50.160
So as a rogue, you have the ability to sneak attack, which means if they're kind of unaware of you, you can do extra damage.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.160
So you want to go for that probably, right?

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:57.160
Yeah, and the good thing is his dick is already numb, so it'll do damage, but he won't know that I'm there.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.160
He'll just be bleeding out and he won't even know.

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.160
It's crazy.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:04.160
No, I'm enthusiastic about this twist.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.160
Honestly.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.160
I hope he isn't.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.160
I hope he isn't either.

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:15.160
Yeah, okay, striking him directly in the dick with a poison dagger.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.160
You score a seemingly nice cut.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.160
Score?

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.160
Yeah.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160
Score?

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:24.160
Nice cut.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:29.160
This is the funk break.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:35.160
I'm just pitching a music video right now of a dragon looking down at his numb dick.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:38.160
And there's like rose petals falling from the sky.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:42.160
Never seen a dragon have such a numb dick.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:46.160
Never seen an illa sing.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:50.160
After I stabbed it.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.160
So a pretty good slice?

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.160
Yeah, pretty good slice.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:59.160
You could tell the poison poured in to the phallus.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.160
So you got paralyzing poison.

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.160
You got that red poison, I think it was, the dagger.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.160
Guys, I'm doing great work there.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.160
Yes.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.160
Not bad.

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.160
Not bad at all.

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:15.160
But you also deal, ah, that's up.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.160
Jesus Christ.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.160
10 damage.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:20.160
It's like almost all the damage amounts have been 10 and 11 and it's weird.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.160
Is that low or high?

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.160
It's pretty solid, but it's just weird.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.160
It's like, I don't know, maybe rolling 7s, you know?

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160
Okay.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.160
2, 6s.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.160
We should go to Vegas.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.160
Yeah, let's do it.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160
Seriously.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.160
Spencer?

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.160
Me and you.

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.160
Yeah.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.160
Let's get this fucking MGM, let's get this fucking on.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.160
You know, I've never been to Vegas.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.160
We should go together.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.160
I've never been either.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.160
Let's all go.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.160
I don't want to go with you guys.

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.160
Alright.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:50.160
The city may never sleep, but I go to bed at night.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:56.160
Spencer and Jeff in Vegas is a movie I will wait to rent.

01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:01.160
Vegas Jam.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:07.160
Let's go to Vegas when Pearl Jam is playing next.

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.160
And bring Michael Jordan.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:16.160
Oh, the buffet is open from 3 p.m. and I'm lover.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:21.160
Have you seen the movie where it's the guy who goes off into the woods on his own and

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.160
basically dies?

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.160
Into the woods.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.160
What's it called?

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.160
Grizzly Man.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.160
Not Grizzly Man.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.160
Into the wild.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.160
Into the wild.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.160
Because it's this guy living on his own alone.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.160
And it's literally Eddie Vedder narrating what he's doing.

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:39.160
So he's literally Eddie Vedder like, today he made a shower.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.160
It's fucking awful anyway.

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.160
Don't you know that's a true story?

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.160
Yeah, I know.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.160
Well, that guy's an idiot.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.160
He genuinely is anyway.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.160
He was.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.160
We can jibber jabber all we want, but we have a dragon in the room.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.160
Sidebar.

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.160
How many monsters can I summon at one time?

01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:01.160
Two scorpions on the Scorp Deck.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:04.160
Yeah, you know, I think you can summon however many.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:08.160
But yeah, I mean, yeah, you can only do one order though.

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:13.160
So you have the standing orders to attack, but if you had four monsters, you couldn't

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.160
be like, you attack.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.160
No, no, no, I don't want to do different shit.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.160
I'm just saying, that's okay.

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:21.160
If I could keep summoning more scorpions every turn and having all those scorpions understand.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.160
Well, eventually you're going to run out of spells.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160
I think you got two more level two summons.

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:29.160
It's impossible for me to cast Ray of Frost and for one of us to shatter him like with

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.160
a sword attack and like take off a leg.

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:35.160
If it froze him, yeah, but I mean it's not very much damage.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:40.160
Can you call the next ones Dennis and Haysbert?

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.160
I'm going to let Keith and David do their thing.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.160
I'm going to spend this turn trying to do something a little more.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:48.160
No, no, no, I don't mean I'm passing.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.160
I know.

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.160
I'm rolling Keith and David.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.160
You roll.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.160
They're attacking, you know, like you had ordered.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:59.160
I want to know about Tasha's hideous laugh again.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.160
Yeah, so that's a spell.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.160
That's a charm spell that if they fail, they will save.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:10.160
You know, they lose their action because they're doubled over.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.160
Might it work on a large reptile?

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:19.160
I mean, dragons in general are pretty hard to charm, but yeah, it would if you rolled poorly.

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:27.160
Tasha's hideous laughter.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.160
What's he doing?

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.160
I think he's taking leprechaun in the hood.

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.160
Yeah.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:37.160
Oh, he don't play that.

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.160
Pot of gold.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.160
You guys hang out with this guy like all the time?

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:48.160
You say as you're staring at a dragon stick.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.160
What a weirdo.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:52.160
Anyway, I'm going to continue stabbing this dick.

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.160
He does.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.160
He does pass his will save, so he's unaffected.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.160
All right.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.160
Well, Keith, David.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.160
Did that do anything?

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.160
The singing?

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.160
No.

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.160
But it was worth a shot.

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.160
Let my scorpions do their thing.

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.160
The scorpions attack.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.160
David doesn't manage to strike the high.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.160
However.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.160
Why is this happening?

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:23.160
However, Keith deals a wicked blow to the back left leg of the dragon, dealing eight damage.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.160
That's not bad.

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:28.160
You basically chipped its nail.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.160
So right now the dragon has a numb dick, right?

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:32.160
Yeah.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.160
How big is the dick?

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:35.160
How big is the dick?

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.160
How big is the dragon's dick?

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.160
How big is your dick?

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.160
Is your dick is so big?

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:42.160
I really need to know.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.160
I'm really, I'm really crunching.

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.160
I'm living in a world.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.160
I'm taking this as seriously as you are now.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.160
Breaking me down.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.160
Huh?

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.160
Is it bigger than a bread box?

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.160
Yeah.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.160
Is it numb?

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160
I'm small.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.160
Can I crawl up inside his dick hole?

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.160
What?

01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.160
Jeff.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.160
I can kill him on the inside.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.160
What?

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.160
I'll take my sword.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.160
I'll climb up his dick.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.160
It's numb.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.160
He won't know.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.160
Can I?

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.160
Can I squeeze into the dick hole and get inside his abdomen?

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.160
I'll just smash it and fucking.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.160
And I'm like, I should have thought of that.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.160
This is how I fight.

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.160
Is it too small for me to climb inside?

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.160
Yeah.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.160
It's like, I mean, maybe the size of an elephant.

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:26.160
Like, he can't climb up an elephant's dick.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.160
Yeah.

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.160
Like, maybe it's asshole.

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:32.160
What if I go up to his dick and I hold it open and I have Mulrainee come behind him.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.160
I have her shoot arrows into his dick hole.

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.160
What?

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.160
I'm just trying to kill a dragon.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.160
That would be exceedingly dangerous.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.160
You know what I mean?

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.160
Right.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160
Maybe.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.160
Maybe?

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.160
I mean, technically, it's possible to hold open something.

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.160
Okay.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.160
Because I have fast movement.

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.160
I say, Psst, Mulrainee.

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.160
I'm going to run up using my fast, sneaky dwarf.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.160
Let me run this by you, Mulrainee.

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.160
My gnome.

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.160
This is a tough sell.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:57.160
Yeah.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.160
You don't have to do it.

01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.160
I'm taking all the risk here.

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:02.160
I want you just to get two of your favorite arrows handy.

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.160
And I'm going to run up real quick, grab his numb dick, open it up, and I'm going to aim

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.160
it towards you.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.160
And I want you to shoot as many arrows as you can into his dick hole.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.160
Am I still hanging out by the dick?

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.160
Be careful.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.160
Don't hit me.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.160
Hit the dick.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:21.160
I'll agree to this if only we can talk about what this means after.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.160
I'm trying to kill a dragon.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.160
I can discuss it.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.160
That's trying to make sense to me.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.160
All we've done so far is numb this guy's dick.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:30.160
I'm taking advantage of a breach in the armor right now.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:33.160
All we've done, all I've done.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.160
You've been trying to climb a statue.

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:39.160
I'm trying to stand on the shoulders of your hard work.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.160
Dude, we're all on the same team.

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:46.160
All I'm saying is that I quirk and Chris, we should examine this a little bit more afterwards.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.160
And an impetuous gnome barbarian in the state of mind.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.160
I run up.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.160
I say, just do what you want to do.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.160
I'm going to go open that dick hole.

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.160
And I run up.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:00.160
And I grab the dragon's numb dick and I open it up and I aim it at her like a fire hose.

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.160
And I go, shoot your arrows!

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.160
Why would arrows open it up?

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.160
No, no, no.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.160
He opens it up.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.160
I need my hands to open it up.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.160
I'm giving her a target size.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.160
The gesture you're making is very flattering to the dragon.

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.160
I don't know how big a dragon's dick is.

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.160
I bet it's not as big as, I mean, that's like a post office box.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.160
What a weird, my dick looks weird.

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.160
I'm opening it up to a mailbox size.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.160
The size of a mailbox.

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.160
Can you hit a mailbox?

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.160
Hey, what's up, dude?

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.160
I'm right next to the dick still.

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.160
Hey, what are you doing?

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.160
Chris, step a little over to the side.

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.160
Okay.

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.160
Yeah, this is a bad place to be right now.

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:40.160
Are you opening the dick hole to get arrows in?

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.160
Yes.

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.160
Oh, you're going for the number three?

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.160
Yeah.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.160
So I'm standing there holding a dragon's dick open.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.160
Okay.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:54.160
I bet you've never said that sentence before.

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.160
So before that quite happens, the dragon attacks.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:04.160
You told me his dick was numb, DeBurg.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:07.160
Yeah, he did his own attacking with his dick.

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.160
He has.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.160
I was trying to, I didn't want to get into a big conversation.

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.160
I wanted to use my fast move and open the dick, get an arrow in there and run the fuck over.

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:22.160
I think we're all safe here, convened around his dick, because God knows if a dragon could attack us here, he wouldn't leave the house.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:29.160
Hey, oh, judging snap.

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.160
Wait, so who does he attack?

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.160
Probably me.

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:37.160
Well, he attacks Keith, you know, and he, oh good.

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.160
Yeah, that's fine.

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.160
Let me just narrate this.

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.160
We're okay with that.

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:50.160
Rearing back and striking with his front claw, he pins down the scorpion before biting its head with his fearsome beak, ripping it from its shoulders.

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:52.160
Do scorpions have shoulders?

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.160
Yes.

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.160
Ripping it from its shoulders.

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.160
It got like eight.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.160
Yeah, they got a bunch of shoulders.

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.160
At the same time.

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.160
Its survival instinct is terrible, by the way.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:02.160
He's not going for the guy opening his dick.

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:05.160
Chronologically, that hasn't happened yet.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.160
Oh, shit.

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.160
At least he had to happen.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:17.160
With both of his wings, he flails them wildly and his left wing catches Christopher right in the chin, knocking you off your feet onto your back.

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:21.160
Oh, my mouth is my fortune.

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:26.160
Keith!

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.160
But now, this is the perfect time.

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.160
Christopher is now cleared out of the way.

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.160
He's distracted with scorpion shoulders.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:42.160
So now I've run up, opened up his dick hole, and cried out to Mulraine to shoot some arrows into this dragon's dick for Pete's sake.

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:48.160
Approaching the dragon, he points his beak at you and then does something like a pack attack.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:56.160
How about, you know, rearing back like a cobra, he lunges forward, striking you directly in the chest with his beak.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:05.160
It pings harmlessly off your armor, and you manage to position yourself right under his, you know, dickle regions.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.160
I think the dickle regions are just called dick.

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:16.160
Positioning yourself strategically around the dick, you force your hands into the opening, whiting the urethra.

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:23.160
You call out to your compatriot, Mulraine, who is somewhat conflicted by this whole thing, it seems.

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:24.160
It's fine, it's fine.

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:26.160
Okay, well, that's just what I'm reading off your face.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:28.160
Can I ask, how much did that get hurt?

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:31.160
You got hurt for, what did I, I said five damage, right?

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.160
Four damage.

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:36.160
I mean, I'm just, I'm guessing, well, no, remember, I was going to say the dumbest thing in the world.

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:39.160
I just, I can't help but just picture a giant penis.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:42.160
I was about to say I've had more experience with penises than you guys have, that's retarded.

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.160
You all have penises.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.160
I experience one every day.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.160
Right.

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:52.160
How much experience do you have with my retarded sister?

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.160
All right, cliffhanger.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:58.160
We'll come back and see how we break that out.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.160
Cha-ching.

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:02.160
Am I going to stand here holding a dragon's dick open for the rest of the day?

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:05.160
Somebody shoot an arrow for pity's sake.

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:11.160
I shoot two V arrows into the dragon's urethra.

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.160
Okay.

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.160
Now we're talking.

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:15.160
Retardedly.

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.160
Now we're playing D&D.

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.160
I don't get the connection.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.160
What are you talking about?

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.160
Did somebody use that word?

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:21.160
Yeah.

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:22.160
Oh, retarded.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.160
Yes, great.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.160
Okay.

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.160
We're supposed to be phasing that out.

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:29.160
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't like that term.

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:30.160
I'm sorry.

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:31.160
I'm sorry I said retarded.

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.160
Dan has it.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.160
Don't you keep saying it.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:38.160
Well, I meant retarded in an inefficient way.

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:40.160
You meant like gay.

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:46.160
I meant that the devil chose you because your parents committed a sin.

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:53.160
Generally, nothing is gayer than shooting an arrow into a dude's penis.

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:55.160
I'm very sorry I said retarded.

01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:58.160
In my mind, I pictured this whole thing to go down a lot faster.

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:03.160
You know, I would spend seven minutes holding a dragon's penis hole open.

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:06.160
Now I'm getting, it's getting a little gay over here.

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:09.160
I shot two, I shot two V arrows.

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.160
Yeah, both of them missed.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:12.160
Oh.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.160
Oh, you retarded.

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:14.160
You got it, aren't I?

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:17.160
A huge retard.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:23.160
So, I look up at the dragon and give him like a sorry.

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:27.160
And I run back to my friend and go like, you guys did fucking little less gibber jabber

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.160
next time.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:35.160
I take some gold coins and I put them in an envelope and I mail them to the Special Olympics.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:37.160
I don't know how to get out of it.

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:39.160
You're gonna do this retarded sister out there.

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.160
A good way is to...

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.160
Stop pulling back into it.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:44.160
Yeah, a good way is to not talk about it anymore.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.160
You're forgiven.

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.160
Just let's keep going.

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.160
It's fine.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:52.160
I cast a spell to protect myself from the awkwardness in this battle chamber.

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.160
I absolve everyone.

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.160
I have a bubble.

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.160
All right, so it's my turn?

01:33:58.160 --> 01:33:59.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:02.160
You've been knocked onto your feet, so, you know, you have to get up before...

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.160
I get up.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.160
I walk over.

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.160
I open...

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.160
I hold its dick hole open and I yell at Maldred.

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.160
Try again!

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.160
There we go.

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.160
You can do it!

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.160
Approaching.

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:15.160
No, no, no.

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:16.160
I don't.

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:19.160
I don't think she's on board.

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:26.160
So, I have a... I can... a short bow sap? What does sap do?

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.160
A sap's like a blackjack.

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:30.160
It's like, you know, like a donkey sock.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.160
Like...

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.160
Like a what?

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:33.160
A donkey sock.

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.160
A donkey sock?

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.160
What are these words?

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.160
Like, okay.

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:40.160
So, have you ever, like, filled, like, a bag with coins?

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.160
Oh, it's like that?

01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:43.160
Like, it was really full of, like...

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:44.160
And then, like...

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.160
Is it spiky?

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.160
No, like, it's just really heavy, but you can like...

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.160
It's like, it's a...

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.160
It's like you knock something out with the back of the head with.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:51.160
Yeah.

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:52.160
A blackjack, you know.

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.160
Okay.

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.160
You keep saying, oh, blackjack.

01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.160
No, I don't know what...

01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:00.160
I don't know in this context what it means.

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:03.160
So, I have a blackjack that saps energy?

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.160
No, it's just also called a sap.

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.160
That's like a weird thing.

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.160
Imagine a piece of leather...

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.160
Oh, guys, shut up.

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:15.160
I... I use the blackjack on the dick.

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.160
Fair... Yeah.

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.160
Oh, what am I going on here?

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.160
You strike directly in the dick.

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.160
However, he doesn't seem to take notice as it is numb.

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:24.160
Yes.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.160
But it hurts him, right?

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:29.160
I mean, the sap does non-lethal damage, so he can't feel it, so...

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:30.160
Have you said it enough?

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:35.160
Eventually, he'd go unconscious and not know why.

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.160
I do it enough.

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.160
But you do do seven damage.

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.160
So, overall, the dragon is hurt.

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:44.160
He's been hurt, yeah, although he wouldn't know it.

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.160
But seven... Okay, the knowing is not important to me.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:49.160
I'm not doing this because I want the dragon to know

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.160
I'm attacking its dick over and over.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:54.160
That is the last thing I want the dragon to know.

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:57.160
That is why I numbed its dick.

01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.160
That was step one.

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.160
I don't want to announce to this dragon,

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:03.160
hey, I have a bunch of things in my bag.

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.160
I'm going to pull them out one by one.

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:09.160
And I'm going to strike your dick with it.

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:13.160
You numbed its dick so you could hit it with a bag filled with corn.

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:16.160
Hey, that wasn't the first thing I did.

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.160
I'm just looking in my bag.

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.160
I don't know what else I have.

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.160
Some dragons pay a lot of money for this kind of stuff.

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:26.160
Am I causing the dragon any pleasure?

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:29.160
Is that what kind of dungeon this is?

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:32.160
This is like a weird sex dungeon.

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.160
Judges and dragons are just a bunch of...

01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:37.160
It's just a weird domination dungeon for dragons to go to.

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:40.160
Well, it does say I'm a rogue, so...

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.160
Have you ever googled Dungeon Master?

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:46.160
Of course.

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.160
Ready for my move?

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.160
Oh, yeah.

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:54.160
Oh, shit, I have like a wire saw and stuff.

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:56.160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:59.160
Like you could cut a limb off a branch.

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.160
Oh, you could probably saw the dick off.

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:03.160
That would take a while, but yeah.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:06.160
I think someone said that from the back.

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.160
Hey, guys, I think I got my next turn planned out.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.160
Here's what I'm doing.

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.160
Because I know what I'm doing,

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:17.160
and I've seen a lot of movies where you're fighting an oversized beast.

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:21.160
I'm casting the spell Jump,

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:25.160
and I am leaping onto the dragon's back.

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:28.160
Why? That's not where it's dick is.

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:33.160
It's where my hero medal is.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:36.160
Oh, that's what the brain is.

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.160
Yeah, there's lethal parts of the body.

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:42.160
It's time to get cinematic.

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.160
Alright.

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.160
Jump.

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.160
Casting Jump on yourself.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.160
You feel arcane energy swirling around your legs.

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:54.160
You get the sensation that you can jump powerfully for a time.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:57.160
I do so!

01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.160
Onto the back of the dragon?

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.160
Yes!

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:02.160
Heroically leaping up into the air,

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:05.160
you land cinematically on the back of the dragon,

01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.160
and you successfully...

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:09.160
for a bit you feel unsteady,

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:12.160
but then you catch yourself and you have sturdy footing.

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.160
That guy's awesome.

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:17.160
That's way better than the laughing attack you did.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.160
Letterbox appears.

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.160
Can I do more? Is that my whole turn?

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.160
Uh, yeah, that is your whole turn.

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.160
Yeah!

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:31.160
I take my great sword and I throw it up to him

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:34.160
so he can punch the sword.

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:36.160
You should tell him when you're doing it.

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.160
I say, look alive!

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.160
And I throw it, handle first, up to Sharpie,

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:46.160
so he can plunge my sword into the back of the spinal column,

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:49.160
like a coup de gras in a bullfight.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.160
But not before the sluggishly poisoned dragon

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.160
unleashes an acid line onto your party.

01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:00.160
It flows directly into Quark's path, as well as Moran's path,

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:03.160
and you'll have to twist yourselves out of the way to dodge.

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.160
I have a good dodging ability, don't I?

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.160
That's true.

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:08.160
I can jump, I can dodge, I'm very nimble.

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.160
You can dodge.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:13.160
So, yeah, but you didn't in this case.

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.160
Sometimes it's just not your day.

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:20.160
Yeah, sometimes it's just not your day.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:24.160
I was two arrows up a dick all the way from finishing this thing.

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:27.160
Two arrows at a dick, two girls, one.

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:31.160
Sometimes you gnome and open up a dragon dick.

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:34.160
Sometimes the dragon dick opens up you.

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:39.160
Oh, yeah, we all grew up with that thing.

01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:44.160
So, Moran takes 16 damage from the line of acid

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:47.160
and then his corrosive juices burn through her armor and onto the stick.

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:49.160
I know why.

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.160
Because it's acid.

01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:53.160
Well, and because I said retarded earlier.

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:57.160
No, because you were half of America.

01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:59.160
Is my awkwardness shield still up?

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.160
That's what they always...

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.160
That's a true standards and practices thing.

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:08.160
They go like, oh, can Annie get drunk,

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.160
even though she's underage,

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:11.160
and they're like, as long as she has a bad time.

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.160
Oh, really?

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:13.160
It's so crazy.

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:17.160
Yeah, just let there be negative consequences to their foolish actions.

01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:19.160
That's like a lot of horror movie stuff.

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:21.160
It's all very, like, morality.

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.160
Yeah, can these two do it?

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:23.160
Can we see your boobs?

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.160
Yeah, if you murder them afterwards.

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.160
Yeah, then you murder them.

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.160
How many hit points do I take, Spencer?

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.160
You also take 16.

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:32.160
Shit, I'm getting screwed over here.

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:35.160
By my count, you're at 26, I think.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.160
Maybe you've got...

01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.160
No, you should have taken another eight damage, right?

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.160
So it should be 18.

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.160
Yeah.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:43.160
Well, I take a healing potion.

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:45.160
Okay, well, you were gonna...

01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:48.160
Okay, so you could take a healing potion and throw the sword,

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:49.160
but that's all you could do.

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:50.160
Is that cool?

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:51.160
Yeah.

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.160
Yeah, okay, so...

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:54.160
Swilling a healing potion in a single gulp

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.160
and hurling your sword directly at a Sharpie Buttsalot.

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.160
Shit, critical.

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:01.160
So, yeah, you catch it and, like,

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.160
you throw it in, like, a super dramatic manner

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.160
and it's all slow motion style,

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.160
and it cuts to people, like, looking at it, you know?

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.160
Right.

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.160
And it totally lands perfectly in your hand.

01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.160
In my hand?

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.160
Oh!

01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.160
And there's almost, like, energy kind of, like,

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.160
you know, surrounding this whole epic situation,

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:20.160
as it lands directly into your hand perfectly.

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:23.160
And also you gain 14 hit points.

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.160
So he gains back 14 hit points.

01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:27.160
Oh, sweet.

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.160
But also you have the thing now.

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.160
Yeah, so you got my sword now.

01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.160
Use it, Jackson.

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.160
Well, is it your turn?

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:34.160
It's yours, right?

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.160
My turn.

01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.160
Mulroin.

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.160
Let's see.

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:41.160
Well, first of all, I'm sorry about saying retarded.

01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.160
I was just joking.

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:43.160
The arrow's just missed.

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.160
Well, I know, but I don't know.

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:46.160
It's just a joke gone bad.

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:47.160
It happens all the time.

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.160
Yeah, I'm gonna go on a message board

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:51.160
and there's gonna be a photoshop on my face

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:52.160
covered in blood.

01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:53.160
I don't know.

01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:56.160
Um, I'm not asking for that, by the way.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.160
Too late.

01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:59.160
Okay, I take, sorry.

01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:00.160
Too late.

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.160
It's gonna, it's already happening.

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:02.160
I know.

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:04.160
Yeah, it's already, if you go to YouTube,

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.160
it'll be there right now.

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:06.160
I'm sure this is very annoying,

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:08.160
but it's clear that I, I'm sorry.

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.160
I didn't mean it.

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:10.160
No, you, you, you've paid your penance.

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.160
It was a joke.

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:12.160
I know, I know.

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.160
The language is garbage.

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:16.160
The sounds that come out of people's mouths.

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.160
I know one hates the idea

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.160
that you can't say retarded more than me.

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.160
I was doing a bit.

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:22.160
I, I did a, I did that to you.

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:23.160
I'm sorry.

01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:26.160
I got my, I got my shitty retarded joke all over you.

01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:27.160
I'm sorry.

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.160
Like that was my bit that didn't land

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.160
and made your plane crash.

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:33.160
I imagine you're doing the topology

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.160
with a sword in your hand.

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.160
So I take, I take two V arrows.

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.160
Sure.

01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:45.160
And I shoot them at the dragon.

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:47.160
I sh, what?

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.160
What?

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:49.160
Don't.

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:50.160
What?

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.160
Nothing.

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:52.160
I thought you were whispering at me at him.

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.160
Okay.

01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:57.160
I take two V arrows and I shoot them at the dragon's head.

01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:58.160
At his head.

01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:59.160
He's right there.

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.160
Right.

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.160
But I can't handle my arrows.

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:05.160
No, but I want to make sure you don't, don't hit him.

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:06.160
She won't hit me.

01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.160
I guess I'm too reliant on my skill.

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:11.160
I shoot them at the, at the, at the dragon's belly.

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.160
At the dragon's belly, huh?

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:14.160
Or his heart.

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:17.160
At his heart, huh?

01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:19.160
You said earlier that the dragon's organs

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:21.160
are different from regular organs.

01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:22.160
Yeah.

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.160
They have like, you know, they got like, you know,

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.160
numb dicks.

01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:27.160
This one has acid bladders, you know,

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.160
to hold acid so he could spit it out.

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:32.160
You know, you don't have that.

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:33.160
They're different.

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.160
It's different.

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.160
Anyway, arrows hit, both of them hit.

01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.160
Um, you deal 13 damage altogether.

01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:43.160
Striking them directly in the neck with both arrow shots.

01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.160
Nice.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.160
The neck.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.160
He's a bit, he's a bit woozy right now.

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.160
He's on the ropes.

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:48.160
We've been kicking this guy's ass.

01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:49.160
The dragons are tough, you guys.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.160
Yeah, I know.

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:51.160
I know.

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:52.160
Okay.

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.160
Yeah.

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:54.160
Um, all right.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.160
Christopher.

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:58.160
It also says I have a bear trap like in cartoons.

01:43:58.160 --> 01:43:59.160
Yeah.

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:03.160
Like, see, because your character is also like a

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:04.160
trapsman.

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.160
Yeah.

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:06.160
Traps and stuff.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.160
Fucking throw that thing on the dick.

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:13.160
It seems so obvious now.

01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.160
You guys, watch this.

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:16.160
Yeah.

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.160
He's not going to feel it.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:20.160
And I have a great singer.

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.160
Oh, you?

01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:22.160
Yeah.

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.160
All right.

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:26.160
More like dick trap.

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:28.160
I can only write songs.

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:29.160
Right.

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:30.160
Song.

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:31.160
But it doesn't.

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:34.160
Your bear drop trap goes off as expected.

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:36.160
Grin and bear it.

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:37.160
That's it.

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:38.160
That's a good one.

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:39.160
Oh God.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:40.160
That's grizzly.

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.160
Um.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.160
Of me too.

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.160
Yeah.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:48.160
It's quite grizzly of me too.

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:51.160
That doesn't feel like honey.

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:54.160
You're really dragging it out.

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:55.160
Yeah.

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:56.160
Yeah.

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:59.160
Hey boo boo.

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:00.160
Boo boo boo.

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:04.160
I got a boo boo on my hand.

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.160
Yeah.

01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:09.160
So the bear trap works as intended.

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:13.160
It finishes the job that your poison, you know, daggers started.

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:14.160
Wait.

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:15.160
Okay.

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:16.160
I have a quick question.

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:17.160
Yeah.

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:20.160
Does this mean, is this like, am I helping it by severing the organ that is poisoned?

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.160
Yes.

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:25.160
Well, at this point, the poison would have already worked its way into the system.

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.160
But, but I mean, you, you, there's not more dick poison going to go into them.

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:30.160
Definitely not.

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:31.160
Yeah.

01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:33.160
I mean, you could have thrown it in his mouth and maybe like.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:37.160
Guys have good news and bad news.

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:41.160
Does anybody want like a dragon dick?

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:45.160
I put it in my sack just, just in case.

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.160
Yeah.

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:49.160
You know, they got the magical, magical dicks.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:55.160
If you, if you're on the market for a dragon dick, there's an old legend that severed dragon

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:58.160
penises are really good at helping you write songs.

01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.160
Yeah.

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:00.160
Yeah.

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.160
Yeah.

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:06.160
But you have to put it in your mouth.

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:11.160
This won't be the first one I've put in my mouth.

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:12.160
Yeah.

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:13.160
That's amazing.

01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:14.160
That is a legend, right?

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:15.160
It's a legend.

01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:16.160
All right.

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.160
So Sharpie, it's your turn.

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:18.160
Please go.

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:19.160
Yeah.

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:20.160
You got my sword.

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:21.160
I got his sword.

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:24.160
You still, you still carrying the dramatic motion of the toss that comes to you.

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.160
Yeah.

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.160
And everything goes quiet.

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:29.160
And I go, father.

01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.160
And then thrust down.

01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:34.160
Did he just say father?

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.160
Yeah, I just said father.

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:36.160
Fuck.

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:41.160
I don't think he's slaying that dragon.

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:45.160
Planting the blade directly between the, do dragons have shoulders?

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:46.160
Everything has shoulders.

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.160
Between the shoulder blades of the dragon's back.

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:52.160
The blade slices cleanly through the spinal cord.

01:46:52.160 --> 01:47:01.160
And the dragon goes limp.

01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:02.160
Wow.

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:06.160
That really puts my dick strategy into question.

01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:09.160
My mother just made a bathtub.

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.160
What?

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.160
What?

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.160
You had a breakthrough.

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.160
I'm sorry.

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:17.160
I must have dreamt something.

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:18.160
Yeah.

01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:19.160
Yeah.

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:20.160
Is the dragon alive?

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:21.160
No, it's dead.

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.160
I go up and everybody, it's dead.

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.160
We killed the dragon.

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:25.160
Yeah.

01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:26.160
Yeah.

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:27.160
Yeah.

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.160
I'm a father.

01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:35.160
I take one of my burnt sticks and draw dicks and balls to live with the dragon's face.

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:39.160
I draw swastikas on his balls and dicks on his face.

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.160
You're ruining the market value of that dragon height.

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.160
Oh, shit.

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:45.160
I don't give a fuck for dragon height.

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:47.160
Oh, dragon height is marketable?

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.160
Well, yeah.

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:49.160
Everything dragon is marketable.

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:50.160
Oh.

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.160
Including what I got.

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.160
Yeah.

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.160
All right.

01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:54.160
Thank you.

01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:55.160
Camille, everybody.

01:47:55.160 --> 01:48:00.160
Erin McGathy, Spencer Crintenden.

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:02.160
That's not even a close-finger.

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:05.160
We just slayed a dragon.

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:07.160
That's how you do it.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:09.160
Well done, sir.

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:12.160
Chris de Burgh, I doubted your tactics, but we know.

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:15.160
All's well that ends well.

01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:20.160
Send your letters to Erin McGathy and Erin McGathy at IHateRetardedPeople.com.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:23.160
Which is a weird e-mail address for her to pick.

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.160
Seems like she was asking for it.

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.160
But it's also a weird place to send emails.

01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:30.160
Yeah, so it's a website.

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.160
There's a contact page on that website.

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:36.160
Why did you come here if you didn't expect to get offended?

01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:38.160
That's another problem with the internet culture.

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:39.160
People seeking out offense.

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.160
All right, Dan, we've gone long.

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.160
Let's bring this fucker into the station.

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.160
What do you think?

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.160
Let's do it on a dime.

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:44.160
On a dime.

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:45.160
Ten cents.

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:46.160
Ten cents?

01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:47.160
Straight up.

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.160
What do you want, Herman?

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:51.160
Give me something sexy.

01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:52.160
You want something sexy?

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.160
Yep.

01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:54.160
All right.

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:55.160
You got something for us?

01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:56.160
No.

01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:58.160
When did I ever have something?

01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.160
I sat on it for two hours.

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.160
Now I have something?

01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:02.160
I don't know.

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:04.160
Do you want to connect with the crowd first?

01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:05.160
Do you want to just say goodnight?

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.160
Do you want to bid these people a fond farewell?

01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.160
Well, how do you connect with them by talking to them?

01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:10.160
They're all sleepy.

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.160
Like, if I go, what's your name, Sarah?

01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:13.160
And I'll go, Lunard?

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.160
And I'll go, what's your problem?

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.160
And he'll go, I'm sleepy.

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:23.160
I live in Rancho, the salad.

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:25.160
Did anybody here particularly feel like they learned something

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:27.160
or take something away from tonight?

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.160
Does anybody feel like they've grown as a person?

01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:31.160
They may have got a big, big, big, big problem

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:35.160
that you came in here with, that you really need solved.

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:37.160
See, that takes a lot of guts and fortitude for them.

01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.160
They're stonewalling us.

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.160
They're like, no, the show's over.

01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:42.160
Get out of here.

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:43.160
That's good.

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.160
We had a perfect, perfect little show.

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:47.160
We'll just need to...

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.160
It doesn't need to be long.

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.160
Just make it short and sweet, mind you.

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.160
Put a little cherry on top of this beautiful Sunday

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.160
we've created for these people.

01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.160
Okay, alright.

01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:06.160
I killed a dragon with you

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.160
We fought a monster or two

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:17.160
We're gonna do it in Harmontown

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.160
We watched horror movies

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.160
and everything

01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:25.160
It's stupid. I don't like this.

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.160
You know the problem with that song, the whole tour?

01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.160
It's like, I don't like the structure of the...

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.160
because you wait for the beat and then the thing...

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.160
and then it picks up...

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:38.160
I don't know how to articulate the corner that that song...

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:40.160
articulate it then, sing it.

01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:44.160
I'm trying to tell you that I can't to that song.

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.160
Don't tell me you can't sing, sing, but you can't.

01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:48.160
To that song.

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:50.160
Okay, okay, alright.

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:52.160
Fight through it, man.

01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:55.160
It's weird to sing to a song

01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:58.160
that doesn't have a beginning or end.

01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:02.160
Now it's going quiet for a second.

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:06.160
It's just my job to have to reckon with it.

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:09.160
In Harmontown, and it doesn't...

01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:12.160
you don't, there's no...

01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:15.160
there's nothing to do with the song.

01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:17.160
Everything comes out wrong.

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:19.160
You're still creating a song.

01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:20.160
It's a song.

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:23.160
Sometimes the limitations of the genre

01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:25.160
liberate the creative mind.

01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:28.160
Yo, I fucked your mama at five.

01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:30.160
Yeah, use the limitations.

01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:32.160
It made me feel alive.

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:37.160
Her pussy gave me the jive to carry on

01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:39.160
in Harmontown.

01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:42.160
I fucked your mama a lot.

01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.160
I made her cry.

01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:46.160
It's not...

01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:49.160
She looked sick to the neighborhood.

01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:51.160
They brought her in and said,

01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:53.160
stupid scum.

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:56.160
Oh, front corner.

01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.160
Front corner.

01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:59.160
We're going to end it at a front corner.

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:02.160
Front corner.

01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:04.160
Front corner.

01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:07.160
Front, front, front corner.

01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:09.160
Y'all...

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:11.160
Breakdown. Mama's in the kitchen.

01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:13.160
Fuck your mama said, stop that bitchin'.

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:15.160
Put my dick in her eye and her mouth.

01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:18.160
Northwest, south, south, south.

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:20.160
Fuck your mama on the floor.

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:22.160
Fuck your mama like Eva Gabor.

01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:25.160
Fuck your mama in the attic in the basement.

01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:28.160
Fuck your mama said, this is a case that's closed.

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:31.160
Fuck your mama like sisters and bros.

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.160
Fuck your mama up and down the street.

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.160
Fuck your mama with my hand and my feet.

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:38.160
Fuck your mama on a big snow plow.

01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:40.160
Fuck your mama and I don't know how.

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:42.160
It boggles me. I tried to figure it out.

01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:45.160
Fuck your mama, but I don't have the clout.

01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:47.160
Went to City Hall, asked the mayor.

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.160
Can I fuck your mom? He said, she's over there.

01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:52.160
Went over to her, fucked her again.

01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:54.160
Fuck your mama, eight, nine, ten.

01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:56.160
Fuck your mama up in the air.

01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:58.160
Fuck your mama, I don't care.

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:01.160
Fuck your mama, cut my hair.

01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:04.160
Fuck your mama, dragon's lair.

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.160
Fuck your mama.

01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:07.160
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:09.160
We did it again.

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:11.160
One more time for Spencer Grintenden, please.

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:14.160
Erin McGathy, Kumail Nanjiani.

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:16.160
Everybody here at Meltdown Commerce.

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:20.160
Brian W. Collins and horror movie a day.

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:22.160
Thank you, Shannon, for coming up earlier.

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:24.160
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:26.160
And for Dan Harmon, your Mayor.

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:56.160
Thank you.

01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:26.160
Thank you.

01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:56.160
Thank you.

01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:26.160
Thank you.

01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:56.160
Thank you.

01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:26.160
Thank you.

01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:56.160
Thank you.

01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:26.160
Thank you.

01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:56.160
Thank you.

01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:26.160
Thank you.

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.160
Thank you.

01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:26.160
Thank you.

01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:56.160
Thank you.

02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:26.160
Thank you.

02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:56.160
Thank you.

02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:26.160
Thank you.

02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:56.160

02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:26.160
Thank you.
