WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.380
Thank you.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.220
Thank you.

00:05.220 --> 00:07.220
Yeah!

00:07.220 --> 00:09.220
Whoo!

00:09.220 --> 00:11.220
Whoo!

00:11.220 --> 00:13.220
Whoo!

00:13.220 --> 00:15.220
Whoo!

00:15.220 --> 00:17.220
Whoo!

00:17.220 --> 00:19.220
Whoo!

00:19.220 --> 00:21.220
Whoo!

00:21.220 --> 00:23.220
Whoo!

00:23.220 --> 00:25.220
Whoo!

00:25.220 --> 00:27.220
Just for fun.

00:27.220 --> 00:42.220
Ba-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

00:42.220 --> 00:45.220
Some people call me Pringles Dick,

00:45.220 --> 00:49.220
but I never really found out why I'm boo-doo-doo.

00:49.220 --> 00:52.220
I don't really have a Pringles Dick.

00:52.220 --> 00:56.220
I just keep my dick inside.

00:56.220 --> 01:04.220
I keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis safe and dry.

01:04.220 --> 01:11.220
Some people call me Pringles dick, but I never really found out.

01:11.220 --> 01:14.220
I never really found out why.

01:14.220 --> 01:26.220
Harmontown is now in session.

01:26.220 --> 01:38.220
Brandon Johnson.

01:38.220 --> 02:03.220
Rob Schrab.

02:03.220 --> 02:14.220
Spencer Crittenden.

02:14.220 --> 02:24.220
And just for good fun, Oakham Open Mike Eagle.

02:24.220 --> 02:51.220
That other guy, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

02:51.220 --> 02:55.220
This is it. The last fucking Harmontown. We did it.

02:55.220 --> 02:58.220
Seven years of sadness.

02:58.220 --> 03:02.220
Wow.

03:02.220 --> 03:05.220
Where's the music? There was no music.

03:05.220 --> 03:07.220
I sing a song.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.220
Yeah, you did acapella.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.220
He wants to do his mama rap.

03:11.220 --> 03:13.220
No, no, no. I don't want to.

03:13.220 --> 03:15.220
Zach put a beat on so Dan can have some music.

03:15.220 --> 03:19.220
I haven't done mama raps ever since Mike taught me to stay off of that crutch.

03:19.220 --> 03:21.220
That's right.

03:21.220 --> 03:23.220
Is that true? I think you did.

03:23.220 --> 03:25.220
That is not true.

03:25.220 --> 03:27.220
That is not true.

03:27.220 --> 03:30.220
There's 80 mamas out there right now, picketing.

03:30.220 --> 03:32.220
Waiting to be fucked.

03:32.220 --> 03:35.220
Zach, you got some music, Zach?

03:35.220 --> 03:37.220
All right.

03:37.220 --> 03:41.220
The dude that's been laying down beats for us for a thousand years.

03:41.220 --> 03:44.220
Give it up for Zach McKee for everybody.

03:44.220 --> 03:46.220
Oh, lord.

03:46.220 --> 03:48.220
Oh, shit.

03:48.220 --> 03:50.220
I didn't really...

03:50.220 --> 03:52.220
Oh, yeah.

03:52.220 --> 03:54.220
Oh, yeah.

03:54.220 --> 03:56.220
Now the pants.

03:56.220 --> 03:58.220
Now the pants.

03:58.220 --> 04:00.220
Now the pants.

04:00.220 --> 04:02.220
Now the pants.

04:02.220 --> 04:04.220
I can't hear the beat.

04:04.220 --> 04:06.220
Yeah, turn it up.

04:06.220 --> 04:08.220
Some people fuck mamas.

04:08.220 --> 04:10.220
Not me.

04:10.220 --> 04:12.220
That's not what I do.

04:12.220 --> 04:14.220
My flow is clean.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.220
That's not what I do.

04:16.220 --> 04:18.220
My flow is clean.

04:18.220 --> 04:20.220
Elmer's blue.

04:20.220 --> 04:22.220
It's white and tidy.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.220
Your mama's nighty.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.220
Has blue on it, too.

04:28.220 --> 04:30.220
Talking about my cum.

04:32.220 --> 04:36.220
Cause when I'm done, fucking her.

04:36.220 --> 04:38.220
I...

04:38.220 --> 04:40.220
Eject you.

04:40.220 --> 04:42.220
Late.

04:42.220 --> 04:44.220
Eject you.

04:44.220 --> 04:47.220
Yo, I'm here to demonstrate.

04:47.220 --> 04:51.220
When I knock on an elite jacket, you late.

04:51.220 --> 04:54.220
Yo, I'm gonna put it on her plate.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.220
Okay, gross.

04:56.220 --> 04:58.220
Oh, no.

04:58.220 --> 05:00.220
I don't want a picture to come on place.

05:00.220 --> 05:02.220
You see one of those pornos, those gonzo pornos,

05:02.220 --> 05:04.220
where it's like, let's all come in a funnel

05:04.220 --> 05:06.220
or a cup or something, and it's like,

05:06.220 --> 05:08.220
or a cracker.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.220
I don't want exposed cum.

05:10.220 --> 05:12.220
On flesh.

05:12.220 --> 05:14.220
Cum on flesh, terrific.

05:14.220 --> 05:16.220
As soon as cum hits a floor

05:16.220 --> 05:18.220
or a couch or a plate

05:18.220 --> 05:20.220
or a saucer.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.220
It seems like a part two is coming

05:22.220 --> 05:24.220
once they start adding props to it.

05:24.220 --> 05:26.220
Hit that beat! Hit that beat!

05:26.220 --> 05:28.220
It didn't happen.

05:28.220 --> 05:30.220
Oh, no.

05:30.220 --> 05:32.220
Good instincts, thank you.

05:32.220 --> 05:34.220
You think after seven years we'd be able to drop a beat

05:34.220 --> 05:36.220
and you could talk about cumming on plates.

05:36.220 --> 05:38.220
Yeah, but it doesn't...

05:38.220 --> 05:40.220
We wouldn't be rewarded for that.

05:40.220 --> 05:42.220
After seven years, it took him to recognize

05:42.220 --> 05:44.220
when to not indulge you.

05:44.220 --> 05:46.220
Uh...

05:46.220 --> 05:48.220
We don't...

05:48.220 --> 05:50.220
We don't want any more of that right now.

05:50.220 --> 05:52.220
Um, so it's the

05:52.220 --> 05:54.220
360th episode of Harmontown.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.220
Uh...

05:56.220 --> 05:58.220
Full circle.

05:58.220 --> 06:00.220
We've got a... Full circle!

06:00.220 --> 06:02.220
Full circle. I mean, think about

06:02.220 --> 06:04.220
the unintentional odds

06:04.220 --> 06:06.220
that we would end on a 360.

06:06.220 --> 06:08.220
A full...

06:08.220 --> 06:10.220
Full circle!

06:10.220 --> 06:12.220
Full circle.

06:12.220 --> 06:14.220
What are the odds, Rob? What are the odds?

06:14.220 --> 06:16.220
360 odds.

06:16.220 --> 06:18.220
Whoa.

06:18.220 --> 06:20.220
Uh...

06:20.220 --> 06:22.220
We got overflow with, like, luminaries up here

06:22.220 --> 06:24.220
on stage.

06:24.220 --> 06:26.220
Friends of the show and things.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.220
This is our jury.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.220
And that still wasn't enough, Jeff.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.220
We still oversold or...

06:32.220 --> 06:34.220
I don't know. Well, hopefully there aren't...

06:34.220 --> 06:36.220
Anyways, we still had more people coming than we could ever see.

06:36.220 --> 06:38.220
So, apparently they're

06:38.220 --> 06:40.220
simulcasting to the

06:40.220 --> 06:42.220
Mexican place next door.

06:42.220 --> 06:44.220
Shout out to the Mexican place.

06:44.220 --> 06:46.220
La Fonda? I guess if you...

06:46.220 --> 06:48.220
They're eating the delicious tacos

06:48.220 --> 06:50.220
that is a dying podcast.

06:50.220 --> 06:52.220
Yeah.

06:52.220 --> 06:54.220
Uh, so hello to the people over there.

06:54.220 --> 06:56.220
Also, Dave Kline over here.

06:56.220 --> 06:58.220
Can I get a youp?

06:58.220 --> 07:00.220
Get a youp.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.220
One youp.

07:02.220 --> 07:04.220
Really committing to the Chewbacca thing here

07:04.220 --> 07:06.220
totally.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.220
Dan, be honest.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.220
Be brutally honest.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.220
Happy? Sad? How do you feel right now?

07:12.220 --> 07:14.220
Well, I don't know. First of all,

07:14.220 --> 07:16.220
I'm exhausted coming back from a family trip

07:16.220 --> 07:18.220
to the desert. I still got sand

07:18.220 --> 07:20.220
in every crevice.

07:22.220 --> 07:24.220
But I don't know.

07:24.220 --> 07:26.220
I think it's a very...

07:26.220 --> 07:28.220
I think before I would be able to feel anything,

07:28.220 --> 07:30.220
there would be defense mechanisms

07:30.220 --> 07:32.220
that would go up that would keep me from feeling.

07:32.220 --> 07:34.220
Which is something I can't really control.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.220
I'm a very...

07:36.220 --> 07:38.220
broken person.

07:38.220 --> 07:40.220
But you were the one

07:40.220 --> 07:42.220
that decided to kill this.

07:42.220 --> 07:44.220
And also, I can't believe

07:44.220 --> 07:46.220
this lasted more than seven weeks,

07:46.220 --> 07:48.220
not alone seven years.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.220
But you pulled

07:50.220 --> 07:52.220
the trigger on this...

07:52.220 --> 07:54.220
Yeah.

07:54.220 --> 07:56.220
To quote...

07:56.220 --> 07:58.220
Mike Eagle, I thought, had a great way

07:58.220 --> 08:00.220
of describing it in the green room,

08:00.220 --> 08:02.220
an emotionally pregnant night.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.220
I like that, because it's not...

08:04.220 --> 08:06.220
It's like, happy, sad, I don't know.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.220
It's like a pregnancy.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.220
Game changer.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.220
And then Emily,

08:12.220 --> 08:14.220
who started this thing, Emily Gordon,

08:14.220 --> 08:16.220
she is sad that she couldn't be here tonight,

08:16.220 --> 08:18.220
but she told everybody

08:18.220 --> 08:20.220
she wish she were here.

08:20.220 --> 08:22.220
She gave birth to this.

08:22.220 --> 08:24.220
She was the reason why we started this.

08:24.220 --> 08:26.220
She said she wanted to be here when it died.

08:26.220 --> 08:28.220
Which you can take in two different ways.

08:28.220 --> 08:30.220
She's at Stonehenge right now,

08:30.220 --> 08:32.220
so she's in a place of sacrifice.

08:36.220 --> 08:38.220
But for real, there was no reason

08:38.220 --> 08:40.220
the show should have lasted more than a year.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.220
It was crazy.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.220
We started monthly, right?

08:44.220 --> 08:46.220
And then it became weekly.

08:46.220 --> 08:48.220
And then for some stupid reason,

08:48.220 --> 08:50.220
it was two hours every fucking time.

08:52.220 --> 08:54.220
I'm only happy that it won't be

08:54.220 --> 08:56.220
two hours of my life every week.

08:56.220 --> 08:58.220
But I've met a bunch of people

08:58.220 --> 09:00.220
that travel from all over the planet.

09:00.220 --> 09:02.220
There's people from Spain here,

09:02.220 --> 09:04.220
there's people from Italy,

09:04.220 --> 09:06.220
there's people from...

09:06.220 --> 09:08.220
Sherman Oaks, yeah.

09:10.220 --> 09:12.220
I wish I didn't hear that.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.220
There's no guest, so I'm just going to come back.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.220
We have all these format rules,

09:16.220 --> 09:18.220
and one of them is that I stand out there

09:18.220 --> 09:20.220
and talk, but then the guest

09:20.220 --> 09:22.220
comes out and then I take my seat,

09:22.220 --> 09:24.220
so I'm just going to sit down now.

09:24.220 --> 09:26.220
It's a natural pillar to the show.

09:26.220 --> 09:28.220
Yeah, it's structure.

09:28.220 --> 09:30.220
But thinking about the time that we met Spencer

09:30.220 --> 09:32.220
for the first time, how many episodes

09:32.220 --> 09:34.220
were we in when Spencer...

09:34.220 --> 09:36.220
I was like episode five or something.

09:36.220 --> 09:38.220
Five?

09:38.220 --> 09:40.220
So that was before it was...

09:40.220 --> 09:42.220
a video, that was back when it was just...

09:42.220 --> 09:44.220
No video back then.

09:44.220 --> 09:46.220
You know the cops can...

09:46.220 --> 09:48.220
in America...

09:48.220 --> 09:50.220
They can shoot you.

09:50.220 --> 09:52.220
With guns.

09:52.220 --> 09:54.220
They can lie to you about

09:54.220 --> 09:56.220
what they have on you.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.220
They can tell you we found a bloody fingerprint

09:58.220 --> 10:00.220
and it's your fingerprint,

10:00.220 --> 10:02.220
and they don't have to be telling the truth about that.

10:02.220 --> 10:04.220
I don't know, good or bad.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.220
But here's the thing,

10:06.220 --> 10:08.220
I just heard this thing on this true crime podcast.

10:08.220 --> 10:10.220
I thought this was amazing.

10:10.220 --> 10:12.220
This girl goes to a party,

10:12.220 --> 10:14.220
she disappears,

10:14.220 --> 10:16.220
they find her body later,

10:16.220 --> 10:18.220
they find her body later,

10:18.220 --> 10:20.220
they find her body later,

10:20.220 --> 10:22.220
she disappears, they find her body later,

10:22.220 --> 10:24.220
she's been horribly...

10:24.220 --> 10:26.220
I don't want to dwell on the details of the crime

10:26.220 --> 10:28.220
because I want to skip to the funny part.

10:28.220 --> 10:30.220
But a life was lost

10:30.220 --> 10:32.220
and you know,

10:32.220 --> 10:34.220
that's why we listen to true crime,

10:34.220 --> 10:36.220
because it's for the victims.

10:40.220 --> 10:42.220
But the cops

10:42.220 --> 10:44.220
and trying to get the guy

10:44.220 --> 10:46.220
that they knew did it,

10:46.220 --> 10:48.220
but it's like, oh, your DNA is on her.

10:48.220 --> 10:50.220
It's on the places

10:50.220 --> 10:52.220
of her costume

10:52.220 --> 10:54.220
that are ripped and all this stuff.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.220
The guy is like, he's dead to rights,

10:56.220 --> 10:58.220
but he's just doing that thing.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.220
He tells one lie

11:00.220 --> 11:02.220
and then he gets caught in that lie

11:02.220 --> 11:04.220
and he's like, well, I did have sex at that party.

11:04.220 --> 11:06.220
It might have been her,

11:06.220 --> 11:08.220
consensual sex and all this stuff.

11:08.220 --> 11:10.220
The cop goes like, listen, man,

11:10.220 --> 11:12.220
look, we know you did it,

11:12.220 --> 11:14.220
but look, I don't think you're a killer.

11:14.220 --> 11:16.220
I think you did it on accident,

11:16.220 --> 11:18.220
but the guy's like, dude, I never even

11:18.220 --> 11:20.220
I don't even know what you're talking about.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.220
Then the cop kind of blurts out,

11:22.220 --> 11:24.220
he goes like, you know something

11:24.220 --> 11:26.220
you don't know about this girl?

11:26.220 --> 11:28.220
I'm going to tell you something you don't know.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.220
Dude, I don't know anything about her.

11:30.220 --> 11:32.220
Dude, she had brittle bone disease.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.220
Fuck.

11:34.220 --> 11:36.220
The cop just like busts out this amazing

11:36.220 --> 11:38.220
technique because then the guy's like

11:38.220 --> 11:40.220
going, oh.

11:40.220 --> 11:42.220
He's like, yeah, you could, I mean,

11:42.220 --> 11:44.220
if something happened, it's not your fault.

11:44.220 --> 11:46.220
That was his lie?

11:46.220 --> 11:48.220
Her bones, yeah, her bones are like made of glass.

11:48.220 --> 11:50.220
I just think it's amazing

11:50.220 --> 11:52.220
like a weird form of victim framing.

11:52.220 --> 11:54.220
He was trying to give this guy an out,

11:54.220 --> 11:56.220
like, look at that.

11:56.220 --> 11:58.220
Bro, you didn't know you were fucking a

11:58.220 --> 12:00.220
fabricated egg?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.220
And the guy totally fell for it.

12:02.220 --> 12:04.220
He's like, okay, look, man, you know,

12:04.220 --> 12:06.220
we were doing a little like choke play

12:06.220 --> 12:08.220
and like she choked me and there's no marks

12:08.220 --> 12:10.220
because my bones aren't brittle.

12:10.220 --> 12:12.220
And then I felt like brittle bones

12:12.220 --> 12:14.220
because she doesn't have brittle bones.

12:14.220 --> 12:16.220
Go to prison.

12:16.220 --> 12:18.220
Of course they made it up.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.220
I thought I had made that clear.

12:20.220 --> 12:22.220
They can make stuff up.

12:22.220 --> 12:24.220
I never heard that kind of thing made up.

12:24.220 --> 12:26.220
Not one of murder people.

12:26.220 --> 12:28.220
I feel like if they can lie, they should

12:28.220 --> 12:30.220
catch way more people than they do.

12:30.220 --> 12:32.220
They could just say fucking anything.

12:32.220 --> 12:34.220
You know, 60% of

12:34.220 --> 12:36.220
homicide goes

12:36.220 --> 12:38.220
unsolved.

12:38.220 --> 12:40.220
They're not telling the right lies.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.220
Or is it 40%? Maybe I just told one

12:42.220 --> 12:44.220
of an important lie.

12:44.220 --> 12:46.220
It's one or the other, but it's almost half.

12:46.220 --> 12:48.220
If you want to kill somebody,

12:48.220 --> 12:50.220
flip a coin, you might get away with it.

12:50.220 --> 12:52.220
They could say, hey, we finger pitted you.

12:52.220 --> 12:54.220
It doesn't look like you were at the crime scene,

12:54.220 --> 12:56.220
but we know that you have AIDS now.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.220
Because the person that you...

12:58.220 --> 13:00.220
Anything you want to get off the chest.

13:02.220 --> 13:04.220
Cheese out.

13:04.220 --> 13:06.220
And also it's 1981,

13:06.220 --> 13:08.220
and there's no...

13:08.220 --> 13:10.220
There's still a lot of misunderstandings

13:10.220 --> 13:12.220
about the illness and

13:12.220 --> 13:14.220
technology. What? It's not 1981.

13:14.220 --> 13:16.220
Dude, look

13:16.220 --> 13:18.220
at my partner, and he's got a little alligator

13:18.220 --> 13:20.220
that he made out of fabric

13:20.220 --> 13:22.220
really fast.

13:22.220 --> 13:24.220
That's not a real eyes-on shirt.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.220
Yeah, it is.

13:26.220 --> 13:28.220
He's got a fake Rubik's cube.

13:28.220 --> 13:30.220
He's got Debbie Gibson's hat on.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.220
So cops can

13:34.220 --> 13:36.220
just lie.

13:36.220 --> 13:38.220
Try.

13:38.220 --> 13:40.220
So my house has been spider gassed

13:40.220 --> 13:42.220
while I was out.

13:42.220 --> 13:44.220
I bought this house,

13:44.220 --> 13:46.220
and it's filled with spiders.

13:46.220 --> 13:48.220
Spider gas sounds terrifying.

13:48.220 --> 13:50.220
Apparently,

13:50.220 --> 13:52.220
there's different gas, because it was like,

13:52.220 --> 13:54.220
if I have cockroaches and spiders,

13:54.220 --> 13:56.220
and I call the spider gas guy,

13:56.220 --> 13:58.220
do the cockroaches just smell this gas

13:58.220 --> 14:00.220
and go like, yeah, fuck those guys.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.220
Good, more dried milk puddles for us.

14:02.220 --> 14:04.220
Yeah.

14:04.220 --> 14:06.220
What kind of spiders? You were looking around

14:06.220 --> 14:08.220
and there were spiders hanging about?

14:08.220 --> 14:10.220
The house is just filled with spiders.

14:10.220 --> 14:12.220
All kinds.

14:12.220 --> 14:14.220
So I don't think it was a real actual infestation,

14:14.220 --> 14:16.220
but I must have...

14:16.220 --> 14:18.220
I have a really good assistant,

14:18.220 --> 14:20.220
and I think I just...

14:20.220 --> 14:22.220
I was like, this place is filled with spiders,

14:22.220 --> 14:24.220
and then it got spider gassed

14:24.220 --> 14:26.220
while I was in the desert

14:26.220 --> 14:28.220
for Thanksgiving. But then the guy said

14:28.220 --> 14:30.220
something after he...

14:30.220 --> 14:32.220
Don't correct me if I'm wrong.

14:32.220 --> 14:34.220
It's not spider gas your place

14:34.220 --> 14:36.220
if they were up front about this part.

14:36.220 --> 14:38.220
The guy said,

14:38.220 --> 14:40.220
by the way, it doesn't just magically

14:40.220 --> 14:42.220
make the spiders all

14:42.220 --> 14:44.220
instantly die.

14:44.220 --> 14:46.220
You will see a few spiders over the next couple of days,

14:46.220 --> 14:48.220
maybe even more than usual,

14:48.220 --> 14:50.220
because they'll be fleeing for their lives.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.220
I'm not...

14:52.220 --> 14:54.220
I'm not...

14:54.220 --> 14:56.220
That's the only thing worse than a house full of spiders

14:56.220 --> 14:58.220
is a house full of spiders

14:58.220 --> 15:00.220
you tried and failed to kill.

15:00.220 --> 15:02.220
Yeah.

15:02.220 --> 15:04.220
The Josie Whales spiders?

15:04.220 --> 15:06.220
Fucking pale rider spiders.

15:06.220 --> 15:08.220
They're like pulling at your leg,

15:08.220 --> 15:10.220
desperately pleading for help.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.220
Oh, that's very empathic of you.

15:12.220 --> 15:14.220
I'm imagining I'm like fucking Brandon Lee

15:14.220 --> 15:16.220
in the crow, like a pair of lightning flashes

15:16.220 --> 15:18.220
in their silhouette, and they're like,

15:18.220 --> 15:20.220
nice try.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.220
Like, you want to try that again?

15:22.220 --> 15:24.220
Like,

15:24.220 --> 15:26.220
you just wake up covered in webs,

15:26.220 --> 15:28.220
and they're like...

15:28.220 --> 15:30.220
coughing up blood into their little spider hankies,

15:30.220 --> 15:32.220
but it's like, they still got enough fight in them

15:32.220 --> 15:34.220
to do shit that

15:34.220 --> 15:36.220
spiders normally don't do because

15:36.220 --> 15:38.220
they fear repercussion.

15:38.220 --> 15:40.220
They're long-term

15:40.220 --> 15:42.220
thinker spiders, the inventors of the web.

15:50.220 --> 15:52.220
Owls are wise, elephants

15:52.220 --> 15:54.220
never forget, spiders, incredibly

15:54.220 --> 15:56.220
patient.

15:56.220 --> 15:58.220
Long-term thinkers,

15:58.220 --> 16:00.220
you don't want to piss them off.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.220
That's kind of cool.

16:02.220 --> 16:04.220
As a human, if you were hungry,

16:04.220 --> 16:06.220
you could just make a plate and wait.

16:06.220 --> 16:08.220
Yeah.

16:08.220 --> 16:10.220
Yeah. That's what they do.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.220
But then they also,

16:12.220 --> 16:14.220
every spider web you walk through,

16:14.220 --> 16:16.220
there's only a one in ten chance

16:16.220 --> 16:18.220
that you're actually walking through

16:18.220 --> 16:20.220
an inhabited spider web because

16:20.220 --> 16:22.220
they spin one and they wait,

16:22.220 --> 16:24.220
and then they have to decide

16:24.220 --> 16:26.220
when to blame the web,

16:26.220 --> 16:28.220
when to blame the location.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.220
They just go and do another one.

16:30.220 --> 16:32.220
And so that's why, you know, cobwebs

16:32.220 --> 16:34.220
and stuff, because the spiders are always working.

16:36.220 --> 16:38.220
They're like little prospectors,

16:38.220 --> 16:40.220
those guys, good for them.

16:40.220 --> 16:42.220
Well, look, hey,

16:42.220 --> 16:44.220
yeah, I decided to end the show.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.220
Now, do you understand why?

16:46.220 --> 16:48.220
We are only

16:48.220 --> 16:50.220
on episode 360, we're down to talking about

16:50.220 --> 16:54.220
the patience of spiders.

16:54.220 --> 16:56.220
And the leverage cops can wield

16:56.220 --> 16:58.220
by lying about brittle bone disease,

16:58.220 --> 17:00.220
which I think is a 30 rock bit, Cody said.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.220
She's like, I think that cop heard that

17:02.220 --> 17:04.220
on 30 rock, brittle bone disease.

17:04.220 --> 17:06.220
Is that even real?

17:06.220 --> 17:08.220
And if it is, and you're offended,

17:08.220 --> 17:10.220
don't jump up and storm the stage

17:10.220 --> 17:12.220
and blame us.

17:12.220 --> 17:14.220
Because you'll break your motherfucking neck.

17:16.220 --> 17:18.220
Yeah.

17:18.220 --> 17:20.220
Your put down just became a PSA.

17:23.220 --> 17:25.220
We were, uh...

17:29.220 --> 17:31.220
So high right now.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.220
Yeah.

17:39.220 --> 17:42.220
We should name a strain after the end of this show.

17:42.220 --> 17:44.220
Yeah.

17:44.220 --> 17:46.220
Oh, my God, look at my suit.

17:46.220 --> 17:48.220
Your suit is good.

17:48.220 --> 17:50.220
It's a damn good suit.

17:50.220 --> 17:52.220
I thought it was white.

17:52.220 --> 17:54.220
But you're fucking...

17:54.220 --> 17:56.220
You really are that high.

17:56.220 --> 17:58.220
It feels like a Dean Martin roast.

17:58.220 --> 18:00.220
We are talking to

18:00.220 --> 18:02.220
Brandon Johnson.

18:02.220 --> 18:04.220
He's the only man that's so high.

18:04.220 --> 18:06.220
He's the only man I've ever seen

18:06.220 --> 18:08.220
walking around with a snake in his hand

18:08.220 --> 18:10.220
trying to beat up a stick.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.220
What?

18:12.220 --> 18:14.220
The stick had it coming.

18:14.220 --> 18:16.220
Uh...

18:16.220 --> 18:18.220
So, uh...

18:18.220 --> 18:20.220
I'll give you two choices.

18:20.220 --> 18:22.220
We can start to share

18:22.220 --> 18:24.220
some favorite

18:24.220 --> 18:26.220
memories of the show,

18:26.220 --> 18:28.220
or I can get your advice

18:28.220 --> 18:30.220
on whether I should get an 8K TV.

18:34.220 --> 18:36.220
Because I feel like 4K

18:36.220 --> 18:38.220
is enough.

18:38.220 --> 18:40.220
Isn't the human eye just

18:40.220 --> 18:42.220
1080p?

18:42.220 --> 18:44.220
I feel like the higher the definition,

18:44.220 --> 18:46.220
the more...

18:46.220 --> 18:48.220
Excited to the sweater.

18:52.220 --> 18:54.220
A non-high five is happening.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.220
Jerking off a microphone.

19:00.220 --> 19:02.220
You want to help out?

19:02.220 --> 19:04.220
Wait.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.220
I would say number one,

19:06.220 --> 19:08.220
but let's go number two.

19:08.220 --> 19:10.220
Let's go 8K.

19:10.220 --> 19:12.220
Do you think I should get an 8K TV?

19:14.220 --> 19:16.220
Because I feel like this guy's giving a thumbs up back here.

19:16.220 --> 19:18.220
I really don't know what that means.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.220
You're the man who stood on stage

19:20.220 --> 19:22.220
and proudly proclaimed you wanted

19:22.220 --> 19:24.220
the most expensive peanut butter.

19:24.220 --> 19:26.220
Yeah.

19:26.220 --> 19:28.220
But not...

19:28.220 --> 19:30.220
Not...

19:30.220 --> 19:32.220
Not phony peanut butter.

19:32.220 --> 19:34.220
That's like...

19:34.220 --> 19:36.220
This peanut butter makes you fly.

19:36.220 --> 19:38.220
And then...

19:38.220 --> 19:40.220
When you get up to 8K resolution,

19:40.220 --> 19:42.220
you're kind of buying a lie at a certain point.

19:42.220 --> 19:44.220
Isn't the human eye incapable of seeing

19:44.220 --> 19:46.220
beyond a certain resolution?

19:46.220 --> 19:48.220
Not at our age.

19:52.220 --> 19:54.220
I feel like watching old movies

19:54.220 --> 19:56.220
on really high resolution

19:56.220 --> 19:58.220
makes it look like a reality show.

19:58.220 --> 20:00.220
You don't do that.

20:00.220 --> 20:02.220
No, don't do that.

20:02.220 --> 20:04.220
Stop it.

20:04.220 --> 20:06.220
I want Dan to go to the second question.

20:06.220 --> 20:08.220
I told the guy, let's stick with 4K,

20:08.220 --> 20:10.220
just so you know.

20:10.220 --> 20:12.220
I asked you for your advice for nothing,

20:12.220 --> 20:14.220
but I just wanted to...

20:14.220 --> 20:16.220
Yeah, thank you, sir.

20:16.220 --> 20:18.220
Dan, emotionally.

20:18.220 --> 20:20.220
Emotionally.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.220
Because you've used Harmontown

20:22.220 --> 20:24.220
as your vehicle

20:24.220 --> 20:26.220
to kind of go through

20:26.220 --> 20:28.220
catharsis and through therapy

20:28.220 --> 20:30.220
when this stops.

20:30.220 --> 20:32.220
Are you going to miss what you get out of this?

20:32.220 --> 20:34.220
Or are you going to be happy

20:34.220 --> 20:36.220
to throw this in the garbage?

20:36.220 --> 20:38.220
Yeah, but I'll miss it.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.220
But, you know,

20:40.220 --> 20:42.220
there's a difference between missing something

20:42.220 --> 20:44.220
and regretting.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.220
You know, I think you got a...

20:46.220 --> 20:48.220
I don't know.

20:48.220 --> 20:50.220
Don't you think Keras and Keeler wishes

20:50.220 --> 20:52.220
maybe he would, you know,

20:52.220 --> 20:54.220
a little...

20:54.220 --> 20:56.220
What?

20:56.220 --> 20:58.220
He just took a shit on his thing.

20:58.220 --> 21:00.220
I think he did.

21:00.220 --> 21:02.220
I just think, you know,

21:02.220 --> 21:04.220
he could do a show for...

21:04.220 --> 21:06.220
I'm not like Robert Altman.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.220
I don't want to die doing stuff.

21:08.220 --> 21:10.220
What was the reason that you said,

21:10.220 --> 21:12.220
okay, let's stop?

21:14.220 --> 21:16.220
I think it was...

21:16.220 --> 21:18.220
You brought that country western singer up here,

21:18.220 --> 21:20.220
and...

21:20.220 --> 21:22.220
Okay, that happened?

21:22.220 --> 21:24.220
I had Mitch Hurwitz as a guest,

21:24.220 --> 21:26.220
and then you guys went off stage

21:26.220 --> 21:28.220
and sang a song in the green room.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.220
Steve Levy, ladies and gentlemen.

21:30.220 --> 21:32.220
Wait,

21:32.220 --> 21:34.220
you're going to blame the end of Harmontown

21:34.220 --> 21:36.220
on me bringing Robbie Fox on stage?

21:36.220 --> 21:38.220
Yeah, we were going to keep doing the show until that night.

21:38.220 --> 21:40.220
I think you announced it before that.

21:40.220 --> 21:42.220
What do you mean, Dan?

21:42.220 --> 21:44.220
This sounds like it went really bad.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.220
It went bad, yeah.

21:48.220 --> 21:50.220
We stopped doing the show.

21:50.220 --> 21:52.220
Why do you bring up Robbie Fox coming on stage?

21:54.220 --> 21:56.220
I just answered your question.

21:56.220 --> 21:58.220
That was the night, though. You killed the show.

21:58.220 --> 22:00.220
He said, it's your fault, Jeff.

22:00.220 --> 22:02.220
Jeff. Jeff. Jeff.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.220
Jeff.

22:04.220 --> 22:06.220
He says, it's your fault.

22:06.220 --> 22:08.220
Fuck.

22:08.220 --> 22:10.220
Why is that? Why do you need to know that?

22:10.220 --> 22:12.220
Why was it Robbie Fox's fault?

22:12.220 --> 22:14.220
Why can't it be?

22:16.220 --> 22:18.220
Answer the question.

22:18.220 --> 22:20.220
Answer my question.

22:20.220 --> 22:22.220
What's your question?

22:22.220 --> 22:24.220
Why can't it be his fault?

22:24.220 --> 22:26.220
Because he was just a guest?

22:26.220 --> 22:28.220
Right.

22:30.220 --> 22:32.220
Well, I didn't book him.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.220
You didn't book Open Mike Eagle.

22:36.220 --> 22:38.220
He's here tonight. You didn't book him.

22:38.220 --> 22:40.220
We ran into each other and he came out.

22:40.220 --> 22:42.220
I told you,

22:42.220 --> 22:44.220
there is an Open Mike Eagle ban

22:44.220 --> 22:46.220
in effect on the show.

22:46.220 --> 22:48.220
You defied it.

22:48.220 --> 22:50.220
Oh, shit. Yeah.

22:50.220 --> 22:52.220
This is how I find out.

22:52.220 --> 22:56.220
We have a closed Open Mike Eagle policy.

22:56.220 --> 22:58.220
Yeah, it's a closed Mike Eagle.

22:58.220 --> 23:00.220
The Robbie Fox episode was

23:00.220 --> 23:02.220
long after the decision was made

23:02.220 --> 23:04.220
to stop the show.

23:04.220 --> 23:06.220
Why do you bring that up?

23:06.220 --> 23:08.220
Because that was the reason.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.220
I just wanted to keep having the show be fun

23:10.220 --> 23:12.220
and not do it like a deposition

23:12.220 --> 23:14.220
about why I chose to kill it.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.220
I mean, I think there's a lot of answers

23:16.220 --> 23:18.220
to that question.

23:18.220 --> 23:20.220
But I don't think...

23:20.220 --> 23:22.220
Answer number one.

23:22.220 --> 23:24.220
Coming up.

23:24.220 --> 23:26.220
I think that...

23:26.220 --> 23:28.220
Right after...

23:28.220 --> 23:30.220
this song...

23:30.220 --> 23:32.220
by a guest singer that's coming up.

23:32.220 --> 23:34.220
One answer to the question is

23:34.220 --> 23:36.220
from a...

23:36.220 --> 23:38.220
what would you call it, a stylistic

23:38.220 --> 23:40.220
perspective?

23:40.220 --> 23:42.220
I don't think that's quite the word either.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.220
I know that one answer,

23:44.220 --> 23:46.220
but it's probably maybe like 10%

23:46.220 --> 23:48.220
of all the reasons.

23:48.220 --> 23:50.220
The whole kind of like...

23:50.220 --> 23:52.220
moving from a world

23:52.220 --> 23:54.220
as we have during the 8-year run of the show

23:54.220 --> 23:56.220
from where the internet was

23:56.220 --> 23:58.220
a place you hid from the real world

23:58.220 --> 24:00.220
to the internet for better or for worse,

24:00.220 --> 24:02.220
now the real world.

24:02.220 --> 24:04.220
And a whole

24:04.220 --> 24:06.220
generation went from being

24:06.220 --> 24:08.220
12 years old to whatever

24:08.220 --> 24:10.220
12 plus 8 is.

24:10.220 --> 24:12.220
I didn't come to L.A.

24:12.220 --> 24:14.220
to do math.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.220
But...

24:16.220 --> 24:18.220
Thank you.

24:18.220 --> 24:20.220
Thank you.

24:24.220 --> 24:26.220
But the whole...

24:26.220 --> 24:28.220
They were born online.

24:28.220 --> 24:30.220
And the world is online.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.220
And as such,

24:32.220 --> 24:34.220
because of all of the social changes and things,

24:34.220 --> 24:36.220
it's sort of like this idea

24:36.220 --> 24:38.220
of me playing myself

24:38.220 --> 24:40.220
as a character.

24:40.220 --> 24:42.220
I think I'm at a crossroads

24:42.220 --> 24:44.220
at 46, having done this for almost a decade.

24:44.220 --> 24:46.220
And really, I've been doing that

24:46.220 --> 24:48.220
for 25 years.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.220
Going like, hey, look at me. I'm Dan Harmon.

24:50.220 --> 24:52.220
You know what happened to me today?

24:52.220 --> 24:54.220
I'm going to tell you the whole thing.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.220
And like, I'm the fucking...

24:56.220 --> 24:58.220
It's me. The name of my birth certificate

24:58.220 --> 25:00.220
is the name of this clown.

25:00.220 --> 25:02.220
So if you have a complaint, just type

25:02.220 --> 25:04.220
my name into the internet and tweet me.

25:04.220 --> 25:06.220
And if I do something wrong,

25:06.220 --> 25:08.220
get me fucking destroyed.

25:08.220 --> 25:10.220
Like, destroy my life.

25:10.220 --> 25:12.220
Because my life is...

25:12.220 --> 25:14.220
For 20 years, I was like, yeah, that's cool

25:14.220 --> 25:16.220
and easy too, because I'm lazy.

25:16.220 --> 25:18.220
And I think we've hit

25:18.220 --> 25:20.220
a crossroads here. We're doing that

25:20.220 --> 25:22.220
as a really specific choice to make now.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.220
Like, moving forward from this,

25:24.220 --> 25:26.220
if I kept

25:26.220 --> 25:28.220
advertising myself

25:28.220 --> 25:30.220
as like,

25:30.220 --> 25:32.220
hey, this is my show.

25:32.220 --> 25:34.220
This is my name.

25:34.220 --> 25:36.220
This is the name of the person I was born.

25:36.220 --> 25:38.220
Here's all of the things about me

25:38.220 --> 25:40.220
and all these things. I become a brand.

25:40.220 --> 25:42.220
Like, moving forward from here,

25:42.220 --> 25:44.220
now that we've hit this tipping point of like,

25:44.220 --> 25:46.220
everyone's online and everything that is online

25:46.220 --> 25:48.220
is part of a constant conversation

25:48.220 --> 25:50.220
about where everyone stands and what you're going to do

25:50.220 --> 25:52.220
about it. And it's almost like,

25:52.220 --> 25:54.220
I don't... I like being

25:54.220 --> 25:56.220
who I am, but at the same time,

25:56.220 --> 25:58.220
I personally

25:58.220 --> 26:00.220
wouldn't continue

26:00.220 --> 26:02.220
to listen to a guy

26:02.220 --> 26:04.220
in a podcast go like,

26:04.220 --> 26:06.220
yeah, but what about me?

26:06.220 --> 26:08.220
Like, because it's just not...

26:08.220 --> 26:10.220
I don't... There wouldn't be my choice anymore.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.220
I wouldn't continue to find it therapeutic

26:12.220 --> 26:14.220
because

26:14.220 --> 26:16.220
I... And so, and then you start...

26:16.220 --> 26:18.220
It's just like, I would have to like,

26:18.220 --> 26:20.220
either willfully compartmentalize

26:20.220 --> 26:22.220
my pride

26:22.220 --> 26:24.220
from my

26:24.220 --> 26:26.220
narcissism and all this stuff. Like, put all these

26:26.220 --> 26:28.220
parts about me against themselves

26:28.220 --> 26:30.220
only for the end goal

26:30.220 --> 26:32.220
of having a podcast.

26:32.220 --> 26:34.220
Or I can like,

26:34.220 --> 26:36.220
let the podcast kind of drift away

26:36.220 --> 26:38.220
while I continue this process

26:38.220 --> 26:40.220
of letting, like, who I am

26:40.220 --> 26:42.220
kind of like,

26:42.220 --> 26:44.220
disentangle and

26:44.220 --> 26:46.220
sort itself out.

26:46.220 --> 26:48.220
Because I don't... And I mean this

26:48.220 --> 26:50.220
with the utmost respect. Like, I don't want to...

26:50.220 --> 26:52.220
The best case scenario

26:52.220 --> 26:54.220
is Joe Rogan, right?

26:54.220 --> 26:56.220
Like, you've got a billion people

26:56.220 --> 26:58.220
listening to you. You're...

26:58.220 --> 27:00.220
Everything that you say is like...

27:00.220 --> 27:02.220
It's like, I don't want to be a brand.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.220
I don't want to stand

27:04.220 --> 27:06.220
for things by being... Having been born.

27:06.220 --> 27:08.220
I don't want... I don't want to be...

27:08.220 --> 27:10.220
I just like, oh, you're...

27:10.220 --> 27:12.220
That's that Dan Harmon

27:12.220 --> 27:14.220
thing, that principle.

27:14.220 --> 27:16.220
Like, I want to like...

27:16.220 --> 27:18.220
I want to like, own a gun and be liberal.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.220
And you can't...

27:20.220 --> 27:22.220
I want to like, do all kinds

27:22.220 --> 27:24.220
of like, paradoxical things

27:24.220 --> 27:26.220
and it's like... And I don't want to have

27:26.220 --> 27:28.220
to think about when I'm doing them

27:28.220 --> 27:30.220
like, how I'm going to

27:30.220 --> 27:32.220
like, figure out how to sell them.

27:32.220 --> 27:34.220
And that's, again,

27:34.220 --> 27:36.220
that is one big bucket

27:36.220 --> 27:38.220
that's like, 10% of the reason.

27:38.220 --> 27:40.220
There's a bunch of...

27:40.220 --> 27:42.220
I just think

27:42.220 --> 27:44.220
who wants to start

27:44.220 --> 27:46.220
sucking, like...

27:46.220 --> 27:48.220
Not that the show's never been good, I just...

27:48.220 --> 27:50.220
But...

27:50.220 --> 27:52.220
Who wants to just keep, you know...

27:52.220 --> 27:54.220
I don't know.

27:54.220 --> 27:56.220
I can't believe the show ever lasted

27:56.220 --> 27:58.220
more than seven weeks.

27:58.220 --> 28:00.220
The fact that it went for more than

28:00.220 --> 28:02.220
10 years is crazy.

28:02.220 --> 28:04.220
But I've met so many people that have flown

28:04.220 --> 28:06.220
from like, those people here tonight

28:06.220 --> 28:08.220
that came from all over the planet.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.220
And

28:10.220 --> 28:12.220
there's a weird

28:12.220 --> 28:14.220
relationship that people have

28:14.220 --> 28:16.220
that there's people that have gone

28:16.220 --> 28:18.220
through depression or illness or

28:18.220 --> 28:20.220
injury and

28:20.220 --> 28:22.220
they have a connection

28:22.220 --> 28:24.220
to this show that

28:24.220 --> 28:26.220
I don't understand because

28:26.220 --> 28:28.220
we just get up here and just kind of fuck about.

28:28.220 --> 28:30.220
Like, for us, it's just

28:30.220 --> 28:32.220
silly.

28:32.220 --> 28:34.220
Or maybe for you, or for me, or for Spencer,

28:34.220 --> 28:36.220
or

28:36.220 --> 28:38.220
for Dave Kline's

28:38.220 --> 28:40.220
the people that we brought up on stage

28:40.220 --> 28:42.220
are

28:42.220 --> 28:44.220
Shromp, Brandon...

28:44.220 --> 28:46.220
We can fuck about too?

28:46.220 --> 28:48.220
Yeah.

28:48.220 --> 28:50.220
It's always been a weird way to be

28:50.220 --> 28:52.220
kind of cathartic and let out

28:52.220 --> 28:54.220
whatever's going on in our mind, but

28:54.220 --> 28:56.220
there's people that have

28:56.220 --> 28:58.220
like, for me,

28:58.220 --> 29:00.220
I don't really understand the connection that

29:00.220 --> 29:02.220
people have that people are really sad that

29:02.220 --> 29:04.220
it's ending because

29:04.220 --> 29:06.220
they went through

29:06.220 --> 29:08.220
psychological stuff

29:08.220 --> 29:10.220
and this show had an impact on it.

29:10.220 --> 29:12.220
I don't get it.

29:12.220 --> 29:14.220
I don't get it. I was listening

29:14.220 --> 29:16.220
to the show, the podcast,

29:16.220 --> 29:18.220
last week

29:18.220 --> 29:20.220
and I don't know if you

29:20.220 --> 29:22.220
listened to the show

29:22.220 --> 29:24.220
last week, Jeff,

29:24.220 --> 29:26.220
but the end of the show last week

29:26.220 --> 29:28.220
just devolved into all of us

29:28.220 --> 29:30.220
screaming over each other.

29:30.220 --> 29:32.220
No, you did this.

29:32.220 --> 29:34.220
And

29:34.220 --> 29:36.220
I'm like, who

29:36.220 --> 29:38.220
doesn't know us would ever

29:38.220 --> 29:40.220
want to listen to this?

29:40.220 --> 29:42.220
I want to turn it off. But we found out

29:42.220 --> 29:44.220
over the years that

29:44.220 --> 29:46.220
Stranger is... That's my voice!

29:48.220 --> 29:50.220
Oh, no.

29:50.220 --> 29:52.220
A giant man

29:52.220 --> 29:54.220
has walked on the stage

29:54.220 --> 29:56.220
and is texting on his phone

29:56.220 --> 29:58.220
in the background of the stage.

29:58.220 --> 30:00.220
Y'all got to warn me about shit like this.

30:02.220 --> 30:04.220
What? Do you see something?

30:04.220 --> 30:06.220
His shoes are giant.

30:06.220 --> 30:08.220
Where? Where?

30:08.220 --> 30:10.220
There's nothing back there.

30:10.220 --> 30:12.220
What?

30:12.220 --> 30:14.220
Nick is on Stilts back here.

30:14.220 --> 30:16.220
That is really terrifying.

30:16.220 --> 30:18.220
I think he's just a giant man.

30:18.220 --> 30:20.220
For everybody to really check out.

30:20.220 --> 30:22.220
Don't trip on the cable.

30:26.220 --> 30:28.220
I have to be honest.

30:28.220 --> 30:30.220
I don't like it. I do not like it.

30:30.220 --> 30:32.220
Yo, it's a great talent.

30:32.220 --> 30:34.220
But I don't want to be by it, really.

30:34.220 --> 30:36.220
I don't really want to be, like, by it.

30:36.220 --> 30:38.220
No, no, no.

30:38.220 --> 30:40.220
Hi.

30:40.220 --> 30:42.220
Big fan.

30:42.220 --> 30:44.220
He's a big fan.

30:44.220 --> 30:46.220
To all the people that travel far and wide,

30:46.220 --> 30:48.220
this is what you get.

30:48.220 --> 30:50.220
So this is...

30:50.220 --> 30:52.220
We got a nine-foot dude on stage.

30:52.220 --> 30:54.220
What is going on, Nick?

30:54.220 --> 30:56.220
What's happening?

30:56.220 --> 30:58.220
Can we get a spot on your face?

30:58.220 --> 31:00.220
He's too tall for the light.

31:00.220 --> 31:02.220
There you go.

31:02.220 --> 31:04.220
I think you should stage dive.

31:04.220 --> 31:06.220
See how far we can get.

31:06.220 --> 31:08.220
Hey, guys.

31:08.220 --> 31:10.220
Sorry, I was trying to get

31:10.220 --> 31:12.220
to the popcorn.

31:12.220 --> 31:14.220
It's still up in the front.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.220
Is that over there?

31:16.220 --> 31:18.220
I don't do well with stairs, so that's going to...

31:18.220 --> 31:20.220
Hey, could you two do, like,

31:20.220 --> 31:22.220
kind of like a 100-year-old man,

31:22.220 --> 31:24.220
a thousand-year-old man kind of, like,

31:24.220 --> 31:26.220
a team...

31:26.220 --> 31:28.220
Like a classic comedy.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.220
Like a classic comedy team, like,

31:30.220 --> 31:32.220
I'm here with the tallest men in the world.

31:32.220 --> 31:34.220
Okay, go for it.

31:34.220 --> 31:36.220
Yeah, of course you can do it.

31:36.220 --> 31:38.220
Yeah, whatever you want.

31:38.220 --> 31:40.220
The tallest man in the world.

31:40.220 --> 31:42.220
The tallest man in the world.

31:42.220 --> 31:44.220
Oh, yeah.

31:44.220 --> 31:46.220
For those of you at home,

31:46.220 --> 31:48.220
we are looking at a tall man

31:48.220 --> 31:50.220
next to Dan, who is of normal size.

31:50.220 --> 31:52.220
Normal size,

31:52.220 --> 31:54.220
and extremely tall man.

31:54.220 --> 31:56.220
He's giving the tallest, fiercest

31:56.220 --> 31:58.220
look of all.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.220
Yes, he's tall daddy,

32:00.220 --> 32:02.220
white shoes and khaki pants that say,

32:02.220 --> 32:04.220
I'll stand over you.

32:04.220 --> 32:06.220
I...

32:06.220 --> 32:11.220
Uh...

32:11.220 --> 32:13.220
He's working realness

32:13.220 --> 32:15.220
with a vision.

32:15.220 --> 32:17.220
Standing at over 9-1.

32:17.220 --> 32:20.220
He's a genius.

32:20.220 --> 32:22.220
Hey, if you can twerk and stilts,

32:22.220 --> 32:24.220
I'll definitely throw money at you.

32:24.220 --> 32:26.220
Oh, shit.

32:26.220 --> 32:27.220
Okay.

32:27.220 --> 32:29.220
Look at him shake that ass.

32:29.220 --> 32:31.220
Get your dollars out,

32:31.220 --> 32:34.220
and I'm talking about hard gold coins.

32:34.220 --> 32:37.220
Can I get more branding in the monitors, please?

32:37.220 --> 32:39.220
I do.

32:42.220 --> 32:45.220
Can we raise the monitors up four feet, please?

32:45.220 --> 32:47.220
Can't hear anything.

32:49.220 --> 32:51.220
I'm here with the world's tallest man,

32:51.220 --> 32:53.220
which is a one-for-one analog

32:53.220 --> 32:55.220
for world's oldest man.

32:55.220 --> 32:58.220
So, whereas the world's oldest man,

32:58.220 --> 33:00.220
we would talk about the things

33:00.220 --> 33:02.220
you've seen throughout history

33:02.220 --> 33:04.220
like historically contextual,

33:04.220 --> 33:06.220
like, kind of one-liners.

33:06.220 --> 33:09.220
Uh, I guess we're just going to stick to just, like, height.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.220
I hate...

33:11.220 --> 33:13.220
I hate trees.

33:13.220 --> 33:16.220
You must have gotten quite a few arguments

33:16.220 --> 33:19.220
with specific species of tree.

33:19.220 --> 33:21.220
Yeah, everyone with, uh...

33:21.220 --> 33:24.220
branches.

33:24.220 --> 33:26.220
I love light poles.

33:26.220 --> 33:28.220
Ooh.

33:28.220 --> 33:32.220
I say, is it hard for a fella like you to, uh...

33:34.220 --> 33:38.220
Using his elbows and waist, no one's seen.

33:38.220 --> 33:42.220
He's the tall daddy, a killing machine.

33:44.220 --> 33:46.220
This is good for an audio podcast, right?

33:46.220 --> 33:48.220
Right. Yeah.

33:49.220 --> 33:54.220
For $5, you can watch the last episode of Harmontown.

33:54.220 --> 33:56.220
I say, is it hard for a fella like you

33:56.220 --> 33:58.220
to, uh...

33:58.220 --> 34:00.220
enjoy the company of women?

34:02.220 --> 34:05.220
I am way into the crowns of heads.

34:09.220 --> 34:11.220
Ladies, don't hesitate.

34:11.220 --> 34:13.220
Faster bait.

34:13.220 --> 34:15.220
He's your tall daddy.

34:15.220 --> 34:18.220
Waste episode of laughing I've ever seen.

34:18.220 --> 34:22.220
There must be quite a few places you're not allowed

34:22.220 --> 34:24.220
being that tall.

34:24.220 --> 34:27.220
Yeah, let's say him together.

34:45.220 --> 34:48.220
What's it like down there?

34:48.220 --> 34:51.220
Look who's back.

34:51.220 --> 34:54.220
He's at least six inches of butt crap.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.220
That's pretty average, I feel.

34:59.220 --> 35:01.220
Definitely more than six.

35:01.220 --> 35:03.220
Yeah.

35:03.220 --> 35:05.220
Uh...

35:05.220 --> 35:07.220
You know, I'm normally a bad interviewer

35:07.220 --> 35:10.220
and also it's bad improv to ask questions, so...

35:10.220 --> 35:12.220
I don't know, uh...

35:14.220 --> 35:16.220
Shit!

35:16.220 --> 35:18.220
There's no man on trial, there's no denial!

35:18.220 --> 35:20.220
Oh, shit.

35:20.220 --> 35:22.220
All right, all right.

35:22.220 --> 35:25.220
I'm very happy to be here, Dan, Jeff, all the crew.

35:25.220 --> 35:27.220
Thank you guys so much, uh, Brandt.

35:27.220 --> 35:30.220
Let's give it up for Nick, the tallest man in town.

35:33.220 --> 35:36.220
Nick Rutherford, the tallest man.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.220
I hate the shoes the most.

35:43.220 --> 35:45.220
Do they freak you out a little bit?

35:45.220 --> 35:48.220
I'm surprised at his feet are that big.

35:48.220 --> 35:53.220
He got regular-sized hands and size 47 feet.

35:53.220 --> 35:55.220
Yeah.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.220
No thanks.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.220
No thanks.

35:59.220 --> 36:03.220
He looks like... like I'm looking at him with a fisheye lens.

36:03.220 --> 36:05.220
Yeah.

36:05.220 --> 36:07.220
Mike, what you been up to? What you been working on?

36:07.220 --> 36:09.220
Uh, music? Yeah.

36:09.220 --> 36:12.220
That's, yeah. It's a stock answer, but it's always true.

36:12.220 --> 36:16.220
Are you one of those ambitious tenacious sorts that, like, works all the time?

36:16.220 --> 36:19.220
Yeah, but not only because I have to pay for things all the time,

36:19.220 --> 36:21.220
and that's the only way I make money.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.220
You have to pay for things to get money.

36:23.220 --> 36:26.220
No, I have to make music to make money to pay for things.

36:26.220 --> 36:28.220
Okay.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.220
You know, I learned a new saying today,

36:30.220 --> 36:32.220
because we were talking about Naked Martin.

36:38.220 --> 36:41.220
I don't know, it doesn't sound the way I think you think it sounds.

36:41.220 --> 36:44.220
Like, it says it because it's like the middle of a song,

36:44.220 --> 36:48.220
so it's not like every time it's like a, you know, like the song's starting.

36:48.220 --> 36:50.220
I will never do it again.

36:50.220 --> 36:52.220
Oh, that's you? You're doing that?

36:52.220 --> 36:55.220
Yeah, for 300 episodes.

36:55.220 --> 36:58.220
I'm blaming somebody in the back with my eyes the whole time.

36:58.220 --> 37:00.220
These people are professionals.

37:00.220 --> 37:02.220
It's this, Motherfucker.

37:04.220 --> 37:07.220
Did you ever talk about Naked Martin on this show?

37:07.220 --> 37:09.220
No, no, I never have.

37:09.220 --> 37:12.220
And today, and Cody said, you know, if you do what you love,

37:12.220 --> 37:15.220
you never have to work a day in your life.

37:15.220 --> 37:20.220
For instance, Naked Martin, who came into our lives courtesy of

37:20.220 --> 37:24.220
Cody's old roommate, Nicole, who was on this trip with us.

37:24.220 --> 37:27.220
Nicole was doing comedy somewhere,

37:27.220 --> 37:31.220
and some British couple where at the bar,

37:31.220 --> 37:34.220
getting shit-faced, and they were like looking at some video on their phone,

37:34.220 --> 37:37.220
and they're like, do you want to see the funniest video ever?

37:37.220 --> 37:40.220
And it was like, there's this British guy,

37:40.220 --> 37:45.220
and he's like looking at the camera, and he says,

37:45.220 --> 37:49.220
hello, Alex and Peggy.

37:49.220 --> 37:52.220
He gives us this personalized message,

37:52.220 --> 37:56.220
and goes like, congratulations on your recent engagement.

37:56.220 --> 37:59.220
Have fun in Hamburg, and stay away from those oranges.

37:59.220 --> 38:01.220
And he gives a little naughty tis-finger.

38:01.220 --> 38:03.220
By the way, he's stark-naked,

38:03.220 --> 38:08.220
and has a, well, what I hope is a super long dick.

38:08.220 --> 38:10.220
Uncircumcised.

38:10.220 --> 38:12.220
Yeah, and it's kind of uncircumcised, and he's very old,

38:12.220 --> 38:14.220
so it's kind of like, I don't think this is an important detail,

38:14.220 --> 38:16.220
but it is a distracting one, that his foreskin has a sort of like...

38:16.220 --> 38:18.220
Why do you hope it's super long?

38:18.220 --> 38:19.220
Was it long?

38:19.220 --> 38:21.220
Well, because I want...

38:21.220 --> 38:22.220
You want us to think...

38:22.220 --> 38:24.220
I want the average dick size to be smaller than...

38:24.220 --> 38:25.220
Okay.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.220
Yeah.

38:26.220 --> 38:29.220
The smaller, the better.

38:29.220 --> 38:33.220
I mean, what do you want mortgage rates to be?

38:33.220 --> 38:35.220
Lower.

38:35.220 --> 38:36.220
I assume.

38:36.220 --> 38:40.220
I'm totally following it.

38:40.220 --> 38:41.220
Okay.

38:41.220 --> 38:42.220
Keep going, keep going.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.220
You're not even at the halfway point.

38:44.220 --> 38:48.220
He gives a little cautious finger wave about the oranges in Hamburg,

38:48.220 --> 38:53.220
and flaps his flaccid, but long penis against his naked thighs

38:53.220 --> 38:56.220
with a quick twitch of his waist,

38:56.220 --> 39:00.220
and then he reaches down between his legs to underneath his balls somewhere

39:00.220 --> 39:02.220
while looking at the camera.

39:02.220 --> 39:05.220
It gets a curious, contemplative look on his face,

39:05.220 --> 39:09.220
and he's kind of like moving his fingers around a bit back there.

39:09.220 --> 39:12.220
It's a very, very strange, long pause.

39:12.220 --> 39:14.220
You don't know what's really going on,

39:14.220 --> 39:16.220
and then he withdraws a...

39:16.220 --> 39:17.220
Human turd.

39:17.220 --> 39:18.220
...a bowel movement.

39:18.220 --> 39:19.220
No.

39:19.220 --> 39:20.220
Yeah, I know.

39:20.220 --> 39:21.220
Wait, what?

39:21.220 --> 39:22.220
He withdraws a poop?

39:22.220 --> 39:23.220
Yeah.

39:23.220 --> 39:24.220
With his hands?

39:24.220 --> 39:26.220
And then he kind of presents it pridefully,

39:26.220 --> 39:28.220
and then he smears it all over his face.

39:28.220 --> 39:29.220
No!

39:29.220 --> 39:31.220
And he gives a thumbs up.

39:31.220 --> 39:32.220
Is it Gigi Allen?

39:32.220 --> 39:34.220
What the fuck are you watching?

39:34.220 --> 39:35.220
Snake and Martin.

39:35.220 --> 39:37.220
This is somebody you're still friends with?

39:37.220 --> 39:39.220
I will only say one thing about this.

39:39.220 --> 39:42.220
This is the weird thing if you ever see the video.

39:42.220 --> 39:44.220
There's a video.

39:44.220 --> 39:45.220
His poop is...

39:45.220 --> 39:46.220
It's a video, yeah.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.220
What?

39:47.220 --> 39:48.220
He pulls a poop out of his butt?

39:48.220 --> 39:49.220
Yeah.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.220
And puts it on his face.

39:51.220 --> 39:56.220
After he congratulated somebody on their engagement.

39:56.220 --> 40:02.220
I think it's important to note that his poop in that particular video,

40:02.220 --> 40:04.220
and I know I'll describe this in like,

40:04.220 --> 40:05.220
that's not possible,

40:05.220 --> 40:09.220
but it's like, it's so healthy looking

40:09.220 --> 40:12.220
that it's basically not gross

40:12.220 --> 40:14.220
to watch him smeared across his face.

40:14.220 --> 40:18.220
It looks like just how you would imagine

40:18.220 --> 40:20.220
a perfectly healthy bowel movement.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.220
It's just perfectly textured.

40:21.220 --> 40:24.220
It's like a clip part of a turd.

40:24.220 --> 40:27.220
And it almost looks comfortable.

40:27.220 --> 40:29.220
He clearly enjoys doing it.

40:29.220 --> 40:32.220
Tell me again how you came about this video clip.

40:32.220 --> 40:36.220
Cody's old roommate ran into some strangers,

40:36.220 --> 40:38.220
so she got the video from them.

40:38.220 --> 40:41.220
They were affiliated with this wedding engagement

40:41.220 --> 40:43.220
that someone, one of the guests or something,

40:43.220 --> 40:45.220
had tapped this fella.

40:45.220 --> 40:47.220
You're three steps away from an actual human being.

40:47.220 --> 40:49.220
This is not just random internet stuff.

40:49.220 --> 40:51.220
So we tracked him down in the Rick and Morty writer's room,

40:51.220 --> 40:53.220
like we were looking around for this guy,

40:53.220 --> 40:54.220
and somebody found him.

40:54.220 --> 40:55.220
His name is Naked Martin,

40:55.220 --> 40:57.220
and what I kept trying to figure out,

40:57.220 --> 41:00.220
and he's a very sweet seeming fella.

41:00.220 --> 41:01.220
No.

41:01.220 --> 41:03.220
No, I'm telling you.

41:03.220 --> 41:04.220
Don't do it.

41:04.220 --> 41:05.220
No, he's, what?

41:05.220 --> 41:07.220
Don't try to sell us this dude, please.

41:07.220 --> 41:09.220
No, I mean, he's...

41:09.220 --> 41:11.220
Let's not go out like this, Dan.

41:11.220 --> 41:12.220
He's a super pleasant guy.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.220
Not like this.

41:13.220 --> 41:15.220
His bio is like, I'm Naked Martin.

41:15.220 --> 41:17.220
I'm a nudist that loves to have fun.

41:17.220 --> 41:20.220
Right poop on his face for your...

41:20.220 --> 41:23.220
But it's so healthy, this poop.

41:23.220 --> 41:25.220
You got to understand how healthy...

41:25.220 --> 41:28.220
How healthy does a poop have to look to me?

41:28.220 --> 41:30.220
You can buy coffee mugs.

41:30.220 --> 41:33.220
Yeah, and you can also get, like, a video, if you want.

41:33.220 --> 41:37.220
Me and Andi is going to be so mad about this promotion.

41:37.220 --> 41:38.220
Oh, no.

41:38.220 --> 41:41.220
So then Cody, like, she eventually unbeknownst to me,

41:41.220 --> 41:45.220
she orders a video from Naked Martin.

41:45.220 --> 41:47.220
And it was going to be for the anniversary...

41:47.220 --> 41:48.220
Can you play the audio?

41:48.220 --> 41:50.220
You can't play the video, but you can play the audio.

41:50.220 --> 41:51.220
Why can't you play the audio?

41:51.220 --> 41:52.220
I can, but...

41:52.220 --> 41:53.220
Yeah, I mean, it's...

41:53.220 --> 41:54.220
Oh, okay, sorry.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.220
It's the last show.

41:55.220 --> 41:58.220
I just don't know if playing the audio is really that important

41:58.220 --> 42:00.220
versus the amount of time it's going to spend.

42:00.220 --> 42:01.220
I agree.

42:01.220 --> 42:02.220
Well, then don't.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.220
It's your show.

42:03.220 --> 42:04.220
Thank you.

42:04.220 --> 42:05.220
Stop doing things.

42:05.220 --> 42:06.220
Well, I try to...

42:06.220 --> 42:09.220
Are all of his clips him pooping on things?

42:09.220 --> 42:10.220
No.

42:10.220 --> 42:12.220
So, like, we were trying to figure that out.

42:12.220 --> 42:15.220
Like, does this guy like, because it's all about Naked Martin and nudity,

42:15.220 --> 42:22.220
but his logo, it looks like the logo is written in shit.

42:22.220 --> 42:23.220
Yes, it is.

42:23.220 --> 42:24.220
Kind of.

42:24.220 --> 42:26.220
But it also could be hot dogs?

42:26.220 --> 42:27.220
No.

42:27.220 --> 42:28.220
No.

42:28.220 --> 42:30.220
He didn't smear hot dogs on his face.

42:30.220 --> 42:31.220
Hot dogs are...

42:31.220 --> 42:32.220
No, no, no.

42:32.220 --> 42:33.220
Turds.

42:33.220 --> 42:34.220
Turds.

42:34.220 --> 42:35.220
There's turds.

42:35.220 --> 42:39.220
Why don't you know the difference between hot dogs and shit?

42:39.220 --> 42:40.220
Yeah.

42:40.220 --> 42:42.220
How did that happen?

42:42.220 --> 42:44.220
I think it's possible for a graphic designer to not know the difference.

42:44.220 --> 42:48.220
I'd like to give a special shout out to people that traveled here to see this final show.

42:48.220 --> 42:49.220
Okay.

42:49.220 --> 42:50.220
Well, here's the thing.

42:50.220 --> 42:53.220
Keep going, talking about the video.

42:53.220 --> 42:57.220
I mean, I want so badly to just, like, hand it off to Jeff now and go,

42:57.220 --> 42:59.220
like, no, no, yeah, let's abort this immediately.

42:59.220 --> 43:00.220
Let's clear it.

43:00.220 --> 43:01.220
No, but what...

43:01.220 --> 43:02.220
So, go on.

43:02.220 --> 43:03.220
Oh, you have questions about this guy?

43:03.220 --> 43:04.220
I mean...

43:04.220 --> 43:05.220
I have a hundred questions.

43:05.220 --> 43:06.220
Even though we're doing a show?

43:06.220 --> 43:07.220
Yes.

43:07.220 --> 43:14.220
I mean, my first question is, what was the origin story of you finding this person,

43:14.220 --> 43:17.220
and how did this become a part of your life?

43:17.220 --> 43:18.220
So, you're interested?

43:18.220 --> 43:19.220
Yes.

43:19.220 --> 43:20.220
Okay.

43:20.220 --> 43:23.220
Oh, I'm in.

43:23.220 --> 43:26.220
So, the...

43:26.220 --> 43:30.220
Cody comes up to me a month later, a couple of weeks later,

43:30.220 --> 43:32.220
and she's kind of sadly, she goes like,

43:32.220 --> 43:37.220
I was gonna, I got something for our engagement, which is not until Christmas time,

43:37.220 --> 43:43.220
our anniversary for our engagement, but it didn't go as well as I thought it would.

43:43.220 --> 43:46.220
And so, I'm just gonna give it to you now.

43:46.220 --> 43:52.220
And it's naked Martin is sitting and kneeling in a kitchen.

43:52.220 --> 43:57.220
Everything about the video is like, the first one, I gotta go back and describe the first one,

43:57.220 --> 44:02.220
because it's like, he's out in like, a beautiful lush, day-lit garden.

44:02.220 --> 44:05.220
Like, all you can see behind him is just foliage.

44:05.220 --> 44:09.220
And he's just, he's very chipper and crisp and the video,

44:09.220 --> 44:14.220
and as I described, like, from the texture of the shit to his deployment of it,

44:14.220 --> 44:19.220
everything is just sort of like, it looks as if he's done it a thousand times and loves it.

44:19.220 --> 44:21.220
He's smiling, he's glowing.

44:21.220 --> 44:24.220
And it's his own poop.

44:24.220 --> 44:37.220
No, he reaches between his naked legs where he's cleverly releasing a bag of someone else's shit,

44:37.220 --> 44:43.220
because he wants to save himself a gross and tedious task of withdrawing his own.

44:43.220 --> 44:45.220
Yes, I think it's his own shit.

44:45.220 --> 44:49.220
I'm trying to think what's worse, his own poop or somebody else's poop.

44:49.220 --> 44:55.220
But it is notable that it's all so cleanly done in that first video that that is a question that comes to your mind,

44:55.220 --> 44:58.220
is like, is that really, can you just do that?

44:58.220 --> 45:01.220
Can you just reach back there and like, I'll wrap it from a hat.

45:01.220 --> 45:05.220
Like, it's just in one piece, like, there's nothing gross about it.

45:05.220 --> 45:10.220
Why is there nothing gross about it?

45:10.220 --> 45:18.220
It's shocking, but it's not, I think you'll find like, stuff like, with shit is like,

45:18.220 --> 45:22.220
it's the details, it's the sloppy organic details.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.220
That's what we don't like about shit.

45:24.220 --> 45:28.220
It's like chaos and it's like everything that life is done with.

45:28.220 --> 45:32.220
And as such, it behaves in no predictable way and things.

45:32.220 --> 45:35.220
And then when you draw like a cartoon turd, you can, you don't like,

45:35.220 --> 45:41.220
most people don't like react to a drawing of a turd that looks like a little Hershey's kiss with stink lines coming off of it.

45:41.220 --> 45:44.220
It's like, we don't gag because it makes us think of real shit.

45:44.220 --> 45:49.220
Like, but anyway, so like, I'm telling you, the guy's turd was a cartoon.

45:49.220 --> 45:51.220
So then Cody's video.

45:51.220 --> 45:55.220
So it's like, he says, he's kneeling in a kitchen.

45:55.220 --> 45:58.220
So it's already like, ah, just feels, why is he kneeling?

45:58.220 --> 46:03.220
And there's like, there's like sauce pans hanging from it.

46:03.220 --> 46:06.220
Do we know, do we know it's his kitchen or is he somebody else's kitchen?

46:06.220 --> 46:13.220
I hope that he gets so many of these videos ordered that every weekend he rents a B&B and knocks them all out

46:13.220 --> 46:20.220
and just leaves a $500 tip for the cleaning staff and just walks away the happiest guy in the world.

46:20.220 --> 46:25.220
I really am telling you, if you see this guy's bio, you're going to, you're going to, you're going to love this guy.

46:25.220 --> 46:29.220
He's like, he represents all that is like, like unassuming and pure.

46:29.220 --> 46:31.220
He's, he's hurting nobody.

46:31.220 --> 46:34.220
And there's not enough people like him in the world.

46:34.220 --> 46:35.220
There I said it.

46:35.220 --> 46:40.220
But, but what I could never figure out is like, well, does he love, does he love the shit stuff?

46:40.220 --> 46:43.220
Or is that what people are like requesting?

46:43.220 --> 46:45.220
Because he says like, I'll do anything.

46:45.220 --> 46:50.220
And then our people like rub shit on your face and he's like, well, I'll do that too.

46:50.220 --> 46:51.220
Or is he like, I love shit.

46:51.220 --> 46:54.220
Like you can't see anything at his site about like shit play.

46:54.220 --> 47:01.220
But then, so then Cody ordered this video and it says, he goes, he's kneeling in the kitchen and he says, Dan,

47:01.220 --> 47:05.220
it's been one year since you said yes to Cody proposing to you.

47:05.220 --> 47:09.220
And she just wants you to know that she thinks you're the shit.

47:09.220 --> 47:12.220
And what?

47:12.220 --> 47:17.220
And, and Cody did not ask him to do this part, but he now turns around.

47:17.220 --> 47:20.220
And this is definitely his shit.

47:20.220 --> 47:22.220
Oh, look, it's, it's Jesse.

47:22.220 --> 47:23.220
Jesse camp.

47:23.220 --> 47:24.220
What's up, Jesse?

47:24.220 --> 47:25.220
Yeah.

47:25.220 --> 47:26.220
Wait, wait.

47:26.220 --> 47:28.220
So she commissioned this guy.

47:28.220 --> 47:29.220
Yeah.

47:29.220 --> 47:30.220
So he turns around.

47:30.220 --> 47:31.220
She commissioned this shit to be taken.

47:31.220 --> 47:35.220
He turns around on his knees and then it starts to do the same thing he did.

47:35.220 --> 47:37.220
But now it's a completely different view.

47:37.220 --> 47:38.220
It's no longer a mystery.

47:38.220 --> 47:39.220
Right.

47:39.220 --> 47:43.220
It's, and it's, and, and the rabbit does not just come out of a hat.

47:43.220 --> 47:52.220
Like there's a, there's a piece of rabbit that falls on the, the hardwood floor with an audible kind of sound.

47:52.220 --> 48:00.220
And then he turns back around with his shit now in his hand and he, Cody had asked him, she was really sad.

48:00.220 --> 48:04.220
That's why she just, she just waved the white flag and gave it to me a month early.

48:04.220 --> 48:09.220
Cause it's like, she, she is like, it's, he's, I was like, what is he doing?

48:09.220 --> 48:12.220
He's supposed to be a heart.

48:12.220 --> 48:19.220
He's trying to, he's, he's like trying to draw a heart on his chest.

48:19.220 --> 48:20.220
With, with his own poop?

48:20.220 --> 48:25.220
It just looks like this circle and it's just like, there's so much texture to the chest hair.

48:25.220 --> 48:33.220
And, and so, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then he gives a thumbs up and then he presses a button on,

48:33.220 --> 48:36.220
on something next to him that is apparently supposed to stop the video.

48:36.220 --> 48:39.220
And then there's like a eight second pause.

48:39.220 --> 48:45.220
And then he, and then he kind of does a couple of false starts and then he starts in a, and then the video ends.

48:45.220 --> 48:50.220
So the whole thing is just sort of like, you're just like, man, I hope he's happy.

48:50.220 --> 48:51.220
Yeah.

48:51.220 --> 48:52.220
Yeah.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.220
Like I want to think that he's living the best life.

48:54.220 --> 48:56.220
How much did Cody pay him for this?

48:56.220 --> 48:58.220
Is this a commission?

48:58.220 --> 49:01.220
80 pounds, which is 103 American dollars.

49:01.220 --> 49:02.220
That's not enough money.

49:02.220 --> 49:03.220
No, it's not.

49:03.220 --> 49:04.220
It is not.

49:04.220 --> 49:06.220
That's the thing that makes me assume that he likes it.

49:06.220 --> 49:09.220
Or I think it might be a little bit too much money.

49:09.220 --> 49:16.220
I think he should be charging $1,000 minimum to, it costs $100 to clean that shit up, man.

49:16.220 --> 49:22.220
He costs $100 to clean that shit up.

49:22.220 --> 49:31.220
That's, that's what gives me the, the hope that I think, I think he must, he must be enjoying it because otherwise he charged $50,000.

49:31.220 --> 49:32.220
Like we would, right?

49:32.220 --> 49:35.220
How much would we charge to rub our own shit on it?

49:35.220 --> 49:37.220
Mike Eagle, how much would you charge for that?

49:37.220 --> 49:38.220
How much?

49:38.220 --> 49:39.220
If you had to do it.

49:39.220 --> 49:40.220
What's your base rate?

49:40.220 --> 49:42.220
I had to do it and I had to make a video of it.

49:42.220 --> 49:43.220
Yeah.

49:43.220 --> 49:44.220
Base rate.

49:44.220 --> 49:47.220
In a normal video format that can be fucking shown to anybody.

49:47.220 --> 49:48.220
Right.

49:48.220 --> 49:49.220
Yeah.

49:49.220 --> 49:50.220
You could be naked Mike Eagle.

49:50.220 --> 49:51.220
Base now on.

49:51.220 --> 49:52.220
Naked shit rubbing Mike Eagle.

49:52.220 --> 49:53.220
$74 million.

49:53.220 --> 50:00.220
See, that's a guy that's like, yeah, because you're, you're, like I said, when you do what

50:00.220 --> 50:03.220
you love, right, you don't, you don't have to work a day in your life.

50:03.220 --> 50:08.220
And you're like, your, your goal as his mind is like, yeah, there's no, there's no price

50:08.220 --> 50:12.220
you could put on your ability to be open Mike and do what you want.

50:12.220 --> 50:20.220
It would need to be so much money for you to shatter that all that you'd have to be set up for life.

50:20.220 --> 50:21.220
Yeah.

50:21.220 --> 50:25.220
And if you did anything for 10,000 hours, you become an expert at it.

50:25.220 --> 50:26.220
Yeah.

50:26.220 --> 50:27.220
And he said,

50:27.220 --> 50:28.220
Should be paid for expertise.

50:28.220 --> 50:29.220
Yeah.

50:29.220 --> 50:30.220
Yeah.

50:30.220 --> 50:32.220
He references a thing on his website about.

50:32.220 --> 50:33.220
Why is 74 million?

50:33.220 --> 50:34.220
That's a, that's a weird specific number.

50:34.220 --> 50:40.220
It's the highest number I could make with my mouth right now.

50:40.220 --> 50:44.220
I think I, I, I feel that I, I've actually rift that number once I think on this stage,

50:44.220 --> 50:47.220
or I might have said 175, but it's like 70.

50:47.220 --> 50:50.220
It's like got the most syllables or something.

50:50.220 --> 50:51.220
75 million.

50:51.220 --> 50:58.220
To me, it feels like that amount of money you could even if you weren't a financial wizard,

50:58.220 --> 51:01.220
you could figure out a way to live off of interest.

51:01.220 --> 51:02.220
Yes.

51:02.220 --> 51:03.220
That's like that.

51:03.220 --> 51:08.220
Like maybe you have the small house in Sherman Oaks, but you're like only I just put the 75

51:08.220 --> 51:13.220
million on a pile and the pile just radiates money that I live off of every day.

51:13.220 --> 51:15.220
I probably wouldn't do that.

51:15.220 --> 51:18.220
I'd probably buy a fucking gold boat that sank.

51:18.220 --> 51:20.220
But then you got a gold boat.

51:20.220 --> 51:23.220
Then you got to make another shit video.

51:23.220 --> 51:25.220
I made a gold boat.

51:25.220 --> 51:28.220
Yeah, you got to go on that shit video money.

51:28.220 --> 51:33.220
Oh, one more detail, because is that, is that Cody had, you know, she gave him a shout out

51:33.220 --> 51:36.220
or whatever she showed, like a frame grab or something like that on her Instagram.

51:36.220 --> 51:40.220
And he, he messaged her and said, thanks for the shout out.

51:40.220 --> 51:44.220
Like, like he was appreciative of her getting the word out, lest anybody think for some reason

51:44.220 --> 51:49.220
that a guy that sells this service wants to keep it on the down low and is somehow going

51:49.220 --> 51:52.220
to be hampered by this getting out.

51:52.220 --> 51:54.220
You know how much shit is on his phone screen?

51:54.220 --> 51:58.220
There's just shit particles all over his fucking phone screen.

51:58.220 --> 52:03.220
He's, he's, I'm telling you, you're going to, I feel bad that this is the last episode

52:03.220 --> 52:09.220
because it's because in episode 361, there would be a lot of people coming back on the show

52:09.220 --> 52:12.220
to say, I can't believe it, but you're right.

52:12.220 --> 52:17.220
He seems fastidious and pleasant and I'm in his, I'm rooting for him.

52:17.220 --> 52:20.220
He seems like a wonderful man that I want to be happy.

52:20.220 --> 52:24.220
Levy, Levy just came out and showed me a clip and his, if that's his flaccid dick,

52:24.220 --> 52:28.220
it's, it's a pretty, it's a pretty good size, pretty like, it's a big dick.

52:28.220 --> 52:29.220
Yeah.

52:29.220 --> 52:30.220
Yeah.

52:30.220 --> 52:36.220
His willingness to be nude, I get.

52:36.220 --> 52:38.220
He probably does that for free.

52:38.220 --> 52:39.220
Yeah.

52:39.220 --> 52:40.220
Why the poop?

52:40.220 --> 52:41.220
I don't get it.

52:41.220 --> 52:42.220
My friends that were in a band.

52:42.220 --> 52:43.220
You're talking about it.

52:43.220 --> 52:49.220
My friends, I grew up with, there's a band called Croms, a C-R-O-M with an umla for no reason

52:49.220 --> 52:53.220
and they're like a grindcore, like death metal band.

52:53.220 --> 52:55.220
And you know Crom?

52:55.220 --> 52:56.220
Oh fuck, yeah.

52:56.220 --> 52:58.220
Oh fuck, one person, that's awesome.

52:58.220 --> 52:59.220
Yeah.

52:59.220 --> 53:04.220
They, they would, they would throw these parties and they had a DVD, no, sorry, a VHS tape

53:04.220 --> 53:08.220
and it said 666, do not watch on it.

53:08.220 --> 53:11.220
And it was a poop, it was a poop video.

53:11.220 --> 53:14.220
And if you watched it, you barfed.

53:14.220 --> 53:18.220
Like, like, you, like, it was the most volatile thing I've ever seen.

53:18.220 --> 53:23.220
There was a guy, it was not black and white, but the color was so bad it was almost black

53:23.220 --> 53:24.220
and white.

53:24.220 --> 53:27.220
And VHS, yes, thank you sir.

53:27.220 --> 53:30.220
Look at this, you faking.

53:30.220 --> 53:32.220
You faking.

53:32.220 --> 53:35.220
Anybody could have said VHS.

53:35.220 --> 53:36.220
Yeah.

53:36.220 --> 53:39.220
Name one Crom song, bro.

53:39.220 --> 53:42.220
Name one Crom song.

53:42.220 --> 53:44.220
Name one Crom song, bro.

53:44.220 --> 53:47.220
Name one Crom song.

53:47.220 --> 53:49.220
If you, if you, you got to go find Crom.

53:49.220 --> 53:55.220
They started a band as a joke, but they, Crom was a cone of the barbarians god.

53:55.220 --> 54:00.220
And so one of their song was Fuck You Wood Pusher because he had to push a stick around

54:00.220 --> 54:02.220
and there was a grace.

54:02.220 --> 54:05.220
Don't you say nothing.

54:05.220 --> 54:07.220
What song is called Grace Jones Headbutt?

54:07.220 --> 54:09.220
Oh, Grace Jones Headbutt, yeah, Grace Jones Headbutt, yeah.

54:09.220 --> 54:10.220
Oh man.

54:10.220 --> 54:11.220
It goes like this.

54:11.220 --> 54:14.220
Grace Jones Headbutt.

54:14.220 --> 54:15.220
Yeah.

54:15.220 --> 54:17.220
I was here.

54:17.220 --> 54:19.220
You know, Diddy did the remix.

54:19.220 --> 54:22.220
But they had, they had these parties.

54:22.220 --> 54:26.220
Well, one of the guys in the band is named Will and his name was the Will of Crom because

54:26.220 --> 54:27.220
he was a god.

54:27.220 --> 54:33.220
And these motherfuckers did every drug and there was a VHS tape.

54:33.220 --> 54:36.220
666, do not watch.

54:36.220 --> 54:41.220
And people would just see it and go, oh, I'm going to put that on.

54:41.220 --> 54:49.220
And there was a dude bent over on all fours and a girl next to his butt.

54:49.220 --> 54:52.220
Yes.

54:52.220 --> 54:57.220
And she, and he started, he started the poop and she ate it up like it was like soft serve

54:57.220 --> 55:00.220
ice cream.

55:00.220 --> 55:06.220
Congratulations on playing out here.

55:06.220 --> 55:08.220
Oh, oh, oh, cheap laughs.

55:08.220 --> 55:09.220
Oh, I love them.

55:09.220 --> 55:11.220
Oh, they're like scrambled eggs.

55:11.220 --> 55:15.220
I can attack a whole day now.

55:15.220 --> 55:17.220
Carbohydrate surface laughs.

55:17.220 --> 55:21.220
Fucking Snickers bar blood sugar laughs.

55:21.220 --> 55:26.220
Well, I mean, long story short, she looks, she looks pretty unhappy.

55:26.220 --> 55:31.220
And you watch that, you watch four seconds of that and you have to walk outside and vomit.

55:31.220 --> 55:35.220
And yet there's an audience for that sort of stuff.

55:35.220 --> 55:36.220
And you found it.

55:36.220 --> 55:38.220
And now you and Cody share that with each other.

55:38.220 --> 55:41.220
I believe I've seen that video or one like it.

55:41.220 --> 55:44.220
And I remember it physically gagging because it is the site of the thing that makes you,

55:44.220 --> 55:45.220
it makes you rest.

55:45.220 --> 55:48.220
Here's the bummer.

55:48.220 --> 55:54.220
Hey, here's the, here's the, here's where it gets troublesome.

55:54.220 --> 55:55.220
Telling on yourself.

55:55.220 --> 56:03.220
If you're Canadian or UK, the real sad part is that they don't like it.

56:03.220 --> 56:08.220
If they were injured, you're like, okay, these people just, they like to party.

56:08.220 --> 56:09.220
Like that's their thing.

56:09.220 --> 56:12.220
But this guy, this guy doesn't like it.

56:12.220 --> 56:17.220
Is he going, I'm so sorry.

56:17.220 --> 56:18.220
I'm so sorry.

56:18.220 --> 56:20.220
I just remember the, the, so sorry.

56:20.220 --> 56:21.220
We got to make rent.

56:21.220 --> 56:22.220
Are you all right back there?

56:22.220 --> 56:24.220
There was 100% sadness.

56:24.220 --> 56:25.220
There was all sadness.

56:25.220 --> 56:29.220
But then they go back at it and they do it again.

56:29.220 --> 56:31.220
And it's like, it's just, come on, you guys.

56:31.220 --> 56:33.220
You watched all of that too?

56:33.220 --> 56:34.220
Huh?

56:34.220 --> 56:37.220
So you watched all of that?

56:37.220 --> 56:38.220
Yeah.

56:38.220 --> 56:42.220
Well, who likes to party?

56:42.220 --> 56:51.220
I would say, I would say that this clip had third act troubles.

56:51.220 --> 56:55.220
I think the third act kind of broke down.

56:55.220 --> 56:57.220
Don't watch a poop videos where I'm telling you.

56:57.220 --> 57:03.220
On that same VHS tape, is there then a like little person?

57:03.220 --> 57:04.220
No.

57:04.220 --> 57:05.220
Okay.

57:05.220 --> 57:06.220
Do you know what I'm talking about?

57:06.220 --> 57:07.220
Oh yeah, yeah.

57:07.220 --> 57:08.220
Okay.

57:08.220 --> 57:09.220
That was a tape you had.

57:09.220 --> 57:10.220
Yeah.

57:10.220 --> 57:11.220
That was a tape that I had.

57:11.220 --> 57:12.220
Okay.

57:12.220 --> 57:15.220
Where, where, where, it was just like.

57:15.220 --> 57:18.220
I started to feel like I was a bad person for a while.

57:18.220 --> 57:19.220
No, no, no.

57:19.220 --> 57:22.220
There was a, we were watching a tape that was just, it started off as public access like

57:22.220 --> 57:26.220
stuff that just got weirder and weirder and more and more degraded as clips.

57:26.220 --> 57:31.220
Where it was like bad stand up auditions and then all of a sudden it turns into black and

57:31.220 --> 57:38.220
white and there was a little person dressed up and make up and address and doing like

57:38.220 --> 57:41.220
tap dancing and was really.

57:41.220 --> 57:44.220
But, but, but on the same tape, I'm talking about it too.

57:44.220 --> 57:50.220
I was trying to like, I was trying to triangulate a tape that I recall having discussed.

57:50.220 --> 57:53.220
I've never watched a poop video with you two.

57:53.220 --> 57:54.220
I was a separate poop.

57:54.220 --> 57:58.220
I'm starting to feel like y'all are the police and this is a lie you're telling me to give

57:58.220 --> 58:00.220
me to confess to something.

58:00.220 --> 58:01.220
Yeah.

58:01.220 --> 58:04.220
I didn't fucking do it.

58:04.220 --> 58:05.220
Okay.

58:05.220 --> 58:10.220
No, you ate the poop now.

58:10.220 --> 58:11.220
Come on.

58:11.220 --> 58:12.220
All right.

58:12.220 --> 58:13.220
Moving on.

58:13.220 --> 58:14.220
I think that's.

58:14.220 --> 58:16.220
Fingerprints are on the toilet bowl.

58:16.220 --> 58:23.220
I was, I was playing, so Cody and you know, Cody are my niece to be my common law niece.

58:23.220 --> 58:24.220
Maya.

58:24.220 --> 58:25.220
What is she?

58:25.220 --> 58:26.220
Three.

58:26.220 --> 58:29.220
I think she's three now.

58:29.220 --> 58:31.220
Absolutely adorable.

58:31.220 --> 58:33.220
Common law niece.

58:33.220 --> 58:38.220
Because we haven't set a date for our wedding, but like, you know, she's as good as my niece.

58:38.220 --> 58:40.220
She's as good as niece.

58:40.220 --> 58:42.220
And I, it's weird.

58:42.220 --> 58:46.220
I don't know how to describe her title, you know, so I just keep going like my niece to

58:46.220 --> 58:47.220
be.

58:47.220 --> 58:49.220
Pre niece.

58:49.220 --> 58:51.220
Pre niece.

58:51.220 --> 58:53.220
She calls me uncle.

58:53.220 --> 58:55.220
Yeah.

58:55.220 --> 59:05.220
But we, we, she like, we were playing with her, me and Cody a couple of nights ago and

59:05.220 --> 59:11.220
then, you know, like, turns into like a make believe kind of game about how Cody's sick

59:11.220 --> 59:19.220
and she's a doctor, but she was like, she was like, it was just such a weird like, because

59:19.220 --> 59:26.220
I, she kept like, Cody and I were brother and sister and a little three year old Maya

59:26.220 --> 59:28.220
was, was calling her.

59:28.220 --> 59:32.220
She was, she was acting as the doctor that was taking care of Cody, but she was also

59:32.220 --> 59:35.220
both our daddy and our mommy.

59:35.220 --> 59:41.220
And she kept sending me to school and it was really weird because she had all of these

59:41.220 --> 59:47.220
like, she was like, she, she had no patience for any kind of like, she would, she would

59:47.220 --> 59:49.220
just go, guess what?

59:49.220 --> 59:51.220
To Cody, she's like, you're really sick.

59:51.220 --> 59:52.220
Oh no.

59:52.220 --> 59:53.220
You're really sick.

59:53.220 --> 59:57.220
And then she'd look at me and go like, you got to go to school.

59:57.220 --> 01:00:00.220
And then I go, I go like, oh, okay, I'm going to go to school.

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.220
And she's like, okay, now you're at school.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.220
And like, it's over there.

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:08.220
It's sitting in the corner and then she's like, learn your ABCs.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.220
You're really sick.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.220
And then, and then she's like, okay, school's over.

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.220
Like, like, I was like, I just got here.

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:21.220
And then I come back and it was just like this weird cycle, like this weird simulator

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:27.220
that was being run by this three year old who doesn't understand any rules about timing,

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:35.220
overkill, sadism, munchausen by proxy syndrome, which was a big theme because she kept making

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.220
Cody sicker and sicker.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:46.220
And she was, but it was, like she was, she was like, she gradually like kept escalating in terms of like the empathy that she was having for Cody.

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:50.220
Like it was like the game she wanted to play was like that she was like, she was like, it's okay.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.220
It's okay.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:54.220
And Cody, Cody was like, oh, I feel sick.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:01:03.220
And then she was like, it finally like, after like five iterations of like my weird life where I am, as I kept commenting,

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:11.220
I'm like, I feel like I'm wasting the better parts of my life while my sister's at home dying.

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:15.220
I'm learning the ABCs and my teacher's three.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.220
So like half of the alphabet is QRS.

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:23.220
Like, she's an A, B, Q, R, S, T, B, I, but W, Q, R, S.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:27.220
Like she doesn't, I mean, she's whoop, whoop.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:34.220
But it's, it's her curriculum and it's a, it's a school district with one student and the school day is 10 seconds long.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:39.220
But it's like, after five iterations, they come back to the bed, which is our house.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:44.220
And, and, and, and Maya looks at Cody and goes, hey, guess what?

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.220
Cody's like, what?

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.220
He's like, you're dying.

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.220
Oh, no.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.220
What the fuck?

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.220
You're going to die.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.220
And Cody's like, oh, no.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:57.220
And I'm like, does that mean I can stop going to school?

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.220
And she goes, yeah.

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.220
Yeah, she's dying.

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.220
So you stay home from school.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.220
And then, and then she like, she nurses Cody through.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.220
She's like, it's okay.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.220
It's all right.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.220
It's going to be okay.

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.220
And then, and then Cody died.

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.220
She's like, she goes, guess what?

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.220
What?

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:16.220
You're dead.

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.220
And then she said, so then Cody's dead.

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.220
She killed Cody.

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:25.220
And then, and then I was like, wow, do we call a mortician?

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.220
Or I don't know what I'm now allowed to.

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.220
Like, I don't know.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:32.220
Her parents will be like, you taught her about death.

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.220
She thinks that's sleeping.

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.220
I don't, I don't, I don't, now I don't know what I'm like.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.220
And then she's like, let's give her some more medicine.

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:42.220
And she's like, she's like, like, like, there's like, like lotion,

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.220
because it's a hotel room.

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:47.220
It puts lotion on Cody's forehead that's like medicine for dying.

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.220
And, and Cody, like blinks her eyes.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.220
It goes like, I'm alive.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.220
I'm alive.

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.220
And Maya goes, hey, guess what?

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.220
What?

01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.220
You have to go to school.

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.220
Yeah.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.220
It was, it's pretty fun.

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.220
I mean, I, sorry.

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.220
Is she a good person or a bad person?

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.220
I don't, I don't know.

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:16.220
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't actually believe that human beings

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.220
have a moral conscience.

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:19.220
I believe that we.

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:24.220
Where in a three year old get like, like the motivation to say you're dying

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.220
or you're sick?

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.220
Like, did she go through something like recently?

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.220
Well, I don't, well, I don't know.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:32.220
I'm not a good enough uncle to know if maybe she lost a goldfish and like,

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:36.220
had a, or, but she, you know, like, like somewhere between all the peppa pigs

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:40.220
and the, and the, and the movies that her parents are watching or like all the

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.220
other kids in kindergarten or whatever.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.220
It's like, you know, you're picking up on our mythology, which is about death

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.220
and life.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.220
Does she watch YouTube?

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.220
I hope not.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.220
But, but like, her parents are really good at keeping this.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.220
Did she ever take a turd out and start making a heart on somebody's chest?

01:03:54.220 --> 01:04:01.220
You know, but yeah, Sheila, I, I, I, I, I, I, if I was ever going to have a kid,

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:06.220
it would only be out of the selfish motivation of like, what a great like audience.

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.220
Like there, there's just like your, your bits can be so, you can do such bad.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:14.220
I got a bit that I do with my nephew that I've been doing for about three years now,

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:18.220
where, whenever I see him, I go, Hey, where's my money?

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:22.220
And he's like, he's like six.

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:24.220
And he's like, I don't know what you're talking about.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:29.220
And I go, no, you said that the last time, where's my money?

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:32.220
And he's like, I don't have any money.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.220
I go, you better get my money now.

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.220
And it's parents are just like, I'm so confused.

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:41.220
What is, is this a joke?

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.220
Do you ever say the amount or is it just vague?

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:47.220
No, no, no.

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.220
I want my money.

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.220
Where's my money?

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:55.220
And at one time, for some reason, I had like a wad of cash in my wallet.

01:04:55.220 --> 01:05:02.220
I had 20s and ones and, and I opened it up and I go, Hey, I'm just kidding here.

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:03.220
Let me give it.

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.220
And then I pulled out a receipt and I gave it.

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:08.220
Hey, can you throw this out for me?

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.220
That's really mean.

01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:13.220
Yeah.

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.220
It's a receipt from Gilson's.

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.220
Can you throw this shit out for me?

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:22.220
My nieces and nephews have this game called there's Uncle Brandon.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:25.220
And for some reason they played it in front of me.

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:30.220
And it's whenever they see a black homeless person.

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.220
What? Somebody tell him.

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.220
Thank you all so much.

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.220
I hope your nieces and nephews are black.

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.220
Because then it helps a little bit.

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:46.220
I brought my way into a white family as soon as I got money.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:50.220
And do you just think, oh, do you try to educate?

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:53.220
I said, who the fuck taught you this game?

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.220
Yeah.

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:58.220
And it was my sister.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:05.220
My fucking sister was like, there's Uncle Brandon out there in LA homeless.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:09.220
Oh, she's so provincial and you're Mr. LA.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.220
Don't you always just wear a suit all the time?

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.220
You always look good.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:16.220
You see a lot of homeless black dudes in blazers.

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.220
Don't lie. Don't lie.

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.220
You do. You see a lot of well-dressed homeless people.

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.220
I tell him about the t-shirt underneath.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.220
You got to look past the blazer.

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:29.220
If it's like a Britney Spears concert shirt from 93.

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.220
Congratulations.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.220
You wore a motherfucking bow tie.

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.220
That's a tight one. That's not a clip.

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:36.220
That's a real bow tie.

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.220
It's a real bow tie.

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:42.220
One, you know, Nation of Islam taught me that Allah has many things planned.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.220
Right.

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:48.220
Yeah, you know how to tie a bow tie and how to make a bean pie?

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.220
Final calls will be passed out throughout the audience.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:54.220
These people don't know what the fuck the final call is.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.220
But God love you. Google it.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:59.220
You guys referenced the five percenters in the...

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:01.220
Oh, that was me. I brought up the five percenters

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.220
and I've been watching the Wu-Tang show on Hulu.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.220
It's great.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.220
So I've been thinking about the five percenters.

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.220
Actually, I think it's really bad, but I like it a lot.

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.220
Oh, really? You think it's bad?

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:13.220
I do. I think, like, you know, I like them.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.220
Yeah.

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:18.220
So I like seeing all the fantastical stories that didn't really happen in the projects with them.

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.220
Yeah.

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.220
But there's a lot of not great acting in it.

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:24.220
Oh, all right.

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:26.220
I thought you'd seen it, right? Try it.

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:28.220
I loved it. I thought it was really good.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:31.220
You were acting like you hadn't seen it, but I thought you recommended it to me.

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:32.220
I did recommend it.

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.220
It's good. Do you like them?

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.220
I thought it was really...

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.220
I know I'm supposed to. I don't...

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:37.220
You don't really?

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.220
If you don't really like them, you might not really like the show.

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.220
Well, I don't...

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.220
I'm not familiar enough with anybody outside Tori Amos to be like,

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:45.220
I like him. I don't like him.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.220
Right.

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:50.220
Would you watch a Tori Amos, a part of fictional one-hour drama on Hulu?

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:52.220
Oh, fuck yeah, he would.

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:54.220
What would it be called?

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:59.220
Probably like cabbages in Turtles Racing or something,

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.220
and people would be like, what are you talking about?

01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:04.220
And she'd be like, that's my girls.

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:05.220
Hey, Spencer.

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:08.220
What up? Hey, guys.

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:11.220
Since we're wrapping up the old Harmontowns,

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.220
we found you in a lucky moment.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:18.220
What's your feelings about walking away from this?

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.220
I hate it.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.220
Yeah?

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.220
Yeah, I'm sad, you guys.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.220
Oh, no.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.220
Are you really?

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.220
You're dying.

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.220
Oh, no.

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:31.220
See, I think you're being sarcastic.

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:34.220
Because this isn't very different than you sound when you're ecstatic.

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.220
No, I'm sad.

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:41.220
I can't tell if you're being for real or you're doing a bit right now.

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.220
It sucks, you guys.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.220
I think he's being for real.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.220
It's true.

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:50.220
I'm being honest.

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:55.220
It feels like only yesterday that you raised your hand when Dan asked,

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.220
is anybody here a dungeon master and you raised your hand,

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.220
and then here we are after all these years.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.220
It really does feel like yesterday.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.220
Am I ever going to see you again?

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.220
No.

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.220
This is...

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.220
I mean, here's the thing.

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.220
It's like, I don't know if I'm ever going to see any of you guys ever again.

01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:12.220
I'm going to send you guys like a...

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:14.220
This is my way of hanging out with you.

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.220
Well, Spencer and I, we don't have the name of it yet.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:21.220
We don't know exactly when and where and what, but we have a venue, and Spencer and I...

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.220
We have a venue?

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:24.220
We do have a venue.

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:26.220
What is it?

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.220
I'll drop it.

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.220
Follow us, Spencer and I, and somebody else.

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:34.220
It's going to be like, we're going to make a new podcast,

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.220
and you guys are all welcome to come to it.

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:38.220
Oh, shit.

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:42.220
We'll be promoting it at the Mexican place next door,

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.220
which I hope is not your venue because they're very rarely open.

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:47.220
No, no, it's...

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:48.220
It is odd.

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.220
I would have learned their name.

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:50.220
It's a very show-busy place.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.220
It's going to be groovy.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.220
It might be monthly.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.220
It might not be weekly, but we'll make it good, and you guys can all come and...

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:59.220
I would like to request that it be all commercials,

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:03.220
because the thing that I regret most about ending this podcast is the commercials.

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:06.220
That's what I'm going to miss the most is doing ads with Spencer.

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.220
It's the fucking best part of the thing.

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:11.220
Church and Spencer doing the commercials is the fucking greatest thing.

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:15.220
It would be impossible for us to continue to do that in any capacity.

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.220
What we do have to do, no matter where we go,

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:20.220
we have to steal this desk from a dentistry tapewriter.

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.220
That's fair.

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.220
So you can sit there with your hand on your head.

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.220
Why the hand on the head thing?

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.220
What's this posture?

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:29.220
The answer to that question, all questions can be revealed...

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:30.220
On the new podcast.

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.220
On the...

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.220
No, I did.

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:35.220
I wrote a D&D module, though, that people should...

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.220
Whoa!

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:42.220
It's called Color of Chaos, and it's on DMs Guild.

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:44.220
What if we just call it...

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.220
What if we just call it Town?

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.220
There's nobody's name involved.

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:48.220
It's just Town.

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:51.220
Wow, what if we did the thing that I said on air before?

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:52.220
Yes, exactly.

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.220
That would be a funny joke.

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.220
I'm just trying to remind everybody.

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.220
No, I know.

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.220
It's a good thing.

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.220
It's happening already.

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.220
All I'm saying is that buy my module.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.220
Buy your module?

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:03.220
Give me money.

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:06.220
That's the only reason I'm here.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.220
I don't care about any of you fucks.

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.220
I'm just here for the fucking money.

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:11.220
All right.

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:13.220
I want my paycheck, son.

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.220
Love an honest man.

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.220
Get that money, homie.

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.220
That's what I'm sad about.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.220
All this fucking money.

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:21.220
What's up?

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.220
We got Dave Kline over here, everybody.

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.220
You give me a...

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.220
What up, Dave Kline?

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.220
What's up?

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.220
How's it going, baby?

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:29.220
It's a beautiful thing.

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:31.220
Congratulations to a final Harmontown.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:35.220
To a very special sanctum you carved out with your own mitts

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.220
without any fucking permission.

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:40.220
Shout out to an international audience

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:42.220
of maniacs and beautiful people and spirits

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:45.220
that you can hear from across oceans.

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.220
Whoa.

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:50.220
I heard it personally from 3,000 miles away

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:52.220
from the rugged hills of Shaolin in Staten Island.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.220
Whoa.

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.220
I wasn't living there.

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:55.220
It was a Manhattan situation at the time.

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.220
But I really did hear Dan and Spencer

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:03.220
and Jeff and Schrab and Brandon

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.220
and Mike Eagle later on.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.220
But back then, Mike Eagle wasn't there yet.

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:09.220
It's true.

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:12.220
You could hear something very special

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:15.220
whenever you put this on your ear holes.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.220
And you could count on a certain amount

01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:21.220
of brotherhood, honesty, love, friendship

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:24.220
that you guys were gracious, brave,

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:27.220
and fucking bold enough to put on display.

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:30.220
Yay.

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:35.220
I would suggest that a lot of us came to know you guys

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.220
as strange brothers and friends.

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.220
And I would like to say that in the dark times

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:43.220
we have all gone through.

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:47.220
You guys did a real public and universal and cosmic service

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.220
by putting out this wonderful life raft

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.220
that you could see how bright it was

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.220
with your eyes closed, listening real hard.

01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:55.220
So thank you for that.

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.220
Thank you, Dave.

01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:59.220
Yeah.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.220
Dave Kline.

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.220
If I can follow up on that.

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.220
I've talked to a lot of people that I've met

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:07.220
at the drawing room or here or around town.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:09.220
A lot of people said that they went through depression

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.220
or some kind of, you know, some mental stuff.

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:15.220
And for some reason, our silly little show

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:17.220
was like really important to people.

01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.220
I've never quite understood that.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.220
But I've talked to so many people that

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.220
that's the reason why they dig it,

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:27.220
they listen to it and they travel all the way out.

01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:29.220
Like clap if you came from way far away.

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:33.220
I know there's people from Italy and Spain

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:36.220
and Australia and England and like all over the map.

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.220
Also, we got Jesse Kemp.

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.220
Jesse, what up, Jesse?

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:41.220
Oh, man. Hey.

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:44.220
Hey, listen, I can't follow that.

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:46.220
That was brilliant.

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:47.220
That was brilliant.

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:50.220
But if I could, since this is still a podcast,

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.220
people can't really see us, can they?

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:54.220
No.

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:55.220
I mean, there's some cameras.

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.220
Of course, I saw a ranked doorbell.

01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.220
There's cameras everywhere.

01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:59.220
There's cameras everywhere.

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:00.220
They're all over.

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.220
This is true.

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.220
But you know what?

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:05.220
I'm going to pass this to my assistant, Arnold,

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:08.220
who's a major Harmontown freak.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.220
Arnold is what got me into this.

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:15.220
And as is Jeff, but Arnold,

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:18.220
can you say a couple of words about Harmontown?

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.220
Give it up for Arnold.

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.220
Arnold.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.220
Oh my God.

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:26.220
Of course, I would say something about Harmontown.

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.220
All more.

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.220
Let me tell you this.

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.220
A couple of things about Dan Harmon.

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:33.220
The man likes slacks.

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:35.220
The man likes shorts.

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:37.220
And the man likes jeans shorts.

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:39.220
And he's very particular about his cut of jeans shorts.

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.220
Let's give it up for Arnold, everybody.

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:43.220
Arnold.

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:46.220
All right.

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.220
All right.

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.220
These intelligent guys.

01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.220
Let's hear them out.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:50.220
Just three more minutes.

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:52.220
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:54.220
Let's hear them out.

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:56.220
I want to tell you guys something really quickly.

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.220
This is Jesse back again.

01:14:58.220 --> 01:14:59.220
Not Arnold.

01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:00.220
Oh, darn.

01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.220
Where's Arnold?

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:02.220
Just in case you could tell,

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.220
even though I second what Arnold was saying

01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.220
about the jeans shorts.

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.220
Dan in the summertime.

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:09.220
I can't tell you how many times I would come to Harmontown here,

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.220
the Dynasty typewriter.

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:13.220
Just to see Dan in his beautiful summer sack

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:15.220
in his summer shorts.

01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:18.220
I've been talking about Dan in jeans shorts.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.220
It's sublime.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.220
I mean, he starts putting them on around May

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.220
and well into September.

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.220
He's still wearing jeans shorts.

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:27.220
I'm going to miss seeing Dan in jeans shorts.

01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.220
But let me just say this really quickly.

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.220
I don't want to take up too much time.

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:34.220
This is like the last cheers.

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:37.220
This is already a million times better

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.220
than the last Seinfeld,

01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:40.220
even though I love Seinfeld.

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.220
But I'm going to say this.

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.220
We're going out with a bang.

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:46.220
You guys, I'm going to tell you the backstage.

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:48.220
We have a musical tribute.

01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.220
Beck is here.

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:51.220
Oh, hell yeah.

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.220
All right.

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:54.220
And if that's not enough,

01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:56.220
we have Willie Nelson here.

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.220
Awesome.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.220
Oh, shit.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.220
Also, Woody Harold and Matthew McConaughey.

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.220
MC Arnold is going to be in the house.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.220
MC Arnold.

01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:05.220
Oh, I don't know if I could do that.

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:08.220
But you know, I'm Arnold.

01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:10.220
I just, you know, I'm into jeans shorts.

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.220
Sue me.

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:15.220
But listen, I got to tell you this really quickly.

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.220
Two important things.

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.220
And then I'll zip it, but I cannot.

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.220
Now that I hijacked this for a minute,

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:22.220
I can't let you guys out of here

01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:24.220
without knowing about an amazing project

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:27.220
that Dan is launching in March.

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.220
Dan has his very own wine.

01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:32.220
It's a rosé coming out.

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:38.220
It's called Dan Harmon's third testicle.

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.220
Now, this is a wine like no other wine.

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:45.220
And let me tell you that up in Dan's Napa vineyard,

01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:48.220
basically there was a mishap with the grape crusher

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:53.220
and some testosterone got mixed in with the wine, so to speak.

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.220
Jesse, hang on.

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.220
Speaking of wine, Ricardo, you hear where you at, baby?

01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:57.220
Ricardo!

01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.220
Ricardo, you brought wine from your hometown

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.220
outside of Florence, Italy, right?

01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.220
Can you bring it up?

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:05.220
It's in the grid roll because they come and have it here.

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.220
Okay.

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.220
Ricardo, please come on stage,

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:13.220
because when he gets up here,

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:17.220
give it up for young Italian Steve Kugen.

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:19.220
Steve Kugen!

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:23.220
He looks way too much like Steve Kugen.

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:25.220
What's up, Ricardo?

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.220
Welcome.

01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:27.220
What's happening?

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:29.220
Here's the wine.

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:30.220
Look at this.

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:34.220
Okay, so this is like for all of you,

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:35.220
but Jeff called dips on it, so...

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.220
Yeah, it's fine.

01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:37.220
I think it's just gonna be nice.

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.220
I'm gonna take it.

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.220
I don't know if it's the best one,

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.220
but it's from my hometown.

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.220
Italy?

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.220
The motherfucker looks like Steve Kugen.

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.220
Look at this guy.

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.220
He looks...

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.220
I just saw...

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.220
What's the movie where the...

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:51.220
Tropic Thunder.

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:52.220
Tropic Thunder.

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:53.220
Tropic Thunder.

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:55.220
He looks exactly like Italian Steve Kugen.

01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.220
Sure.

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.220
Are there any...

01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:59.220
Thank you, Ricardo.

01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:00.220
You're welcome.

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:01.220
Piacere.

01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.220
Do we have any...

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.220
Because there's all dudes on stage.

01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.220
Are there any women fans of any like old school...

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.220
What does Arnold have to say about Steve Kugen?

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:12.220
Oh, my God.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.220
I forgot how Arnold talked,

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.220
but I think that he's even more handsome

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.220
than an Italian Steve Kugen.

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.220
But I gotta tell you, I mean,

01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:22.220
this wine looks magnificent,

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.220
and it's got a picture of...

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.220
What would you describe that?

01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:28.220
It looks like a Playboy bunny gone golf.

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:31.220
Playboy bunny gone golf.

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.220
This is amazing wine.

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:35.220
Ricardo is an amazing man,

01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.220
and I'm just gonna zip it

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.220
because everyone on the stage is a legend.

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:40.220
Will Brandon.

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.220
Jeff.

01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:43.220
Rob.

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.220
Of course, Rob.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.220
Dan.

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.220
Dan.

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:47.220
Spencer.

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:49.220
And Richard fucking Branson!

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:50.220
Yeah!

01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:52.220
Right over there.

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.220
Richard shaved for this event,

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:56.220
but fucking no!

01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:58.220
But this is...

01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:00.220
You thank you, Richard Branson, for being here,

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.220
because you reminded me of what I wanted to say.

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.220
Because when I think of Richard Branson,

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.220
I think about Jeff Bezos,

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:08.220
and I'm gonna say this.

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:11.220
Here, I think the reason why on Planet Earth right now,

01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.220
we have so much bad shit,

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:15.220
and I don't even think we would have climate change

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.220
depending on this planet if it weren't for

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.220
tiny penis energy.

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.220
You know what I'm talking about?

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:22.220
Let me say this.

01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.220
If Jeff Bezos had a big dick,

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.220
would he have to own all that money?

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.220
I don't think so.

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.220
You know about...

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.220
Jesse, Jesse, can I interrupt you?

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:32.220
Dan Harmon has always had big dick energy.

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.220
The world needs more big dick energy.

01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:38.220
And I am scared that once this podcast ends,

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.220
that we're gonna not have as much big dick energy.

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.220
Let's give it up for Arnold, everybody. Arnold!

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:44.220
Arnold!

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.220
But final thing out of my mouth,

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:49.220
I have a feeling this is not

01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.220
the last Armored Town ever.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:54.220
Shut your ass up while you still talking.

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:59.220
Please use your lips and just start walking.

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:03.220
Motherfucker, you got to shut your mouth.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.220
No, man.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.220
Keep it going, Mike.

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:13.220
I would keep singing, but I don't want to do

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:15.220
what this motherfucker did.

01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:16.220
No.

01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:19.220
And take up too much time with that bullshit.

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.220
I thought this was just extras

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.220
that this was gonna be edited out.

01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:24.220
No, no, it's all good.

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:26.220
You can't edit their lives.

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.220
Oh, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right,

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:32.220
you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right,

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.220
you're right.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.220
But no, no, Mike, Mike, let's do a song.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.220
And that is why Dan Harmon is Dan Harmon.

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:39.220
Jesse.

01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.220
I'm sipping it.

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:42.220
You gave him a mic.

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:44.220
What did you think was gonna happen?

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.220
He's doing everything that's all good.

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.220
Even the microphone.

01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:49.220
Will you stop talking until that?

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.220
You know, when this show started,

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:55.220
I didn't think it would last seven weeks, you know?

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.220
Look at us now.

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:04.220
Do you remember what the very first Armentone,

01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.220
like what you talked about, did you ever,

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.220
when was the last time you listened to the very first Armentone?

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:10.220
Well, I haven't.

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:14.220
It was the promise of going to the moon, wasn't it?

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:18.220
But it started as, we weren't podcasting right away.

01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:21.220
And in my memory, although we tend to conflate these things,

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:24.220
but I believe it was like, we were doing it strictly live,

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:27.220
and we were recording them just in case,

01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:32.220
and kind of off and on, the recording was working and stuff.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:36.220
And it was the Chevy Chase thing that kind of like,

01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:40.220
it was a tipping point because that was a live show

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:43.220
that was not to be, that was not a podcast.

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.220
So we were doing the show for a while.

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:48.220
I think that's what Jeff referenced, it was monthly.

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:51.220
It was like, you know, I still had that old school,

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:55.220
like LA kind of perception of like,

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.220
oh, there's all these shows in LA,

01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:00.220
where you can go see Harry Dean Stanton playing trombone

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:03.220
or Jeff Goldblum like, fuck a duck or something,

01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:05.220
and it's not part of their real lives.

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.220
It's a good show.

01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:08.220
It doesn't end up in T.M.P.

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.220
Nobody played the bone like Harry Dean.

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:12.220
But then I made the awful judgment,

01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:15.220
the horrible judgment mistake of playing Chevy's voicemail

01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:17.220
into the microphone, and somebody was recording it,

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:19.220
and that was part of the decision to be like,

01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:21.220
okay, let's just start podcasting,

01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:23.220
because if anything, that'll be a shield,

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:28.220
because if you want things to be out there,

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:31.220
then people start to ignore it more.

01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:35.220
It was like, well, there's 5,000 hours of this guy.

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:41.220
Get that on the mic, yeah.

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:42.220
There you go.

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.220
It all ended.

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:49.220
I was so excited watching Adam Goldberg's face

01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.220
during Jesse Camp talking,

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:54.220
because Adam was like, I fucking did it.

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:58.220
I finished first.

01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:00.220
Yeah, I can't remember what the question was,

01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:02.220
but it was like, yeah, there was a...

01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:04.220
I don't remember what the first, it was the whole moon thing.

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.220
It was just the idea of alienation,

01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:09.220
and nobody told me to tie my shoes and all that stuff,

01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.220
which is like, you know, that's the thing.

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.220
It's like, I don't really feel that way anymore.

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.220
I'm not like, hey, leave me alone.

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:18.220
Don't tell me what to do.

01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:19.220
I'm right about everything.

01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:21.220
Everyone else is wrong kind of guy anymore,

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:25.220
and that's become an actual point of view

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.220
that you can't even really defend

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.220
even when you do feel that way.

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:31.220
It's not charismatic anymore.

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:33.220
And I don't always feel that way,

01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:36.220
but sometimes I do, and it's just sort of like,

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:39.220
I don't want to talk in circles,

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.220
but that's part of the thing is sort of like,

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:42.220
who the fuck am I?

01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:43.220
It used to be very simple.

01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:46.220
It was like, I'm a baby, you know?

01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:51.220
I just want to kind of whine and say,

01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.220
what about me?

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:55.220
And it was therapeutic for me.

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:59.220
So that was the answer to your question.

01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:01.220
When, you know, they always say,

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.220
if you keep a journal, don't go back and read your journal.

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.220
When do you think you'll go back

01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:06.220
and listen to some of these episodes?

01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:07.220
I don't know.

01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:10.220
I don't know if I ever would, because like,

01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:12.220
I don't know.

01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:15.220
If Chris McKenna and I get way drunk enough,

01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:17.220
we'll like, maybe we'll like,

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:21.220
we'll start watching community episodes.

01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:24.220
And we'll get like halfway through the D&D one,

01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:26.220
and then we'll pass out.

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:29.220
But it's like, there's something about revisiting stuff

01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:32.220
that's like too, like, I don't know.

01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:34.220
Because it's like, but you know, it's like,

01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:36.220
like, you need to, like...

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:42.220
It's funny that you're holding the wine bottle.

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:44.220
What?

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.220
Drinking wine.

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:49.220
What? Why no Del Ricardo?

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.220
Oh, no.

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:51.220
That's not even a, that's like,

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:54.220
he's not even really Italian, is he?

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:57.220
Why no Del Ricardo?

01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:58.220
That's Spanish.

01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.220
All right.

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:01.220
That's just, that's not what it says.

01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:03.220
This labels in Korean.

01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:05.220
When did you like, feel like,

01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:07.220
with Harmontown, did you like, go,

01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:09.220
yes, that was it.

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:11.220
That's the, this is the...

01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:14.220
Delicious, and I love the Tilda Swinton on the label.

01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:17.220
It does feel like a Tilda Swinton.

01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:19.220
Sorry, Rob.

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.220
When you were, I mean, like it started off with this thing

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:24.220
about we're going to colonize the moon and whatever,

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:27.220
but then eventually I feel like you hit like,

01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:32.220
a stride of, this is what a typical Harmontown is,

01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:36.220
was it when you were at Meltdown,

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:38.220
was it at the castle, was it here,

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:42.220
when did you feel like, oh, okay, this is working,

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:43.220
this is the pattern?

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:45.220
I don't know, I never really felt that way.

01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.220
I don't know, I guess early on at Meltdown

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:50.220
I felt like there was a groovy thing going

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:53.220
that kind of made a little bit of sense.

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:56.220
And I think that after Meltdown closed,

01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:59.220
a lot of us in the comedy community,

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:02.220
lame thing, comedy community,

01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:06.220
but a lot of LA comedy people that had performed at Meltdown

01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:09.220
all of a sudden realized as one does,

01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:15.220
that how much of the show was that venue.

01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:20.220
That Harmontown was kind of sort of inextricably defined

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:24.220
by the wooden pillars in the room and this,

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:27.220
and back in those days I was always like,

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.220
God damn it, if we could just get rid of these pillars

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:31.220
and make this room five times bigger,

01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.220
we could put cameras everywhere,

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.220
and then I could show slides of my dog,

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.220
always like driven by this thing.

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:41.220
There was never a full embrace of the podcast of it all.

01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:44.220
It was just a show that became a podcast.

01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:47.220
And then the other funny transformation that happened

01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:50.220
is it's so weird to remember this because I can't,

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.220
it's sort of like the way I remember sometimes

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:54.220
I smoked a pack and a half a day,

01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.220
and then I'm like, because someone will say,

01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.220
do you mind if I smoke in here?

01:26:58.220 --> 01:26:59.220
And I'll be like, yeah, I don't care.

01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:02.220
And I'm like, holy shit, I smoked like a chimney.

01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:05.220
I can't believe this, but like originally

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.220
when we were recording the episodes,

01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:11.220
I would sit with Feral Audio founder Dustin Marshall

01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:13.220
and we would like, I would go over to his house,

01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:16.220
I would book sessions that would last like three or four hours

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:18.220
where we'd go through the entire recording

01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:23.220
and edit the ums and us out, basically.

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:25.220
Like I was like, oh, no one wants to listen to somebody

01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:28.220
like Stammer and Stutter and say the same thing

01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.220
over and over again.

01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:30.220
When did you stop doing that?

01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:33.220
I don't remember, we just got exhausted.

01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:34.220
So I remember, yeah, you do it.

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:37.220
And I can totally relate because I would be like,

01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.220
I would want to do that too.

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.220
It wasn't like you let go.

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:44.220
I assure you, that's so strange to think about

01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.220
because I'm the laziest guy in the world

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:48.220
and also the most narcissistic.

01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:52.220
I'd be like, yeah, listen to me, figure it out, whatever.

01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:57.220
But at the time, it was like, oh, that's what you're supposed to do.

01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:59.220
You recorded it live, it's sloppy,

01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:01.220
clean it up, or don't put it in people's ears,

01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:04.220
you terrible person, be responsible.

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:07.220
And I'm sure there was just this point where it was like,

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:09.220
well, if I have to keep doing that,

01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:12.220
then I have to stop doing the show because it's too much work.

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:16.220
It's like the amount of time I need to spend on actual shit.

01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:19.220
But it's just so funny that I would go through the show

01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:22.220
and go like, oh, I'm being kind of redundant there.

01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:23.220
Yeah.

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:25.220
Look, what was the goal?

01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:27.220
It's such a weird...

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:29.220
It's crazy to look back,

01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:32.220
because we just do this kind of silly thing,

01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.220
we just come here, we don't talk about it.

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.220
The first few episodes, I think, Dan,

01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:39.220
you and I, we'd have kind of a plan,

01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:41.220
like a trajectory that we're going to do,

01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:43.220
and then we gave that up pretty quickly.

01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:46.220
But then Robin Williams was on the show.

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:49.220
And we wrote a song with Eric Idle,

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:52.220
and he sang it, like some pretty crazy stuff has happened.

01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:56.220
And it really has just been this lazy thing,

01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:59.220
but it makes me very happy

01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:03.220
and kind of confused that everybody likes it so much.

01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:06.220
I really want to thank everybody who's listening

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.220
or who's here tonight, who traveled.

01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:11.220
It's pretty crazy.

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:14.220
It's kind of emotional that you guys all dug it so much.

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:17.220
I can definitely explain the...

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:29.220
I definitely understand as a podcast listener,

01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:32.220
but it's kind of worth noting that the word podcast

01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.220
is something that in eight years, it's like a new word,

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:37.220
and that at the beginning of these eight years,

01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:39.220
this decade that we've just been through,

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:42.220
I remember being in Erin McGathy's car

01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:47.220
and her iPod playing.

01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:50.220
This guy started talking about how he and Natasha

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:52.220
had just broken up,

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:56.220
but the podcast was going to continue to be what it was,

01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:58.220
and, hey, breakups just happened, man.

01:29:58.220 --> 01:29:59.220
That's all.

01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:01.220
It's just, look, man, things just happened.

01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:03.220
And I'm like, after like 10 minutes

01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:05.220
of just listening to this guy talk,

01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:08.220
I was like, what the fuck is this?

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:10.220
It's not a book on tape or radio.

01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:12.220
So what is this?

01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:14.220
And she's like, oh, it's Duncan Trussell.

01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:18.220
And he had just broken up with Natasha Ligiero.

01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:20.220
They were doing a podcast together for a while,

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:25.220
and then he was explaining what was really going on

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:28.220
in his life, which he would later do

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:31.220
as he got diagnosed with cancer, as his mother died.

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:34.220
And Duncan was also, I believe, the first podcast

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:37.220
I was ever on as a guest.

01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:41.220
And I really want to give him a big, big shout out,

01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:43.220
because...

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:47.220
Also, while you're on that, Dan,

01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:51.220
Emily Gordon, she's the one that made this happen.

01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:53.220
Emily needs to be...

01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:59.220
She told Dan to have a podcast at Nerd Mountain Meltdown.

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.220
That's why this all started.

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:02.220
Yeah.

01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:06.220
But also like Adam Goldberg and Anatoly and Dave Kline

01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:10.220
and Vega and all the people that we've met

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:13.220
that have come up throughout the years.

01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:16.220
And also, I would never have met Spencer Crittenden

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:18.220
without this show.

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:19.220
Yeah.

01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:22.220
Thank you to me.

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:25.220
And Chris and Sarah.

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:27.220
Chris and Sarah.

01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.220
I'm going to forget a million names of people

01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:32.220
that we've just kind of pulled out of the crowd

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.220
back in the days when we just say,

01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:36.220
like, anybody want to come up and talk?

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:41.220
And we've met a lot of beautiful, wonderful people.

01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:43.220
I'm going to get sad.

01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:45.220
Uh...

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:49.220
Before you get sad,

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:53.220
I'm just going to shout out a couple people.

01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:54.220
Oh, shit.

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:58.220
Not your comedically long list of weird names.

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:00.220
Arnold.

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:05.220
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:08.220
Shout out to Splendid Docs.

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:11.220
Mr. Johnny Dangerously.

01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:12.220
Oh, yeah.

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.220
Sinister Silence.

01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:16.220
Devon Cook.

01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:18.220
Joanna Curtis.

01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.220
Hill Prozac.

01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:20.220
Jeremy Myers.

01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:21.220
Paul Nolan.

01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:22.220
Heather Hooks.

01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:24.220
God bless you all.

01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.220
Hey, Paul, you got a whip on you right now?

01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:28.220
Thank you so much for your support.

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:30.220
The show's not over yet, but Paul,

01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:33.220
we got a headroom for you to do some whips for us.

01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:35.220
Paul, the whip guy.

01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:36.220
Yeah.

01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:39.220
Y'all need to tell me about this shit, too.

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.220
Whips.

01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.220
And if you want to whip, get one.

01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:42.220
What?

01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:44.220
I've not been adequately warned about any of this shit.

01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:47.220
I'm about to step back four to six feet

01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:50.220
and let's all have all the whip fun y'all want to have.

01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:51.220
Yeah.

01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.220
Why are we...

01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:53.220
You're safe, Mike. You're safe.

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:54.220
Uh-uh, I'll be watching.

01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:55.220
Watch me.

01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:56.220
I ain't with none of this shit.

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.220
Audience.

01:32:58.220 --> 01:32:59.220
I forgot about it.

01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:01.220
He's got a cigarette.

01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:02.220
Yeah, do it.

01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:03.220
Wait, oh.

01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:05.220
It's a whip.

01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:07.220
It's a whip.

01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.220
He's got a cigarette out?

01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:09.220
He's got a cigarette out.

01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:10.220
It's a whip.

01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:11.220
What?

01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:12.220
He whipped it.

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:13.220
What?

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.220
Cut the cigarette in half.

01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:15.220
That's how you quit smoking.

01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.220
You learn how to whip.

01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:17.220
Whip it.

01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:18.220
What up, Paul?

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:19.220
There he goes.

01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.220
California's fucking dangerous.

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:21.220
Yeah.

01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:24.220
They got tall people.

01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:25.220
Yeah.

01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:27.220
Mike, I forget.

01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:28.220
What was the connection?

01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:29.220
You met Dan Ware.

01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:31.220
What was the intro with you?

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:33.220
We did Scott Rogowski's show together.

01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:34.220
That's right.

01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:35.220
Yeah, he had his live show.

01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:40.220
He used to do the trivia HQ on Apple every day.

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:41.220
Right.

01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:46.220
But he had a show called Running Late, and I was doing music shit on there, and he had

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:49.220
Dan on it as a guest, and that's when we met.

01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:51.220
Don't we have tapes?

01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:55.220
Church, you got there?

01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:57.220
We got the tapes that you guys did together, right?

01:33:57.220 --> 01:34:03.220
Yeah, I produced a rap album by Dan, and there's tapes of it in the back.

01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:05.220
Also, let's give it up for Church.

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:12.220
He's been in all the social media and production.

01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:18.220
And let's give it up also to Brendan, to Brendan, Church and Brendan are the two that make all

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:20.220
the commercials funny.

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:24.220
And Brendan does all the music, and Church is the one that makes it all happen.

01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:25.220
So give it up for them.

01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:29.220
If you like the ads, it's Brendan and the Church.

01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:35.220
And Nolan Fabricius, who got all my friends in, and it's been running this shit.

01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:39.220
And Zac McKeever up there making the fucking beats happen and doing everything.

01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:44.220
Yeah.

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:49.220
And also the people that I don't really know their names, but all the people that did the

01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:52.220
rap writer, like you guys have been, what a cool venue this has been.

01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:54.220
Shout out to Sarah Hill.

01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:56.220
Sarah Hill, hell yeah.

01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:58.220
Shout out to Kris Boruff.

01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.220
Kris Boruff.

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:00.220
Kevin Day.

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:01.220
Yes.

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.220
Yes, Kevin Day.

01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:03.220
Yes.

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:06.220
Everybody, if I'm forgetting anybody, forgive me, but who?

01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:07.220
Steve Levy.

01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:08.220
Steve Levy.

01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:09.220
The man.

01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:11.220
Can we bring Steve Levy on stage?

01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:13.220
Steve Levy, get the fuck out here.

01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.220
Yeah.

01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:15.220
Steve Levy.

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:16.220
Hey.

01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.220
Steve Levy.

01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:19.220
Steve Levy.

01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:21.220
Steve Levy.

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:23.220
Steve Levy.

01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:25.220
What up, Levy?

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:27.220
How you doing, baby?

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:29.220
I'm doing good.

01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:33.220
You've been going through some kind of some rough shit, right?

01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:35.220
Or should we not talk about that?

01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:37.220
You brought it up our way to end the show, right?

01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:39.220
I don't know, Jeff.

01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:44.220
Weren't you saying backstage that you had some great news you wanted to share with everybody?

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:50.220
Just some heartwarming pregnant.

01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:51.220
No.

01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.220
What?

01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:53.220
You don't have great news.

01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:54.220
He was lying that you.

01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:55.220
I was just lying.

01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:58.220
I was just making an ass out of myself in front of my closest friends.

01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:01.220
Hey, Levy, what do you like top?

01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:07.220
You got a couple top moments like top three, top two, top one.

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:09.220
That I've witnessed.

01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:11.220
Or that you haven't.

01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:13.220
Yeah, yeah.

01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:17.220
Oh, Dan peeing live on stage.

01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:19.220
Into a diaper.

01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:21.220
Into a diaper in San Francisco.

01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:24.220
Dan Ward depends and peed into his depends.

01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:30.220
It was like 40 minutes before the show and Dan decided, what if I pissed live on stage?

01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:31.220
Well, that's come on.

01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:32.220
That's not how my thought process was.

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:34.220
I believe that's exactly what happened.

01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:38.220
There was a shit story earlier with another person you admire.

01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:39.220
We're at exactly.

01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:41.220
I always approach it with a new one.

01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.220
You peed and you were so happy about it, you were really stoked.

01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:46.220
You're like, oh shit, I can just pee wherever I go now.

01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:52.220
It started as this because somebody had mentioned the people in Times Square when they wear diapers for years.

01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:54.220
And I was like, come on.

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.220
That's just peeing in your pants.

01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:59.220
I was like, I want to know what these diapers are like.

01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:00.220
Yeah, we're in Pesuvio, right?

01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:01.220
Incredible.

01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:03.220
You're peeing into a portal.

01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:06.220
It's a whole ass mood.

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:15.220
So I had to run and find a place that had the nicest, best looking adult diapers for Dan to wear on stage.

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:18.220
Not because I insisted on anything other than adult diapers.

01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:22.220
Apparently you just want me to look good while I'm peeing myself.

01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:23.220
No, no.

01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:26.220
You don't want the 8K diaper, which is lame.

01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:28.220
But you peed and the look.

01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:31.220
8K, I was like 8K diaper.

01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:33.220
Oh, 8K.

01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:38.220
The look on your face while you're peeing, you were so happy.

01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:43.220
You look so completely like, oh, I can just pee in front of people.

01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:50.220
Baby boomers are the first modern generation to get that age where they need diapers.

01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:57.220
And so of course the diapers are now, they look like, and the technology behind them.

01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:06.220
So we have them to thank for our nation's opioid addiction and the pills and the diapers are fucking NASA level.

01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:13.220
Because the people that invented the Beatles are shitting themselves and are in fucking pain.

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.220
I can't wait to get old.

01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:17.220
Durr.

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:19.220
I can't wait to piss just like hanging out.

01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:21.220
How was it pissing on your pants?

01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:22.220
It was incredible.

01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:23.220
Was it?

01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:28.220
Yes, because think about everything you do when you pee.

01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:30.220
Men are always kind of like...

01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:31.220
Cry?

01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:33.220
We kind of like...

01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:37.220
You know, we flaunt with women.

01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:40.220
It's like, oh, we're just like...

01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.220
It's no problem. You just whip it out.

01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:45.220
I'm out of the bus driver again.

01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:47.220
You whip it out.

01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:54.220
They just like whatever and they got a squat and it's more of an ordeal for them to pee into a bush or whatever.

01:38:54.220 --> 01:39:02.220
You have no idea how high maintenance what we have to do is until you experience just standing in your pants

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:05.220
and doing whatever you want.

01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:07.220
You can play a video game.

01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:09.220
You can talk to people and just pee.

01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:11.220
Have you ever worn these ever again?

01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:12.220
No.

01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.220
You don't have to.

01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.220
I left the stage a second ago to pee. I do wish I could have stayed.

01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:20.220
It's truly like...

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:23.220
We've all peed in the shower so you have this experience of like there's water all over you.

01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:25.220
I have never peed in the shower.

01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:27.220
Whoa.

01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:29.220
Sorry.

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:31.220
We're telling truths up here.

01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:34.220
This from the guy who doesn't like...

01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:36.220
You've never peed in the shower?

01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:37.220
I've never peed in the shower.

01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:38.220
Because you're a gentleman?

01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:41.220
Because the toilet's right there.

01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:44.220
But peeing in the shower is like...

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:45.220
From the shower?

01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:46.220
That's your birthright.

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:52.220
There's never been a time, I guess, when I didn't realize I had to pee until I was in the middle of the shower.

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:55.220
But don't you get in the shower and you've got the warm water rolling over you?

01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:57.220
That doesn't make me have to pee.

01:39:57.220 --> 01:39:59.220
It makes me have to pee.

01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:00.220
Okay, well that's just me then.

01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:02.220
Do women pee in the shower?

01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:04.220
Yes.

01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:06.220
That was nearly unanimous.

01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:11.220
I think they kind of live for it, honestly, which is why men are usually not afraid to admit it

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:14.220
because we've never been shamed by women for peeing in the shower.

01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:18.220
Because women are like the Christopher Columbus of peeing in the shower.

01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:21.220
Women buy either...

01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:23.220
Because it's dark out there, buy applause.

01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:26.220
What women has never peed in the shower?

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:29.220
Yeah, give it up a few.

01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:31.220
Now, can I ask one of you why?

01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:35.220
Just because you never had to or you think it's rude?

01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:37.220
It's dirty.

01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:39.220
But you're in the shower?

01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:41.220
I think it's gross.

01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:43.220
It's probably going to be the answer.

01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:46.220
I don't think people that have never peed in the shower are monsters.

01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:47.220
I don't.

01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:49.220
No, no, I'm just saying.

01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:50.220
I'm not even against it.

01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:52.220
I just think they never did it.

01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:54.220
You should try it sometime.

01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.220
Maybe tomorrow. Who knows?

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:59.220
The night is young, baby.

01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.220
Hey, everybody.

01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:03.220
Uh-oh.

01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:05.220
Throw a beat down, Zach.

01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:07.220
Throw a beat down, Zach.

01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:09.220
It's a peon song.

01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:11.220
Put a beat on before you get peed on.

01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:14.220
Okay, well, it's me, MC Gun Control.

01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.220
Oh, shit.

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:18.220
Oh, damn.

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:19.220
MC.

01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:21.220
Give it up for MC Gun Control.

01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:25.220
I can't believe we're here at the final episode of Harmontown.

01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:30.220
A platform I have used to spread my ambiguous message

01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:33.220
about gun violence.

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:36.220
My name, as you know, is MC Gun Control,

01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:43.220
and the bit is you can't tell if I'm for or against it.

01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:46.220
But there's also a part of an added meta bit

01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:50.220
about how forthright I am about that being my bit,

01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:54.220
which I personally enjoy.

01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:58.220
But here's a little rap about gun control,

01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:01.220
which is also my name.

01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:10.220
The AK-47 is capable of killing 30,000 lives a second.

01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:17.220
It's the most devastating weapon ever available in stores.

01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:19.220
Yeah!

01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:25.220
Over 50 million handguns are in the houses.

01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:28.220
They're very, very popular.

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:30.220
Handguns are popular.

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.220
The most popular.

01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:35.220
Even more than blenders.

01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:39.220
I'm MC Gun Control.

01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:46.220
Bullets are lethal.

01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:49.220
Bullets are lethal.

01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:53.220
More lethal than icicles.

01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:58.220
Even if they don't go through your eyeballs,

01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:02.220
which icicles have to do to be lethal.

01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:06.220
If you throw an icicle at a human,

01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:08.220
they'll get mad at you.

01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:10.220
They'll know what you are.

01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:17.220
They'll know you are far into the realm of enmity.

01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.220
With them, they'll be like,

01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:23.220
hey, why'd you throw an icicle at me?

01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:27.220
They'll also probably think you'd just throw an icicle at them,

01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:32.220
because the icicle will have broken up in the air.

01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:36.220
By the time it hits them, it'll be cubes.

01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:41.220
They'll think you'd just throw an icicle at them in winter.

01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:44.220
Guns, on the other hand,

01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:51.220
can kill people regardless of the season or the intention.

01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:53.220
MC Gun Control.

01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:55.220
Yes, thank you.

01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:56.220
I'm MC Gun Control.

01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:59.220
You know MC Gun Control.

01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:04.220
Did you know guns are responsible for more deaths than cancer, Jeff?

01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.220
I didn't know that.

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:06.220
Mike, you got to be...

01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:07.220
You're looking at your thing.

01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:09.220
That was his beat.

01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:10.220
That was yours.

01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:12.220
Everything was all my fault, basically.

01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:15.220
Let's do one more, then.

01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:17.220
Oh, shit.

01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:23.220
Hey, I'm MC N209.

01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:26.220
And I'm not feeling fine.

01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:29.220
You got 10 seconds to comply.

01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:31.220
With my rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm.

01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:32.220
10.

01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.220
Yo, it's old Detroit.

01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:36.220
It's got a cancer called crime.

01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.220
That ain't no joint.

01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.220
Sick.

01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:41.220
Yo, I'm the next step in law enforcement.

01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:44.220
Put your mother so hard, her pussy is engorgent.

01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:45.220
Two.

01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:50.220
One.

01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:57.220
Sometimes I speak like I should experience after to make a word rhyme.

01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:04.220
Her pussy was engorgent.

01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:06.220
Rower.

01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:09.220
I can't walk downstairs.

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.220
I roar like a lion.

01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:14.220
I'm stopped motion animated, but I ain't crying.

01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:16.220
You can't see genie.

01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:20.220
That won't be reality because you need the texture to make you feel humanity.

01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:23.220
Coming through the animation, giving it character.

01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:30.220
Fuck your mama so hard, I needed an airplane hanger to hold all the chairs.

01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:32.220
Cause that's how fucking is.

01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:35.220
When you're in 209, you do that shit right.

01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:38.220
You never leave a single pussy hanging tight.

01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:39.220
You lose it.

01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:40.220
Okay.

01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:41.220
You lose it.

01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:42.220
Okay.

01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:43.220
There it is.

01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:44.220
Yeah.

01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:48.220
Wow.

01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:53.220
We really heard from all of the old beloved characters.

01:45:53.220 --> 01:46:00.220
If I was a reporter from Vulture doing a retrospective on our podcast, I would be extra impressed at this point.

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:05.220
And I'm sure that article is going to turn out great.

01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:08.220
But did I mention this already?

01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.220
Paste magazine, I think it was.

01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:13.220
Why do they still call them magazines?

01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:18.220
They said we were, you know, one of the best podcasts of the decade.

01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:22.220
I think you're kind of cheating when your podcast lasts a decade.

01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:25.220
I mean, it's like a weird thing for a podcast to be so old.

01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:26.220
So we were in there.

01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:28.220
What are we up there with?

01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:30.220
What are we up there with?

01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:31.220
I didn't read the article.

01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:33.220
Probably Splendid Table.

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.220
I think number one was...

01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:37.220
I'm going to read the Vulture one, though.

01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:39.220
This American Life is number one, I think.

01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:40.220
Fuck that.

01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.220
Well, whatever.

01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:46.220
You know, that's because I had an episode on there.

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:47.220
Wow.

01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:48.220
Goddamn it.

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.220
Way to make it about you.

01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:51.220
Way to make it about you.

01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:52.220
Christ.

01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:53.220
Dan, what's next for you?

01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:55.220
I always knew I'd end up on this American Life.

01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:57.220
Do you want to do another podcast ever again, Dan?

01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:58.220
Is this it for you?

01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:01.220
Are you just going to fuck off straight and do the night?

01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:06.220
No, I think that, honestly, it's not a fun answer,

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:10.220
but no, I can't wait to do more stuff.

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:16.220
I just think that I'm just tired of acting like I'm a product.

01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:22.220
So I think that that was a fun surfing style for a while,

01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:25.220
and it doesn't make as much sense anymore.

01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:28.220
And everybody matures at different rates,

01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:31.220
and it's like a bingo card, like you knock out shit

01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:32.220
at different times.

01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:35.220
Some people are prodigies at shit, and then absolute morons

01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:37.220
and other stuff until they're 70.

01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:42.220
I've never done actual just like, hey, I think I'm going to try to be funny

01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:46.220
and do a performance and try to make people laugh kind of thing.

01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:50.220
I've always fallen back on the, hey, look at who I am.

01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.220
A lot of great people have done that.

01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:57.220
Howard Stern and the like, we love that.

01:47:57.220 --> 01:48:01.220
It's a heavy tradition of like, that's the old white guy going like,

01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.220
hey, look at me, I'm sucking my thumb.

01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:08.220
But I'm bored with that and feel like also,

01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:11.220
I would have to double down so much.

01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:12.220
I have a question.

01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:15.220
Can somebody run for mayor of Harmontown?

01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:17.220
Can somebody run for mayor of Harmontown?

01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:18.220
A special election?

01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.220
Oh, shit.

01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:25.220
I declare my candidacy a fucking Harmontown.

01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:28.220
Yes.

01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:31.220
My first act is mayor of Harmontown to change the name.

01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:33.220
I second that emotion.

01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:37.220
What if, yeah, what if I can just, Mike Eagle just becomes mayor of Harmontown.

01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:39.220
Eagletown.

01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:41.220
Schrab.

01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:43.220
Schrab.

01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:46.220
I can make some shit about me for seven years.

01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:51.220
As this town's Obama, I obviously cannot make an endorsement at this stage.

01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:53.220
It would be catastrophic.

01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:57.220
This town's Obama.

01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:00.220
Give me a beat.

01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:03.220
This town's Obama.

01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:04.220
Okay.

01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:05.220
Go do it.

01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.220
This town's Obama.

01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:12.220
Never gonna fuck a mama.

01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:14.220
Yo, every town's got a zone Obama.

01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:16.220
Obama.

01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:17.220
Chicago.

01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:18.220
Obama.

01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:19.220
Obama.

01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.220
Yeah.

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.220
New Orleans.

01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:23.220
Obama.

01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:25.220
Not Obama.

01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:27.220
No.

01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:28.220
Obama.

01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.220
We can go out and out.

01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:33.220
Just listen to cities.

01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:39.220
It either is or it isn't Obama.

01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:41.220
Cutta hay, Wisconsin.

01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:42.220
Not Obama.

01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:45.220
It's a different Obama.

01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:48.220
Every town's got an Obama, y'all.

01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:49.220
It's not the same.

01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:52.220
Like my sweaters made of lava, yo.

01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:53.220
Yo.

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:56.220
I made my sentences with commas, so.

01:49:56.220 --> 01:49:59.220
Obama.

01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:02.220
Obama.

01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:05.220
Everybody gotta be their own Obama.

01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:08.220
Be yourself's own Obama.

01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:12.220
Hope and change on the open range.

01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:14.220
Fuck your mama so hard.

01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:17.220
Her labia hang.

01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:19.220
Come on, I gotta stop.

01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:21.220
Mike, I'm so sorry.

01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:22.220
No, I know.

01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:23.220
Look, look.

01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:25.220
Hey, hey.

01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:27.220
I was playing along earlier, right?

01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:29.220
But I heard the reports.

01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:31.220
I heard what happened after.

01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:33.220
I know what happened.

01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:36.220
And also we recorded a whole album together.

01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:40.220
We had to make the whole album about fucking mamas.

01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:41.220
It is a tic.

01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:43.220
It's a rap tic.

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:47.220
And it's like, isn't it weird how you would, it's like,

01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:52.220
it's not a rap tic that saves you in really any way.

01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:55.220
It saves you, though, because you use it.

01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:56.220
You know all these rhymes.

01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:59.220
Well, it's like you, yeah, it's sort of like,

01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:02.220
it's a tic during the setup of a rhyme, though.

01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:04.220
Or, no, I guess it's not, actually.

01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:06.220
It's okay, it's in the, because you go like,

01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:08.220
oh, I went to the store and I bought some milk.

01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:11.220
Then you can go, fuck your mama so hard,

01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:13.220
because, well, you're thinking of the word silk.

01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:14.220
Yes.

01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:15.220
But then you say the silk,

01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:17.220
and then you start rhyming about the silk.

01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:18.220
Right.

01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:21.220
So you actually use it, which makes it usable.

01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:23.220
We might have talked about this before,

01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:26.220
but when you're writing, are you just freestyling

01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:28.220
and putting it on pen and paper?

01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:30.220
No, I'm writing.

01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:31.220
So it's all written.

01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:33.220
I'm making choices.

01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:35.220
Yeah.

01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:39.220
But the writing process, you're still,

01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:41.220
like, obviously, while you're making stuff up

01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:43.220
and putting it on the paper, like, you're still,

01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:46.220
there's a freestyle, you're selecting choices

01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:49.220
out of the freestyles that are coming out of your head.

01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:50.220
Sure.

01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:51.220
Yeah.

01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:52.220
But then you make the choices and you go,

01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:53.220
okay, that's the one I'm using.

01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:55.220
Like, this is the best option.

01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:56.220
Right.

01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:57.220
I'll write that one down.

01:51:57.220 --> 01:51:58.220
Yeah.

01:51:58.220 --> 01:51:59.220
That's an interesting idea.

01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:01.220
You make a choice and you go,

01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:03.220
I'm going to make the best choice.

01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:04.220
A good one.

01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:05.220
Yeah, do the good thing.

01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:07.220
You know, like most writers.

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:08.220
Right.

01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:11.220
But somebody about, in England,

01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:14.220
when whose lens anyway was on the air in England,

01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:16.220
a hilarious review said,

01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:19.220
why not prepare something funny?

01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:24.220
Why not improvise?

01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:29.220
I'm going to read something.

01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:30.220
A lot of people, you know,

01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:32.220
we have a history on this show of, like,

01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:35.220
we, you know, people who put themselves out there

01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:38.220
and demand their time around the skillet, you know.

01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:41.220
But I thought this was a,

01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:44.220
this isn't going to blow anyone's mind,

01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:45.220
but I thought it was like,

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:47.220
this is sort of the every man kind of thing.

01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:51.220
I got this, I got handed this note and I won't keep,

01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:53.220
I'll just get through it.

01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:56.220
But that's not something to get through.

01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:58.220
In a way.

01:52:58.220 --> 01:52:59.220
Dear Dan, if you're reading this,

01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:02.220
it means that at some point I was able to intercept you

01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:03.220
and hand this to you.

01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:04.220
That's not true.

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:07.220
I was given to it by a subordinate.

01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:10.220
It's brand done.

01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:13.220
Subordinate.

01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:16.220
Well, there are channels and it got to me.

01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:18.220
And that's the importance of, you know, boundaries.

01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:19.220
Who gave it to you?

01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:21.220
I don't even remember.

01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:22.220
It was me.

01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:23.220
Someone, I, someone I,

01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:27.220
someone I pay someone else to remember their name.

01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:31.220
Keisha, Keisha, who, who was it?

01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:32.220
They handed it to me.

01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:33.220
Steve.

01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:34.220
Keisha.

01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:36.220
Why did your voice overlap with mine?

01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:37.220
Never mind.

01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:38.220
All right.

01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:39.220
Keisha.

01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:40.220
Keisha.

01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:41.220
Yeah.

01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.220
You know what?

01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:43.220
Yeah.

01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:44.220
You're welcome.

01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:45.220
You're welcome.

01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:46.220
No, I know.

01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:47.220
I don't accept.

01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:51.220
My diversity program can't be fictional.

01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:53.220
It doesn't help.

01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:54.220
If Demorge was here,

01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:58.220
the three of us would have whooped your way.

01:53:58.220 --> 01:53:59.220
Such a stereo.

01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:00.220
Shout out to Demorge.

01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:01.220
Demorge.

01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.220
Demorge.

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:05.220
Does he know the show is ending?

01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:06.220
Yeah.

01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:07.220
He knows.

01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:08.220
Okay.

01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:09.220
Keisha.

01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:10.220
Wow.

01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:11.220
The nerve.

01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:12.220
Yeah.

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:13.220
All right.

01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:14.220
The nerve.

01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:15.220
In which case,

01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:16.220
thank you for taking it and reading it.

01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:17.220
Also,

01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:19.220
thank you for not socially rejecting me when I spoke to you

01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:20.220
briefly at the drawing room,

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:23.220
which would have haunted me forever in parentheses

01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:26.220
and how you so generously and thoroughly answered my

01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:28.220
question about characterization.

01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:30.220
I've got pretty bad social anxiety.

01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:32.220
I feel lonely and ashamed a lot,

01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:34.220
but I'm learning to accept myself better.

01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:36.220
I've got a neurodiverse family.

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:38.220
I'm learning to accept them better too.

01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:41.220
Hearing about your complex relationships with people

01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:43.220
and writing has really helped me.

01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:47.220
Harmontown is so much more than 360 episodes of the best

01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:49.220
podcast ever made.

01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:53.220
I heard someone say no.

01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:55.220
Someone, no.

01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:57.220
It's not more than that.

01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:58.220
That's all it is.

01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:02.220
Listen to American life.

01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:05.220
The day I came across your Story Structure 101 post

01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:07.220
was the day I also discovered Joseph Campbell

01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:08.220
in Harmontown.

01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:10.220
It was also the day I figured out how to end a story.

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:11.220
I was writing,

01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:12.220
which was the first story I got published.

01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:15.220
Now I see this as that Campbellian thing where

01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:17.220
if it's meant to be your adventure,

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:18.220
the world will open.

01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:20.220
I will miss your dialogue on growth,

01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:21.220
truth, and happiness.

01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:24.220
I will miss the podcast like I am losing a very good friend.

01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:25.220
Thank you for everything,

01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:27.220
although I am sure you'll continue to inspire

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:30.220
your moonbound, neurodiverse band of Harmonians

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:32.220
just in different ways.

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:35.220
Kristen, I'll just use her first name.

01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:37.220
Thank you, Kristen.

01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:39.220
That was really good.

01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:42.220
Also, I don't know if it's the same Kristen,

01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:44.220
but another Kristen gave me an awesome gift

01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:46.220
of a bunch of little notebooks like this.

01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:48.220
So thank you, Kristen, for that.

01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:51.220
It better not be like a letter that's identical to that,

01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:53.220
except it's like...

01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:55.220
I don't want to get corny,

01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:57.220
but I really can't say...

01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:59.220
The only thing that I'll take away from this...

01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:01.220
What's it been? Seven, eight years?

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:02.220
How long have we been doing this?

01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:05.220
By the way, I just want to say one thing.

01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:08.220
In 360 episodes,

01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:14.220
I have gotten many, many letters pressed into my hand.

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:16.220
So if you're out there and you're thinking,

01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:18.220
I wrote this motherfucker,

01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:20.220
my dog died, and I don't know...

01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:26.220
I've read 87% to 89% of the letters

01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:29.220
that you've handed me in the back alley

01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.220
or the out front and stuff,

01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:33.220
and they're all always great.

01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:35.220
I read that one.

01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:37.220
It got handed to me tonight.

01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:39.220
That one represents all of your letters.

01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:41.220
I think that's always been so special about it.

01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:43.220
Everybody that knows that we hang out in the drawing room,

01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:45.220
you guys have come out and said hello,

01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:47.220
and usually in a very shy way.

01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:49.220
I have a question about that.

01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:52.220
Y'all tell people on the show

01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:54.220
that y'all hang out at the drawing room?

01:56:54.220 --> 01:56:56.220
We mentioned it, yeah, really.

01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:58.220
In the very beginning.

01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.220
I've seen you there.

01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:02.220
Yeah, but I'm glad to know that now,

01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:05.220
because I won't feel safe there anymore.

01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:08.220
Y'all let everybody know that that's where you hang out.

01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:10.220
It's been so cool throughout the years

01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:12.220
of meeting you all,

01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:14.220
all these faces in the crowd

01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:16.220
and people listening.

01:57:16.220 --> 01:57:18.220
It's been really cool just to...

01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:20.220
I don't know why it means that much to you,

01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:22.220
but it means a lot to me

01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:24.220
that you guys are all so sweet.

01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:26.220
Oh, that's the thing I was going to try.

01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:28.220
It means a lot to you because of...

01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:40.220
That is the most Harmontown thing

01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:42.220
I could have possibly had.

01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:44.220
It means a lot to them because of the time spent.

01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:46.220
That's both the thing.

01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:49.220
There's no way to deflect it because it's just time spent.

01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:51.220
I mean, you...

01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:53.220
That's why when somebody says,

01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:55.220
Holy shit, your podcast means so much,

01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:58.220
that means they've put in the time.

01:57:58.220 --> 01:58:01.220
It's like they've done as much work as we have.

01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:04.220
There are people that only listen to a dozen episodes,

01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:07.220
there's people that have gone and listened to the entire thing

01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:09.220
from the very beginning.

01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:13.220
The fact that Grey Worm from Game of Thrones likes it,

01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:15.220
the fact that Rob Corddry likes it,

01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:17.220
the fact that people that I've met

01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:21.220
that live in Europe and South America and shit,

01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:26.220
the fact that it means something to listen to,

01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:28.220
I guess, neurodiversity

01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:31.220
and our weird ramblings,

01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:33.220
that it's really crazy to me.

01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:36.220
I will say to everybody that listens to this one,

01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:38.220
thank you.

01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:42.220
Yeah.

01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:46.220
Yeah, we got as much out of it as you did, believe me.

01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:49.220
I didn't think we'd last seven weeks.

01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:54.220
I can't believe it.

01:58:59.220 --> 01:59:02.220
A birthday...

01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:05.220
All right, Dan, we're getting close to closing time,

01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:07.220
but I think it's time for you two to re-init.

01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:09.220
Yeah, we're well past it, but...

01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:12.220
But I'm gonna put it on you right now.

01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:15.220
Say goodbye to Hamilton.

01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:17.220
Thank you, Jeff.

01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:20.220
I started here...

01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:25.220
How can I?

01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:28.220
The year was 2012.

01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:35.220
Rob,

01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:37.220
can we all give it up for...

01:59:37.220 --> 01:59:40.220
I think the most joyful part of Hamilton Town,

01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:42.220
in my experience, has been Rob Schrab,

01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:44.220
who contributed.

01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:46.220
Oh, man.

01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:48.220
Thank you, Jeff.

01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:52.220
I don't get it.

01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:55.220
I don't get it.

01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:57.220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.220
Yeah, you see it.

02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:07.220
If you're listening, there's people walking out.

02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:10.220
People are...

02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:13.220
People are stapling themselves to their chairs

02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:16.220
in what I can only describe as a reverse ovation.

02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:23.220
Rob Schrab.

02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:25.220
I don't know what to say.

02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:29.220
I really don't know what to say about any of that.

02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:32.220
You're in the middle of a very complicated racial orio.

02:00:32.220 --> 02:00:34.220
There's a lot of pressure on you.

02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:36.220
It's an inverted, yeah.

02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:38.220
Well, I don't know.

02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:41.220
About a year or two years ago,

02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:44.220
I was going through a pretty dark time.

02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:47.220
And that's when I started coming to the show regularly,

02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:52.220
and it really, really helped me get back on my feet,

02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:54.220
you know, like, just mentally.

02:00:54.220 --> 02:00:56.220
I'll take it from here.

02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:59.220
Yeah, please. I'm about to drop it.

02:00:59.220 --> 02:01:02.220
But it just made me feel less alone,

02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:05.220
and, you know, I was just...

02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:09.220
Yeah, I just hit a deep, deep valley creatively,

02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:12.220
and just...

02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:14.220
I don't know, and just being here,

02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:16.220
and, you know, it was really...

02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:20.220
I mean, it was how I got to hang out with my friends,

02:01:20.220 --> 02:01:27.220
and just getting a lot of love online was very, very sweet.

02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:30.220
It was very sweet.

02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:34.220
And I don't really...

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:38.220
It's not hitting me how much I'm going to miss it yet.

02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:42.220
You know, like, right now, all I'm thinking of, like,

02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:44.220
my knees are so fucking cold right now,

02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:46.220
because it's just, like, freezing.

02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:49.220
It's freezing. It's freezing up here.

02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:51.220
Why just your knees? What's...

02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:54.220
I don't know. Like, this area, like, is right here.

02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:56.220
Are your knees cold? You got some cold knees?

02:01:56.220 --> 02:02:00.220
No, no one has your weird Midwestern old man's disease.

02:02:00.220 --> 02:02:02.220
Winter's coming. I take it back.

02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:04.220
I don't miss this. My kneecaps are blushing.

02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:07.220
I'm not going to miss this. I'm not going to miss this.

02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:10.220
I do want to say the reason I brought up the Duncan Trussell thing

02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:13.220
and podcasting in general is because...

02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:15.220
What is it?

02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:17.220
What's happening?

02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:20.220
It's just the haunted house music is just playing.

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:22.220
This is Jeff's outgoing voicemail.

02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:25.220
It's a get used to it song.

02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:29.220
No, no. Oh, you were talking to him.

02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:32.220
Well, this is just as good as you're thinking.

02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:37.220
Uh...

02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:40.220
As a...

02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:44.220
Thank you so much, man, for being like me.

02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:48.220
And, like, yeah, we'll feel this 20 years from now,

02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:50.220
and that's because we're better people.

02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:51.220
I'm already feeling it.

02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:52.220
Well, yeah, me too.

02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:54.220
I don't know what we're talking about.

02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:57.220
The reason I brought up the Duncan Trussell thing

02:02:57.220 --> 02:03:01.220
was also because, like, I want you guys to understand

02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:03.220
everyone within the reach of my voice,

02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:07.220
that, like, I have been addicted to podcasts

02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:09.220
and have relationships with podcasts,

02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:12.220
so I understand.

02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:17.220
And that's why I'm so grateful to you guys for making it,

02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:20.220
for choosing it, because there has to be a lot of forgiveness

02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:23.220
involved, and there's an addiction that is really...

02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:25.220
It reflects the best part of you,

02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:28.220
where you're like, you know, warts and all,

02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:31.220
I'm gonna just keep coming back to this, and I choose this

02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:32.220
to be my family.

02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:34.220
And I...

02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:36.220
That, like, in saying goodbye,

02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:39.220
I want you guys to really hear me on this,

02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:43.220
that, like, I'm old and tired and really looking forward

02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:45.220
to woodwork and, like...

02:03:45.220 --> 02:03:49.220
Like, just kind of, like, not being myself

02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:51.220
as a famous person for a while,

02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:53.220
that has absolutely nothing to do with the advice

02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:56.220
I would give you if you're 25 and you're...

02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:59.220
Or 75, but spiritually 25,

02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:01.220
because you're just now going, like,

02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:03.220
what the fuck should I do tomorrow?

02:04:03.220 --> 02:04:05.220
Like, please put yourself out there.

02:04:05.220 --> 02:04:09.220
Don't give up on the transparency and vulnerability

02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:13.220
and honesty as the eventual cure-all

02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:15.220
in the war between good and evil.

02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:18.220
Like, I am not waving a white flag.

02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:20.220
I am, like, laying down and taking a long nap

02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:22.220
after a Thanksgiving dinner.

02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:25.220
Like, I am fat and sad and tired.

02:04:25.220 --> 02:04:28.220
Or not sad, sad, sad, like, the way you're sad,

02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:30.220
because Wizard of Oz is on again.

02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:31.220
Like, like...

02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:33.220
Like, not sad.

02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:34.220
Not pathetic.

02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:36.220
But, like, like, full, done.

02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:39.220
Like, like, like, like, that's sad.

02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:41.220
Like, like, like, please...

02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:44.220
Like, if the things that you guys say

02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:46.220
about, like, what inspired you about it,

02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:48.220
stick with that, go with that.

02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:51.220
I'm not ending it because those things don't work

02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:53.220
and don't make me very happy.

02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:55.220
And I got to say to a lot of you kids

02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:58.220
who have said to me, you know,

02:04:58.220 --> 02:05:01.220
shared the incredibly personal and touchy

02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:04.220
topic of being close to the edge

02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:07.220
at certain times, which is not an abnormal thing

02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:09.220
and not something to be ashamed of

02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:12.220
and something you absolutely should share with somebody.

02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:14.220
I have been there, too,

02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:17.220
and this podcast has kept me away from that ledge.

02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:21.220
And so definitely fucking, like,

02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:23.220
follow your bliss.

02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:27.220
If you are so sad that this podcast is ending,

02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:30.220
this may be your cue now to,

02:05:30.220 --> 02:05:33.220
whether it's a podcast or a basil garden

02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:35.220
on your windowsill or a rocking chair,

02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:38.220
like, you, like, do that project.

02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:39.220
Do that thing.

02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:42.220
New action creates new thought.

02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:44.220
Don't fucking check out on me.

02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:47.220
The world has sucked since way before you were born.

02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:50.220
Like, that's not a logical decision.

02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:53.220
Like, this too shall pass.

02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:54.220
Stick with me.

02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:55.220
Be exceptional.

02:05:55.220 --> 02:05:57.220
Tell me this story 20 years from now

02:05:57.220 --> 02:05:59.220
when you run into me at a bar.

02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:01.220
I thank you so much for being here for me.

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:03.220
You saved my life.

02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:05.220
Also, Spencer Crittenden,

02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:08.220
what would the world be without meeting a Spencer?

02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:10.220
Can we please give a huge...

02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:15.220
There would be no Harmon Quest.

02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:17.220
Yeah.

02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:19.220
Oh, no.

02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:21.220
Spencer loves this.

02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:23.220
He loves it.

02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:27.220
Check out Color of Chaos on DM's Guild.

02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:31.220
It's an advertisement.

02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:35.220
And Brandon Johnson and Steve Levy

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:39.220
and DeMorge Brown and Curtis Armstrong

02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:42.220
and all the people that we've had together.

02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:45.220
And also, look around.

02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:47.220
Give everybody next to you a hug

02:06:47.220 --> 02:06:49.220
because you guys are all the greatest.

02:06:49.220 --> 02:06:52.220
I'm gonna cry because I'm a crier.

02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:54.220
I love you all so much.

02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:57.220
Mike Eagle, everybody, give it up for Mike.

02:06:57.220 --> 02:06:59.220
Thank you for being here.

02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:02.220
Give it up for Kumail Nanjiani, Emily Gordon.

02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:07.220
All y'all, thank you so much.

02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:09.220
Let's all go next door and have a drink together.

02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:12.220
I'm gonna get sad and cry.

02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:17.220
I've been your comptroller, Jeff Davis.

02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:19.220
Your mayor, Dan Harmon.

02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:26.220
Drive fast.

02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:28.220
Take chances.

02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:30.220
Let's hug it down.

02:07:31.220 --> 02:07:34.220
Oh, here comes the dance product.

02:07:34.220 --> 02:07:37.220
Trap, Harmon, get a dance.

02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:39.220
Well, from the beginning,

02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:41.220
we've never known how to do an ending.

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:43.220
We've always had the show go on too long

02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:45.220
and this is the name of that rap song.

02:07:45.220 --> 02:07:47.220
It's too long, the show's too long.

02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:49.220
This is the name of that rap song.

02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:51.220
I have a small ding-dong

02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:54.220
and that's apparently why global warming is happening.

02:07:56.220 --> 02:07:58.220
Good night. See you next door.

02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:05.220
Thank y'all.

02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:07.220
The next Harmon...

02:08:07.220 --> 02:08:09.220
Not Harmon-chan, but the next podcast is yet to come.

02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:11.220
I'll keep you posted.

02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:13.220
So, look alive.

02:08:31.220 --> 02:08:33.220
Did you get any of that?

02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:35.220
It's a good show.
