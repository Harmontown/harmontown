the reason why we started this.\n\n08:24.220 --> 08:26.220\nShe said she wanted to be here when it died.\n\n08:26.220 --> 08:28.220\nWhich you can take in two different ways.\n\n08:28.220 --> 08:30.220\nShe's at Stonehenge right now,\n\n08:30.220 --> 08:32.220\nso she's in a place of sacrifice.\n\n08:36.220 --> 08:38.220\nBut for real, there was no reason\n\n08:38.220 --> 08:40.220\nthe show should have lasted more than a year.\n\n08:40.220 --> 08:42.220\nIt was crazy.\n\n08:42.220 --> 08:44.220\nWe started monthly, right?\n\n08:44.220 --> 08:46.220\nAnd then it became weekly.\n\n08:46.220 --> 08:48.220\nAnd then for some stupid reason,\n\n08:48.220 --> 08:50.220\nit was two hours every fucking time.\n\n08:52.220 --> 08:54.220\nI'm only happy that it won't be\n\n08:54.220 --> 08:56.220\ntwo hours of my life every week.\n\n08:56.220 --> 08:58.220\nBut I've met a bunch of people\n\n08:58.220 --> 09:00.220\nthat travel from all over the planet.\n\n09:00.220 --> 09:02.220\nThere's people from Spain here,\n\n09:02.220 --> 09:04.220\nthere's people from Italy,\n\n09:04.220 --> 09:06.220\nthere's people from...\n\n09:06.220 -->

all these format rules,\n\n09:16.220 --> 09:18.220\nand one of them is that I stand out there\n\n09:18.220 --> 09:20.220\nand talk, but then the guest\n\n09:20.220 --> 09:22.220\ncomes out and then I take my seat,\n\n09:22.220 --> 09:24.220\nso I'm just going to sit down now.\n\n09:24.220 --> 09:26.220\nIt's a natural pillar to the show.\n\n09:26.220 --> 09:28.220\nYeah, it's structure.\n\n09:28.220 --> 09:30.220\nBut thinking about the time that we met Spencer\n\n09:30.220 --> 09:32.220\nfor the first time, how many episodes\n\n09:32.220 --> 09:34.220\nwere we in when Spencer...\n\n09:34.220 --> 09:36.220\nI was like episode five or something.\n\n09:36.220 --> 09:38.220\nFive?\n\n09:38.220 --> 09:40.220\nSo that was before it was...\n\n09:40.220 --> 09:42.220\na video, that was back when it was just...\n\n09:42.220 --> 09:44.220\nNo video back then.\n\n09:44.220 --> 09:46.220\nYou know the cops can...\n\n09:46.220 --> 09:48.220\nin America...\n\n09:48.220 --> 09:50.220\nThey can shoot you.\n\n09:50.220 --> 09:52.220\nWith guns.\n\n09:52.220 --> 09:54.220\nThey can lie to you about\n\n09:54.220 --> 09:56.220\nwhat they have on you.\n\n09:56.220 --> 09:58.220\nThey can tell you we found a bloody fingerprint\n\n09:58.220 --> 10:00.220\nand it's your fingerprint,\n\n10:00.220 --> 10:02.220\nand they don't have to be telling the truth about that.\n\n10:02.220 --> 10:04.220\nI don't know, good or bad.\n\n10:04.220 --> 10:06.220\nBut here's the thing,\n\n10:06.220 --> 10:08.220\nI just heard this thing on this true crime

part.\n\n10:28.220 --> 10:30.220\nBut a life was lost\n\n10:30.220 --> 10:32.220\nand you know,\n\n10:32.220 --> 10:34.220\nthat's why we listen to true crime,\n\n10:34.220 --> 10:36.220\nbecause it's

37:20.220\nFor instance, Naked Martin, who came into our lives courtesy of\n\n37:20.220 --> 37:24.220\nCody's old roommate, Nicole, who was on this trip with us.\n\n37:24.220 --> 37:27.220\nNicole was doing comedy somewhere,\n\n37:27.220 --> 37:31.220\nand some British couple where at the bar,\n\n37:31.220 --> 37:34.220\ngetting shit-faced, and they were like looking at some video on their phone,\n\n37:34.220 --> 37:37.220\nand they're like, do you want to see the funniest video ever?\n\n37:37.220 --> 37:40.220\nAnd it was like, there's this British guy,\n\n37:40.220 --> 37:45.220\nand he's like looking at the camera, and he says,\n\n37:45.220 --> 37:49.220\nhello, Alex and Peggy.\n\n37:49.220 --> 37:52.220\nHe gives us this personalized message,\n\n37:52.220 --> 37:56.220\nand goes like, congratulations on your recent engagement.\n\n37:56.220 --> 37:59.220\nHave fun in Hamburg, and stay away from those oranges.\n\n37:59.220 --> 38:01.220\nAnd he gives a little naughty tis-finger.\n\n38:01.220 --> 38:03.220\nBy the way, he's stark-naked,\n\n38:03.220 --> 38:08.220\nand has a, well, what I hope is a super long dick.\n\n38:08.220 --> 38:10.220\nUncircumcised.\n\n38:10.220 --> 38:12.220\nYeah, and it's kind of uncircumcised, and he's very old,\n\n38:12.220 --> 38:14.220\nso it's kind of like, I don't think this is an important detail,\n\n38:14.220 --> 38:16.220\nbut it is a distracting one, that his foreskin has a sort of like...\n\n38:16.220 --> 38:18.220\nWhy do you hope it's super long?\n\n38:18.220 --> 38:19.220\nWas it long?\n\n38:19.220 --> 38:21.220\nWell, because I want...\n\n38:21.220 --> 38:22.220\nYou want us to think...\n\n38:22.220 --> 38:24.220\nI want the average dick size to be smaller than...\n\n38:24.220 --> 38:25.220\nOkay.\n\n38:25.220 --> 38:26.220\nYeah.\n\n38:26.220 --> 38:29.220\nThe smaller, the better.\n\n38:29.220 --> 38:33.220\nI mean, what do you want mortgage rates to be?\n\n38:33.220 --> 38:35.220\nLower.\n\n38:35.220 --> 38:36.220\nI assume.\n\n38:36.220 --> 38:40.220\nI'm totally following it.\n\n38:40.220 --> 38:41.220\nOkay.\n\n38:41.220 --> 38:42.220\nKeep going, keep going.\n\n38:42.220 --> 38:44.220\nYou're not even at the halfway point.\n\n38:44.220 --> 38:48.220\nHe gives a little cautious finger wave about the oranges in Hamburg,\n\n38:48.220 --> 38:53.220\nand flaps his flaccid, but long penis against his naked thighs\n\n38:53.220 --> 38:56.220\nwith a quick twitch of his waist,\n\n38:56.220 --> 39:00.220\nand then he reaches down between his legs to underneath his balls somewhere\n\n39:00.220 --> 39:02.220\nwhile looking at the camera.\n\n39:02.220 --> 39:05.220\nIt gets a curious, contemplative look on his face,\n\n39:05.220 --> 39:09.220\nand he's kind of like moving his fingers around a bit back there.\n\n39:09.220 --> 39:12.220\nIt's a very, very strange, long pause.\n\n39:12.220 --> 39:14.220\nYou don't know what's really going on,\n\n39:14.220 --> 39:16.220\nand then he withdraws a...\n\n39:16.220 --> 39:17.220\nHuman turd.\n\n39:17.220 --> 39:18.220\n...a bowel movement.\n\n39:18.220 --> 39:19.220\nNo.\n\n39:19.220 --> 39:20.220\nYeah, I know.\n\n39:20.220 --> 39:21.220\nWait, what?\n\n39:21.220 --> 39:22.220\nHe withdraws a poop?\n\n39:22.220 --> 39:23.220\nYeah.\n\n39:23.220 --> 39:24.220\nWith his hands?\n\n39:24.220 --> 39:26.220\nAnd then he kind of presents it pridefully,\n\n39:26.220 --> 39:28.220\nand then he smears it all over his face.\n\n39:28.220 --> 39:29.220\nNo!\n\n39:29.220 --> 39:31.220\nAnd he gives a thumbs up.\n\n39:31.220 --> 39:32.220\nIs it Gigi Allen?\n\n39:32.220 --> 39:34.220\nWhat the fuck are you watching?\n\n39:34.220 --> 39:35.220\nSnake and Martin.\n\n39:35.220 --> 39:37.220\nThis is somebody you're still friends with?\n\n39:37.220 --> 39:39.220\nI will only say one thing about this.\n\n39:39.220 --> 39:42.220\nThis is the weird thing if you ever see the video.\n\n39:42.220 --> 39:44.220\nThere's a video.\n\n39:44.220 --> 39:45.220\nHis poop is...\n\n39:45.220 --> 39:46.220\nIt's a video, yeah.\n\n39:46.220 --> 39:47.220\nWhat?\n\n39:47.220 --> 39:48.220\nHe pulls a poop out of his butt?\n\n39:48.220 --> 39:49.220\nYeah.\n\n39:49.220 --> 39:51.220\nAnd puts it on his face.\n\n39:51.220 --> 39:56.220\nAfter he congratulated somebody on their engagement.\n\n39:56.220 --> 40:02.220\nI think it's important to note that his poop in that particular video,\n\n40:02.220 --> 40:04.220\nand I know I'll describe this in like,\n\n40:04.220 --> 40:05.220\nthat's not possible,\n\n40:05.220 --> 40:09.220\nbut it's like, it's so healthy looking\n\n40:09.220 --> 40:12.220\nthat it's basically not gross\n\n40:12.220 --> 40:14.220\nto watch him smeared across his face.\n\n40:14.220 --> 40:18.220\nIt looks like just how you would imagine\n\n40:18.220 --> 40:20.220\na perfectly healthy bowel movement.\n\n40:20.220 --> 40:21.220\nIt's just perfectly textured.\n\n40:21.220 --> 40:24.220\nIt's like a clip part of a turd.\n\n40:24.220 --> 40:27.220\nAnd it almost looks comfortable.\n\n40:27.220 --> 40:29.220\nHe clearly enjoys doing it.\n\n40:29.220 --> 40:32.220\nTell me again how you came about this video clip.\n\n40:32.220 --> 40:36.220\nCody's old roommate ran into some strangers,\n\n40:36.220 --> 40:38.220\nso she got the video from them.\n\n40:38.220 --> 40:41.220\nThey were affiliated with this wedding engagement\n\n40:41.220 --> 40:43.220\nthat someone, one of the guests or something,\n\n40:43.220 --> 40:45.220\nhad tapped this fella.\n\n40:45.220 --> 40:47.220\nYou're three steps away from an actual human being.\n\n40:47.220 --> 40:49.220\nThis is not just random internet stuff.\n\n40:49.220 --> 40:51.220\nSo we tracked him down in the Rick and Morty writer's room,\n\n40:51.220 --> 40:53.220\nlike we were looking around for this guy,\n\n40:53.220 --> 40:54.220\nand somebody found him.\n\n40:54.220 --> 40:55.220\nHis name is Naked Martin,\n\n40:55.220 --> 40:57.220\nand what I kept trying to figure out,\n\n40:57.220 --> 41:00.220\nand he's a very sweet seeming fella.\n\n41:00.220 --> 41:01.220\nNo.\n\n41:01.220 --> 41:03.220\nNo, I'm telling you.\n\n41:03.220 --> 41:04.220\nDon't do it.\n\n41:04.220 --> 41:05.220\nNo, he's, what?\n\n41:05.220 --> 41:07.220\nDon't try to sell us this dude, please.\n\n41:07.220 --> 41:09.220\nNo, I mean, he's...\n\n41:09.220 --> 41:11.220\nLet's not go out like this, Dan.\n\n41:11.220 --> 41:12.220\nHe's a super pleasant guy.\n\n41:12.220 --> 41:13.220\nNot like this.\n\n41:13.220 --> 41:15.220\nHis bio is like, I'm Naked Martin.\n\n41:15.220 --> 41:17.220\nI'm a nudist that loves to have fun.\n\n41:17.220 --> 41:20.220\nRight poop on his face for your...\n\n41:20.220 --> 41:23.220\nBut it's so healthy, this poop.\n\n41:23.220 --> 41:25.220\nYou got to understand how healthy...\n\n41:25.220 --> 41:28.220\nHow healthy does a poop have to look to me?\n\n41:28.220 --> 41:30.220\nYou can buy coffee mugs.\n\n41:30.220 --> 41:33.220\nYeah, and you can also get, like, a video, if you want.\n\n41:33.220 --> 41:37.220\nMe and Andi is going to be so mad about this promotion.\n\n41:37.220 --> 41:38.220\nOh, no.\n\n41:38.220 --> 41:41.220\nSo then Cody, like, she eventually unbeknownst to me,\n\n41:41.220 --> 41:45.220\nshe orders a video from Naked Martin.\n\n41:45.220 --> 41:47.220\nAnd it was going to be for the anniversary...\n\n41:47.220 --> 41:48.220\nCan you play the audio?\n\n41:48.220 --> 41:50.220\nYou can't play the video, but you can play the audio.\n\n41:50.220 --> 41:51.220\nWhy can't you play the audio?\n\n41:51.220 --> 41:52.220\nI can, but...\n\n41:52.220 --> 41:53.220\nYeah, I mean, it's...\n\n41:53.220 --> 41:54.220\nOh, okay, sorry.\n\n41:54.220 --> 41:55.220\nIt's the last show.\n\n41:55.220 --> 41:58.220\nI just don't know if playing the audio is really that important\n\n41:58.220 --> 42:00.220\nversus the amount of time it's going to spend.\n\n42:00.220 --> 42:01.220\nI agree.\n\n42:01.220 --> 42:02.220\nWell, then don't.\n\n42:02.220 --> 42:03.220\nIt's your show.\n\n42:03.220 --> 42:04.220\nThank you.\n\n42:04.220 --> 42:05.220\nStop doing things.\n\n42:05.220 --> 42:06.220\nWell, I try to...\n\n42:06.220 --> 42:09.220\nAre all of his clips him pooping on things?\n\n42:09.220 --> 42:10.220\nNo.\n\n42:10.220 --> 42:12.220\nSo, like, we were trying to figure that out.\n\n42:12.220 --> 42:15.220\nLike, does this guy like, because it's all about Naked Martin and nudity,\n\n42:15.220 --> 42:22.220\nbut his logo, it looks like the logo is written in shit.\n\n42:22.220 --> 42:23.220\nYes, it is.\n\n42:23.220 --> 42:24.220\nKind of.\n\n42:24.220 --> 42:26.220\nBut it also could be hot dogs?\n\n42:26.220 --> 42:27.220\nNo.\n\n42:27.220 --> 42:28.220\nNo.\n\n42:28.220 --> 42:30.220\nHe didn't smear hot dogs on his face.\n\n42:30.220 --> 42:31.220\nHot dogs are...\n\n42:31.220 --> 42:32.220\nNo, no, no.\n\n42:32.220 --> 42:33.220\nTurds.\n\n42:33.220 --> 42:34.220\nTurds.\n\n42:34.220 --> 42:35.220\nThere's turds.\n\n42:35.220 --> 42:39.220\nWhy don't you know the difference between hot dogs and shit?\n\n42:39.220 --> 42:40.220\nYeah.\n\n42:40.220 --> 42:42.220\nHow did that happen?\n\n42:42.220 --> 42:44.220\nI think it's possible for a graphic designer to not know the difference.\n\n42:44.220 --> 42:48.220\nI'd like to give a special shout out to people that traveled here to see this final show.\n\n42:48.220 --> 42:49.220\nOkay.\n\n42:49.220 --> 42:50.220\nWell, here's the thing.\n\n42:50.220 --> 42:53.220\nKeep going, talking about the video.\n\n42:53.220 --> 42:57.220\nI mean, I want so badly to just, like, hand it off to Jeff now and go,\n\n42:57.220 --> 42:59.220\nlike, no, no, yeah, let's abort this immediately.\n\n42:59.220 --> 43:00.220\nLet's clear it.\n\n43:00.220 --> 43:01.220\nNo, but what...\n\n43:01.220 --> 43:02.220\nSo, go on.\n\n43:02.220 --> 43:03.220\nOh, you have questions about this guy?\n\n43:03.220 --> 43:04.220\nI mean...\n\n43:04.220 --> 43:05.220\nI have a hundred questions.\n\n43:05.220 --> 43:06.220\nEven though we're doing a show?\n\n43:06.220 --> 43:07.220\nYes.\n\n43:07.220 --> 43:14.220\nI mean, my first question is, what was the origin story of you finding this person,\n\n43:14.220 --> 43:17.220\nand how did this become a part of your life?\n\n43:17.220 --> 43:18.220\nSo, you're interested?\n\n43:18.220 --> 43:19.220\nYes.\n\n43:19.220 --> 43:20.220\nOkay.\n\n43:20.220 --> 43:23.220\nOh, I'm in.\n\n43:23.220 --> 43:26.220\nSo, the...\n\n43:26.220 --> 43:30.220\nCody comes up to me a month later, a couple of weeks later,\n\n43:30.220 --> 43:32.220\nand she's kind of sadly, she goes like,\n\n43:32.220 --> 43:37.220\nI was gonna, I got something for our engagement, which is not until Christmas time,\n\n43:37.220 --> 43:43.220\nour anniversary for our engagement, but it didn't go as well as I thought it would.\n\n43:43.220 --> 43:46.220\nAnd so, I'm just gonna give it to you now.\n\n43:46.220 --> 43:52.220\nAnd it's naked Martin is sitting and kneeling in a kitchen.\n\n43:52.220 --> 43:57.220\nEverything about the video is like, the first one, I gotta go back and describe the first one,\n\n43:57.220 --> 44:02.220\nbecause it's like, he's out in like, a beautiful lush, day-lit garden.\n\n44:02.220 --> 44:05.220\nLike, all you can see behind him is just foliage.\n\n44:05.220 --> 44:09.220\nAnd he's just, he's very chipper and crisp and the video,\n\n44:09.220 --> 44:14.220\nand as I described, like, from the texture of the shit to his deployment of it,\n\n44:14.220 --> 44:19.220\neverything is just sort of like, it looks as if he's done it a thousand times and loves it.\n\n44:19.220 --> 44:21.220\nHe's smiling, he's glowing.\n\n44:21.220 --> 44:24.220\nAnd it's his own poop.\n\n44:24.220 --> 44:37.220\nNo, he reaches between his naked legs where he's cleverly releasing a bag of someone else's shit,\n\n44:37.220 --> 44:43.220\nbecause he wants to save himself a gross and tedious task of withdrawing his own.\n\n44:43.220 --> 44:45.220\nYes, I think it's his own shit.\n\n44:45.220 --> 44:49.220\nI'm trying to think what's worse, his own poop or somebody else's poop.\n\n44:49.220 --> 44:55.220\nBut it is notable that it's all so cleanly done in that first video that that is a question that comes to your mind,\n\n44:55.220 --> 44:58.220\nis like, is that really, can you just do that?\n\n44:58.220 --> 45:01.220\nCan you just reach back there and like, I'll wrap it from a hat.\n\n45:01.220 --> 45:05.220\nLike, it's just in one piece, like, there's nothing gross about it.\n\n45:05.220 --> 45:10.220\nWhy is there nothing gross about it?\n\n45:10.220 --> 45:18.220\nIt's shocking, but it's not, I think you'll find like, stuff like, with shit is like,\n\n45:18.220 --> 45:22.220\nit's the details, it's the sloppy organic details.\n\n45:22.220 --> 45:24.220\nThat's what we don't like about shit.\n\n45:24.220 --> 45:28.220\nIt's like chaos and it's like everything that life is done with.\n\n45:28.220 --> 45:32.220\nAnd as such, it behaves in no predictable way and things.\n\n45:32.220 --> 45:35.220\nAnd then when you draw like a cartoon turd, you can, you don't like,\n\n45:35.220 --> 45:41.220\nmost people don't like react to a drawing of a turd that looks like a little Hershey's kiss with stink lines coming off of it.\n\n45:41.220 --> 45:44.220\nIt's like, we don't gag because it makes us think of real shit.\n\n45:44.220 --> 45:49.220\nLike, but anyway, so like, I'm telling you, the guy's turd was a cartoon.\n\n45:49.220 --> 45:51.220\nSo then Cody's video.\n\n45:51.220 --> 45:55.220\nSo it's like, he says, he's kneeling in a kitchen.\n\n45:55.220 --> 45:58.220\nSo it's already like, ah, just feels, why is he kneeling?\n\n45:58.220 --> 46:03.220\nAnd there's like, there's like sauce pans hanging from it.\n\n46:03.220 --> 46:06.220\nDo we know, do we know it's his kitchen or is he somebody else's kitchen?\n\n46:06.220 --> 46:13.220\nI hope that he gets so many of these videos ordered that every weekend he rents a B&B and knocks them all out\n\n46:13.220 --> 46:20.220\nand just leaves a $500 tip for the cleaning staff and just walks away the happiest guy in the world.\n\n46:20.220 --> 46:25.220\nI really am telling you, if you see this guy's bio, you're going to, you're going to, you're going to love this guy.\n\n46:25.220 --> 46:29.220\nHe's like, he represents all that is like, like unassuming and pure.\n\n46:29.220 --> 46:31.220\nHe's, he's hurting nobody.\n\n46:31.220 --> 46:34.220\nAnd there's not enough people like him in the world.\n\n46:34.220 --> 46:35.220\nThere I said it.\n\n46:35.220 --> 46:40.220\nBut, but what I could never figure out is like, well, does he love, does he love the shit stuff?\n\n46:40.220 --> 46:43.220\nOr is that what people are like requesting?\n\n46:43.220 --> 46:45.220\nBecause he says like, I'll do anything.\n\n46:45.220 --> 46:50.220\nAnd then our people like rub shit on your face and he's like, well, I'll do that too.\n\n46:50.220 --> 46:51.220\nOr is he like, I love shit.\n\n46:51.220 --> 46:54.220\nLike you can't see anything at his site about like shit play.\n\n46:54.220 --> 47:01.220\nBut then, so then Cody ordered this video and it says, he goes, he's kneeling in the kitchen and he says, Dan,\n\n47:01.220 --> 47:05.220\nit's been one year since you said yes to Cody proposing to you.\n\n47:05.220 --> 47:09.220\nAnd she just wants you to know that she thinks you're the shit.\n\n47:09.220 --> 47:12.220\nAnd what?\n\n47:12.220 --> 47:17.220\nAnd, and Cody did not ask him to do this part, but he now turns around.\n\n47:17.220 --> 47:20.220\nAnd this is definitely his shit.\n\n47:20.220 --> 47:22.220\nOh, look, it's, it's Jesse.\n\n47:22.220 --> 47:23.220\nJesse camp.\n\n47:23.220 --> 47:24.220\nWhat's up, Jesse?\n\n47:24.220 --> 47:25.220\nYeah.\n\n47:25.220 --> 47:26.220\nWait, wait.\n\n47:26.220 --> 47:28.220\nSo she commissioned this guy.\n\n47:28.220 --> 47:29.220\nYeah.\n\n47:29.220 --> 47:30.220\nSo he turns around.\n\n47:30.220 --> 47:31.220\nShe commissioned this shit to be taken.\n\n47:31.220 --> 47:35.220\nHe turns around on his knees and then it starts to do the same thing he did.\n\n47:35.220 --> 47:37.220\nBut now it's a completely different view.\n\n47:37.220 --> 47:38.220\nIt's no longer a mystery.\n\n47:38.220 --> 47:39.220\nRight.\n\n47:39.220 --> 47:43.220\nIt's, and it's, and, and the rabbit does not just come out of a hat.\n\n47:43.220 --> 47:52.220\nLike there's a, there's a piece of rabbit that falls on the, the hardwood floor with an audible kind of sound.\n\n47:52.220 --> 48:00.220\nAnd then he turns back around with his shit now in his hand and he, Cody had asked him, she was really sad.\n\n48:00.220 --> 48:04.220\nThat's why she just, she just waved the white flag and gave it to me a month early.\n\n48:04.220 --> 48:09.220\nCause it's like, she, she is like, it's, he's, I was like, what is he doing?\n\n48:09.220 --> 48:12.220\nHe's supposed to be a heart.\n\n48:12.220 --> 48:19.220\nHe's trying to, he's, he's like trying to draw a heart on his chest.\n\n48:19.220 --> 48:20.220\nWith, with his own poop?\n\n48:20.220 --> 48:25.220\nIt just looks like this circle and it's just like, there's so much texture to the chest hair.\n\n48:25.220 --> 48:33.220\nAnd, and so, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then he gives a thumbs up and then he presses a button on,\n\n48:33.220 --> 48:36.220\non something next to him that is apparently supposed to stop the video.\n\n48:36.220 --> 48:39.220\nAnd then there's like a eight second pause.\n\n48:39.220 --> 48:45.220\nAnd then he, and then he kind of does a couple of false starts and then he starts in a, and then the video ends.\n\n48:45.220 --> 48:50.220\nSo the whole thing is just sort of like, you're just like, man, I hope he's happy.\n\n48:50.220 --> 48:51.220\nYeah.\n\n48:51.220 --> 48:52.220\nYeah.\n\n48:52.220 --> 48:54.220\nLike I want to think that he's living the best life.\n\n48:54.220 --> 48:56.220\nHow much did Cody pay him for this?\n\n48:56.220 --> 48:58.220\nIs this a commission?\n\n48:58.220 --> 49:01.220\n80 pounds, which is 103 American dollars.\n\n49:01.220 --> 49:02.220\nThat's not enough money.\n\n49:02.220 --> 49:03.220\nNo, it's not.\n\n49:03.220 --> 49:04.220\nIt is not.\n\n49:04.220 --> 49:06.220\nThat's the thing that makes me assume that he likes it.\n\n49:06.220 --> 49:09.220\nOr I think it might be a little bit too much money.\n\n49:09.220 --> 49:16.220\nI think he should be charging $1,000 minimum to, it costs $100 to clean that shit up, man.\n\n49:16.220 --> 49:22.220\nHe costs $100 to clean that shit up.\n\n49:22.220 --> 49:31.220\nThat's, that's what gives me the, the hope that I think, I think he must, he must be enjoying it because otherwise he charged $50,000.\n\n49:31.220 --> 49:32.220\nLike we would, right?\n\n49:32.220 --> 49:35.220\nHow much would we charge to rub our own shit on it?\n\n49:35.220 --> 49:37.220\nMike Eagle, how much would you charge for that?\n\n49:37.220 --> 49:38.220\nHow much?\n\n49:38.220 --> 49:39.220\nIf you had to do it.\n\n49:39.220 --> 49:40.220\nWhat's your base rate?\n\n49:40.220 --> 49:42.220\nI had to do it and I had to make a video of it.\n\n49:42.220 --> 49:43.220\nYeah.\n\n49:43.220 --> 49:44.220\nBase rate.\n\n49:44.220 --> 49:47.220\nIn a normal video format that can be fucking shown to anybody.\n\n49:47.220 --> 49:48.220\nRight.\n\n49:48.220 --> 49:49.220\nYeah.\n\n49:49.220 --> 49:50.220\nYou could be naked Mike Eagle.\n\n49:50.220 --> 49:51.220\nBase now on.\n\n49:51.220 --> 49:52.220\nNaked shit rubbing Mike Eagle.\n\n49:52.220 --> 49:53.220\n$74 million.\n\n49:53.220 --> 50:00.220\nSee, that's a guy that's like, yeah, because you're, you're, like I said, when you do what\n\n50:00.220 --> 50:03.220\nyou love, right, you don't, you don't have to work a day in your life.\n\n50:03.220 --> 50:08.220\nAnd you're like, your, your goal as his mind is like, yeah, there's no, there's no price\n\n50:08.220 --> 50:12.220\nyou could put on your ability to be open Mike and do what you want.\n\n50:12.220 --> 50:20.220\nIt would need to be so much money for you to shatter that all that you'd have to be set up for life.\n\n50:20.220 --> 50:21.220\nYeah.\n\n50:21.220 --> 50:25.220\nAnd if you did anything for 10,000 hours, you become an expert at it.\n\n50:25.220 --> 50:26.220\nYeah.\n\n50:26.220 --> 50:27.220\nAnd he said,\n\n50:27.220 --> 50:28.220\nShould be paid for expertise.\n\n50:28.220 --> 50:29.220\nYeah.\n\n50:29.220 --> 50:30.220\nYeah.\n\n50:30.220 --> 50:32.220\nHe references a thing on his website about.\n\n50:32.220 --> 50:33.220\nWhy is 74 million?\n\n50:33.220 --> 50:34.220\nThat's a, that's a weird specific number.\n\n50:34.220 --> 50:40.220\nIt's the highest number I could make with my mouth right now.\n\n50:40.220 --> 50:44.220\nI think I, I, I feel that I, I've actually rift that number once I think on this stage,\n\n50:44.220 --> 50:47.220\nor I might have said 175, but it's like 70.\n\n50:47.220 --> 50:50.220\nIt's like got the most syllables or something.\n\n50:50.220 --> 50:51.220\n75 million.\n\n50:51.220 --> 50:58.220\nTo me, it feels like that amount of money you could even if you weren't a financial wizard,\n\n50:58.220 --> 51:01.220\nyou could figure out a way to live off of interest.\n\n51:01.220 --> 51:02.220\nYes.\n\n51:02.220 --> 51:03.220\nThat's like that.\n\n51:03.220 --> 51:08.220\nLike maybe you have the small house in Sherman Oaks, but you're like only I just put the 75\n\n51:08.220 --> 51:13.220\nmillion on a pile and the pile just radiates money that I live off of every day.\n\n51:13.220 --> 51:15.220\nI probably wouldn't do that.\n\n51:15.220 --> 51:18.220\nI'd probably buy a fucking gold boat that sank.\n\n51:18.220 --> 51:20.220\nBut then you got a gold boat.\n\n51:20.220 --> 51:23.220\nThen you got to make another shit video.\n\n51:23.220 --> 51:25.220\nI made a gold boat.\n\n51:25.220 --> 51:28.220\nYeah, you got to go on that shit video money.\n\n51:28.220 --> 51:33.220\nOh, one more detail, because is that, is that Cody had, you know, she gave him a shout out\n\n51:33.220 --> 51:36.220\nor whatever she showed, like a frame grab or something like that on her Instagram.\n\n51:36.220 --> 51:40.220\nAnd he, he messaged her and said, thanks for the shout out.\n\n51:40.220 --> 51:44.220\nLike, like he was appreciative of her getting the word out, lest anybody think for some reason\n\n51:44.220 --> 51:49.220\nthat a guy that sells this service wants to keep it on the down low and is somehow going\n\n51:49.220 --> 51:52.220\nto be hampered by this getting out.\n\n51:52.220 --> 51:54.220\nYou know how much shit is on his phone screen?\n\n51:54.220 --> 51:58.220\nThere's just shit particles all over his fucking phone screen.\n\n51:58.220 --> 52:03.220\nHe's, he's, I'm telling you, you're going to, I feel bad that this is the last episode\n\n52:03.220 --> 52:09.220\nbecause it's because in episode 361, there would be a lot of people coming back on the show\n\n52:09.220 --> 52:12.220\nto say, I can't believe it, but you're right.\n\n52:12.220 --> 52:17.220\nHe seems fastidious and pleasant and I'm in his, I'm rooting for him.\n\n52:17.220 --> 52:20.220\nHe seems like a wonderful man that I want to be happy.\n\n52:20.220 --> 52:24.220\nLevy, Levy just came out and showed me a clip and his, if that's his flaccid dick,\n\n52:24.220 --> 52:28.220\nit's, it's a pretty, it's a pretty good size, pretty like, it's a big dick.\n\n52:28.220 --> 52:29.220\nYeah.\n\n52:29.220 --> 52:30.220\nYeah.\n\n52:30.220 --> 52:36.220\nHis willingness to be nude, I get.\n\n52:36.220 --> 52:38.220\nHe probably does that for free.\n\n52:38.220 --> 52:39.220\nYeah.\n\n52:39.220 --> 52:40.220\nWhy the poop?\n\n52:40.220 --> 52:41.220\nI don't get it.\n\n52:41.220 --> 52:42.220\nMy friends that were in a band.\n\n52:42.220 --> 52:43.220\nYou're talking about it.\n\n52:43.220 --> 52:49.220\nMy friends, I grew up with, there's a band called Croms, a C-R-O-M with an umla for no reason\n\n52:49.220 --> 52:53.220\nand they're like a grindcore, like death metal band.\n\n52:53.220 --> 52:55.220\nAnd you know Crom?\n\n52:55.220 --> 52:56.220\nOh fuck, yeah.\n\n52:56.220 --> 52:58.220\nOh fuck, one person, that's awesome.\n\n52:58.220 --> 52:59.220\nYeah.\n\n52:59.220 --> 53:04.220\nThey, they would, they would throw these parties and they had a DVD, no, sorry, a VHS tape\n\n53:04.220 --> 53:08.220\nand it said 666, do not watch on it.\n\n53:08.220 --> 53:11.220\nAnd it was a poop, it was a poop video.\n\n53:11.220 --> 53:14.220\nAnd if you watched it, you barfed.\n\n53:14.220 --> 53:18.220\nLike, like, you, like, it was the most volatile thing I've ever seen.\n\n53:18.220 --> 53:23.220\nThere was a guy, it was not black and white, but the color was so bad it was almost black\n\n53:23.220 --> 53:24.220\nand white.\n\n53:24.220 --> 53:27.220\nAnd VHS, yes, thank you sir.\n\n53:27.220 --> 53:30.220\nLook at this, you faking.\n\n53:30.220 --> 53:32.220\nYou faking.\n\n53:32.220 --> 53:35.220\nAnybody could have said VHS.\n\n53:35.220 --> 53:36.220\nYeah.\n\n53:36.220 --> 53:39.220\nName one Crom song, bro.\n\n53:39.220 --> 53:42.220\nName one Crom song.\n\n53:42.220 --> 53:44.220\nName one Crom song, bro.\n\n53:44.220 --> 53:47.220\nName one Crom song.\n\n53:47.220 --> 53:49.220\nIf you, if you, you got to go find Crom.\n\n53:49.220 --> 53:55.220\nThey started a band as a joke, but they, Crom was a cone of the barbarians god.\n\n53:55.220 --> 54:00.220\nAnd so one of their song was Fuck You Wood Pusher because he had to push a stick around\n\n54:00.220 --> 54:02.220\nand there was a grace.\n\n54:02.220 --> 54:05.220\nDon't you say nothing.\n\n54:05.220 --> 54:07.220\nWhat song is called Grace Jones Headbutt?\n\n54:07.220 --> 54:09.220\nOh, Grace Jones Headbutt, yeah, Grace Jones Headbutt, yeah.\n\n54:09.220 --> 54:10.220\nOh man.\n\n54:10.220 --> 54:11.220\nIt goes like this.\n\n54:11.220 --> 54:14.220\nGrace Jones Headbutt.\n\n54:14.220 --> 54:15.220\nYeah.\n\n54:15.220 --> 54:17.220\nI was here.\n\n54:17.220 --> 54:19.220\nYou know, Diddy did the remix.\n\n54:19.220 --> 54:22.220\nBut they had, they had these parties.\n\n54:22.220 --> 54:26.220\nWell, one of the guys in the band is named Will and his name was the Will of Crom because\n\n54:26.220 --> 54:27.220\nhe was a god.\n\n54:27.220 --> 54:33.220\nAnd these motherfuckers did every drug and there was a VHS tape.\n\n54:33.220 --> 54:36.220\n666, do not watch.\n\n54:36.220 --> 54:41.220\nAnd people would just see it and go, oh, I'm going to put that on.\n\n54:41.220 --> 54:49.220\nAnd there was a dude bent over on all fours and a girl next to his butt.\n\n54:49.220 --> 54:52.220\nYes.\n\n54:52.220 --> 54:57.220\nAnd she, and he started, he started the poop and she ate it up like it was like soft serve\n\n54:57.220 --> 55:00.220\nice cream.\n\n55:00.220 --> 55:06.220\nCongratulations on playing out here.\n\n55:06.220 --> 55:08.220\nOh, oh, oh, cheap laughs.\n\n55:08.220 --> 55:09.220\nOh, I love them.\n\n55:09.220 --> 55:11.220\nOh, they're like scrambled eggs.\n\n55:11.220 --> 55:15.220\nI can attack a whole day now.\n\n55:15.220 --> 55:17.220\nCarbohydrate surface laughs.\n\n55:17.220 --> 55:21.220\nFucking Snickers bar blood sugar laughs.\n\n55:21.220 --> 55:26.220\nWell, I mean, long story short, she looks, she looks pretty unhappy.\n\n55:26.220 --> 55:31.220\nAnd you watch that, you watch four seconds of that and you have to walk outside and vomit.\n\n55:31.220 --> 55:35.220\nAnd yet there's an audience for that sort of stuff.\n\n55:35.220 --> 55:36.220\nAnd you found it.\n\n55:36.220 --> 55:38.220\nAnd now you and Cody share that with each other.\n\n55:38.220 --> 55:41.220\nI believe I've seen that video or one like it.\n\n55:41.220 --> 55:44.220\nAnd I remember it physically gagging because it is the site of the thing that makes you,\n\n55:44.220 --> 55:45.220\nit makes you rest.\n\n55:45.220 --> 55:48.220\nHere's the bummer.\n\n55:48.220 --> 55:54.220\nHey, here's the, here's the, here's where it gets troublesome.\n\n55:54.220 --> 55:55.220\nTelling on yourself.\n\n55:55.220 --> 56:03.220\nIf you're Canadian or UK, the real sad part is that they don't like it.\n\n56:03.220 --> 56:08.220\nIf they were injured, you're like, okay, these people just, they like to party.\n\n56:08.220 --> 56:09.220\nLike that's their thing.\n\n56:09.220 --> 56:12.220\nBut this guy, this guy doesn't like it.\n\n56:12.220 --> 56:17.220\nIs he going, I'm so sorry.\n\n56:17.220 --> 56:18.220\nI'm so sorry.\n\n56:18.220 --> 56:20.220\nI just remember the, the, so sorry.\n\n56:20.220 --> 56:21.220\nWe got to make rent.\n\n56:21.220 --> 56:22.220\nAre you all right back there?\n\n56:22.220 --> 56:24.220\nThere was 100% sadness.\n\n56:24.220 --> 56:25.220\nThere was all sadness.\n\n56:25.220 --> 56:29.220\nBut then they go back at it and they do it again.\n\n56:29.220 --> 56:31.220\nAnd it's like, it's just, come on, you guys.\n\n56:31.220 --> 56:33.220\nYou watched all of that too?\n\n56:33.220 --> 56:34.220\nHuh?\n\n56:34.220 --> 56:37.220\nSo you watched all of that?\n\n56:37.220 --> 56:38.220\nYeah.\n\n56:38.220 --> 56:42.220\nWell, who likes to party?\n\n56:42.220 --> 56:51.220\nI would say, I would say that this clip had third act troubles.\n\n56:51.220 --> 56:55.220\nI think the third act kind of broke down.\n\n56:55.220 --> 56:57.220\nDon't watch a poop videos where I'm telling you.\n\n56:57.220 --> 57:03.220\nOn that same VHS tape, is there then a like little person?\n\n57:03.220 --> 57:04.220\nNo.\n\n57:04.220 --> 57:05.220\nOkay.\n\n57:05.220 --> 57:06.220\nDo you know what I'm talking about?\n\n57:06.220 --> 57:07.220\nOh yeah, yeah.\n\n57:07.220 --> 57:08.220\nOkay.\n\n57:08.220 --> 57:09.220\nThat was a tape you had.\n\n57:09.220 --> 57:10.220\nYeah.\n\n57:10.220 --> 57:11.220\nThat was a tape that I had.\n\n57:11.220 --> 57:12.220\nOkay.\n\n57:12.220 --> 57:15.220\nWhere, where, where, it was just like.\n\n57:15.220 --> 57:18.220\nI started to feel like I was a bad person for a while.\n\n57:18.220 --> 57:19.220\nNo, no, no.\n\n57:19.220 --> 57:22.220\nThere was a, we were watching a tape that was just, it started off as public access like\n\n57:22.220 --> 57:26.220\nstuff that just got weirder and weirder and more and more degraded as clips.\n\n57:26.220 --> 57:31.220\nWhere it was like bad stand up auditions and then all of a sudden it turns into black and\n\n57:31.220 --> 57:38.220\nwhite and there was a little person dressed up and make up and address and doing like\n\n57:38.220 --> 57:41.220\ntap dancing and was really.\n\n57:41.220 --> 57:44.220\nBut, but, but on the same tape, I'm talking about it too.\n\n57:44.220 --> 57:50.220\nI was trying to like, I was trying to triangulate a tape that I recall having discussed.\n\n57:50.220 --> 57:53.220\nI've never watched a poop video with you two.\n\n57:53.220 --> 57:54.220\nI was a separate poop.\n\n57:54.220 --> 57:58.220\nI'm starting to feel like y'all are the police and this is a lie you're telling me to give\n\n57:58.220 --> 58:00.220\nme to confess to something.\n\n58:00.220 --> 58:01.220\nYeah.\n\n58:01.220 --> 58:04.220\nI didn't fucking do it.\n\n58:04.220 --> 58:05.220\nOkay.\n\n58:05.220 --> 58:10.220\nNo, you ate the poop now.\n\n58:10.220 --> 58:11.220\nCome on.\n\n58:11.220 --> 58:12.220\nAll right.\n\n58:12.220 --> 58:13.220\nMoving on.\n\n58:13.220 --> 58:14.220\nI think that's.\n\n58:14.220 --> 58:16.220\nFingerprints are on the toilet bowl.\n\n58:16.220 --> 58:23.220\nI was, I was playing, so Cody and you know, Cody are my niece to be my common law niece.\n\n58:23.220 --> 58:24.220\nMaya.\n\n58:24.220 --> 58:25.220\nWhat is she?\n\n58:25.220 --> 58:26.220\nThree.\n\n58:26.220 --> 58:29.220\nI think she's three now.\n\n58:29.220 --> 58:31.220\nAbsolutely adorable.\n\n58:31.220 --> 58:33.220\nCommon law niece.\n\n58:33.220 --> 58:38.220\nBecause we haven't set a date for our wedding, but like, you know, she's as good as my niece.\n\n58:38.220 --> 58:40.220\nShe's as good as niece.\n\n58:40.220 --> 58:42.220\nAnd I, it's weird.\n\n58:42.220 --> 58:46.220\nI don't know how to describe her title, you know, so I just keep going like my niece to\n\n58:46.220 --> 58:47.220\nbe.\n\n58:47.220 --> 58:49.220\nPre niece.\n\n58:49.220 --> 58:51.220\nPre niece.\n\n58:51.220 --> 58:53.220\nShe calls me uncle.\n\n58:53.220 --> 58:55.220\nYeah.\n\n58:55.220 --> 59:05.220\nBut we, we, she like, we were playing with her, me and Cody a couple of nights ago and\n\n59:05.220 --> 59:11.220\nthen, you know, like, turns into like a make believe kind of game about how Cody's sick\n\n59:11.220 --> 59:19.220\nand she's a doctor, but she was like, she was like, it was just such a weird like, because\n\n59:19.220 --> 59:26.220\nI, she kept like, Cody and I were brother and sister and a little three year old Maya\n\n59:26.220 --> 59:28.220\nwas, was calling her.\n\n59:28.220 --> 59:32.220\nShe was, she was acting as the doctor that was taking care of Cody, but she was also\n\n59:32.220 --> 59:35.220\nboth our daddy and our mommy.\n\n59:35.220 --> 59:41.220\nAnd she kept sending me to school and it was really weird because she had all of these\n\n59:41.220 --> 59:47.220\nlike, she was like, she, she had no patience for any kind of like, she would, she would\n\n59:47.220 --> 59:49.220\njust go, guess what?\n\n59:49.220 --> 59:51.220\nTo Cody, she's like, you're really sick.\n\n59:51.220 --> 59:52.220\nOh no.\n\n59:52.220 --> 59:53.220\nYou're really sick.\n\n59:53.220 --> 59:57.220\nAnd then she'd look at me and go like, you got to go to school.\n\n59:57.220 --> 01:00:00.220\nAnd then I go, I go like, oh, okay, I'm going to go to school.\n\n01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.220\nAnd she's like, okay, now you're at school.\n\n01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.220\nAnd like, it's over there.\n\n01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:08.220\nIt's sitting in the corner and then she's like, learn your ABCs.\n\n01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.220\nYou're really sick.\n\n01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.220\nAnd then, and then she's like, okay, school's over.\n\n01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.220\nLike, like, I was like, I just got here.\n\n01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:21.220\nAnd then I come back and it was just like this weird cycle, like this weird simulator\n\n01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:27.220\nthat was being run by this three year old who doesn't understand any rules about timing,\n\n01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:35.220\noverkill, sadism, munchausen by proxy syndrome, which was a big theme because she kept making\n\n01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.220\nCody sicker and sicker.\n\n01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:46.220\nAnd she was, but it was, like she was, she was like, she gradually like kept escalating in terms of like the empathy that she was having for Cody.\n\n01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:50.220\nLike it was like the game she wanted to play was like that she was like, she was like, it's okay.\n\n01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.220\nIt's okay.\n\n01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:54.220\nAnd Cody, Cody was like, oh, I feel sick.\n\n01:00:54.220 --> 01:01:03.220\nAnd then she was like, it finally like, after like five iterations of like my weird life where I am, as I kept commenting,\n\n01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:11.220\nI'm like, I feel like I'm wasting the better parts of my life while my sister's at home dying.\n\n01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:15.220\nI'm learning the ABCs and my teacher's three.\n\n01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.220\nSo like half of the alphabet is QRS.\n\n01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:23.220\nLike, she's an A, B, Q, R, S, T, B, I, but W, Q, R, S.\n\n01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:27.220\nLike she doesn't, I mean, she's whoop, whoop.\n\n01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:34.220\nBut it's, it's her curriculum and it's a, it's a school district with one student and the school day is 10 seconds long.\n\n01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:39.220\nBut it's like, after five iterations, they come back to the bed, which is our house.\n\n01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:44.220\nAnd, and, and, and Maya looks at Cody and goes, hey, guess what?\n\n01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.220\nCody's like, what?\n\n01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.220\nHe's like, you're dying.\n\n01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.220\nOh, no.\n\n01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.220\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.220\nYou're going to die.\n\n01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.220\nAnd Cody's like, oh, no.\n\n01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:57.220\nAnd I'm like, does that mean I can stop going to school?\n\n01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.220\nAnd she goes, yeah.\n\n01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.220\nYeah, she's dying.\n\n01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.220\nSo you stay home from school.\n\n01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.220\nAnd then, and then she like, she nurses Cody through.\n\n01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.220\nShe's like, it's okay.\n\n01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.220\nIt's all right.\n\n01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.220\nIt's going to be okay.\n\n01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.220\nAnd then, and then Cody died.\n\n01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.220\nShe's like, she goes, guess what?\n\n01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.220\nWhat?\n\n01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:16.220\nYou're dead.\n\n01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.220\nAnd then she said, so then Cody's dead.\n\n01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.220\nShe killed Cody.\n\n01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:25.220\nAnd then, and then I was like, wow, do we call a mortician?\n\n01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.220\nOr I don't know what I'm now allowed to.\n\n01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.220\nLike, I don't know.\n\n01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:32.220\nHer parents will be like, you taught her about death.\n\n01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.220\nShe thinks that's sleeping.\n\n01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.220\nI don't, I don't, I don't, now I don't know what I'm like.\n\n01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.220\nAnd then she's like, let's give her some more medicine.\n\n01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:42.220\nAnd she's like, she's like, like, like, there's like, like lotion,\n\n01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.220\nbecause it's a hotel room.\n\n01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:47.220\nIt puts lotion on Cody's forehead that's like medicine for dying.\n\n01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.220\nAnd, and Cody, like blinks her eyes.\n\n01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.220\nIt goes like, I'm alive.\n\n01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.220\nI'm alive.\n\n01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.220\nAnd Maya goes, hey, guess what?\n\n01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.220\nWhat?\n\n01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.220\nYou have to go to school.\n\n01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.220\nYeah.\n\n01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.220\nIt was, it's pretty fun.\n\n01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.220\nI mean, I, sorry.\n\n01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.220\nIs she a good person or a bad person?\n\n01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.220\nI don't, I don't know.\n\n01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:16.220\nI don't, I don't, I don't, I don't actually believe that human beings\n\n01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.220\nhave a moral conscience.\n\n01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:19.220\nI believe that we.\n\n01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:24.220\nWhere in a three year old get like, like the motivation to say you're dying\n\n01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.220\nor you're sick?\n\n01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.220\nLike, did she go through something like recently?\n\n01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.220\nWell, I don't, well, I don't know.\n\n01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:32.220\nI'm not a good enough uncle to know if maybe she lost a goldfish and like,\n\n01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:36.220\nhad a, or, but she, you know, like, like somewhere between all the peppa pigs\n\n01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:40.220\nand the, and the, and the movies that her parents are watching or like all the\n\n01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.220\nother kids in kindergarten or whatever.\n\n01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.220\nIt's like, you know, you're picking up on our mythology, which is about death\n\n01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.220\nand life.\n\n01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.220\nDoes she watch YouTube?\n\n01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.220\nI hope not.\n\n01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.220\nBut, but like, her parents are really good at keeping this.\n\n01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.220\nDid she ever take a turd out and start making a heart on somebody's chest?\n\n01:03:54.220 --> 01:04:01.220\nYou know, but yeah, Sheila, I, I, I, I, I, I, if I was ever going to have a kid,\n\n01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:06.220\nit would only be out of the selfish motivation of like, what a great like audience.\n\n01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.220\nLike there, there's just like your, your bits can be so, you can do such bad.\n\n01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:14.220\nI got a bit that I do with my nephew that I've been doing for about three years now,\n\n01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:18.220\nwhere, whenever I see him, I go, Hey, where's my money?\n\n01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:22.220\nAnd he's like, he's like six.\n\n01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:24.220\nAnd he's like, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:29.220\nAnd I go, no, you said that the last time, where's my money?\n\n01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:32.220\nAnd he's like, I don't have any money.\n\n01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.220\nI go, you better get my money now.\n\n01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.220\nAnd it's parents are just like, I'm so confused.\n\n01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:41.220\nWhat is, is this a joke?\n\n01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.220\nDo you ever say the amount or is it just vague?\n\n01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:47.220\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.220\nI want my money.\n\n01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.220\nWhere's my money?\n\n01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:55.220\nAnd at one time, for some reason, I had like a wad of cash in my wallet.\n\n01:04:55.220 --> 01:05:02.220\nI had 20s and ones and, and I opened it up and I go, Hey, I'm just kidding here.\n\n01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:03.220\nLet me give it.\n\n01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.220\nAnd then I pulled out a receipt and I gave it.\n\n01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:08.220\nHey, can you throw this out for me?\n\n01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.220\nThat's really mean.\n\n01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:13.220\nYeah.\n\n01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.220\nIt's a receipt from Gilson's.\n\n01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.220\nCan you throw this shit out for me?\n\n01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:22.220\nMy nieces and nephews have this game called there's Uncle Brandon.\n\n01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:25.220\nAnd for some reason they played it in front of me.\n\n01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:30.220\nAnd it's whenever they see a black homeless person.\n\n01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.220\nWhat? Somebody tell him.\n\n01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.220\nThank you all so much.\n\n01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.220\nI hope your nieces and nephews are black.\n\n01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.220\nBecause then it helps a little bit.\n\n01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:46.220\nI brought my way into a white family as soon as I got money.\n\n01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:50.220\nAnd do you just think, oh, do you try to educate?\n\n01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:53.220\nI said, who the fuck taught you this game?\n\n01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.220\nYeah.\n\n01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:58.220\nAnd it was my sister.\n\n01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:05.220\nMy fucking sister was like, there's Uncle Brandon out there in LA homeless.\n\n01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:09.220\nOh, she's so provincial and you're Mr. LA.\n\n01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.220\nDon't you always just wear a suit all the time?\n\n01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.220\nYou always look good.\n\n01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:16.220\nYou see a lot of homeless black dudes in blazers.\n\n01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.220\nDon't lie. Don't lie.\n\n01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.220\nYou do.

That's not a clip.\n\n01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:36.220\nThat's a real bow tie.\n\n01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.220\nIt's a real bow tie.\n\n01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:42.220\nOne, you know, Nation of Islam taught me that Allah has many things planned.\n\n01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.220\nRight.\n\n01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:48.220\nYeah, you know how to tie a bow tie and how to make a bean pie?\n\n01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.220\nFinal calls will be passed out throughout the audience.\n\n01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:54.220\nThese people don't know what the fuck the final call is.\n\n01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.220\nBut God love you. Google it.\n\n01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:59.220\nYou guys referenced the five percenters in the...\n\n01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:01.220\nOh, that was me. I brought up the five percenters\n\n01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.220\nand I've been watching the Wu-Tang show on Hulu.\n\n01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.220\nIt's great.\n\n01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.220\nSo I've been thinking about the five percenters.\n\n01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.220\nActually, I think it's really bad, but I like it a lot.\n\n01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.220\nOh, really? You think it's bad?\n\n01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:13.220\nI do. I think, like, you know, I like them.\n\n01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.220\nYeah.\n\n01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:18.220\nSo I like seeing all the fantastical stories that didn't really happen in the projects with them.\n\n01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.220\nYeah.\n\n01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.220\nBut there's a lot of not great acting in it.\n\n01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:24.220\nOh, all right.\n\n01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:26.220\nI thought you'd seen it, right? Try it.\n\n01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:28.220\nI loved it. I thought it was really good.\n\n01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:31.220\nYou were acting like you hadn't seen it, but I thought you recommended it to me.\n\n01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:32.220\nI did recommend it.\n\n01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.220\nIt's good. Do you like them?\n\n01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.220\nI thought it was really...\n\n01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.220\nI know I'm supposed to. I don't...\n\n01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:37.220\nYou don't really?\n\n01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.220\nIf you don't really like them, you might not really like the show.\n\n01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.220\nWell, I don't...\n\n01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.220\nI'm not familiar enough with anybody outside Tori Amos to be like,\n\n01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:45.220\nI like him. I don't like him.\n\n01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.220\nRight.\n\n01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:50.220\nWould you watch a Tori Amos, a part of fictional one-hour drama on Hulu?\n\n01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:52.220\nOh, fuck yeah, he would.\n\n01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:54.220\nWhat would it be called?\n\n01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:59.220\nProbably like cabbages in Turtles Racing or something,\n\n01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.220\nand people would be like, what are you talking about?\n\n01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:04.220\nAnd she'd be like, that's my girls.\n\n01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:05.220\nHey, Spencer.\n\n01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:08.220\nWhat up? Hey, guys.\n\n01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:11.220\nSince we're wrapping up the old Harmontowns,\n\n01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.220\nwe found you in a lucky moment.\n\n01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:18.220\nWhat's your feelings about walking away from this?\n\n01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.220\nI hate it.\n\n01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.220\nYeah?\n\n01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.220\nYeah, I'm sad, you guys.\n\n01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.220\nOh, no.\n\n01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.220\nAre you really?\n\n01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.220\nYou're dying.\n\n01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.220\nOh, no.\n\n01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:31.220\nSee, I think you're being sarcastic.\n\n01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:34.220\nBecause this isn't very different than you sound when you're ecstatic.\n\n01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.220\nNo, I'm sad.\n\n01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:41.220\nI can't tell if you're being for real or you're doing a bit right now.\n\n01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.220\nIt sucks, you guys.\n\n01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.220\nI think he's being for real.\n\n01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.220\nIt's true.\n\n01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:50.220\nI'm being honest.\n\n01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:55.220\nIt feels like only yesterday that you raised your hand when Dan asked,\n\n01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.220\nis anybody here a dungeon master and you raised your hand,\n\n01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.220\nand then here we are after all these years.\n\n01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.220\nIt really does feel like yesterday.\n\n01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.220\nAm I ever going to see you again?\n\n01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.220\nNo.\n\n01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.220\nThis is...\n\n01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.220\nI mean, here's the thing.\n\n01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.220\nIt's like, I don't know if I'm ever going to see any of you guys ever again.\n\n01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:12.220\nI'm going to send you guys like a...\n\n01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:14.220\nThis is my way of hanging out with you.\n\n01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.220\nWell, Spencer and I, we don't have the name of it yet.\n\n01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:21.220\nWe don't know exactly when and where and what, but we have a venue, and Spencer and I...\n\n01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.220\nWe have a venue?\n\n01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:24.220\nWe do have a venue.\n\n01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:26.220\nWhat is it?\n\n01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.220\nI'll drop it.\n\n01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.220\nFollow us, Spencer and I, and somebody else.\n\n01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:34.220\nIt's going to be like, we're going to make a new podcast,\n\n01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.220\nand you guys are all welcome to come to it.\n\n01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:38.220\nOh, shit.\n\n01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:42.220\nWe'll be promoting it at the Mexican place next door,\n\n01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.220\nwhich I hope is not your venue because they're very rarely open.\n\n01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:47.220\nNo, no, it's...\n\n01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:48.220\nIt is odd.\n\n01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.220\nI would have learned their name.\n\n01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:50.220\nIt's a very show-busy place.\n\n01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.220\nIt's going to be groovy.\n\n01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.220\nIt might be monthly.\n\n01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.220\nIt might not be weekly, but we'll make it good, and you guys can all come and...\n\n01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:59.220\nI would like to request that it be all commercials,\n\n01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:03.220\nbecause the thing that I regret most about ending this podcast is the commercials.\n\n01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:06.220\nThat's what I'm going to miss the most is doing ads with Spencer.\n\n01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.220\nIt's the fucking best part of the thing.\n\n01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:11.220\nChurch and Spencer doing the commercials is the fucking greatest thing.\n\n01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:15.220\nIt would be impossible for us to continue to do that in any capacity.\n\n01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.220\nWhat we do have to do, no matter where we go,\n\n01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:20.220\nwe have to steal this desk from a dentistry tapewriter.\n\n01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.220\nThat's fair.\n\n01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.220\nSo you can sit there with your hand on your head.\n\n01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.220\nWhy the hand on the head thing?\n\n01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.220\nWhat's this posture?\n\n01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:29.220\nThe answer to that question, all questions can be revealed...\n\n01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:30.220\nOn the new podcast.\n\n01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.220\nOn the...\n\n01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.220\nNo, I did.\n\n01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:35.220\nI wrote a D&D module, though, that people should...\n\n01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.220\nWhoa!\n\n01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:42.220\nIt's called Color of Chaos, and it's on DMs Guild.\n\n01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:44.220\nWhat if we just call it...\n\n01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.220\nWhat if we just call it Town?\n\n01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.220\nThere's nobody's name involved.\n\n01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:48.220\nIt's just Town.\n\n01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:51.220\nWow, what if we did the thing that I said on air before?\n\n01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:52.220\nYes, exactly.\n\n01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.220\nThat would be a funny joke.\n\n01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.220\nI'm just trying to remind everybody.\n\n01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.220\nNo, I know.\n\n01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.220\nIt's a good thing.\n\n01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.220\nIt's happening already.\n\n01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.220\nAll I'm saying is that buy my module.\n\n01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.220\nBuy your module?\n\n01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:03.220\nGive me money.\n\n01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:06.220\nThat's the only reason I'm here.\n\n01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.220\nI don't care about any of you fucks.\n\n01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.220\nI'm just here for the fucking money.\n\n01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:11.220\nAll right.\n\n01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:13.220\nI want my paycheck, son.\n\n01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.220\nLove an honest man.\n\n01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.220\nGet that money, homie.\n\n01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.220\nThat's what I'm sad about.\n\n01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.220\nAll this fucking money.\n\n01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:21.220\nWhat's up?\n\n01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.220\nWe got Dave Kline over here, everybody.\n\n01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.220\nYou give me a...\n\n01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.220\nWhat up, Dave Kline?\n\n01:11:26.220

final Harmontown.\n\n01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:35.220\nTo a very special sanctum you carved out with your own mitts\n\n01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.220\nwithout any fucking permission.\n\n01:11:37.220 -->

Staten Island.\n\n01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.220\nWhoa.\n\n01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.220\nI wasn't living there.\n\n01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:55.220\nIt was a Manhattan situation at the time.\n\n01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.220\nBut I really did hear Dan and Spencer\n\n01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:03.220\nand Jeff and Schrab and Brandon\n\n01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.220\nand Mike Eagle later

special\n\n01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:15.220\nwhenever you put this on your ear holes.\n\n01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.220\nAnd you could count on a certain amount\n\n01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:21.220\nof

01:13:50.220\nBut if I could, since this is still a podcast,\n\n01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.220\npeople can't really see us, can they?\n\n01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:54.220\nNo.\n\n01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:55.220\nI mean, there's some cameras.\n\n01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.220\nOf course, I saw a ranked doorbell.\n\n01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.220\nThere's cameras everywhere.\n\n01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:59.220\nThere's cameras everywhere.\n\n01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:00.220\nThey're all over.\n\n01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.220\nThis is true.\n\n01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.220\nBut you know

he's very particular about his cut of jeans shorts.\n\n01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.220\nLet's give it up for Arnold, everybody.\n\n01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:43.220\nArnold.\n\n01:14:43.220 -->

tell you guys something really quickly.\n\n01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.220\nThis is Jesse back again.\n\n01:14:58.220 --> 01:14:59.220\nNot Arnold.\n\n01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:00.220\nOh, darn.\n\n01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.220\nWhere's Arnold?\n\n01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:02.220\nJust in case you could tell,\n\n01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.220\neven though I second what Arnold was saying\n\n01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.220\nabout the jeans shorts.\n\n01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.220\nDan in the summertime.\n\n01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:09.220\nI can't tell you how many times I would come

summer shorts.\n\n01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:18.220\nI've been talking about Dan in jeans shorts.\n\n01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.220\nIt's sublime.\n\n01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.220\nI mean, he starts putting them on around May\n\n01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.220\nand well into September.\n\n01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.220\nHe's still wearing jeans shorts.\n\n01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:27.220\nI'm going to miss seeing Dan in jeans shorts.\n\n01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.220\nBut let me just say this really quickly.\n\n01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.220\nI don't want to take up too much time.\n\n01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:34.220\nThis is like the last cheers.\n\n01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:37.220\nThis is already a million times better\n\n01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.220\nthan the last Seinfeld,\n\n01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:40.220\neven though I love Seinfeld.\n\n01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.220\nBut I'm going to say this.\n\n01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.220\nWe're going out with a bang.\n\n01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:46.220\nYou guys, I'm going to tell you the backstage.\n\n01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:48.220\nWe have a musical tribute.\n\n01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.220\nBeck is here.\n\n01:15:50.220 -->

here.\n\n01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.220\nAwesome.\n\n01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.220\nOh, shit.\n\n01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.220\nAlso, Woody Harold and Matthew McConaughey.\n\n01:16:00.220 -->

01:16:08.220\nBut you know, I'm Arnold.\n\n01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:10.220\nI just, you know, I'm into jeans shorts.\n\n01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.220\nSue me.\n\n01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:15.220\nBut

01:16:20.220\nNow that I hijacked this for a minute,\n\n01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:22.220\nI can't let you guys out of here\n\n01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:24.220\nwithout knowing about an amazing project\n\n01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:27.220\nthat Dan is launching in March.\n\n01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.220\nDan has his very own wine.\n\n01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:32.220\nIt's a rosé coming out.\n\n01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:38.220\nIt's called Dan Harmon's third testicle.\n\n01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.220\nNow, this is a wine like no other wine.\n\n01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:45.220\nAnd let me tell you that up in Dan's Napa vineyard,\n\n01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:48.220\nbasically there was a mishap with the grape crusher\n\n01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:53.220\nand some testosterone got mixed in with the wine, so to speak.\n\n01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.220\nJesse, hang on.\n\n01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.220\nSpeaking of wine, Ricardo, you hear where you at, baby?\n\n01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:57.220\nRicardo!\n\n01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.220\nRicardo, you brought wine from your hometown\n\n01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.220\noutside of Florence, Italy, right?\n\n01:17:01.220 -->

01:17:08.220\nRicardo, please come on stage,\n\n01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:13.220\nbecause when he gets up here,\n\n01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:17.220\ngive it up for young Italian Steve Kugen.\n\n01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:19.220\nSteve Kugen!\n\n01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:23.220\nHe looks way too much like Steve Kugen.\n\n01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:25.220\nWhat's up, Ricardo?\n\n01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.220\nWelcome.\n\n01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:27.220\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:29.220\nHere's the wine.\n\n01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:30.220\nLook at this.\n\n01:17:30.220 -->

01:17:37.220\nI think it's just gonna be nice.\n\n01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.220\nI'm gonna take it.\n\n01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.220\nI don't know if it's the best one,\n\n01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.220\nbut it's from my hometown.\n\n01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.220\nItaly?\n\n01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.220\nThe motherfucker looks like Steve Kugen.\n\n01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.220\nLook at

01:17:51.220\nTropic Thunder.\n\n01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:52.220\nTropic Thunder.\n\n01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:53.220\nTropic Thunder.\n\n01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:55.220\nHe looks exactly like Italian Steve Kugen.\n\n01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.220\nSure.\n\n01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.220\nAre there any...\n\n01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:59.220\nThank you, Ricardo.\n\n01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:00.220\nYou're

God.\n\n01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.220\nI forgot how Arnold talked,\n\n01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.220\nbut I think that he's even more handsome\n\n01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.220\nthan an Italian Steve Kugen.\n\n01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.220\nBut I gotta tell you, I mean,\n\n01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:22.220\nthis wine looks magnificent,\n\n01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.220\nand it's got a picture of...\n\n01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.220\nWhat would you describe that?\n\n01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:28.220\nIt looks like a Playboy bunny gone golf.\n\n01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:31.220\nPlayboy bunny gone golf.\n\n01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.220\nThis is amazing wine.\n\n01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:35.220\nRicardo is an amazing man,\n\n01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.220\nand I'm just gonna zip it\n\n01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.220\nbecause everyone on the stage is a legend.\n\n01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:40.220\nWill Brandon.\n\n01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.220\nJeff.\n\n01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:43.220\nRob.\n\n01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.220\nOf course, Rob.\n\n01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.220\nDan.\n\n01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.220\nDan.\n\n01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:47.220\nSpencer.\n\n01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:49.220\nAnd Richard fucking Branson!\n\n01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:50.220\nYeah!\n\n01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:52.220\nRight over there.\n\n01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.220\nRichard shaved for this event,\n\n01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:56.220\nbut fucking no!\n\n01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:58.220\nBut this is...\n\n01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:00.220\nYou thank you, Richard Branson, for being here,\n\n01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.220\nbecause you reminded me of what I wanted to say.\n\n01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.220\nBecause when I think of Richard Branson,\n\n01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.220\nI think about Jeff Bezos,\n\n01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:08.220\nand I'm gonna say this.\n\n01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:11.220\nHere, I think the reason why on Planet Earth right now,\n\n01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.220\nwe have so much bad shit,\n\n01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:15.220\nand I don't even think we would have climate change\n\n01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.220\ndepending on this planet if it weren't for\n\n01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.220\ntiny penis energy.\n\n01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.220\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:22.220\nLet me say this.\n\n01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.220\nIf Jeff Bezos had a big dick,\n\n01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.220\nwould he have to own all that money?\n\n01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.220\nI don't think so.\n\n01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.220\nYou know about...\n\n01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.220\nJesse, Jesse, can I interrupt you?\n\n01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:32.220\nDan Harmon has always had big dick energy.\n\n01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.220\nThe world needs more big dick energy.\n\n01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:38.220\nAnd I am scared that once this podcast ends,\n\n01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.220\nthat we're gonna not have as much big dick energy.\n\n01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.220\nLet's give it up for Arnold, everybody. Arnold!\n\n01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:44.220\nArnold!\n\n01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.220\nBut final thing out of my mouth,\n\n01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:49.220\nI have a feeling this is not\n\n01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.220\nthe last Armored Town ever.\n\n01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:54.220\nShut your ass up while you still talking.\n\n01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:59.220\nPlease use your lips and just start walking.\n\n01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:03.220\nMotherfucker, you got to shut your mouth.\n\n01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.220\nNo, man.\n\n01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.220\nKeep it going, Mike.\n\n01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:13.220\nI would keep singing, but I don't want to do\n\n01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:15.220\nwhat this motherfucker did.\n\n01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:16.220\nNo.\n\n01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:19.220\nAnd take up too much time with that bullshit.\n\n01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.220\nI thought this was just extras\n\n01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.220\nthat this was gonna be edited out.\n\n01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:24.220\nNo, no, it's all good.\n\n01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:26.220\nYou can't edit their lives.\n\n01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.220\nOh, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right,\n\n01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:32.220\nyou're right, you're right, you're right, you're right,\n\n01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.220\nyou're right.\n\n01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.220\nBut no, no, Mike, Mike, let's do a song.\n\n01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.220\nAnd that is why Dan Harmon is Dan Harmon.\n\n01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:39.220\nJesse.\n\n01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.220\nI'm sipping it.\n\n01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:42.220\nYou gave him a mic.\n\n01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:44.220\nWhat did you think was gonna happen?\n\n01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.220\nHe's doing everything that's all good.\n\n01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.220\nEven the microphone.\n\n01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:49.220\nWill you stop talking until that?\n\n01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.220\nYou know, when this show started,\n\n01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:55.220\nI didn't think it would last seven weeks, you know?\n\n01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.220\nLook at us now.\n\n01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:04.220\nDo you remember what the very first Armentone,\n\n01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.220\nlike what you talked about, did you ever,\n\n01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.220\nwhen was the last time you listened to the very first Armentone?\n\n01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:10.220\nWell, I haven't.\n\n01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:14.220\nIt was the promise of going to the moon, wasn't it?\n\n01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:18.220\nBut it started as, we weren't podcasting right away.\n\n01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:21.220\nAnd in my memory, although we tend to conflate these things,\n\n01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:24.220\nbut I believe it was like, we were doing it strictly live,\n\n01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:27.220\nand we were recording them just in case,\n\n01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:32.220\nand kind of off and on, the recording was working and stuff.\n\n01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:36.220\nAnd it was the Chevy Chase thing that kind of like,\n\n01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:40.220\nit was a tipping point because that was a live show\n\n01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:43.220\nthat was not to be, that was not a podcast.\n\n01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.220\nSo we were doing the show for a while.\n\n01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:48.220\nI think that's what Jeff referenced, it was monthly.\n\n01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:51.220\nIt was like, you know, I still had that old school,\n\n01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:55.220\nlike LA kind of perception of like,\n\n01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.220\noh, there's all these shows in LA,\n\n01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:00.220\nwhere you can go see Harry Dean Stanton playing trombone\n\n01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:03.220\nor Jeff Goldblum like, fuck a duck or something,\n\n01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:05.220\nand it's not part of their real lives.\n\n01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.220\nIt's a good show.\n\n01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:08.220\nIt doesn't end up in T.M.P.\n\n01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.220\nNobody played the bone like Harry Dean.\n\n01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:12.220\nBut then I made the awful judgment,\n\n01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:15.220\nthe horrible judgment mistake of playing Chevy's voicemail\n\n01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:17.220\ninto the microphone, and somebody was recording it,\n\n01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:19.220\nand that was part of the decision to be like,\n\n01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:21.220\nokay, let's just start podcasting,\n\n01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:23.220\nbecause if anything, that'll be a shield,\n\n01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:28.220\nbecause if you want things to be out there,\n\n01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:31.220\nthen people start to ignore it more.\n\n01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:35.220\nIt was like, well, there's 5,000 hours of this guy.\n\n01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:41.220\nGet that on the mic, yeah.\n\n01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:42.220\nThere you go.\n\n01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.220\nIt all ended.\n\n01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:49.220\nI was so excited watching Adam Goldberg's face\n\n01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.220\nduring Jesse Camp talking,\n\n01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:54.220\nbecause Adam was like, I fucking did it.\n\n01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:58.220\nI finished first.\n\n01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:00.220\nYeah, I can't remember what the question was,\n\n01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:02.220\nbut it was like, yeah, there was a...\n\n01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:04.220\nI don't remember what the first, it was the whole moon thing.\n\n01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.220\nIt was just the idea of alienation,\n\n01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:09.220\nand nobody told me to tie my shoes and all that stuff,\n\n01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.220\nwhich is like, you know, that's the thing.\n\n01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.220\nIt's like, I don't really feel that way anymore.\n\n01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.220\nI'm not like, hey, leave me alone.\n\n01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:18.220\nDon't tell me what to do.\n\n01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:19.220\nI'm right about everything.\n\n01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:21.220\nEveryone else is wrong kind of guy anymore,\n\n01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:25.220\nand that's become an actual point of view\n\n01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.220\nthat you can't even really defend\n\n01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.220\neven when you do feel that way.\n\n01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:31.220\nIt's not charismatic anymore.\n\n01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:33.220\nAnd I don't always feel that way,\n\n01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:36.220\nbut sometimes I do, and it's just sort of like,\n\n01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:39.220\nI don't want to talk in circles,\n\n01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.220\nbut that's part of the thing is sort of like,\n\n01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:42.220\nwho the fuck am I?\n\n01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:43.220\nIt used to be very simple.\n\n01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:46.220\nIt was like, I'm a baby, you know?\n\n01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:51.220\nI just want to kind of whine and say,\n\n01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.220\nwhat about me?\n\n01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:55.220\nAnd it was therapeutic for me.\n\n01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:59.220\nSo that was the answer to your question.\n\n01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:01.220\nWhen, you know, they always say,\n\n01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.220\nif you keep a journal, don't go back and read your journal.\n\n01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.220\nWhen do you think you'll go back\n\n01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:06.220\nand listen to some of these episodes?\n\n01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:07.220\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:10.220\nI don't know if I ever would, because like,\n\n01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:12.220\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:15.220\nIf Chris McKenna and I get way drunk enough,\n\n01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:17.220\nwe'll like, maybe we'll like,\n\n01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:21.220\nwe'll start watching community episodes.\n\n01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:24.220\nAnd we'll get like halfway through the D&D one,\n\n01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:26.220\nand then we'll pass out.\n\n01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:29.220\nBut it's like, there's something about revisiting stuff\n\n01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:32.220\nthat's like too, like, I don't know.\n\n01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:34.220\nBecause it's like, but you know, it's like,\n\n01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:36.220\nlike, you need to, like...\n\n01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:42.220\nIt's funny that you're holding the wine bottle.\n\n01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:44.220\nWhat?\n\n01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.220\nDrinking wine.\n\n01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:49.220\nWhat? Why no Del Ricardo?\n\n01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.220\nOh, no.\n\n01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:51.220\nThat's not even a, that's like,\n\n01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:54.220\nhe's not even really Italian, is he?\n\n01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:57.220\nWhy no Del Ricardo?\n\n01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:58.220\nThat's Spanish.\n\n01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.220\nAll right.\n\n01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:01.220\nThat's just, that's not what it says.\n\n01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:03.220\nThis labels in Korean.\n\n01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:05.220\nWhen did you like, feel like,\n\n01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:07.220\nwith Harmontown, did you like, go,\n\n01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:09.220\nyes, that was it.\n\n01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:11.220\nThat's the, this is the...\n\n01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:14.220\nDelicious, and I love the Tilda Swinton on the label.\n\n01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:17.220\nIt does feel like a Tilda Swinton.\n\n01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:19.220\nSorry, Rob.\n\n01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.220\nWhen you were, I mean, like it started off with this thing\n\n01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:24.220\nabout we're going to colonize the moon and whatever,\n\n01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:27.220\nbut then eventually I feel like you hit like,\n\n01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:32.220\na stride of, this is what a typical Harmontown is,\n\n01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:36.220\nwas it when you were at Meltdown,\n\n01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:38.220\nwas it at the castle, was it here,\n\n01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:42.220\nwhen did you feel like, oh, okay, this is working,\n\n01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:43.220\nthis is the pattern?\n\n01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:45.220\nI don't know, I never really felt that way.\n\n01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.220\nI don't know, I guess early on at Meltdown\n\n01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:50.220\nI felt like there was a groovy thing going\n\n01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:53.220\nthat kind of made a little bit of sense.\n\n01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:56.220\nAnd I think that after Meltdown closed,\n\n01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:59.220\na lot of us in the comedy community,\n\n01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:02.220\nlame thing, comedy community,\n\n01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:06.220\nbut a lot of LA comedy people that had performed at Meltdown\n\n01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:09.220\nall of a sudden realized as one does,\n\n01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:15.220\nthat how much of the show was that venue.\n\n01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:20.220\nThat Harmontown was kind of sort of inextricably defined\n\n01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:24.220\nby the wooden pillars in the room and this,\n\n01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:27.220\nand back in those days I was always like,\n\n01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.220\nGod damn it, if we could just get rid of these pillars\n\n01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:31.220\nand make this room five times bigger,\n\n01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.220\nwe could put cameras everywhere,\n\n01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.220\nand then I could show slides of my dog,\n\n01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.220\nalways like driven by this thing.\n\n01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:41.220\nThere was never a full embrace of the podcast of it all.\n\n01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:44.220\nIt was just a show that became a podcast.\n\n01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:47.220\nAnd then the other funny transformation that happened\n\n01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:50.220\nis it's so weird to remember this because I can't,\n\n01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.220\nit's sort of like the way I remember sometimes\n\n01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:54.220\nI smoked a pack and a half a day,\n\n01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.220\nand then I'm like, because someone will say,\n\n01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.220\ndo you mind if I smoke in here?\n\n01:26:58.220 --> 01:26:59.220\nAnd I'll be like, yeah, I don't care.\n\n01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:02.220\nAnd I'm like, holy shit, I smoked like a chimney.\n\n01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:05.220\nI can't believe this, but like originally\n\n01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.220\nwhen we were recording the episodes,\n\n01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:11.220\nI would sit with Feral Audio founder Dustin Marshall\n\n01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:13.220\nand we would like, I would go over to his house,\n\n01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:16.220\nI would book sessions that would last like three or four hours\n\n01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:18.220\nwhere we'd go through the entire recording\n\n01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:23.220\nand edit the ums and us out, basically.\n\n01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:25.220\nLike I was like, oh, no one wants to listen to somebody\n\n01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:28.220\nlike Stammer and Stutter and say the same thing\n\n01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.220\nover and over again.\n\n01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:30.220\nWhen did you stop doing that?\n\n01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:33.220\nI don't remember, we just got exhausted.\n\n01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:34.220\nSo I remember, yeah, you do it.\n\n01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:37.220\nAnd I can totally relate because I would be like,\n\n01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.220\nI would want to do that too.\n\n01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.220\nIt wasn't like you let go.\n\n01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:44.220\nI assure you, that's so strange to think about\n\n01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.220\nbecause I'm the laziest guy in the world\n\n01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:48.220\nand also the most narcissistic.\n\n01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:52.220\nI'd be like, yeah, listen to me, figure it out, whatever.\n\n01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:57.220\nBut at the time, it was like, oh, that's what you're supposed to do.\n\n01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:59.220\nYou recorded it live, it's sloppy,\n\n01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:01.220\nclean it up, or don't put it in people's ears,\n\n01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:04.220\nyou terrible person, be responsible.\n\n01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:07.220\nAnd I'm sure there was just this point where it was like,\n\n01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:09.220\nwell, if I have to keep doing that,\n\n01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:12.220\nthen I have to stop doing the show because it's too much work.\n\n01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:16.220\nIt's like the amount of time I need to spend on actual shit.\n\n01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:19.220\nBut it's just so funny that I would go through the show\n\n01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:22.220\nand go like, oh, I'm being kind of redundant there.\n\n01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:23.220\nYeah.\n\n01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:25.220\nLook, what was the goal?\n\n01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:27.220\nIt's such a weird...\n\n01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:29.220\nIt's crazy to look back,\n\n01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:32.220\nbecause we just do this kind of silly thing,\n\n01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.220\nwe just come here, we don't talk about it.\n\n01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.220\nThe first few episodes, I think, Dan,\n\n01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:39.220\nyou and I, we'd have kind of a plan,\n\n01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:41.220\nlike a trajectory that we're going to do,\n\n01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:43.220\nand then we gave that up pretty quickly.\n\n01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:46.220\nBut then Robin Williams was on the show.\n\n01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:49.220\nAnd we wrote a song with Eric Idle,\n\n01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:52.220\nand he sang it, like some pretty crazy stuff has happened.\n\n01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:56.220\nAnd it really has just been this lazy thing,\n\n01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:59.220\nbut it makes me very happy\n\n01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:03.220\nand kind of confused that everybody likes it so much.\n\n01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:06.220\nI really want to thank everybody who's listening\n\n01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.220\nor who's here tonight, who traveled.\n\n01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:11.220\nIt's pretty crazy.\n\n01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:14.220\nIt's kind of emotional that you guys all dug it so much.\n\n01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:17.220\nI can definitely explain the...\n\n01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:29.220\nI definitely understand as a podcast listener,\n\n01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:32.220\nbut it's kind of worth noting that the word podcast\n\n01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.220\nis something that in eight years, it's like a new word,\n\n01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:37.220\nand that at the beginning of these eight years,\n\n01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:39.220\nthis decade that we've just been through,\n\n01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:42.220\nI remember being in Erin McGathy's car\n\n01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:47.220\nand her iPod playing.\n\n01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:50.220\nThis guy started talking about how he and Natasha\n\n01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:52.220\nhad just broken up,\n\n01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:56.220\nbut the podcast was going to continue to be what it was,\n\n01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:58.220\nand, hey, breakups just happened, man.\n\n01:29:58.220 --> 01:29:59.220\nThat's all.\n\n01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:01.220\nIt's just, look, man, things just happened.\n\n01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:03.220\nAnd I'm like, after like 10 minutes\n\n01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:05.220\nof just listening to this guy talk,\n\n01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:08.220\nI was like, what the fuck is this?\n\n01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:10.220\nIt's not a book on tape or radio.\n\n01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:12.220\nSo what is this?\n\n01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:14.220\nAnd she's like, oh, it's Duncan Trussell.\n\n01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:18.220\nAnd he had just broken up with Natasha Ligiero.\n\n01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:20.220\nThey were doing a podcast together for a while,\n\n01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:25.220\nand then he was explaining what was really going on\n\n01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:28.220\nin his life, which he would later do\n\n01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:31.220\nas he got diagnosed with cancer, as his mother died.\n\n01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:34.220\nAnd Duncan was also, I believe, the first podcast\n\n01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:37.220\nI was ever on as a guest.\n\n01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:41.220\nAnd I really want to give him a big, big shout out,\n\n01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:43.220\nbecause...\n\n01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:47.220\nAlso, while you're on that, Dan,\n\n01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:51.220\nEmily Gordon, she's the one that made this happen.\n\n01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:53.220\nEmily needs to be...\n\n01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:59.220\nShe told Dan to have a podcast at Nerd Mountain Meltdown.\n\n01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.220\nThat's why this all started.\n\n01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:02.220\nYeah.\n\n01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:06.220\nBut also like Adam Goldberg and Anatoly and Dave Kline\n\n01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:10.220\nand Vega and all the people that we've met\n\n01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:13.220\nthat have come up throughout the years.\n\n01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:16.220\nAnd also, I would never have met Spencer Crittenden\n\n01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:18.220\nwithout this show.\n\n01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:19.220\nYeah.\n\n01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:22.220\nThank you to me.\n\n01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:25.220\nAnd Chris and Sarah.\n\n01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:27.220\nChris and Sarah.\n\n01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.220\nI'm going to forget a million names of people\n\n01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:32.220\nthat we've just kind of pulled out of the crowd\n\n01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.220\nback in the days when we just say,\n\n01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:36.220\nlike, anybody want to come up and talk?\n\n01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:41.220\nAnd we've met a lot of beautiful, wonderful people.\n\n01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:43.220\nI'm going to get sad.\n\n01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:45.220\nUh...\n\n01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:49.220\nBefore you get sad,\n\n01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:53.220\nI'm just going to shout out a couple people.\n\n01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:54.220\nOh, shit.\n\n01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:58.220\nNot your comedically long list of weird names.\n\n01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:00.220\nArnold.\n\n01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:05.220\nHa, ha, ha, ha.\n\n01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:08.220\nShout out to Splendid

01:36:21.220\nInto a diaper in San Francisco.\n\n01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:24.220\nDan Ward depends and peed into his depends.\n\n01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:30.220\nIt was like 40 minutes before the show and Dan decided, what if I pissed live on stage?\n\n01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:31.220\nWell, that's come on.\n\n01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:32.220\nThat's not how my thought process was.\n\n01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:34.220\nI believe that's exactly what happened.\n\n01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:38.220\nThere was a shit story earlier with another person you admire.\n\n01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:39.220\nWe're at exactly.\n\n01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:41.220\nI always approach it with a new one.\n\n01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.220\nYou peed and you were so happy about it, you were really stoked.\n\n01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:46.220\nYou're like, oh shit, I can just pee wherever I go now.\n\n01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:52.220\nIt started as this because somebody had mentioned the people in Times Square when they wear diapers for years.\n\n01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:54.220\nAnd I was like, come on.\n\n01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.220\nThat's just peeing in your pants.\n\n01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:59.220\nI was like, I want to know what these diapers are like.\n\n01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:00.220\nYeah, we're in Pesuvio, right?\n\n01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:01.220\nIncredible.\n\n01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:03.220\nYou're peeing into a portal.\n\n01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:06.220\nIt's a whole ass mood.\n\n01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:15.220\nSo I had to run and find a place that had the nicest, best looking adult diapers for Dan to wear on stage.\n\n01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:18.220\nNot because I insisted on anything other than adult diapers.\n\n01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:22.220\nApparently you just want me to look good while I'm peeing myself.\n\n01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:23.220\nNo, no.\n\n01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:26.220\nYou don't want the 8K diaper, which is lame.\n\n01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:28.220\nBut you peed and the look.\n\n01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:31.220\n8K, I was like 8K diaper.\n\n01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:33.220\nOh, 8K.\n\n01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:38.220\nThe look on your face while you're peeing, you were so happy.\n\n01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:43.220\nYou look so completely like, oh, I can just pee in front of people.\n\n01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:50.220\nBaby boomers are the first modern generation to get that age where they need diapers.\n\n01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:57.220\nAnd so of course the diapers are now, they look like, and the technology behind them.\n\n01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:06.220\nSo we have them to thank for our nation's opioid addiction and the pills and the diapers are fucking NASA level.\n\n01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:13.220\nBecause the people that invented the Beatles are shitting themselves and are in fucking pain.\n\n01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.220\nI can't wait to get old.\n\n01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:17.220\nDurr.\n\n01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:19.220\nI can't wait to piss just like hanging out.\n\n01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:21.220\nHow was it pissing on your pants?\n\n01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:22.220\nIt was incredible.\n\n01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:23.220\nWas it?\n\n01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:28.220\nYes, because think about everything you do when you pee.\n\n01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:30.220\nMen are always kind of like...\n\n01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:31.220\nCry?\n\n01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:33.220\nWe kind of like...\n\n01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:37.220\nYou know, we flaunt with women.\n\n01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:40.220\nIt's like, oh, we're just like...\n\n01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.220\nIt's no problem. You just whip it out.\n\n01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:45.220\nI'm out of the bus driver again.\n\n01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:47.220\nYou whip it out.\n\n01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:54.220\nThey just like whatever and they got a squat and it's more of an ordeal for them to pee into a bush or whatever.\n\n01:38:54.220 --> 01:39:02.220\nYou have no idea how high maintenance what we have to do is until you experience just standing in your pants\n\n01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:05.220\nand doing whatever you want.\n\n01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:07.220\nYou can play a video game.\n\n01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:09.220\nYou can talk to people and just pee.\n\n01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:11.220\nHave you ever worn these ever again?\n\n01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:12.220\nNo.\n\n01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.220\nYou don't have to.\n\n01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.220\nI left the stage a second ago to pee. I do wish I could have stayed.\n\n01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:20.220\nIt's truly like...\n\n01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:23.220\nWe've all peed in the shower so you have this experience of like there's water all over you.\n\n01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:25.220\nI have never peed in the shower.\n\n01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:27.220\nWhoa.\n\n01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:29.220\nSorry.\n\n01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:31.220\nWe're telling truths up here.\n\n01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:34.220\nThis from the guy who doesn't like...\n\n01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:36.220\nYou've never peed in the shower?\n\n01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:37.220\nI've never peed in the shower.\n\n01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:38.220\nBecause you're a gentleman?\n\n01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:41.220\nBecause the toilet's right there.\n\n01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:44.220\nBut peeing in the shower is like...\n\n01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:45.220\nFrom the shower?\n\n01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:46.220\nThat's your birthright.\n\n01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:52.220\nThere's never been a time, I guess, when I didn't realize I had to pee until I was in the middle of the shower.\n\n01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:55.220\nBut don't you get in the shower and you've got the warm water rolling over you?\n\n01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:57.220\nThat doesn't make me have to pee.\n\n01:39:57.220 --> 01:39:59.220\nIt makes me have to pee.\n\n01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:00.220\nOkay, well that's just me then.\n\n01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:02.220\nDo women pee in the shower?\n\n01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:04.220\nYes.\n\n01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:06.220\nThat was nearly unanimous.\n\n01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:11.220\nI think they kind of live for it, honestly, which is why men are usually not afraid to admit it\n\n01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:14.220\nbecause we've never been shamed by women for peeing in the shower.\n\n01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:18.220\nBecause women are like the Christopher Columbus of peeing in the shower.\n\n01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:21.220\nWomen buy either...\n\n01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:23.220\nBecause it's dark out there, buy applause.\n\n01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:26.220\nWhat women has never peed in the shower?\n\n01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:29.220\nYeah, give it up a few.\n\n01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:31.220\nNow, can I ask one of you why?\n\n01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:35.220\nJust because you never had to or you think it's rude?\n\n01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:37.220\nIt's dirty.\n\n01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:39.220\nBut you're in the shower?\n\n01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:41.220\nI think it's gross.\n\n01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:43.220\nIt's probably going to be the answer.\n\n01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:46.220\nI don't think people that have never peed in the shower are monsters.\n\n01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:47.220\nI don't.\n\n01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:49.220\nNo, no, I'm just saying.\n\n01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:50.220\nI'm not even against it.\n\n01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:52.220\nI just think they never did it.\n\n01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:54.220\nYou should try it sometime.\n\n01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.220\nMaybe tomorrow. Who knows?\n\n01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:59.220\nThe night is young, baby.\n\n01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.220\nHey, everybody.\n\n01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:03.220\nUh-oh.\n\n01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:05.220\nThrow a beat down, Zach.\n\n01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:07.220\nThrow a beat down, Zach.\n\n01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:09.220\nIt's a peon song.\n\n01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:11.220\nPut a beat on before you get peed on.\n\n01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:14.220\nOkay, well, it's me, MC Gun Control.\n\n01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.220\nOh, shit.\n\n01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:18.220\nOh, damn.\n\n01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:19.220\nMC.\n\n01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:21.220\nGive it up for MC Gun Control.\n\n01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:25.220\nI can't believe we're here at the final episode of Harmontown.\n\n01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:30.220\nA platform I have used to spread my ambiguous message\n\n01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:33.220\nabout gun violence.\n\n01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:36.220\nMy name, as you know, is MC Gun Control,\n\n01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:43.220\nand the bit is you can't tell if I'm for or against it.\n\n01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:46.220\nBut there's also a part of an added meta bit\n\n01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:50.220\nabout how forthright I am about that being my bit,\n\n01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:54.220\nwhich I personally enjoy.\n\n01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:58.220\nBut here's a little rap about gun control,\n\n01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:01.220\nwhich is also my name.\n\n01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:10.220\nThe AK-47 is capable of killing 30,000 lives a second.\n\n01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:17.220\nIt's the most devastating weapon ever available in stores.\n\n01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:19.220\nYeah!\n\n01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:25.220\nOver 50 million handguns are in the houses.\n\n01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:28.220\nThey're very, very popular.\n\n01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:30.220\nHandguns are popular.\n\n01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.220\nThe most popular.\n\n01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:35.220\nEven more than blenders.\n\n01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:39.220\nI'm MC Gun Control.\n\n01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:46.220\nBullets are lethal.\n\n01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:49.220\nBullets are lethal.\n\n01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:53.220\nMore lethal than icicles.\n\n01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:58.220\nEven if they don't go through your eyeballs,\n\n01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:02.220\nwhich icicles have to do to be lethal.\n\n01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:06.220\nIf you throw an icicle at a human,\n\n01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:08.220\nthey'll get mad at you.\n\n01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:10.220\nThey'll know what you are.\n\n01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:17.220\nThey'll know you are far into the realm of enmity.\n\n01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.220\nWith them, they'll be like,\n\n01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:23.220\nhey, why'd you throw an icicle at me?\n\n01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:27.220\nThey'll also probably think you'd just throw an icicle at them,\n\n01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:32.220\nbecause the icicle will have broken up in the air.\n\n01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:36.220\nBy the time it hits them, it'll be cubes.\n\n01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:41.220\nThey'll think you'd just throw an icicle at them in winter.\n\n01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:44.220\nGuns, on the other hand,\n\n01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:51.220\ncan kill people regardless of the season or the intention.\n\n01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:53.220\nMC Gun Control.\n\n01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:55.220\nYes, thank you.\n\n01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:56.220\nI'm MC Gun Control.\n\n01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:59.220\nYou know MC Gun Control.\n\n01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:04.220\nDid you know guns are responsible for more deaths than cancer, Jeff?\n\n01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.220\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:06.220\nMike, you got to be...\n\n01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:07.220\nYou're looking at your thing.\n\n01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:09.220\nThat was his beat.\n\n01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:10.220\nThat was yours.\n\n01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:12.220\nEverything was all my fault, basically.\n\n01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:15.220\nLet's do one more, then.\n\n01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:17.220\nOh, shit.\n\n01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:23.220\nHey, I'm MC N209.\n\n01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:26.220\nAnd I'm not feeling fine.\n\n01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:29.220\nYou got 10 seconds to comply.\n\n01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:31.220\nWith my rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm.\n\n01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:32.220\n10.\n\n01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.220\nYo, it's old Detroit.\n\n01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:36.220\nIt's got a cancer called crime.\n\n01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.220\nThat ain't no joint.\n\n01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.220\nSick.\n\n01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:41.220\nYo, I'm the next step in law enforcement.\n\n01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:44.220\nPut your mother so hard, her pussy is engorgent.\n\n01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:45.220\nTwo.\n\n01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:50.220\nOne.\n\n01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:57.220\nSometimes I speak like I should experience after to make a word rhyme.\n\n01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:04.220\nHer pussy was engorgent.\n\n01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:06.220\nRower.\n\n01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:09.220\nI can't walk downstairs.\n\n01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.220\nI roar like a lion.\n\n01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:14.220\nI'm stopped motion animated, but I ain't crying.\n\n01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:16.220\nYou can't see genie.\n\n01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:20.220\nThat won't be reality because you need the texture to make you feel humanity.\n\n01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:23.220\nComing through the animation, giving it character.\n\n01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:30.220\nFuck your mama so hard, I needed an airplane hanger to hold all the chairs.\n\n01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:32.220\nCause that's how fucking is.\n\n01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:35.220\nWhen you're in 209, you do that shit right.\n\n01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:38.220\nYou never leave a single pussy hanging tight.\n\n01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:39.220\nYou lose it.\n\n01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:40.220\nOkay.\n\n01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:41.220\nYou lose it.\n\n01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:42.220\nOkay.\n\n01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:43.220\nThere it is.\n\n01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:44.220\nYeah.\n\n01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:48.220\nWow.\n\n01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:53.220\nWe really heard from all of the old beloved characters.\n\n01:45:53.220 --> 01:46:00.220\nIf I was a reporter from Vulture doing a retrospective on our podcast, I would be extra impressed at this point.\n\n01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:05.220\nAnd I'm sure that article is going to turn out great.\n\n01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:08.220\nBut did I mention this already?\n\n01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.220\nPaste magazine, I think it was.\n\n01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:13.220\nWhy do they still call them magazines?\n\n01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:18.220\nThey said we were, you know, one of the best podcasts of the decade.\n\n01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:22.220\nI think you're kind of cheating when your podcast lasts a decade.\n\n01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:25.220\nI mean, it's like a weird thing for a podcast to be so old.\n\n01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:26.220\nSo we were in there.\n\n01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:28.220\nWhat are we up there with?\n\n01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:30.220\nWhat are we up there with?\n\n01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:31.220\nI didn't read the article.\n\n01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:33.220\nProbably Splendid Table.\n\n01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.220\nI think number one was...\n\n01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:37.220\nI'm going to read the Vulture one, though.\n\n01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:39.220\nThis American Life is number one, I think.\n\n01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:40.220\nFuck that.\n\n01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.220\nWell, whatever.\n\n01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:46.220\nYou know, that's because I had an episode on there.\n\n01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:47.220\nWow.\n\n01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:48.220\nGoddamn it.\n\n01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.220\nWay to make it about you.\n\n01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:51.220\nWay to make it about you.\n\n01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:52.220\nChrist.\n\n01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:53.220\nDan, what's next for you?\n\n01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:55.220\nI always knew I'd end up on this American Life.\n\n01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:57.220\nDo you want to do another podcast ever again, Dan?\n\n01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:58.220\nIs this it for you?\n\n01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:01.220\nAre you just going to fuck off straight and do the night?\n\n01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:06.220\nNo, I think that, honestly, it's not a fun answer,\n\n01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:10.220\nbut no, I can't wait to do more stuff.\n\n01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:16.220\nI just think that I'm just tired of acting like I'm a product.\n\n01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:22.220\nSo I think that that was a fun surfing style for a while,\n\n01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:25.220\nand it doesn't make as much sense anymore.\n\n01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:28.220\nAnd everybody matures at different rates,\n\n01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:31.220\nand it's like a bingo card, like you knock out shit\n\n01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:32.220\nat different times.\n\n01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:35.220\nSome people are prodigies at shit, and then absolute morons\n\n01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:37.220\nand other stuff until they're 70.\n\n01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:42.220\nI've never done actual just like, hey, I think I'm going to try to be funny\n\n01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:46.220\nand do a performance and try to make people laugh kind of thing.\n\n01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:50.220\nI've always fallen back on the, hey, look at who I am.\n\n01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.220\nA lot of great people have done that.\n\n01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:57.220\nHoward Stern and the like, we love that.\n\n01:47:57.220 --> 01:48:01.220\nIt's a heavy tradition of like, that's the old white guy going like,\n\n01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.220\nhey, look at me, I'm sucking my thumb.\n\n01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:08.220\nBut I'm bored with that and feel like also,\n\n01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:11.220\nI would have to double down so much.\n\n01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:12.220\nI have a question.\n\n01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:15.220\nCan somebody run for mayor of Harmontown?\n\n01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:17.220\nCan somebody run for mayor of Harmontown?\n\n01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:18.220\nA special election?\n\n01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.220\nOh, shit.\n\n01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:25.220\nI declare my candidacy a fucking Harmontown.\n\n01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:28.220\nYes.\n\n01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:31.220\nMy first act is mayor of Harmontown to change the name.\n\n01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:33.220\nI second that emotion.\n\n01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:37.220\nWhat if, yeah, what if I can just, Mike Eagle just becomes mayor of Harmontown.\n\n01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:39.220\nEagletown.\n\n01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:41.220\nSchrab.\n\n01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:43.220\nSchrab.\n\n01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:46.220\nI can make some shit about me for seven years.\n\n01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:51.220\nAs this town's Obama, I obviously cannot make an endorsement at this stage.\n\n01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:53.220\nIt would be catastrophic.\n\n01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:57.220\nThis town's Obama.\n\n01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:00.220\nGive me a beat.\n\n01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:03.220\nThis town's Obama.\n\n01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:04.220\nOkay.\n\n01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:05.220\nGo do it.\n\n01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.220\nThis town's Obama.\n\n01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:12.220\nNever gonna fuck a mama.\n\n01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:14.220\nYo, every town's got a zone Obama.\n\n01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:16.220\nObama.\n\n01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:17.220\nChicago.\n\n01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:18.220\nObama.\n\n01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:19.220\nObama.\n\n01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.220\nYeah.\n\n01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.220\nNew Orleans.\n\n01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:23.220\nObama.\n\n01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:25.220\nNot Obama.\n\n01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:27.220\nNo.\n\n01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:28.220\nObama.\n\n01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.220\nWe can go out and out.\n\n01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:33.220\nJust listen to cities.\n\n01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:39.220\nIt either is or it isn't Obama.\n\n01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:41.220\nCutta hay, Wisconsin.\n\n01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:42.220\nNot Obama.\n\n01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:45.220\nIt's a different Obama.\n\n01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:48.220\nEvery town's got an Obama, y'all.\n\n01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:49.220\nIt's not the same.\n\n01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:52.220\nLike my sweaters made of lava, yo.\n\n01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:53.220\nYo.\n\n01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:56.220\nI made my sentences with commas, so.\n\n01:49:56.220 --> 01:49:59.220\nObama.\n\n01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:02.220\nObama.\n\n01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:05.220\nEverybody gotta be their own Obama.\n\n01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:08.220\nBe yourself's own Obama.\n\n01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:12.220\nHope and change on the open range.\n\n01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:14.220\nFuck your mama so hard.\n\n01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:17.220\nHer labia hang.\n\n01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:19.220\nCome on, I gotta stop.\n\n01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:21.220\nMike, I'm so sorry.\n\n01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:22.220\nNo, I know.\n\n01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:23.220\nLook, look.\n\n01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:25.220\nHey, hey.\n\n01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:27.220\nI was playing along earlier, right?\n\n01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:29.220\nBut I heard the reports.\n\n01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:31.220\nI heard what happened after.\n\n01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:33.220\nI know what happened.\n\n01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:36.220\nAnd also we recorded a whole album together.\n\n01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:40.220\nWe had to make the whole album about fucking mamas.\n\n01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:41.220\nIt is a tic.\n\n01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:43.220\nIt's a rap tic.\n\n01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:47.220\nAnd it's like, isn't it weird how you would, it's like,\n\n01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:52.220\nit's not a rap tic that saves you in really any way.\n\n01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:55.220\nIt saves you, though, because you use it.\n\n01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:56.220\nYou know all these rhymes.\n\n01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:59.220\nWell, it's like you, yeah, it's sort of like,\n\n01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:02.220\nit's a tic during the setup of a rhyme, though.\n\n01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:04.220\nOr, no, I guess it's not, actually.\n\n01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:06.220\nIt's okay, it's in the, because you go like,\n\n01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:08.220\noh, I went to the store and I bought some milk.\n\n01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:11.220\nThen you can go, fuck your mama so hard,\n\n01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:13.220\nbecause, well, you're thinking of the word silk.\n\n01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:14.220\nYes.\n\n01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:15.220\nBut then you say the silk,\n\n01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:17.220\nand then you start rhyming about the silk.\n\n01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:18.220\nRight.\n\n01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:21.220\nSo you actually use it, which makes it usable.\n\n01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:23.220\nWe might have talked about this before,\n\n01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:26.220\nbut when you're writing, are you just freestyling\n\n01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:28.220\nand putting it on pen and paper?\n\n01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:30.220\nNo, I'm writing.\n\n01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:31.220\nSo it's all written.\n\n01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:33.220\nI'm making choices.\n\n01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:35.220\nYeah.\n\n01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:39.220\nBut the writing process, you're still,\n\n01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:41.220\nlike, obviously, while you're making stuff up\n\n01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:43.220\nand putting it on the paper, like, you're still,\n\n01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:46.220\nthere's a freestyle, you're selecting choices\n\n01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:49.220\nout of the freestyles that are coming out of your head.\n\n01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:50.220\nSure.\n\n01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:51.220\nYeah.\n\n01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:52.220\nBut then you make the choices and you go,\n\n01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:53.220\nokay, that's the one I'm using.\n\n01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:55.220\nLike, this is the best option.\n\n01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:56.220\nRight.\n\n01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:57.220\nI'll write that one down.\n\n01:51:57.220 --> 01:51:58.220\nYeah.\n\n01:51:58.220 --> 01:51:59.220\nThat's an interesting idea.\n\n01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:01.220\nYou make a choice and you go,\n\n01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:03.220\nI'm going to make the best choice.\n\n01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:04.220\nA good one.\n\n01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:05.220\nYeah, do the good thing.\n\n01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:07.220\nYou know, like most writers.\n\n01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:08.220\nRight.\n\n01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:11.220\nBut somebody about, in England,\n\n01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:14.220\nwhen whose lens anyway was on the air in England,\n\n01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:16.220\na hilarious review said,\n\n01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:19.220\nwhy not prepare something funny?\n\n01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:24.220\nWhy not improvise?\n\n01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:29.220\nI'm going to read something.\n\n01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:30.220\nA lot of people, you know,\n\n01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:32.220\nwe have a history on this show of, like,\n\n01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:35.220\nwe, you know, people who put themselves out there\n\n01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:38.220\nand demand their time around the skillet, you know.\n\n01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:41.220\nBut I thought this was a,\n\n01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:44.220\nthis isn't going to blow anyone's mind,\n\n01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:45.220\nbut I thought it was like,\n\n01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:47.220\nthis is sort of the every man kind of thing.\n\n01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:51.220\nI got this, I got handed this note and I won't keep,\n\n01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:53.220\nI'll just get through it.\n\n01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:56.220\nBut that's not something to get through.\n\n01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:58.220\nIn a way.\n\n01:52:58.220 --> 01:52:59.220\nDear Dan, if you're reading this,\n\n01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:02.220\nit means that at some point I was able to intercept you\n\n01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:03.220\nand hand this to you.\n\n01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:04.220\nThat's not true.\n\n01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:07.220\nI was given to it by a subordinate.\n\n01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:10.220\nIt's brand done.\n\n01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:13.220\nSubordinate.\n\n01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:16.220\nWell, there are channels and it got to me.\n\n01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:18.220\nAnd that's the importance of, you know, boundaries.\n\n01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:19.220\nWho gave it to you?\n\n01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:21.220\nI don't even remember.\n\n01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:22.220\nIt was me.\n\n01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:23.220\nSomeone, I, someone I,\n\n01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:27.220\nsomeone I pay someone else to remember their name.\n\n01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:31.220\nKeisha, Keisha, who, who was it?\n\n01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:32.220\nThey handed it to me.\n\n01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:33.220\nSteve.\n\n01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:34.220\nKeisha.\n\n01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:36.220\nWhy did your voice overlap with mine?\n\n01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:37.220\nNever mind.\n\n01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:38.220\nAll right.\n\n01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:39.220\nKeisha.\n\n01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:40.220\nKeisha.\n\n01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:41.220\nYeah.\n\n01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.220\nYou know what?\n\n01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:43.220\nYeah.\n\n01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:44.220\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:45.220\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:46.220\nNo, I know.\n\n01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:47.220\nI don't accept.\n\n01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:51.220\nMy diversity program can't be fictional.\n\n01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:53.220\nIt doesn't help.\n\n01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:54.220\nIf Demorge was here,\n\n01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:58.220\nthe three of us would have whooped your way.\n\n01:53:58.220 --> 01:53:59.220\nSuch a stereo.\n\n01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:00.220\nShout out to Demorge.\n\n01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:01.220\nDemorge.\n\n01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.220\nDemorge.\n\n01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:05.220\nDoes he know the show is ending?\n\n01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:06.220\nYeah.\n\n01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:07.220\nHe knows.\n\n01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:08.220\nOkay.\n\n01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:09.220\nKeisha.\n\n01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:10.220\nWow.\n\n01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:11.220\nThe nerve.\n\n01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:12.220\nYeah.\n\n01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:13.220\nAll right.\n\n01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:14.220\nThe nerve.\n\n01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:15.220\nIn which case,\n\n01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:16.220\nthank you for taking it and reading it.\n\n01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:17.220\nAlso,\n\n01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:19.220\nthank you for not socially rejecting me when I spoke to you\n\n01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:20.220\nbriefly at the drawing room,\n\n01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:23.220\nwhich would have haunted me forever in parentheses\n\n01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:26.220\nand how you so generously and thoroughly answered my\n\n01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:28.220\nquestion about characterization.\n\n01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:30.220\nI've got pretty bad social anxiety.\n\n01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:32.220\nI feel lonely and ashamed a lot,\n\n01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:34.220\nbut I'm learning to accept myself better.\n\n01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:36.220\nI've got a neurodiverse family.\n\n01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:38.220\nI'm learning to accept them better too.\n\n01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:41.220\nHearing about your complex relationships with people\n\n01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:43.220\nand writing has really helped me.\n\n01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:47.220\nHarmontown is so much more than 360 episodes of the best\n\n01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:49.220\npodcast ever made.\n\n01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:53.220\nI heard someone say no.\n\n01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:55.220\nSomeone, no.\n\n01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:57.220\nIt's not more than that.\n\n01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:58.220\nThat's all it is.\n\n01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:02.220\nListen to American life.\n\n01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:05.220\nThe day I came across your Story Structure 101 post\n\n01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:07.220\nwas the day I also discovered Joseph Campbell\n\n01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:08.220\nin Harmontown.\n\n01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:10.220\nIt was also the day I figured out how to end a story.\n\n01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:11.220\nI was writing,\n\n01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:12.220\nwhich was the first story I got published.\n\n01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:15.220\nNow I see this as that Campbellian thing where\n\n01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:17.220\nif it's meant to be your adventure,\n\n01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:18.220\nthe world will open.\n\n01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:20.220\nI will miss your dialogue on growth,\n\n01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:21.220\ntruth, and happiness.\n\n01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:24.220\nI will miss the podcast like I am losing a very good friend.\n\n01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:25.220\nThank you for everything,\n\n01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:27.220\nalthough I am sure you'll continue to inspire\n\n01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:30.220\nyour moonbound, neurodiverse band of Harmonians\n\n01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:32.220\njust in different ways.\n\n01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:35.220\nKristen, I'll just use her first name.\n\n01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:37.220\nThank you, Kristen.\n\n01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:39.220\nThat was really good.\n\n01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:42.220\nAlso, I don't know if it's the same Kristen,\n\n01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:44.220\nbut another Kristen gave me an awesome gift\n\n01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:46.220\nof a bunch of little notebooks like this.\n\n01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:48.220\nSo thank you, Kristen, for that.\n\n01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:51.220\nIt better not be like a letter that's identical to that,\n\n01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:53.220\nexcept it's like...\n\n01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:55.220\nI don't want to get corny,\n\n01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:57.220\nbut I really can't say...\n\n01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:59.220\nThe only thing that I'll take away from this...\n\n01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:01.220\nWhat's it been? Seven, eight years?\n\n01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:02.220\nHow long have we been doing this?\n\n01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:05.220\nBy the way, I just want to say one thing.\n\n01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:08.220\nIn 360 episodes,\n\n01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:14.220\nI have gotten many, many letters pressed into my hand.\n\n01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:16.220\nSo if you're out there and you're thinking,\n\n01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:18.220\nI wrote this motherfucker,\n\n01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:20.220\nmy dog died, and I don't know...\n\n01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:26.220\nI've read 87% to 89% of the letters\n\n01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:29.220\nthat you've handed me in the back alley\n\n01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.220\nor the out front and stuff,\n\n01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:33.220\nand they're all always great.\n\n01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:35.220\nI read that one.\n\n01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:37.220\nIt got handed to me tonight.\n\n01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:39.220\nThat one represents all of your letters.\n\n01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:41.220\nI think that's always been so special about it.\n\n01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:43.220\nEverybody that knows that we hang out in the drawing room,\n\n01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:45.220\nyou guys have come out and said hello,\n\n01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:47.220\nand usually in a very shy way.\n\n01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:49.220\nI have a question about that.\n\n01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:52.220\nY'all tell people on the show\n\n01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:54.220\nthat y'all hang out at the drawing room?\n\n01:56:54.220 --> 01:56:56.220\nWe mentioned it, yeah, really.\n\n01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:58.220\nIn the very beginning.\n\n01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.220\nI've seen you there.\n\n01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:02.220\nYeah, but I'm glad to know that now,\n\n01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:05.220\nbecause I won't feel safe there anymore.\n\n01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:08.220\nY'all let everybody know that that's where you hang out.\n\n01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:10.220\nIt's been so cool throughout the years\n\n01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:12.220\nof meeting you all,\n\n01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:14.220\nall these faces in the crowd\n\n01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:16.220\nand people listening.\n\n01:57:16.220 --> 01:57:18.220\nIt's been really cool just to...\n\n01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:20.220\nI don't know why it means that much to you,\n\n01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:22.220\nbut it means a lot to me\n\n01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:24.220\nthat you guys are all so sweet.\n\n01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:26.220\nOh, that's the thing I was going to try.\n\n01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:28.220\nIt means a lot to you because of...\n\n01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:40.220\nThat is the most Harmontown thing\n\n01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:42.220\nI could have possibly had.\n\n01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:44.220\nIt means a lot to them because of the time spent.\n\n01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:46.220\nThat's both the thing.\n\n01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:49.220\nThere's no way to deflect it because it's just time spent.\n\n01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:51.220\nI mean, you...\n\n01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:53.220\nThat's why when somebody says,\n\n01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:55.220\nHoly shit, your podcast means so much,\n\n01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:58.220\nthat means they've put in the time.\n\n01:57:58.220 --> 01:58:01.220\nIt's like they've done as much work as we have.\n\n01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:04.220\nThere are people that only listen to a dozen episodes,\n\n01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:07.220\nthere's people that have gone and listened to the entire thing\n\n01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:09.220\nfrom the very beginning.\n\n01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:13.220\nThe fact that Grey Worm from Game of Thrones likes it,\n\n01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:15.220\nthe fact that Rob Corddry likes it,\n\n01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:17.220\nthe fact that people that I've met\n\n01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:21.220\nthat live in Europe and South America and shit,\n\n01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:26.220\nthe fact that it means something to listen to,\n\n01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:28.220\nI guess, neurodiversity\n\n01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:31.220\nand our weird ramblings,\n\n01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:33.220\nthat it's really crazy to me.\n\n01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:36.220\nI will say to everybody that listens to this one,\n\n01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:38.220\nthank you.\n\n01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:42.220\nYeah.\n\n01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:46.220\nYeah, we got as much out of it as you did, believe me.\n\n01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:49.220\nI didn't think we'd last seven weeks.\n\n01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:54.220\nI can't believe it.\n\n01:58:59.220 --> 01:59:02.220\nA birthday...\n\n01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:05.220\nAll right, Dan, we're getting close to closing time,\n\n01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:07.220\nbut I think it's time for you two to re-init.\n\n01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:09.220\nYeah, we're well past it, but...\n\n01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:12.220\nBut I'm gonna put it on you right now.\n\n01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:15.220\nSay goodbye to Hamilton.\n\n01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:17.220\nThank you, Jeff.\n\n01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:20.220\nI started here...\n\n01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:25.220\nHow can I?\n\n01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:28.220\nThe year was 2012.\n\n01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:35.220\nRob,\n\n01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:37.220\ncan we all give it up for...\n\n01:59:37.220 --> 01:59:40.220\nI think the most joyful part of Hamilton Town,\n\n01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:42.220\nin my experience, has been Rob Schrab,\n\n01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:44.220\nwho contributed.\n\n01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:46.220\nOh, man.\n\n01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:48.220\nThank you, Jeff.\n\n01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:52.220\nI don't get it.\n\n01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:55.220\nI don't get it.\n\n01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:57.220\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.220\nYeah, you see it.\n\n02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:07.220\nIf you're listening, there's people walking out.\n\n02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:10.220\nPeople are...\n\n02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:13.220\nPeople are stapling themselves to their chairs\n\n02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:16.220\nin what I can only describe as a reverse ovation.\n\n02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:23.220\nRob Schrab.\n\n02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:25.220\nI don't know what to say.\n\n02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:29.220\nI really don't know what to say about any of that.\n\n02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:32.220\nYou're in the middle of a very complicated racial orio.\n\n02:00:32.220 --> 02:00:34.220\nThere's a lot of pressure on you.\n\n02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:36.220\nIt's an inverted, yeah.\n\n02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:38.220\nWell, I don't know.\n\n02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:41.220\nAbout a year or two years ago,\n\n02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:44.220\nI was going through a pretty dark time.\n\n02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:47.220\nAnd that's when I started coming to the show regularly,\n\n02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:52.220\nand it really, really helped me get back on my feet,\n\n02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:54.220\nyou know, like, just mentally.\n\n02:00:54.220 --> 02:00:56.220\nI'll take it from here.\n\n02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:59.220\nYeah, please. I'm about to drop it.\n\n02:00:59.220 --> 02:01:02.220\nBut it just made me feel less alone,\n\n02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:05.220\nand, you know, I was just...\n\n02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:09.220\nYeah, I just hit a deep, deep valley creatively,\n\n02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:12.220\nand just...\n\n02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:14.220\nI don't know, and just being here,\n\n02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:16.220\nand, you know, it was really...\n\n02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:20.220\nI mean, it was how I got to hang out with my friends,\n\n02:01:20.220 --> 02:01:27.220\nand just getting a lot of love online was very, very sweet.\n\n02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:30.220\nIt was very sweet.\n\n02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:34.220\nAnd I don't really...\n\n02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:38.220\nIt's not hitting me how much I'm going to miss it yet.\n\n02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:42.220\nYou know, like, right now, all I'm thinking of, like,\n\n02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:44.220\nmy knees are so fucking cold right now,\n\n02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:46.220\nbecause it's just, like, freezing.\n\n02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:49.220\nIt's freezing. It's freezing up here.\n\n02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:51.220\nWhy just your knees? What's...\n\n02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:54.220\nI don't know. Like, this area, like, is right here.\n\n02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:56.220\nAre your knees cold?
