don't wanna maintain that show biz thing,\n\n01:40.060 --> 01:42.540\nwhere you're like, wow, did they just appear on stage?\n\n01:42.540 --> 01:46.900\nNo, I know who's here, and I just talked to him,\n\n01:46.900 --> 01:49.460\nbut I haven't seen him since I was on his podcast,\n\n01:49.460 --> 01:50.940\nand it was a delightful chat.\n\n01:50.940 --> 01:54.380\nI, we'll talk more about that later.\n\n01:54.380 --> 01:56.620\nWhat do I have to talk about?\n\n01:56.620 --> 02:01.620\nI, okay, so, all right, I'm not gonna play\n\n02:03.140 --> 02:04.520\nNo Man's Sky anymore.\n\n02:06.020 --> 02:06.860\nYay.\n\n02:08.220 --> 02:09.940\nI'm back at the modded Minecraft,\n\n02:09.940 --> 02:14.940\nand I accidentally one-click ordered a new gaming laptop,\n\n02:21.660 --> 02:26.540\nand it runs great.\n\n02:26.540 --> 02:28.020\nI love it.\n\n02:28.020 --> 02:29.900\nI'm saying all these things with a lot of shame,\n\n02:29.900 --> 02:33.380\nbecause I'm like, I don't know how to be happy.\n\n02:33.380 --> 02:35.820\nI was in my car this morning,\n\n02:35.820 --> 02:39.060\nand I was like, I was going through the audio books,\n\n02:39.060 --> 02:44.060\nand I was like, I wanna listen to a book\n\n02:44.060 --> 02:46.820\nabout what I'm going through.\n\n02:46.820 --> 02:49.100\nI was like, what am I going through?\n\n02:49.100 --> 02:51.540\nWhat would your therapist say?\n\n02:51.540 --> 02:52.900\nCoping with happiness.\n\n02:52.900 --> 02:55.980\nWell, so it wasn't a big surprise\n\n02:55.980 --> 02:58.980\nthat that's not like a big book-selling market.\n\n02:58.980 --> 03:01.460\nThere's nothing, there's nothing.\n\n03:01.460 --> 03:02.900\nSo you're coping with happiness,\n\n03:02.900 --> 03:04.660\nthere's nothing, and you type happiness,\n\n03:04.660 --> 03:07.500\nand then you get a couple hits that are like,\n\n03:07.500 --> 03:09.220\nthe advantage of happiness.\n\n03:09.220 --> 03:12.460\nWhy happiness is better than what you're going through?\n\n03:13.740 --> 03:15.660\nHow to get happiness and all this stuff,\n\n03:15.660 --> 03:18.800\nand I'm like, well, none of these things are really for me.\n\n03:18.800 --> 03:23.400\nI did, I did, I did, I got one that was like,\n\n03:23.400 --> 03:25.680\nthe happiness advantage,\n\n03:25.680 --> 03:27.800\nbecause it's like, if a guy's talking about,\n\n03:27.800 --> 03:29.400\noh, it's good to be happy,\n\n03:29.400 --> 03:33.160\nthen that's pretty close to saying, oh, you're happy,\n\n03:33.160 --> 03:34.720\nhere's how you deal with it.\n\n03:36.560 --> 03:39.360\nBut it's not, because I stopped,\n\n03:39.360 --> 03:42.280\nI paid 20 bucks for it, and then the guy was like,\n\n03:42.280 --> 03:47.280\nI'm gonna tell you how happiness is better than you think.\n\n03:47.280 --> 03:50.520\nEveryone thinks that if you succeed,\n\n03:50.520 --> 03:51.760\nthen you'll be happy.\n\n03:51.760 --> 03:53.120\nFirst of all, that's not at all,\n\n03:53.120 --> 03:55.400\nI don't buy into that.\n\n03:56.960 --> 03:59.440\nIt happens to be true in my case,\n\n03:59.440 --> 04:03.200\nbut I didn't, it was my path to happiness,\n\n04:03.200 --> 04:05.440\nbut I realized that that path is not,\n\n04:05.440 --> 04:09.720\nso I'm like, okay, I succeeded, so I'm happy,\n\n04:09.720 --> 04:13.000\nand then all the happiness books are like,\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.640\nwhat's with this success thing?\n\n04:14.640 --> 04:16.220\nAnd I'm like, well, everything.\n\n04:16.220 --> 04:19.360\nSo I can't hear the, but then I think about,\n\n04:19.360 --> 04:20.760\nso then the guy's like,\n\n04:20.760 --> 04:22.880\nI'm gonna tell you how it's good to be happy.\n\n04:22.880 --> 04:26.520\nChapter one, I applied for Harvard on a dare,\n\n04:26.520 --> 04:27.800\nand I'm like, what the, what?\n\n04:27.800 --> 04:31.120\nThat's literally how the book starts,\n\n04:31.120 --> 04:33.320\nthat's the only thing I have to talk about.\n\n04:33.320 --> 04:36.200\nI applied to Harvard on a dare,\n\n04:36.200 --> 04:37.440\nhow do you, don't you know people\n\n04:37.440 --> 04:39.240\nare gonna be listening to your book?\n\n04:40.840 --> 04:42.600\nThey paid $20 for it.\n\n04:42.600 --> 04:46.480\nNo one that went to Harvard under any circumstances\n\n04:47.360 --> 04:50.160\npaid $20 for a book on happiness.\n\n04:50.160 --> 04:52.440\nLike most of the people had $40,\n\n04:52.440 --> 04:53.920\nand were like, I'll take half of this,\n\n04:53.920 --> 04:56.080\nand I'm gonna fucking let it roll.\n\n04:56.080 --> 04:58.200\nLike, let's try it.\n\n04:58.200 --> 04:59.360\nSomething's gotta give,\n\n04:59.360 --> 05:02.360\nlike maybe the reason why this $40 isn't $80\n\n05:02.360 --> 05:03.880\nis because I haven't spent $20.\n\n05:03.880 --> 05:07.360\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year.\n\n05:07.360 --> 05:08.520\nSteve brought that out.\n\n05:08.520 --> 05:10.080\nAll right.\n\n05:10.080 --> 05:13.080\nI got one, I got one, you guys.\n\n05:13.080 --> 05:14.360\nI've been railing about,\n\n05:14.360 --> 05:17.280\nyou know about this war on Christmas.\n\n05:17.280 --> 05:19.200\nLike, we talk about it a lot on here.\n\n05:19.200 --> 05:20.600\nI think last week or something,\n\n05:20.600 --> 05:24.560\nI was talking about what the Reese's Cups has been doing.\n\n05:24.560 --> 05:25.480\nOh, right, right, right.\n\n05:25.480 --> 05:28.560\nBut what about these, the newest salvo\n\n05:28.560 --> 05:33.560\nin the war on Christmas is these new holiday-colored soda cans.\n\n05:34.600 --> 05:35.960\nThey got green ribbons on them.\n\n05:35.960 --> 05:38.040\nThe coax, they don't taste right\n\n05:38.040 --> 05:40.800\nbecause they have a war on Christmas.\n\n05:40.800 --> 05:41.640\nOh.\n\n05:41.640 --> 05:43.640\nThey make them taste worse than normal Coke\n\n05:43.640 --> 05:46.280\nto make people hate Christmas.\n\n05:46.280 --> 05:48.520\nAnd then they put a green ribbon on it.\n\n05:49.920 --> 05:50.760\nThat's all.\n\n05:52.360 --> 05:55.320\nOkay, who's Troll Air Dropping, man?\n\n05:55.320 --> 05:56.640\nOh, no.\n\n05:57.880 --> 05:59.520\nOh, boy.\n\n05:59.520 --> 06:00.520\nThis is a new thing.\n\n06:00.520 --> 06:02.240\nWhat's your, what's your name, sir?\n\n06:03.400 --> 06:06.280\nI'm like Atticus Finch, who are you?\n\n06:06.280 --> 06:08.680\nJebediah, you're better than this.\n\n06:11.440 --> 06:13.080\nI actually, I kind of like that.\n\n06:13.080 --> 06:16.400\nIt's like the whole world is now a 70s single bar.\n\n06:16.400 --> 06:18.920\nLike, we're like a Laverne shirt.\n\n06:18.920 --> 06:20.720\nYou guys don't know anything I'm talking about.\n\n06:20.720 --> 06:23.360\nBut there would be like phones on the tables.\n\n06:23.360 --> 06:26.360\nLike the single scene would be like, hey, good looking.\n\n06:26.360 --> 06:29.920\nI was on a plane and somebody started air dropping me.\n\n06:29.920 --> 06:32.200\nCause yeah, you, okay, so you saw my phone\n\n06:32.200 --> 06:33.400\nand what's it called?\n\n06:33.400 --> 06:37.520\nWell, the name is not a famous person's iPhone.\n\n06:38.520 --> 06:39.360\nNice.\n\n06:39.360 --> 06:42.600\nWait, wait, wait, Dan, Dan, Dan, let me hit pause here.\n\n06:42.600 --> 06:45.920\nYou can be on a plane and someone can find your phone.\n\n06:45.920 --> 06:47.960\nIf my Bluetooth is on, you can change your settings\n\n06:47.960 --> 06:48.800\nto not available.\n\n06:48.800 --> 06:51.120\nAnd the air drop, like they interrupt what you're hearing\n\n06:51.120 --> 06:52.960\nor they just see it come up and go,\n\n06:52.960 --> 06:54.720\noh, so-and-so wants you to hear.\n\n06:54.720 --> 06:56.400\nMaybe not what you're hearing, no.\n\n06:56.400 --> 06:59.000\nIt sends you a notification that there's a picture\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:00.680\nor something like a photo.\n\n07:00.680 --> 07:02.200\nOh, I see, I got you.\n\n07:02.200 --> 07:05.000\nI thought they were like gonna play you some music\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:05.840\nor some shit.\n\n07:05.840 --> 07:06.680\nNo.\n\n07:06.680 --> 07:09.040\nI mean, this would be, you can see how if you did this\n\n07:09.040 --> 07:11.920\nwhile I was in my house, that would be a federal,\n\n07:13.120 --> 07:15.520\nbecause it's just a photo of me.\n\n07:15.520 --> 07:18.400\nWhen you're at a show, it's fun,\n\n07:18.400 --> 07:20.760\nbut this is exactly what rapists do.\n\n07:24.640 --> 07:26.320\n10 times before they,\n\n07:28.960 --> 07:30.760\nbefore they take it to the next level.\n\n07:30.760 --> 07:33.520\nIt's because it's a photo of me.\n\n07:33.520 --> 07:34.920\nAm I driver's license is probably in it?\n\n07:34.920 --> 07:38.280\nNo, but yeah, I do, I like it.\n\n07:38.280 --> 07:40.760\nBut I remember I was on a plane\n\n07:40.760 --> 07:43.400\nand somebody started sending me shit\n\n07:43.400 --> 07:44.720\nand it was like random shit.\n\n07:44.720 --> 07:46.800\nAnd then I started, I was sending him random shit.\n\n07:46.800 --> 07:49.840\nI project this gender onto a person\n\n07:49.840 --> 07:53.560\nwho would fucking push their way into your phone.\n\n07:55.200 --> 07:57.160\nI feel like if I had a guess\n\n07:57.160 --> 07:59.720\nthat it's like a dude on the plane,\n\n07:59.720 --> 08:03.320\nand I started, I don't know if that's a thing\n\n08:03.320 --> 08:07.480\nwhere people have photo wars in random places.\n\n08:07.480 --> 08:09.760\nDo people do that just to random strangers?\n\n08:09.760 --> 08:11.680\nDo you guys just send?\n\n08:11.680 --> 08:12.960\nAlways, yeah.\n\n08:12.960 --> 08:14.760\nIn the Starbucks.\n\n08:14.760 --> 08:16.880\nWhat are you, I wanna ask you so many questions,\n\n08:16.880 --> 08:20.880\nbut then you're not mic'd and there's 50 of you, so.\n\n08:20.880 --> 08:21.760\nIt wouldn't make any sense.\n\n08:21.760 --> 08:23.560\nThank you for that photo of me.\n\n08:23.560 --> 08:24.400\nAbed.\n\n08:24.400 --> 08:27.000\nOh, I declined it, I declined it on accident.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.720\nIt's a habit, because I didn't wanna commit.\n\n08:32.720 --> 08:34.520\nI should've saved it, it's a good photo.\n\n08:34.520 --> 08:35.560\nI look very handsome.\n\n08:35.560 --> 08:38.280\nAbed texted me a couple months ago\n\n08:38.280 --> 08:40.560\nand he's like, these kids, I'm at this subway\n\n08:40.560 --> 08:43.480\nand these kids keep airdropping me, these naked pictures.\n\n08:43.480 --> 08:47.200\nI think they're trying to get me in trouble with the police.\n\n08:47.200 --> 08:48.600\nAnd I was like, that sucks, man.\n\n08:48.600 --> 08:50.800\nI don't know if they're trying to call the police.\n\n08:50.800 --> 08:53.520\nThe person on the airplane that they kept airdropping,\n\n08:53.520 --> 08:54.680\nthey were like memes.\n\n08:54.680 --> 08:57.800\nThey were like pictures of African-American people\n\n08:57.800 --> 08:59.920\nlooking horrible.\n\n08:59.920 --> 09:00.920\nYeah, racist memes.\n\n09:00.920 --> 09:04.640\nThey were like memes about Daylight Savings Time\n\n09:04.640 --> 09:05.640\nthat I couldn't even tell.\n\n09:05.640 --> 09:07.840\nI was like, I'm not on Twitter anymore,\n\n09:07.840 --> 09:10.400\nso I don't know if it was Daylight Savings Time,\n\n09:10.400 --> 09:13.200\nlike a slam on liberals.\n\n09:13.200 --> 09:15.880\nDid we vote against Daylight Savings Time?\n\n09:15.880 --> 09:17.040\nThat sounds right.\n\n09:17.040 --> 09:20.240\nI know, it was like random

13:47.120\nWell, I'm sorry, but people keep getting angry for no reason\n\n13:47.120 --> 13:50.120\nand then breaking character.\n\n13:50.120 --> 13:52.120\nWell, stop it.\n\n13:52.120 --> 13:58.120\nI'm just showing you how you do a windmill.\n\n13:58.120 --> 13:59.120\nThis is my area.\n\n13:59.120 --> 14:01.120\nIt's where I keep the gum.\n\n14:01.120 --> 14:03.120\nI would like two

feces.\n\n14:26.120 --> 14:30.120\nI made them both.\n\n14:30.120 --> 14:35.120\nEach of them has a story.\n\n14:35.120 --> 14:40.120\nHowever, each of them will frighten.\n\n14:40.120 --> 14:41.120\nI'm sorry.\n\n14:41.120 --> 14:44.120\nEach little piece of poop you gave me has a story.\n\n14:44.120 --> 14:45.120\nYes.\n\n14:45.120 --> 14:47.120\nAnd one of them scary.\n\n14:47.120 --> 14:50.120\nBoth are scary.\n\n14:50.120 --> 14:53.120\nTidal wave story.\n\n14:53.120 --> 14:54.120\nNo, that's the...\n\n14:54.120 --> 14:55.120\nOkay.\n\n14:55.120 --> 14:56.120\nOkay.\n\n14:56.120 --> 14:57.120\nWell, I...\n\n14:57.120 --> 14:58.120\nI think we're done.\n\n14:58.120 --> 14:59.120\nOkay.\n\n14:59.120 --> 15:00.120\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n15:00.120 --> 15:01.120\nWe'll do more later.\n\n15:01.120 --> 15:02.120\nThat was a great...\n\n15:02.120 --> 15:05.120\nThat's where the training really...\n\n15:05.120 --> 15:07.120\nYou're like, yeah, you know what?\n\n15:07.120 --> 15:09.120\nWhat they would like is to stop doing this,\n\n15:09.120 --> 15:12.120\nand that's the actual instinct.\n\n15:12.120 --> 15:14.120\nWell, yeah, self-editing.\n\n15:14.120 --> 15:15.120\nYeah.\n\n15:15.120 --> 15:17.120\nI thought maybe you would run across.\n\n15:17.120 --> 15:21.120\nI tried to, but then I had the mic cord issues.\n\n15:21.120 --> 15:22.120\nYeah, no, the mic cord was difficult.\n\n15:22.120 --> 15:25.120\nThat's why improvisers don't tend to use them.\n\n15:25.120 --> 15:28.120\nYeah, but if we did it without microphones right now,\n\n15:28.120 --> 15:31.120\nI think our podcast would suffer, or would it?\n\n15:31.120 --> 15:33.120\nIf we did the show without mics?\n\n15:33.120 --> 15:35.120\nI like when things on podcasts happen,\n\n15:35.120 --> 15:37.120\nor it's like, why are you out?\n\n15:37.120 --> 15:39.120\nThere's a moment.\n\n15:39.120 --> 15:41.120\nWell, just for a moment, yeah.\n\n15:41.120 --> 15:42.120\nThere's a moment.\n\n15:42.120 --> 15:44.120\nLike when a stand-up is like,\n\n15:44.120 --> 15:46.120\nand then my drunk aunt comes over,\n\n15:46.120 --> 15:48.120\nand she's like, what the god damn it?\n\n15:48.120 --> 15:49.120\nYeah.\n\n15:49.120 --> 15:53.120\nAnd you associate distant sound with loudness.\n\n15:53.120 --> 15:55.120\nYeah, distant sound with loudness.\n\n15:55.120 --> 15:57.120\nBecause otherwise the alternative is...\n\n15:57.120 --> 15:58.120\nHow about this, how about this?\n\n15:58.120 --> 16:00.120\nGive me two mics.\n\n16:00.120 --> 16:02.120\nI want an area mic, you guys.\n\n16:02.120 --> 16:04.120\nPut your mic down.\n\n16:04.120 --> 16:06.120\nI would just do one.\n\n16:06.120 --> 16:08.120\nI have an

sorry.\n\n16:19.120 --> 16:22.120\nBecause he doesn't know what that means, Pete.\n\n16:22.120 --> 16:25.120\nPete, you are a UCB trained improviser.\n\n16:25.120 --> 16:27.120\nThis guy doesn't know shit.\n\n16:27.120 --> 16:29.120\nYeah, come on.\n\n16:29.120 --> 16:31.120\nI see you is what I'm saying.\n\n16:31.120 --> 16:32.120\nDo we do...\n\n16:32.120 --> 16:33.120\nArea.\n\n16:33.120 -->

to take part in this too.\n\n18:31.920 --> 18:33.760\nYeah, no, no, I'm just a therapist.\n\n18:33.760 --> 18:36.160\nI'm not also the guy that owns the gum store.\n\n18:36.160 --> 18:40.600\nNo, I can say if it's up to me, which it shouldn't be.\n\n18:40.600 --> 18:41.800\nIt's up to you.\n\n18:41.800 --> 18:46.200\nBut my opinion is that you're not, that you're a different character.\n\n18:46.200 --> 18:47.040\nI'm a different guy.\n\n18:47.040 --> 18:49.360\nThat's why I made a white bee gesture.\n\n18:49.360 --> 18:52.000\nYeah, that's, and I have a beard of bees.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.400\nOh, shit.\n\n18:54.400 --> 18:54.880\nWow.\n\n18:58.640 --> 19:01.400\nI hope you're not allergic.\n\n19:01.400 --> 19:04.760\nNo, I mean, we had this conversation\n\n19:04.760 --> 19:06.400\nwhen I agreed to go with you.\n\n19:06.400 --> 19:07.680\nBe my patient, yeah.\n\n19:07.680 --> 19:13.000\nBut did you know I also have pubes of bees?\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.120\nI always wondered.\n\n19:16.120 --> 19:18.200\nAnd that's how I got me three.\n\n19:24.920 --> 19:28.640\nI got me three showing my beard of bees pubes to you.\n\n19:28.640 --> 19:32.640\nNow we know it works without mics too, yeah.\n\n19:32.640 --> 19:33.160\nWhat do you think?\n\n19:33.160 --> 19:34.640\nWhat do you think it works?\n\n19:34.640 --> 19:38.120\nLike, in a totally grounded, like, your actual speculation\n\n19:38.120 --> 19:41.360\nof in a world where the hashtag me three existed,\n\n19:41.360 --> 19:47.560\nit would be actually like, what would the me three movement be?\n\n19:47.560 --> 19:48.680\nYeah, me three.\n\n19:48.680 --> 19:50.720\nI don't like people when people call, you know,\n\n19:50.720 --> 19:52.160\nthere's number one.\n\n19:52.160 --> 19:53.360\nLike, I go number one.\n\n19:53.360 --> 19:54.040\nRight.\n\n19:54.040 --> 19:54.920\nAnd that's a pee pee.\n\n19:54.920 --> 19:56.320\nRight.\n\n19:56.320 --> 19:59.200\nAnd then I'm explaining this in case there's someone\n\n19:59.200 --> 20:00.080\nfrom Lithuania.\n\n20:00.080 --> 20:00.560\nYeah.\n\n20:00.560 --> 20:05.440\nI know it's a very different system in Lithuania.\n\n20:05.440 --> 20:10.480\nIt's like, it must be nice to have numbers for a waste.\n\n20:10.480 --> 20:13.000\nWe go in and whatever happens, happens.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:17.240\nSometimes number two is part P.\n\n20:17.240 --> 20:19.520\nBut a number two is a poo poo.\n\n20:19.520 --> 20:20.880\nEveryone knows this.\n\n20:20.880 --> 20:23.680\nBut then some people get cued with it and they say,\n\n20:23.680 --> 20:26.360\nI just did a number three, which means they did a poo poo\n\n20:26.360 --> 20:27.440\nand a pee pee.\n\n20:27.440 --> 20:29.280\nBut who is doing a poo poo without a pee pee?\n\n20:29.280 --> 20:29.680\nRight.\n\n20:29.680 --> 20:31.160\nThat was an emergency poo poo.\n\n20:31.160 --> 20:32.840\nWell, when we were kids, we would have that.\n\n20:32.840 --> 20:33.800\nWhat's a number three?\n\n20:33.800 --> 20:36.360\nIt would be like, oh, is that puke, burps?\n\n20:36.360 --> 20:37.400\nYeah.\n\n20:37.400 --> 20:39.520\nMilk coming out of a booby?\n\n20:39.520 --> 20:40.160\nYeah.\n\n20:40.160 --> 20:42.760\nThat's a number seven.\n\n20:42.760 --> 20:44.320\nWell, let me ask you this.\n\n20:44.320 --> 20:45.920\nIs it about my lactation?\n\n20:45.920 --> 20:47.600\nBecause I told you not to bring that up.\n\n20:47.600 --> 20:50.320\nIt involves it.\n\n20:50.320 --> 20:56.400\nIf you push the button and then you pull the chain,\n\n20:56.400 --> 20:59.760\nout comes chocolate choo-choo train?\n\n20:59.760 --> 21:01.880\nObjection, leading the witness.\n\n21:01.880 --> 21:02.600\nYeah, exactly.\n\n21:02.600 --> 21:04.640\nJeff, please.\n\n21:04.640 --> 21:05.800\nWe're talking about lactation.\n\n21:05.800 --> 21:08.440\nHe's talking about milk, milk, lemonade.\n\n21:08.440 --> 21:08.720\nRight.\n\n21:08.720 --> 21:10.800\nSo where is your fudge made?\n\n21:10.800 --> 21:11.800\nRound the back.\n\n21:11.800 --> 21:13.800\nOh, OK.\n\n21:13.800 --> 21:15.320\nDoesn't that throw off the meter?\n\n21:15.320 --> 21:16.960\nShouldn't it be around the corner?\n\n21:16.960 --> 21:18.000\nI say around the back.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:18.600\nReally?\n\n21:18.600 --> 21:19.000\nYeah.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nMilk, milk, lemonade, round the back.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.480\nFudges made?\n\n21:22.480 --> 21:22.960\nCorner?\n\n21:22.960 --> 21:24.040\nWhat are you, a sex pistol?\n\n21:24.040 --> 21:25.280\nCorner?\n\n21:25.280 --> 21:26.040\nRound the corner.\n\n21:26.040 --> 21:28.240\nAngles on my hips?\n\n21:28.240 --> 21:29.720\nIt's round the back.\n\n21:29.720 --> 21:32.560\nMilk, milk, lemonade, round the corner.\n\n21:32.560 --> 21:33.480\nFudge is made.\n\n21:33.480 --> 21:34.720\nIt's ionic pentameter.\n\n21:34.720 --> 21:36.240\nMilk, lemonade, round the back.\n\n21:36.240 --> 21:36.840\nRound the back.\n\n21:36.840 --> 21:37.920\nFudge is made.\n\n21:37.920 --> 21:40.000\nIt's like your cockney.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:40.920\nRound the back.\n\n21:40.920 --> 21:42.520\nFudge is made.\n\n21:42.520 --> 21:44.120\nI'm going to fucking slam you with the.\n\n21:44.120 --> 21:45.080\nIt's like a cockney.\n\n21:45.080 --> 21:47.760\nIt's not a civilized expression.\n\n21:47.760 --> 21:49.240\nIt's a working class.\n\n21:49.240 --> 21:50.360\nIt's a cockney that brings up the back.\n\n21:50.360 --> 21:51.560\nBiological education.\n\n21:51.560 --> 21:53.280\nThat's where you get the fudge.\n\n21:53.280 --> 21:54.360\nIt's the first draft.\n\n21:54.360 --> 21:56.520\nBy the way, welcome to the show, and do you want to talk\n\n21:56.520 --> 21:58.880\nabout who are you and what are you?\n\n21:58.880 --> 21:59.440\nWho are you?\n\n21:59.440 --> 22:02.920\nWell, I'm a cockney, Rhimes Smith.\n\n22:02.920 --> 22:06.040\nAnd, well, I'm Pete.\n\n22:06.040 --> 22:06.960\nI'm Pete Holmes.\n\n22:06.960 --> 22:10.480\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n22:10.480 --> 22:14.080\nHe has a podcast that I was on.\n\n22:14.080 --> 22:16.520\nYou were on a wonderful episode called You Made It Weird.\n\n22:16.520 --> 22:23.160\nI told you backstage that my therapist who is known to my\n\n22:23.160 --> 22:24.840\naudience.\n\n22:24.840 --> 22:26.040\nFear to be his callback.\n\n22:26.040 --> 22:29.600\nLike, my therapist doesn't acknowledge, like, she's like,\n\n22:29.600 --> 22:31.240\nshe uses family guy references.\n\n22:31.240 --> 22:33.480\nAnd then I'm like, you know, I have a cartoon\n\n22:33.480 --> 22:35.080\nthat you could reference.\n\n22:35.080 --> 22:38.880\nAnd she's like, yeah, I tried to watch, you know.\n\n22:38.880 --> 22:42.840\nI've come to realize that she's maybe not negging me,\n\n22:42.840 --> 22:46.640\nbut is like that she understands that if she ever\n\n22:46.640 --> 22:50.920\ndid cross that threshold that it would lower my opinion of her\n\n22:50.920 --> 22:53.160\nas far as a person who's under my hood.\n\n22:53.160 --> 22:53.800\nI see.\n\n22:53.800 --> 22:55.000\nWhich makes sense to me.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:55.440\nI get it.\n\n22:55.440 --> 22:56.200\nLet's talk about that.\n\n22:56.200 --> 22:59.320\nWait, because you're big into all spiritual,\n\n22:59.320 --> 23:01.000\nmental, physical well-being.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.160\nYeah, sure.\n\n23:02.160 --> 23:03.800\nAre you?\n\n23:03.800 --> 23:05.400\nThat was the best heckle?\n\n23:05.400 --> 23:09.920\nNo, our audience is mixing well.\n\n23:09.920 --> 23:10.880\nI'm into therapy.\n\n23:10.880 --> 23:11.960\nI have a therapist.\n\n23:11.960 --> 23:17.720\nDoes your therapist watch your show, HBO's Crashing?\n\n23:17.720 --> 23:19.920\nYeah, I hope so.\n\n23:19.920 --> 23:21.800\nAnd then, well, what do you mean you hope so?\n\n23:21.800 --> 23:23.360\nBecause you're in therapy once a week.\n\n23:23.360 --> 23:25.920\nAnd do you go in and go, it's like that one episode?\n\n23:25.920 --> 23:28.920\nAnd do they go, yeah, I saw it.\n\n23:28.920 --> 23:30.880\nWell, I don't want any spoilers for him.\n\n23:30.880 --> 23:32.760\nI want to be free to talk about it.\n\n23:32.760 --> 23:33.480\nWell, previously.\n\n23:33.480 --> 23:35.800\nNo, ruining it for him.\n\n23:35.800 --> 23:36.960\nThat's not real.\n\n23:36.960 --> 23:38.680\nI'm asking a real question.\n\n23:38.680 --> 23:41.240\nDoes your therapist acknowledge the content\n\n23:41.240 --> 23:43.000\nthat you create in your therapy sessions?\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:47.640\nBecause with therapists, for me, I'm looking for surrogate dads.\n\n23:47.640 --> 23:51.440\nSo I want someone to say, I'm very proud of you, Peter.\n\n23:51.440 --> 23:53.480\nYou did a good job on that episode.\n\n23:53.480 --> 23:57.120\nAnd if they, I just collect dads.\n\n23:57.120 --> 23:59.240\nLike, I have a dad.\n\n23:59.240 --> 24:00.240\nAnd he's great.\n\n24:00.240 --> 24:01.520\nBut I could use some more.\n\n24:05.520 --> 24:07.320\nLike, no offense to my dad.\n\n24:07.320 --> 24:08.560\nNo, OK, yeah.\n\n24:08.560 --> 24:11.640\nLet's get some more of that in here.\n\n24:11.640 --> 24:16.880\nLike, my mom was so into me a little too much.\n\n24:16.880 --> 24:19.760\nAnd then my dad was, you know, my dad\n\n24:19.760 --> 24:24.680\ncalls Judd Apatow Jeff Applebaum, which is fine.\n\n24:24.680 --> 24:28.520\nI guess he doesn't need to know what it is that I do.\n\n24:28.520 --> 24:33.600\nBut then I hire other men that are around his age.\n\n24:33.600 --> 24:35.800\nWho are like, so you talk to Judd Apatow,\n\n24:35.800 --> 24:38.720\nand you're like, OK, this is like, I got my dad, but he knows.\n\n24:38.720 --> 24:40.120\nPapa?\n\n24:40.120 --> 24:41.240\nYeah.\n\n24:41.240 --> 24:45.760\nAnd then we hug, and it costs $42,000.\n\n24:45.760 --> 24:46.760\nIt's not really that much.\n\n24:46.760 --> 24:50.360\nIf you're thinking about going to therapy, go for it.\n\n24:50.360 --> 24:51.960\nMost of you have been to a therapist, right?\n\n24:51.960 --> 24:53.880\nClap if you've been to a therapist.\n\n24:53.880 --> 24:57.480\nBecause my therapist said, this was a while ago,\n\n24:57.480 --> 25:00.440\nmy therapist at one point, I remember her saying to me,\n\n25:00.440 --> 25:04.200\nyeah, I wanted to let you know that I was going on a road\n\n25:04.200 --> 25:07.840\ntrip, and I asked my friend to recommend some stuff\n\n25:07.840 --> 25:10.160\nto listen to while I was driving for five hours.\n\n25:10.160 --> 25:13.200\nAnd she gave me this list of things.\n\n25:13.200 --> 25:19.440\nAnd on it was you talking to some Pete Holmes guy.\n\n25:19.440 --> 25:21.280\nI was like, she didn't know either of us.\n\n25:21.280 --> 25:27.320\nShe was just like, you know, that to me, actually,\n\n25:27.320 --> 25:30.920\nthat's unhealthy or not.\n\n25:30.920 --> 25:33.440\nYou like that she popoos you.\n\n25:33.440 --> 25:35.480\nThat's give me more moms.\n\n25:35.480 --> 25:41.040\nYeah, like don't ever cross the threshold where you're like,\n\n25:41.040 --> 25:43.680\nI saw it, I saw community.\n\n25:43.680 --> 25:44.360\nYou're brilliant.\n\n25:44.360 --> 25:45.360\nYeah.\n\n25:45.360 --> 25:48.040\nAnd then it's like, well, so tell me what you're saying.\n\n25:48.040 --> 25:50.680\nI don't like it when my gardener bitch is too much.\n\n25:50.680 --> 25:52.840\nAnd then they're like, OK, interesting.\n\n25:52.840 --> 25:54.400\nI loved community a little bit.\n\n25:54.400 --> 25:55.520\nBut now it's real.\n\n25:55.520 --> 25:56.080\nI don't know.\n\n25:56.080 --> 25:57.800\nLike it just feels like I would cross the threshold.\n\n25:57.800 --> 25:59.640\nYou want permission to be ugly, so you don't want to be up on it.\n\n25:59.640 --> 26:01.400\nYeah, and I like it.\n\n26:01.400 --> 26:06.480\nI like that I like in air quotes, but I don't like it.\n\n26:06.480 --> 26:10.400\nBut because I complained about it, I'm like, this bitch,\n\n26:10.400 --> 26:12.880\nall she got to do is watch the Rick and Morty.\n\n26:12.880 --> 26:13.640\nRight.\n\n26:13.640 --> 26:16.000\nBut then I think about it and go, if she did,\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:19.600\nand she was like, I did it, and I watched Rick and Morty.\n\n26:19.600 --> 26:22.600\nSit down.\n\n26:22.600 --> 26:24.640\nLet's talk more about your feelings.\n\n26:24.640 --> 26:26.120\nI think something would, I think there\n\n26:26.120 --> 26:28.600\nwould be a membrane cross that would like,\n\n26:28.600 --> 26:29.720\nI think I wouldn't.\n\n26:29.720 --> 26:33.320\nWell, you'd be her entertainment Santa Claus.\n\n26:33.320 --> 26:35.720\nAnd you don't want to break her heart by being like,\n\n26:35.720 --> 26:39.760\nI jerked off to a photo of my grandfather.\n\n26:39.760 --> 26:42.800\nI think it's, I think I never thought about it in those terms,\n\n26:42.800 --> 26:47.000\nbut you want to be a new season.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:51.080\nI think I, well, to the people that watch the show.\n\n26:51.080 --> 26:52.000\nYeah, that's right.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.560\nYeah, you don't want to mix the two.\n\n26:53.560 --> 26:59.560\nSanta wants a Jewish therapist, is what I'm saying.\n\n26:59.560 --> 27:04.240\nHe wants to go and go, it's so nice to not have the pressure\n\n27:04.240 --> 27:06.240\nto be so fucking married.\n\n27:06.240 --> 27:08.360\nYou know what I mean?\n\n27:08.360 --> 27:10.240\nI just covelled for a while.\n\n27:10.240 --> 27:13.560\nYeah, Santa's therapist is Jewish.\n\n27:13.560 --> 27:16.160\nOr, you know, none.\n\n27:16.160 --> 27:18.800\nYeah, no, it makes perfect sense.\n\n27:18.800 --> 27:22.360\nI never, it was more about like, I actually\n\n27:22.360 --> 27:26.520\nhave a diseased part of me that thinks about,\n\n27:26.520 --> 27:29.160\nit's the part of me that wants people to like me.\n\n27:29.160 --> 27:31.200\nThat makes me do things.\n\n27:31.200 --> 27:34.360\nSo, oh, everybody like me, everybody like me.\n\n27:34.360 --> 27:36.800\nAnd then you think about it like, flip that piece,\n\n27:36.800 --> 27:40.520\nand that idea of like, oh, that person likes me,\n\n27:40.520 --> 27:45.080\nso I can put a pin in them, and I can focus on the world\n\n27:45.080 --> 27:46.080\nthat doesn't like me.\n\n27:46.080 --> 27:48.360\nYeah, move on to the other pieces.\n\n27:48.360 --> 27:51.280\nDo you have a relationship with that concept?\n\n27:51.280 --> 27:52.440\nMaking people like me?\n\n27:52.440 --> 27:55.440\nAn addiction to it, a horrible, like, explosion.\n\n27:55.440 --> 27:59.280\nYeah, I used to be worse about being a people pleaser.\n\n27:59.280 --> 28:01.440\nI think, is that, do you relate to that term?\n\n28:01.440 --> 28:03.120\nYeah, an approval addiction.\n\n28:03.120 --> 28:05.840\nYeah, and then I sort of started to get over it.\n\n28:05.840 --> 28:07.440\nTherapy actually really helped with that.\n\n28:07.440 --> 28:09.920\nLike, my mother came over, we just had a baby,\n\n28:09.920 --> 28:13.120\nand the mom, the mom, the mom character, came over.\n\n28:13.120 --> 28:18.600\nShe's played by Irina Holmes, she fucking, she's perfect.\n\n28:18.600 --> 28:21.280\nShe comes over and she goes, we got you a,\n\n28:21.280 --> 28:24.240\nwe bought baby Lila, we got her a book.\n\n28:24.240 --> 28:27.240\nIt's an alphabet book, but it's cars, and I'm like,\n\n28:29.240 --> 28:32.520\nlike, wow, that sounds like fucking bullshit.\n\n28:32.520 --> 28:35.800\nBut thanks, and then she goes, but we left it\n\n28:35.800 --> 28:40.800\nin a diner in Pasadena, could you go get it for us?\n\n28:41.960 --> 28:43.800\nAnd we have a one month old baby,\n\n28:43.800 --> 28:46.640\nand I'll just laugh in her face.\n\n28:46.640 --> 28:48.840\nNot in a mean way, but in the nice way,\n\n28:48.840 --> 28:50.520\nyou can laugh in someone's face,\n\n28:50.520 --> 28:53.240\nbut I will say like, fucking no.\n\n28:54.240 --> 28:56.600\nThat's not a gift, that's an errand.\n\n28:57.800 --> 29:00.120\nAnd I think there was a time pre-therapy\n\n29:00.120 --> 29:02.720\nbefore I knew what a boundary was to just be like,\n\n29:02.720 --> 29:05.320\nno mom, we're taking care of the baby.\n\n29:05.320 --> 29:07.920\nI hear that you like the book and you want me to like you,\n\n29:07.920 --> 29:10.920\nbut we're not gonna drive to, and they made my brother do it.\n\n29:10.920 --> 29:14.520\nI wonder how much that boundary comes out,\n\n29:14.520 --> 29:17.400\nbecause it seems like, by and large,\n\n29:17.400 --> 29:20.400\nI don't wanna make a generalization that is unfair\n\n29:20.400 --> 29:23.200\nto anyone out there that needs to be arrested,\n\n29:23.200 --> 29:28.200\nbut it seems like having kids tends to bring the best\n\n29:28.200 --> 29:31.880\nout of people, and God knows that's why probably\n\n29:31.880 --> 29:33.200\na lot of people have kids that shouldn't,\n\n29:33.200 --> 29:34.440\nbecause they're like, you know what,\n\n29:34.440 --> 29:39.440\nI've seen how this works, but it does kind of elevate you\n\n29:40.640 --> 29:43.320\nin a way that is no conscious choice.\n\n29:43.320 --> 29:45.280\nYour kid is two months old now.\n\n29:45.280 --> 29:46.120\nTwo months, yeah.\n\n29:46.120 --> 29:49.080\nLike you're the closest astronaut we have to orbit,\n\n29:49.080 --> 29:50.920\nif we don't have kids, it'll be like,\n\n29:50.920 --> 29:52.160\nhow much of this shit is real?\n\n29:52.160 --> 29:55.400\nDoes it come out and alter you?\n\n29:55.400 --> 29:57.560\nWell, I will say that people say it makes you\n\n29:57.560 --> 30:01.120\nunderstand your parents more.\n\n30:01.120 --> 30:01.960\nNo way.\n\n30:01.960 --> 30:03.360\nAh!\n\n30:03.360 --> 30:05.080\nThey're just like, it will make you,\n\n30:05.080 --> 30:08.160\nyou'll call your mom and be like, thank you so much.\n\n30:08.160 --> 30:10.040\nI'm like, straight Chris Rock about it.\n\n30:10.040 --> 30:12.480\nI'm like, yeah, you did what you were supposed to do.\n\n30:12.480 --> 30:15.080\nYou had a baby, fucking feed the baby.\n\n30:15.080 --> 30:17.080\nI, maybe I'm in the minority,\n\n30:17.080 --> 30:19.360\nor maybe you just are young and don't give a fuck.\n\n30:19.360 --> 30:21.320\nThat's what I've noticed, is nobody gives a shit\n\n30:21.320 --> 30:22.480\nabout your baby.\n\n30:24.080 --> 30:26.760\nNo one cares, especially in L.A.\n\n30:26.760 --> 30:28.320\nExcept for other baby people,\n\n30:28.320 --> 30:29.920\nand they care too much.\n\n30:29.920 --> 30:32.360\nI will say, it did ruin porn.\n\n30:34.360 --> 30:35.200\nGo on.\n\n30:36.480 --> 30:38.720\nWell, I tried to watch porn, she's a girl,\n\n30:38.720 --> 30:40.000\nbut it doesn't even matter, she's a baby,\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:41.320\nas a person, and then you start thinking\n\n30:41.320 --> 30:42.960\nabout how all people were babies.\n\n30:42.960 --> 30:44.840\nI'm not trying to, I'm not like anti-porn,\n\n30:44.840 --> 30:45.680\nbut it did ruin it.\n\n30:45.680 --> 30:46.520\nThen I watched porn.\n\n30:46.520 --> 30:48.880\nYou think about body parts differently,\n\n30:48.880 --> 30:50.640\nyou think about breasts differently.\n\n30:50.640 --> 30:51.680\nI'm glad you brought that up because I like it.\n\n30:51.680 --> 30:53.520\nSo I watch a lesbian scene and I'm like,\n\n30:53.520 --> 30:56.920\noh, she's got a good latch.\n\n30:59.480 --> 31:00.800\nWhat?\n\n31:00.800 --> 31:04.000\nOh, what does that mean?\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.480\nIt's when a baby's breastfeeding,\n\n31:05.480 --> 31:06.800\nit gets a good hookup.\n\n31:06.800 --> 31:07.640\nOh!\n\n31:07.640 --> 31:08.640\nYou know, like when Eric, Eric?\n\n31:11.080 --> 31:12.800\nBut like pornography,\n\n31:14.080 --> 31:16.960\npornography is weird because sex is to make a baby.\n\n31:16.960 --> 31:18.400\nI'm not saying it can't be for pleasure,\n\n31:18.400 --> 31:21.800\nbut the point of it, evolutionarily, is to make a baby.\n\n31:21.800 --> 31:24.160\nBut you never see that in pornography.\n\n31:24.160 --> 31:25.120\nThat's weird.\n\n31:25.120 --> 31:26.120\nRight, that would be a,\n\n31:26.120 --> 31:29.680\nit's a time-consuming fetish to cater to.\n\n31:29.680 --> 31:31.520\nThat's right.\n\n31:31.520 --> 31:33.120\nIt involves all those time-lapse,\n\n31:33.120 --> 31:35.440\nand that's like, I'm sure it will.\n\n31:35.440 --> 31:40.440\nCheck out Rocco Safredi and Chania Boobs a lot.\n\n31:40.720 --> 31:42.960\nLike, there's more turnover with the women,\n\n31:42.960 --> 31:43.800\nso I don't know.\n\n31:43.800 --> 31:44.640\nChania Boobs a lot.\n\n31:44.640 --> 31:48.600\nAnd like, watch them, watch them raise a little adult.\n\n31:48.600 --> 31:51.120\nI think that's one of the, not to be gross,\n\n31:51.120 --> 31:53.000\nbut I think that's one of the reasons why\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.880\nthe guy never, sorry, this is gross.\n\n31:54.880 --> 31:56.680\nHe never finishes in.\n\n31:56.680 --> 31:57.640\nRight.\n\n31:57.640 --> 31:59.880\nI think guys like that on a certain level,\n\n31:59.880 --> 32:03.000\nyou're like, that's hot, and very responsible.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.600\nLike you're kind of like, because like-\n\n32:05.600 --> 32:07.280\nWell, I think it, I think, I think it,\n\n32:07.280 --> 32:08.200\nI think it's the same thing,\n\n32:08.200 --> 32:10.840\nbut I think it's like psychologically men\n\n32:10.840 --> 32:12.360\nthat on a primal level,\n\n32:12.360 --> 32:17.200\nyou think of finishing in as\n\n32:18.200 --> 32:20.600\ncrossing a threshold into connection.\n\n32:20.600 --> 32:21.440\nChoice.\n\n32:21.440 --> 32:22.260\nOh, that's true.\n\n32:22.260 --> 32:27.260\nAnd everything being exterior comforts the primal male,\n\n32:27.280 --> 32:29.080\nwho's like, all I want to do is think about sex.\n\n32:29.080 --> 32:31.920\nAnd that's like a big, the big celebration.\n\n32:31.920 --> 32:36.760\nCause what is, what is really sexy about the image?\n\n32:36.760 --> 32:38.920\nYou know, like everyone agree\n\n32:38.920 --> 32:41.160\nthat it's definitely something we project onto it.\n\n32:41.160 --> 32:43.880\nIt's not the Bellagio like,\n\n32:43.880 --> 32:45.760\nphones that like doesn't look pretty.\n\n32:45.760 --> 32:48.320\nBut like, it's sort of, I think it like,\n\n32:48.320 --> 32:50.640\nit's, we celebrate it as like-\n\n32:50.640 --> 32:51.480\nWell, I think there's-\n\n32:51.480 --> 32:53.800\nThere, see, and I didn't clean my room.\n\n32:53.800 --> 32:54.960\nI did the opposite.\n\n32:54.960 --> 32:56.040\nYeah, no, it's rebellious.\n\n32:56.040 --> 32:57.920\nAnd you're also wasting it.\n\n32:57.920 --> 32:59.600\nYeah, I'm wasting it, I'm wasting it.\n\n32:59.600 --> 33:01.720\nYeah, that's, it's like, yeah.\n\n33:01.720 --> 33:04.600\nI only watch porn where the guy comes into a wood chipper.\n\n33:04.600 --> 33:09.600\nI just want to see that Fargo blast of steam.\n\n33:09.600 --> 33:11.680\nHe comes into it, dude.\n\n33:11.680 --> 33:12.520\nOh!\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:17.520\nOh! That's the only way I can come.\n\n33:19.760 --> 33:21.920\nHe comes into a tiny capsule\n\n33:21.920 --> 33:25.080\nand it gets loaded into a rocket and shot\n\n33:25.080 --> 33:28.160\nto a planet guaranteed to never make use of it.\n\n33:29.280 --> 33:31.360\nThat would make men like really happy.\n\n33:31.360 --> 33:33.040\nI used to have a joke about it though.\n\n33:33.040 --> 33:36.280\nIt's weird that you never finish in the vagina.\n\n33:36.280 --> 33:39.440\nAnd, but the point evolutionary is to make a baby.\n\n33:39.440 --> 33:41.120\nThat would be like inviting someone over to your house\n\n33:41.120 --> 33:42.440\nto make a cake.\n\n33:42.440 --> 33:44.080\nAnd you're like, you want to, you want to make a cake\n\n33:44.080 --> 33:45.000\non Saturday?\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:46.320\nThey're like, yeah, let's make a cake.\n\n33:46.320 --> 33:48.640\nAnd then you get a, you come over on this cake day,\n\n33:48.640 --> 33:50.960\nyou get a big bowl and you put milk and cream\n\n33:50.960 --> 33:52.960\nand eggs in the bowl and sugar and you whip it up\n\n33:52.960 --> 33:54.560\nand you're like, we're making a fucking cake, aren't we?\n\n33:54.560 --> 33:57.120\nAnd you're like, yeah, we're making a fucking cake.\n\n33:57.120 --> 33:59.120\nAnd you preheat the oven, but at the last second\n\n33:59.120 --> 34:00.120\ninstead of putting it in the oven,\n\n34:00.120 --> 34:01.920\nyou just throw it in their face.\n\n34:03.760 --> 34:05.120\nJust like, boom!\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:07.960\nNo cake today!\n\n34:07.960 --> 34:10.040\nLook in the camera and say bang bros.\n\n34:10.040 --> 34:15.040\nLook in that camera and say bang bros, baking edition.\n\n34:18.840 --> 34:21.720\nAnd I think part of the perversion of the male mind\n\n34:21.720 --> 34:24.400\nis like, and nobody's being a dad today.\n\n34:24.400 --> 34:26.520\nYeah, no, honestly, I mean, don't you think\n\n34:26.520 --> 34:27.360\nthat's really it?\n\n34:27.360 --> 34:29.440\nNo, the first time, my wife and I were trying\n\n34:29.440 --> 34:31.680\nto have a baby and the first time you do it,\n\n34:31.680 --> 34:32.960\nsome guys love it.\n\n34:32.960 --> 34:36.720\nSome guys who aren't trying to have a baby do it in there.\n\n34:36.720 --> 34:39.920\nIt was a first for me when I was trying\n\n34:39.920 --> 34:40.760\nto get pregnant.\n\n34:40.760 --> 34:42.560\nI'm incredibly privileged.\n\n34:42.560 --> 34:47.400\nI've had a string of partners who are always doing\n\n34:47.400 --> 34:51.400\nthis extra shit for me that I don't,\n\n34:53.400 --> 34:56.000\nthe pill is a big deal for her.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:57.040\nBut it's like, yeah.\n\n34:57.040 --> 34:57.880\nSomebody said that.\n\n34:57.880 --> 35:00.920\nSomebody went birth control, which I get,\n\n35:00.920 --> 35:04.480\nbut why not give it an assist?\n\n35:04.480 --> 35:06.760\nYou listen to them?\n\n35:06.760 --> 35:08.160\nI listen to them sometimes.\n\n35:08.160 --> 35:12.640\nThat is going to lead to a, yeah.\n\n35:12.640 --> 35:17.240\nBut you have girlfriends that explain their history\n\n35:17.240 --> 35:18.680\nwith the pill.\n\n35:18.680 --> 35:22.280\nI'll be absolutely confessional and be like,\n\n35:22.280 --> 35:24.760\nthere's so much entitlement there.\n\n35:24.760 --> 35:31.920\nBecause of my history of, I'm encountering female partners\n\n35:31.920 --> 35:35.800\nand their history involves them being totally\n\n35:35.800 --> 35:38.560\nused to taking a pill.\n\n35:38.560 --> 35:42.200\nBut then you meet, you have, then you go like,\n\n35:42.200 --> 35:43.920\noh yeah, well my period gets all fucked up\n\n35:43.920 --> 35:45.200\nor I go through a lot of shit.\n\n35:45.200 --> 35:46.400\nI don't know.\n\n35:46.400 --> 35:49.360\nIf men took the pill, it would be 99% of standup.\n\n35:49.360 --> 35:52.640\nIt would be, yeah.\n\n35:52.640 --> 35:54.440\nThat it's bullshit that we have to take the pill.\n\n35:54.440 --> 35:56.920\nAnd it's like, my dick, it moves to the left now.\n\n35:56.920 --> 35:58.320\nUsed to go to the right.\n\n35:58.320 --> 35:59.320\nI break out.\n\n35:59.320 --> 36:00.560\nI forget to take it.\n\n36:00.560 --> 36:01.880\nI panic.\n\n36:01.880 --> 36:04.160\nFour of them are sugar, and I'm trying to do no sugar\n\n36:04.160 --> 36:07.040\nright now.\n\n36:07.040 --> 36:08.120\nNo, it's fucking insane.\n\n36:08.120 --> 36:09.440\nAnd my wife just had the baby.\n\n36:09.440 --> 36:11.640\nAnd then she's like, we're talking about birth control.\n\n36:11.640 --> 36:13.720\nBecause you can get pregnant pretty much right away\n\n36:13.720 --> 36:14.720\nafterwards.\n\n36:14.720 --> 36:16.680\nAnd she was like, well, I can either take the pill\n\n36:16.680 --> 36:20.800\nand have my hormones completely fucked, potentially.\n\n36:20.800 --> 36:24.760\nOr we could become Amish, like another one comes right.\n\n36:24.760 --> 36:25.360\nYeah, exactly.\n\n36:25.360 --> 36:27.760\nOr you can get an IUD, which, as I understand it,\n\n36:27.760 --> 36:31.760\nis like a mouth harp that a hillbilly is just like,\n\n36:31.760 --> 36:33.400\nThank you for being politically correct.\n\n36:33.400 --> 36:37.560\nDang, dang, dang, y'all, you want this to stop the babies?\n\n36:37.560 --> 36:39.520\nAnd then you have to like, apparently, you have to like,\n\n36:39.520 --> 36:42.920\nget all your hand up there and put it in the pelvis.\n\n36:42.920 --> 36:43.680\nAnd then it works.\n\n36:43.680 --> 36:47.960\nAnd medicine is like, we don't even know why.\n\n36:47.960 --> 36:49.800\nIt's just a hillbilly's mouth harp.\n\n36:49.800 --> 36:51.080\nGet it up in you.\n\n36:51.080 --> 36:53.400\nWe stopped changing the shape when people stopped\n\n36:53.400 --> 36:53.920\ngetting pregnant.\n\n36:53.920 --> 36:54.600\nThat's right.\n\n36:54.600 --> 36:57.440\nFor all we know, it's supposed to be shaped like.\n\n36:57.440 --> 36:59.440\nAlso, people got tired of fucking hearing\n\n36:59.440 --> 37:02.760\ncamptown racist.\n\n37:02.760 --> 37:04.120\nI couldn't get it out clean.\n\n37:04.120 --> 37:05.720\nThat was excellent.\n\n37:05.720 --> 37:08.880\nDang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang.\n\n37:08.880 --> 37:12.400\nDo the only song you can play.\n\n37:12.400 --> 37:13.440\nThere's three IUDs.\n\n37:13.440 --> 37:14.560\nThere's Tricky and the Straw.\n\n37:14.560 --> 37:16.440\nThere's Captain Races.\n\n37:16.440 --> 37:19.040\nAnd there's, I think, a little brown jug.\n\n37:19.040 --> 37:26.800\nBut my point is, if there's a pill, Dan, I give you a pill\n\n37:26.800 --> 37:30.400\nand you won't turn into a zombie if it bites you, right?\n\n37:30.400 --> 37:32.960\nAnd then you go out to eat with a zombie\n\n37:32.960 --> 37:34.840\nand he's going to bite you.\n\n37:34.840 --> 37:36.120\nBut you've had a nice time.\n\n37:36.120 --> 37:38.440\nWouldn't you just stop him from biting you?\n\n37:38.440 --> 37:41.120\nWait, no, wait, I want to access the metaphor.\n\n37:41.120 --> 37:42.880\nI made so much more sense in my head.\n\n37:42.880 --> 37:45.200\nWhat I'm saying is.\n\n37:45.200 --> 37:46.320\nLet's take that from the top.\n\n37:46.320 --> 37:47.440\nTake it from the top.\n\n37:47.440 --> 37:48.080\nFinish.\n\n37:48.080 --> 37:48.600\nI'm sorry.\n\n37:48.600 --> 37:51.240\nThere's a pill that makes you proved again.\n\n37:51.240 --> 37:53.000\nWhat I'm saying is, why not pull out?\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:54.040\nYes, the pill works.\n\n37:54.040 --> 37:56.920\nBut wouldn't it work better if that stuff isn't even in there?\n\n37:56.920 --> 37:57.420\nRight.\n\n37:57.420 --> 38:00.960\nSo there's a pill that the zombie bite won't make you a zombie.\n\n38:00.960 --> 38:02.760\nBut why not just be like, hey, don't fucking bite me\n\n38:02.760 --> 38:08.320\nbecause we're having a great time tiddy fucking anyway.\n\n38:08.320 --> 38:10.360\nYou're saying we owe it to our partners\n\n38:10.360 --> 38:12.280\nto pull out and come on them.\n\n38:12.280 --> 38:12.880\nYes.\n\n38:12.880 --> 38:14.400\nWe owe it to them.\n\n38:14.400 --> 38:19.080\nOr just come into a wood chipper and fucking.\n\n38:19.080 --> 38:23.080\nThey should make little mini bedside wood chippers.\n\n38:23.080 --> 38:26.000\nThey do.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:29.200\nPetehomes.com.\n\n38:29.200 --> 38:31.080\nThe undominator.\n\n38:31.080 --> 38:35.320\nI'm just saying, is it that much better to leave it in?\n\n38:35.320 --> 38:37.080\nI don't think so.\n\n38:37.080 --> 38:42.320\nHonestly, I have to say, it truly is.\n\n38:42.320 --> 38:43.320\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n38:43.320 --> 38:45.520\nYou didn't let me finish my sentence.\n\n38:45.520 --> 38:50.320\nNo, I have to say, it truly is a matter of laziness.\n\n38:50.320 --> 38:51.880\nLike, absolutely.\n\n38:51.880 --> 38:53.600\nLike, men would not.\n\n38:53.600 --> 38:56.880\nI can't be pulling out all day long.\n\n38:56.880 --> 38:57.760\nHow do I lose the weight?\n\n38:57.760 --> 38:59.320\nI'm doing the pull out method.\n\n38:59.320 --> 39:00.280\nI'm using my eyes to take it slow.\n\n39:00.280 --> 39:02.440\nBurns a lot of cows.\n\n39:02.440 --> 39:05.640\nI will speak for myself and say, definitely,\n\n39:05.640 --> 39:10.960\nif Cody being on the pill was also.\n\n39:10.960 --> 39:14.120\nAre you really on the pill?\n\n39:14.120 --> 39:18.360\nIf she was like, also, it's only this and that effective\n\n39:18.360 --> 39:22.000\nand it would be helpful to the couple if you also pulled out,\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:23.600\nthen I would pull out.\n\n39:23.600 --> 39:26.840\nBut I would use the excuse of, it's\n\n39:26.840 --> 39:29.120\nlike you get on a train and there's a bar car\n\n39:29.120 --> 39:32.800\nand you're like, that means I should drink.\n\n39:32.800 --> 39:34.880\nNo one told you you should.\n\n39:34.880 --> 39:38.400\nBut you're like, no one's telling me I shouldn't.\n\n39:38.400 --> 39:41.840\nAnd so leaving it in is like, that to me is like the line.\n\n39:41.840 --> 39:43.720\nIt's like, if anyone asked me to, I would.\n\n39:43.720 --> 39:46.320\nI would call your lifestyle Golden Corral.\n\n39:46.320 --> 39:54.000\nLike that should be on your business card.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.960\nDo you think there will ever be a million man march for me?\n\n39:56.960 --> 39:59.120\nFor you, I think it's on the way.\n\n39:59.120 --> 40:00.800\nYou're in the pill.\n\n40:00.800 --> 40:02.440\nBut what's that?\n\n40:02.440 --> 40:03.080\nAll right, so.\n\n40:03.080 --> 40:03.880\nPills in you.\n\n40:03.880 --> 40:10.240\nSo you've been at your profession for,\n\n40:10.240 --> 40:13.880\nI'm not going to say a long time, that would be unsexy.\n\n40:13.880 --> 40:15.080\nNo, but it's been 20 years.\n\n40:15.080 --> 40:16.400\nYou're a fucking warrior.\n\n40:16.400 --> 40:18.360\nYou've been doing stand-up.\n\n40:18.360 --> 40:22.080\nYou gracefully, if not acrobatically,\n\n40:22.080 --> 40:24.280\nplunged into the podcast medium.\n\n40:24.280 --> 40:27.920\nYou also survived then into the streaming thing\n\n40:27.920 --> 40:30.760\nand your prestigious pay cable.\n\n40:30.760 --> 40:31.840\nWhat's your secret?\n\n40:31.840 --> 40:35.960\nI was kind of like, I thought I'd come up with a question.\n\n40:35.960 --> 40:38.320\nAnd then I was like, what question would that be?\n\n40:38.320 --> 40:39.200\nWhat's your secret?\n\n40:39.200 --> 40:40.400\nWould really be the only question.\n\n40:40.400 --> 40:41.320\nWhat is your secret?\n\n40:41.320 --> 40:43.560\nNo, but I don't know what my question would be.\n\n40:43.560 --> 40:44.880\nI want to make that observation.\n\n40:44.880 --> 40:47.320\nYou're like, you're a survivor.\n\n40:47.320 --> 40:50.560\nI will say, though, that it didn't, if it means anything\n\n40:50.560 --> 40:52.480\nto the audience.\n\n40:52.480 --> 40:55.560\nYou have to lift with your legs.\n\n40:55.560 --> 40:57.320\nI once drew a New Yorker cartoon.\n\n40:57.320 --> 40:58.200\nIt was two spiders.\n\n40:58.200 --> 41:00.880\nAnd there were just circles with lots of legs coming out\n\n41:00.880 --> 41:01.600\nof them.\n\n41:01.600 --> 41:04.480\nAnd the caption was, lift with your legs,\n\n41:04.480 --> 41:06.520\nnot the one part of you that's not legs.\n\n41:09.520 --> 41:11.560\nThat was my problem when I was a cartoonist.\n\n41:11.560 --> 41:14.360\nEvery cartoon I handed them, I was like, that's fucking better\n\n41:14.360 --> 41:16.000\nthan everything you run.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:16.840\nWait, did you submit?\n\n41:16.840 --> 41:18.840\nIt was better than everything you run.\n\n41:18.840 --> 41:21.960\nWere you submitting as a contest entry?\n\n41:21.960 --> 41:25.040\nNo, no, I've been in the New Yorker four times.\n\n41:25.040 --> 41:28.520\nAnd you've been in a New Yorker caption?\n\n41:28.520 --> 41:29.200\nI know.\n\n41:29.200 --> 41:30.000\nI know.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:30.800\nNobody cares.\n\n41:30.800 --> 41:31.520\nIt's like my baby.\n\n41:31.520 --> 41:33.320\nNobody cares.\n\n41:33.320 --> 41:34.480\nThey care.\n\n41:34.480 --> 41:35.320\nAnd I do, too.\n\n41:35.320 --> 41:37.480\nBecause I have friends who are obsessed with that.\n\n41:37.480 --> 41:39.600\nAnd they'll like email, they'll forward emails and go,\n\n41:39.600 --> 41:41.080\nguys, we got this.\n\n41:41.080 --> 41:41.960\nOh, the caption?\n\n41:41.960 --> 41:42.800\nAnd I will sit there.\n\n41:42.800 --> 41:45.120\nYou know what's funny about it is they probably do.\n\n41:45.120 --> 41:47.920\nI know the cartoon editor, the old cartoon editor.\n\n41:47.920 --> 41:50.200\nAnd he told me that for the caption contest,\n\n41:50.200 --> 41:53.280\nit's like 80% of the time people submit\n\n41:53.280 --> 41:55.320\nwhat the caption was.\n\n41:55.320 --> 41:56.240\nOh, really?\n\n41:56.240 --> 41:57.400\nYeah, there's a correct answer.\n\n41:57.400 --> 41:59.080\nOh, they take the caption off?\n\n41:59.080 --> 41:59.520\nYes.\n\n41:59.520 --> 42:01.280\nOh, is it just a shitty cartoon?\n\n42:01.280 --> 42:02.640\nIt's not a shitty cartoon.\n\n42:02.640 --> 42:04.280\nIt's probably a more visual cartoon.\n\n42:04.280 --> 42:07.120\nBut they don't run the people that got it right.\n\n42:07.120 --> 42:08.880\nThey have to do the other one, right?\n\n42:08.880 --> 42:10.480\nNo, well, they have three finalists.\n\n42:10.480 --> 42:12.600\nAnd one of them is definitely the one that was right.\n\n42:12.600 --> 42:13.080\nOh, really?\n\n42:13.080 --> 42:15.880\nBut every cartoon, as I've known, that's had it in there,\n\n42:15.880 --> 42:17.880\nusually the winner is what they probably run.\n\n42:17.880 --> 42:18.360\nGod damn it.\n\n42:18.360 --> 42:21.360\nThis is a fucking revolution.\n\n42:21.360 --> 42:22.320\nIf anyone is listening.\n\n42:22.320 --> 42:26.520\nI'm here to drop some upper middle class knowledge.\n\n42:26.520 --> 42:29.960\nDo you own a beret or a turtleneck?\n\n42:29.960 --> 42:33.720\nI'm ready to fucking blow your dick off, dude.\n\n42:33.720 --> 42:37.120\nDo you remember Phil Ward, Dan, from LA Comedy Sports?\n\n42:37.120 --> 42:38.560\nYeah.\n\n42:38.560 --> 42:41.000\nThis is before New Yorker.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:42.160\nIt's not before the New Yorker.\n\n42:42.160 --> 42:44.120\nLook, we're all hooked at Phil Waradam.\n\n42:44.120 --> 42:44.620\nOK.\n\n42:47.620 --> 42:51.800\nOh, man, if I was in the audience, I would have loved that.\n\n42:51.800 --> 42:54.200\nThere's a little Phil Waradam humor.\n\n42:54.200 --> 42:55.200\nHe's probably listening.\n\n42:55.200 --> 42:56.400\nNow I feel bad.\n\n42:56.400 --> 42:56.920\nI know.\n\n42:56.920 --> 42:59.960\nWell, he just drew a two-panel comic strip that really\n\n42:59.960 --> 43:00.800\nmade me really laugh.\n\n43:00.800 --> 43:03.880\nAnd it was in one panel, like reading left to right,\n\n43:03.880 --> 43:07.120\nthere was a pair of dice.\n\n43:07.120 --> 43:10.320\nAnd the second panel was completely empty.\n\n43:10.320 --> 43:15.160\nAnd the title said idioms explained.\n\n43:15.160 --> 43:20.240\nAnd it said dice, no dice.\n\n43:20.240 --> 43:24.440\nFucking, I was like, that's fucking beautiful.\n\n43:24.440 --> 43:27.400\nI like it OK.\n\n43:27.400 --> 43:27.960\nI'll tell you.\n\n43:27.960 --> 43:29.720\nBut you didn't see how funny the dice were.\n\n43:29.720 --> 43:30.560\nYeah, that's true.\n\n43:30.560 --> 43:31.060\nThat's true.\n\n43:31.060 --> 43:35.080\nWhat number were they on, 69?\n\n43:35.080 --> 43:36.480\nHow do you have a nine on a dice?\n\n43:36.480 --> 43:40.560\nYou've never played D&D, bro.\n\n43:40.560 --> 43:44.600\nOh, I'll tell you.\n\n43:44.600 --> 43:47.920\nI thought it was a throw to you wanting to play D&D with us.\n\n43:47.920 --> 43:50.000\nThat's what you'd play?\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nNo, that's what I had queued up there.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:52.520\nI like it.\n\n43:52.520 --> 43:54.960\nMy favorite cartoon that made me want to be a New Yorker\n\n43:54.960 --> 43:57.400\ncartoon is Bruce Eric Kaplan, who's a Seinfeld\n\n43:57.400 --> 43:59.480\nwriter, great TV writer.\n\n43:59.480 --> 44:00.680\nHe was a guy.\n\n44:00.680 --> 44:02.360\nIt's very New Yorker, so we're not going to laugh.\n\n44:02.360 --> 44:05.720\nWe're going to laugh like this.\n\n44:05.720 --> 44:10.120\nLike, don't move your face and swirl a branding.\n\n44:10.120 --> 44:12.960\nWe have a walk in fireplace like that sort of laugh.\n\n44:12.960 --> 44:16.240\nA walk in fireplace?\n\n44:16.240 --> 44:17.400\nI can clear it.\n\n44:17.400 --> 44:21.080\nThe height of class.\n\n44:21.080 --> 44:22.920\nA walk in fireplace.\n\n44:22.920 --> 44:25.320\nIf you're not shit, if you don't have a walk in fireplace.\n\n44:25.320 --> 44:28.360\nYou mean your house is on fire.\n\n44:28.360 --> 44:30.720\nAnd they're like, no, it never burns down.\n\n44:30.720 --> 44:31.640\nThat's the point.\n\n44:31.640 --> 44:33.720\nWe're bragging.\n\n44:33.720 --> 44:35.640\nI have a walk in fire.\n\n44:35.640 --> 44:37.840\nHe says it's a man talking to it.\n\n44:37.840 --> 44:39.280\nIt's at a cocktail party.\n\n44:39.280 --> 44:40.720\nHe's talking to a skeleton.\n\n44:40.720 --> 44:42.320\nSkeleton's not holding a drink or anything.\n\n44:42.320 --> 44:43.880\nIt's just standing like neutral.\n\n44:43.880 --> 44:46.720\nAnd the guy is saying, so Helen tells me you're dead.\n\n44:49.840 --> 44:52.000\nThat's 10 out of 10.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.040\nThat's as good as it gets.\n\n44:54.040 --> 44:55.560\nI love that.\n\n44:55.560 --> 45:00.600\nMy favorite cartoon that I drew that they didn't buy\n\n45:00.600 --> 45:01.960\nwas an avocado.\n\n45:01.960 --> 45:03.040\nAnd she had long eyelashes.\n\n45:03.040 --> 45:04.680\nYou could tell it was a lady avocado.\n\n45:04.680 --> 45:07.440\nShe was crying, talking to a male avocado.\n\n45:07.440 --> 45:09.960\nAnd she's saying, what do you mean I'm the good kind of fat?\n\n45:13.680 --> 45:15.760\nThey didn't buy it.\n\n45:15.760 --> 45:17.240\nThat's fantastic.\n\n45:17.240 --> 45:20.640\nThey didn't buy it.\n\n45:20.640 --> 45:25.080\nDo you have any idea the creative rage I still feel?\n\n45:25.080 --> 45:25.920\nI'm mad, too.\n\n45:25.920 --> 45:28.600\nAnd I was born in Wisconsin.\n\n45:28.600 --> 45:33.200\nAnd I have dirt still in my pants from the farm.\n\n45:33.200 --> 45:36.000\nAnd I know a good New Yorker cartoon when I hear it was.\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:37.000\nThat's a good one.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.440\nYou've done good.\n\n45:38.440 --> 45:41.440\nBut the ones that they bought, there was a guy in therapy\n\n45:41.440 --> 45:42.760\nand he said, I think I accidentally\n\n45:42.760 --> 45:45.880\nrepressed my good memories.\n\n45:45.880 --> 45:47.560\nThat was the first one.\n\n45:47.560 --> 45:51.040\nThe second one was a dog real estate agent.\n\n45:51.040 --> 45:52.480\nHow do you draw that first off?\n\n45:52.480 --> 45:53.960\nWell, it's like you, but a dog head.\n\n45:53.960 --> 45:55.160\nLike it's a human.\n\n45:55.160 --> 45:56.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n45:56.760 --> 45:58.440\nWho the fuck is that supposed to be?\n\n45:58.440 --> 45:59.080\nOh, OK.\n\n45:59.080 --> 45:59.720\nA guy in a suit.\n\n45:59.720 --> 46:00.080\nYeah, yeah.\n\n46:00.080 --> 46:02.120\nThe part of you you'd be insulted is if I was like,\n\n46:02.120 --> 46:08.400\nyou're fucking face dog shit, that's the insult.\n\n46:08.400 --> 46:11.160\nLike the bottom part of you, you're less sensitive about.\n\n46:11.160 --> 46:11.880\nAll right.\n\n46:11.880 --> 46:13.960\nHuman body suit, dog head.\n\n46:13.960 --> 46:17.040\nI feel nothing from the neck down anyway.\n\n46:17.040 --> 46:19.960\nAnd he's talking to a dog couple in front of a house\n\n46:19.960 --> 46:21.280\nthat says sold.\n\n46:21.280 --> 46:25.560\nAnd he's saying, well, the down payment's cleared\n\n46:25.560 --> 46:26.880\nand the paperwork is filed.\n\n46:26.880 --> 46:28.920\nAs soon as you pee on the lawn, the place is yours.\n\n46:28.920 --> 46:32.680\nThese are great.\n\n46:32.680 --> 46:34.280\nI mean, we'll always got in.\n\n46:34.280 --> 46:35.240\nI appreciate it.\n\n46:35.240 --> 46:36.000\nWait, but wait.\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:37.080\nThey weren't my best, though.\n\n46:37.080 --> 46:38.440\nThey were the four that they bought.\n\n46:38.440 --> 46:41.520\nI want to know how do you break into that?\n\n46:41.520 --> 46:44.040\nI love telling people this because it's hilarious.\n\n46:44.040 --> 46:47.880\nThe cartoon meeting, I love forecasting how things\n\n46:47.880 --> 46:51.680\nI'm about to say will go.\n\n46:51.680 --> 46:53.560\nI don't think it's like, ha, ha, hilarious.\n\n46:53.560 --> 46:55.480\nPeople are like, you have something like that.\n\n46:55.480 --> 46:59.520\nYou're going to go like, what?\n\n46:59.520 --> 47:01.480\nWhat's hilarious about it is that the cartoon meeting\n\n47:01.480 --> 47:04.520\nat the New Yorkers at Tuesdays, I think it's at 11 AM,\n\n47:04.520 --> 47:07.120\nand anyone can go.\n\n47:07.120 --> 47:08.120\nThat's what's hilarious.\n\n47:08.120 --> 47:10.440\nMeaning anyone listening, anyone here,\n\n47:10.440 --> 47:14.200\ngo to the CondÃ© Nast building, go up to the counter\n\n47:14.200 --> 47:16.200\nwith some cartoons and say, I'm here for the cartoon meeting.\n\n47:16.200 --> 47:17.720\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n47:17.720 --> 47:18.920\nWhat?\n\n47:18.920 --> 47:21.960\nAnd that is my little revenge for not buying the avocado\n\n47:21.960 --> 47:23.680\ncartoon.\n\n47:23.680 --> 47:26.080\nWhat is the point of being the New Yorker?\n\n47:26.080 --> 47:28.080\nWell, maybe that maximizes the point because it's\n\n47:28.080 --> 47:31.400\nelitism because it's like, hey, they should say,\n\n47:31.400 --> 47:32.840\nhere's your New Yorker cartoon.\n\n47:32.840 --> 47:35.560\nAnd then the subline should say, like,\n\n47:35.560 --> 47:38.600\nbuilt atop a mountain of poor people's skulls.\n\n47:38.600 --> 47:39.920\nOf course.\n\n47:39.920 --> 47:44.480\nHere's the cartoon that beat out everyone else that wanted\n\n47:44.480 --> 47:45.800\nto poke a bear for a penny.\n\n47:45.800 --> 47:46.720\nHere's what you'll enjoy.\n\n47:46.720 --> 47:47.200\nSorry.\n\n47:47.200 --> 47:49.160\nNo, go ahead.\n\n47:49.160 --> 47:51.600\nWhat I think is interesting is, so you could go.\n\n47:51.600 --> 47:54.840\nSo the first week that I went, I think I submitted cartoons\n\n47:54.840 --> 47:57.600\nfor sure that are good enough to be in the magazine.\n\n47:57.600 --> 47:59.800\nI'm sorry to say that, but I'm like, these are good enough.\n\n47:59.800 --> 48:02.240\nThe avocado one is fucking solid gold.\n\n48:02.240 --> 48:04.240\nSolid as a rock.\n\n48:04.240 --> 48:06.080\nBut here's the thing.\n\n48:06.080 --> 48:06.880\nThat was off mic.\n\n48:06.880 --> 48:08.040\nIt must have been really loud.\n\n48:08.040 --> 48:09.600\nOh my god.\n\n48:09.600 --> 48:10.200\nLet him out.\n\n48:10.200 --> 48:10.680\nGet in there.\n\n48:10.680 --> 48:12.440\nClean your room, Jacob.\n\n48:12.440 --> 48:13.840\nThat is fun.\n\n48:13.840 --> 48:15.680\nYou're fun, Golden Corral.\n\n48:15.680 --> 48:16.240\nAll right.\n\n48:16.240 --> 48:26.240\nI don't like the shift in status, but continue.\n\n48:26.240 --> 48:28.680\nRegained by calling it out.\n\n48:28.680 --> 48:30.440\nYes, now I'm on top again.\n\n48:30.440 --> 48:31.800\nI am the meta-alpha.\n\n48:31.800 --> 48:33.120\nI love your meta-alpha.\n\n48:33.120 --> 48:34.920\nGolden Corral is a compliment, though, right?\n\n48:34.920 --> 48:35.680\nYeah, he's just that.\n\n48:35.680 --> 48:36.680\nI don't remember.\n\n48:36.680 --> 48:38.400\nIt kind of sounds like a fat joke.\n\n48:38.400 --> 48:41.840\nI mean it that you live life and you eat and you're fat.\n\n48:41.840 --> 48:44.480\nIt was a good.\n\n48:44.480 --> 48:47.960\nBut good save.\n\n48:47.960 --> 48:49.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:52.600\nBut I mean, at the buffet of life, you're getting second.\n\n48:52.600 --> 48:54.760\nThat's what I did.\n\n48:54.760 --> 48:56.480\nYou're the good kind of fat.\n\n48:56.480 --> 48:57.480\nOh!\n\n48:57.480 --> 49:00.480\nAll right.\n\n49:00.480 --> 49:03.480\nThat's why you're solid.\n\n49:03.480 --> 49:04.480\nEveryone's dancing.\n\n49:04.480 --> 49:07.480\nSolid as a rock.\n\n49:07.480 --> 49:08.480\nSpanking.\n\n49:08.480 --> 49:10.480\nAnd no loud changes.\n\n49:10.480 --> 49:11.480\nDancing.\n\n49:11.480 --> 49:12.480\nWow.\n\n49:12.480 --> 49:13.480\nI too.\n\n49:13.480 --> 49:18.480\nThis just got written up on Splitsider.\n\n49:18.480 --> 49:19.480\nI don't know.\n\n49:19.480 --> 49:25.480\nIs there any room anymore for, could we ever make that?\n\n49:25.480 --> 49:30.200\nIs there anything a comedy podcast could do these days that would actually like end up\n\n49:30.200 --> 49:36.480\nin anyone's Apple news update with a headline that said, Pete Holmes just, like I said.\n\n49:36.480 --> 49:37.480\nNothing good.\n\n49:37.480 --> 49:38.480\nThe word just is.\n\n49:38.480 --> 49:39.480\nYeah.\n\n49:39.480 --> 49:47.480\nAnd someone just did this and it was epic and you'll come your brain into your dick\n\n49:47.480 --> 49:48.480\nnose.\n\n49:48.480 --> 49:50.480\nYeah, I know.\n\n49:50.480 --> 49:56.880\nJust this, normally newspapers would just be like, a guy does a thing that you don't\n\n49:56.880 --> 49:57.880\ncare about.\n\n49:57.880 --> 50:02.280\nSo it's on page four and it's all part of, that's why it's called a paper.\n\n50:02.280 --> 50:08.680\nAnd now everything is just like, just, just, someone just, this just, epic just.\n\n50:08.680 --> 50:09.680\nThis just happened.\n\n50:09.680 --> 50:14.280\nJust, I can't, but you won't believe epic just.\n\n50:14.280 --> 50:23.400\nBut a lot of it is just like, like, Tom Hanks's uncle just decided he's a DJ and it's only\n\n50:23.400 --> 50:28.180\nbecause actually that sounds, actually that's the bad example that is, that's great.\n\n50:28.180 --> 50:32.360\nThat is a headline that I would, that's perfect.\n\n50:32.360 --> 50:33.360\nWhat I was going to say.\n\n50:33.360 --> 50:34.360\nAll right.\n\n50:34.360 --> 50:35.360\nYeah.\n\n50:35.360 --> 50:36.360\nYou were, I didn't interrupt you.\n\n50:36.360 --> 50:37.360\nWhat I was going to say.\n\n50:37.360 --> 50:38.360\nNo, no, you didn't interrupt.\n\n50:38.360 --> 50:39.360\nGo ahead.\n\n50:39.360 --> 50:40.360\nYou're great.\n\n50:40.360 --> 50:41.360\nKeep talking.\n\n50:41.360 --> 50:45.760\nI think, I think you'll think this is interesting from showbiz, showbiz perspective.\n\n50:45.760 --> 50:51.760\nYou could have the best cartoon in the world, the, a single panel cartoon, perfectly drawn,\n\n50:51.760 --> 50:54.120\nperfect caption, funniest caption in the world.\n\n50:54.120 --> 50:58.280\nYou show it to anybody, any, 10 out of 10 people are going to shit their pants laughing\n\n50:58.280 --> 50:59.280\nat this cartoon.\n\n50:59.280 --> 51:00.720\nThey won't buy it.\n\n51:00.720 --> 51:05.800\nThe New Yorker has enough cartoons to never buy a cartoon again and they could run for\n\n51:05.800 --> 51:06.800\n50 years.\n\n51:06.800 --> 51:07.800\nShut up.\n\n51:07.800 --> 51:08.800\nI'm going to get your backlog.\n\n51:08.800 --> 51:09.800\nWait.\n\n51:09.800 --> 51:10.800\nSo they don't want cartoons.\n\n51:10.800 --> 51:11.800\nThey want cartoonists.\n\n51:11.800 --> 51:15.360\nSo I said, I went in every day for six, every week for six months.\n\n51:15.360 --> 51:18.120\nThat's hundreds of cartoons before they bought one.\n\n51:18.120 --> 51:22.280\nAnd that was even a Jack Ziegler rest in peace, one of the greats of the New Yorker put in\n\n51:22.280 --> 51:25.800\na good word for me because I'm that kind of guy that'll go up to somebody and be like,\n\n51:25.800 --> 51:28.600\nhey, I'm new in town, help me.\n\n51:28.600 --> 51:30.400\nI'm a John Mulaney spiritual.\n\n51:30.400 --> 51:31.800\nI have a thousand questions.\n\n51:31.800 --> 51:35.040\nI don't, do they buy them or do they not?\n\n51:35.040 --> 51:36.040\nAre you saying?\n\n51:36.040 --> 51:37.040\nNo, they'll bank some of them.\n\n51:37.040 --> 51:40.200\nThey'll create an industry of everyone's always auditioning.\n\n51:40.200 --> 51:42.680\nSo their supply never runs out and they don't have to pay for it.\n\n51:42.680 --> 51:43.680\nThat's what you're saying.\n\n51:43.680 --> 51:44.680\nNo, no, no.\n\n51:44.680 --> 51:45.680\nIt's like wire image.\n\n51:45.680 --> 51:48.920\nThere's a bank of all these photos and if they want to use one eventually.\n\n51:48.920 --> 51:50.480\nBut they do pay for it.\n\n51:50.480 --> 51:52.440\nThey pay when they use them or they pay them?\n\n51:52.440 --> 51:55.120\nNo, they buy it and then they own it.\n\n51:55.120 --> 51:56.960\nAnd for the most part, they run them.\n\n51:56.960 --> 52:00.600\nBut like, let's say you're an on salary cartoonist.\n\n52:00.600 --> 52:04.080\nYou give me 300 cartoons, maybe we run 250 of them.\n\n52:04.080 --> 52:07.440\nEvery year, we're getting 50 of your cartoons on the backlog and that's been happening since\n\n52:07.440 --> 52:09.240\nlike 1909 when the magazine.\n\n52:09.240 --> 52:10.240\nOkay.\n\n52:10.240 --> 52:20.000\nSo when all the cartoons were like, racist with the New Yorker was like, but you said\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.760\nyou have like four cartoons published.\n\n52:22.760 --> 52:23.760\nYeah.\n\n52:23.760 --> 52:24.760\nAnd they published all of them.\n\n52:24.760 --> 52:25.760\nYeah.\n\n52:25.760 --> 52:26.760\nSo are you bragging?\n\n52:26.760 --> 52:27.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n52:27.760 --> 52:33.800\nBecause you didn't have to do like five, I think it's more of the salary guys that might\n\n52:33.800 --> 52:34.800\nget archived.\n\n52:34.800 --> 52:35.800\nBut they have these meetings.\n\n52:35.800 --> 52:36.800\nI'm sorry.\n\n52:36.800 --> 52:37.800\nI'm asking so many questions about this.\n\n52:37.800 --> 52:38.800\nIt's a podcast.\n\n52:38.800 --> 52:39.800\nWhat is this?\n\n52:39.800 --> 52:40.800\nA podcast?\n\n52:40.800 --> 52:46.040\nIt's just like, Pete Holmes just redefined podcast.\n\n52:46.040 --> 52:49.800\nThis meeting that you're describing where they go like they open the doors and you're\n\n52:49.800 --> 52:53.800\nlike, you could go to CondÃ© Nast and you show up and the people like come in and trench\n\n52:53.800 --> 52:57.520\ncoats with like these books and go like, well, here's a guy fishing for a shark, but it's\n\n52:57.520 --> 52:59.400\nlike Wall Street and like, right.\n\n52:59.400 --> 53:03.440\nLike is everyone just showing cartoons and some of them have like doves on their shoulders\n\n53:03.440 --> 53:04.440\nand.\n\n53:04.440 --> 53:06.000\nWell, you're picturing it not entirely wrong.\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.280\nActually, there's a lot of like Connecticut train weirdos.\n\n53:08.280 --> 53:12.080\nI don't know why I said doves pigeons is Connecticut.\n\n53:12.080 --> 53:13.080\nConnecticut will take anything.\n\n53:13.080 --> 53:20.120\nI said, I said Connecticut train weirdos and he went now, Pete, did you ever want to be\n\n53:20.120 --> 53:24.560\nlike a syndicated comic strip guy like like have a syndicated thing across like major\n\n53:24.560 --> 53:25.560\npapers across.\n\n53:25.560 --> 53:28.720\nOh yeah, Calvin and Hobbes was a game change.\n\n53:28.720 --> 53:29.720\nLet's do it.\n\n53:29.720 --> 53:30.720\nLet's do a podcast first.\n\n53:30.720 --> 53:34.640\nCalvin provides a three panel comic strip.\n\n53:34.640 --> 53:35.640\nOkay.\n\n53:35.640 --> 53:38.080\nBut is it like a funny or is it a slice of life?\n\n53:38.080 --> 53:45.240\nWell, it's probably going to be the latter slice of because we have to so let's get let's\n\n53:45.240 --> 53:46.240\nget a title.\n\n53:46.240 --> 53:52.440\nThe title is good and butter good and butter good and butter.\n\n53:52.440 --> 53:53.680\nAll right.\n\n53:53.680 --> 54:00.600\nIt's because it's a husband and well, you can't say the name of it.\n\n54:00.600 --> 54:01.600\nDidn't tell me what it means.\n\n54:01.600 --> 54:02.600\nOh, well, no.\n\n54:02.600 --> 54:03.600\nOkay.\n\n54:03.600 --> 54:05.400\nI didn't I didn't mean I was I thought, okay, all right.\n\n54:05.400 --> 54:06.400\nI didn't mean to slap.\n\n54:06.400 --> 54:07.400\nNo, no, no.\n\n54:07.400 --> 54:08.400\nLet's find out why it's called good.\n\n54:08.400 --> 54:09.400\nBut we're doing the panel.\n\n54:09.400 --> 54:10.400\nHang on.\n\n54:10.400 --> 54:11.400\nAm I the third panel?\n\n54:11.400 --> 54:12.400\nAre you guys going to do?\n\n54:12.400 --> 54:14.200\nI thought we explained what's in each panel.\n\n54:14.200 --> 54:20.280\nOh, no, no, no, here's the here's the rules to this new improv game that I made that if\n\n54:20.280 --> 54:23.520\nanybody uses they owe me money.\n\n54:23.520 --> 54:25.800\nThat's how improv is.\n\n54:25.800 --> 54:30.000\nThat's how they all made their millions because it goes from I'm rich off inventing freeze\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:31.000\ntech.\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:34.760\nIt goes from audience left to audience right.\n\n54:34.760 --> 54:38.640\nBy the time you run out of stage space, you're out of comic panel, right?\n\n54:38.640 --> 54:40.800\nYou get to do one line.\n\n54:40.800 --> 54:46.480\nAnd then if there's someone you're talking to, you do a line.\n\n54:46.480 --> 54:47.800\nAnd so it's like hieroglyphic.\n\n54:47.800 --> 54:51.920\nThere's no so so I say like, I get it.\n\n54:51.920 --> 54:55.680\nHey, I'm almost done with that lawnmower, right?\n\n54:55.680 --> 55:01.840\nAnd then I would be like, well, it took you all day to mow the damn grass.\n\n55:01.840 --> 55:07.400\nAnd then you and then you'd like draw a line and then now it's on me.\n\n55:07.400 --> 55:09.560\nThis is panel two now.\n\n55:09.560 --> 55:10.560\nThat's the tough part.\n\n55:10.560 --> 55:12.560\nLet's workshop that later.\n\n55:12.560 --> 55:30.680\nAnd then I'd go, listen, I've been noticing that you want me to work faster when I use\n\n55:30.680 --> 55:38.720\nyour property.\n\n55:38.720 --> 55:45.720\nAre you telling the truth?\n\n55:45.720 --> 55:52.720\nIt's a way and then it's a way I am in the Trump administration that you don't and you\n\n55:52.720 --> 55:53.720\ndon't have to do anything.\n\n55:53.720 --> 55:54.720\nThen we did it.\n\n55:54.720 --> 55:55.720\nWe did it.\n\n55:55.720 --> 55:56.720\nI don't know.\n\n55:56.720 --> 55:57.720\nAll right.\n\n55:57.720 --> 55:58.720\nNo.\n\n55:58.720 --> 55:59.720\nAll right.\n\n55:59.720 --> 56:00.720\nAll right.\n\n56:00.720 --> 56:01.720\nI liked it.\n\n56:01.720 --> 56:02.720\nYeah.\n\n56:02.720 --> 56:03.720\nOtherwise it'd be hanging.\n\n56:03.720 --> 56:04.720\nYou have to dry, right?\n\n56:04.720 --> 56:07.560\nIf I was like, you tell me and then you'd be like, what the fuck am I going to say you're\n\n56:07.560 --> 56:08.560\ntelling Fertilizer?\n\n56:08.560 --> 56:09.560\nOh.\n\n56:09.560 --> 56:10.560\nAll right.\n\n56:10.560 --> 56:19.120\nWell, no, no, no, it wasn't good, but I had a backup plan like pulling out when you're\n\n56:19.120 --> 56:20.120\non the pill.\n\n56:20.120 --> 56:21.120\nYeah.\n\n56:21.120 --> 56:22.120\nYeah.\n\n56:22.120 --> 56:26.560\nThat that was early good and butter, but do some of my favorite ones do some of my my\n\n56:26.560 --> 56:27.560\nclassic classic.\n\n56:27.560 --> 56:29.600\nCan I ask a podcast question?\n\n56:29.600 --> 56:30.600\nYeah.\n\n56:30.600 --> 56:31.600\nYeah.\n\n56:31.600 --> 56:34.960\nIs there usually this much improv?\n\n56:34.960 --> 56:35.960\nIt depends.\n\n56:35.960 --> 56:38.760\nCome out talking shit about your UCB training.\n\n56:38.760 --> 56:42.680\nNo, we should we should get to the scripted part of the show.\n\n56:42.680 --> 56:43.680\nYou're right.\n\n56:43.680 --> 56:44.680\nYou're right.\n\n56:44.680 --> 56:50.760\nSo Pete, I hear Blue Apron is the secret to your comedic success.\n\n56:50.760 --> 56:51.760\nIs that your sponsor?\n\n56:51.760 --> 56:52.760\nOh, yeah.\n\n56:52.760 --> 56:57.960\nWe love the caramelized pearl onions with peas cabbage.\n\n56:57.960 --> 57:04.680\nDid season three of crashing go so much good because you like the way you like them?\n\n57:04.680 --> 57:06.920\nLike the way people order Blue Apron?\n\n57:06.920 --> 57:11.560\nWell, what we do on crashing is we write a script and then we wrap it in that sounds\n\n57:11.560 --> 57:15.480\ngreat.\n\n57:15.480 --> 57:20.400\nIs it true they can get a discount if they use the code Pete Holmes dot Blue Apron dot\n\n57:20.400 --> 57:21.400\nslash.\n\n57:21.400 --> 57:23.320\nI don't think that'll do anything.\n\n57:23.320 --> 57:24.320\nOh, yeah.\n\n57:24.320 --> 57:28.000\nNo, that sounds that sounds like it'll it'll take your web browser to something.\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:32.040\nBlue Apron, eat your guilt about all that packaging away.\n\n57:32.040 --> 57:35.320\nFeel free to edit that out.\n\n57:35.320 --> 57:36.600\nI know what it's like having sponsored.\n\n57:36.600 --> 57:37.600\nHere's a real question.\n\n57:37.600 --> 57:44.400\nI wanted to ask you because you just had a two year old two month old to me.\n\n57:44.400 --> 57:47.760\nTo me, babies are no younger than two years old.\n\n57:47.760 --> 57:49.680\nYou just had a two year old.\n\n57:49.680 --> 57:50.680\nYou're picturing it, right?\n\n57:50.680 --> 57:51.680\nYou have a two month old.\n\n57:51.680 --> 57:52.680\nYeah.\n\n57:52.680 --> 57:53.680\nTwo months.\n\n57:53.680 --> 57:55.400\nFresh fresh as the fucking morning bread.\n\n57:55.400 --> 57:56.400\nWhere was she?\n\n57:56.400 --> 58:01.240\nYou're like, but I assume I haven't watched your show.\n\n58:01.240 --> 58:06.560\nIt sounds from the description that it's probably every television show ever made in\n\n58:06.560 --> 58:08.960\nthat it's not you.\n\n58:08.960 --> 58:17.360\nIs it you doing stand up and it's it's the Mindy project, but you're a white dude.\n\n58:17.360 --> 58:19.000\nI'm just making a guess.\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:26.560\nWe please put that on the DVD box like the Mindy project, but I'm a white dude and he's\n\n58:26.560 --> 58:27.560\nnot a doctor.\n\n58:27.560 --> 58:33.440\nI also can't quite figure it out.\n\n58:33.440 --> 58:37.400\nLet me rephrase that.\n\n58:37.400 --> 58:41.400\nIs your show about a single dude finding life and love in a coastal city?\n\n58:41.400 --> 58:45.400\nOr is it your show about a dude who's already married and in either case, I have another\n\n58:45.400 --> 58:46.400\nquestion.\n\n58:46.400 --> 58:47.400\nYeah.\n\n58:47.400 --> 58:54.400\nIt was like disturbing how you kind of summarized all of TV just then because it's fair.\n\n58:54.400 --> 58:55.400\nYeah.\n\n58:55.400 --> 58:56.800\nNo, it's a guy who was married.\n\n58:56.800 --> 58:57.800\nIt's based on me.\n\n58:57.800 --> 58:58.800\nI was married.\n\n58:58.800 --> 59:04.520\nWhen I was 28, my wife had an affair with a small Italian man named Rocco, which is a\n\n59:04.520 --> 59:06.800\nname you said earlier.\n\n59:06.800 --> 59:07.800\nRocco Safridi.\n\n59:07.800 --> 59:08.800\nYeah.\n\n59:08.800 --> 59:09.800\nAs a porno name.\n\n59:09.800 --> 59:10.800\nYeah.\n\n59:10.800 --> 59:11.800\nAnd big boobs, booby boobs or whatever.\n\n59:11.800 --> 59:12.800\nYeah.\n\n59:12.800 --> 59:13.800\nCause I didn't cause the turnover rate with.\n\n59:13.800 --> 59:14.800\nIt was something.\n\n59:14.800 --> 59:15.800\nSomething boobs a lot.\n\n59:15.800 --> 59:16.800\nI know that.\n\n59:16.800 --> 59:18.800\nLet's go all the way back round the corner.\n\n59:18.800 --> 59:22.800\nFudge is made by me three.\n\n59:22.800 --> 59:23.800\nOkay.\n\n59:23.800 --> 59:26.800\nYour first wife left you for a fellow named Rocco.\n\n59:26.800 --> 59:27.800\nYeah.\n\n59:27.800 --> 59:28.800\nYeah.\n\n59:28.800 --> 59:29.800\nYeah.\n\n59:29.800 --> 59:30.800\nYeah.\n\n59:30.800 --> 59:31.800\nRocco.\n\n59:31.800 --> 59:32.800\nNice guy actually.\n\n59:32.800 --> 59:33.800\nI'm not just saying that.\n\n59:33.800 --> 59:34.800\nHe was a really sweet guy.\n\n59:34.800 --> 59:35.800\nI really like him.\n\n59:35.800 --> 59:38.800\nSo the show is kind of a flashback to a portrait of you.\n\n59:38.800 --> 59:39.800\nYes.\n\n59:39.800 --> 59:40.800\nAnd you were single.\n\n59:40.800 --> 59:41.800\nYou know, it's funny.\n\n59:41.800 --> 59:45.200\nA lot of TV and movies start with an affair.\n\n59:45.200 --> 59:50.480\nOur pilot has an affair, but I mean, you know, we talked about Joey Kams, Joseph Campbell.\n\n59:50.480 --> 59:55.240\nWe need that inciting thing and in my case, my life really had that thing.\n\n59:55.240 --> 59:57.560\nI was in the shallow end of comedy.\n\n59:57.560 --> 01:00:02.040\nMy wife leaves everything that I knew fell away and then I was like sort of forced into\n\n01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.800\nthe deep end and the concede is there are all these Obi-Wan type characters like Artie\n\n01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:13.040\nLang, Bill Burr, Sarah Silverman that sort of shepherd me and teach me because they think\n\n01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.040\nit's sweet.\n\n01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.080\nA lot of people thought I was like a sweetie and they were like, isn't it, look at this\n\n01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:22.720\nmusical and he's religious and he's sweeter than the scene, we're going to help him out.\n\n01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.720\nThat actually happened quite a bit.\n\n01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.960\nAnd so it's kind of like, but you're currently, you're partners with this person and now you've\n\n01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.120\ncreated a life as of two months ago.\n\n01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:39.320\nMy question has to do with having a successful show that's going to keep on running and now\n\n01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:46.280\nas creators, our big fantasy is like, write what you know, write what you know and then\n\n01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:51.440\nyou create this thing and it's like, it's about us and it's about me and all this stuff.\n\n01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:57.960\nMy question is always, how do you cope with that three seasons into it when you're now\n\n01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:05.560\ncoming home to a California king's eyes bed with a person who is like, what is the relationship\n\n01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:11.760\nbetween you and your partner with the show?\n\n01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:18.080\nWhen the show is about you, is it about, it's about you being single, right?\n\n01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.080\nThe show.\n\n01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:23.920\nThe show is not about you being married, the show is about you dating, right?\n\n01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.120\nI'm asking because I don't know.\n\n01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.120\nI feel like...\n\n01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.120\nWhoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.360\nGolden corral, take it easy.\n\n01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.920\nI'm confirming that first of all.\n\n01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.400\nAnd then my question is like, does that cause, is it like, how does that work?\n\n01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.800\nI think I hear you.\n\n01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.240\nI think I hear you.\n\n01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:50.720\nMy show, my wife, my new wife, but Valerie, we've been married for almost a year now.\n\n01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.760\nWe've been together for over five, six years and we have the baby and I'm currently making\n\n01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.360\na show reenacting my old marriage.\n\n01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:05.080\nAnd then also the girl, the woman who's one of our best friends as a couple, Jamie Lee,\n\n01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.720\nwho plays my girlfriend on the show is actually my ex-girlfriend.\n\n01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.000\nSo when we talk about how spectacular and loving Valerie is, it's not that I'm just\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.560\nlike making believe of the past with actors, I'm actually making believe of the past with\n\n01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560\nmy ex-girlfriend.\n\n01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.160\nSo she's tremendous.\n\n01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.600\nShe's actually winning an Emmy this year, the support of wife Emmy.\n\n01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600\nIs that what you meant?\n\n01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:32.200\nI kind of, but now I have eight more questions because like, wait, did you, is your ex-girlfriend...\n\n01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.720\nDid that, do you think that answered his question?\n\n01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.840\nNo, because didn't you...\n\n01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.320\nHe didn't act like you were clear on his question.\n\n01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:48.320\nI listened to people for a living and that was like a tour through a Walmart that sold\n\n01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:57.080\nwords, but there was an earthquake.\n\n01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:04.040\nI want to separate it from like, if I wanted to be like a thoughtful interviewer, I would\n\n01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.680\nhave watched the show and be like, no, but what do you think?\n\n01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.680\nDon't feel that way.\n\n01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:14.800\nI'm saying as a creator who I assume, like you're doing a show, is the character named\n\n01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.200\nPete?\n\n01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.800\nSo is he a stand-up?\n\n01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.040\nSo that's my question is like, we all do that.\n\n01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.040\nWe tell...\n\n01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.480\nDoes he jerk off to his grandpa?\n\n01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.480\nThat was him.\n\n01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.480\nOkay.\n\n01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:36.160\nAnd my question, I think you kind of, you could talk about this for more is like...\n\n01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.160\nThe more you drink, the more you sound like Robert Crumb.\n\n01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:45.280\nYou can talk about this for a lot of comics.\n\n01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:50.960\nIs that, just that general area, I don't have the smart question about it because I haven't\n\n01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.960\nseen the show or...\n\n01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.960\nYou're doing wonderful.\n\n01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.960\nYou can ask me anything.\n\n01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.960\nWe're friends.\n\n01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.960\nDon't patronize me.\n\n01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.360\nI'm a good interviewer.\n\n01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.480\nYou're doing great.\n\n01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:10.880\nIt's just curious about your personal and if I'm prying, then you just go, don't pry,\n\n01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:18.560\nbut having a partner in your life, and you go, like, I've known, it's like 50 comics\n\n01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.920\nwho like every, so it's like my show is called Franklin.\n\n01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.920\nWhat's the show about?\n\n01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.120\nWell, it's about the fact that I'm Franklin and their name is Franklin.\n\n01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.680\nAnd it's like, well, it's about growing up in the Bronx and being married to something.\n\n01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.360\nAnd it's like, well, okay, so a lot of that is obviously based on the things you talked\n\n01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:41.400\nabout in your act, and therefore now that's based on your life, and that's my curiosity\n\n01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:48.160\nis these conversations that have to happen when you come home from work or you watch\n\n01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:56.320\nsomething together and the challenges that your partner goes through where they're like,\n\n01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:02.040\nis that about me, or is that about your cousin Amy, or what's going on here?\n\n01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.040\nOr is that real?\n\n01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.040\nYeah.\n\n01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.040\nDid that happen?\n\n01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.040\nDo you feel that way?\n\n01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:13.600\nYeah, I suppose the whole process, if I'm hearing you correctly, Pete, it was a yes\n\n01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.600\nor no question.\n\n01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.600\nAll right.\n\n01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.600\nAll right.\n\n01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600\nWell.\n\n01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:25.200\nI feel like I could answer in the style in which I was asked.\n\n01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:32.320\nYou know, when you're making a show like this that is oftentimes autobiographical, but not\n\n01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:36.960\nwithout its fiction, you know, you take deviations into different roads and the roads become\n\n01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.720\navenues and some of them become cul-de-sacs and send you back the way you came.\n\n01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.800\nBut when you're looking over that hill and there's somebody like your partner and they're\n\n01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.280\nwondering, is this like, is this something we watch together?\n\n01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:53.760\nIs this something like the Sopranos where we cook a meal and eat the meal and we watch\n\n01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.760\nit?\n\n01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:00.320\nOr is it more like a theme show or a barbecue kind of night off of nudity?\n\n01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:05.880\nAnd why do you keep coming in this wood chipper?\n\n01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:11.480\nThat's the best impression of me that I've always wanted.\n\n01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.320\nI'm like, James Adomian, will you ever do an impression of me?\n\n01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.720\nIt's like, no, I would never dirty my hands with that.\n\n01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.840\nThat was the first impression I would have made of me, and that was fantastic.\n\n01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:20.840\nIs that right?\n\n01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.840\nSomebody sent me a clip of someone, was it you?\n\n01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.560\nIt's fine if it was, doing an impression of me on this podcast.\n\n01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.560\nI don't think so.\n\n01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560\nAny die-hard fans remember that?\n\n01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.720\nIf I did an impression of you, it would be like, I'm a great guy.\n\n01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.640\nIt was very sweet, actually.\n\n01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.640\nIt was somebody...\n\n01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.480\nDo you want a vegan cookie?\n\n01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.600\nI have a show on HBO.\n\n01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.360\nHey, it's me.\n\n01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.360\nIt's me.\n\n01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.720\nI'm Pete Holmes.\n\n01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:51.480\nIf I don't seem very dimensionalized, it might be because you have clinical narcissism.\n\n01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.360\nMaybe you don't see anybody as so human.\n\n01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.840\nOh, that's so fun.\n\n01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.280\nMaybe everyone's a color for him, do you?\n\n01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.680\nThat is brutally honest.\n\n01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.400\nThe first time I met you, I think, we were doing Douglas movies at the UCB, and it was\n\n01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.920\nme, you, and Bill Burr.\n\n01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.920\nAnd I'd never met you.\n\n01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.000\nThat's my Bill Burr impression.\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nThat's really good.\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.720\nNo, no, I'm serious.\n\n01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.440\nI don't watch any current movies.\n\n01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.440\nMy knowledge of movies is way old, so I'm not going to be good at it.\n\n01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.920\nAnd Doug is smoking weed in the back, of course.\n\n01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.680\nSuspend your disbelief for that part.\n\n01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.640\nAnd I sit down and I meet Bill Burr.\n\n01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.640\nI'm like, oh, hey, Bill.\n\n01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.640\nAnd he goes, I'm Jeff.\n\n01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.200\nHe goes, hey, how's it going?\n\n01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.140\nAnd I go, he goes, hey, Jeff, we're doing a show at Pete Holmes, so you and I are never\n\n01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:45.640\ngoing to talk.\n\n01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640\nAnd that's about right.\n\n01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.840\nBut the thing was, it was the best thing in the world, because I don't know anything about\n\n01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.560\nmovies, like what's currently in theaters.\n\n01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.560\nMe either do I.\n\n01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.600\nBut you just got up and just completely dominated the whole thing.\n\n01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.800\nI don't want to get to the game.\n\n01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.800\nMe neither.\n\n01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.800\nYeah.\n\n01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.640\nBut you took me, I didn't have to play the game, and my gift to the audience member\n\n01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:07.720\nwas a flask full of really nice whiskey, and that was my offer to whoever voted for\n\n01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.720\nme at the end of the thing.\n\n01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:09.720\nOh, that's fine.\n\n01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:10.720\nWhile you were talking.\n\n01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.720\nDid they get to keep the flask?\n\n01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.200\nNo, because while you were talking, Bill and I just opened it up and drank the entire\n\n01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.200\nthing.\n\n01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.200\nYeah.\n\n01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.200\nI remember that.\n\n01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:23.200\nI got a little drunk that show too, and afterwards Bill went, yeah, you had a little too much\n\n01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.720\nJesus juice.\n\n01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.720\nThat's what he said.\n\n01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.720\nYeah.\n\n01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.360\nI call that a threshold guardian.\n\n01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.840\nThat's what Joseph Campbell would call it.\n\n01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.880\nWait, did you call him Joey Camps earlier?\n\n01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.880\nJoey Camps.\n\n01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.880\nJoey Camps.\n\n01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.880\nYeah, Joey Camps.\n\n01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880\nYeah.\n\n01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.880\nJoey Camps.\n\n01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:40.880\nChange my life, Joey Camps.\n\n01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.880\nThat's what we had the chat about.\n\n01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.880\nI prefer my Pete Holmes.\n\n01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.880\nI don't think you talk too much at all.\n\n01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.220\nI think you talk just enough.\n\n01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.220\nThat's very sweet.\n\n01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.920\nAnd when I do Doug Loves movies, kind of like what you were actually asking me about crashing,\n\n01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.920\nI think.\n\n01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:57.600\nThere is a depersonalizing element of you become like, that's TV me, and this is me, me.\n\n01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.480\nSimilarly on Doug Loves movies, that's Doug Loves movies me.\n\n01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.120\nWe all have these different modes.\n\n01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.640\nThere's Thanksgiving you, there's a loan on the subway you, there's drunk at a party\n\n01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.640\nyou.\n\n01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.640\nIn fact, maybe you'll relate to this.\n\n01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.800\nOne of the reasons I don't like going to parties and getting stoned or whatever is because\n\n01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.600\nI'm not that crazy about my personality.\n\n01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:20.560\nI love it, don't get me wrong, but I'll also come home and I'll be like, I told too many\n\n01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.560\nstories.\n\n01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.560\nRight.\n\n01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:26.040\nOr maybe you joke off who you are, right?\n\n01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.120\nI'll just say to Valence, this is why I like to keep it at home.\n\n01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.120\nYeah.\n\n01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.400\nDan and I, we've been doing this podcast for four million episodes and we've told the\n\n01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.600\nsame seven stories a hundred thousand times.\n\n01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.600\nFor sure, yeah.\n\n01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.600\nYeah.\n\n01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.600\nWell, that's why, you know, good entertainer.\n\n01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.200\nGood to know when to, but bad at a party.\n\n01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.200\nNo, but we don't.\n\n01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.720\nYou would have thought we would have learned that a long time ago.\n\n01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.120\nI keep telling the same five.\n\n01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.880\nNo, we always forget right when we should, right when we're about to repeat the first\n\n01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.880\nstory.\n\n01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.880\nWe forget.\n\n01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.880\nNo, I understand that.\n\n01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:58.480\nI sometimes worry on my podcast because we've done, I don't know, almost 400 episodes.\n\n01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.640\nThere's anyone listening?\n\n01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.720\nI mean, you could give me, you could give me feedback.\n\n01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.280\nI won't take it personally.\n\n01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.520\nDo you go like, he's going to tell them.\n\n01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.040\nHe's about to do that story.\n\n01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040\nRight?\n\n01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040\nI mean, I do too.\n\n01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:18.400\nI'm also there and I'm like, wow, it's like AI could make me from the podcast.\n\n01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.200\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.200\nIf you say this, he's going to say that.\n\n01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.960\nThis is, let's talk about that.\n\n01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960\nThat's what I'm here.\n\n01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.240\nThat's what you just said about the party thing, like go to, like, why would I go to\n\n01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.720\na party and then you sit there and like, who are you?\n\n01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.440\nLike, just.\n\n01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:39.440\nWhich you.\n\n01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:45.760\nDo you constantly wonder that and do quote unquote normal people constantly wonder that\n\n01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:53.320\nI keep playing a Hail Mary where I think I'm pretty sure quote unquote normal people,\n\n01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.120\nAKA the people listening.\n\n01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120\nAlthough don't be so sure.\n\n01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.120\nI used to be exclusionary in my language and I was like comedians are like this or creative\n\n01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120\npeople are like this.\n\n01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.960\nNow I'm sure most of these people here can relate to this feeling.\n\n01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:12.720\nI just said that and you're high-roading me.\n\n01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:20.400\nI made that exception and I'm like, I'm saying like, I think that Pete, I'm hearing, I'm\n\n01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.400\nlistening.\n\n01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.200\nWell, I'm unclear.\n\n01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.200\nDeal with it.\n\n01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.200\nThat's the point of the show.\n\n01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.200\nI'm unclear.\n\n01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.200\nThat is beautiful.\n\n01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.200\nYou can be unclear.\n\n01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.200\nIt's not beautiful.\n\n01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:44.960\nNo, no, God damn your UCB training.\n\n01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:50.080\nNo, but that that was what I was trying to express.\n\n01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.120\nIs that like, like, oh, I look like God damn it.\n\n01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.120\nNo, I can't.\n\n01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:59.680\nNow I keep hearing your impression of me and I'm afraid to start, but but but God damn\n\n01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.680\nit.\n\n01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.680\nYeah.\n\n01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.440\nNo, I do most people wonder who they are.\n\n01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.280\nDo you think like regular jokes?\n\n01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.400\nDoes everyone basically essentially not know who they are?\n\n01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.600\nI don't think so.\n\n01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600\nI think that's a no.\n\n01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.600\nThey don't or yes, they know they don't.\n\n01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.400\nI wonder.\n\n01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.680\nI have some friends where I'm just like, no, that guy's just fucking like, I'm Ted.\n\n01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.680\nAnd he knows.\n\n01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:22.680\nAnd he knows.\n\n01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.680\nAnd he knows.\n\n01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.680\nAnd we love.\n\n01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.680\nAnd we love Ted.\n\n01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.200\nTed dies in a skiing accident.\n\n01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.520\nAnd then everyone's like, like there are good teds and bad teds like Ted Bundy.\n\n01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:37.200\nAnd then Ted, the stuff that was a good ten, like, like, like, sometimes it's like, oh,\n\n01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.280\nthat's why Ted, like shot that kid.\n\n01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.800\nI like it just feels like they just kind of switch automatically where if we got to go\n\n01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:44.800\nwait a second.\n\n01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.640\nI'm going into a mall.\n\n01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.440\nOkay, mall got it.\n\n01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.440\nIt's very basic.\n\n01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.440\nOther people just do it.\n\n01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.400\nThey're like, yeah, I'm Ted.\n\n01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400\nHere we go.\n\n01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.400\nTed in the mall.\n\n01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400\nLike it.\n\n01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.400\nYeah, I love that every once in a while.\n\n01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.400\nSleepy Martin star.\n\n01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.680\nYeah, that's very flatter.\n\n01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.680\nIt is.\n\n01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.840\nBecause it means you how much weight you've lost.\n\n01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.840\nOh man.\n\n01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.840\nYeah, you agree.\n\n01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:16.480\nI would say like homeless fat guy from Game of Thrones or homeless fat guy from Lost.\n\n01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480\nI mean Martin star.\n\n01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.480\nAll of that way.\n\n01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.480\nThat's a man.\n\n01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.480\nThat's a thin man.\n\n01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.000\nHe's actually here.\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nSpencer.\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nSo you're saying.\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.560\nI think we can probably all relate to that.\n\n01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.480\nLike if you're going, okay, I'm going into a Fourth of July party.\n\n01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.680\nI got to be Fourth of July party Spencer.\n\n01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.480\nWell, that's what I thought he was mentioning is that it's like, oh yeah, we're different\n\n01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.800\npeople in different situations, you know, we kind of we act differently depending on\n\n01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.640\nwho we're around and isn't Dan saying though underneath that we're going, but who am I\n\n01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.640\nreally?\n\n01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.640\nRight?\n\n01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.640\nYeah.\n\n01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.640\nI don't think Ted is going.\n\n01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.640\nBut who's Ted?\n\n01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.640\nReally?\n\n01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640\nYes.\n\n01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.640\nThat's yeah.\n\n01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.640\nThere are some people who are like, well, one thing.\n\n01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.640\nI know sure.\n\n01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640\nI'm Ted.\n\n01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.640\nI know these people.\n\n01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:05.080\nWe all do around the time we hear these people are going, we wish you a Merry Christmas.\n\n01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.000\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas and they're just like, they're just in they don't they\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000\ndon't think how does this look they're just like now bring a stuff to keep holding there\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.160\nin but but but but but some of the people doing that are are are us yeah and are going\n\n01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:24.000\nto America and they're and they're like fucking I would lose Ted would like me.\n\n01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.880\nLike that's what complicate is like I think I think every double down I like I don't\n\n01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.280\nactually know Ted's are like a calming influence right now I can then I don't I don't know\n\n01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.760\nI actually prefer they're like just be a little bit racist.\n\n01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.240\nI think I think it helps.\n\n01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:44.840\nI think everything it keeps the braces out it helps on the road who do you keep an extra\n\n01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:51.960\neye on it keeps too many races from happening if you're a little bit racist oh my god there\n\n01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.520\nare probably people that are like being racist keeps too many races from happening.\n\n01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:01.880\nWhat are you going to do be all these super race racer because if like a seven times\n\n01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:09.920\nremoved like this person as it yeah I yeah we're all I know is I wake up on a bed.\n\n01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:17.160\nI don't want it to change then I go to work if anyone tries to change my bed fuck them\n\n01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:24.320\nlike yeah it's like they're like right we we call them ribosomes in biological yeah\n\n01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.840\nright they're like they maintain like they read the DNA I actually think that's brilliant\n\n01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.600\nI often think of people in terms of cells because we're all just kind of doing what\n\n01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.760\ncells do anyway like I'm just like one of those loud cells that's like floating around\n\n01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:42.640\njust going like can I bond with you yeah like and don't you think I don't you think on a\n\n01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:53.240\nplayground without a Ted yeah be cancer yes yeah I need a Ted and then I'd be like whatever\n\n01:15:53.240 --> 01:16:02.080\nyou say that's right I've got an HBO show president like we wouldn't know when to stop\n\n01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:08.280\nbut yeah heads go like what's with your shoes I heard those shoes aren't right yeah I'm\n\n01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:12.720\nwe're like fucking Ted's some Ted's like the white blood cells I just fucking regulate\n\n01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:19.760\nI don't know what they are Ted's are like we got a nose to make Ted's Ted's gotta wake\n\n01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.720\nup make that bed Ted's are mitigators that yeah it's some Ted's like like Joey cams\n\n01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:34.160\nsays that mythology has a dual function what one part of it is to teach kids to dream bigger\n\n01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:41.520\nand one part is to dream smaller like it basically is but it's like taking adolescence and natural\n\n01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:48.360\nanger their natural like desire to eat the fathers of the tribe and to direct it outward\n\n01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:54.920\nyeah what you do with like Star Wars movies and you go who what hey what you turn in 13\n\n01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:00.440\nyou thinking that maybe if you cut my head off you could be in charge of everything what\n\n01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:05.520\na crazy feeling you know Luke Skywalker felt like that but then he learned that Darth Vader\n\n01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:12.720\nlives in a spaceship help me make these weapons yeah that that's a big part of mythology and\n\n01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:18.440\na tribal level is like directing anger outward like get it get this radiation out of the\n\n01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:23.720\npower so it doesn't melt down and then the but then the other totally contradictory\n\n01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.400\npart is you're trying to actually make people proud of themselves you're trying to tell\n\n01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:35.840\npeople don't let the shielding around this nuclear power plant close us in and and so\n\n01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:41.840\nyou're encouraging radiation while trying to figure out how to get out into the world\n\n01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:45.320\na healthy steam release you know I'll tell you something beautiful I this whole time\n\n01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.840\nI was trying to remember who said it but unfortunately I can't remember his name but it's a Joseph\n\n01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:54.000\nCampbell scholar who's talking about there's all these like teen suicides and he's like\n\n01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.320\nwhat people need to realize is instead of like walking on a bridge and jumping off they\n\n01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.080\nneed to realize what part of them needs to die that they might continue to the other\n\n01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:11.120\nside well the whole thing otherwise they wouldn't well that says that's what a suit but mythology\n\n01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.680\naddresses youth angst and rage and anger and saying yeah fucking a you're right part of\n\n01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:22.440\nyou is going to die and part of you is going to be killed by you that's what all young\n\n01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:26.400\nmen yeah like when there's another part of you that goes forward and that's that's sometimes\n\n01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.360\nmissing especially from American stories that sometimes we're missing that second part yeah\n\n01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:37.240\nif you create a societal mechanism that says to kids you're either going to be a doctor\n\n01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:42.440\na lawyer or a thief and they don't want to be any of the three they're gonna you're gonna\n\n01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:48.840\nhave a higher suicide rate than if you say to a kid here are some things that people\n\n01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:54.720\nhave been doctors and lawyers and thieves however yeah also you could be a wizard you\n\n01:18:54.720 --> 01:19:00.680\ncould and part of you can be a wizard yeah I'm not even joking be a night or a wizard\n\n01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:10.600\nor a skywalker of either yeah or a neo all right you guys getting these references can\n\n01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:16.000\nyou choose to be a neo though doesn't neo kind of get thrust upon you was neo really the\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.240\none google it what is that I always see I would see that headline and never click on\n\n01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:29.400\nit like the reddit thing where I like have explained yeah I'm always like why I totally\n\n01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:35.400\naccept that maybe he isn't yeah okay well you see there is a second layer to the matrix\n\n01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.680\nthat's designed for you to think you've escaped from the matrix and think that you're the\n\n01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:45.720\none and save in the day but that's just part of the matrix wait no is that in the\n\n01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:50.120\nmatrix though because that there's so many more matrix series that are more interesting\n\n01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:56.840\nthan the matrix right and that sounds like one of those well well he uses powers presumably\n\n01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.200\nonce when he's technically out of the matrix and people are like yeah how could that yeah\n\n01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.440\npeople are like well how could that happen unless they're in the matrix and then that\n\n01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.560\nconspiracy theory yeah I think that's where that whole but they never answered that question\n\n01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:14.160\nthe second movie ends with why does he have powers in the in the real world and then the\n\n01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:20.840\nthird one when he just does right and that is the most disappointing I wrote my I don't\n\n01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:27.640\nwrite fan fiction but I had this I had this whole ending what was I was laughing I don't\n\n01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:34.120\nlike fan figure what what was that I was I was enjoying the idea of a different me that\n\n01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:41.600\nwrites fan fiction like it's a simpler life by candlelight but I had this whole thing\n\n01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.920\nwhere like I wanted I wanted Neo to be fighting agent Smith who they say is actually the one\n\n01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:55.440\nright to unplug himself like that's enlightenment agent Smith no no I wanted Neo to be in in\n\n01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.680\nhis inescapable position right where he needs to save Trinity or whoever but he's blocked\n\n01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:05.600\nin and he can't get out so he realizes that he's just an assimilation and Neo in the real\n\n01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:11.000\nworld unplugs himself plugs himself back in in a new place and saves the day that seemed\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.480\nlike a good model of enlightenment they're always just like in the first are you saying\n\n01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:19.200\nin the first movie in the third movie oh the third movie well that's what I'm saying I'm\n\n01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:24.040\ntrying to well yeah I know yeah I'm trying I'm saying like you're fixin a fucking duck\n\n01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:29.280\nhunt that went from the marsh to the parking lot of a like I I'm like I watched all three\n\n01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:33.720\nof them and I was like and the third one I'm like what the fuck what yeah that's why the\n\n01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:38.680\nPete Holmes fan fiction version yeah no I mean when he comes back he's in white why do people\n\n01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:45.920\nthink that it I honestly like I remember like he goes like awesome why do people think agent\n\n01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.040\nSmith is actually the one because he's the one that gets the matrix shut down well because\n\n01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:54.520\nthe real ending was so bad they were like well this can't be what it was we have to have\n\n01:21:54.520 --> 01:22:00.480\nbeen missing something what if agent Smith is the one then it's great yeah that's where\n\n01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:06.080\nall this stuff comes from it's like truly it all grows out of the ending being unsatisfying\n\n01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.320\nI say this with a lot of love it feels like some pastor is trying to like breathe life\n\n01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:16.400\ninto the Old Testament yeah they're like it is cool you guys yeah it kind of it it reminds\n\n01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:24.160\nme I've not to get political but the smart oh boy favorite smocking tweet of the I'm not\n\n01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:29.680\non Twitter so when I hear about something it means that it was fucking radioactive like\n\n01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:37.400\nI'm like did the president say smocking it radiated out to me and then I was like I'm\n\n01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:42.880\nnot on Twitter I'm gonna go on Twitter because I want to find I want to find the guy with\n\n01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:49.880\nthe most followers who tried to make hay out of this sunshine and I that guy who was like\n\n01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:59.640\nhey he's mocking you for believing in needing a smoking gun like hello I love that anyway\n\n01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:05.160\nthat is creative thinking but yeah like the mythology creating like you it's it's it's\n\n01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:11.720\nthe human storytelling it's apologetics yeah yeah no it is apologetics thank you Martin\n\n01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:22.560\nthank you hello Democrats he's smocking you the jokes on you it's it's not a story about\n\n01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:30.840\na targeted AI voting systems combined with smartphones resulting in a half literate president\n\n01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:39.880\nthat's not what this is about he's smocking you it's all a code I like that I like it when\n\n01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.840\npeople are like I genuinely non-ironically like it when people are like so into something\n\n01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:49.160\nthat they're like was that person being ironic or being no well I mean they're apologetics\n\n01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:55.480\nbut they're lying they're to themselves into they weren't doing a bit they were being sincere\n\n01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:59.040\nin their own they'll say that they were doing a bit in their memoirs for years from now\n\n01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:03.040\nI'm sure some of you love Phantom Menace right I'm not even joking I'm sure some of you found\n\n01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.080\naway Star Wars matters enough to you right right right that you're like no you need to\n\n01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:11.280\nsee it a few times like I didn't like the last Jedi and most people that did were like you\n\n01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:18.320\nneed to see it twice and I was like I'm not that all in it's like like I'm a one you\n\n01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:28.600\nget one try mr. Lucas I got I got fired from community at season four and then I the last\n\n01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:36.040\ntime I ever googled myself was like I can't wait to see how these people like they are\n\n01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:41.800\ngonna miss me and I like googled my name like Dan Harmon season four community and it was\n\n01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:48.680\nlike community just got better essentially but it was worse than that actually because\n\n01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.560\nthat would be such an inversion that I would be like oh I'm Jonathan Swift and you're all\n\n01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:58.200\nthe laputians it was like not that satisfying it was more relativistic it was like welcome\n\n01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:03.240\nto the fact that everything you ever held valuable was a lie because it was like oh I'm\n\n01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:08.040\nfishing for this Marlin and what you catch isn't the opposite of a Marlin what you catch\n\n01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:13.160\nis a Marlin boot like you catch it was just like people going like hey let's give it a\n\n01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:20.880\nchance at least that fucking piece of shit is gone and maybe maybe this season sucks\n\n01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:27.960\nbut doesn't all TV suck and was season three even that good and I was like it was the truth\n\n01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:37.480\nthat I didn't want it burnt like like that burns it hurts holy water shouldn't be burning\n\n01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:44.840\nyou know it shouldn't be burning you that's a bad sign just water you I mean you're that's\n\n01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:52.320\nyour privilege you can call it just regular water but it burns me it's a microaggression\n\n01:25:52.320 --> 01:26:01.520\nfor you to call it a non devil privilege check your non devil privilege man what what what\n\n01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:09.160\nhurts you like like like here's our new segment in Harmon Chowkow what hurts Pete Holm are\n\n01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:14.000\nyou are you happy Pete Holms are you coping with happiness or are you are you living\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:22.360\nin terror of shut your fucking phone off are you living in terror of like are you are you\n\n01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:31.160\naddicted to worrying are you just happy I go through peaks and valleys just like everybody\n\n01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:36.640\nI would say I'm content that I can

even remember what I\n\n01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:46.520\nwas there was a thing there was a thing behind my bit that was like I want I wanted to actually\n\n01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:55.600\nlike I wanted to Tom is dead you guys I can't remember what my actual thing well him dying\n\n01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:01.800\nmakes me sad yet there's a part of me that is appreciating just what it's like to sometimes\n\n01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:07.520\nbe sad yeah oh well no I think it was just like a certain like I know this is exaggeration\n\n01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:16.480\nbut if I like listen Pete HPO we fell back into the bit yeah like I well I remember what\n\n01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:26.200\nmy point was Tom's num Tom num's body is still warm you guys Pete we love Pete are you there\n\n01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:37.480\nPete it's me Marsha I own everything Pete are you there I'm breaking up but but but\n\n01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:43.480\nmy question is like what if they is there's something because we're talking about happiness\n\n01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:48.800\nI'm saying could anything rattle you could anything make you upset oh yeah I get rattled\n\n01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:56.960\nfor sure well then what then what do you do um I mean it sounds glib but I really do try\n\n01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:02.560\nto enjoy everything sometimes I'll say to Valerie like I'm just being angry for fun like oh\n\n01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:07.960\nlike I want to let her know that I haven't like lost control or something but it's fun\n\n01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:14.040\nto like rant or talk about he didn't get what you wanted or how sad you are how hurt you\n\n01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:18.960\nare what somebody owed you you know all this like fucking drama playing a character yeah\n\n01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:23.600\nit is and it sounds a little glib but I do try to look at it like a character I'm like\n\n01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:29.560\nlook at fucking Pete doing his Pete thing I wonder if Pete will ever get out of this\n\n01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:34.040\nJoseph Campbell talks about that he talks about like the idea of having one foot in\n\n01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:39.000\nand one foot out well that's that's a it is a very spiritual idea meaning it shows up\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.960\nin all of the myths like you're a rodeo clown you're like like oh look at me like I think\n\n01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:47.960\neverybody you know some of this is in addressed in my special dirty clean which airs this\n\n01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:55.720\nSaturday but I thank you I do think we all relate to the idea of like kind of being\n\n01:31:55.720 --> 01:32:01.800\nbehind our eyeballs like being consciousness and we know that but then this consciousness\n\n01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:07.000\nis sort of stuck in this in these molecules stuck in the shape of a human body and everybody's\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:14.960\nalways looking at you and going like hey there's a man and you go like oh man and and you sort\n\n01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:18.120\nof like you know this is an Alan Watts line he's like you're behind your eyeballs and\n\n01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:24.040\nthe rest just dangles sort of dangles down here and like this is a Pete Holmes line\n\n01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:29.880\nand you go like I want that Diet Coke send the arm and you like send give it to us and\n\n01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:38.120\nyou drink it so you are it's not really that woo woo or or strange to say you are consciousness\n\n01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:43.280\nI don't think that is a deeply religious do you ever do you ever have these moods they\n\n01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:48.720\nnever last more than 30 seconds but do you ever be honestly like you're walking around\n\n01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:59.400\nyou go like what if what if I was God what if what if let me finish what if everyone\n\n01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:04.600\nelse was also God yeah you know like and then do you ever like very long are you able to\n\n01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:09.400\nlike keep that crunch going where you like the UPS guy and you're like hello and you're\n\n01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:17.000\nlike like wink wink I get it we're both God that damn that's enlightenment I do you ever\n\n01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.880\nmaintain that for more than 15 seconds because UPS guy is bringing some piece of shit and\n\n01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:26.040\nyou're like this isn't what I ordered no I do it in bursts I want a guy on the 10 today\n\n01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:31.240\ncut me off and he did it in such a dick way and you're like a blue Honda right but that's\n\n01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:34.920\nwhat I did I was what else would God drive yeah he's driving his blue Honda and his windows\n\n01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:39.560\nare down and he really almost hit me as he as he and it was unnecessary and he's got\n\n01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.880\nin front of me and I didn't honk because I'm like I'm trying to build a narrative what\n\n01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:48.520\nam I what one of my favorite quotes is hate is a lack of imagination so I want to hate\n\n01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:53.120\nthis guy I love that's a lack of that was it it's actually I think it's like a proverb\n\n01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:57.160\nfrom a people it's not like a person that's fucking amazing give it a google is a lack\n\n01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:02.840\nof imagination isn't that beautiful you haven't bothered to think yet about how to not be pissed\n\n01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:06.440\noff I would I've added to it I think hell is a lack of imagination that's fantastic\n\n01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:10.320\nthat's also that's my little addition to it so this guy so I'm trying really hard to\n\n01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:15.240\ngo that you're that's gone imaginative he's just playing his part free wills and illusion\n\n01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:20.240\nwe're all just operating in the system of synapses and we're just it's just there the\n\n01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:25.200\nwhole all of this is one thing thinking itself and there's that thing there's that part and\n\n01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:30.000\nnow I'm interacting with it and how I react is is my choice or the illusion of my choice\n\n01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:38.040\nit's up to you so I didn't react but then someone did exactly to him what he just did\n\n01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:43.680\nto me like cut him off in the exact same way to him or you to him so someone's cutting\n\n01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:50.240\noff blue car God and Pete God is watching blue car God and that person I'm actually\n\n01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.840\nwatching and they're not doing it super aggressively they seem to be doing it more out of need\n\n01:34:53.840 --> 01:35:00.960\nblue car God honks actually speeds up trying to make a collision it looks like and then\n\n01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:05.280\nget changes lanes with his windows down and is honking at the person trying to get their\n\n01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:10.720\nattention to yell at them like fuck you fuck you fuck you and and now I'm trying to box\n\n01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:18.880\nhim in because I don't like blue car God anymore that's all outrage we're like I just was a\n\n01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:23.680\ngood person you're a shitty person the grace that I showed him he didn't have for someone\n\n01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:31.360\nwho just did what he did right but I mean what are we gonna do some gods are assholes\n\n01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:38.480\nwell that's why like like the actual like Zen spot you have to not only it's not about like\n\n01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:44.400\nit's not about stacking sandbags those will be overcome by the flood you have to actually arrive\n\n01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:50.640\nat a version of this that is proofed against infinity I actually think it's simpler than that\n\n01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:57.760\nthe brain wants a click moment late like Lego pieces of rationale my ego wants a story that goes\n\n01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:04.320\nwell he's probably late to something and therefore it's justifiable in this like 2018 American\n\n01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:09.840\ndriving etiquette but you have to empathize then no no no you don't have to do any of that in fact\n\n01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:15.520\nthe answer is way beyond your reason and it's beyond your it's trans accept you're like it's\n\n01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:19.840\nnot my job it's not even to think even that's a thought it's trans rational which is one of\n\n01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:26.320\nmy favorite words in the world it doesn't gross it's not rational at all it doesn't require any\n\n01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:29.520\neffort one of the reasons why people aren't more loving is because it takes all this effort\n\n01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:35.520\nyou have to like be loving but you can actually opt out of the whole game and just go like it\n\n01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:42.080\ndoesn't matter yeah my favorite you talked about Zen my favorite Zen thing is what in this moment\n\n01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:47.200\nis lacking yeah so I'm telling myself this story about what's fair and what's unfair and who's an\n\n01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:51.840\nasshole and how he should have learned by how I was nice to him he should be nice to somebody else\n\n01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:56.800\nwhen really all of that's over it's just become a story that my brain is telling me that's causing\n\n01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:03.440\nme suffering what if I can just do nothing not think but surrender and just go and yet here\n\n01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:09.280\nwe are nothing's wrong in this moment nothing's wrong your brain is just telling you stories\n\n01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:14.480\nthat create your suffering what do you think it is about us that makes us then because that seems\n\n01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:22.720\nso perfectly logical and it would make us all live longer right why are we we're addicted to it\n\n01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:29.120\nwhy are it's pleasant because the individual primate well I think it's more dopamine from alarm\n\n01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.400\nin the immediate sense right all right I don't I that's an interesting idea is that you get\n\n01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:40.080\nrewarded as a monkey for going well it's the huh there's something wrong it's the highs and lows\n\n01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:46.640\nthe the this is rom does he talks about the dark night of the soul is really when you realize\n\n01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.600\nthat you're going to lose the highs and the lows of being a part of the human drama yeah\n\n01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:58.480\nyeah my there my therapist told me she said she said so you may I'm like look I I had a major\n\n01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:03.840\ncorporation accused me of pedophilia they investigated me I I'm like I'm done like I've\n\n01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:08.160\ngone through all of these things I quit my twitter account but I've got for the last year I've gone\n\n01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:13.920\nthrough all these things and I arrived the story with her and she goes so you're happy now and I go\n\n01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:22.560\nyeah and she's like what what sorry what's that sound and she's like you're gonna walk around for\n\n01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:29.120\nthe next five years and she characterized it as this thing that I keep thinking of she goes\n\n01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:36.880\nwhen you get up from a bar and you're you're like where's my phone where are my keys that that's\n\n01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:43.120\nyour relationship with comfort and happiness that the human the human animal as a primate who\n\n01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:49.440\nsurvived this long all of our all of our DNA the reason we're here no matter how chill we are\n\n01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:57.360\nwe owe our fucking lives to the amoeba that was panicky that was like we should change\n\n01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:04.160\nyou're fucking a right good enough yet brother no you're absolutely and the and dead men tell no\n\n01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:13.920\ntales so every fucking chill squirrel yeah gone gone done and every fucking like thing that led to us\n\n01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:21.360\nit was like like especially us like and youth is like yeah climb a branch cling tight scream at\n\n01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:27.520\nthe top of your lungs right there is a leopard coming right and if you scream it loud enough at\n\n01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:34.880\nthe right time you will get laid yeah like and if you and if you're wrong if you can convince\n\n01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:41.760\nsomeone a leopard was coming you'll still get laid like that that we invented like no you're\n\n01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:48.320\nanxiety and alarm because because of a beautiful thing about our species a beautiful thing which\n\n01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:55.520\nis we don't want no fucking trouble yeah we don't like that is but the one that could imagine trouble\n\n01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:00.480\nand then prepare for it the problem is is my therapist always says you know it's a bell curve\n\n01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:06.960\nyou want to have just enough he's like paranoid people are right that that's what he says he's\n\n01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:10.880\nlike you're absolutely right to be paranoid you and this this is his language I hope you're not\n\n01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:15.200\noffended by it he goes you just don't want to be its bitch that's what he says that's the difference\n\n01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:19.440\nhe's like all of those things that you're worried about could happen that one of the things about\n\n01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:26.800\nbeing human is is learning how to like reconcile with that reality and live concurrently you know\n\n01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:32.320\nthe tough thing is though it was like like like so we we wake up every morning we turn on our phones\n\n01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:38.480\nwe have this app and the app says here's everything that happened to every fucking human being across\n\n01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:45.600\nthe planet yes includes everybody so so this is how many 19 year old black men got shot by police\n\n01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:50.080\nand they didn't deserve it and all these things happen so you get this fire hose to the face\n\n01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:59.040\nyep and and so the toughest thing of all is you go what you go wait so I'm supposed to do what\n\n01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:06.480\nand I'm supposed like like and and you get bifurcated at every instance like your your your ego\n\n01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:14.720\nwhich should come out of bed fully baked like rising like a beautiful souffle I don't know\n\n01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:19.680\nanything about cooking this metaphor is bad the souffles aren't for breakfast and that's not\n\n01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.480\nhow it works you're just saying you should be you should have this kind of like whole thing and\n\n01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:29.840\nthen and it's like you wake up in the morning and you pull out your phone and your phone is so\n\n01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:34.800\nand I'm not saying it's a bad thing because we don't want to your phone is now giving you this\n\n01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:42.240\ninformation that that you didn't get when you were a fucking regular ass primate yeah which is like\n\n01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:50.960\nlike somewhere right now someone is they just found their children's bones under a doghouse and the\n\n01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:58.080\nand the justice department says they should go fuck themselves you you have no like Prince\n\n01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:06.080\nGuatemala like like like had to leave his palace like like and go who's what's with that guy over\n\n01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:12.240\nthere and then the people are like he's got the flu and he's like well then I'm gonna be a religion\n\n01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:17.280\nlike like well get great like I guess hip hop was easier back then too like but\n\n01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:27.920\nlike every 13 year old now that can read the first thing they read is is is actual misery is\n\n01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.800\nhappening I don't know what I don't you know so Pete home so what are you gonna do in season four\n\n01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:38.320\nof crashing but it's it's you know your feed might be misery but the truth is is we could also just\n\n01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:42.960\nbe reading entertainment news we could just be doing Sudoku we could just be reading fiction it\n\n01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:49.200\ndoesn't have to be I'm just saying no no I think what's going on is no we're drawn to it I don't\n\n01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:54.000\nand I don't mean to imply it's being forced upon us I yeah no I didn't think you were but misery is\n\n01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.440\none of the avenues that you can choose and and maybe you know I it's good to know what's going\n\n01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.720\non the world for sure I think what's been perverted is our our we're addicted to thinking we love\n\n01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.520\nthinking and we think thinking about things is important and you're absolutely I think the brain\n\n01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:15.840\nis taken over our being the human brain is a terminal like you the servants become the master\n\n01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.400\nyou get to choose like like basically we're all and it's an addiction and it feels good knowing\n\n01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:24.960\neverything and no no no we're all choosing an individual level something that actually we\n\n01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:30.640\nshould be proud of right we should forgive ourselves for which is that if if you if you pump all\n\n01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:38.160\ninformation about human misery and pleasure into our brain we will over the shoes to focus on the\n\n01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:44.560\nmisery yeah and we will choose to figure out how to react to it the best way we can as children\n\n01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:50.320\nwhich is we will swing our toy fire truck at it we'll be like then fuck you that's right I hate\n\n01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:55.920\nbadness and I want goodness I don't want lucky charms I want golden grams right like we we don't\n\n01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:01.680\nknow what else to do we're children as a species what a what a species should be expected to deal\n\n01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:08.240\nwith all that information I agree I actually I would argue that it is certainly partly a bad thing\n\n01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.880\nyou know it's hard to talk about because I can't represent everybody in the room and I know a lot\n\n01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:20.960\nof people would say that you need to know what's going on I tend to opt out of as much of it as I\n\n01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:28.160\ncan all I know is that opting out has led toward my happiness but I'm not so naive as to think\n\n01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:34.800\nthat that means that everybody should opt out that's all I know right now is a 45 year old man that I\n\n01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:42.320\nI was making myself and other people miserable yeah and that I deleted my Twitter and my Facebook\n\n01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:48.560\nand that I got happier but I I absolutely keep in mind the fact that this is not that that's not\n\n01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:53.600\nthe third act of a story about being being happy right it might be the first act of a story about\n\n01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:58.400\ntaking responsibility I don't know I but the point I'm trying to make because we all have\n\n01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:03.360\nsocial responsibility and we do want to know about young black men being shot which was everybody\n\n01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:08.000\ncome on we all want to know about it well we need to know to keep people accountable it's the new\n\n01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:19.840\nmarmaduke hi Pete Holmes do not endorse that joke but what I'm trying to say is take the misery\n\n01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:25.600\naddiction out which it can be you're gonna replace most people are gonna replace it with something else\n\n01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.960\nand what I'm arguing for which brings me a lot of contentment not necessarily happiness but a lot\n\n01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:37.040\nof contentment a lot of equanimity is practicing being and we're getting robbed of that whether it\n\n01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:42.880\nis from just doing crosswords or reading entertainment news and not any of the serious stuff or any\n\n01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:48.640\nfucking bullshit or watching mindless endless television this is just feeding your ego feeding\n\n01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:52.800\nyou with anxiety and stress because I think we have an ego addiction as well we want to know who\n\n01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.280\nwe are so we can know oh I disagree with you this is why racism is so popular this is why\n\n01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:01.760\ntransphobia is so popular it's my misogyny so popular because we're feeding you're gonna you're\n\n01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:07.920\ngonna a faster path to find out who you are but not but not if there's articles that say like hey\n\n01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:12.560\nthis transgender bathroom fucking thing happened you're gonna click that faster than it's like\n\n01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.760\nhere's everything you've ever not wanted to know about blue whales like there's like all this\n\n01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:22.320\ninformation that's what I'm saying you're gonna rush your ego gets a rush going you're like I want\n\n01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:27.360\nto know who I am I want to know who I am it's it's it's tribalism it's it's a lot it gives a good\n\n01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:33.200\nfeeling of identity even the rage you go well that's fucking bullshit your ego goes here I am\n\n01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:38.240\nbut when I said earlier it seems like we're so far away from it what in this moment is lacking\n\n01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:46.000\nand I felt like we shared a nice moment of like here we are that's what's missing from equanimity\n\n01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:51.040\npeace and contentment and joy and bliss and it has very little to do with my fucking phone which I\n\n01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:58.400\ndon't turn on until after breakfast like well done like I'm like like I'm having these crazy dreams\n\n01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:03.760\nlately because I'm spending way more time on my screen than I ever have and it's fucking me up\n\n01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.960\nlike during the night and having like terrible like weird dreams but like going on stage and doing\n\n01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:13.280\ncomedy yeah you know what I call looking at Instagram before I go to bed casting my dream\n\n01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:20.320\nexactly it's fucking bullshit do you realize how every primitive culture what a value they put\n\n01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:24.720\non your dreams and what a glimpse into your subconscious and meaning they were and now I'm\n\n01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:33.280\ndreaming about fucking an episode of 24 we can you imagine our humanity you had like like yeah\n\n01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:38.400\nthey'd be like I was thinking about that today you gave one like primitive person a phone of\n\n01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:43.440\ncourse they'd look at it it's not your friend I'm sorry I took over no that's you that's where it's\n\n01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:47.120\nnot your friend it's where I was going while you're here but like like people like ask me like\n\n01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:50.400\ndo you get nervous when you walk on stage I'm like that's the least nervous I ever am because\n\n01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:55.360\nthat's the most present I am that's right I'm walking look at us none of us are looking at her\n\n01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:01.040\nphones it's fucking great yeah like it's like like being in a room full of people and like getting\n\n01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:07.440\nthe the call and response of talking and laughter or the silence of thoughts and stuff like that like\n\n01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.960\nthat's that's the most pure thing of my day and then you walk off stage and you're like oh\n\n01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.360\nthat's right what are they saying about it and who fucking cares who gives a stupid dude we've\n\n01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:22.160\nfigured out we've all sort of woke up about food at least a lot of us have that a lot of food is\n\n01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:26.000\nmade by corporations that don't care about you that just want to make you addicted to food that\n\n01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.040\nseemed to like be something right around supersize me we're like oh they just want to make you want\n\n01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:35.520\nmore of it so you just buy more of it it's just capitalism right we're starting to figure out\n\n01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:40.960\nthe same thing about your phone that the colors on your phone trigger things in your brain that\n\n01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:46.080\nmake you like seriously addicted to it because those were colors that were important to your\n\n01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:53.280\nsurvival red doesn't belong in that way in fucking snapchat it's making something happen in your brain\n\n01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:58.960\nthat was designed to keep you alive and it's the manipulation of that in the same way that msg is\n\n01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.440\naddictive or sugar is addicted these colors and but there's a part of it like everything that\n\n01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:08.800\ntastes good though there's a part of it that works really well I mean the advent of smartphones\n\n01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:14.800\nand everyone being connected the dropping of shame veils the idea that you could be in Iowa and\n\n01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:20.640\ntalk to somebody someone in Wyoming means that like trans people gay people yeah that's right but\n\n01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:28.640\nthat that that you you nerds like like who can propel marvel empires to empire status like\n\n01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:35.360\neveryone it can suddenly just go like hey fuck fuck with the 150 jackoffs at my accounting\n\n01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:42.640\ncompany think I I live in the real world which is on my phone which is the more real than I\n\n01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:48.160\nunderstand hall which says that actually I think Robert Downey Jr. is a great choice for Tony Stark\n\n01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:53.360\nand I fucking sign off on that and I upvote it and you feel vindicated it's Billy Elliot in your\n\n01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.800\npocket and then it has this horrible like downside which is like also across town in a basement all\n\n01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:07.200\nthe Nazis going like hey oh shit I'm not the only 38 year old virgin uh fuck Jews swipe right like\n\n01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:14.080\nhating Jews oh I love I love hating Jews too and everyone the shame barrier drops and you got a\n\n01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:21.840\nbunch of human brains going like I'm not ashamed I love my voice I'm talking now right but but I\n\n01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.720\nI feel I would argue you can do all of that with your phone on grayscale though oh yes yes\n\n01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:32.400\nyes no I know that which is an option it's very easy to do it's under accessibility and you can\n\n01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:36.880\nmake it a triple click shortcut if you want to use your map or something that you think requires\n\n01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:42.080\ncolor my phone's on I have a lot of p-tips to get off your phone I've and color is a huge one it\n\n01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:48.320\ndoes drain your battery a little bit go to p-tips do you go to p-tips.net full color page explaining\n\n01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:54.400\nI'm nothing but a supporter of p-tips but I also look at myself at 45 I feel like the reason I'm\n\n01:50:54.400 --> 01:51:03.040\ninto p-tips uh is not because I'm a I'm enlightened it's because I actually like I feel beaten and\n\n01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:10.160\nlike I'm like I feel like the onion knight in game of thrones like I'm like I he cut my fingers off\n\n01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:17.040\nI'm cool like like like that and so I want I feel pity for the average 19 year old out there it's\n\n01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:23.520\nlike now these old enlightened people telling me turn on grayscale yeah do that later do I did that\n\n01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:29.600\nwhen I was 38 okay you know what I mean great but I got it but you got to be somebody before you\n\n01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:36.240\ncan be nobody but the yeah that's that's by being somebody we mean being part of the board cube\n\n01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:45.040\nthat's the yeah exactly yeah like I'm not gonna raise my daughter to be fuck that be like me from\n\n01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:48.640\nthe beginning when are you gonna when are you gonna

01:52:00.160\nto come back to the village isn't a flaw that's what makes that's what gives life a pulse you\n\n01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:04.400\nhave to have that you have to have your fuck up period I'm grateful for it yeah I don't know if\n\n01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:10.560\nI'm gonna I don't that's the biggest thing about me when I think about having kids I'm like I don't\n\n01:52:10.560 -->
