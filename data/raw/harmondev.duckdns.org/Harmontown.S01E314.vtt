00:29.540 --> 00:31.540
Oh, we got a biggie for you.

00:31.540 --> 00:33.380
Well, let's start out with the biggest of all,

00:33.380 --> 00:34.900
meaning the smallest of all,

00:34.900 --> 00:36.660
because he's lost so much goddamn weight,

00:36.660 --> 00:38.940
Spencer Crittenden, your game master, everybody.

00:38.940 --> 00:39.780
Oh!

00:39.780 --> 00:40.620
Oh!

00:48.620 --> 00:49.780
But the reason for the season,

00:49.780 --> 00:52.540
let's bring out your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:52.540 --> 00:53.380
Oh!

00:53.380 --> 00:54.220
Oh!

00:54.220 --> 00:55.060
Oh!

00:55.060 --> 00:55.900
Oh!

00:55.900 --> 00:56.740
Oh!

00:56.740 --> 00:57.580
Oh!

00:57.580 --> 00:58.420
Oh!

00:58.420 --> 00:59.260
Oh!

01:00.700 --> 01:01.540
Dan!

01:01.540 --> 01:02.380
Oh!

01:02.380 --> 01:03.220
Oh!

01:03.220 --> 01:05.380
Hip, hip to the hop, yo!

01:05.380 --> 01:07.660
Hip, hip to the rap, yo!

01:07.660 --> 01:09.940
Hip, hip to the hip, hop, rap, yo!

01:09.940 --> 01:12.340
Hip, my style, goin' to the rap, yo!

01:12.340 --> 01:14.500
Oh, I got my big style, me!

01:14.500 --> 01:18.500
I'm Mr. Blue jeans, I'm rappin'!

01:18.500 --> 01:19.340
Okay.

01:21.220 --> 01:22.700
Thanks for comin'!

01:22.700 --> 01:23.700
Oh, yeah.

01:26.340 --> 01:28.140
Thanks, guys, thanks.

01:28.140 --> 01:30.100
Never gonna look at you, never gonna look at you.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.260
We get an exciting guest tonight,

01:33.260 --> 01:34.300
I can't wait to see him again.

01:34.300 --> 01:35.980
I mean, I saw him, I just saw him.

01:35.980 --> 01:36.820
Woo!

01:38.180 --> 01:40.060
I don't wanna maintain that show biz thing,

01:40.060 --> 01:42.540
where you're like, wow, did they just appear on stage?

01:42.540 --> 01:46.900
No, I know who's here, and I just talked to him,

01:46.900 --> 01:49.460
but I haven't seen him since I was on his podcast,

01:49.460 --> 01:50.940
and it was a delightful chat.

01:50.940 --> 01:54.380
I, we'll talk more about that later.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.620
What do I have to talk about?

01:56.620 --> 02:01.620
I, okay, so, all right, I'm not gonna play

02:03.140 --> 02:04.520
No Man's Sky anymore.

02:06.020 --> 02:06.860
Yay.

02:08.220 --> 02:09.940
I'm back at the modded Minecraft,

02:09.940 --> 02:14.940
and I accidentally one-click ordered a new gaming laptop,

02:21.660 --> 02:26.540
and it runs great.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.020
I love it.

02:28.020 --> 02:29.900
I'm saying all these things with a lot of shame,

02:29.900 --> 02:33.380
because I'm like, I don't know how to be happy.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.820
I was in my car this morning,

02:35.820 --> 02:39.060
and I was like, I was going through the audio books,

02:39.060 --> 02:44.060
and I was like, I wanna listen to a book

02:44.060 --> 02:46.820
about what I'm going through.

02:46.820 --> 02:49.100
I was like, what am I going through?

02:49.100 --> 02:51.540
What would your therapist say?

02:51.540 --> 02:52.900
Coping with happiness.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.980
Well, so it wasn't a big surprise

02:55.980 --> 02:58.980
that that's not like a big book-selling market.

02:58.980 --> 03:01.460
There's nothing, there's nothing.

03:01.460 --> 03:02.900
So you're coping with happiness,

03:02.900 --> 03:04.660
there's nothing, and you type happiness,

03:04.660 --> 03:07.500
and then you get a couple hits that are like,

03:07.500 --> 03:09.220
the advantage of happiness.

03:09.220 --> 03:12.460
Why happiness is better than what you're going through?

03:13.740 --> 03:15.660
How to get happiness and all this stuff,

03:15.660 --> 03:18.800
and I'm like, well, none of these things are really for me.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.400
I did, I did, I did, I got one that was like,

03:23.400 --> 03:25.680
the happiness advantage,

03:25.680 --> 03:27.800
because it's like, if a guy's talking about,

03:27.800 --> 03:29.400
oh, it's good to be happy,

03:29.400 --> 03:33.160
then that's pretty close to saying, oh, you're happy,

03:33.160 --> 03:34.720
here's how you deal with it.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.360
But it's not, because I stopped,

03:39.360 --> 03:42.280
I paid 20 bucks for it, and then the guy was like,

03:42.280 --> 03:47.280
I'm gonna tell you how happiness is better than you think.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.520
Everyone thinks that if you succeed,

03:50.520 --> 03:51.760
then you'll be happy.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.120
First of all, that's not at all,

03:53.120 --> 03:55.400
I don't buy into that.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.440
It happens to be true in my case,

03:59.440 --> 04:03.200
but I didn't, it was my path to happiness,

04:03.200 --> 04:05.440
but I realized that that path is not,

04:05.440 --> 04:09.720
so I'm like, okay, I succeeded, so I'm happy,

04:09.720 --> 04:13.000
and then all the happiness books are like,

04:13.000 --> 04:14.640
what's with this success thing?

04:14.640 --> 04:16.220
And I'm like, well, everything.

04:16.220 --> 04:19.360
So I can't hear the, but then I think about,

04:19.360 --> 04:20.760
so then the guy's like,

04:20.760 --> 04:22.880
I'm gonna tell you how it's good to be happy.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.520
Chapter one, I applied for Harvard on a dare,

04:26.520 --> 04:27.800
and I'm like, what the, what?

04:27.800 --> 04:31.120
That's literally how the book starts,

04:31.120 --> 04:33.320
that's the only thing I have to talk about.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.200
I applied to Harvard on a dare,

04:36.200 --> 04:37.440
how do you, don't you know people

04:37.440 --> 04:39.240
are gonna be listening to your book?

04:40.840 --> 04:42.600
They paid $20 for it.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.480
No one that went to Harvard under any circumstances

04:47.360 --> 04:50.160
paid $20 for a book on happiness.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.440
Like most of the people had $40,

04:52.440 --> 04:53.920
and were like, I'll take half of this,

04:53.920 --> 04:56.080
and I'm gonna fucking let it roll.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.200
Like, let's try it.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.360
Something's gotta give,

04:59.360 --> 05:02.360
like maybe the reason why this $40 isn't $80

05:02.360 --> 05:03.880
is because I haven't spent $20.

05:03.880 --> 05:07.360
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.520
Steve brought that out.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.080
All right.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.080
I got one, I got one, you guys.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.360
I've been railing about,

05:14.360 --> 05:17.280
you know about this war on Christmas.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.200
Like, we talk about it a lot on here.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.600
I think last week or something,

05:20.600 --> 05:24.560
I was talking about what the Reese's Cups has been doing.

05:24.560 --> 05:25.480
Oh, right, right, right.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.560
But what about these, the newest salvo

05:28.560 --> 05:33.560
in the war on Christmas is these new holiday-colored soda cans.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.960
They got green ribbons on them.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.040
The coax, they don't taste right

05:38.040 --> 05:40.800
because they have a war on Christmas.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.640
Oh.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.640
They make them taste worse than normal Coke

05:43.640 --> 05:46.280
to make people hate Christmas.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.520
And then they put a green ribbon on it.

05:49.920 --> 05:50.760
That's all.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.320
Okay, who's Troll Air Dropping, man?

05:55.320 --> 05:56.640
Oh, no.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.520
Oh, boy.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.520
This is a new thing.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.240
What's your, what's your name, sir?

06:03.400 --> 06:06.280
I'm like Atticus Finch, who are you?

06:06.280 --> 06:08.680
Jebediah, you're better than this.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.080
I actually, I kind of like that.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.400
It's like the whole world is now a 70s single bar.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.920
Like, we're like a Laverne shirt.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.720
You guys don't know anything I'm talking about.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.360
But there would be like phones on the tables.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.360
Like the single scene would be like, hey, good looking.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.920
I was on a plane and somebody started air dropping me.

06:29.920 --> 06:32.200
Cause yeah, you, okay, so you saw my phone

06:32.200 --> 06:33.400
and what's it called?

06:33.400 --> 06:37.520
Well, the name is not a famous person's iPhone.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.360
Nice.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.600
Wait, wait, wait, Dan, Dan, Dan, let me hit pause here.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.920
You can be on a plane and someone can find your phone.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.960
If my Bluetooth is on, you can change your settings

06:47.960 --> 06:48.800
to not available.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.120
And the air drop, like they interrupt what you're hearing

06:51.120 --> 06:52.960
or they just see it come up and go,

06:52.960 --> 06:54.720
oh, so-and-so wants you to hear.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.400
Maybe not what you're hearing, no.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.000
It sends you a notification that there's a picture

06:59.000 --> 07:00.680
or something like a photo.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.200
Oh, I see, I got you.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.000
I thought they were like gonna play you some music

07:05.000 --> 07:05.840
or some shit.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.680
No.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.040
I mean, this would be, you can see how if you did this

07:09.040 --> 07:11.920
while I was in my house, that would be a federal,

07:13.120 --> 07:15.520
because it's just a photo of me.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.400
When you're at a show, it's fun,

07:18.400 --> 07:20.760
but this is exactly what rapists do.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.320
10 times before they,

07:28.960 --> 07:30.760
before they take it to the next level.

07:30.760 --> 07:33.520
It's because it's a photo of me.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.920
Am I driver's license is probably in it?

07:34.920 --> 07:38.280
No, but yeah, I do, I like it.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.760
But I remember I was on a plane

07:40.760 --> 07:43.400
and somebody started sending me shit

07:43.400 --> 07:44.720
and it was like random shit.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.800
And then I started, I was sending him random shit.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.840
I project this gender onto a person

07:49.840 --> 07:53.560
who would fucking push their way into your phone.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.160
I feel like if I had a guess

07:57.160 --> 07:59.720
that it's like a dude on the plane,

07:59.720 --> 08:03.320
and I started, I don't know if that's a thing

08:03.320 --> 08:07.480
where people have photo wars in random places.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.760
Do people do that just to random strangers?

08:09.760 --> 08:11.680
Do you guys just send?

08:11.680 --> 08:12.960
Always, yeah.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.760
In the Starbucks.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.880
What are you, I wanna ask you so many questions,

08:16.880 --> 08:20.880
but then you're not mic'd and there's 50 of you, so.

08:20.880 --> 08:21.760
It wouldn't make any sense.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.560
Thank you for that photo of me.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.400
Abed.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.000
Oh, I declined it, I declined it on accident.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.720
It's a habit, because I didn't wanna commit.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.520
I should've saved it, it's a good photo.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.560
I look very handsome.

08:35.560 --> 08:38.280
Abed texted me a couple months ago

08:38.280 --> 08:40.560
and he's like, these kids, I'm at this subway

08:40.560 --> 08:43.480
and these kids keep airdropping me, these naked pictures.

08:43.480 --> 08:47.200
I think they're trying to get me in trouble with the police.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.600
And I was like, that sucks, man.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.800
I don't know if they're trying to call the police.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.520
The person on the airplane that they kept airdropping,

08:53.520 --> 08:54.680
they were like memes.

08:54.680 --> 08:57.800
They were like pictures of African-American people

08:57.800 --> 08:59.920
looking horrible.

08:59.920 --> 09:00.920
Yeah, racist memes.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.640
They were like memes about Daylight Savings Time

09:04.640 --> 09:05.640
that I couldn't even tell.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.840
I was like, I'm not on Twitter anymore,

09:07.840 --> 09:10.400
so I don't know if it was Daylight Savings Time,

09:10.400 --> 09:13.200
like a slam on liberals.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.880
Did we vote against Daylight Savings Time?

09:15.880 --> 09:17.040
That sounds right.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.240
I know, it was like random shit.

09:20.240 --> 09:24.320
I was like, I think this person is racist and a virgin.

09:24.320 --> 09:27.000
Like, that's all I could tell from the thing.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.840
And I just kept sending them just pictures

09:29.840 --> 09:33.160
of Henry Winkler and stuff.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.800
So people can just send you photos to your phone.

09:35.800 --> 09:40.800
Yeah, I want to be clear, just in case everybody's like,

09:40.800 --> 09:41.720
what are you talking about?

09:41.720 --> 09:44.160
You can easily, you can make your settings

09:44.160 --> 09:47.120
so that you're not available to any of that mischievous.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.960
I think I have that setting on right now.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.280
Yeah, and you should.

09:50.280 --> 09:54.120
And I know, I'm not like, god damn you,

09:54.120 --> 09:58.240
technology, I could easily, there's a get off my lawn

09:58.240 --> 10:01.920
button, so I'm not mad.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.960
I just changed the name of my phone

10:03.960 --> 10:08.240
to not a famous person's iPhone.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.040
That's how you found it.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.360
All right, I have nothing to offer.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.560
Thank you for coming.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.240
You have lots to offer.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.880
You should be pumped.

10:16.880 --> 10:17.880
It's Monday night.

10:17.880 --> 10:25.840
I think it's the new Tuesday.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.280
Oh, yeah.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.600
Let's just bring out our old friend and chat with him,

10:29.600 --> 10:31.400
because there's nothing I could offer you

10:31.400 --> 10:34.960
that he can't amplify and double.

10:34.960 --> 10:39.280
He's performed at clubs and colleges all across Utah.

10:43.240 --> 10:47.240
He may or may not have recently been me tooed.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.120
Let's find out.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.680
I can't cheap up.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.320
He got me freed.

10:53.320 --> 10:58.240
He's the first white male to be me freed.

10:58.240 --> 11:03.360
I think the third season of HBO's Crashing is coming out.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.160
Dirty Clean premiere is on Saturday.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.440
Oh, you get the real information.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.320
Dirty Clean premiere is Saturday, December 15th on HBO

11:10.320 --> 11:13.720
and season three of Crashing returns on Sunday, January 20.

11:13.720 --> 11:14.800
Let's bring him out.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.600
You know him.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.280
You like him.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.040
Pete Ho.

11:27.640 --> 11:28.140
Yep.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.800
The first guy to get me freed.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.560
You're the first guy to get me freed.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.880
I'm the first guy to get me freed.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.680
How do I break it?

11:43.680 --> 11:45.120
Harmontown.

11:45.120 --> 11:50.120
Don't start a sing-song with me, you salty dog.

11:50.120 --> 11:55.120
I'm a UCB-trained improviser, and I will join you in any bit,

11:55.120 --> 11:57.120
no matter how salacious.

11:57.120 --> 12:00.120
No matter how ill-timed and boring,

12:00.120 --> 12:03.120
because, believe me, if you've really listened to the show,

12:03.120 --> 12:07.120
you know, like, we could do 90 minutes of bad musical.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.120
Could we?

12:08.120 --> 12:09.120
Oh, yeah.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.120
Calm and down.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.120
I wouldn't start it that way.

12:14.120 --> 12:17.120
Wait, Dan, that's the first rule of improv.

12:17.120 --> 12:20.120
Whoa, whoa, he's not in the audience.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.120
You are not UCB-trained, sir.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.120
I wouldn't get sicked out.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.120
All right, oh, no, let's start.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.120
Oh, yeah.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.120
Chigadingdingdingding.

12:36.120 --> 12:39.120
Oh, good day, sir.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.120
Hello.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.120
Why, I haven't seen you in a fortnight.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.120
Yes, you have.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.120
I have?

12:47.120 --> 12:52.120
Oh, let me get my spectacles.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.120
Clarence.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.120
Hey, Toby.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.120
I didn't recognize you without my spectacles,

12:59.120 --> 13:03.120
which you saw that I polished.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.120
I'm sick of those spectacles.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.120
Oh, my God.

13:07.120 --> 13:11.120
I would like a pack of gum.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.120
All right, we can go with either offer.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.120
I know I put out two things.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.120
Sorry, that wasn't...

13:19.120 --> 13:21.120
That's not...

13:21.120 --> 13:24.120
Sorry, sorry.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.120
I liked both offerings.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.120
I've never heard offerings.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.120
What do you mean?

13:28.120 --> 13:30.120
Oh, yay.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.120
We have bubble table.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.120
Oh, God.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.120
Toby?

13:36.120 --> 13:39.120
Toby, would you please come into my office?

13:39.120 --> 13:40.120
Yes.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.120
How many times have I told you not to argue with our customers?

13:43.120 --> 13:47.120
Well, I'm sorry, but people keep getting angry for no reason

13:47.120 --> 13:50.120
and then breaking character.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.120
Well, stop it.

13:52.120 --> 13:58.120
I'm just showing you how you do a windmill.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.120
This is my area.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.120
It's where I keep the gum.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.120
I would like two packs.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.120
I know you're usual.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.120
Tidal wave.

14:08.120 --> 14:11.120
Toby, thank you.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.120
And bubble tape.

14:13.120 --> 14:17.120
The funniest gums.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.120
One, if you're laughing, you're 30.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.120
The other, we can all enjoy.

14:22.120 --> 14:26.120
Oh, wow, human feces.

14:26.120 --> 14:30.120
I made them both.

14:30.120 --> 14:35.120
Each of them has a story.

14:35.120 --> 14:40.120
However, each of them will frighten.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.120
I'm sorry.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.120
Each little piece of poop you gave me has a story.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.120
Yes.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.120
And one of them scary.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.120
Both are scary.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.120
Tidal wave story.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.120
No, that's the...

14:54.120 --> 14:55.120
Okay.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.120
Okay.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.120
Well, I...

14:57.120 --> 14:58.120
I think we're done.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.120
Okay.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.120
We'll do more later.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.120
That was a great...

15:02.120 --> 15:05.120
That's where the training really...

15:05.120 --> 15:07.120
You're like, yeah, you know what?

15:07.120 --> 15:09.120
What they would like is to stop doing this,

15:09.120 --> 15:12.120
and that's the actual instinct.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.120
Well, yeah, self-editing.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.120
Yeah.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.120
I thought maybe you would run across.

15:17.120 --> 15:21.120
I tried to, but then I had the mic cord issues.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.120
Yeah, no, the mic cord was difficult.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.120
That's why improvisers don't tend to use them.

15:25.120 --> 15:28.120
Yeah, but if we did it without microphones right now,

15:28.120 --> 15:31.120
I think our podcast would suffer, or would it?

15:31.120 --> 15:33.120
If we did the show without mics?

15:33.120 --> 15:35.120
I like when things on podcasts happen,

15:35.120 --> 15:37.120
or it's like, why are you out?

15:37.120 --> 15:39.120
There's a moment.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.120
Well, just for a moment, yeah.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.120
There's a moment.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.120
Like when a stand-up is like,

15:44.120 --> 15:46.120
and then my drunk aunt comes over,

15:46.120 --> 15:48.120
and she's like, what the god damn it?

15:48.120 --> 15:49.120
Yeah.

15:49.120 --> 15:53.120
And you associate distant sound with loudness.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.120
Yeah, distant sound with loudness.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.120
Because otherwise the alternative is...

15:57.120 --> 15:58.120
How about this, how about this?

15:58.120 --> 16:00.120
Give me two mics.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.120
I want an area mic, you guys.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.120
Put your mic down.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.120
I would just do one.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.120
I have an area mic, so you're doing it.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.120
I would just do...

16:10.120 --> 16:11.120
Oh.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.120
No, no, no.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.120
You guys are going to do a scene.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.120
I'm going to do like cedar area mic-ing,

16:15.120 --> 16:17.120
and you're going to have to project...

16:17.120 --> 16:19.120
You said area mic, sorry.

16:19.120 --> 16:22.120
Because he doesn't know what that means, Pete.

16:22.120 --> 16:25.120
Pete, you are a UCB trained improviser.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.120
This guy doesn't know shit.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.120
Yeah, come on.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.120
I see you is what I'm saying.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.120
Do we do...

16:32.120 --> 16:33.120
Area.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.120
Do we do a scene...

16:34.120 --> 16:35.120
Yeah.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.120
Just sitting, like a radio scene?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.120
No, you walk around.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.120
You want blocking?

16:38.120 --> 16:39.120
Okay.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.120
But how will the mics pick up that whole area?

16:42.120 --> 16:44.120
It's an area mic.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.120
Oh.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.120
Hamburger.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.120
Someone said no.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.120
No.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.120
No.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.120
No.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.120
No.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.120
No.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.120
Alright.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.120
No.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.120
Alright.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.120
You guys have to be loud,

16:59.120 --> 17:01.120
because I'm area mic-ing you right now.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.120
No.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.120
No.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.120
No.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.120
No.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.120
No.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.120
No.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.120
No.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.120
No.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.120
No.

17:10.120 --> 17:11.120
No.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.120
No.

17:12.120 --> 17:13.120
No.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.120
No.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.120
No.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.120
No.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.120
No.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.120
No.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.120
No.

17:19.120 --> 17:20.120
No.

17:20.120 --> 17:21.120
No.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.120
No.

17:22.120 --> 17:23.620
No.

17:23.620 --> 17:24.620
No.

17:28.120 --> 17:29.120
No care.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.120
No.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.120
No.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.120
No.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.120
No.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.120
No.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.120
No.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.120
No.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.120
No.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.120
No.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.120
No.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.120
No.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.120
No.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.120
No.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.120
No.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.120
No.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.120
No.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.120
No.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.120
No.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.120
No.

17:48.120 --> 17:52.740
And then I kept telling him, also for the people listening,

17:52.740 --> 17:53.840
I keep doing a whiff.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.040
Yeah, there's like a whiff.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.000
Yeah, there's like a whiff.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
That joke's not going to work with them.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.440
Well, you know what?

18:01.440 --> 18:03.520
It's ad supported.

18:03.520 --> 18:09.600
I am in a different scene than the one that we started in.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.400
Oh, OK.

18:10.400 --> 18:14.440
And I'm talking to you now as my therapist.

18:14.440 --> 18:15.200
That's right.

18:15.200 --> 18:19.280
And that's how I'm explaining to you what happened to me

18:19.280 --> 18:22.760
when I was in the scene where I went into a store earlier.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.400
Oh, you're the same character, but you're in a different place.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.480
Yes.

18:26.480 --> 18:31.920
Unless you, I'm like, look, I want you to take part in this too.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.760
Yeah, no, no, I'm just a therapist.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.160
I'm not also the guy that owns the gum store.

18:36.160 --> 18:40.600
No, I can say if it's up to me, which it shouldn't be.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.800
It's up to you.

18:41.800 --> 18:46.200
But my opinion is that you're not, that you're a different character.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.040
I'm a different guy.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.360
That's why I made a white bee gesture.

18:49.360 --> 18:52.000
Yeah, that's, and I have a beard of bees.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.400
Oh, shit.

18:54.400 --> 18:54.880
Wow.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.400
I hope you're not allergic.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.760
No, I mean, we had this conversation

19:04.760 --> 19:06.400
when I agreed to go with you.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.680
Be my patient, yeah.

19:07.680 --> 19:13.000
But did you know I also have pubes of bees?

19:13.000 --> 19:16.120
I always wondered.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.200
And that's how I got me three.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.640
I got me three showing my beard of bees pubes to you.

19:28.640 --> 19:32.640
Now we know it works without mics too, yeah.

19:32.640 --> 19:33.160
What do you think?

19:33.160 --> 19:34.640
What do you think it works?

19:34.640 --> 19:38.120
Like, in a totally grounded, like, your actual speculation

19:38.120 --> 19:41.360
of in a world where the hashtag me three existed,

19:41.360 --> 19:47.560
it would be actually like, what would the me three movement be?

19:47.560 --> 19:48.680
Yeah, me three.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.720
I don't like people when people call, you know,

19:50.720 --> 19:52.160
there's number one.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.360
Like, I go number one.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.040
Right.

19:54.040 --> 19:54.920
And that's a pee pee.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.320
Right.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.200
And then I'm explaining this in case there's someone

19:59.200 --> 20:00.080
from Lithuania.

20:00.080 --> 20:00.560
Yeah.

20:00.560 --> 20:05.440
I know it's a very different system in Lithuania.

20:05.440 --> 20:10.480
It's like, it must be nice to have numbers for a waste.

20:10.480 --> 20:13.000
We go in and whatever happens, happens.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.240
Sometimes number two is part P.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.520
But a number two is a poo poo.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.880
Everyone knows this.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.680
But then some people get cued with it and they say,

20:23.680 --> 20:26.360
I just did a number three, which means they did a poo poo

20:26.360 --> 20:27.440
and a pee pee.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.280
But who is doing a poo poo without a pee pee?

20:29.280 --> 20:29.680
Right.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.160
That was an emergency poo poo.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.840
Well, when we were kids, we would have that.

20:32.840 --> 20:33.800
What's a number three?

20:33.800 --> 20:36.360
It would be like, oh, is that puke, burps?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.400
Yeah.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.520
Milk coming out of a booby?

20:39.520 --> 20:40.160
Yeah.

20:40.160 --> 20:42.760
That's a number seven.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.320
Well, let me ask you this.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.920
Is it about my lactation?

20:45.920 --> 20:47.600
Because I told you not to bring that up.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.320
It involves it.

20:50.320 --> 20:56.400
If you push the button and then you pull the chain,

20:56.400 --> 20:59.760
out comes chocolate choo-choo train?

20:59.760 --> 21:01.880
Objection, leading the witness.

21:01.880 --> 21:02.600
Yeah, exactly.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.640
Jeff, please.

21:04.640 --> 21:05.800
We're talking about lactation.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.440
He's talking about milk, milk, lemonade.

21:08.440 --> 21:08.720
Right.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.800
So where is your fudge made?

21:10.800 --> 21:11.800
Round the back.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.800
Oh, OK.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.320
Doesn't that throw off the meter?

21:15.320 --> 21:16.960
Shouldn't it be around the corner?

21:16.960 --> 21:18.000
I say around the back.

21:18.000 --> 21:18.600
Really?

21:18.600 --> 21:19.000
Yeah.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Milk, milk, lemonade, round the back.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.480
Fudges made?

21:22.480 --> 21:22.960
Corner?

21:22.960 --> 21:24.040
What are you, a sex pistol?

21:24.040 --> 21:25.280
Corner?

21:25.280 --> 21:26.040
Round the corner.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.240
Angles on my hips?

21:28.240 --> 21:29.720
It's round the back.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.560
Milk, milk, lemonade, round the corner.

21:32.560 --> 21:33.480
Fudge is made.

21:33.480 --> 21:34.720
It's ionic pentameter.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.240
Milk, lemonade, round the back.

21:36.240 --> 21:36.840
Round the back.

21:36.840 --> 21:37.920
Fudge is made.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.000
It's like your cockney.

21:40.000 --> 21:40.920
Round the back.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.520
Fudge is made.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.120
I'm going to fucking slam you with the.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.080
It's like a cockney.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.760
It's not a civilized expression.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.240
It's a working class.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.360
It's a cockney that brings up the back.

21:50.360 --> 21:51.560
Biological education.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.280
That's where you get the fudge.

21:53.280 --> 21:54.360
It's the first draft.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.520
By the way, welcome to the show, and do you want to talk

21:56.520 --> 21:58.880
about who are you and what are you?

21:58.880 --> 21:59.440
Who are you?

21:59.440 --> 22:02.920
Well, I'm a cockney, Rhimes Smith.

22:02.920 --> 22:06.040
And, well, I'm Pete.

22:06.040 --> 22:06.960
I'm Pete Holmes.

22:06.960 --> 22:10.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:10.480 --> 22:14.080
He has a podcast that I was on.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.520
You were on a wonderful episode called You Made It Weird.

22:16.520 --> 22:23.160
I told you backstage that my therapist who is known to my

22:23.160 --> 22:24.840
audience.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.040
Fear to be his callback.

22:26.040 --> 22:29.600
Like, my therapist doesn't acknowledge, like, she's like,

22:29.600 --> 22:31.240
she uses family guy references.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.480
And then I'm like, you know, I have a cartoon

22:33.480 --> 22:35.080
that you could reference.

22:35.080 --> 22:38.880
And she's like, yeah, I tried to watch, you know.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.840
I've come to realize that she's maybe not negging me,

22:42.840 --> 22:46.640
but is like that she understands that if she ever

22:46.640 --> 22:50.920
did cross that threshold that it would lower my opinion of her

22:50.920 --> 22:53.160
as far as a person who's under my hood.

22:53.160 --> 22:53.800
I see.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.000
Which makes sense to me.

22:55.000 --> 22:55.440
I get it.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.200
Let's talk about that.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.320
Wait, because you're big into all spiritual,

22:59.320 --> 23:01.000
mental, physical well-being.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.160
Yeah, sure.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.800
Are you?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.400
That was the best heckle?

23:05.400 --> 23:09.920
No, our audience is mixing well.

23:09.920 --> 23:10.880
I'm into therapy.

23:10.880 --> 23:11.960
I have a therapist.

23:11.960 --> 23:17.720
Does your therapist watch your show, HBO's Crashing?

23:17.720 --> 23:19.920
Yeah, I hope so.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.800
And then, well, what do you mean you hope so?

23:21.800 --> 23:23.360
Because you're in therapy once a week.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.920
And do you go in and go, it's like that one episode?

23:25.920 --> 23:28.920
And do they go, yeah, I saw it.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.880
Well, I don't want any spoilers for him.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.760
I want to be free to talk about it.

23:32.760 --> 23:33.480
Well, previously.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.800
No, ruining it for him.

23:35.800 --> 23:36.960
That's not real.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.680
I'm asking a real question.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.240
Does your therapist acknowledge the content

23:41.240 --> 23:43.000
that you create in your therapy sessions?

23:43.000 --> 23:47.640
Because with therapists, for me, I'm looking for surrogate dads.

23:47.640 --> 23:51.440
So I want someone to say, I'm very proud of you, Peter.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.480
You did a good job on that episode.

23:53.480 --> 23:57.120
And if they, I just collect dads.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.240
Like, I have a dad.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.240
And he's great.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.520
But I could use some more.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.320
Like, no offense to my dad.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.560
No, OK, yeah.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.640
Let's get some more of that in here.

24:11.640 --> 24:16.880
Like, my mom was so into me a little too much.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.760
And then my dad was, you know, my dad

24:19.760 --> 24:24.680
calls Judd Apatow Jeff Applebaum, which is fine.

24:24.680 --> 24:28.520
I guess he doesn't need to know what it is that I do.

24:28.520 --> 24:33.600
But then I hire other men that are around his age.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.800
Who are like, so you talk to Judd Apatow,

24:35.800 --> 24:38.720
and you're like, OK, this is like, I got my dad, but he knows.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.120
Papa?

24:40.120 --> 24:41.240
Yeah.

24:41.240 --> 24:45.760
And then we hug, and it costs $42,000.

24:45.760 --> 24:46.760
It's not really that much.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.360
If you're thinking about going to therapy, go for it.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.960
Most of you have been to a therapist, right?

24:51.960 --> 24:53.880
Clap if you've been to a therapist.

24:53.880 --> 24:57.480
Because my therapist said, this was a while ago,

24:57.480 --> 25:00.440
my therapist at one point, I remember her saying to me,

25:00.440 --> 25:04.200
yeah, I wanted to let you know that I was going on a road

25:04.200 --> 25:07.840
trip, and I asked my friend to recommend some stuff

25:07.840 --> 25:10.160
to listen to while I was driving for five hours.

25:10.160 --> 25:13.200
And she gave me this list of things.

25:13.200 --> 25:19.440
And on it was you talking to some Pete Holmes guy.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.280
I was like, she didn't know either of us.

25:21.280 --> 25:27.320
She was just like, you know, that to me, actually,

25:27.320 --> 25:30.920
that's unhealthy or not.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.440
You like that she popoos you.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.480
That's give me more moms.

25:35.480 --> 25:41.040
Yeah, like don't ever cross the threshold where you're like,

25:41.040 --> 25:43.680
I saw it, I saw community.

25:43.680 --> 25:44.360
You're brilliant.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.360
Yeah.

25:45.360 --> 25:48.040
And then it's like, well, so tell me what you're saying.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.680
I don't like it when my gardener bitch is too much.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.840
And then they're like, OK, interesting.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.400
I loved community a little bit.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.520
But now it's real.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.080
I don't know.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.800
Like it just feels like I would cross the threshold.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.640
You want permission to be ugly, so you don't want to be up on it.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.400
Yeah, and I like it.

26:01.400 --> 26:06.480
I like that I like in air quotes, but I don't like it.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.400
But because I complained about it, I'm like, this bitch,

26:10.400 --> 26:12.880
all she got to do is watch the Rick and Morty.

26:12.880 --> 26:13.640
Right.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.000
But then I think about it and go, if she did,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.600
and she was like, I did it, and I watched Rick and Morty.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.600
Sit down.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.640
Let's talk more about your feelings.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.120
I think something would, I think there

26:26.120 --> 26:28.600
would be a membrane cross that would like,

26:28.600 --> 26:29.720
I think I wouldn't.

26:29.720 --> 26:33.320
Well, you'd be her entertainment Santa Claus.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.720
And you don't want to break her heart by being like,

26:35.720 --> 26:39.760
I jerked off to a photo of my grandfather.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.800
I think it's, I think I never thought about it in those terms,

26:42.800 --> 26:47.000
but you want to be a new season.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.080
I think I, well, to the people that watch the show.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.000
Yeah, that's right.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.560
Yeah, you don't want to mix the two.

26:53.560 --> 26:59.560
Santa wants a Jewish therapist, is what I'm saying.

26:59.560 --> 27:04.240
He wants to go and go, it's so nice to not have the pressure

27:04.240 --> 27:06.240
to be so fucking married.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.360
You know what I mean?

27:08.360 --> 27:10.240
I just covelled for a while.

27:10.240 --> 27:13.560
Yeah, Santa's therapist is Jewish.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.160
Or, you know, none.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.800
Yeah, no, it makes perfect sense.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.360
I never, it was more about like, I actually

27:22.360 --> 27:26.520
have a diseased part of me that thinks about,

27:26.520 --> 27:29.160
it's the part of me that wants people to like me.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.200
That makes me do things.

27:31.200 --> 27:34.360
So, oh, everybody like me, everybody like me.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.800
And then you think about it like, flip that piece,

27:36.800 --> 27:40.520
and that idea of like, oh, that person likes me,

27:40.520 --> 27:45.080
so I can put a pin in them, and I can focus on the world

27:45.080 --> 27:46.080
that doesn't like me.

27:46.080 --> 27:48.360
Yeah, move on to the other pieces.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.280
Do you have a relationship with that concept?

27:51.280 --> 27:52.440
Making people like me?

27:52.440 --> 27:55.440
An addiction to it, a horrible, like, explosion.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.280
Yeah, I used to be worse about being a people pleaser.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.440
I think, is that, do you relate to that term?

28:01.440 --> 28:03.120
Yeah, an approval addiction.

28:03.120 --> 28:05.840
Yeah, and then I sort of started to get over it.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.440
Therapy actually really helped with that.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.920
Like, my mother came over, we just had a baby,

28:09.920 --> 28:13.120
and the mom, the mom, the mom character, came over.

28:13.120 --> 28:18.600
She's played by Irina Holmes, she fucking, she's perfect.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.280
She comes over and she goes, we got you a,

28:21.280 --> 28:24.240
we bought baby Lila, we got her a book.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.240
It's an alphabet book, but it's cars, and I'm like,

28:29.240 --> 28:32.520
like, wow, that sounds like fucking bullshit.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.800
But thanks, and then she goes, but we left it

28:35.800 --> 28:40.800
in a diner in Pasadena, could you go get it for us?

28:41.960 --> 28:43.800
And we have a one month old baby,

28:43.800 --> 28:46.640
and I'll just laugh in her face.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.840
Not in a mean way, but in the nice way,

28:48.840 --> 28:50.520
you can laugh in someone's face,

28:50.520 --> 28:53.240
but I will say like, fucking no.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.600
That's not a gift, that's an errand.

28:57.800 --> 29:00.120
And I think there was a time pre-therapy

29:00.120 --> 29:02.720
before I knew what a boundary was to just be like,

29:02.720 --> 29:05.320
no mom, we're taking care of the baby.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.920
I hear that you like the book and you want me to like you,

29:07.920 --> 29:10.920
but we're not gonna drive to, and they made my brother do it.

29:10.920 --> 29:14.520
I wonder how much that boundary comes out,

29:14.520 --> 29:17.400
because it seems like, by and large,

29:17.400 --> 29:20.400
I don't wanna make a generalization that is unfair

29:20.400 --> 29:23.200
to anyone out there that needs to be arrested,

29:23.200 --> 29:28.200
but it seems like having kids tends to bring the best

29:28.200 --> 29:31.880
out of people, and God knows that's why probably

29:31.880 --> 29:33.200
a lot of people have kids that shouldn't,

29:33.200 --> 29:34.440
because they're like, you know what,

29:34.440 --> 29:39.440
I've seen how this works, but it does kind of elevate you

29:40.640 --> 29:43.320
in a way that is no conscious choice.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.280
Your kid is two months old now.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.120
Two months, yeah.

29:46.120 --> 29:49.080
Like you're the closest astronaut we have to orbit,

29:49.080 --> 29:50.920
if we don't have kids, it'll be like,

29:50.920 --> 29:52.160
how much of this shit is real?

29:52.160 --> 29:55.400
Does it come out and alter you?

29:55.400 --> 29:57.560
Well, I will say that people say it makes you

29:57.560 --> 30:01.120
understand your parents more.

30:01.120 --> 30:01.960
No way.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.360
Ah!

30:03.360 --> 30:05.080
They're just like, it will make you,

30:05.080 --> 30:08.160
you'll call your mom and be like, thank you so much.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.040
I'm like, straight Chris Rock about it.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.480
I'm like, yeah, you did what you were supposed to do.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.080
You had a baby, fucking feed the baby.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.080
I, maybe I'm in the minority,

30:17.080 --> 30:19.360
or maybe you just are young and don't give a fuck.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.320
That's what I've noticed, is nobody gives a shit

30:21.320 --> 30:22.480
about your baby.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.760
No one cares, especially in L.A.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.320
Except for other baby people,

30:28.320 --> 30:29.920
and they care too much.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.360
I will say, it did ruin porn.

30:34.360 --> 30:35.200
Go on.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.720
Well, I tried to watch porn, she's a girl,

30:38.720 --> 30:40.000
but it doesn't even matter, she's a baby,

30:40.000 --> 30:41.320
as a person, and then you start thinking

30:41.320 --> 30:42.960
about how all people were babies.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.840
I'm not trying to, I'm not like anti-porn,

30:44.840 --> 30:45.680
but it did ruin it.

30:45.680 --> 30:46.520
Then I watched porn.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.880
You think about body parts differently,

30:48.880 --> 30:50.640
you think about breasts differently.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.680
I'm glad you brought that up because I like it.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.520
So I watch a lesbian scene and I'm like,

30:53.520 --> 30:56.920
oh, she's got a good latch.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.800
What?

31:00.800 --> 31:04.000
Oh, what does that mean?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.480
It's when a baby's breastfeeding,

31:05.480 --> 31:06.800
it gets a good hookup.

31:06.800 --> 31:07.640
Oh!

31:07.640 --> 31:08.640
You know, like when Eric, Eric?

31:11.080 --> 31:12.800
But like pornography,

31:14.080 --> 31:16.960
pornography is weird because sex is to make a baby.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.400
I'm not saying it can't be for pleasure,

31:18.400 --> 31:21.800
but the point of it, evolutionarily, is to make a baby.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.160
But you never see that in pornography.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.120
That's weird.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.120
Right, that would be a,

31:26.120 --> 31:29.680
it's a time-consuming fetish to cater to.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.520
That's right.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.120
It involves all those time-lapse,

31:33.120 --> 31:35.440
and that's like, I'm sure it will.

31:35.440 --> 31:40.440
Check out Rocco Safredi and Chania Boobs a lot.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.960
Like, there's more turnover with the women,

31:42.960 --> 31:43.800
so I don't know.

31:43.800 --> 31:44.640
Chania Boobs a lot.

31:44.640 --> 31:48.600
And like, watch them, watch them raise a little adult.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.120
I think that's one of the, not to be gross,

31:51.120 --> 31:53.000
but I think that's one of the reasons why

31:53.000 --> 31:54.880
the guy never, sorry, this is gross.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.680
He never finishes in.

31:56.680 --> 31:57.640
Right.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.880
I think guys like that on a certain level,

31:59.880 --> 32:03.000
you're like, that's hot, and very responsible.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.600
Like you're kind of like, because like-

32:05.600 --> 32:07.280
Well, I think it, I think, I think it,

32:07.280 --> 32:08.200
I think it's the same thing,

32:08.200 --> 32:10.840
but I think it's like psychologically men

32:10.840 --> 32:12.360
that on a primal level,

32:12.360 --> 32:17.200
you think of finishing in as

32:18.200 --> 32:20.600
crossing a threshold into connection.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.440
Choice.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.260
Oh, that's true.

32:22.260 --> 32:27.260
And everything being exterior comforts the primal male,

32:27.280 --> 32:29.080
who's like, all I want to do is think about sex.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.920
And that's like a big, the big celebration.

32:31.920 --> 32:36.760
Cause what is, what is really sexy about the image?

32:36.760 --> 32:38.920
You know, like everyone agree

32:38.920 --> 32:41.160
that it's definitely something we project onto it.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.880
It's not the Bellagio like,

32:43.880 --> 32:45.760
phones that like doesn't look pretty.

32:45.760 --> 32:48.320
But like, it's sort of, I think it like,

32:48.320 --> 32:50.640
it's, we celebrate it as like-

32:50.640 --> 32:51.480
Well, I think there's-

32:51.480 --> 32:53.800
There, see, and I didn't clean my room.

32:53.800 --> 32:54.960
I did the opposite.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.040
Yeah, no, it's rebellious.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.920
And you're also wasting it.

32:57.920 --> 32:59.600
Yeah, I'm wasting it, I'm wasting it.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.720
Yeah, that's, it's like, yeah.

33:01.720 --> 33:04.600
I only watch porn where the guy comes into a wood chipper.

33:04.600 --> 33:09.600
I just want to see that Fargo blast of steam.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.680
He comes into it, dude.

33:11.680 --> 33:12.520
Oh!

33:12.520 --> 33:17.520
Oh! That's the only way I can come.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.920
He comes into a tiny capsule

33:21.920 --> 33:25.080
and it gets loaded into a rocket and shot

33:25.080 --> 33:28.160
to a planet guaranteed to never make use of it.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.360
That would make men like really happy.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.040
I used to have a joke about it though.

33:33.040 --> 33:36.280
It's weird that you never finish in the vagina.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.440
And, but the point evolutionary is to make a baby.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.120
That would be like inviting someone over to your house

33:41.120 --> 33:42.440
to make a cake.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.080
And you're like, you want to, you want to make a cake

33:44.080 --> 33:45.000
on Saturday?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.320
They're like, yeah, let's make a cake.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.640
And then you get a, you come over on this cake day,

33:48.640 --> 33:50.960
you get a big bowl and you put milk and cream

33:50.960 --> 33:52.960
and eggs in the bowl and sugar and you whip it up

33:52.960 --> 33:54.560
and you're like, we're making a fucking cake, aren't we?

33:54.560 --> 33:57.120
And you're like, yeah, we're making a fucking cake.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.120
And you preheat the oven, but at the last second

33:59.120 --> 34:00.120
instead of putting it in the oven,

34:00.120 --> 34:01.920
you just throw it in their face.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.120
Just like, boom!

34:06.000 --> 34:07.960
No cake today!

34:07.960 --> 34:10.040
Look in the camera and say bang bros.

34:10.040 --> 34:15.040
Look in that camera and say bang bros, baking edition.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.720
And I think part of the perversion of the male mind

34:21.720 --> 34:24.400
is like, and nobody's being a dad today.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.520
Yeah, no, honestly, I mean, don't you think

34:26.520 --> 34:27.360
that's really it?

34:27.360 --> 34:29.440
No, the first time, my wife and I were trying

34:29.440 --> 34:31.680
to have a baby and the first time you do it,

34:31.680 --> 34:32.960
some guys love it.

34:32.960 --> 34:36.720
Some guys who aren't trying to have a baby do it in there.

34:36.720 --> 34:39.920
It was a first for me when I was trying

34:39.920 --> 34:40.760
to get pregnant.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.560
I'm incredibly privileged.

34:42.560 --> 34:47.400
I've had a string of partners who are always doing

34:47.400 --> 34:51.400
this extra shit for me that I don't,

34:53.400 --> 34:56.000
the pill is a big deal for her.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.040
But it's like, yeah.

34:57.040 --> 34:57.880
Somebody said that.

34:57.880 --> 35:00.920
Somebody went birth control, which I get,

35:00.920 --> 35:04.480
but why not give it an assist?

35:04.480 --> 35:06.760
You listen to them?

35:06.760 --> 35:08.160
I listen to them sometimes.

35:08.160 --> 35:12.640
That is going to lead to a, yeah.

35:12.640 --> 35:17.240
But you have girlfriends that explain their history

35:17.240 --> 35:18.680
with the pill.

35:18.680 --> 35:22.280
I'll be absolutely confessional and be like,

35:22.280 --> 35:24.760
there's so much entitlement there.

35:24.760 --> 35:31.920
Because of my history of, I'm encountering female partners

35:31.920 --> 35:35.800
and their history involves them being totally

35:35.800 --> 35:38.560
used to taking a pill.

35:38.560 --> 35:42.200
But then you meet, you have, then you go like,

35:42.200 --> 35:43.920
oh yeah, well my period gets all fucked up

35:43.920 --> 35:45.200
or I go through a lot of shit.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.400
I don't know.

35:46.400 --> 35:49.360
If men took the pill, it would be 99% of standup.

35:49.360 --> 35:52.640
It would be, yeah.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.440
That it's bullshit that we have to take the pill.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.920
And it's like, my dick, it moves to the left now.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.320
Used to go to the right.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.320
I break out.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.560
I forget to take it.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.880
I panic.

36:01.880 --> 36:04.160
Four of them are sugar, and I'm trying to do no sugar

36:04.160 --> 36:07.040
right now.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.120
No, it's fucking insane.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.440
And my wife just had the baby.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.640
And then she's like, we're talking about birth control.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.720
Because you can get pregnant pretty much right away

36:13.720 --> 36:14.720
afterwards.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.680
And she was like, well, I can either take the pill

36:16.680 --> 36:20.800
and have my hormones completely fucked, potentially.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.760
Or we could become Amish, like another one comes right.

36:24.760 --> 36:25.360
Yeah, exactly.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.760
Or you can get an IUD, which, as I understand it,

36:27.760 --> 36:31.760
is like a mouth harp that a hillbilly is just like,

36:31.760 --> 36:33.400
Thank you for being politically correct.

36:33.400 --> 36:37.560
Dang, dang, dang, y'all, you want this to stop the babies?

36:37.560 --> 36:39.520
And then you have to like, apparently, you have to like,

36:39.520 --> 36:42.920
get all your hand up there and put it in the pelvis.

36:42.920 --> 36:43.680
And then it works.

36:43.680 --> 36:47.960
And medicine is like, we don't even know why.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.800
It's just a hillbilly's mouth harp.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.080
Get it up in you.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.400
We stopped changing the shape when people stopped

36:53.400 --> 36:53.920
getting pregnant.

36:53.920 --> 36:54.600
That's right.

36:54.600 --> 36:57.440
For all we know, it's supposed to be shaped like.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.440
Also, people got tired of fucking hearing

36:59.440 --> 37:02.760
camptown racist.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.120
I couldn't get it out clean.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.720
That was excellent.

37:05.720 --> 37:08.880
Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang.

37:08.880 --> 37:12.400
Do the only song you can play.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.440
There's three IUDs.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.560
There's Tricky and the Straw.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.440
There's Captain Races.

37:16.440 --> 37:19.040
And there's, I think, a little brown jug.

37:19.040 --> 37:26.800
But my point is, if there's a pill, Dan, I give you a pill

37:26.800 --> 37:30.400
and you won't turn into a zombie if it bites you, right?

37:30.400 --> 37:32.960
And then you go out to eat with a zombie

37:32.960 --> 37:34.840
and he's going to bite you.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.120
But you've had a nice time.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.440
Wouldn't you just stop him from biting you?

37:38.440 --> 37:41.120
Wait, no, wait, I want to access the metaphor.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.880
I made so much more sense in my head.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.200
What I'm saying is.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.320
Let's take that from the top.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.440
Take it from the top.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.080
Finish.

37:48.080 --> 37:48.600
I'm sorry.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.240
There's a pill that makes you proved again.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.000
What I'm saying is, why not pull out?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.040
Yes, the pill works.

37:54.040 --> 37:56.920
But wouldn't it work better if that stuff isn't even in there?

37:56.920 --> 37:57.420
Right.

37:57.420 --> 38:00.960
So there's a pill that the zombie bite won't make you a zombie.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.760
But why not just be like, hey, don't fucking bite me

38:02.760 --> 38:08.320
because we're having a great time tiddy fucking anyway.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.360
You're saying we owe it to our partners

38:10.360 --> 38:12.280
to pull out and come on them.

38:12.280 --> 38:12.880
Yes.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.400
We owe it to them.

38:14.400 --> 38:19.080
Or just come into a wood chipper and fucking.

38:19.080 --> 38:23.080
They should make little mini bedside wood chippers.

38:23.080 --> 38:26.000
They do.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.200
Petehomes.com.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.080
The undominator.

38:31.080 --> 38:35.320
I'm just saying, is it that much better to leave it in?

38:35.320 --> 38:37.080
I don't think so.

38:37.080 --> 38:42.320
Honestly, I have to say, it truly is.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.320
No, no, no, no, no, no.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.520
You didn't let me finish my sentence.

38:45.520 --> 38:50.320
No, I have to say, it truly is a matter of laziness.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.880
Like, absolutely.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.600
Like, men would not.

38:53.600 --> 38:56.880
I can't be pulling out all day long.

38:56.880 --> 38:57.760
How do I lose the weight?

38:57.760 --> 38:59.320
I'm doing the pull out method.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.280
I'm using my eyes to take it slow.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.440
Burns a lot of cows.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.640
I will speak for myself and say, definitely,

39:05.640 --> 39:10.960
if Cody being on the pill was also.

39:10.960 --> 39:14.120
Are you really on the pill?

39:14.120 --> 39:18.360
If she was like, also, it's only this and that effective

39:18.360 --> 39:22.000
and it would be helpful to the couple if you also pulled out,

39:22.000 --> 39:23.600
then I would pull out.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.840
But I would use the excuse of, it's

39:26.840 --> 39:29.120
like you get on a train and there's a bar car

39:29.120 --> 39:32.800
and you're like, that means I should drink.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.880
No one told you you should.

39:34.880 --> 39:38.400
But you're like, no one's telling me I shouldn't.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.840
And so leaving it in is like, that to me is like the line.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.720
It's like, if anyone asked me to, I would.

39:43.720 --> 39:46.320
I would call your lifestyle Golden Corral.

39:46.320 --> 39:54.000
Like that should be on your business card.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.960
Do you think there will ever be a million man march for me?

39:56.960 --> 39:59.120
For you, I think it's on the way.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.800
You're in the pill.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.440
But what's that?

40:02.440 --> 40:03.080
All right, so.

40:03.080 --> 40:03.880
Pills in you.

40:03.880 --> 40:10.240
So you've been at your profession for,

40:10.240 --> 40:13.880
I'm not going to say a long time, that would be unsexy.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.080
No, but it's been 20 years.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.400
You're a fucking warrior.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.360
You've been doing stand-up.

40:18.360 --> 40:22.080
You gracefully, if not acrobatically,

40:22.080 --> 40:24.280
plunged into the podcast medium.

40:24.280 --> 40:27.920
You also survived then into the streaming thing

40:27.920 --> 40:30.760
and your prestigious pay cable.

40:30.760 --> 40:31.840
What's your secret?

40:31.840 --> 40:35.960
I was kind of like, I thought I'd come up with a question.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.320
And then I was like, what question would that be?

40:38.320 --> 40:39.200
What's your secret?

40:39.200 --> 40:40.400
Would really be the only question.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.320
What is your secret?

40:41.320 --> 40:43.560
No, but I don't know what my question would be.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.880
I want to make that observation.

40:44.880 --> 40:47.320
You're like, you're a survivor.

40:47.320 --> 40:50.560
I will say, though, that it didn't, if it means anything

40:50.560 --> 40:52.480
to the audience.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.560
You have to lift with your legs.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.320
I once drew a New Yorker cartoon.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.200
It was two spiders.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.880
And there were just circles with lots of legs coming out

41:00.880 --> 41:01.600
of them.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.480
And the caption was, lift with your legs,

41:04.480 --> 41:06.520
not the one part of you that's not legs.

41:09.520 --> 41:11.560
That was my problem when I was a cartoonist.

41:11.560 --> 41:14.360
Every cartoon I handed them, I was like, that's fucking better

41:14.360 --> 41:16.000
than everything you run.

41:16.000 --> 41:16.840
Wait, did you submit?

41:16.840 --> 41:18.840
It was better than everything you run.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.960
Were you submitting as a contest entry?

41:21.960 --> 41:25.040
No, no, I've been in the New Yorker four times.

41:25.040 --> 41:28.520
And you've been in a New Yorker caption?

41:28.520 --> 41:29.200
I know.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.000
I know.

41:30.000 --> 41:30.800
Nobody cares.

41:30.800 --> 41:31.520
It's like my baby.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.320
Nobody cares.

41:33.320 --> 41:34.480
They care.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.320
And I do, too.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.480
Because I have friends who are obsessed with that.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.600
And they'll like email, they'll forward emails and go,

41:39.600 --> 41:41.080
guys, we got this.

41:41.080 --> 41:41.960
Oh, the caption?

41:41.960 --> 41:42.800
And I will sit there.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.120
You know what's funny about it is they probably do.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.920
I know the cartoon editor, the old cartoon editor.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.200
And he told me that for the caption contest,

41:50.200 --> 41:53.280
it's like 80% of the time people submit

41:53.280 --> 41:55.320
what the caption was.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.240
Oh, really?

41:56.240 --> 41:57.400
Yeah, there's a correct answer.

41:57.400 --> 41:59.080
Oh, they take the caption off?

41:59.080 --> 41:59.520
Yes.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.280
Oh, is it just a shitty cartoon?

42:01.280 --> 42:02.640
It's not a shitty cartoon.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.280
It's probably a more visual cartoon.

42:04.280 --> 42:07.120
But they don't run the people that got it right.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.880
They have to do the other one, right?

42:08.880 --> 42:10.480
No, well, they have three finalists.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.600
And one of them is definitely the one that was right.

42:12.600 --> 42:13.080
Oh, really?

42:13.080 --> 42:15.880
But every cartoon, as I've known, that's had it in there,

42:15.880 --> 42:17.880
usually the winner is what they probably run.

42:17.880 --> 42:18.360
God damn it.

42:18.360 --> 42:21.360
This is a fucking revolution.

42:21.360 --> 42:22.320
If anyone is listening.

42:22.320 --> 42:26.520
I'm here to drop some upper middle class knowledge.

42:26.520 --> 42:29.960
Do you own a beret or a turtleneck?

42:29.960 --> 42:33.720
I'm ready to fucking blow your dick off, dude.

42:33.720 --> 42:37.120
Do you remember Phil Ward, Dan, from LA Comedy Sports?

42:37.120 --> 42:38.560
Yeah.

42:38.560 --> 42:41.000
This is before New Yorker.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.160
It's not before the New Yorker.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.120
Look, we're all hooked at Phil Waradam.

42:44.120 --> 42:44.620
OK.

42:47.620 --> 42:51.800
Oh, man, if I was in the audience, I would have loved that.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.200
There's a little Phil Waradam humor.

42:54.200 --> 42:55.200
He's probably listening.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.400
Now I feel bad.

42:56.400 --> 42:56.920
I know.

42:56.920 --> 42:59.960
Well, he just drew a two-panel comic strip that really

42:59.960 --> 43:00.800
made me really laugh.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.880
And it was in one panel, like reading left to right,

43:03.880 --> 43:07.120
there was a pair of dice.

43:07.120 --> 43:10.320
And the second panel was completely empty.

43:10.320 --> 43:15.160
And the title said idioms explained.

43:15.160 --> 43:20.240
And it said dice, no dice.

43:20.240 --> 43:24.440
Fucking, I was like, that's fucking beautiful.

43:24.440 --> 43:27.400
I like it OK.

43:27.400 --> 43:27.960
I'll tell you.

43:27.960 --> 43:29.720
But you didn't see how funny the dice were.

43:29.720 --> 43:30.560
Yeah, that's true.

43:30.560 --> 43:31.060
That's true.

43:31.060 --> 43:35.080
What number were they on, 69?

43:35.080 --> 43:36.480
How do you have a nine on a dice?

43:36.480 --> 43:40.560
You've never played D&D, bro.

43:40.560 --> 43:44.600
Oh, I'll tell you.

43:44.600 --> 43:47.920
I thought it was a throw to you wanting to play D&D with us.

43:47.920 --> 43:50.000
That's what you'd play?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
No, that's what I had queued up there.

43:52.000 --> 43:52.520
I like it.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.960
My favorite cartoon that made me want to be a New Yorker

43:54.960 --> 43:57.400
cartoon is Bruce Eric Kaplan, who's a Seinfeld

43:57.400 --> 43:59.480
writer, great TV writer.

43:59.480 --> 44:00.680
He was a guy.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.360
It's very New Yorker, so we're not going to laugh.

44:02.360 --> 44:05.720
We're going to laugh like this.

44:05.720 --> 44:10.120
Like, don't move your face and swirl a branding.

44:10.120 --> 44:12.960
We have a walk in fireplace like that sort of laugh.

44:12.960 --> 44:16.240
A walk in fireplace?

44:16.240 --> 44:17.400
I can clear it.

44:17.400 --> 44:21.080
The height of class.

44:21.080 --> 44:22.920
A walk in fireplace.

44:22.920 --> 44:25.320
If you're not shit, if you don't have a walk in fireplace.

44:25.320 --> 44:28.360
You mean your house is on fire.

44:28.360 --> 44:30.720
And they're like, no, it never burns down.

44:30.720 --> 44:31.640
That's the point.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.720
We're bragging.

44:33.720 --> 44:35.640
I have a walk in fire.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.840
He says it's a man talking to it.

44:37.840 --> 44:39.280
It's at a cocktail party.

44:39.280 --> 44:40.720
He's talking to a skeleton.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.320
Skeleton's not holding a drink or anything.

44:42.320 --> 44:43.880
It's just standing like neutral.

44:43.880 --> 44:46.720
And the guy is saying, so Helen tells me you're dead.

44:49.840 --> 44:52.000
That's 10 out of 10.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.040
That's as good as it gets.

44:54.040 --> 44:55.560
I love that.

44:55.560 --> 45:00.600
My favorite cartoon that I drew that they didn't buy

45:00.600 --> 45:01.960
was an avocado.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.040
And she had long eyelashes.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.680
You could tell it was a lady avocado.

45:04.680 --> 45:07.440
She was crying, talking to a male avocado.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.960
And she's saying, what do you mean I'm the good kind of fat?

45:13.680 --> 45:15.760
They didn't buy it.

45:15.760 --> 45:17.240
That's fantastic.

45:17.240 --> 45:20.640
They didn't buy it.

45:20.640 --> 45:25.080
Do you have any idea the creative rage I still feel?

45:25.080 --> 45:25.920
I'm mad, too.

45:25.920 --> 45:28.600
And I was born in Wisconsin.

45:28.600 --> 45:33.200
And I have dirt still in my pants from the farm.

45:33.200 --> 45:36.000
And I know a good New Yorker cartoon when I hear it was.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
That's a good one.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.440
You've done good.

45:38.440 --> 45:41.440
But the ones that they bought, there was a guy in therapy

45:41.440 --> 45:42.760
and he said, I think I accidentally

45:42.760 --> 45:45.880
repressed my good memories.

45:45.880 --> 45:47.560
That was the first one.

45:47.560 --> 45:51.040
The second one was a dog real estate agent.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.480
How do you draw that first off?

45:52.480 --> 45:53.960
Well, it's like you, but a dog head.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.160
Like it's a human.

45:55.160 --> 45:56.760
No, no, no.

45:56.760 --> 45:58.440
Who the fuck is that supposed to be?

45:58.440 --> 45:59.080
Oh, OK.

45:59.080 --> 45:59.720
A guy in a suit.

45:59.720 --> 46:00.080
Yeah, yeah.

46:00.080 --> 46:02.120
The part of you you'd be insulted is if I was like,

46:02.120 --> 46:08.400
you're fucking face dog shit, that's the insult.

46:08.400 --> 46:11.160
Like the bottom part of you, you're less sensitive about.

46:11.160 --> 46:11.880
All right.

46:11.880 --> 46:13.960
Human body suit, dog head.

46:13.960 --> 46:17.040
I feel nothing from the neck down anyway.

46:17.040 --> 46:19.960
And he's talking to a dog couple in front of a house

46:19.960 --> 46:21.280
that says sold.

46:21.280 --> 46:25.560
And he's saying, well, the down payment's cleared

46:25.560 --> 46:26.880
and the paperwork is filed.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.920
As soon as you pee on the lawn, the place is yours.

46:28.920 --> 46:32.680
These are great.

46:32.680 --> 46:34.280
I mean, we'll always got in.

46:34.280 --> 46:35.240
I appreciate it.

46:35.240 --> 46:36.000
Wait, but wait.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.080
They weren't my best, though.

46:37.080 --> 46:38.440
They were the four that they bought.

46:38.440 --> 46:41.520
I want to know how do you break into that?

46:41.520 --> 46:44.040
I love telling people this because it's hilarious.

46:44.040 --> 46:47.880
The cartoon meeting, I love forecasting how things

46:47.880 --> 46:51.680
I'm about to say will go.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.560
I don't think it's like, ha, ha, hilarious.

46:53.560 --> 46:55.480
People are like, you have something like that.

46:55.480 --> 46:59.520
You're going to go like, what?

46:59.520 --> 47:01.480
What's hilarious about it is that the cartoon meeting

47:01.480 --> 47:04.520
at the New Yorkers at Tuesdays, I think it's at 11 AM,

47:04.520 --> 47:07.120
and anyone can go.

47:07.120 --> 47:08.120
That's what's hilarious.

47:08.120 --> 47:10.440
Meaning anyone listening, anyone here,

47:10.440 --> 47:14.200
go to the CondÃ© Nast building, go up to the counter

47:14.200 --> 47:16.200
with some cartoons and say, I'm here for the cartoon meeting.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.720
Are you fucking kidding me?

47:17.720 --> 47:18.920
What?

47:18.920 --> 47:21.960
And that is my little revenge for not buying the avocado

47:21.960 --> 47:23.680
cartoon.

47:23.680 --> 47:26.080
What is the point of being the New Yorker?

47:26.080 --> 47:28.080
Well, maybe that maximizes the point because it's

47:28.080 --> 47:31.400
elitism because it's like, hey, they should say,

47:31.400 --> 47:32.840
here's your New Yorker cartoon.

47:32.840 --> 47:35.560
And then the subline should say, like,

47:35.560 --> 47:38.600
built atop a mountain of poor people's skulls.

47:38.600 --> 47:39.920
Of course.

47:39.920 --> 47:44.480
Here's the cartoon that beat out everyone else that wanted

47:44.480 --> 47:45.800
to poke a bear for a penny.

47:45.800 --> 47:46.720
Here's what you'll enjoy.

47:46.720 --> 47:47.200
Sorry.

47:47.200 --> 47:49.160
No, go ahead.

47:49.160 --> 47:51.600
What I think is interesting is, so you could go.

47:51.600 --> 47:54.840
So the first week that I went, I think I submitted cartoons

47:54.840 --> 47:57.600
for sure that are good enough to be in the magazine.

47:57.600 --> 47:59.800
I'm sorry to say that, but I'm like, these are good enough.

47:59.800 --> 48:02.240
The avocado one is fucking solid gold.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.240
Solid as a rock.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.080
But here's the thing.

48:06.080 --> 48:06.880
That was off mic.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.040
It must have been really loud.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.600
Oh my god.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.200
Let him out.

48:10.200 --> 48:10.680
Get in there.

48:10.680 --> 48:12.440
Clean your room, Jacob.

48:12.440 --> 48:13.840
That is fun.

48:13.840 --> 48:15.680
You're fun, Golden Corral.

48:15.680 --> 48:16.240
All right.

48:16.240 --> 48:26.240
I don't like the shift in status, but continue.

48:26.240 --> 48:28.680
Regained by calling it out.

48:28.680 --> 48:30.440
Yes, now I'm on top again.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.800
I am the meta-alpha.

48:31.800 --> 48:33.120
I love your meta-alpha.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.920
Golden Corral is a compliment, though, right?

48:34.920 --> 48:35.680
Yeah, he's just that.

48:35.680 --> 48:36.680
I don't remember.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.400
It kind of sounds like a fat joke.

48:38.400 --> 48:41.840
I mean it that you live life and you eat and you're fat.

48:41.840 --> 48:44.480
It was a good.

48:44.480 --> 48:47.960
But good save.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.000
No, no, no.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.600
But I mean, at the buffet of life, you're getting second.

48:52.600 --> 48:54.760
That's what I did.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.480
You're the good kind of fat.

48:56.480 --> 48:57.480
Oh!

48:57.480 --> 49:00.480
All right.

49:00.480 --> 49:03.480
That's why you're solid.

49:03.480 --> 49:04.480
Everyone's dancing.

49:04.480 --> 49:07.480
Solid as a rock.

49:07.480 --> 49:08.480
Spanking.

49:08.480 --> 49:10.480
And no loud changes.

49:10.480 --> 49:11.480
Dancing.

49:11.480 --> 49:12.480
Wow.

49:12.480 --> 49:13.480
I too.

49:13.480 --> 49:18.480
This just got written up on Splitsider.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.480
I don't know.

49:19.480 --> 49:25.480
Is there any room anymore for, could we ever make that?

49:25.480 --> 49:30.200
Is there anything a comedy podcast could do these days that would actually like end up

49:30.200 --> 49:36.480
in anyone's Apple news update with a headline that said, Pete Holmes just, like I said.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.480
Nothing good.

49:37.480 --> 49:38.480
The word just is.

49:38.480 --> 49:39.480
Yeah.

49:39.480 --> 49:47.480
And someone just did this and it was epic and you'll come your brain into your dick

49:47.480 --> 49:48.480
nose.

49:48.480 --> 49:50.480
Yeah, I know.

49:50.480 --> 49:56.880
Just this, normally newspapers would just be like, a guy does a thing that you don't

49:56.880 --> 49:57.880
care about.

49:57.880 --> 50:02.280
So it's on page four and it's all part of, that's why it's called a paper.

50:02.280 --> 50:08.680
And now everything is just like, just, just, someone just, this just, epic just.

50:08.680 --> 50:09.680
This just happened.

50:09.680 --> 50:14.280
Just, I can't, but you won't believe epic just.

50:14.280 --> 50:23.400
But a lot of it is just like, like, Tom Hanks's uncle just decided he's a DJ and it's only

50:23.400 --> 50:28.180
because actually that sounds, actually that's the bad example that is, that's great.

50:28.180 --> 50:32.360
That is a headline that I would, that's perfect.

50:32.360 --> 50:33.360
What I was going to say.

50:33.360 --> 50:34.360
All right.

50:34.360 --> 50:35.360
Yeah.

50:35.360 --> 50:36.360
You were, I didn't interrupt you.

50:36.360 --> 50:37.360
What I was going to say.

50:37.360 --> 50:38.360
No, no, you didn't interrupt.

50:38.360 --> 50:39.360
Go ahead.

50:39.360 --> 50:40.360
You're great.

50:40.360 --> 50:41.360
Keep talking.

50:41.360 --> 50:45.760
I think, I think you'll think this is interesting from showbiz, showbiz perspective.

50:45.760 --> 50:51.760
You could have the best cartoon in the world, the, a single panel cartoon, perfectly drawn,

50:51.760 --> 50:54.120
perfect caption, funniest caption in the world.

50:54.120 --> 50:58.280
You show it to anybody, any, 10 out of 10 people are going to shit their pants laughing

50:58.280 --> 50:59.280
at this cartoon.

50:59.280 --> 51:00.720
They won't buy it.

51:00.720 --> 51:05.800
The New Yorker has enough cartoons to never buy a cartoon again and they could run for

51:05.800 --> 51:06.800
50 years.

51:06.800 --> 51:07.800
Shut up.

51:07.800 --> 51:08.800
I'm going to get your backlog.

51:08.800 --> 51:09.800
Wait.

51:09.800 --> 51:10.800
So they don't want cartoons.

51:10.800 --> 51:11.800
They want cartoonists.

51:11.800 --> 51:15.360
So I said, I went in every day for six, every week for six months.

51:15.360 --> 51:18.120
That's hundreds of cartoons before they bought one.

51:18.120 --> 51:22.280
And that was even a Jack Ziegler rest in peace, one of the greats of the New Yorker put in

51:22.280 --> 51:25.800
a good word for me because I'm that kind of guy that'll go up to somebody and be like,

51:25.800 --> 51:28.600
hey, I'm new in town, help me.

51:28.600 --> 51:30.400
I'm a John Mulaney spiritual.

51:30.400 --> 51:31.800
I have a thousand questions.

51:31.800 --> 51:35.040
I don't, do they buy them or do they not?

51:35.040 --> 51:36.040
Are you saying?

51:36.040 --> 51:37.040
No, they'll bank some of them.

51:37.040 --> 51:40.200
They'll create an industry of everyone's always auditioning.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.680
So their supply never runs out and they don't have to pay for it.

51:42.680 --> 51:43.680
That's what you're saying.

51:43.680 --> 51:44.680
No, no, no.

51:44.680 --> 51:45.680
It's like wire image.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.920
There's a bank of all these photos and if they want to use one eventually.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.480
But they do pay for it.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.440
They pay when they use them or they pay them?

51:52.440 --> 51:55.120
No, they buy it and then they own it.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.960
And for the most part, they run them.

51:56.960 --> 52:00.600
But like, let's say you're an on salary cartoonist.

52:00.600 --> 52:04.080
You give me 300 cartoons, maybe we run 250 of them.

52:04.080 --> 52:07.440
Every year, we're getting 50 of your cartoons on the backlog and that's been happening since

52:07.440 --> 52:09.240
like 1909 when the magazine.

52:09.240 --> 52:10.240
Okay.

52:10.240 --> 52:20.000
So when all the cartoons were like, racist with the New Yorker was like, but you said

52:20.000 --> 52:22.760
you have like four cartoons published.

52:22.760 --> 52:23.760
Yeah.

52:23.760 --> 52:24.760
And they published all of them.

52:24.760 --> 52:25.760
Yeah.

52:25.760 --> 52:26.760
So are you bragging?

52:26.760 --> 52:27.760
No, no, no.

52:27.760 --> 52:33.800
Because you didn't have to do like five, I think it's more of the salary guys that might

52:33.800 --> 52:34.800
get archived.

52:34.800 --> 52:35.800
But they have these meetings.

52:35.800 --> 52:36.800
I'm sorry.

52:36.800 --> 52:37.800
I'm asking so many questions about this.

52:37.800 --> 52:38.800
It's a podcast.

52:38.800 --> 52:39.800
What is this?

52:39.800 --> 52:40.800
A podcast?

52:40.800 --> 52:46.040
It's just like, Pete Holmes just redefined podcast.

52:46.040 --> 52:49.800
This meeting that you're describing where they go like they open the doors and you're

52:49.800 --> 52:53.800
like, you could go to CondÃ© Nast and you show up and the people like come in and trench

52:53.800 --> 52:57.520
coats with like these books and go like, well, here's a guy fishing for a shark, but it's

52:57.520 --> 52:59.400
like Wall Street and like, right.

52:59.400 --> 53:03.440
Like is everyone just showing cartoons and some of them have like doves on their shoulders

53:03.440 --> 53:04.440
and.

53:04.440 --> 53:06.000
Well, you're picturing it not entirely wrong.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.280
Actually, there's a lot of like Connecticut train weirdos.

53:08.280 --> 53:12.080
I don't know why I said doves pigeons is Connecticut.

53:12.080 --> 53:13.080
Connecticut will take anything.

53:13.080 --> 53:20.120
I said, I said Connecticut train weirdos and he went now, Pete, did you ever want to be

53:20.120 --> 53:24.560
like a syndicated comic strip guy like like have a syndicated thing across like major

53:24.560 --> 53:25.560
papers across.

53:25.560 --> 53:28.720
Oh yeah, Calvin and Hobbes was a game change.

53:28.720 --> 53:29.720
Let's do it.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.720
Let's do a podcast first.

53:30.720 --> 53:34.640
Calvin provides a three panel comic strip.

53:34.640 --> 53:35.640
Okay.

53:35.640 --> 53:38.080
But is it like a funny or is it a slice of life?

53:38.080 --> 53:45.240
Well, it's probably going to be the latter slice of because we have to so let's get let's

53:45.240 --> 53:46.240
get a title.

53:46.240 --> 53:52.440
The title is good and butter good and butter good and butter.

53:52.440 --> 53:53.680
All right.

53:53.680 --> 54:00.600
It's because it's a husband and well, you can't say the name of it.

54:00.600 --> 54:01.600
Didn't tell me what it means.

54:01.600 --> 54:02.600
Oh, well, no.

54:02.600 --> 54:03.600
Okay.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.400
I didn't I didn't mean I was I thought, okay, all right.

54:05.400 --> 54:06.400
I didn't mean to slap.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.400
No, no, no.

54:07.400 --> 54:08.400
Let's find out why it's called good.

54:08.400 --> 54:09.400
But we're doing the panel.

54:09.400 --> 54:10.400
Hang on.

54:10.400 --> 54:11.400
Am I the third panel?

54:11.400 --> 54:12.400
Are you guys going to do?

54:12.400 --> 54:14.200
I thought we explained what's in each panel.

54:14.200 --> 54:20.280
Oh, no, no, no, here's the here's the rules to this new improv game that I made that if

54:20.280 --> 54:23.520
anybody uses they owe me money.

54:23.520 --> 54:25.800
That's how improv is.

54:25.800 --> 54:30.000
That's how they all made their millions because it goes from I'm rich off inventing freeze

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
tech.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.760
It goes from audience left to audience right.

54:34.760 --> 54:38.640
By the time you run out of stage space, you're out of comic panel, right?

54:38.640 --> 54:40.800
You get to do one line.

54:40.800 --> 54:46.480
And then if there's someone you're talking to, you do a line.

54:46.480 --> 54:47.800
And so it's like hieroglyphic.

54:47.800 --> 54:51.920
There's no so so I say like, I get it.

54:51.920 --> 54:55.680
Hey, I'm almost done with that lawnmower, right?

54:55.680 --> 55:01.840
And then I would be like, well, it took you all day to mow the damn grass.

55:01.840 --> 55:07.400
And then you and then you'd like draw a line and then now it's on me.

55:07.400 --> 55:09.560
This is panel two now.

55:09.560 --> 55:10.560
That's the tough part.

55:10.560 --> 55:12.560
Let's workshop that later.

55:12.560 --> 55:30.680
And then I'd go, listen, I've been noticing that you want me to work faster when I use

55:30.680 --> 55:38.720
your property.

55:38.720 --> 55:45.720
Are you telling the truth?

55:45.720 --> 55:52.720
It's a way and then it's a way I am in the Trump administration that you don't and you

55:52.720 --> 55:53.720
don't have to do anything.

55:53.720 --> 55:54.720
Then we did it.

55:54.720 --> 55:55.720
We did it.

55:55.720 --> 55:56.720
I don't know.

55:56.720 --> 55:57.720
All right.

55:57.720 --> 55:58.720
No.

55:58.720 --> 55:59.720
All right.

55:59.720 --> 56:00.720
All right.

56:00.720 --> 56:01.720
I liked it.

56:01.720 --> 56:02.720
Yeah.

56:02.720 --> 56:03.720
Otherwise it'd be hanging.

56:03.720 --> 56:04.720
You have to dry, right?

56:04.720 --> 56:07.560
If I was like, you tell me and then you'd be like, what the fuck am I going to say you're

56:07.560 --> 56:08.560
telling Fertilizer?

56:08.560 --> 56:09.560
Oh.

56:09.560 --> 56:10.560
All right.

56:10.560 --> 56:19.120
Well, no, no, no, it wasn't good, but I had a backup plan like pulling out when you're

56:19.120 --> 56:20.120
on the pill.

56:20.120 --> 56:21.120
Yeah.

56:21.120 --> 56:22.120
Yeah.

56:22.120 --> 56:26.560
That that was early good and butter, but do some of my favorite ones do some of my my

56:26.560 --> 56:27.560
classic classic.

56:27.560 --> 56:29.600
Can I ask a podcast question?

56:29.600 --> 56:30.600
Yeah.

56:30.600 --> 56:31.600
Yeah.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.960
Is there usually this much improv?

56:34.960 --> 56:35.960
It depends.

56:35.960 --> 56:38.760
Come out talking shit about your UCB training.

56:38.760 --> 56:42.680
No, we should we should get to the scripted part of the show.

56:42.680 --> 56:43.680
You're right.

56:43.680 --> 56:44.680
You're right.

56:44.680 --> 56:50.760
So Pete, I hear Blue Apron is the secret to your comedic success.

56:50.760 --> 56:51.760
Is that your sponsor?

56:51.760 --> 56:52.760
Oh, yeah.

56:52.760 --> 56:57.960
We love the caramelized pearl onions with peas cabbage.

56:57.960 --> 57:04.680
Did season three of crashing go so much good because you like the way you like them?

57:04.680 --> 57:06.920
Like the way people order Blue Apron?

57:06.920 --> 57:11.560
Well, what we do on crashing is we write a script and then we wrap it in that sounds

57:11.560 --> 57:15.480
great.

57:15.480 --> 57:20.400
Is it true they can get a discount if they use the code Pete Holmes dot Blue Apron dot

57:20.400 --> 57:21.400
slash.

57:21.400 --> 57:23.320
I don't think that'll do anything.

57:23.320 --> 57:24.320
Oh, yeah.

57:24.320 --> 57:28.000
No, that sounds that sounds like it'll it'll take your web browser to something.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.040
Blue Apron, eat your guilt about all that packaging away.

57:32.040 --> 57:35.320
Feel free to edit that out.

57:35.320 --> 57:36.600
I know what it's like having sponsored.

57:36.600 --> 57:37.600
Here's a real question.

57:37.600 --> 57:44.400
I wanted to ask you because you just had a two year old two month old to me.

57:44.400 --> 57:47.760
To me, babies are no younger than two years old.

57:47.760 --> 57:49.680
You just had a two year old.

57:49.680 --> 57:50.680
You're picturing it, right?

57:50.680 --> 57:51.680
You have a two month old.

57:51.680 --> 57:52.680
Yeah.

57:52.680 --> 57:53.680
Two months.

57:53.680 --> 57:55.400
Fresh fresh as the fucking morning bread.

57:55.400 --> 57:56.400
Where was she?

57:56.400 --> 58:01.240
You're like, but I assume I haven't watched your show.

58:01.240 --> 58:06.560
It sounds from the description that it's probably every television show ever made in

58:06.560 --> 58:08.960
that it's not you.

58:08.960 --> 58:17.360
Is it you doing stand up and it's it's the Mindy project, but you're a white dude.

58:17.360 --> 58:19.000
I'm just making a guess.

58:19.000 --> 58:26.560
We please put that on the DVD box like the Mindy project, but I'm a white dude and he's

58:26.560 --> 58:27.560
not a doctor.

58:27.560 --> 58:33.440
I also can't quite figure it out.

58:33.440 --> 58:37.400
Let me rephrase that.

58:37.400 --> 58:41.400
Is your show about a single dude finding life and love in a coastal city?

58:41.400 --> 58:45.400
Or is it your show about a dude who's already married and in either case, I have another

58:45.400 --> 58:46.400
question.

58:46.400 --> 58:47.400
Yeah.

58:47.400 --> 58:54.400
It was like disturbing how you kind of summarized all of TV just then because it's fair.

58:54.400 --> 58:55.400
Yeah.

58:55.400 --> 58:56.800
No, it's a guy who was married.

58:56.800 --> 58:57.800
It's based on me.

58:57.800 --> 58:58.800
I was married.

58:58.800 --> 59:04.520
When I was 28, my wife had an affair with a small Italian man named Rocco, which is a

59:04.520 --> 59:06.800
name you said earlier.

59:06.800 --> 59:07.800
Rocco Safridi.

59:07.800 --> 59:08.800
Yeah.

59:08.800 --> 59:09.800
As a porno name.

59:09.800 --> 59:10.800
Yeah.

59:10.800 --> 59:11.800
And big boobs, booby boobs or whatever.

59:11.800 --> 59:12.800
Yeah.

59:12.800 --> 59:13.800
Cause I didn't cause the turnover rate with.

59:13.800 --> 59:14.800
It was something.

59:14.800 --> 59:15.800
Something boobs a lot.

59:15.800 --> 59:16.800
I know that.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.800
Let's go all the way back round the corner.

59:18.800 --> 59:22.800
Fudge is made by me three.

59:22.800 --> 59:23.800
Okay.

59:23.800 --> 59:26.800
Your first wife left you for a fellow named Rocco.

59:26.800 --> 59:27.800
Yeah.

59:27.800 --> 59:28.800
Yeah.

59:28.800 --> 59:29.800
Yeah.

59:29.800 --> 59:30.800
Yeah.

59:30.800 --> 59:31.800
Rocco.

59:31.800 --> 59:32.800
Nice guy actually.

59:32.800 --> 59:33.800
I'm not just saying that.

59:33.800 --> 59:34.800
He was a really sweet guy.

59:34.800 --> 59:35.800
I really like him.

59:35.800 --> 59:38.800
So the show is kind of a flashback to a portrait of you.

59:38.800 --> 59:39.800
Yes.

59:39.800 --> 59:40.800
And you were single.

59:40.800 --> 59:41.800
You know, it's funny.

59:41.800 --> 59:45.200
A lot of TV and movies start with an affair.

59:45.200 --> 59:50.480
Our pilot has an affair, but I mean, you know, we talked about Joey Kams, Joseph Campbell.

59:50.480 --> 59:55.240
We need that inciting thing and in my case, my life really had that thing.

59:55.240 --> 59:57.560
I was in the shallow end of comedy.

59:57.560 --> 01:00:02.040
My wife leaves everything that I knew fell away and then I was like sort of forced into

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.800
the deep end and the concede is there are all these Obi-Wan type characters like Artie

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:13.040
Lang, Bill Burr, Sarah Silverman that sort of shepherd me and teach me because they think

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.040
it's sweet.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.080
A lot of people thought I was like a sweetie and they were like, isn't it, look at this

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:22.720
musical and he's religious and he's sweeter than the scene, we're going to help him out.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.720
That actually happened quite a bit.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.960
And so it's kind of like, but you're currently, you're partners with this person and now you've

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.120
created a life as of two months ago.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:39.320
My question has to do with having a successful show that's going to keep on running and now

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:46.280
as creators, our big fantasy is like, write what you know, write what you know and then

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:51.440
you create this thing and it's like, it's about us and it's about me and all this stuff.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:57.960
My question is always, how do you cope with that three seasons into it when you're now

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:05.560
coming home to a California king's eyes bed with a person who is like, what is the relationship

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:11.760
between you and your partner with the show?

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:18.080
When the show is about you, is it about, it's about you being single, right?

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.080
The show.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:23.920
The show is not about you being married, the show is about you dating, right?

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.120
I'm asking because I don't know.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.120
I feel like...

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.360
Golden corral, take it easy.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.920
I'm confirming that first of all.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.400
And then my question is like, does that cause, is it like, how does that work?

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.800
I think I hear you.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.240
I think I hear you.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:50.720
My show, my wife, my new wife, but Valerie, we've been married for almost a year now.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.760
We've been together for over five, six years and we have the baby and I'm currently making

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.360
a show reenacting my old marriage.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:05.080
And then also the girl, the woman who's one of our best friends as a couple, Jamie Lee,

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.720
who plays my girlfriend on the show is actually my ex-girlfriend.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.000
So when we talk about how spectacular and loving Valerie is, it's not that I'm just

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.560
like making believe of the past with actors, I'm actually making believe of the past with

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560
my ex-girlfriend.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.160
So she's tremendous.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.600
She's actually winning an Emmy this year, the support of wife Emmy.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600
Is that what you meant?

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:32.200
I kind of, but now I have eight more questions because like, wait, did you, is your ex-girlfriend...

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.720
Did that, do you think that answered his question?

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.840
No, because didn't you...

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.320
He didn't act like you were clear on his question.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:48.320
I listened to people for a living and that was like a tour through a Walmart that sold

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:57.080
words, but there was an earthquake.

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:04.040
I want to separate it from like, if I wanted to be like a thoughtful interviewer, I would

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.680
have watched the show and be like, no, but what do you think?

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.680
Don't feel that way.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:14.800
I'm saying as a creator who I assume, like you're doing a show, is the character named

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.200
Pete?

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.800
So is he a stand-up?

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.040
So that's my question is like, we all do that.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.040
We tell...

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.480
Does he jerk off to his grandpa?

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.480
That was him.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.480
Okay.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:36.160
And my question, I think you kind of, you could talk about this for more is like...

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.160
The more you drink, the more you sound like Robert Crumb.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:45.280
You can talk about this for a lot of comics.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:50.960
Is that, just that general area, I don't have the smart question about it because I haven't

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.960
seen the show or...

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.960
You're doing wonderful.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.960
You can ask me anything.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.960
We're friends.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.960
Don't patronize me.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.360
I'm a good interviewer.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.480
You're doing great.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:10.880
It's just curious about your personal and if I'm prying, then you just go, don't pry,

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:18.560
but having a partner in your life, and you go, like, I've known, it's like 50 comics

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.920
who like every, so it's like my show is called Franklin.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.920
What's the show about?

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.120
Well, it's about the fact that I'm Franklin and their name is Franklin.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.680
And it's like, well, it's about growing up in the Bronx and being married to something.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.360
And it's like, well, okay, so a lot of that is obviously based on the things you talked

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:41.400
about in your act, and therefore now that's based on your life, and that's my curiosity

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:48.160
is these conversations that have to happen when you come home from work or you watch

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:56.320
something together and the challenges that your partner goes through where they're like,

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:02.040
is that about me, or is that about your cousin Amy, or what's going on here?

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.040
Or is that real?

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.040
Yeah.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.040
Did that happen?

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.040
Do you feel that way?

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:13.600
Yeah, I suppose the whole process, if I'm hearing you correctly, Pete, it was a yes

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.600
or no question.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.600
All right.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.600
All right.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600
Well.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:25.200
I feel like I could answer in the style in which I was asked.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:32.320
You know, when you're making a show like this that is oftentimes autobiographical, but not

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:36.960
without its fiction, you know, you take deviations into different roads and the roads become

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.720
avenues and some of them become cul-de-sacs and send you back the way you came.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.800
But when you're looking over that hill and there's somebody like your partner and they're

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.280
wondering, is this like, is this something we watch together?

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:53.760
Is this something like the Sopranos where we cook a meal and eat the meal and we watch

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.760
it?

01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:00.320
Or is it more like a theme show or a barbecue kind of night off of nudity?

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:05.880
And why do you keep coming in this wood chipper?

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:11.480
That's the best impression of me that I've always wanted.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.320
I'm like, James Adomian, will you ever do an impression of me?

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.720
It's like, no, I would never dirty my hands with that.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.840
That was the first impression I would have made of me, and that was fantastic.

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:20.840
Is that right?

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.840
Somebody sent me a clip of someone, was it you?

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.560
It's fine if it was, doing an impression of me on this podcast.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.560
I don't think so.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560
Any die-hard fans remember that?

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.720
If I did an impression of you, it would be like, I'm a great guy.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.640
It was very sweet, actually.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.640
It was somebody...

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.480
Do you want a vegan cookie?

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.600
I have a show on HBO.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.360
Hey, it's me.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.360
It's me.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.720
I'm Pete Holmes.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:51.480
If I don't seem very dimensionalized, it might be because you have clinical narcissism.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.360
Maybe you don't see anybody as so human.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.840
Oh, that's so fun.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.280
Maybe everyone's a color for him, do you?

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.680
That is brutally honest.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.400
The first time I met you, I think, we were doing Douglas movies at the UCB, and it was

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.920
me, you, and Bill Burr.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.920
And I'd never met you.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.000
That's my Bill Burr impression.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
That's really good.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.720
No, no, I'm serious.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.440
I don't watch any current movies.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.440
My knowledge of movies is way old, so I'm not going to be good at it.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.920
And Doug is smoking weed in the back, of course.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.680
Suspend your disbelief for that part.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.640
And I sit down and I meet Bill Burr.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.640
I'm like, oh, hey, Bill.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.640
And he goes, I'm Jeff.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.200
He goes, hey, how's it going?

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.140
And I go, he goes, hey, Jeff, we're doing a show at Pete Holmes, so you and I are never

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:45.640
going to talk.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640
And that's about right.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.840
But the thing was, it was the best thing in the world, because I don't know anything about

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.560
movies, like what's currently in theaters.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.560
Me either do I.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.600
But you just got up and just completely dominated the whole thing.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.800
I don't want to get to the game.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.800
Me neither.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.800
Yeah.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.640
But you took me, I didn't have to play the game, and my gift to the audience member

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:07.720
was a flask full of really nice whiskey, and that was my offer to whoever voted for

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.720
me at the end of the thing.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:09.720
Oh, that's fine.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:10.720
While you were talking.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.720
Did they get to keep the flask?

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.200
No, because while you were talking, Bill and I just opened it up and drank the entire

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.200
thing.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.200
Yeah.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.200
I remember that.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:23.200
I got a little drunk that show too, and afterwards Bill went, yeah, you had a little too much

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.720
Jesus juice.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.720
That's what he said.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.720
Yeah.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.360
I call that a threshold guardian.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.840
That's what Joseph Campbell would call it.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.880
Wait, did you call him Joey Camps earlier?

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.880
Joey Camps.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.880
Joey Camps.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.880
Yeah, Joey Camps.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880
Yeah.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.880
Joey Camps.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:40.880
Change my life, Joey Camps.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.880
That's what we had the chat about.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.880
I prefer my Pete Holmes.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.880
I don't think you talk too much at all.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.220
I think you talk just enough.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.220
That's very sweet.

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.920
And when I do Doug Loves movies, kind of like what you were actually asking me about crashing,

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.920
I think.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:57.600
There is a depersonalizing element of you become like, that's TV me, and this is me, me.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.480
Similarly on Doug Loves movies, that's Doug Loves movies me.

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.120
We all have these different modes.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.640
There's Thanksgiving you, there's a loan on the subway you, there's drunk at a party

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.640
you.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.640
In fact, maybe you'll relate to this.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.800
One of the reasons I don't like going to parties and getting stoned or whatever is because

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.600
I'm not that crazy about my personality.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:20.560
I love it, don't get me wrong, but I'll also come home and I'll be like, I told too many

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.560
stories.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.560
Right.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:26.040
Or maybe you joke off who you are, right?

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.120
I'll just say to Valence, this is why I like to keep it at home.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.120
Yeah.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.400
Dan and I, we've been doing this podcast for four million episodes and we've told the

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.600
same seven stories a hundred thousand times.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.600
For sure, yeah.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.600
Yeah.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.600
Well, that's why, you know, good entertainer.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.200
Good to know when to, but bad at a party.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.200
No, but we don't.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.720
You would have thought we would have learned that a long time ago.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.120
I keep telling the same five.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.880
No, we always forget right when we should, right when we're about to repeat the first

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.880
story.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.880
We forget.

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.880
No, I understand that.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:58.480
I sometimes worry on my podcast because we've done, I don't know, almost 400 episodes.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.640
There's anyone listening?

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.720
I mean, you could give me, you could give me feedback.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.280
I won't take it personally.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.520
Do you go like, he's going to tell them.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.040
He's about to do that story.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040
Right?

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040
I mean, I do too.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:18.400
I'm also there and I'm like, wow, it's like AI could make me from the podcast.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.200
You know what I mean?

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.200
If you say this, he's going to say that.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.960
This is, let's talk about that.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960
That's what I'm here.

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.240
That's what you just said about the party thing, like go to, like, why would I go to

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.720
a party and then you sit there and like, who are you?

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.440
Like, just.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:39.440
Which you.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:45.760
Do you constantly wonder that and do quote unquote normal people constantly wonder that

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:53.320
I keep playing a Hail Mary where I think I'm pretty sure quote unquote normal people,

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.120
AKA the people listening.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120
Although don't be so sure.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.120
I used to be exclusionary in my language and I was like comedians are like this or creative

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120
people are like this.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.960
Now I'm sure most of these people here can relate to this feeling.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:12.720
I just said that and you're high-roading me.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:20.400
I made that exception and I'm like, I'm saying like, I think that Pete, I'm hearing, I'm

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.400
listening.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.200
Well, I'm unclear.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.200
Deal with it.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.200
That's the point of the show.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.200
I'm unclear.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.200
That is beautiful.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.200
You can be unclear.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.200
It's not beautiful.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:44.960
No, no, God damn your UCB training.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:50.080
No, but that that was what I was trying to express.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.120
Is that like, like, oh, I look like God damn it.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.120
No, I can't.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:59.680
Now I keep hearing your impression of me and I'm afraid to start, but but but God damn

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.680
it.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.680
Yeah.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.440
No, I do most people wonder who they are.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.280
Do you think like regular jokes?

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.400
Does everyone basically essentially not know who they are?

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.600
I don't think so.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600
I think that's a no.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.600
They don't or yes, they know they don't.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.400
I wonder.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.680
I have some friends where I'm just like, no, that guy's just fucking like, I'm Ted.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.680
And he knows.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:22.680
And he knows.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.680
And he knows.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.680
And we love.

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.680
And we love Ted.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.200
Ted dies in a skiing accident.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.520
And then everyone's like, like there are good teds and bad teds like Ted Bundy.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:37.200
And then Ted, the stuff that was a good ten, like, like, like, sometimes it's like, oh,

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.280
that's why Ted, like shot that kid.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.800
I like it just feels like they just kind of switch automatically where if we got to go

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:44.800
wait a second.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.640
I'm going into a mall.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.440
Okay, mall got it.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.440
It's very basic.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.440
Other people just do it.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.400
They're like, yeah, I'm Ted.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400
Here we go.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.400
Ted in the mall.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400
Like it.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.400
Yeah, I love that every once in a while.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.400
Sleepy Martin star.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.680
Yeah, that's very flatter.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.680
It is.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.840
Because it means you how much weight you've lost.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.840
Oh man.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.840
Yeah, you agree.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:16.480
I would say like homeless fat guy from Game of Thrones or homeless fat guy from Lost.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480
I mean Martin star.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480
Jesus Christ.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.480
All of that way.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.480
That's a man.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.480
That's a thin man.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.000
He's actually here.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Spencer.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
So you're saying.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.560
I think we can probably all relate to that.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.480
Like if you're going, okay, I'm going into a Fourth of July party.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.680
I got to be Fourth of July party Spencer.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.480
Well, that's what I thought he was mentioning is that it's like, oh yeah, we're different

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.800
people in different situations, you know, we kind of we act differently depending on

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.640
who we're around and isn't Dan saying though underneath that we're going, but who am I

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.640
really?

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.640
Right?

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.640
Yeah.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.640
I don't think Ted is going.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.640
But who's Ted?

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.640
Really?

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640
Yes.

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.640
That's yeah.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.640
There are some people who are like, well, one thing.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.640
I know sure.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640
I'm Ted.

01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.640
I know these people.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:05.080
We all do around the time we hear these people are going, we wish you a Merry Christmas.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.000
We wish you a Merry Christmas and they're just like, they're just in they don't they

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
don't think how does this look they're just like now bring a stuff to keep holding there

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.160
in but but but but but some of the people doing that are are are us yeah and are going

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:24.000
to America and they're and they're like fucking I would lose Ted would like me.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.880
Like that's what complicate is like I think I think every double down I like I don't

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.280
actually know Ted's are like a calming influence right now I can then I don't I don't know

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.760
I actually prefer they're like just be a little bit racist.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.240
I think I think it helps.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:44.840
I think everything it keeps the braces out it helps on the road who do you keep an extra

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:51.960
eye on it keeps too many races from happening if you're a little bit racist oh my god there

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.520
are probably people that are like being racist keeps too many races from happening.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:01.880
What are you going to do be all these super race racer because if like a seven times

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:09.920
removed like this person as it yeah I yeah we're all I know is I wake up on a bed.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:17.160
I don't want it to change then I go to work if anyone tries to change my bed fuck them

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:24.320
like yeah it's like they're like right we we call them ribosomes in biological yeah

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.840
right they're like they maintain like they read the DNA I actually think that's brilliant

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.600
I often think of people in terms of cells because we're all just kind of doing what

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.760
cells do anyway like I'm just like one of those loud cells that's like floating around

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:42.640
just going like can I bond with you yeah like and don't you think I don't you think on a

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:53.240
playground without a Ted yeah be cancer yes yeah I need a Ted and then I'd be like whatever

01:15:53.240 --> 01:16:02.080
you say that's right I've got an HBO show president like we wouldn't know when to stop

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:08.280
but yeah heads go like what's with your shoes I heard those shoes aren't right yeah I'm

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:12.720
we're like fucking Ted's some Ted's like the white blood cells I just fucking regulate

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:19.760
I don't know what they are Ted's are like we got a nose to make Ted's Ted's gotta wake

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.720
up make that bed Ted's are mitigators that yeah it's some Ted's like like Joey cams

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:34.160
says that mythology has a dual function what one part of it is to teach kids to dream bigger

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:41.520
and one part is to dream smaller like it basically is but it's like taking adolescence and natural

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:48.360
anger their natural like desire to eat the fathers of the tribe and to direct it outward

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:54.920
yeah what you do with like Star Wars movies and you go who what hey what you turn in 13

01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:00.440
you thinking that maybe if you cut my head off you could be in charge of everything what

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:05.520
a crazy feeling you know Luke Skywalker felt like that but then he learned that Darth Vader

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:12.720
lives in a spaceship help me make these weapons yeah that that's a big part of mythology and

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:18.440
a tribal level is like directing anger outward like get it get this radiation out of the

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:23.720
power so it doesn't melt down and then the but then the other totally contradictory

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.400
part is you're trying to actually make people proud of themselves you're trying to tell

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:35.840
people don't let the shielding around this nuclear power plant close us in and and so

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:41.840
you're encouraging radiation while trying to figure out how to get out into the world

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:45.320
a healthy steam release you know I'll tell you something beautiful I this whole time

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.840
I was trying to remember who said it but unfortunately I can't remember his name but it's a Joseph

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:54.000
Campbell scholar who's talking about there's all these like teen suicides and he's like

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.320
what people need to realize is instead of like walking on a bridge and jumping off they

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.080
need to realize what part of them needs to die that they might continue to the other

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:11.120
side well the whole thing otherwise they wouldn't well that says that's what a suit but mythology

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.680
addresses youth angst and rage and anger and saying yeah fucking a you're right part of

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:22.440
you is going to die and part of you is going to be killed by you that's what all young

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:26.400
men yeah like when there's another part of you that goes forward and that's that's sometimes

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.360
missing especially from American stories that sometimes we're missing that second part yeah

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:37.240
if you create a societal mechanism that says to kids you're either going to be a doctor

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:42.440
a lawyer or a thief and they don't want to be any of the three they're gonna you're gonna

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:48.840
have a higher suicide rate than if you say to a kid here are some things that people

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:54.720
have been doctors and lawyers and thieves however yeah also you could be a wizard you

01:18:54.720 --> 01:19:00.680
could and part of you can be a wizard yeah I'm not even joking be a night or a wizard

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:10.600
or a skywalker of either yeah or a neo all right you guys getting these references can

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:16.000
you choose to be a neo though doesn't neo kind of get thrust upon you was neo really the

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.240
one google it what is that I always see I would see that headline and never click on

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:29.400
it like the reddit thing where I like have explained yeah I'm always like why I totally

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:35.400
accept that maybe he isn't yeah okay well you see there is a second layer to the matrix

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.680
that's designed for you to think you've escaped from the matrix and think that you're the

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:45.720
one and save in the day but that's just part of the matrix wait no is that in the

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:50.120
matrix though because that there's so many more matrix series that are more interesting

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:56.840
than the matrix right and that sounds like one of those well well he uses powers presumably

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.200
once when he's technically out of the matrix and people are like yeah how could that yeah

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.440
people are like well how could that happen unless they're in the matrix and then that

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.560
conspiracy theory yeah I think that's where that whole but they never answered that question

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:14.160
the second movie ends with why does he have powers in the in the real world and then the

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:20.840
third one when he just does right and that is the most disappointing I wrote my I don't

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:27.640
write fan fiction but I had this I had this whole ending what was I was laughing I don't

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:34.120
like fan figure what what was that I was I was enjoying the idea of a different me that

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:41.600
writes fan fiction like it's a simpler life by candlelight but I had this whole thing

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.920
where like I wanted I wanted Neo to be fighting agent Smith who they say is actually the one

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:55.440
right to unplug himself like that's enlightenment agent Smith no no I wanted Neo to be in in

01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.680
his inescapable position right where he needs to save Trinity or whoever but he's blocked

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:05.600
in and he can't get out so he realizes that he's just an assimilation and Neo in the real

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:11.000
world unplugs himself plugs himself back in in a new place and saves the day that seemed

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.480
like a good model of enlightenment they're always just like in the first are you saying

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:19.200
in the first movie in the third movie oh the third movie well that's what I'm saying I'm

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:24.040
trying to well yeah I know yeah I'm trying I'm saying like you're fixin a fucking duck

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:29.280
hunt that went from the marsh to the parking lot of a like I I'm like I watched all three

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:33.720
of them and I was like and the third one I'm like what the fuck what yeah that's why the

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:38.680
Pete Holmes fan fiction version yeah no I mean when he comes back he's in white why do people

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:45.920
think that it I honestly like I remember like he goes like awesome why do people think agent

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.040
Smith is actually the one because he's the one that gets the matrix shut down well because

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:54.520
the real ending was so bad they were like well this can't be what it was we have to have

01:21:54.520 --> 01:22:00.480
been missing something what if agent Smith is the one then it's great yeah that's where

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:06.080
all this stuff comes from it's like truly it all grows out of the ending being unsatisfying

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.320
I say this with a lot of love it feels like some pastor is trying to like breathe life

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:16.400
into the Old Testament yeah they're like it is cool you guys yeah it kind of it it reminds

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:24.160
me I've not to get political but the smart oh boy favorite smocking tweet of the I'm not

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:29.680
on Twitter so when I hear about something it means that it was fucking radioactive like

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:37.400
I'm like did the president say smocking it radiated out to me and then I was like I'm

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:42.880
not on Twitter I'm gonna go on Twitter because I want to find I want to find the guy with

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:49.880
the most followers who tried to make hay out of this sunshine and I that guy who was like

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:59.640
hey he's mocking you for believing in needing a smoking gun like hello I love that anyway

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:05.160
that is creative thinking but yeah like the mythology creating like you it's it's it's

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:11.720
the human storytelling it's apologetics yeah yeah no it is apologetics thank you Martin

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:22.560
thank you hello Democrats he's smocking you the jokes on you it's it's not a story about

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:30.840
a targeted AI voting systems combined with smartphones resulting in a half literate president

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:39.880
that's not what this is about he's smocking you it's all a code I like that I like it when

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.840
people are like I genuinely non-ironically like it when people are like so into something

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:49.160
that they're like was that person being ironic or being no well I mean they're apologetics

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:55.480
but they're lying they're to themselves into they weren't doing a bit they were being sincere

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:59.040
in their own they'll say that they were doing a bit in their memoirs for years from now

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:03.040
I'm sure some of you love Phantom Menace right I'm not even joking I'm sure some of you found

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.080
away Star Wars matters enough to you right right right that you're like no you need to

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:11.280
see it a few times like I didn't like the last Jedi and most people that did were like you

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:18.320
need to see it twice and I was like I'm not that all in it's like like I'm a one you

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:28.600
get one try mr. Lucas I got I got fired from community at season four and then I the last

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:36.040
time I ever googled myself was like I can't wait to see how these people like they are

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:41.800
gonna miss me and I like googled my name like Dan Harmon season four community and it was

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:48.680
like community just got better essentially but it was worse than that actually because

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.560
that would be such an inversion that I would be like oh I'm Jonathan Swift and you're all

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:58.200
the laputians it was like not that satisfying it was more relativistic it was like welcome

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:03.240
to the fact that everything you ever held valuable was a lie because it was like oh I'm

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:08.040
fishing for this Marlin and what you catch isn't the opposite of a Marlin what you catch

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:13.160
is a Marlin boot like you catch it was just like people going like hey let's give it a

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:20.880
chance at least that fucking piece of shit is gone and maybe maybe this season sucks

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:27.960
but doesn't all TV suck and was season three even that good and I was like it was the truth

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:37.480
that I didn't want it burnt like like that burns it hurts holy water shouldn't be burning

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:44.840
you know it shouldn't be burning you that's a bad sign just water you I mean you're that's

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:52.320
your privilege you can call it just regular water but it burns me it's a microaggression

01:25:52.320 --> 01:26:01.520
for you to call it a non devil privilege check your non devil privilege man what what what

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:09.160
hurts you like like like here's our new segment in Harmon Chowkow what hurts Pete Holm are

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:14.000
you are you happy Pete Holms are you coping with happiness or are you are you living

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:22.360
in terror of shut your fucking phone off are you living in terror of like are you are you

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:31.160
addicted to worrying are you just happy I go through peaks and valleys just like everybody

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:36.640
I would say I'm content that I can find I I'm happy to report that I can find a way

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:42.880
I found a way that even when I am depressed there's a part of me that can sort of embrace

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:49.240
the snowed in cozy quality of a sad period if that makes sense can we try like a simulation

that sorry can I cut this this is Toby Tom nom just died in the car crash oh we liked

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:37.520
him Tom nom okay well Pete sounds like Tom nom died no no I can't even remember what I

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:46.520
was there was a thing there was a thing behind my bit that was like I want I wanted to actually

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:55.600
like I wanted to Tom is dead you guys I can't remember what my actual thing well him dying

01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:01.800
makes me sad yet there's a part of me that is appreciating just what it's like to sometimes

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:07.520
be sad yeah oh well no I think it was just like a certain like I know this is exaggeration

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:16.480
but if I like listen Pete HPO we fell back into the bit yeah like I well I remember what

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:26.200
my point was Tom's num Tom num's body is still warm you guys Pete we love Pete are you there

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:37.480
Pete it's me Marsha I own everything Pete are you there I'm breaking up but but but

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:43.480
my question is like what if they is there's something because we're talking about happiness

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:48.800
I'm saying could anything rattle you could anything make you upset oh yeah I get rattled

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:56.960
for sure well then what then what do you do um I mean it sounds glib but I really do try

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:02.560
to enjoy everything sometimes I'll say to Valerie like I'm just being angry for fun like oh

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:07.960
like I want to let her know that I haven't like lost control or something but it's fun

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:14.040
to like rant or talk about he didn't get what you wanted or how sad you are how hurt you

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:18.960
are what somebody owed you you know all this like fucking drama playing a character yeah

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:23.600
it is and it sounds a little glib but I do try to look at it like a character I'm like

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:29.560
look at fucking Pete doing his Pete thing I wonder if Pete will ever get out of this

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:34.040
Joseph Campbell talks about that he talks about like the idea of having one foot in

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:39.000
and one foot out well that's that's a it is a very spiritual idea meaning it shows up

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.960
in all of the myths like you're a rodeo clown you're like like oh look at me like I think

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:47.960
everybody you know some of this is in addressed in my special dirty clean which airs this

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:55.720
Saturday but I thank you I do think we all relate to the idea of like kind of being

01:31:55.720 --> 01:32:01.800
behind our eyeballs like being consciousness and we know that but then this consciousness

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:07.000
is sort of stuck in this in these molecules stuck in the shape of a human body and everybody's

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:14.960
always looking at you and going like hey there's a man and you go like oh man and and you sort

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:18.120
of like you know this is an Alan Watts line he's like you're behind your eyeballs and

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:24.040
the rest just dangles sort of dangles down here and like this is a Pete Holmes line

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:29.880
and you go like I want that Diet Coke send the arm and you like send give it to us and

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:38.120
you drink it so you are it's not really that woo woo or or strange to say you are consciousness

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:43.280
I don't think that is a deeply religious do you ever do you ever have these moods they

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:48.720
never last more than 30 seconds but do you ever be honestly like you're walking around

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:59.400
you go like what if what if I was God what if what if let me finish what if everyone

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:04.600
else was also God yeah you know like and then do you ever like very long are you able to

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:09.400
like keep that crunch going where you like the UPS guy and you're like hello and you're

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:17.000
like like wink wink I get it we're both God that damn that's enlightenment I do you ever

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.880
maintain that for more than 15 seconds because UPS guy is bringing some piece of shit and

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:26.040
you're like this isn't what I ordered no I do it in bursts I want a guy on the 10 today

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:31.240
cut me off and he did it in such a dick way and you're like a blue Honda right but that's

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:34.920
what I did I was what else would God drive yeah he's driving his blue Honda and his windows

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:39.560
are down and he really almost hit me as he as he and it was unnecessary and he's got

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.880
in front of me and I didn't honk because I'm like I'm trying to build a narrative what

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:48.520
am I what one of my favorite quotes is hate is a lack of imagination so I want to hate

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:53.120
this guy I love that's a lack of that was it it's actually I think it's like a proverb

01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:57.160
from a people it's not like a person that's fucking amazing give it a google is a lack

01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:02.840
of imagination isn't that beautiful you haven't bothered to think yet about how to not be pissed

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:06.440
off I would I've added to it I think hell is a lack of imagination that's fantastic

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:10.320
that's also that's my little addition to it so this guy so I'm trying really hard to

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:15.240
go that you're that's gone imaginative he's just playing his part free wills and illusion

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:20.240
we're all just operating in the system of synapses and we're just it's just there the

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:25.200
whole all of this is one thing thinking itself and there's that thing there's that part and

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:30.000
now I'm interacting with it and how I react is is my choice or the illusion of my choice

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:38.040
it's up to you so I didn't react but then someone did exactly to him what he just did

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:43.680
to me like cut him off in the exact same way to him or you to him so someone's cutting

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:50.240
off blue car God and Pete God is watching blue car God and that person I'm actually

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.840
watching and they're not doing it super aggressively they seem to be doing it more out of need

01:34:53.840 --> 01:35:00.960
blue car God honks actually speeds up trying to make a collision it looks like and then

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:05.280
get changes lanes with his windows down and is honking at the person trying to get their

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:10.720
attention to yell at them like fuck you fuck you fuck you and and now I'm trying to box

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:18.880
him in because I don't like blue car God anymore that's all outrage we're like I just was a

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:23.680
good person you're a shitty person the grace that I showed him he didn't have for someone

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:31.360
who just did what he did right but I mean what are we gonna do some gods are assholes

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:38.480
well that's why like like the actual like Zen spot you have to not only it's not about like

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:44.400
it's not about stacking sandbags those will be overcome by the flood you have to actually arrive

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:50.640
at a version of this that is proofed against infinity I actually think it's simpler than that

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:57.760
the brain wants a click moment late like Lego pieces of rationale my ego wants a story that goes

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:04.320
well he's probably late to something and therefore it's justifiable in this like 2018 American

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:09.840
driving etiquette but you have to empathize then no no no you don't have to do any of that in fact

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:15.520
the answer is way beyond your reason and it's beyond your it's trans accept you're like it's

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:19.840
not my job it's not even to think even that's a thought it's trans rational which is one of

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:26.320
my favorite words in the world it doesn't gross it's not rational at all it doesn't require any

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:29.520
effort one of the reasons why people aren't more loving is because it takes all this effort

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:35.520
you have to like be loving but you can actually opt out of the whole game and just go like it

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:42.080
doesn't matter yeah my favorite you talked about Zen my favorite Zen thing is what in this moment

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:47.200
is lacking yeah so I'm telling myself this story about what's fair and what's unfair and who's an

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:51.840
asshole and how he should have learned by how I was nice to him he should be nice to somebody else

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:56.800
when really all of that's over it's just become a story that my brain is telling me that's causing

01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:03.440
me suffering what if I can just do nothing not think but surrender and just go and yet here

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:09.280
we are nothing's wrong in this moment nothing's wrong your brain is just telling you stories

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:14.480
that create your suffering what do you think it is about us that makes us then because that seems

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:22.720
so perfectly logical and it would make us all live longer right why are we we're addicted to it

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:29.120
why are it's pleasant because the individual primate well I think it's more dopamine from alarm

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.400
in the immediate sense right all right I don't I that's an interesting idea is that you get

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:40.080
rewarded as a monkey for going well it's the huh there's something wrong it's the highs and lows

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:46.640
the the this is rom does he talks about the dark night of the soul is really when you realize

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.600
that you're going to lose the highs and the lows of being a part of the human drama yeah

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:58.480
yeah my there my therapist told me she said she said so you may I'm like look I I had a major

01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:03.840
corporation accused me of pedophilia they investigated me I I'm like I'm done like I've

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:08.160
gone through all of these things I quit my twitter account but I've got for the last year I've gone

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:13.920
through all these things and I arrived the story with her and she goes so you're happy now and I go

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:22.560
yeah and she's like what what sorry what's that sound and she's like you're gonna walk around for

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:29.120
the next five years and she characterized it as this thing that I keep thinking of she goes

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:36.880
when you get up from a bar and you're you're like where's my phone where are my keys that that's

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:43.120
your relationship with comfort and happiness that the human the human animal as a primate who

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:49.440
survived this long all of our all of our DNA the reason we're here no matter how chill we are

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:57.360
we owe our fucking lives to the amoeba that was panicky that was like we should change

01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:04.160
you're fucking a right good enough yet brother no you're absolutely and the and dead men tell no

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:13.920
tales so every fucking chill squirrel yeah gone gone done and every fucking like thing that led to us

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:21.360
it was like like especially us like and youth is like yeah climb a branch cling tight scream at

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:27.520
the top of your lungs right there is a leopard coming right and if you scream it loud enough at

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:34.880
the right time you will get laid yeah like and if you and if you're wrong if you can convince

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:41.760
someone a leopard was coming you'll still get laid like that that we invented like no you're

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:48.320
anxiety and alarm because because of a beautiful thing about our species a beautiful thing which

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:55.520
is we don't want no fucking trouble yeah we don't like that is but the one that could imagine trouble

01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:00.480
and then prepare for it the problem is is my therapist always says you know it's a bell curve

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:06.960
you want to have just enough he's like paranoid people are right that that's what he says he's

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:10.880
like you're absolutely right to be paranoid you and this this is his language I hope you're not

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:15.200
offended by it he goes you just don't want to be its bitch that's what he says that's the difference

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:19.440
he's like all of those things that you're worried about could happen that one of the things about

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:26.800
being human is is learning how to like reconcile with that reality and live concurrently you know

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:32.320
the tough thing is though it was like like like so we we wake up every morning we turn on our phones

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:38.480
we have this app and the app says here's everything that happened to every fucking human being across

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:45.600
the planet yes includes everybody so so this is how many 19 year old black men got shot by police

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:50.080
and they didn't deserve it and all these things happen so you get this fire hose to the face

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:59.040
yep and and so the toughest thing of all is you go what you go wait so I'm supposed to do what

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:06.480
and I'm supposed like like and and you get bifurcated at every instance like your your your ego

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:14.720
which should come out of bed fully baked like rising like a beautiful souffle I don't know

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:19.680
anything about cooking this metaphor is bad the souffles aren't for breakfast and that's not

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.480
how it works you're just saying you should be you should have this kind of like whole thing and

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:29.840
then and it's like you wake up in the morning and you pull out your phone and your phone is so

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:34.800
and I'm not saying it's a bad thing because we don't want to your phone is now giving you this

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:42.240
information that that you didn't get when you were a fucking regular ass primate yeah which is like

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:50.960
like somewhere right now someone is they just found their children's bones under a doghouse and the

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:58.080
and the justice department says they should go fuck themselves you you have no like Prince

01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:06.080
Guatemala like like like had to leave his palace like like and go who's what's with that guy over

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:12.240
there and then the people are like he's got the flu and he's like well then I'm gonna be a religion

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:17.280
like like well get great like I guess hip hop was easier back then too like but

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:27.920
like every 13 year old now that can read the first thing they read is is is actual misery is

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.800
happening I don't know what I don't you know so Pete home so what are you gonna do in season four

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:38.320
of crashing but it's it's you know your feed might be misery but the truth is is we could also just

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:42.960
be reading entertainment news we could just be doing Sudoku we could just be reading fiction it

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:49.200
doesn't have to be I'm just saying no no I think what's going on is no we're drawn to it I don't

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:54.000
and I don't mean to imply it's being forced upon us I yeah no I didn't think you were but misery is

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.440
one of the avenues that you can choose and and maybe you know I it's good to know what's going

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.720
on the world for sure I think what's been perverted is our our we're addicted to thinking we love

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.520
thinking and we think thinking about things is important and you're absolutely I think the brain

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:15.840
is taken over our being the human brain is a terminal like you the servants become the master

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.400
you get to choose like like basically we're all and it's an addiction and it feels good knowing

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:24.960
everything and no no no we're all choosing an individual level something that actually we

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:30.640
should be proud of right we should forgive ourselves for which is that if if you if you pump all

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:38.160
information about human misery and pleasure into our brain we will over the shoes to focus on the

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:44.560
misery yeah and we will choose to figure out how to react to it the best way we can as children

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:50.320
which is we will swing our toy fire truck at it we'll be like then fuck you that's right I hate

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:55.920
badness and I want goodness I don't want lucky charms I want golden grams right like we we don't

01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:01.680
know what else to do we're children as a species what a what a species should be expected to deal

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:08.240
with all that information I agree I actually I would argue that it is certainly partly a bad thing

01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.880
you know it's hard to talk about because I can't represent everybody in the room and I know a lot

01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:20.960
of people would say that you need to know what's going on I tend to opt out of as much of it as I

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:28.160
can all I know is that opting out has led toward my happiness but I'm not so naive as to think

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:34.800
that that means that everybody should opt out that's all I know right now is a 45 year old man that I

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:42.320
I was making myself and other people miserable yeah and that I deleted my Twitter and my Facebook

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:48.560
and that I got happier but I I absolutely keep in mind the fact that this is not that that's not

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:53.600
the third act of a story about being being happy right it might be the first act of a story about

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:58.400
taking responsibility I don't know I but the point I'm trying to make because we all have

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:03.360
social responsibility and we do want to know about young black men being shot which was everybody

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:08.000
come on we all want to know about it well we need to know to keep people accountable it's the new

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:19.840
marmaduke hi Pete Holmes do not endorse that joke but what I'm trying to say is take the misery

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:25.600
addiction out which it can be you're gonna replace most people are gonna replace it with something else

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.960
and what I'm arguing for which brings me a lot of contentment not necessarily happiness but a lot

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:37.040
of contentment a lot of equanimity is practicing being and we're getting robbed of that whether it

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:42.880
is from just doing crosswords or reading entertainment news and not any of the serious stuff or any

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:48.640
fucking bullshit or watching mindless endless television this is just feeding your ego feeding

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:52.800
you with anxiety and stress because I think we have an ego addiction as well we want to know who

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.280
we are so we can know oh I disagree with you this is why racism is so popular this is why

01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:01.760
transphobia is so popular it's my misogyny so popular because we're feeding you're gonna you're

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:07.920
gonna a faster path to find out who you are but not but not if there's articles that say like hey

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:12.560
this transgender bathroom fucking thing happened you're gonna click that faster than it's like

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.760
here's everything you've ever not wanted to know about blue whales like there's like all this

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:22.320
information that's what I'm saying you're gonna rush your ego gets a rush going you're like I want

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:27.360
to know who I am I want to know who I am it's it's it's tribalism it's it's a lot it gives a good

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:33.200
feeling of identity even the rage you go well that's fucking bullshit your ego goes here I am

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:38.240
but when I said earlier it seems like we're so far away from it what in this moment is lacking

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:46.000
and I felt like we shared a nice moment of like here we are that's what's missing from equanimity

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:51.040
peace and contentment and joy and bliss and it has very little to do with my fucking phone which I

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:58.400
don't turn on until after breakfast like well done like I'm like like I'm having these crazy dreams

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:03.760
lately because I'm spending way more time on my screen than I ever have and it's fucking me up

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.960
like during the night and having like terrible like weird dreams but like going on stage and doing

01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:13.280
comedy yeah you know what I call looking at Instagram before I go to bed casting my dream

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:20.320
exactly it's fucking bullshit do you realize how every primitive culture what a value they put

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:24.720
on your dreams and what a glimpse into your subconscious and meaning they were and now I'm

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:33.280
dreaming about fucking an episode of 24 we can you imagine our humanity you had like like yeah

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:38.400
they'd be like I was thinking about that today you gave one like primitive person a phone of

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:43.440
course they'd look at it it's not your friend I'm sorry I took over no that's you that's where it's

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:47.120
not your friend it's where I was going while you're here but like like people like ask me like

01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:50.400
do you get nervous when you walk on stage I'm like that's the least nervous I ever am because

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:55.360
that's the most present I am that's right I'm walking look at us none of us are looking at her

01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:01.040
phones it's fucking great yeah like it's like like being in a room full of people and like getting

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:07.440
the the call and response of talking and laughter or the silence of thoughts and stuff like that like

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.960
that's that's the most pure thing of my day and then you walk off stage and you're like oh

01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.360
that's right what are they saying about it and who fucking cares who gives a stupid dude we've

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:22.160
figured out we've all sort of woke up about food at least a lot of us have that a lot of food is

01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:26.000
made by corporations that don't care about you that just want to make you addicted to food that

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.040
seemed to like be something right around supersize me we're like oh they just want to make you want

01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:35.520
more of it so you just buy more of it it's just capitalism right we're starting to figure out

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:40.960
the same thing about your phone that the colors on your phone trigger things in your brain that

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:46.080
make you like seriously addicted to it because those were colors that were important to your

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:53.280
survival red doesn't belong in that way in fucking snapchat it's making something happen in your brain

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:58.960
that was designed to keep you alive and it's the manipulation of that in the same way that msg is

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.440
addictive or sugar is addicted these colors and but there's a part of it like everything that

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:08.800
tastes good though there's a part of it that works really well I mean the advent of smartphones

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:14.800
and everyone being connected the dropping of shame veils the idea that you could be in Iowa and

01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:20.640
talk to somebody someone in Wyoming means that like trans people gay people yeah that's right but

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:28.640
that that that you you nerds like like who can propel marvel empires to empire status like

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:35.360
everyone it can suddenly just go like hey fuck fuck with the 150 jackoffs at my accounting

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:42.640
company think I I live in the real world which is on my phone which is the more real than I

01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:48.160
understand hall which says that actually I think Robert Downey Jr. is a great choice for Tony Stark

01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:53.360
and I fucking sign off on that and I upvote it and you feel vindicated it's Billy Elliot in your

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.800
pocket and then it has this horrible like downside which is like also across town in a basement all

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:07.200
the Nazis going like hey oh shit I'm not the only 38 year old virgin uh fuck Jews swipe right like

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:14.080
hating Jews oh I love I love hating Jews too and everyone the shame barrier drops and you got a

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:21.840
bunch of human brains going like I'm not ashamed I love my voice I'm talking now right but but I

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.720
I feel I would argue you can do all of that with your phone on grayscale though oh yes yes

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:32.400
yes no I know that which is an option it's very easy to do it's under accessibility and you can

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:36.880
make it a triple click shortcut if you want to use your map or something that you think requires

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:42.080
color my phone's on I have a lot of p-tips to get off your phone I've and color is a huge one it

01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:48.320
does drain your battery a little bit go to p-tips do you go to p-tips.net full color page explaining

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:54.400
I'm nothing but a supporter of p-tips but I also look at myself at 45 I feel like the reason I'm

01:50:54.400 --> 01:51:03.040
into p-tips uh is not because I'm a I'm enlightened it's because I actually like I feel beaten and

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:10.160
like I'm like I feel like the onion knight in game of thrones like I'm like I he cut my fingers off

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:17.040
I'm cool like like like that and so I want I feel pity for the average 19 year old out there it's

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:23.520
like now these old enlightened people telling me turn on grayscale yeah do that later do I did that

01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:29.600
when I was 38 okay you know what I mean great but I got it but you got to be somebody before you

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:36.240
can be nobody but the yeah that's that's by being somebody we mean being part of the board cube

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:45.040
that's the yeah exactly yeah like I'm not gonna raise my daughter to be fuck that be like me from

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:48.640
the beginning when are you gonna when are you gonna when are you gonna I was in my basement

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:55.680
playing fucking Sega CD 12 hours a day that's all part of it it's not a flaw leaving the village

01:51:55.680 --> 01:52:00.160
to come back to the village isn't a flaw that's what makes that's what gives life a pulse you

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:04.400

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:10.560
