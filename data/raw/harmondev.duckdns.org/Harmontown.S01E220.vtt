{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:37.600\nLadies and gentlemen of whatever borough this is, welcome to Harmontown, which is now\n\n11:37.600 --> 11:48.000\nin session.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:58.000\nPlease welcome Spencer Crittenden to the stage.\n\n11:58.000 --> 11:59.000\nWhat up?\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:00.800\nOh, fuck.\n\n12:00.800 --> 12:07.240\nYou know, that's such a good applause, I'm only gonna betray that confidence in me.\n\n12:07.240 --> 12:10.840\nSee that exact, that laugh is exactly what I'm talking about, get ready for that the\n\n12:10.840 --> 12:11.840\nwhole night.\n\n12:11.840 --> 12:31.960\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n12:31.960 --> 12:32.960\nThank you New York.\n\n12:32.960 --> 12:35.080\nI love you so much the second time.\n\n12:35.080 --> 12:38.400\nThe first show was kind of a trial run.\n\n12:38.400 --> 12:45.720\nIf you were at that show, and you're also at this one, it's just twice as expensive\n\n12:45.720 --> 12:48.720\nfor like the real show.\n\n12:48.720 --> 12:54.400\nIf you were at that show and you're not at this one, like, I'm not saying anything that\n\n12:54.400 --> 12:56.760\nmakes us legally accountable to you.\n\n12:56.760 --> 12:58.920\nYou can't get a refund.\n\n12:58.920 --> 13:05.800\nI'm saying legally it was a good show last night, like I'm leaving a paper trail that\n\n13:05.800 --> 13:16.480\nI considered that a good show worth $25 plus a $10 seating fee, but I'm saying to you people,\n\n13:16.480 --> 13:18.680\nyou're in for a much better show.\n\n13:18.680 --> 13:20.800\nOh, big time.\n\n13:20.800 --> 13:23.480\nWe got guests.\n\n13:23.480 --> 13:25.000\nDonald Trump is here everybody.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:29.440\nDonald Trump is here.\n\n13:29.440 --> 13:30.440\nWe're also tired.\n\n13:30.440 --> 13:31.440\nWe're also raw.\n\n13:31.440 --> 13:32.680\nWe're also sad.\n\n13:32.680 --> 13:39.760\nI speak, one of the silver linings of the things that I talked about already is like\n\n13:39.760 --> 13:40.760\nthe world.\n\n13:40.760 --> 13:46.760\nWe're also fucking scared that actually normal Republicans are talking to like Democrats\n\n13:46.760 --> 13:53.160\nand stuff and saying like, look, all I ever wanted was to make money.\n\n13:53.160 --> 13:58.360\nThere's some honesty getting squeezed out of this zit of an election.\n\n13:58.360 --> 14:03.800\nAnd I don't know what to tell you kids because I guess actually we're talking to people.\n\n14:03.800 --> 14:08.840\nMost of the people that we're talking to will already have voted or not voted and the election\n\n14:08.840 --> 14:09.840\nis over.\n\n14:09.840 --> 14:10.840\nRight, especially once it's dropped.\n\n14:10.840 --> 14:12.440\nBecause the podcast is on Wednesday.\n\n14:12.440 --> 14:16.560\nSo I'm only talking to a room full of people before the election.\n\n14:16.560 --> 14:22.840\nEveryone else is like, whatever you're talking about doesn't matter anymore.\n\n14:22.840 --> 14:25.920\nAnd we're only 300 people, so we don't matter.\n\n14:25.920 --> 14:31.120\nAnd we're in a certain state, in a certain jurisdiction, and nothing matters.\n\n14:31.120 --> 14:36.280\nLike, kids.\n\n14:36.280 --> 14:44.520\nI would say if you live in a swing state, I'm not talking to anyone in a swing state.\n\n14:44.520 --> 14:45.520\nIt's too late for me to tell anything.\n\n14:45.520 --> 14:50.600\nIf you live in a swing state, either good job or what the fuck.\n\n14:50.600 --> 14:54.080\nYeah, it's all over already.\n\n14:54.080 --> 14:56.680\nWe're actually living in a time bubble.\n\n14:56.680 --> 15:00.280\nWe're living in the future because nothing we do matters.\n\n15:00.280 --> 15:03.520\nNothing we do will change the election, which hasn't happened yet.\n\n15:03.520 --> 15:07.640\nBut as far as we're concerned, it already happened.\n\n15:07.640 --> 15:08.640\nThat's kind of weird.\n\n15:08.640 --> 15:09.640\nWe live in the future right now.\n\n15:09.640 --> 15:15.320\nSo let's open the imaginary door in one of two scenarios.\n\n15:15.320 --> 15:24.280\nIn one scenario, in a predictable election, we now have the first woman president and\n\n15:24.280 --> 15:28.240\nit's a Democrat.\n\n15:28.240 --> 15:36.360\nAnd we've therefore aggravated a frothy, frothy, like, white nationalist population\n\n15:36.360 --> 15:43.920\nwho are not, that's their dream result, they're going to function a lot better if there's\n\n15:43.920 --> 15:50.640\na race-trader lady in the White House and their only job is complaining.\n\n15:50.640 --> 15:54.440\nThat's going to be their gas rent.\n\n15:54.440 --> 15:55.440\nThey love that.\n\n15:55.440 --> 15:58.960\nThey're not dreaming of Capitol Hill.\n\n15:58.960 --> 16:01.960\nThey're not dreaming of that.\n\n16:01.960 --> 16:07.160\nIf you're right now a white nationalist, you're probably, I don't know how to chart your weekly\n\n16:07.160 --> 16:10.880\nincome, but it's got to be spiking right now.\n\n16:10.880 --> 16:17.560\nIn the form of combat boot fees, I don't know how they make their money, but you know they're\n\n16:17.560 --> 16:21.120\nmaking three times as much right now as they ever have.\n\n16:21.120 --> 16:29.440\nAnd that would end if you did elect Hitler, because then he'd be like, so I love being\n\n16:29.440 --> 16:33.600\npresident and then they'd be like, what's up with that Hitler stuff, come on, let's\n\n16:33.600 --> 16:34.600\ndo that Hitler stuff.\n\n16:34.600 --> 16:36.600\nHe'd be like, I can't do it.\n\n16:36.600 --> 16:38.080\nIt's going to be huge when I do it.\n\n16:38.080 --> 16:40.240\nAnd they're going to be like, this guy's a bad Hitler.\n\n16:40.240 --> 16:42.800\nHe's bad at being Hitler.\n\n16:42.800 --> 16:45.040\nAnd he's going to be like, yeah, I'm bad at everything.\n\n16:45.040 --> 16:47.600\nThat's always been the fucking bit, you mooks.\n\n16:47.600 --> 16:51.200\nI'm the fucking son of a slumlord.\n\n16:51.200 --> 16:54.480\nIt's hilarious that I'm standing here and you can't change that.\n\n16:54.480 --> 16:56.320\nI fucking win.\n\n16:56.320 --> 16:57.640\nI win when I lose.\n\n16:57.640 --> 16:59.240\nI win when I win.\n\n16:59.240 --> 17:00.240\nI have hair.\n\n17:00.240 --> 17:02.920\nI don't have hair.\n\n17:02.920 --> 17:06.200\nI'm white, but I'm orange.\n\n17:06.200 --> 17:12.560\nI fucking like, we're going to remember him as a hero 40 years from now when we're like\n\n17:12.560 --> 17:20.760\nrowing space boats away from a planet that just burnt to a cinder whether anyone was\n\n17:20.760 --> 17:22.640\npresident or not.\n\n17:22.640 --> 17:28.200\nJust fucking burnt up because of a fucking like fireball from the sun or something.\n\n17:28.200 --> 17:30.480\nOh fuck.\n\n17:30.480 --> 17:31.480\nCan that happen?\n\n17:31.480 --> 17:32.760\nDoes the sun shoot fireballs?\n\n17:32.760 --> 17:33.760\nI'm asking you.\n\n17:33.760 --> 17:34.760\nOh yeah.\n\n17:34.760 --> 17:35.760\nThat can happen.\n\n17:35.760 --> 17:36.760\nThat can happen.\n\n17:36.760 --> 17:37.760\nFireballs.\n\n17:37.760 --> 17:41.760\nIt's called a solar flare ball.\n\n17:41.760 --> 17:42.760\nEvent.\n\n17:42.760 --> 17:43.760\nWait.\n\n17:43.760 --> 17:44.760\nWell.\n\n17:44.760 --> 17:45.760\nYou.\n\n17:45.760 --> 17:46.760\nSorry.\n\n17:46.760 --> 17:56.320\nSpencer has been hanging out more than he has hung out.\n\n17:56.320 --> 18:02.840\nAnd you had a conversation at some point in a van or something.\n\n18:02.840 --> 18:05.000\nIt was in a white van.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:06.000\nIt wasn't.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:07.000\nYou said.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:08.960\nYou're on the way to an undisclosed location.\n\n18:08.960 --> 18:11.360\nThere's a phrase, sexual innuendo.\n\n18:11.360 --> 18:12.360\nYes.\n\n18:12.360 --> 18:16.400\nAre you a little for the folks at home?\n\n18:16.400 --> 18:19.360\nWhat is sexual innuendo?\n\n18:19.360 --> 18:26.360\nSexual innuendo is when you're not saying penis, but you mean penis.\n\n18:26.360 --> 18:29.040\nLike I'd like to handle that gear shift or something.\n\n18:29.040 --> 18:30.040\nRight.\n\n18:30.040 --> 18:31.040\nSee if I say like, I'm going to.\n\n18:31.040 --> 18:32.040\nI'm sorry.\n\n18:32.040 --> 18:36.040\nI'm going to wax the flagpole if you know what I mean.\n\n18:36.040 --> 18:37.040\nRight.\n\n18:37.040 --> 18:38.320\nAnd then the person says, I do know what you mean.\n\n18:38.320 --> 18:40.040\nYou mean you're going to go stroke your.\n\n18:40.040 --> 18:41.040\nJerk it.\n\n18:41.040 --> 18:43.960\nAnd that was innuendo.\n\n18:43.960 --> 18:49.760\nAnd then if you say no, that was innuendo.\n\n18:49.760 --> 18:51.360\nThat's meta innuendo.\n\n18:51.360 --> 18:52.360\nAnd you.\n\n18:52.360 --> 18:55.040\nBut it's also a pun, right?\n\n18:55.040 --> 18:56.040\nIt's a.\n\n18:56.040 --> 18:57.040\nIt's mostly a pun.\n\n18:57.040 --> 18:59.040\nIt's fan service is what it is.\n\n18:59.040 --> 19:04.000\nIt'll, it'll, it'll, it'll, it'll not win an Emmy, but it'll keep you, it'll keep\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.040\nyou squeaking by.\n\n19:07.040 --> 19:09.240\nYou'll be, you'll be flesh and signature appointments.\n\n19:09.240 --> 19:12.840\nYou'll be like, oh man, I never mind.\n\n19:12.840 --> 19:13.840\nI can't.\n\n19:13.840 --> 19:14.840\nYeah, I can't talk about that.\n\n19:14.840 --> 19:15.840\nOkay.\n\n19:15.840 --> 19:16.840\nDon't, don't say that.\n\n19:16.840 --> 19:17.840\nDon't say, don't say stuff.\n\n19:17.840 --> 19:18.840\nYou can't talk about that.\n\n19:18.840 --> 19:19.840\nThat's, that's horrible.\n\n19:19.840 --> 19:24.360\nThat's like crazy to say to people innuendo.\n\n19:24.360 --> 19:25.360\nAlways sexual.\n\n19:25.360 --> 19:26.360\nAll right.\n\n19:26.360 --> 19:27.360\nTo in today's world.\n\n19:27.360 --> 19:29.360\nIt's supposed to be.\n\n19:29.360 --> 19:30.360\nIt is.\n\n19:30.360 --> 19:33.240\nLike we say, we have the phrase sexual innuendo because not all innuendo is sexual.\n\n19:33.240 --> 19:34.240\nRight.\n\n19:34.240 --> 19:37.480\nOnly sexual innuendo is, but, but, but there isn't.\n\n19:37.480 --> 19:43.040\nAnd so Spencer said last night, we need to bring back non-sexual innuendo.\n\n19:43.040 --> 19:44.040\nYeah.\n\n19:44.040 --> 19:45.040\nIt's fun.\n\n19:45.040 --> 19:46.360\nI thought that would be a great goal.\n\n19:46.360 --> 19:47.360\nI don't know.\n\n19:47.360 --> 19:49.480\nI don't, I don't have anything else to do tonight.\n\n19:49.480 --> 19:52.400\nSo I thought we could bring back non-sexual innuendo.\n\n19:52.400 --> 19:53.400\nRight.\n\n19:53.400 --> 20:02.640\nSo like if I were to say, uh, hey, um, tomorrow night I'm gonna, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna\n\n20:02.640 --> 20:05.440\nsharpen a pencil if you know what I mean.\n\n20:05.440 --> 20:06.440\nRight.\n\n20:06.440 --> 20:11.640\nBut you're like, I will, if proper innuendo, I don't think you want to be saying if, if\n\n20:11.640 --> 20:12.640\nyou know what I mean.\n\n20:12.640 --> 20:13.640\nRight.\n\n20:13.640 --> 20:14.640\nOh no.\n\n20:14.640 --> 20:15.640\nOkay.\n\n20:15.640 --> 20:16.840\nBecause innuendo, it's about doublespeak.\n\n20:16.840 --> 20:21.760\nIt's about hiding the true intention of what you're saying so that uninitiative parties\n\n20:21.760 --> 20:24.600\ndon't know that you're talking about what you're talking about and think you're just\n\n20:24.600 --> 20:27.680\ntalking about bread or pigeons or something.\n\n20:27.680 --> 20:31.520\nSo like, I don't know, like here's, this is me complaining about something.\n\n20:31.520 --> 20:32.520\nUm, okay.\n\n20:32.520 --> 20:42.080\nSo I can't stand how burnt my buns are getting with all these bread lines being so, uh, close.\n\n20:42.080 --> 20:43.080\nYou see?\n\n20:43.080 --> 20:46.160\nThat's just me talking about bread to you people.\n\n20:46.160 --> 20:50.160\nYou couldn't possibly imagine I was meaning other things by that sentence because that's\n\n20:50.160 --> 20:54.880\njust normal bread people talk, but I was really complaining about something.\n\n20:54.880 --> 20:57.800\nI know you mean like, let the fourth rake begin.\n\n20:57.800 --> 20:58.800\nRight.\n\n20:58.800 --> 21:02.400\nI know that and you know that, but they don't know that.\n\n21:02.400 --> 21:03.480\nAnd that's why it's great.\n\n21:03.480 --> 21:09.400\nAnd that's why we need to bring it back to hide our white nationalist tendencies.\n\n21:09.400 --> 21:13.280\nSo whatever happens on Tuesday, uh, is it still Tuesday?\n\n21:13.280 --> 21:14.280\nSure.\n\n21:14.280 --> 21:16.320\nI mean, it'll probably go until like Wednesday or something.\n\n21:16.320 --> 21:17.320\nCan we push it?\n\n21:17.320 --> 21:19.720\nUh, the, I just, just remember, okay.\n\n21:19.720 --> 21:26.200\nSo this time around, no matter what happens, like we're all abused children.\n\n21:26.200 --> 21:27.520\nWe live in a home.\n\n21:27.520 --> 21:30.120\nI don't care if you're conservative or whatever.\n\n21:30.120 --> 21:32.200\nLike you all agree with everybody.\n\n21:32.200 --> 21:34.400\nWe have a hundred percent agreement on this.\n\n21:34.400 --> 21:39.760\nThe last year and a half has been an abusive relationship between us and the people that\n\n21:39.760 --> 21:41.400\nwould tell us what to do.\n\n21:41.400 --> 21:45.000\nLike, and we have been, we have felt fed up about it.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:50.280\nWe have been like raked over shit when we have better stuff to do.\n\n21:50.280 --> 21:51.440\nWe're not politicians.\n\n21:51.440 --> 21:55.200\nWe shouldn't have to think about their job this much.\n\n21:55.200 --> 22:00.800\nAnd we like, like, like we are, we're all bummed out and, and, and every, every moment\n\n22:00.800 --> 22:04.080\nthat you would think the solution would be to not care.\n\n22:04.080 --> 22:10.000\nSomeone says the word abortion or women or race or like anything that like triggers you\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:13.480\nand goes like, well, they're talking about important shit.\n\n22:13.480 --> 22:17.080\nI, yeah, they're, they're always going to be, and they, they got to me and they got\n\n22:17.080 --> 22:18.080\nto you.\n\n22:18.080 --> 22:23.080\nAnd we, we're now here on the eve of like, it's, it's something's going to give.\n\n22:23.080 --> 22:26.920\nWe're all going to stop having to fucking think about it for a while.\n\n22:26.920 --> 22:32.640\nLike we have to spend that four years, like whatever these dumbass house of representatives\n\n22:32.640 --> 22:36.880\nare that we're always hearing about, like, oh, they own the, we kind of start getting\n\n22:36.880 --> 22:39.840\nthird party candidates into those seats.\n\n22:39.840 --> 22:45.200\nLike, like, I, I would, that, that's my weird pitch is like, let's just start, let's, let's\n\n22:45.200 --> 22:48.560\nhave the historic election and go, yay, we did it.\n\n22:48.560 --> 22:54.560\nAnd then be like, okay, now the next, like weird election that comes up, if we believe\n\n22:54.560 --> 22:58.800\nin this system, then we'll go like, I don't, if you say that you're a Republican or Democrat,\n\n22:58.800 --> 22:59.800\nthat's a red flag.\n\n22:59.800 --> 23:04.760\nLike, like you're, because you're part of a bad fucking weird, good cop, bad cop, alcoholic\n\n23:04.760 --> 23:10.920\nhusband system, where it's like this syndrome of like black eye and then apology and black\n\n23:10.920 --> 23:11.920\neye and then apology.\n\n23:11.920 --> 23:16.000\nAnd it's like, like, it's not fucking working with given it 60 years, they built this shit\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.080\non top of something.\n\n23:17.080 --> 23:18.080\nIt's made of two legs.\n\n23:18.080 --> 23:20.240\nSo you think it's two things, but it's an animal.\n\n23:20.240 --> 23:21.240\nAll right.\n\n23:21.240 --> 23:22.240\nAll right.\n\n23:22.240 --> 23:23.240\nThat's it.\n\n23:23.240 --> 23:24.740\nThat ends the political segment, because now we don't have to worry about it anymore.\n\n23:24.740 --> 23:28.120\nBecause it's fucking, we, we walk out of here and into a world where it already happened.\n\n23:28.120 --> 23:29.120\nIt's over.\n\n23:29.120 --> 23:33.440\nAnd you're going to find out, like that office is so insignificant, Hitler could be in it\n\n23:33.440 --> 23:35.800\nand nothing would still happen.\n\n23:35.800 --> 23:39.240\nHe'd be like, I want to close Guantanamo or make it twice as big.\n\n23:39.240 --> 23:43.600\nAnd it would just be like Guantanamo still be there and the same size, like four years\n\n23:43.600 --> 23:48.240\nfrom now, Hitler will be like, I, that should be filled with Jews and like a million times\n\n23:48.240 --> 23:49.240\nthe size.\n\n23:49.240 --> 23:51.840\nAnd it will, but it'll be caught up in red tape.\n\n23:51.840 --> 23:58.120\nIt just, we can take comfort in our catch cradle of fucking, we're fine, we'll be fine\n\n23:58.120 --> 24:00.120\nfor a while.\n\n24:00.120 --> 24:06.800\nPompey, last words at Pompey.\n\n24:06.800 --> 24:07.800\nWe got a fine.\n\n24:07.800 --> 24:08.800\nIt's a big mountain.\n\n24:08.800 --> 24:13.880\nThere's some lava dribbling out by the time that becomes an issue, I think we'll have\n\n24:13.880 --> 24:24.960\ntime to wake up and grab the kids and the boom, I'm catching a ball forever again in a museum\n\n24:24.960 --> 24:30.520\nin Milwaukee and a guy like the, like they make the molds and there's like a guy holding\n\n24:30.520 --> 24:31.520\na guy up.\n\n24:31.520 --> 24:32.520\nIs that real?\n\n24:32.520 --> 24:36.160\nWell, you got like the Pompey things and then there's a guy with a knife and then there's\n\n24:36.160 --> 24:38.200\na rich guy going like, here's my money.\n\n24:38.200 --> 24:45.240\nAnd he's like, he's like in the middle of being robbed and civilization, I don't know\n\n24:45.240 --> 24:48.800\nhow to feel about that.\n\n24:48.800 --> 24:50.240\nBut that's got to be fake, right?\n\n24:50.240 --> 24:56.360\nThere's no such thing as an event that happens so fast that you can be mid-robing.\n\n24:56.360 --> 24:58.040\nNothing has ever happened that quickly.\n\n24:58.040 --> 25:01.880\nI bet a nuclear bomb might do that, but it wouldn't leave anything, right?\n\n25:01.880 --> 25:07.400\nYou'd hear a whistle of the bomb coming down and you'd be like this, like like Pompey should\n\n25:07.400 --> 25:14.200\nbe, all of the Pompey molds should be, everybody going like, that's if it happened really fast.\n\n25:14.200 --> 25:19.280\nIt should just be a bunch of people, maybe one guy's holding a knife and then you got\n\n25:19.280 --> 25:21.720\nlike, I bet he was robbing him, that would be fun.\n\n25:21.720 --> 25:27.120\nBut I don't believe that he, the guy's gone, stick him up.\n\n25:27.120 --> 25:28.960\nLike it's like a freeze ray hit him.\n\n25:28.960 --> 25:29.960\nRight.\n\n25:29.960 --> 25:31.280\nI don't know if I believe that.\n\n25:31.280 --> 25:32.280\nYeah.\n\n25:32.280 --> 25:33.280\nI'd like to believe that.\n\n25:33.280 --> 25:34.280\nThat's like a guillotine.\n\n25:34.280 --> 25:36.920\nThey say the guillotine is the most humane way of execution.\n\n25:36.920 --> 25:38.520\nNo one can, no one can test this.\n\n25:38.520 --> 25:43.480\nYou can't, you can't survey severed heads versus people that got lethal injection.\n\n25:43.480 --> 25:47.880\nBut they say the guillotine is the most humane way to kill somebody.\n\n25:47.880 --> 25:53.200\nAccording to my 10th grade history teacher, who, who must be right about everything because\n\n25:53.200 --> 26:01.520\nhe was in Korea during the war and he also would constantly accidentally smoke his chalk.\n\n26:01.520 --> 26:09.400\nSo I believe everything he says and he said, all you feel is a cold, a cold, just a cold\n\n26:09.400 --> 26:11.320\nsensation in the back of your neck.\n\n26:11.320 --> 26:12.320\nHe doesn't know.\n\n26:12.320 --> 26:13.320\nBlissful darkness.\n\n26:13.320 --> 26:14.320\nYeah.\n\n26:14.320 --> 26:18.200\nDid he, did he mention the least humane way to execute somebody?\n\n26:18.200 --> 26:19.200\nNo.\n\n26:19.200 --> 26:20.200\nOh.\n\n26:20.200 --> 26:25.000\nWhat do you think, what, I, I, I, I'd like to challenge you to come up with it.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:26.000\nAll right.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:27.000\nOkay.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nOkay.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:29.000\nUm.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:30.000\nThe least humane way.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:31.000\nAll right.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:32.000\nSo.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:33.000\nDefinitely just.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:36.360\nYou get a bunch of fire ants and then you give them knives.\n\n26:36.360 --> 26:38.200\nChinese fire ant sized knives.\n\n26:38.200 --> 26:39.520\nYeah.\n\n26:39.520 --> 26:43.040\nJust let nature take its course.\n\n26:43.040 --> 26:47.280\nI say humiliate them to death.\n\n26:47.280 --> 26:55.480\nKeep them fed and watered and immortal and like make them have to die of shame.\n\n26:55.480 --> 26:56.480\nOkay.\n\n26:56.480 --> 27:02.480\nWell, that's, that's very conceptual, but what does that, what does that look like?\n\n27:02.480 --> 27:03.480\nWhat does it look like?\n\n27:03.480 --> 27:04.480\nYeah.\n\n27:04.480 --> 27:05.480\nWell, how do you humiliate it?\n\n27:05.480 --> 27:09.720\nIt looks like a standard harness in a, in a windowless room with tubes going into them\n\n27:09.720 --> 27:12.760\nthat give them nutrients and liquid.\n\n27:12.760 --> 27:13.760\nAnd then.\n\n27:13.760 --> 27:14.760\nHumiliation is happening.\n\n27:14.760 --> 27:15.760\nNo.\n\n27:15.760 --> 27:16.760\nWhat's the humility?\n\n27:16.760 --> 27:17.760\nLike is it people laughing?\n\n27:17.760 --> 27:19.760\nIs he like getting his dick slapped or something?\n\n27:19.760 --> 27:25.360\nLike no one wants to be seen with their dick being slapped in public, right?\n\n27:25.360 --> 27:29.600\nYou come into the room and you say, uh, hi, how are you?\n\n27:29.600 --> 27:33.200\nAnd then you leave and then you do that 40 times.\n\n27:33.200 --> 27:34.200\nRight.\n\n27:34.200 --> 27:38.160\nAnd then the third, the 41st time you say, hi, how are you?\n\n27:38.160 --> 27:41.920\nBut you said I was going to leave anyways.\n\n27:41.920 --> 27:47.880\nThat's just one example of how you'll never know what the fuck is going on.\n\n27:47.880 --> 27:53.400\nI'm going to tell you some shit, not because you'll, you ever have the right to know and\n\n27:53.400 --> 27:58.320\nnot because it profits me, but because it will make your torture more exquisite.\n\n27:58.320 --> 28:03.000\nI'm telling you, you're part of an experiment where we're seeing if we can humiliate a person\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nto death.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:05.720\nThat's how significant you are.\n\n28:05.720 --> 28:10.320\nYou're interesting, but you don't matter.\n\n28:10.320 --> 28:14.800\nIf we don't humiliate you to death, I guess he'll die of gangrene or anything else that\n\n28:14.800 --> 28:16.720\nwould kill you.\n\n28:16.720 --> 28:21.080\nBut if we humiliate you to death, it will be no different.\n\n28:21.080 --> 28:22.080\nIt won't matter.\n\n28:22.080 --> 28:23.080\nIt won't matter.\n\n28:23.080 --> 28:24.080\nYou don't matter.\n\n28:24.080 --> 28:28.080\nAnd then I'd leave and then I'd keep coming back and I just like some days I'd come back\n\n28:28.080 --> 28:35.160\nwith a soda, like a Diet Coke and I'd just, and then I'd leave.\n\n28:35.160 --> 28:43.360\nWhat does humiliation mean to you?\n\n28:43.360 --> 28:45.360\nTo cause humility.\n\n28:45.360 --> 28:46.360\nRight.\n\n28:46.360 --> 28:49.720\nAnd humility is when two people are talking to each other.\n\n28:49.720 --> 28:56.760\nNo, humility is when one person being talked to feels like they don't mean very much.\n\n28:56.760 --> 28:57.760\nRight.\n\n28:57.760 --> 29:00.680\nBut they mean enough that someone's spending their entire life.\n\n29:00.680 --> 29:02.760\nI would nip that in the bud.\n\n29:02.760 --> 29:04.880\nI would say to the guy, by the way, we're\n\n29:04.880 --> 29:07.400\nprobably doing this to 700 people.\n\n29:07.400 --> 29:09.240\nWell, you'd have to get different people.\n\n29:09.240 --> 29:12.680\nIt couldn't be you because you'd be like, man, you need to get a life, man.\n\n29:12.680 --> 29:16.120\nNo, but I would nip what you're talking about in the bud because you're getting to a thing.\n\n29:16.120 --> 29:19.040\nThat's what all the Twitter people go when they go, Dan, you're fat and you're untalented\n\n29:19.040 --> 29:20.040\nand who cares.\n\n29:20.040 --> 29:21.040\nOf course.\n\n29:21.040 --> 29:22.040\nAnd then I go, fuck you.\n\n29:22.040 --> 29:23.040\nAnd then they go, fuck me, fuck you.\n\n29:23.040 --> 29:26.480\nAnd I go, fuck you, kid, fuck you.\n\n29:26.480 --> 29:28.480\nAnd then the kid's like, fuck you, fuck you.\n\n29:28.480 --> 29:30.880\nNice to see you're fat and chubby chasing.\n\n29:30.880 --> 29:31.880\nFat, fat.\n\n29:31.880 --> 29:37.520\nAnd I'm like, hey, kid, listen to me, fuck you.\n\n29:37.520 --> 29:39.320\nNothing's changing.\n\n29:39.320 --> 29:41.160\nYou got to open up.\n\n29:41.160 --> 29:42.160\nNothing's changing.\n\n29:42.160 --> 29:44.240\nWell, something's changing.\n\n29:44.240 --> 29:51.400\nThis is where the kid always goes, you're paying attention to me, that's one thing.\n\n29:51.400 --> 29:53.960\nThat's the worst thing in the world.\n\n29:53.960 --> 29:56.360\nYou're fucking, that's so sad.\n\n29:56.360 --> 29:59.320\nLike what, we live in a society where attention is currency.\n\n29:59.320 --> 30:00.320\nIt's also.\n\n30:00.320 --> 30:03.960\nThe attention of criminals, like you fucking, like, handcuff, that's the problem.\n\n30:03.960 --> 30:09.760\nBut your attention is delivered to you electronically instantly with a system that notifies you.\n\n30:09.760 --> 30:13.080\nThis country was founded on the idea that being left alone was a luxury.\n\n30:13.080 --> 30:17.760\nLike, if people were like, like noticing you, it was like, fuck you, don't notice me.\n\n30:17.760 --> 30:20.040\nI got a right to be fucking obscure.\n\n30:20.040 --> 30:22.240\nLike, it's called the pursuit of happiness.\n\n30:22.240 --> 30:25.960\nAnd then like, we invented cameras and it's like, oh, Jerry Springer can save my marriage\n\n30:25.960 --> 30:34.080\nand like, fame means something, fame is important because it's like, if you had, if you had\n\n30:34.080 --> 30:39.320\na big pile of dollars in your hand, like, and they all set a thousand on them.\n\n30:39.320 --> 30:44.040\nSo you're like, you're walking around this big pile of dollar cake.\n\n30:44.040 --> 30:50.240\nLike then everybody around you knows, well, that person has like something, I could use\n\n30:50.240 --> 30:54.760\nthat to buy food, I could get shelter with that, I could get whatever I want, because\n\n30:54.760 --> 30:58.800\nit's like, that's capitalism, this, this is shit that will get you anything.\n\n30:58.800 --> 31:03.480\nSo like those people then go, well, why don't I just beat him up and take this?\n\n31:03.480 --> 31:07.720\nThe answer is because there's nine dudes standing around me who are like wearing sunglasses\n\n31:07.720 --> 31:12.480\nbecause I have so much of this that they all have some and like, why don't they kill me?\n\n31:12.480 --> 31:16.360\nWell, they don't kill me because if they do, like, they'll just like, there's another\n\n31:16.360 --> 31:18.120\nring outward and outward.\n\n31:18.120 --> 31:19.480\nSo that's the whole system.\n\n31:19.480 --> 31:21.680\nWhat was my point?\n\n31:21.680 --> 31:22.840\nWe want to be left alone.\n\n31:22.840 --> 31:23.840\nOh.\n\n31:23.840 --> 31:27.680\nWell, people make this mistake because people because the money came because these people\n\n31:27.680 --> 31:33.240\nat one point, they started going like, OK, let's make a let's let's let's sell everybody\n\n31:33.240 --> 31:36.880\njust nothing like, like, let's just sell them stories and things so you make television\n\n31:36.880 --> 31:37.880\nand movies.\n\n31:37.880 --> 31:39.520\nAnd then people go like, oh, look at Iron Man.\n\n31:39.520 --> 31:44.080\nHe serves ironing today and like, here's my money and then they go, like, thank you\n\n31:44.080 --> 31:45.080\nfor the money.\n\n31:45.080 --> 31:48.600\nAnd it's like, like, we're making money off of like, like, like telling you stuff.\n\n31:48.600 --> 31:52.360\nAnd then the guy on the screen, that guy's famous because you recognize him.\n\n31:52.360 --> 31:55.640\nBecause he stopped at the grocery store, he'd be like, holy shit, Iron Man's buying milk,\n\n31:55.640 --> 31:56.880\nbut he doesn't have to buy milk.\n\n31:56.880 --> 31:58.440\nHe has a guy buy milk for him.\n\n31:58.440 --> 32:03.480\nThat's makes it even more exciting to see him fame and seeing famous people.\n\n32:03.480 --> 32:04.480\nThat's obscure.\n\n32:04.480 --> 32:05.480\nHoly shit.\n\n32:05.480 --> 32:06.480\nThat's so and so over there.\n\n32:06.480 --> 32:08.880\nI'm never going to see this person ever again in my life.\n\n32:08.880 --> 32:11.720\nI may even hate him or love him.\n\n32:11.720 --> 32:12.880\nIt doesn't even matter.\n\n32:12.880 --> 32:16.760\nI just can't leave this room without like something.\n\n32:16.760 --> 32:21.800\nAnd if I had that, then I'd also have money and power and all this stuff, but it's not\n\n32:21.800 --> 32:22.800\ntrue anymore.\n\n32:22.800 --> 32:27.760\nLike, so people tweet you and they go like, hey, fat fuck, what do you do in fat fuck?\n\n32:27.760 --> 32:30.280\nAnd then you go, hey, fuck you, pipsqueak.\n\n32:30.280 --> 32:31.760\nAnd they go, I won.\n\n32:31.760 --> 32:34.680\nBut then they're, it doesn't help them at all.\n\n32:34.680 --> 32:41.200\nWhat they call a victory is the mechanic of Twitter functioning as planned.\n\n32:41.200 --> 32:43.920\nHe tweets at you, you see the tweets.\n\n32:43.920 --> 32:45.760\nThat's not, that's, that's Twitter.\n\n32:45.760 --> 32:46.760\nThat's not a win.\n\n32:46.760 --> 32:47.760\nYeah.\n\n32:47.760 --> 32:50.560\nIt's like, it's like a, it's like a fucking amazing thing about technology.\n\n32:50.560 --> 32:54.480\nLike you shouldn't, you wouldn't like send it, take an X-ray of your broken leg with\n\n32:54.480 --> 32:57.000\nyour phone and send it to your doctor.\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:01.640\nAnd when your doctor says it looks like you have a broken leg, you fucking loser.\n\n33:01.640 --> 33:02.640\nYeah.\n\n33:02.640 --> 33:12.080\nWhy are you, why are you looking at X-rays at home fucking faggot?\n\n33:12.080 --> 33:13.080\nThat's faggot shit.\n\n33:13.080 --> 33:14.080\nLooking at X-rays.\n\n33:14.080 --> 33:19.040\nIf I get self-employed at home doctor looking at X-rays.\n\n33:19.040 --> 33:20.040\nYeah.\n\n33:20.040 --> 33:21.040\nThat's the fascination with phones.\n\n33:21.040 --> 33:27.280\nLike when they come to you, they interest you.\n\n33:27.280 --> 33:28.800\nBroken leg winner.\n\n33:28.800 --> 33:29.800\nOh man.\n\n33:29.800 --> 33:30.800\nOkay.\n\n33:30.800 --> 33:34.280\nI just had the, I had this idea, I should have mentioned it before.\n\n33:34.280 --> 33:38.360\nYou know, when you, people have these mic drop moments, these spike the football moments.\n\n33:38.360 --> 33:42.480\nIt sounds like I was about, you were about to do that before I cut you off.\n\n33:42.480 --> 33:47.280\nBut like what you should do when you have that mic drop moment is you should do the\n\n33:47.280 --> 33:52.360\nNPR sign off like they do because you know, they always end with this awesome or they\n\n33:52.360 --> 33:54.240\nthink it's an awesome line, but it's not.\n\n33:54.240 --> 33:56.200\nAnd then they spike the football with their name.\n\n33:56.200 --> 34:01.000\nThey're like, it looks like these ballet shoes are in lockstep.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:05.080\nI'm Marina Simons NPR News Brazil.\n\n34:05.080 --> 34:17.240\nSo you just be like, hey Dan, are those pants brown or did your shit fall out of your pants?\n\n34:17.240 --> 34:23.400\nI'm Spencer Crittenden NPR News.\n\n34:23.400 --> 34:25.520\nI think we should start that.\n\n34:25.520 --> 34:28.520\nIs that your face or did your neck throw up from Washington?\n\n34:28.520 --> 34:29.920\nI'm Corey Flintoff.\n\n34:29.920 --> 34:32.240\nI just wanted to say Corey Flintoff.\n\n34:32.240 --> 34:38.520\nI was just, I was doing the same thing, but no, I just wanted to say Corey Flintoff.\n\n34:38.520 --> 34:39.520\nIt's a good name.\n\n34:39.520 --> 34:41.480\nThey're, they all have amazing names.\n\n34:41.480 --> 34:45.280\nThat's part of what makes the sign off so powerful because it's not the sign off.\n\n34:45.280 --> 34:47.600\nYou know, they're just saying dumb shit.\n\n34:47.600 --> 34:51.040\nI don't like, like, because most of the time they sound, when they say that, when they\n\n34:51.040 --> 34:54.360\nsay their names, it really sounds like they're like, yeah, I really nailed it.\n\n34:54.360 --> 34:59.840\nBut most of the time it's just really lackluster and it's like, it looks like autumn has come\n\n34:59.840 --> 35:01.960\nto town.\n\n35:01.960 --> 35:03.720\nI'm Corey Flintoff NPR.\n\n35:03.720 --> 35:08.080\nAnd like, it's just like, why, that's your, I don't know, he sounds so smug.\n\n35:08.080 --> 35:11.880\nHave you ever been listening to an NPR piece and they, they have that cadence and so you\n\n35:11.880 --> 35:19.080\nthink it's going to end and then it doesn't, they go like, so, and that's, and that's when\n\n35:19.080 --> 35:24.520\nhomelessness becomes something where the heart is.\n\n35:24.520 --> 35:34.880\nDavid walks to Dunkin' Donuts and you're like, yeah, I was ready to move on.\n\n35:34.880 --> 35:41.840\nLet's let's do, let's do a, let's do a segment called my friend, my friend needs a job.\n\n35:41.840 --> 35:42.840\nBecause Marley, are you here?\n\n35:42.840 --> 35:43.840\nCan you come out on stage?\n\n35:43.840 --> 35:44.840\nMarley, Marley Nelson?\n\n35:44.840 --> 35:45.840\nIt might take him a bit.\n\n35:45.840 --> 35:47.240\nI think he's in the audience.\n\n35:47.240 --> 35:48.240\nOkay.\n\n35:48.240 --> 35:49.240\nHe can't clamber up the.\n\n35:49.240 --> 35:50.760\nHe will, but it just might take a bit.\n\n35:50.760 --> 35:51.760\nYeah.\n\n35:51.760 --> 35:52.760\nOr I hope he will.\n\n35:52.760 --> 35:53.760\nI don't want to speak for him.\n\n35:53.760 --> 35:56.440\nWhen he gets here, we're going to give him a job.\n\n35:56.440 --> 35:57.440\nI know what you're thinking.\n\n35:57.440 --> 36:00.720\nIt's, it's, I came here to give.\n\n36:00.720 --> 36:01.720\nWhat can I give?\n\n36:01.720 --> 36:04.640\nI drove from Phoenix.\n\n36:04.640 --> 36:13.480\nI paid $35 and I want to engage in charity.\n\n36:13.480 --> 36:19.600\nStanding in line was my duty and now begins my obligation.\n\n36:19.600 --> 36:23.080\nThat's what you're thinking.\n\n36:23.080 --> 36:24.560\nIsn't a duty an obligation?\n\n36:24.560 --> 36:28.120\nA duty, a duty is a necessity sometimes.\n\n36:28.120 --> 36:29.760\nMarley, everybody.\n\n36:29.760 --> 36:31.760\nAll right.\n\n36:31.760 --> 36:33.760\nHi Marley.\n\n36:33.760 --> 36:45.200\nAll right, Marley, Marley, I met you because you, wait, are we, should we not say how I\n\n36:45.200 --> 36:47.520\nmet you because is that, oh, fuck them, man.\n\n36:47.520 --> 36:48.520\nYeah.\n\n36:48.520 --> 36:49.520\nOkay.\n\n36:49.520 --> 36:50.520\nYeah.\n\n36:50.520 --> 36:54.520\nWell, I met you because you were working at the hotel I was staying at and you, you're,\n\n36:54.520 --> 37:00.600\nyou're, you're, you're a, you're a very hospitable person and then, and then while I was gone\n\n37:00.600 --> 37:05.160\nat one point you got fired from the hotel because you weren't, I don't know what the\n\n37:05.160 --> 37:06.160\nstory was.\n\n37:06.160 --> 37:08.040\nWell, the story was a little complicated.\n\n37:08.040 --> 37:13.480\nIt was one person said this, another person said that, but essentially I kind of had sex\n\n37:13.480 --> 37:16.080\nupstairs and it was frowned upon.\n\n37:16.080 --> 37:17.080\nRight.\n\n37:17.080 --> 37:20.760\nApparently you can't do that type of thing at work.\n\n37:20.760 --> 37:25.680\nIn a hotel, when there's that, the only thing that is in a hotel is a bunch of empty beds.\n\n37:25.680 --> 37:26.680\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n37:26.680 --> 37:30.080\nIf you work in a hotel and you're doing a good enough job.\n\n37:30.080 --> 37:31.880\nOne plus one is two.\n\n37:31.880 --> 37:40.640\nThat's what I mean, like, that's the first time you've ever told me that, by the way.\n\n37:40.640 --> 37:47.360\nI didn't bring him up because I knew the reason he got fired was awesome.\n\n37:47.360 --> 37:51.960\nHe told me he wasn't at his post, but it sounds like you were.\n\n37:51.960 --> 37:59.200\nI had to keep it professional, you know, like, but I was posting though, it was, it was.\n\n37:59.200 --> 38:04.720\nAll right, so, and you were, you know, you're, if you can make friends with me, it means\n\n38:04.720 --> 38:14.080\nyou're, you're either black or, or you're a very friendly, like, or both.\n\n38:14.080 --> 38:16.960\nAnd if you're both, we're friends.\n\n38:16.960 --> 38:21.720\nAnd I, but, but no, but I like, you know, you're, you're, you seem like a good guy.\n\n38:21.720 --> 38:27.000\nI don't think that you're secretly a rapist or anything like I, I also, I don't think\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:28.240\nyou're a secret murderer.\n\n38:28.240 --> 38:29.960\nI don't think you're a secret burglar.\n\n38:29.960 --> 38:33.640\nOh, no, I'm actually really open and honest about my murdering, burglaring.\n\n38:33.640 --> 38:36.600\nSo like, once I do it, you know, it's, it comes through.\n\n38:36.600 --> 38:37.600\nYeah.\n\n38:37.600 --> 38:38.600\nAll right.\n\n38:38.600 --> 38:43.440\nSo what I talked to you earlier before the show and I got some data, like, as you put\n\n38:43.440 --> 38:47.680\nit, because you've tried, you were in the hospitality industry, which you were very good at.\n\n38:47.680 --> 38:48.680\nYes.\n\n38:48.680 --> 38:52.520\nIf I could, if I could start a hotel, I would have you at the front door, like, I would\n\n38:52.520 --> 38:55.200\nknow that you were going to make every guest feel wonderful.\n\n38:55.200 --> 38:56.200\nWell, yeah, 100%.\n\n38:56.200 --> 38:57.200\nThat's the job.\n\n38:57.200 --> 38:58.200\nYeah.\n\n38:58.200 --> 39:00.760\nBut you, you, you went from there to comic book distribution.\n\n39:00.760 --> 39:01.760\nYes, it's true.\n\n39:01.760 --> 39:03.600\nAnd you're currently working in that.\n\n39:03.600 --> 39:05.320\nYou're a big comic book fan.\n\n39:05.320 --> 39:07.320\nYou like Iron Man, you like Spider-Man.\n\n39:07.320 --> 39:08.320\nWhat's your favorite?\n\n39:08.320 --> 39:10.640\nOh, that's a complicated question, man.\n\n39:10.640 --> 39:11.640\nOh, gosh.\n\n39:11.640 --> 39:12.640\nYeah.\n\n39:12.640 --> 39:13.640\nWhoo.\n\n39:13.640 --> 39:19.280\nUh, probably Dr. Doom and Batman would have to be like the, like, pinnacle of comic book\n\n39:19.280 --> 39:20.280\ndoom.\n\n39:20.280 --> 39:21.280\nYou like Dr. Doom.\n\n39:21.280 --> 39:22.280\nYeah.\n\n39:22.280 --> 39:27.160\nLike a guy, you like, like his, you said earlier, you said, you said this election\n\n39:27.160 --> 39:36.600\nis like choosing between Dr. Doom and Red Skull, which means like an insidious, like,\n\n39:36.600 --> 39:37.600\nuh, yeah.\n\n39:37.600 --> 39:38.600\nWell, okay.\n\n39:38.600 --> 39:39.600\nYeah.\n\n39:39.600 --> 39:41.600\nBut you want to work with Dr. Doom because at the end of the day, he's going to take\n\n39:41.600 --> 39:43.160\ncare of you.\n\n39:43.160 --> 39:44.160\nHe's got a lot of varia.\n\n39:44.160 --> 39:45.160\nYeah.\n\n39:45.160 --> 39:46.160\nYeah.\n\n39:46.160 --> 39:47.160\nExactly.\n\n39:47.160 --> 39:48.160\nYou got a lot of varia and they're like, oh, we love doom.\n\n39:48.160 --> 39:49.160\nYeah.\n\n39:49.160 --> 39:50.160\nWe have universal healthcare.\n\n39:50.160 --> 39:51.160\nWe got doom bots.\n\n39:51.160 --> 39:52.160\nWe got doom bots.\n\n39:52.160 --> 39:53.160\nYeah.\n\n39:53.160 --> 39:54.160\nDr. Doom's a both board kind of guy.\n\n39:54.160 --> 39:55.160\nNo, he absolutely is.\n\n39:55.160 --> 39:56.560\nHe's like, I have a chrome face.\n\n39:56.560 --> 39:57.560\nI have a country.\n\n39:57.560 --> 40:01.560\nSome of it's under a hood, but that's because I don't want to look like Destro.\n\n40:01.560 --> 40:08.560\nWell, and, but, but Red Skull is like, I don't want to know, I have a red skull for\n\n40:08.560 --> 40:09.560\na head.\n\n40:09.560 --> 40:11.560\nI'm going to, I'm going to hydra everything.\n\n40:11.560 --> 40:14.560\nThe dude has a red skull like that.\n\n40:14.560 --> 40:16.560\nAnd he's not proud of it.\n\n40:16.560 --> 40:17.560\nNo.\n\n40:17.560 --> 40:18.560\nYeah.\n\n40:18.560 --> 40:19.560\nHe's very upset.\n\n40:19.560 --> 40:20.560\nI don't think that Red Skull was his idea as a name.\n\n40:20.560 --> 40:24.560\nI think, I think he probably was like, I'm Warlock master.\n\n40:24.560 --> 40:29.560\nAnd then like eventually gave in like the way with the big league thing, big league became\n\n40:29.560 --> 40:30.560\nbig league.\n\n40:30.560 --> 40:31.560\nYour skull's red.\n\n40:31.560 --> 40:32.560\nWe should just stick with what we know.\n\n40:32.560 --> 40:33.560\nAll right.\n\n40:33.560 --> 40:37.160\nSo politics is disturbing the, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's muddying the waters here.\n\n40:37.160 --> 40:40.160\nIt's like, it doesn't matter how you feel.\n\n40:40.160 --> 40:47.280\nWhat matters is you're, you tried hospitality, you're now working a comic book distribution.\n\n40:47.280 --> 40:51.560\nWhat you told me, if you had your ideal job, it would be getting high and talking about\n\n40:51.560 --> 40:52.560\ncomics.\n\n40:52.560 --> 40:53.560\nAll day.\n\n40:53.560 --> 40:54.560\nYeah.\n\n40:54.560 --> 40:56.560\nSo is there anybody in New York that is,\n\n40:56.560 --> 40:57.560\nOwns a comic book store.\n\n40:57.560 --> 41:01.560\nHas a business that involves someone along the pipeline getting high and talking about\n\n41:01.560 --> 41:02.560\ncomic books.\n\n41:02.560 --> 41:04.060\nSmoking pot, talking about comic books guys.\n\n41:04.060 --> 41:05.560\nI can do this all day.\n\n41:05.560 --> 41:08.560\nOh, Dustin owns a podcast network.\n\n41:08.560 --> 41:09.560\nYeah.\n\n41:09.560 --> 41:11.560\nI guess you could get high and talk about it.\n\n41:11.560 --> 41:12.560\nYeah.\n\n41:12.560 --> 41:16.560\nI mean, you, you would have to do ads while you got high and talk about comics.\n\n41:16.560 --> 41:17.560\nYou'd have to like go.\n\n41:17.560 --> 41:18.560\nOr comics.\n\n41:18.560 --> 41:19.560\nIron Man's dope.\n\n41:19.560 --> 41:20.560\nOr comics.\n\n41:20.560 --> 41:21.560\nAnd so is Dollar Shave Club.\n\n41:21.560 --> 41:28.060\nLike you'd have to, can you imagine like pitching like just comic book superheroes as if they\n\n41:28.060 --> 41:29.560\nwere podcast ads?\n\n41:29.560 --> 41:35.560\nLike I've been reading Spider-Man for a long time and I got to tell you that it's 20%\n\n41:35.560 --> 41:42.560\noff and Spider-Man has webbing that entangles foes with ease and the strength of six men.\n\n41:42.560 --> 41:43.560\nI don't know.\n\n41:43.560 --> 41:44.560\nIt would be great.\n\n41:44.560 --> 41:47.560\nI mean, maybe it wouldn't.\n\n41:47.560 --> 41:54.560\nAll right, so, so people listening to this will know Marley, Marley Nelson.\n\n41:54.560 --> 41:56.560\nMarley Nelson on Facebook.\n\n41:56.560 --> 41:58.560\nHe's a pot in comics.\n\n41:58.560 -->

43:15.560\nLet's, let's talk about this.\n\n43:15.560 --> 43:17.560\nI have opinions too, but I want to hear yours.\n\n43:17.560 --> 43:21.560\nI mean, it was like, it wasn't, it wasn't Bane at all.\n\n43:21.560 --> 43:22.560\nNo.\n\n43:22.560 --> 43:23.560\nI mean, like, I get what they were trying to do.\n\n43:23.560 --> 43:24.560\nThank you.\n\n43:24.560 --> 43:27.560\nBecause what I wanted to do was like crazy shit, but that wasn't fucking Bane, bro.\n\n43:27.560 --> 43:31.560\nBane's a goddamn mercenary, has nothing to do with League of Assassin's, broke Batman's\n\n43:31.560 --> 43:34.560\nback, did that shit in the whole Nightfall storyline.\n\n43:34.560 --> 43:35.560\nIt was like a whole fucking thing.\n\n43:35.560 --> 43:36.560\nNah, that shit was all fucked up.\n\n43:36.560 --> 43:38.560\nAlso, he's super smart, right?\n\n43:38.560 --> 43:40.560\nLike, like, he's a mastermind and that wasn't represented at all.\n\n43:40.560 --> 43:44.560\nHe's a really good strategist, but he's not like, he's not like Batman level smart.\n\n43:44.560 --> 43:45.560\nWell, no one's Batman.\n\n43:45.560 --> 43:46.560\nYeah, no one's Batman level.\n\n43:46.560 --> 43:47.560\nWell, maybe Brainy.\n\n43:47.560 --> 43:53.560\nI don't like, the movie begins with the idea that he, he's comfortable putting a hood on\n\n43:53.560 --> 43:57.560\nand he's getting on a plane and he's got this whole plan laid out because he apparently\n\n43:57.560 --> 44:02.560\nknows exactly what happens when you surrender to the federal government.\n\n44:02.560 --> 44:04.560\nLike, he knows, he's got a hood on his head.\n\n44:04.560 --> 44:06.560\nYou know, when you hit it like that.\n\n44:06.560 --> 44:11.560\nAnd he's like, and he's like picking his quips and like, and it's like, oh, whoa, that depends.\n\n44:11.560 --> 44:14.560\nAre you afraid of me?\n\n44:14.560 --> 44:16.560\nOh, I'm afraid of you.\n\n44:16.560 --> 44:21.560\nAnd it's like, and he's got this hood on and it's like, what if the fucking guy just pointed\n\n44:21.560 --> 44:24.560\nand blew his brains out like before he had the hood off?\n\n44:24.560 --> 44:26.560\nHe doesn't know that's not going to happen.\n\n44:26.560 --> 44:27.560\nI don't admire that kind of villain.\n\n44:27.560 --> 44:29.560\nHe doesn't plan things.\n\n44:29.560 --> 44:31.560\nLike, the Joker was it, okay, all right.\n\n44:31.560 --> 44:34.560\nIt's just, it was just like, oh, the whole thing is like, oh, he's so logical.\n\n44:34.560 --> 44:35.560\nHe got him right where he wants him.\n\n44:35.560 --> 44:37.560\nBut it's like, there's no internal logic.\n\n44:37.560 --> 44:38.560\nI don't like it.\n\n44:38.560 --> 44:41.560\nI don't like lack of internal logic in my superhero.\n\n44:41.560 --> 44:43.560\nIn the Joker or Bane?\n\n44:43.560 --> 44:47.560\nI mentioned the Joker for a second because it's like, they did a good job of creating a character\n\n44:47.560 --> 44:52.560\nthat could be counted on to do anything other than what made sense because that was his superpower.\n\n44:52.560 --> 44:55.560\nLike, that was a cool Heath Ledger Joker.\n\n44:55.560 --> 44:57.560\nIt was like, we all agree.\n\n44:57.560 --> 44:59.560\nWell, he was the best part of that movie.\n\n44:59.560 --> 45:03.560\nThey made the Joker make sense in that way.\n\n45:03.560 --> 45:06.560\nHe's a compulsive anarchist.\n\n45:06.560 --> 45:08.560\nHe just wants to watch the world burn.\n\n45:08.560 --> 45:11.560\nIt's kind of cheating, but fine, fuck it.\n\n45:11.560 --> 45:15.560\nBut Bane was like, I've got a plan for Gotham.\n\n45:15.560 --> 45:20.560\nI'm going to make sure everyone finds out about the corruption.\n\n45:20.560 --> 45:23.560\nThat's way better than the Bane that we had.\n\n45:23.560 --> 45:29.560\nTo even say this causes me physical discomfort, but I'm going to say it because I love all of you.\n\n45:29.560 --> 45:31.560\nBatman and Robin.\n\n45:31.560 --> 45:33.560\nRight.\n\n45:33.560 --> 45:35.560\nWhat, the movie?\n\n45:35.560 --> 45:36.560\nYeah, that movie.\n\n45:36.560 --> 45:42.560\nThe Bane and that was just like, it was like a slap to the face of everything I've ever known in comic books.\n\n45:42.560 --> 45:45.560\nIt was like, almost as bad as Spider-Man's organic weapon.\n\n45:45.560 --> 45:56.560\nI met Adam West at Stanley's Kamikaze, and it was very uncomfortable.\n\n45:56.560 --> 45:57.560\nWhy?\n\n45:57.560 --> 46:10.560\nBecause I told the comic con organizer, she said, I heard her going like, when Adam West gets here, blah, blah, blah, and I was like,\n\n46:10.560 --> 46:18.560\nAdam West here, I'd really like to meet him, and I didn't expect actually steps to be taken that involved putting anyone out.\n\n46:18.560 --> 46:24.560\nAnd then we went to meet Stan Lee, which turns out means that you...\n\n46:24.560 --> 46:27.560\nI kept thinking we were going to be brought into a room.\n\n46:27.560 --> 46:32.560\nIt's like the old Greg Barrett's joke of the New York Times calls him and asks him a few questions,\n\n46:32.560 --> 46:36.560\nand he thinks that he's getting interviews, but they're just selling him a subscription.\n\n46:36.560 --> 46:41.560\nI thought Stan Lee wanted to meet me.\n\n46:41.560 --> 46:45.560\nStan Lee would love to have you at his comic con and meet you, and I was like, of course he does.\n\n46:45.560 --> 46:49.560\nMy time has come.\n\n46:49.560 --> 46:53.560\nHe's got better shit to do.\n\n46:53.560 --> 46:59.560\nIt was more like, oh, well, the comic con, you go in the front of the line, and then you meet Stan Lee, it was fine.\n\n46:59.560 --> 47:08.560\nBut then they were like, we're walking from the comic con out to the van to leave, and this golf cart is speeding up,\n\n47:08.560 --> 47:14.560\nand the comic con organizer leaps into the path of it and flags it down because it's Adam West,\n\n47:14.560 --> 47:17.560\nand Dan Harmon wants to meet Adam West.\n\n47:17.560 --> 47:22.560\nAnd so Adam West is like, who?\n\n47:22.560 --> 47:28.560\nAnd Burt Ward, who's in the back seat, is like, double who?\n\n47:28.560 --> 47:34.560\nBecause he didn't say he wanted to meet Adam West and Burt Ward, so even if he's Barack Obama,\n\n47:34.560 --> 47:37.560\nI don't fucking, fucking shit.\n\n47:37.560 --> 47:44.560\nHoly bullshit, me, man.\n\n47:44.560 --> 47:49.560\nHe's in therapy, and his therapist is teaching him how to, she's like, when you have anger,\n\n47:49.560 --> 47:53.560\nI want you to, it's okay, you can keep saying, holy, whatever's bugging you,\n\n47:53.560 --> 48:00.560\nbut you have to, I want you to start telling yourself instead of Batman.\n\n48:00.560 --> 48:04.560\nHoly divorce, me, man.\n\n48:04.560 --> 48:07.560\nAnd that's as far, anyways, I just thought that was a funny premise.\n\n48:07.560 --> 48:11.560\nI'm not doing myself any favors because the guy doesn't have any reason to like me.\n\n48:11.560 --> 48:14.560\nI said, someone stopped a golf cart, and then it was like, there was just,\n\n48:14.560 --> 48:20.560\nthe whole golf cart was loaded with the entire cast of the Batman original TV show.\n\n48:20.560 --> 48:25.560\nI didn't really, I didn't, I was like, if Adam, and then I was like, Adam,\n\n48:25.560 --> 48:29.560\nthey were like, they're busy, and I found myself angry at them.\n\n48:29.560 --> 48:32.560\nAnd I'm like, why am I mad at them?\n\n48:32.560 --> 48:35.560\nAnd I was also ashamed of myself, because I'm like, what?\n\n48:35.560 --> 48:38.560\nAnd I was like, oh my god, I meet people every day who are going through all this shit,\n\n48:38.560 --> 48:42.560\nnot to flatter myself, I'm just saying, like, I was like, oh, this is always happening.\n\n48:42.560 --> 48:48.560\nIt's like, oh, people going like, I also met Walter Koenig,\n\n48:48.560 --> 48:52.560\nand I had just watched him and Bruce Campbell in Moon,\n\n48:52.560 --> 48:56.560\nwhat was the fucking movie called, Moon Escape?\n\n48:56.560 --> 48:59.560\nIt's an awful movie from the 80s, and Walter Koenig's in it.\n\n48:59.560 --> 49:03.560\nI couldn't fucking, it was like, why am I telling him this?\n\n49:03.560 --> 49:07.560\nLike, it's a shitty movie, he knows it's shitty, like, it's embarrassing,\n\n49:07.560 --> 49:10.560\nand it's like, and I knew it the whole time, and I had 20 minutes to stew on it,\n\n49:10.560 --> 49:16.560\nand then I ended that 20 minutes and said, sir, I had to say it,\n\n49:16.560 --> 49:21.560\nI know it's all that, I know this is a big annoyance and all this stuff,\n\n49:21.560 --> 49:24.560\nbut I have to say, I just watched the shitty movie you were in yesterday,\n\n49:24.560 --> 49:29.560\nwhatever the name of it was, and it just stared at me blankly.\n\n49:29.560 --> 49:32.560\nI'm like, yeah, of course, like, what do you expect of it?\n\n49:32.560 --> 49:34.560\nIt makes me feel sad.\n\n49:34.560 --> 49:42.560\nAnyways, the election's happening, and, sorry about that detour,\n\n49:42.560 --> 49:46.560\nI'd like to bring, her name is Stephanie to the stage.\n\n49:46.560 --> 49:48.560\nStephanie, are you here?\n\n49:48.560 --> 49:50.560\nAre you able to come to the stage?\n\n49:50.560 --> 49:52.560\nI hope so.\n\n49:52.560 --> 49:58.560\nWe met, Marley and I were, Marley's mom.\n\n49:58.560 --> 50:00.560\nStop listening, mom.\n\n50:00.560 --> 50:03.560\nYour son and I were getting high outside the venue,\n\n50:03.560 --> 50:09.560\nand then a couple walked by, and we started, we struck up a conversation,\n\n50:09.560 --> 50:14.560\nand the wife, I think she's, I think they're married,\n\n50:14.560 --> 50:17.560\nshe was just walking her husband to Harmontown,\n\n50:17.560 --> 50:21.560\nand she was going to stand in line with him until he got to the front of the line,\n\n50:21.560 --> 50:23.560\nand then she didn't have a ticket, and she was going to go home,\n\n50:23.560 --> 50:25.560\nbecause she was just going to support him,\n\n50:25.560 --> 50:30.560\nbecause he's a Harmontown fan, so he's not capable of existing on his own, on a sidewalk.\n\n50:30.560 --> 50:41.560\nStephanie, we started to have a seat and take that mic.\n\n50:41.560 --> 50:44.560\nI'm sure you're probably, I don't want to assume this,\n\n50:44.560 --> 50:46.560\nbut I also want to support you if you are,\n\n50:46.560 --> 50:49.560\nobviously you're terrified, or you're nervous, or anxious,\n\n50:49.560 --> 50:52.560\nor is this a normal thing to be in front of,\n\n50:52.560 --> 50:54.560\nyou've been in front of people before?\n\n50:54.560 --> 50:55.560\nOh yeah.\n\n50:55.560 --> 50:59.560\nOkay, good, fine, fuck you, alright.\n\n50:59.560 --> 51:03.560\nBut we talked about, I don't know how it came up,\n\n51:03.560 --> 51:07.560\nbut the idea that you can beatbox just a little bit,\n\n51:07.560 --> 51:09.560\nlike you're not claiming expertise.\n\n51:09.560 --> 51:10.560\nNo.\n\n51:10.560 --> 51:13.560\nYou're not here to take down any Sucka MCs.\n\n51:13.560 --> 51:15.560\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n51:15.560 --> 51:18.560\nIf that's what beatboxers do,\n\n51:18.560 --> 51:22.560\nI don't know in their elaborate chess game,\n\n51:22.560 --> 51:26.560\nlike if the beatboxer is allowed to take down a Sucka MC,\n\n51:26.560 --> 51:29.560\nthat may be something that only a queen can do.\n\n51:29.560 --> 51:31.560\nOr indeed, whether or not they have anything on you.\n\n51:31.560 --> 51:32.560\nRight.\n\n51:32.560 --> 51:33.560\nRight.\n\n51:33.560 --> 51:34.560\nThat was good.\n\n51:34.560 --> 51:37.560\nI stand by that.\n\n51:37.560 --> 51:41.560\nWell, can we get just a little taste?\n\n51:41.560 --> 51:43.560\nIs there anything I can do to make it more comfortable for you?\n\n51:43.560 --> 51:46.560\nDo you want some water, some vodka?\n\n51:46.560 --> 51:48.560\nI'm good, thank you.\n\n51:48.560 --> 51:50.560\nAlright, just a little, it's experimental,\n\n51:50.560 --> 51:53.560\njust a little beatboxing.\n\n51:53.560 --> 52:00.560\nYo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n52:00.560 --> 52:02.560\nNo, Dan, they ain't ready for this one.\n\n52:02.560 --> 52:03.560\nYo.\n\n52:03.560 --> 52:04.560\nAre you ready for this one?\n\n52:04.560 --> 52:05.560\nGive it up.\n\n52:05.560 --> 52:06.560\nYo.\n\n52:06.560 --> 52:07.560\nOh, shit.\n\n52:07.560 --> 52:08.560\nYo.\n\n52:08.560 --> 52:09.560\nOh, man, give it to him, man.\n\n52:09.560 --> 52:10.560\nYo.\n\n52:10.560 --> 52:11.560\nYo.\n\n52:11.560 --> 52:12.560\nYo.\n\n52:12.560 --> 52:14.560\nNew York, New York.\n\n52:14.560 --> 52:16.560\nBig city, a tiny apple.\n\n52:16.560 --> 52:19.560\nI fucked your mom and she gave me some Snapple.\n\n52:19.560 --> 52:21.560\nShe gave it to me on a vending machine.\n\n52:21.560 --> 52:25.560\nI fucked her so hard that one leg gleamed.\n\n52:25.560 --> 52:27.560\nAnd then I took her to dinner.\n\n52:27.560 --> 52:30.560\nI'd call your mom a gender winner.\n\n52:30.560 --> 52:34.560\nShe's an example to us all because I didn't fuck her at all.\n\n52:34.560 --> 52:35.560\nI was lying.\n\n52:35.560 --> 52:37.560\nAnd I'm a weak man.\n\n52:37.560 --> 52:39.560\nAnd your mama should lead this land.\n\n52:39.560 --> 52:43.560\nAnd she's put up with enough and she's shown she has merit.\n\n52:43.560 --> 52:46.560\nI fucked your mom before a ferret.\n\n52:46.560 --> 52:56.560\nThat's not easy to keep up, right?\n\n52:56.560 --> 52:58.560\nI care, Matt.\n\n52:58.560 --> 53:01.560\nBeatboxing filled my hallways in eighth grade.\n\n53:01.560 --> 53:05.560\nIt was my generation's doo-wop.\n\n53:05.560 --> 53:08.560\nI went to a virtually all-black middle school.\n\n53:08.560 --> 53:10.560\nI'm not looking at you, Marley.\n\n53:10.560 --> 53:13.560\nI said the word black.\n\n53:13.560 --> 53:15.560\nI don't see the world through that lens.\n\n53:15.560 --> 53:17.560\nI don't connect those dots.\n\n53:17.560 --> 53:19.560\nThank you, I appreciate it.\n\n53:19.560 --> 53:21.560\nI went to basically all-black middle school\n\n53:21.560 --> 53:24.560\nand it was like one of just a half dozen kids\n\n53:24.560 --> 53:28.560\nthat were bussed in for the computer specialty.\n\n53:28.560 --> 53:30.560\nI don't remember what they called it,\n\n53:30.560 --> 53:33.560\nmagnet schools or desegregation traps or whatever.\n\n53:33.560 --> 53:35.560\nThat wasn't a joke.\n\n53:35.560 --> 53:37.560\nI mean, that was language that was used.\n\n53:37.560 --> 53:39.560\nI went to a magnet school.\n\n53:39.560 --> 53:41.560\nIs that what magnet school is?\n\n53:41.560 --> 53:43.560\nThey take inner-city schools and then they go,\n\n53:43.560 --> 53:46.560\nthis inner-city school is now the agriculture specialty.\n\n53:46.560 --> 53:49.560\nThere's just like nine guys from Wichita.\n\n53:49.560 --> 53:52.560\nThey're like, wait, why would they come from a different...\n\n53:52.560 --> 53:55.560\nWichita was overused in the last show.\n\n53:55.560 --> 53:57.560\nI don't know anything about geography.\n\n53:57.560 --> 53:59.560\nIf you're in Wichita, I'm sorry.\n\n53:59.560 --> 54:01.560\nI couldn't point at you on a map.\n\n54:01.560 --> 54:04.560\nYou're fine. You're a fine human being.\n\n54:04.560 --> 54:07.560\nWhy am I characterizing you as anything other than\n\n54:07.560 --> 54:10.560\nan example of humanity?\n\n54:10.560 --> 54:12.560\nYou're a good person.\n\n54:12.560 --> 54:14.560\nWhere was I?\n\n54:14.560 --> 54:16.560\nOh, all black.\n\n54:16.560 --> 54:18.560\nYeah, so everywhere.\n\n54:18.560 --> 54:20.560\nYou just walked down the hall between classes\n\n54:20.560 --> 54:23.560\nand just literally like three dudes,\n\n54:23.560 --> 54:25.560\nany three dudes.\n\n54:25.560 --> 54:28.560\nThere would be one guy freestyling\n\n54:28.560 --> 54:30.560\nand then maybe trading off.\n\n54:30.560 --> 54:33.560\nIt was like triplets.\n\n54:33.560 --> 54:39.560\nSo I kind of learned to beatbox a little bit too.\n\n54:39.560 --> 54:41.560\nThat was my only point.\n\n54:41.560 --> 54:44.560\nWhy do you know how to beatbox?\n\n54:44.560 --> 54:49.560\nMy first exposure to beatboxing was Razzelle, of course.\n\n54:49.560 --> 54:51.560\nJust YouTube videos.\n\n54:51.560 --> 54:53.560\nWas Razzelle, of course?\n\n54:53.560 --> 54:57.560\nJust Razzelle, comma, of course.\n\n54:57.560 --> 54:59.560\nThe of course is what puzzles me\n\n54:59.560 --> 55:02.560\nbecause the of course implies I should know who Razzelle is.\n\n55:02.560 --> 55:04.560\nAnd I don't know what...\n\n55:04.560 --> 55:06.560\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n55:06.560 --> 55:09.560\nHe was one of the pioneers of beatboxing.\n\n55:09.560 --> 55:12.560\nWhat about the human beatbox and the fat boys?\n\n55:12.560 --> 55:14.560\nI always assumed he was the first beatbox\n\n55:14.560 --> 55:16.560\nbecause his name was the human beatbox.\n\n55:16.560 --> 55:18.560\nRight, yeah.\n\n55:18.560 --> 55:20.560\nWas there someone before him?\n\n55:20.560 --> 55:24.560\nHe had a person who was almost literally his Razzelle ghoul.\n\n55:24.560 --> 55:26.560\nThat was good.\n\n55:26.560 --> 55:29.560\nHis name is almost Razzelle ghoul.\n\n55:29.560 --> 55:32.560\nI also noticed that, yeah.\n\n55:32.560 --> 55:35.560\nIt goes into the whole Razz-Rache dispute.\n\n55:35.560 --> 55:37.560\nThen you have people fighting and stuff\n\n55:37.560 --> 55:39.560\nand people say Rache-al ghoul.\n\n55:39.560 --> 55:41.560\nSome people say Razzelle ghoul.\n\n55:41.560 --> 55:43.560\nI hate that stuff.\n\n55:43.560 --> 55:45.560\nIt's fucking annoying. I just, like, fuck off.\n\n55:45.560 --> 55:47.560\nThey should spell it differently if they want you to say it,\n\n55:47.560 --> 55:49.560\nnot like the letters are.\n\n55:49.560 --> 55:51.560\nExactly.\n\n55:51.560 --> 55:53.560\nIf it's Rache-al ghoul, there's a goddamn H at the end.\n\n55:53.560 --> 55:56.560\nThere's all sorts of letters they could use that they're not.\n\n55:56.560 --> 55:58.560\nYeah. Sorry.\n\n56:01.560 --> 56:06.560\nDid this Razzelle guy, was he like the actual pioneer of beatboxing?\n\n56:06.560 --> 56:11.560\nNo, no, no. He was just the first person I saw, like, online.\n\n56:11.560 --> 56:13.560\nWhat era was he?\n\n56:13.560 --> 56:16.560\nHe was the 80s, late 80s, early 90s.\n\n56:16.560 --> 56:19.560\nMostly, yeah, 80s, early 90s.\n\n56:19.560 --> 56:23.560\nIt would be, you know, you got Busy Bee, obviously Doug E. Fresh,\n\n56:23.560 --> 56:25.560\nthen Yes, Big Buff Love.\n\n56:25.560 --> 56:28.560\nThere was a lot in the late 70s and early 80s doing a lot of beatboxing.\n\n56:28.560 --> 56:30.560\nWas Doug E. Fresh doing his own beatboxing?\n\n56:30.560 --> 56:32.560\nYeah.\n\n56:32.560 --> 56:34.560\nHe was like, the only thing I know is him and Slick Rick.\n\n56:34.560 --> 56:38.560\nYeah, yeah. Children's Story, Mona Lisa, yeah, they killed that shit.\n\n56:38.560 --> 56:44.560\nOkay, so, alright, so, wait, I think that's the end of my questions, I think.\n\n56:44.560 --> 56:47.560\nBecause we know the same amount about beatboxing.\n\n56:47.560 --> 56:49.560\nI'm a bad interviewer.\n\n56:55.560 --> 56:57.560\nYeah, but she was really good, like, really good.\n\n56:57.560 --> 56:59.560\nDid we ever hang out? Remember?\n\n56:59.560 --> 57:01.560\nYeah, no, for sure.\n\n57:01.560 --> 57:04.560\nOkay, guys, this, I...\n\n57:04.560 --> 57:07.560\nIs the sound going to be audible?\n\n57:07.560 --> 57:09.560\nWell, whatever, we'll find out.\n\n57:09.560 --> 57:13.560\nYeah, I'm staying in a hotel with my girlfriend,\n\n57:13.560 --> 57:17.560\nand we fart in front of each other now,\n\n57:17.560 --> 57:19.560\nbut, like, I...\n\n57:21.560 --> 57:23.560\nI don't know what that is.\n\n57:23.560 --> 57:31.560\nGod damn it, I'm so scared we're going to just find Steve Levy's The Fall Journal.\n\n57:31.560 --> 57:36.560\nJust, I just, I was so dread, like, just the hand sketches of women's hair\n\n57:36.560 --> 57:43.560\ngoing over their shoulder, just a red marker across the eyes or something.\n\n57:43.560 --> 57:46.560\nAnyways, I, maybe I, maybe I tipped...\n\n57:46.560 --> 57:50.560\nHere, I still, like, I try not to fart in front of her,\n\n57:50.560 --> 57:54.560\nor try to go to the bathroom and, you know,\n\n57:54.560 --> 57:56.560\nsometimes if I feel like it's going to be a loud one,\n\n57:56.560 --> 57:58.560\nI'll turn on the water.\n\n57:58.560 --> 58:03.560\nAnd I think I got away with this one, and I wanted to share it with you.\n\n58:03.560 --> 58:06.560\nOh, shit, okay.\n\n58:06.560 --> 58:18.560\nThat's the water going on.\n\n58:28.560 --> 58:30.560\nI don't think she heard it.\n\n58:30.560 --> 58:36.560\nI don't see, she was sound asleep.\n\n58:36.560 --> 58:38.560\nThat was a really good one, though.\n\n58:38.560 --> 58:42.560\nThat was, that was a solid eight. Solid eight.\n\n58:42.560 --> 58:50.560\nI think my hesitant...\n\n58:50.560 --> 58:54.560\nIt's, it had an M sound, it was like...\n\n58:54.560 --> 58:57.560\nIt wasn't like a, it was not percussive.\n\n58:57.560 --> 59:00.560\nIt's not like, it wasn't like a... It was roaning.\n\n59:00.560 --> 59:03.560\nIt was like...\n\n59:03.560 --> 59:07.560\nIt has something to say.\n\n59:11.560 --> 59:14.560\nOh, shit, play that again, play that again.\n\n59:14.560 --> 59:17.560\nI think I know what it's saying.\n\n59:20.560 --> 59:22.560\nNo, I didn't, I didn't, I got it wrong.\n\n59:22.560 --> 59:28.560\nYou thought, you thought it was like a desalinization of seawater.\n\n59:28.560 --> 59:30.560\nLike it was like a secret...\n\n59:30.560 --> 59:31.560\nYeah, yeah.\n\n59:31.560 --> 59:35.560\nNo, I just, I had an idea, and then that was just the lowest common denominator.\n\n59:35.560 --> 59:37.560\nSo I jettisoned.\n\n59:37.560 --> 59:39.560\nI mean, there's a happy guy.\n\n59:39.560 --> 59:43.560\nRemember that, you know, for those of you that were at the last show,\n\n59:43.560 --> 59:46.560\nyou know, there was some question about my level of happiness,\n\n59:46.560 --> 59:50.560\nand I think this is a happy person.\n\n59:50.560 --> 59:55.560\nI think it's foolish to characterize me as having personality disorders,\n\n59:55.560 --> 59:57.560\nand that actually got to me a little bit.\n\n59:57.560 --> 59:59.560\nI don't know how many of you were at the thing.\n\n59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.560\nAs a joke, we Googled me, and we ended up at this art,\n\n01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.560\nand it was like, oh, Dan Harmon's a piece of shit,\n\n01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.560\nbecause he yelled at a kid on Twitter,\n\n01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.560\nand like read the whole article and read the thing.\n\n01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.560\nThe comments.\n\n01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.560\nI walked away, the comments section, and it was like,\n\n01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.560\nyeah, I'm fine with this, I'm fine with all of it.\n\n01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.560\nAnd then I noticed through the rest of the night,\n\n01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.560\nI was actually really bummed out.\n\n01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.560\nIt was on me, it was in me.\n\n01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.560\nIt's toxicity, it spreads.\n\n01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:35.560\nSo are you supposed to confront the things that make you feel bad,\n\n01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.560\nor are you supposed to, because that just made me feel bad?\n\n01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.560\nA little bit.\n\n01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.560\nI think you're supposed to just kind of filter it.\n\n01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:46.560\nYou have to remove that toxicity from the universe using yourself.\n\n01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.560\nKind of like process it through, and like filter it out,\n\n01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.560\nand like expel that shit, you know, like acknowledge it,\n\n01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.560\nand then just be like, fuck you, you're a piece of shit,\n\n01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.560\nI don't have to answer to you, and like...\n\n01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.560\nOh, he did that for hours.\n\n01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.560\nYeah.\n\n01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.560\nYeah, that's what I'm saying.\n\n01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.560\nSmoking hot, you know, chill out.\n\n01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.560\nThe proudest thing to me is the finger.\n\n01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:16.560\nI think that's so meta, because I'm like,\n\n01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.560\nI think for a moment about being adorable,\n\n01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:25.560\nbut the thing about being adorable is that it's all about hesitation.\n\n01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:30.560\nThat's an image of, oh, should I strike a hesitant pose?\n\n01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.560\nAnd then I was like, I hesitate to do that.\n\n01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:48.560\nI'm like, quadruped adorable.\n\n01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.560\nDon't you think that women are heroes?\n\n01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:56.560\nLike, aren't they just better people?\n\n01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.560\nBecause isn't that gross?\n\n01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.560\nAnd can you imagine, like, either she was asleep,\n\n01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.560\nor she ignored it, or she loves me,\n\n01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.560\nlike she acts like it's fun, like she loves it.\n\n01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.560\nShe and I farted on a candle together.\n\n01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.560\nThat is fucking lovely, I like that.\n\n01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.560\nI was like, I was trying to fart on a candle for her,\n\n01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.560\nfor her entertainment, and then I was like,\n\n01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.560\nthrusting out, I was really wanted to,\n\n01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.560\nand then I heard a weird sound,\n\n01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.560\nand I looked back and she had creeped out of bed\n\n01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.560\nand was like, on the other side of the candle.\n\n01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.560\nThat's amazing.\n\n01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.560\nYeah, I mean, it's hard to, it's hard to define love.\n\n01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.560\nYou can't just say, I...\n\n01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.560\nI feel like you just did, bro.\n\n01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.560\nI love you.\n\n01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.560\nYou have to, like, it all comes in the form of,\n\n01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.560\nlike, specific things, and that wouldn't be the same.\n\n01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.560\nLike, that's not Bridget Jones' definition of love.\n\n01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.560\nI haven't seen the third movie yet,\n\n01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.560\nbut I don't know if, I don't think it changes.\n\n01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.560\nI don't think she wants someone to fart on a candle with her.\n\n01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.560\nStephanie, what's it like being with a Harmontown fan?\n\n01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.560\nIt's awesome.\n\n01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.560\nHe's the best.\n\n01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.560\nI love him.\n\n01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.560\nHe's introduced me to, he's made,\n\n01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.560\nhe's helping me appreciate humor more,\n\n01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.560\nhe's more funny than me by a long shot.\n\n01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.560\nI've been getting into improv lately,\n\n01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.560\nwhich I'm not so great at.\n\n01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.560\nIt sounds like he's got some kind of gaslight,\n\n01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.560\nlike, a stockhole, like, yeah,\n\n01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.560\nStepford thing over here.\n\n01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.560\nI bet you're better than him in every way.\n\n01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.560\nHe sounds like a terrible person.\n\n01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.560\nYeah, that's what makes people funny.\n\n01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.560\nTerrible people are funny people.\n\n01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.560\nRight?\n\n01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:55.560\nI fucking love myself.\n\n01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.560\nWhy am I so happy?\n\n01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.560\nI love how old I'm getting,\n\n01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.560\nI love how

01:08:05.560\nthat's a terrible way to approach creativity.\n\n01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.560\nSo women are awesome.\n\n01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.560\nThe alternative is you just say how you actually feel,\n\n01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.560\nand knowing that someone out there\n\n01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.560\nmight put a Reddit post and say,\n\n01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.560\nlike, she's got a lot of

that the dialogue on women\n\n01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.560\nhas become so much more the forefront\n\n01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.560\nof everything right now,\n\n01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.560\nand for once, people are angry at the things\n\n01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.560\nthat Donald Trump and like are saying,\n\n01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.560\nwhich is huge.\n\n01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.560\nJust the fact that there are so many women and men\n\n01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.560\ncoming out and saying that's so or not okay,\n\n01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.560\nit's so or not okay that we would actually vote\n\n01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.560\nfor someone of the opposite party, for example,\n\n01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.560\nbased on just these comments,\n\n01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.560\nlittle on policy and all those other issues that are nasty.\n\n01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.560\nI don't even know what's going on with Republican women.\n\n01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.560\nThat already sounded like an oxymoron\n\n01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.560\nbefore this election.\n\n01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.560\nBut then again, somebody's a Republican woman.\n\n01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560\nThey exist, there's lots of them, right?\n\n01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.560\nI don't know what the numbers were,\n\n01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.560\nbut you've been paying more attention to that than me.\n\n01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:14.560\nHas there been a huge exodus from GOP women\n\n01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.560\nthat are saying like, this guy's the worst\n\n01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.560\nand it has to do with who I am,\n\n01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.560\nlike fuck fiscal policy, fuck class struggle,\n\n01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.560\nfuck cultural shock, like for this four years,\n\n01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.560\nI'm with her.\n\n01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.560\nHave you encountered, seen that?\n\n01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.560\nSo in my social circles,\n\n01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.560\nI generally congregate with liberal women\n\n01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.560\nand liberal men who are like minded.\n\n01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.560\nBut from my readings in the Washington Post,\n\n01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:52.560\nI see more and more women of every political leaning\n\n01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.560\nsaying, you know, I'm with her.\n\n01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.560\nHe's a pig, yeah.\n\n01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.560\nAll right, well, it's too light.\n\n01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.560\nThere's nothing we can do about it.\n\n01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.560\nLook at those airs after the apocalypse.\n\n01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.560\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.560\nAll we can really do is...\n\n01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:15.560\n...in like a lamb, out like a lion.\n\n01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.560\nLike how happy I am.\n\n01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.560\nIt's like I don't know the world is at stake.\n\n01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.560\nIs this guy even going to vote?\n\n01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.560\nLook at his face.\n\n01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.560\nThis guy may not even vote.\n\n01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.560\nHe may just get out one of his hands\n\n01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.560\nand say, you know what?\n\n01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560\nI don't know.\n\n01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.560\nHe may not even vote.\n\n01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.560\nHe may just get out one of his old stickers from the drawer.\n\n01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.560\nJust to stick on it.\n\n01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.560\nI was like, oh, there's a lot of lint on it,\n\n01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.560\nso there's scotch tape behind it.\n\n01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.560\nSo this is from the...\n\n01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.560\nThis is from the Nader election.\n\n01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.560\nStill stick straight to my shirt.\n\n01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.560\nNow, I'm going to, yeah...\n\n01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.560\nI mean, I'm going to go and

01:11:11.560\nwhich are left of anarchy,\n\n01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.560\nwhich means I wish that everybody that ever thought\n\n01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.560\nthey had the right to tell us what to do\n\n01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.560\nwould die in a fucking inferno.\n\n01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.560\nLike, so who do you vote for?\n\n01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.560\nThe Green Party?\n\n01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.560\nI don't like them either.\n\n01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.560\nI know there's got to be a better way,\n\n01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.560\nbut I also don't like the look on people's faces\n\n01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.560\nif I tell them I didn't vote\n\n01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.560\nand the posturing about how the system isn't going to work\n\n01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.560\nand all this stuff.\n\n01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.560\nI would never, ever, ever tell anybody\n\n01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.560\nthat was choosing to write in their roommate\n\n01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.560\nor vote for a third-party candidate\n\n01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.560\nor even not to go vote.\n\n01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.560\nAt the point where you're bullying those people,\n\n01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.560\nyou've got to step back and ask yourself,\n\n01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.560\nall they're saying is they're not voting\n\n01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.560\nfor this particular fucking system,\n\n01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.560\nand if your only advertisement for it is to yell at them,\n\n01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.560\nlike, what do you expect them to do?\n\n01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.560\nOh, yeah, so sorry.\n\n01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.560\nLike, if you want them to be a fan of democracy,\n\n01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.560\nat least give them the space to waste their vote.\n\n01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.560\nLike, that should be their right.\n\n01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.560\nAnd I'm going to, but I always go,\n\n01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.560\nI'm going to go pull the lever for the Democratic candidate\n\n01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.560\nbecause this fucking guy is an emergency\n\n01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:26.560\nand I resent the fact that I should be tending to an emergency\n\n01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.560\nwith my fucking vote.\n\n01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.560\nThat shouldn't be my vote's job.\n\n01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.560\nLike, so I'm, like, but it's not the time to protest\n\n01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.560\nbecause both voting and protest voting\n\n01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.560\naren't going to make a fucking difference.\n\n01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.560\nThat's the problem.\n\n01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.560\nRevolution doesn't happen behind that curtain.\n\n01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.560\nIf anything behind that curtain could happen\n\n01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.560\nthat was powerful, it would have been made illegal\n\n01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.560\na long time ago.\n\n01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.560\nAnd so, but I'm going to go do it out of solidarity\n\n01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.560\nand then I'm, like, we got to fucking for real.\n\n01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.560\nWe got to, like, figure out how to get to, like,\n\n01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.560\nwe got to...\n\n01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.560\nYeah.\n\n01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.560\nAnd then, like, we got to fix this.\n\n01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.560\nWe got to, like, if you're a human being\n\n01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.560\nand you're, like, living within the system,\n\n01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.560\nlike, you have the right to go stand out on the street corner\n\n01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.560\nand say, I don't like the system.\n\n01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.560\nI think it should change.\n\n01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.560\nAnd if somebody comes and stuns you with a taser\n\n01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.560\nand, like, puts you in a van,\n\n01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.560\nthen you've done your job that day.\n\n01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.560\nLike, because you've proven, like,\n\n01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.560\nwhen we give AIDS to cancer,\n\n01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.560\nas we talked about in a previous episode,\n\n01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.560\nyou're alerting white blood cells\n\n01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.560\nto a thing that should be fought.\n\n01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:42.560\nAnd we'll get started on that after Tuesday.\n\n01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.560\nLike, we got to, we got to just go, like,\n\n01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.560\nokay, that's great, historical.\n\n01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.560\nShe's president, like, now let's fix this shit.\n\n01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.560\nThese people are born rich.\n\n01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.560\nThey have no fucking entitlement to talk to us like animals.\n\n01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.560\nWe got to have representative democracy.\n\n01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.560\nAnd then just, like...\n\n01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.560\nIt's, I'm so proud of it.\n\n01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.560\nLike, look at me.\n\n01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.560\nLook at, there's a woman that loves him.\n\n01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.560\nAnd she's gorgeous.\n\n01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.560\nShe's amazing looking.\n\n01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.560\nThat's not why I like her.\n\n01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.560\nI noticed how hot she was,\n\n01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.560\nlike, three conversations into\n\n01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.560\nmaking intellectual love to her.\n\n01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.560\nIs that, do I protest too much?\n\n01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560\nThat's beautiful.\n\n01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.560\nOkay.\n\n01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560\nAll right, give me a beatbox.\n\n01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560\nLet's do a New York rap.\n\n01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.560\nAnd then, and I want to, I want to,\n\n01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.560\nlike, wait, five, wait, what time is it?\n\n01:14:42.560

available\n\n01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.560\nfor somebody from the city that's feeling pain.\n\n01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.560\nOr pleasure.\n\n01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.560\nYo.\n\n01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.560\nYo.\n\n01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:31.560\n130th Street to 65th took the subway down\n\n01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:35.560\nand I smoked a spliff of reefer weed.\n\n01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.560\nI fucked your mama because she was in need.\n\n01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:45.560\nI'm a charitable contributor to your mama's pussy with my dick\n\n01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.560\nand my balls every summer, spring, winter and fall.\n\n01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:56.560\nI put my penis in her vagina from New York to North Carolina.\n\n01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:00.560\nThe eastern seaboard is your mama's pussy.\n\n01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.560\nThe eastern seaboard is your mama's\n\n01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.560\nand I was like, one syllable for vagina.\n\n01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.560\nNothing acceptable.\n\n01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.560\nNo, there's no such thing as a one syllable word for a vagina\n\n01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.560\nthat's going to end your rap well.\n\n01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.560\nWe should come up with one.\n\n01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.560\nBob.\n\n01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.560\nI'm pitching.\n\n01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.560\nJust call

01:16:26.560\nBob.\n\n01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.560\nBob.\n\n01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:28.560\nBob.\n\n01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.560\nJust call it Bob.\n\n01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.560\nBob.\n\n01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.560\nBob.\n\n01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.560\nOh, no.\n\n01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.560\nBox is gross.\n\n01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:38.560\nIt's all gross if it's one syllable, I think.\n\n01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.560\nIs there a one syllable word for...\n\n01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.560\nWhat?\n\n01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.560\nWe know those ones.\n\n01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.560\nCunt is all the way over into like refreshing,\n\n01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.560\nlike it's like the N word of vaginas.\n\n01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:48.560\nVeg.\n\n01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.560\nVeg.\n\n01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.560\nVeg.\n\n01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.560\nCome on, gang.\n\n01:16:52.560 -->

name...\n\n01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.560\nI know they exist.\n\n01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:08.560\nMy question is, are there ones that make us feel comfortable?\n\n01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.560\nVag is fine.\n\n01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.560\nVag is...\n\n01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.560\nVag is good.\n\n01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560\nVag is... I'm never saying it.\n\n01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:17.560\nBut that's for bridal showers.\n\n01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.560\nVag seems okay.\n\n01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.560\nI'll let you ladies take that one back.\n\n01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.560\nHow about slit?\n\n01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.560\nDo people say slit?\n\n01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.560\nOh, that's gross, too.\n\n01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.560\nWait, was that bad?\n\n01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.560\nI don't know.\n\n01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.560\nI think it's just gross.\n\n01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.560\nIt's like if you called it mud or something.\n\n01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560\nNo one wants to do that.\n\n01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.560\nWho doesn't like to play in some mud?\n\n01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.560\nWell, without question.\n\n01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.560\nYeah, there's no...\n\n01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.560\nLike, there should be one that's like earth.\n\n01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.560\nOr...\n\n01:17:45.560

hole?\n\n01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.560\nHole.\n\n01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.560\nOh, hole?\n\n01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.560\nNo, hole.\n\n01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.560\nWith an H.\n\n01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.560\nNo, hole's bad.\n\n01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.560\nWith an H.\n\n01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:57.560\nYes.\n\n01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.560\nI know.\n\n01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.560\nI get

boo everything.\n\n01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.560\nLike, I'm just...\n\n01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.560\nI thought slit and rug were really good.\n\n01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.560\nI mean, slit's clever.\n\n01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.560\nIt's just...\n\n01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.560\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.560\nJust saying it's like moist.\n\n01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.560\nIt does feel a little dirty.\n\n01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.560\nIt does feel a little dirty.\n\n01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.560\nIt's not like it's...\n\n01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.560\nBean?\n\n01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.560\nBean.\n\n01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560\nThat's like the most important part.\n\n01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560\nAll right.\n\n01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.560\nHere's my pitch.\n\n01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.560\nOkay, you're going to say I'm white knighting.\n\n01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.560\nHere it is.\n\n01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.560\nFor real pitch.\n\n01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.560\nImagine using this in slang.\n\n01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.560\nIt would be awesome.\n\n01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.560\nLife.\n\n01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:33.560\nYo, son, you get some of that life?\n\n01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.560\nNo, I was all up in that life last night.\n\n01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.560\nYou get that life?\n\n01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:38.560\nYeah.\n\n01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.560\nThat's like that was the worst guy's got.\n\n01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.560\nAnd then it was like, yeah, like we get it.\n\n01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.560\nIt's life.\n\n01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.560\nThat's why we want it.\n\n01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.560\nYeah.\n\n01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.560\nAnd like, it's still gross, but like, because we're objectifying it, but we're at least\n\n01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:57.560\nlike a cosmology like placing it like it's like, yo, yo, yo, yo, son, you get some of\n\n01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:00.560\nthat life?\n\n01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:06.560\nSo I, a lady called out, a lady called out that holes don't have agency.\n\n01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.560\nOh, they do.\n\n01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.560\nThey don't.\n\n01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.560\nThey don't.\n\n01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:10.560\nThey should.\n\n01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.560\nHow, how would we...\n\n01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.560\nThey should.\n\n01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.560\nThey should.\n\n01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:19.560\nBut I think we could give holes agency like we can make that happen.\n\n01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.560\nHow would you give a whole agency though?\n\n01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.560\nWell, oh, oh, linguistically, you mean.\n\n01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:27.560\nUh, well, like a Sarlacc pit, like, I mean.\n\n01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.560\nRight.\n\n01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.560\nIt's like a gatekeeper in that sense.\n\n01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.560\nHow do you give a whole agency?\n\n01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.560\nWell, I mean, I, yeah.\n\n01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.560\nYou put a door on it.\n\n01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.560\nYou put a door on it.\n\n01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.560\nYeah.\n\n01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.560\nThen it's a hole.\n\n01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.560\nIt's not just like something that can be affected.\n\n01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:48.560\nThen it's

more meaningful because it involves remembering.\n\n01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:34.560\nThe remembering is built in to the eight 11 commemoration.\n\n01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:38.560\nIt's like part nine 11 part memorial.\n\n01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.560\nI agree.\n\n01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:45.560\nUh, is, is, is anybody, uh, anybody here?\n\n01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.560\nUh, let's say I want to ask for

know, like prison.\n\n01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:17.560\nOkay.\n\n01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.560\nJared.\n\n01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:21.560\nWell, are you young enough to ask how old you are?\n\n01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.560\nI just turned 25 a few days ago.\n\n01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.560\nAdorable.\n\n01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:26.560\nNice.\n\n01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.560\nThank you.\n\n01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.560\nWelcome to earth.\n\n01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.560\nGood luck.\n\n01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.560\nThank you.\n\n01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.560\nWhat, so yeah, tell us about your day.\n\n01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:40.560\nA few, like two, three days ago, I got my gallbladder taken out.\n\n01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:41.560\nYeah.\n\n01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:42.560\nYeah.\n\n01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.560\nIt was my, it was my second procedure in like five days because I like couldn't sleep.\n\n01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:50.560\nIt was this horrible pain every night for like 12 hours.\n\n01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.560\nAnd then they're like, Oh, you've got a thing in your bile duct.\n\n01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.560\nAnd I was like, that's a gross word.\n\n01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.560\nAnd then they got the thing out of the bile duct.\n\n01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.560\nAnd then they're like, Oh, we got the thing out of the bile duct.\n\n01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.560\nBut then we saw what their shit with your gallbladder.\n\n01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:00.560\nSo we need to get that out.\n\n01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:01.560\nSo then I got my gallbladder.\n\n01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.560\nThey haven't figured out when to take your gallbladder out by now.\n\n01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.560\nIt's very popular in women over 40.\n\n01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.560\nDo you just mean the doctors?\n\n01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.560\nLike if you go to the hospital, that's the shift.\n\n01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.560\nIt's like your gallbladders going out.\n\n01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:16.560\nRight.\n\n01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.560\nThey love, they love removing them.\n\n01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:19.560\nYeah.\n\n01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.560\nNo, it, it tend, it's, it's normally like women like in their 40s or 50s to get their\n\n01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:24.560\ngallbladders out.\n\n01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.560\nBut I was having this pain and they're like, Oh, it's probably your gallbladder.\n\n01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.560\nAnd then.\n\n01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.560\nRight.\n\n01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.560\nWhich is a really routine thing.\n\n01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.560\nI mean, not, it's not.\n\n01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:32.560\nNo, it's not like, it's a pretty minor surgeon.\n\n01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.560\nBut I just curious because they said, Oh, they, they bothered to take this like half\n\n01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:39.560\nstep or they're like, there's something in the area of your gallbladder.\n\n01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.560\nIt's like, yeah, motherfucker.\n\n01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.560\nYeah.\n\n01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:42.560\nYeah.\n\n01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.560\nIt's called the gallbladder attack.\n\n01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.560\nRight.\n\n01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.560\nYou've removed the gallbladder.\n\n01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:46.560\nYeah.\n\n01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.560\nI'm, I'm the offensive urban doctor.\n\n01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.560\nRight.\n\n01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:58.560\nMotherfucker, you gotta just give this motherfucker MRI and get over the shit.\n\n01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:06.560\nI'm, I'm, I don't open my mouth when I talk to her.\n\n01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:13.560\nGive this motherfucker a marrow transplant before I bust the fucking.\n\n01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.560\nAll right.\n\n01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.560\nAnyways, as a new character, probably won't stick.\n\n01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.560\nI don't know.\n\n01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.560\nDidn't see workshopped it in New York.\n\n01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:26.560\nIf anyone was going to go for it, it would have been them.\n\n01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:27.560\nDidn't work out.\n\n01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.560\nContinue Jared.\n\n01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.560\nSo anyway, I, I, yeah.\n\n01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:35.560\nSo as for the past few weeks, I've been dealing with this whole like gallbladder and all the\n\n01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.560\npain and stuff.\n\n01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:40.560\nAnd it's, it's, once they took it out, I feel like fucking great except I ate Zinburger\n\n01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.560\ntoday, which was probably, I probably could have made a better choice.\n\n01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.560\nWell, tell us.\n\n01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:45.560\nSo I live today.\n\n01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:46.560\nWell, I'm sorry.\n\n01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:52.560\nI don't want to derail you, but like, I gallbladder, like I've known guys that have the gallbladder\n\n01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.560\nremoved.\n\n01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:56.560\nI feel like it's, it seems like a thing that would happen to me.\n\n01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.560\nLike it's, I seem like a kind of person that would have a gallbladder removed.\n\n01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:04.560\nThe thing is, once it's out, you're just relying on your liver.\n\n01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.560\nFor what?\n\n01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:06.560\nYeah.\n\n01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:14.560\nIt basically, as, as I understand it, your gallbladder like processes fat and that kind\n\n01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.560\nof shit.\n\n01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:18.560\nAnd so, uh, normally they're like, Oh, we can just take your gallbladder out and your\n\n01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.560\nliver will take care of it and it will be fine.\n\n01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.560\nOh, you know what?\n\n01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.560\nI'm getting it mixed up with the goddamn appendix.\n\n01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:24.560\nOh no.\n\n01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:25.560\nYeah.\n\n01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.560\nAnd I was doing the, I was like, what the fuck?\n\n01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:31.560\nThe appendix, the appendix is like this thing.\n\n01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.560\nIt's like vestigial.\n\n01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.560\nAnd then it hurts.\n\n01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.560\nSome people, it's just hurting and you just, we'll get that fucker out of there.\n\n01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.560\nGallbladder.\n\n01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:39.560\nOkay.\n\n01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:45.560\nSo you, how many do you have before you get a gallectomy?\n\n01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:46.560\nOne.\n\n01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.560\nOne.\n\n01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.560\nSo it's like your liver or your heart.\n\n01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.560\nRight.\n\n01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.560\nIn that it's a one.\n\n01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.560\nIt's a oneer.\n\n01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:52.560\nIt's not an open surgery.\n\n01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:56.560\nIt's like four holes in my body right now and they sort of like it's here and they got,\n\n01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:01.560\nI swear to God, they like basically guide it down and pull it out of your belly button.\n\n01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:05.560\nThey pull the whole organ out, but they don't actually cut you open and go in there.\n\n01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.560\nWhat are you showing me?\n\n01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.560\nThat's my, that's a hole in my belly button.\n\n01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.560\nOkay.\n\n01:32:10.560

for the most part.\n\n01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.560\nI'm from New Jersey.\n\n01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.560\nIn Los Angeles, the city means, in Los Angeles, the city means something went

01:34:57.560\nYeah.\n\n01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:58.560\nThere's a Hooverville.\n\n01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.560\nThat's a real Hooverville.\n\n01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.560\nAll right.\n\n01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:02.560\nYeah.\n\n01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.560\nWell, okay.\n\n01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.560\nSo they suck it.\n\n01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.560\nSo you're saying they can remove, they remove the gallbladder.\n\n01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.560\nThis is what I don't understand.\n\n01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:10.560\nI can, I can understand.\n\n01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.560\nIt's a robot.\n\n01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:17.560\nThey use a little claws to go inside and like, yeah, two of the, so the smaller ones.\n\n01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.560\nI should have found this all out before.\n\n01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:24.560\nThey put like the tools inside and they, they kind of maneuvered out and then they suck\n\n01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.560\nit out.\n\n01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:29.560\nI thought it was through the bigger scar, not the belly button, but maybe your surgeon\n\n01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.560\ndid it differently.\n\n01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.560\nBut what about the duct work?\n\n01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.060\nThat's what I don't understand is when you remove something, you have to like deal with\n\n01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:40.560\nthe tubes going in and out and you're saying like, there's a robot being put in there.\n\n01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:47.560\nLike the robot goes in the, in the, in the body and the robot's like in there stitching.\n\n01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.560\nIt's sent to you.\n\n01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.560\nIt goes inside.\n\n01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.560\nJesus Christ, man.\n\n01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.560\nYeah.\n\n01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.560\nWe're going to, you're going to live forever.\n\n01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.560\nProbably.\n\n01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:56.560\nYou kids.\n\n01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:57.560\nWell, actually, I don't know.\n\n01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.060\nYour surgery was pretty recent.\n\n01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.560\nIf not, he can just replace me.\n\n01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.560\nOh, no.\n\n01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:09.560\nI mean, like they say the doctors told me that 90% of people feel no difference, but I totally\n\n01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.560\nexperienced like certain digestive kinks.\n\n01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.560\nSo just be aware.\n\n01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:17.560\nLike if, like if you see stuff that makes you want to puke, you're, you're, you're kind\n\n01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:19.560\nof like, ah, it's all right.\n\n01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:20.560\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.560\nIt's more actually like fatty food, like fried chicken.\n\n01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.560\nYeah.\n\n01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:27.060\nAlso like Dan, I know you mentioned once that like when you poop, it's usually after you\n\n01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:28.060\neat.\n\n01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:29.560\nIt's kind of like one in one out, like a club or something.\n\n01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:35.060\nI've, I wasn't like that before, but now after I eat, if I walk around, which you do a lot\n\n01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:36.060\nin.\n\n01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:37.060\nI've always been like that.\n\n01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:38.560\nI've always been the same way.\n\n01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.560\nIt's been random.\n\n01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.560\nIf anything, now I'm constipated, but it's because of the percocet.\n\n01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.560\nI poop like clockwork after I eat.\n\n01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:50.560\nLike I eat, I, I, I believe that I'm a, like a reverse pes dispenser, like that I, that\n\n01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:57.360\nI take a bite of a burger, there's a poop, the size of a bite of a burger that needs\n\n01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:58.360\nto come out of my butt.\n\n01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360\nThat's how I experienced.\n\n01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.960\nI was at work and there's this halal card across the street.\n\n01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:05.360\nSo I often go to the halal card one time that gave me a lot of extra shit.\n\n01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.360\nUh, so, so I was eating it and like as I was eating it, I was like, oh, I'm going to go.\n\n01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.860\nSo I'm at work and I went and I pooped and I came back out.\n\n01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:13.860\nI work in a very small office.\n\n01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:15.360\nI kept eating and then I had to poop again.\n\n01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.860\nAnd then there was a third time and I was like, something's got to give.\n\n01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:23.360\nI didn't want to be the guy who gets up and poops at least three times a day within like\n\n01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.360\nan hour.\n\n01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:29.060\nSo I just told my boss I wasn't feeling well and I went home and I took a three day\n\n01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:30.560\nweekend because I was embarrassed.\n\n01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.560\nAnd you know what?\n\n01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:34.560\nThere's no hashtag for us.\n\n01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.560\nThank you.\n\n01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:42.560\nNo one cares about, about white guys that have to poop all the time.\n\n01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.560\nThe fecal express.\n\n01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.060\nHashtag poopy problems.\n\n01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:48.560\nI met porn stars today.\n\n01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.560\nOkay.\n\n01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.560\nYou were telling us why your date was interesting and I was like, you got a gold letter.\n\n01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.560\nI don't want to steal your thunder.\n\n01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.560\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:57.560\nBig fan.\n\n01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:58.560\nWhat was your name again?\n\n01:37:58.560 --> 01:37:59.560\nAlex.\n\n01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:00.560\nAlex.\n\n01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:01.560\nThat's my middle name.\n\n01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:02.560\nAlex.\n\n01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.560\nAnd there's no way for you guys to touch the points of your gold letter.\n\n01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.560\nNothing would happen.\n\n01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:07.560\nNothing would happen anyway.\n\n01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.560\nDo you want to give it a try?\n\n01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:10.560\nNo.\n\n01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.560\nI mean, I mean, like if you touch them together.\n\n01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.560\nOh, wow.\n\n01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.560\nYours are fresh.\n\n01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.560\nYeah.\n\n01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.560\nNo, he's right.\n\n01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:16.560\nHe's, he's, he's, it's.\n\n01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.560\nThat's a health hazard.\n\n01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:18.560\nAnd I'm glad that you pointed that out.\n\n01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.560\nThat's crazy.\n\n01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.560\nYeah.\n\n01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:21.560\nPut some cocoa butter on it.\n\n01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:22.560\nThey're shiny.\n\n01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.560\nLike there's stuff on them.\n\n01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.560\nIt's not, it's not a judgment.\n\n01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:31.560\nLike they're both, they're clearly, they're, they're family.\n\n01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.560\nLike these two, they're, they're not, they're.\n\n01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560\nWait.\n\n01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:38.560\nThere's not a lot of support out there for younger people that have this.\n\n01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:42.560\nIt's a good, like these chat rooms and these subreddits and it's just all old people.\n\n01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.560\nAnd it makes you feel really, really small.\n\n01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.560\nI didn't mean to yawn into the mic.\n\n01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:56.560\nHey, um, hey, you've got some gall.\n\n01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.560\nIt's a miracle.\n\n01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.560\nRun fast, take chances everybody.\n\n01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.560\nWe, you know, we don't got a lot of time left and we owe something.\n\n01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:05.560\nOh, we do.\n\n01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.560\nOh shit.\n\n01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.560\nSo, um, I have, I had this idea.\n\n01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:15.560\nI know, you know, everyone's been wanting to play D&D, wants us to play D&D again.\n\n01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.560\nYeah.\n\n01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:19.560\nAll right.\n\n01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.560\nSo, um, I was thinking maybe we could play D&D.\n\n01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.560\nSo first we need characters, do you want to reprise Sharpie or do you want to just, um.\n\n01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560\nI'll be Sharpie of course.\n\n01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.560\nOkay.\n\n01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.560\nSo just, we're very short on time gentlemen.\n\n01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.560\nSo quickly you got to, who are your characters?\n\n01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:35.560\nWho do you want to be?\n\n01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:36.560\nWho do you want to be in you?\n\n01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:37.560\nLet's go you first,

she.\n\n01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.560\nSo I don't like brag about it, but I'm down.\n\n01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:14.560\nYou know what's up.\n\n01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.560\nPretty

player.\n\n01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:31.560\nAlright, you enter the village full of junk food, but all you want to do is snack.\n\n01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.560\nMake a will save.\n\n01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:41.560\nOh, you can't resist the temptation of all this junk food.\n\n01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.560\nCome on, you eat the junk food.\n\n01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:48.560\nI try to eat the junk food because it seems to be the only option.\n\n01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:49.560\nYeah.\n\n01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:52.560\nNo, I have to go to the field first, I have to roll a spliff,\n\n01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:56.560\nand I have to work up that appetite to get to the junk food, so I'm going to go and smoke first.\n\n01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.560\nOkay.\n\n01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.560\nYou're going out, you're going out to smoke and you see an old man.\n\n01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:06.560\nHe says, start snacking healthy with Nature Box.\n\n01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:15.560\nSo, I think it's, let's put it at Quark's turn.\n\n01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.560\nSorry, what?\n\n01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:22.560\nYou're eating junk food in the junk food village.\n\n01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.560\nOkay.\n\n01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:24.560\nWhat was the name again?\n\n01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.560\nDiem.\n\n01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:28.560\nDiem has just gone off to roll a spliff.\n\n01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.560\nOkay.\n\n01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:33.560\nI kind of want to stick around for the junk food, it's been a while since I could eat it.\n\n01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.560\nI don't want to take some imaginary junk food.\n\n01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:36.560\nAll right.\n\n01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:39.560\nWell, as you're eating that, an old man, the same old man, you wouldn't know that,\n\n01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:44.560\nan old man comes up and says, Nature Box makes snacks that actually taste great\n\n01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:49.560\nand are better for you,

binary.\n\n01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:17.600\nWell.\n\n01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.560\nSure.\n\n01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.760\nDo you have the fart?\n\n01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:28.400\nI know, I'm not, it would be a bad time to play, I don't think.\n\n01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.760\nOr really, once I saw you feeling like your gender,\n\n01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:34.920\nI was like, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.\n\n01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.760\nContinue.\n\n01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:37.840\nWhere was I now?\n\n01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:42.760\nYeah, no, it's figuring out about culture,\n\n01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.200\nthe very idea of gender is,\n\n01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.600\nwe've talked about this before,\n\n01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.640\nit's an emergent thing.\n\n01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.800\nIt's something that really exists\n\n01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:54.760\nwithin some sort of a matrix, some sort of a culture.\n\n01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:57.760\nAnd it's manifesting something physical.\n\n01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:59.840\nThe fact that we have done,\n\n01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.960\nthat there's a binary on the sexual,\n\n01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:04.160\nthere's a binary on this does that to that,\n\n01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:05.280\nand out comes that.\n\n01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.120\nTrying to always overlay that in some sort of comfort,\n\n01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.160\nin some sort of power structure,\n\n01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:13.720\nand let's simplify things,\n\n01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:15.560\nwell that does that,\n\n01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.000\nso we're gonna call those those people,\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.960\nand they tend to do that sort of thing.\n\n01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:21.200\nJust stepping back from all of that,\n\n01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:23.920\nand saying it doesn't have to be that way,\n\n01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.400\nbut it's going to be a pain,\n\n01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:27.400\nbecause it's going to be getting outside of the system,\n\n01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:28.480\nit's gonna be getting outside of it,\n\n01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.000\nit's gonna cause more energy.\n\n01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.440\nYou never get to feel like the good person,\n\n01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.600\nlike the hero of the story,\n\n01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:36.480\nwhen you're disrupting.\n\n01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:40.600\nLike not, there's a very few circumstances where that's,\n\n01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.480\nand we see everybody flock to that,\n\n01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.920\nwhen it's a matter of everybody just getting behind something,\n\n01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:47.160\nand hashtagging something, it's like, oh it's fun,\n\n01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:49.440\nlike why not, there's a tree there,\n\n01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:52.960\nlike it's standing, why shouldn't it be knocked over?\n\n01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:53.800\nLike, oh I-\n\n01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.560\nHey, remember when I said we had very little time left?\n\n01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:00.600\nBut he said that we, it wasn't quite as hard of an out.\n\n01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.120\nYeah, he did say that, yeah.\n\n01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:04.200\nHe did say that.\n\n01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:06.720\nWould you characterize Spencer what you're doing right now\n\n01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:07.880\nas transphobic?\n\n01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:08.720\nYes.\n\n01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.680\nAnd it's time to transform this phobic\n\n01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:14.520\ninto the end of the show.\n\n01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:17.160\nI'm Barclay Plein, NPR News.\n\n01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.480\nAll right.\n\n01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:19.320\nWoo!\n\n01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.560\nThat's been our show everybody!\n\n01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:25.880\nThank you to Marley, thank you to Stephanie,\n\n01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:28.080\nthank you to Jared, thank you to Alex,\n\n01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.120\nI'm so sorry to Jane.\n\n01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:32.960\nI really, I don't know, they're flashing lights at me,\n\n01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:33.800\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:35.000\nThanks for everyone's comfort,\n\n01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.320\nHarmontown, Harmontown's out of session!\n\n01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.960\nDrive fast, take chances!\n\n01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:57.400\nThank you so much!\n\n01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:59.880\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:10.440\nIt's a good show!\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[156488]}
