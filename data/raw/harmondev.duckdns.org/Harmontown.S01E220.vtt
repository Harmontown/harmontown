11:21.000 --> 11:37.600
Ladies and gentlemen of whatever borough this is, welcome to Harmontown, which is now

11:37.600 --> 11:48.000
in session.

11:48.000 --> 11:58.000
Please welcome Spencer Crittenden to the stage.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
What up?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.800
Oh, fuck.

12:00.800 --> 12:07.240
You know, that's such a good applause, I'm only gonna betray that confidence in me.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.840
See that exact, that laugh is exactly what I'm talking about, get ready for that the

12:10.840 --> 12:11.840
whole night.

12:11.840 --> 12:31.960
And the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

12:31.960 --> 12:32.960
Thank you New York.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.080
I love you so much the second time.

12:35.080 --> 12:38.400
The first show was kind of a trial run.

12:38.400 --> 12:45.720
If you were at that show, and you're also at this one, it's just twice as expensive

12:45.720 --> 12:48.720
for like the real show.

12:48.720 --> 12:54.400
If you were at that show and you're not at this one, like, I'm not saying anything that

12:54.400 --> 12:56.760
makes us legally accountable to you.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.920
You can't get a refund.

12:58.920 --> 13:05.800
I'm saying legally it was a good show last night, like I'm leaving a paper trail that

13:05.800 --> 13:16.480
I considered that a good show worth $25 plus a $10 seating fee, but I'm saying to you people,

13:16.480 --> 13:18.680
you're in for a much better show.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.800
Oh, big time.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.480
We got guests.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.000
Donald Trump is here everybody.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.440
Donald Trump is here.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.440
We're also tired.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.440
We're also raw.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.680
We're also sad.

13:32.680 --> 13:39.760
I speak, one of the silver linings of the things that I talked about already is like

13:39.760 --> 13:40.760
the world.

13:40.760 --> 13:46.760
We're also fucking scared that actually normal Republicans are talking to like Democrats

13:46.760 --> 13:53.160
and stuff and saying like, look, all I ever wanted was to make money.

13:53.160 --> 13:58.360
There's some honesty getting squeezed out of this zit of an election.

13:58.360 --> 14:03.800
And I don't know what to tell you kids because I guess actually we're talking to people.

14:03.800 --> 14:08.840
Most of the people that we're talking to will already have voted or not voted and the election

14:08.840 --> 14:09.840
is over.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.840
Right, especially once it's dropped.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.440
Because the podcast is on Wednesday.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.560
So I'm only talking to a room full of people before the election.

14:16.560 --> 14:22.840
Everyone else is like, whatever you're talking about doesn't matter anymore.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.920
And we're only 300 people, so we don't matter.

14:25.920 --> 14:31.120
And we're in a certain state, in a certain jurisdiction, and nothing matters.

14:31.120 --> 14:36.280
Like, kids.

14:36.280 --> 14:44.520
I would say if you live in a swing state, I'm not talking to anyone in a swing state.

14:44.520 --> 14:45.520
It's too late for me to tell anything.

14:45.520 --> 14:50.600
If you live in a swing state, either good job or what the fuck.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.080
Yeah, it's all over already.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.680
We're actually living in a time bubble.

14:56.680 --> 15:00.280
We're living in the future because nothing we do matters.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.520
Nothing we do will change the election, which hasn't happened yet.

15:03.520 --> 15:07.640
But as far as we're concerned, it already happened.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.640
That's kind of weird.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.640
We live in the future right now.

15:09.640 --> 15:15.320
So let's open the imaginary door in one of two scenarios.

15:15.320 --> 15:24.280
In one scenario, in a predictable election, we now have the first woman president and

15:24.280 --> 15:28.240
it's a Democrat.

15:28.240 --> 15:36.360
And we've therefore aggravated a frothy, frothy, like, white nationalist population

15:36.360 --> 15:43.920
who are not, that's their dream result, they're going to function a lot better if there's

15:43.920 --> 15:50.640
a race-trader lady in the White House and their only job is complaining.

15:50.640 --> 15:54.440
That's going to be their gas rent.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.440
They love that.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.960
They're not dreaming of Capitol Hill.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.960
They're not dreaming of that.

16:01.960 --> 16:07.160
If you're right now a white nationalist, you're probably, I don't know how to chart your weekly

16:07.160 --> 16:10.880
income, but it's got to be spiking right now.

16:10.880 --> 16:17.560
In the form of combat boot fees, I don't know how they make their money, but you know they're

16:17.560 --> 16:21.120
making three times as much right now as they ever have.

16:21.120 --> 16:29.440
And that would end if you did elect Hitler, because then he'd be like, so I love being

16:29.440 --> 16:33.600
president and then they'd be like, what's up with that Hitler stuff, come on, let's

16:33.600 --> 16:34.600
do that Hitler stuff.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.600
He'd be like, I can't do it.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.080
It's going to be huge when I do it.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.240
And they're going to be like, this guy's a bad Hitler.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.800
He's bad at being Hitler.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.040
And he's going to be like, yeah, I'm bad at everything.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.600
That's always been the fucking bit, you mooks.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.200
I'm the fucking son of a slumlord.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.480
It's hilarious that I'm standing here and you can't change that.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.320
I fucking win.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.640
I win when I lose.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.240
I win when I win.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.240
I have hair.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.920
I don't have hair.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.200
I'm white, but I'm orange.

17:06.200 --> 17:12.560
I fucking like, we're going to remember him as a hero 40 years from now when we're like

17:12.560 --> 17:20.760
rowing space boats away from a planet that just burnt to a cinder whether anyone was

17:20.760 --> 17:22.640
president or not.

17:22.640 --> 17:28.200
Just fucking burnt up because of a fucking like fireball from the sun or something.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.480
Oh fuck.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.480
Can that happen?

17:31.480 --> 17:32.760
Does the sun shoot fireballs?

17:32.760 --> 17:33.760
I'm asking you.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.760
Oh yeah.

17:34.760 --> 17:35.760
That can happen.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.760
That can happen.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.760
Fireballs.

17:37.760 --> 17:41.760
It's called a solar flare ball.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.760
Event.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.760
Wait.

17:43.760 --> 17:44.760
Well.

17:44.760 --> 17:45.760
You.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.760
Sorry.

17:46.760 --> 17:56.320
Spencer has been hanging out more than he has hung out.

17:56.320 --> 18:02.840
And you had a conversation at some point in a van or something.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.000
It was in a white van.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
It wasn't.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
You said.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.960
You're on the way to an undisclosed location.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.360
There's a phrase, sexual innuendo.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.360
Yes.

18:12.360 --> 18:16.400
Are you a little for the folks at home?

18:16.400 --> 18:19.360
What is sexual innuendo?

18:19.360 --> 18:26.360
Sexual innuendo is when you're not saying penis, but you mean penis.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.040
Like I'd like to handle that gear shift or something.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.040
Right.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.040
See if I say like, I'm going to.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.040
I'm sorry.

18:32.040 --> 18:36.040
I'm going to wax the flagpole if you know what I mean.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.040
Right.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.320
And then the person says, I do know what you mean.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.040
You mean you're going to go stroke your.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.040
Jerk it.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.960
And that was innuendo.

18:43.960 --> 18:49.760
And then if you say no, that was innuendo.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.360
That's meta innuendo.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.360
And you.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.040
But it's also a pun, right?

18:55.040 --> 18:56.040
It's a.

18:56.040 --> 18:57.040
It's mostly a pun.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.040
It's fan service is what it is.

18:59.040 --> 19:04.000
It'll, it'll, it'll, it'll, it'll not win an Emmy, but it'll keep you, it'll keep

19:04.000 --> 19:07.040
you squeaking by.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.240
You'll be, you'll be flesh and signature appointments.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.840
You'll be like, oh man, I never mind.

19:12.840 --> 19:13.840
I can't.

19:13.840 --> 19:14.840
Yeah, I can't talk about that.

19:14.840 --> 19:15.840
Okay.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.840
Don't, don't say that.

19:16.840 --> 19:17.840
Don't say, don't say stuff.

19:17.840 --> 19:18.840
You can't talk about that.

19:18.840 --> 19:19.840
That's, that's horrible.

19:19.840 --> 19:24.360
That's like crazy to say to people innuendo.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.360
Always sexual.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.360
All right.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.360
To in today's world.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.360
It's supposed to be.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.360
It is.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.240
Like we say, we have the phrase sexual innuendo because not all innuendo is sexual.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.240
Right.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.480
Only sexual innuendo is, but, but, but there isn't.

19:37.480 --> 19:43.040
And so Spencer said last night, we need to bring back non-sexual innuendo.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.040
Yeah.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.040
It's fun.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.360
I thought that would be a great goal.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.360
I don't know.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.480
I don't, I don't have anything else to do tonight.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.400
So I thought we could bring back non-sexual innuendo.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.400
Right.

19:53.400 --> 20:02.640
So like if I were to say, uh, hey, um, tomorrow night I'm gonna, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

20:02.640 --> 20:05.440
sharpen a pencil if you know what I mean.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.440
Right.

20:06.440 --> 20:11.640
But you're like, I will, if proper innuendo, I don't think you want to be saying if, if

20:11.640 --> 20:12.640
you know what I mean.

20:12.640 --> 20:13.640
Right.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.640
Oh no.

20:14.640 --> 20:15.640
Okay.

20:15.640 --> 20:16.840
Because innuendo, it's about doublespeak.

20:16.840 --> 20:21.760
It's about hiding the true intention of what you're saying so that uninitiative parties

20:21.760 --> 20:24.600
don't know that you're talking about what you're talking about and think you're just

20:24.600 --> 20:27.680
talking about bread or pigeons or something.

20:27.680 --> 20:31.520
So like, I don't know, like here's, this is me complaining about something.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.520
Um, okay.

20:32.520 --> 20:42.080
So I can't stand how burnt my buns are getting with all these bread lines being so, uh, close.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.080
You see?

20:43.080 --> 20:46.160
That's just me talking about bread to you people.

20:46.160 --> 20:50.160
You couldn't possibly imagine I was meaning other things by that sentence because that's

20:50.160 --> 20:54.880
just normal bread people talk, but I was really complaining about something.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.800
I know you mean like, let the fourth rake begin.

20:57.800 --> 20:58.800
Right.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.400
I know that and you know that, but they don't know that.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.480
And that's why it's great.

21:03.480 --> 21:09.400
And that's why we need to bring it back to hide our white nationalist tendencies.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.280
So whatever happens on Tuesday, uh, is it still Tuesday?

21:13.280 --> 21:14.280
Sure.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.320
I mean, it'll probably go until like Wednesday or something.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.320
Can we push it?

21:17.320 --> 21:19.720
Uh, the, I just, just remember, okay.

21:19.720 --> 21:26.200
So this time around, no matter what happens, like we're all abused children.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.520
We live in a home.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.120
I don't care if you're conservative or whatever.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.200
Like you all agree with everybody.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.400
We have a hundred percent agreement on this.

21:34.400 --> 21:39.760
The last year and a half has been an abusive relationship between us and the people that

21:39.760 --> 21:41.400
would tell us what to do.

21:41.400 --> 21:45.000
Like, and we have been, we have felt fed up about it.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.280
We have been like raked over shit when we have better stuff to do.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.440
We're not politicians.

21:51.440 --> 21:55.200
We shouldn't have to think about their job this much.

21:55.200 --> 22:00.800
And we like, like, like we are, we're all bummed out and, and, and every, every moment

22:00.800 --> 22:04.080
that you would think the solution would be to not care.

22:04.080 --> 22:10.000
Someone says the word abortion or women or race or like anything that like triggers you

22:10.000 --> 22:13.480
and goes like, well, they're talking about important shit.

22:13.480 --> 22:17.080
I, yeah, they're, they're always going to be, and they, they got to me and they got

22:17.080 --> 22:18.080
to you.

22:18.080 --> 22:23.080
And we, we're now here on the eve of like, it's, it's something's going to give.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.920
We're all going to stop having to fucking think about it for a while.

22:26.920 --> 22:32.640
Like we have to spend that four years, like whatever these dumbass house of representatives

22:32.640 --> 22:36.880
are that we're always hearing about, like, oh, they own the, we kind of start getting

22:36.880 --> 22:39.840
third party candidates into those seats.

22:39.840 --> 22:45.200
Like, like, I, I would, that, that's my weird pitch is like, let's just start, let's, let's

22:45.200 --> 22:48.560
have the historic election and go, yay, we did it.

22:48.560 --> 22:54.560
And then be like, okay, now the next, like weird election that comes up, if we believe

22:54.560 --> 22:58.800
in this system, then we'll go like, I don't, if you say that you're a Republican or Democrat,

22:58.800 --> 22:59.800
that's a red flag.

22:59.800 --> 23:04.760
Like, like you're, because you're part of a bad fucking weird, good cop, bad cop, alcoholic

23:04.760 --> 23:10.920
husband system, where it's like this syndrome of like black eye and then apology and black

23:10.920 --> 23:11.920
eye and then apology.

23:11.920 --> 23:16.000
And it's like, like, it's not fucking working with given it 60 years, they built this shit

23:16.000 --> 23:17.080
on top of something.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.080
It's made of two legs.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.240
So you think it's two things, but it's an animal.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.240
All right.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.240
All right.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.240
That's it.

23:23.240 --> 23:24.740
That ends the political segment, because now we don't have to worry about it anymore.

23:24.740 --> 23:28.120
Because it's fucking, we, we walk out of here and into a world where it already happened.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.120
It's over.

23:29.120 --> 23:33.440
And you're going to find out, like that office is so insignificant, Hitler could be in it

23:33.440 --> 23:35.800
and nothing would still happen.

23:35.800 --> 23:39.240
He'd be like, I want to close Guantanamo or make it twice as big.

23:39.240 --> 23:43.600
And it would just be like Guantanamo still be there and the same size, like four years

23:43.600 --> 23:48.240
from now, Hitler will be like, I, that should be filled with Jews and like a million times

23:48.240 --> 23:49.240
the size.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.840
And it will, but it'll be caught up in red tape.

23:51.840 --> 23:58.120
It just, we can take comfort in our catch cradle of fucking, we're fine, we'll be fine

23:58.120 --> 24:00.120
for a while.

24:00.120 --> 24:06.800
Pompey, last words at Pompey.

24:06.800 --> 24:07.800
We got a fine.

24:07.800 --> 24:08.800
It's a big mountain.

24:08.800 --> 24:13.880
There's some lava dribbling out by the time that becomes an issue, I think we'll have

24:13.880 --> 24:24.960
time to wake up and grab the kids and the boom, I'm catching a ball forever again in a museum

24:24.960 --> 24:30.520
in Milwaukee and a guy like the, like they make the molds and there's like a guy holding

24:30.520 --> 24:31.520
a guy up.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.520
Is that real?

24:32.520 --> 24:36.160
Well, you got like the Pompey things and then there's a guy with a knife and then there's

24:36.160 --> 24:38.200
a rich guy going like, here's my money.

24:38.200 --> 24:45.240
And he's like, he's like in the middle of being robbed and civilization, I don't know

24:45.240 --> 24:48.800
how to feel about that.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.240
But that's got to be fake, right?

24:50.240 --> 24:56.360
There's no such thing as an event that happens so fast that you can be mid-robing.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.040
Nothing has ever happened that quickly.

24:58.040 --> 25:01.880
I bet a nuclear bomb might do that, but it wouldn't leave anything, right?

25:01.880 --> 25:07.400
You'd hear a whistle of the bomb coming down and you'd be like this, like like Pompey should

25:07.400 --> 25:14.200
be, all of the Pompey molds should be, everybody going like, that's if it happened really fast.

25:14.200 --> 25:19.280
It should just be a bunch of people, maybe one guy's holding a knife and then you got

25:19.280 --> 25:21.720
like, I bet he was robbing him, that would be fun.

25:21.720 --> 25:27.120
But I don't believe that he, the guy's gone, stick him up.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.960
Like it's like a freeze ray hit him.

25:28.960 --> 25:29.960
Right.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.280
I don't know if I believe that.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.280
Yeah.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.280
I'd like to believe that.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.280
That's like a guillotine.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.920
They say the guillotine is the most humane way of execution.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.520
No one can, no one can test this.

25:38.520 --> 25:43.480
You can't, you can't survey severed heads versus people that got lethal injection.

25:43.480 --> 25:47.880
But they say the guillotine is the most humane way to kill somebody.

25:47.880 --> 25:53.200
According to my 10th grade history teacher, who, who must be right about everything because

25:53.200 --> 26:01.520
he was in Korea during the war and he also would constantly accidentally smoke his chalk.

26:01.520 --> 26:09.400
So I believe everything he says and he said, all you feel is a cold, a cold, just a cold

26:09.400 --> 26:11.320
sensation in the back of your neck.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.320
He doesn't know.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.320
Blissful darkness.

26:13.320 --> 26:14.320
Yeah.

26:14.320 --> 26:18.200
Did he, did he mention the least humane way to execute somebody?

26:18.200 --> 26:19.200
No.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.200
Oh.

26:20.200 --> 26:25.000
What do you think, what, I, I, I, I'd like to challenge you to come up with it.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
All right.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Okay.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Okay.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Um.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
The least humane way.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
All right.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
So.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Definitely just.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.360
You get a bunch of fire ants and then you give them knives.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.200
Chinese fire ant sized knives.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.520
Yeah.

26:39.520 --> 26:43.040
Just let nature take its course.

26:43.040 --> 26:47.280
I say humiliate them to death.

26:47.280 --> 26:55.480
Keep them fed and watered and immortal and like make them have to die of shame.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.480
Okay.

26:56.480 --> 27:02.480
Well, that's, that's very conceptual, but what does that, what does that look like?

27:02.480 --> 27:03.480
What does it look like?

27:03.480 --> 27:04.480
Yeah.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.480
Well, how do you humiliate it?

27:05.480 --> 27:09.720
It looks like a standard harness in a, in a windowless room with tubes going into them

27:09.720 --> 27:12.760
that give them nutrients and liquid.

27:12.760 --> 27:13.760
And then.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.760
Humiliation is happening.

27:14.760 --> 27:15.760
No.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.760
What's the humility?

27:16.760 --> 27:17.760
Like is it people laughing?

27:17.760 --> 27:19.760
Is he like getting his dick slapped or something?

27:19.760 --> 27:25.360
Like no one wants to be seen with their dick being slapped in public, right?

27:25.360 --> 27:29.600
You come into the room and you say, uh, hi, how are you?

27:29.600 --> 27:33.200
And then you leave and then you do that 40 times.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.200
Right.

27:34.200 --> 27:38.160
And then the third, the 41st time you say, hi, how are you?

27:38.160 --> 27:41.920
But you said I was going to leave anyways.

27:41.920 --> 27:47.880
That's just one example of how you'll never know what the fuck is going on.

27:47.880 --> 27:53.400
I'm going to tell you some shit, not because you'll, you ever have the right to know and

27:53.400 --> 27:58.320
not because it profits me, but because it will make your torture more exquisite.

27:58.320 --> 28:03.000
I'm telling you, you're part of an experiment where we're seeing if we can humiliate a person

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
to death.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.720
That's how significant you are.

28:05.720 --> 28:10.320
You're interesting, but you don't matter.

28:10.320 --> 28:14.800
If we don't humiliate you to death, I guess he'll die of gangrene or anything else that

28:14.800 --> 28:16.720
would kill you.

28:16.720 --> 28:21.080
But if we humiliate you to death, it will be no different.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.080
It won't matter.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.080
It won't matter.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.080
You don't matter.

28:24.080 --> 28:28.080
And then I'd leave and then I'd keep coming back and I just like some days I'd come back

28:28.080 --> 28:35.160
with a soda, like a Diet Coke and I'd just, and then I'd leave.

28:35.160 --> 28:43.360
What does humiliation mean to you?

28:43.360 --> 28:45.360
To cause humility.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.360
Right.

28:46.360 --> 28:49.720
And humility is when two people are talking to each other.

28:49.720 --> 28:56.760
No, humility is when one person being talked to feels like they don't mean very much.

28:56.760 --> 28:57.760
Right.

28:57.760 --> 29:00.680
But they mean enough that someone's spending their entire life.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.760
I would nip that in the bud.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.880
I would say to the guy, by the way, we're

29:04.880 --> 29:07.400
probably doing this to 700 people.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.240
Well, you'd have to get different people.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.680
It couldn't be you because you'd be like, man, you need to get a life, man.

29:12.680 --> 29:16.120
No, but I would nip what you're talking about in the bud because you're getting to a thing.

29:16.120 --> 29:19.040
That's what all the Twitter people go when they go, Dan, you're fat and you're untalented

29:19.040 --> 29:20.040
and who cares.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.040
Of course.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.040
And then I go, fuck you.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.040
And then they go, fuck me, fuck you.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.480
And I go, fuck you, kid, fuck you.

29:26.480 --> 29:28.480
And then the kid's like, fuck you, fuck you.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.880
Nice to see you're fat and chubby chasing.

29:30.880 --> 29:31.880
Fat, fat.

29:31.880 --> 29:37.520
And I'm like, hey, kid, listen to me, fuck you.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.320
Nothing's changing.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.160
You got to open up.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.160
Nothing's changing.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.240
Well, something's changing.

29:44.240 --> 29:51.400
This is where the kid always goes, you're paying attention to me, that's one thing.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.960
That's the worst thing in the world.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.360
You're fucking, that's so sad.

29:56.360 --> 29:59.320
Like what, we live in a society where attention is currency.

29:59.320 --> 30:00.320
It's also.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.960
The attention of criminals, like you fucking, like, handcuff, that's the problem.

30:03.960 --> 30:09.760
But your attention is delivered to you electronically instantly with a system that notifies you.

30:09.760 --> 30:13.080
This country was founded on the idea that being left alone was a luxury.

30:13.080 --> 30:17.760
Like, if people were like, like noticing you, it was like, fuck you, don't notice me.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.040
I got a right to be fucking obscure.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.240
Like, it's called the pursuit of happiness.

30:22.240 --> 30:25.960
And then like, we invented cameras and it's like, oh, Jerry Springer can save my marriage

30:25.960 --> 30:34.080
and like, fame means something, fame is important because it's like, if you had, if you had

30:34.080 --> 30:39.320
a big pile of dollars in your hand, like, and they all set a thousand on them.

30:39.320 --> 30:44.040
So you're like, you're walking around this big pile of dollar cake.

30:44.040 --> 30:50.240
Like then everybody around you knows, well, that person has like something, I could use

30:50.240 --> 30:54.760
that to buy food, I could get shelter with that, I could get whatever I want, because

30:54.760 --> 30:58.800
it's like, that's capitalism, this, this is shit that will get you anything.

30:58.800 --> 31:03.480
So like those people then go, well, why don't I just beat him up and take this?

31:03.480 --> 31:07.720
The answer is because there's nine dudes standing around me who are like wearing sunglasses

31:07.720 --> 31:12.480
because I have so much of this that they all have some and like, why don't they kill me?

31:12.480 --> 31:16.360
Well, they don't kill me because if they do, like, they'll just like, there's another

31:16.360 --> 31:18.120
ring outward and outward.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.480
So that's the whole system.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.680
What was my point?

31:21.680 --> 31:22.840
We want to be left alone.

31:22.840 --> 31:23.840
Oh.

31:23.840 --> 31:27.680
Well, people make this mistake because people because the money came because these people

31:27.680 --> 31:33.240
at one point, they started going like, OK, let's make a let's let's let's sell everybody

31:33.240 --> 31:36.880
just nothing like, like, let's just sell them stories and things so you make television

31:36.880 --> 31:37.880
and movies.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.520
And then people go like, oh, look at Iron Man.

31:39.520 --> 31:44.080
He serves ironing today and like, here's my money and then they go, like, thank you

31:44.080 --> 31:45.080
for the money.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.600
And it's like, like, we're making money off of like, like, like telling you stuff.

31:48.600 --> 31:52.360
And then the guy on the screen, that guy's famous because you recognize him.

31:52.360 --> 31:55.640
Because he stopped at the grocery store, he'd be like, holy shit, Iron Man's buying milk,

31:55.640 --> 31:56.880
but he doesn't have to buy milk.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.440
He has a guy buy milk for him.

31:58.440 --> 32:03.480
That's makes it even more exciting to see him fame and seeing famous people.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.480
That's obscure.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.480
Holy shit.

32:05.480 --> 32:06.480
That's so and so over there.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.880
I'm never going to see this person ever again in my life.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.720
I may even hate him or love him.

32:11.720 --> 32:12.880
It doesn't even matter.

32:12.880 --> 32:16.760
I just can't leave this room without like something.

32:16.760 --> 32:21.800
And if I had that, then I'd also have money and power and all this stuff, but it's not

32:21.800 --> 32:22.800
true anymore.

32:22.800 --> 32:27.760
Like, so people tweet you and they go like, hey, fat fuck, what do you do in fat fuck?

32:27.760 --> 32:30.280
And then you go, hey, fuck you, pipsqueak.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.760
And they go, I won.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.680
But then they're, it doesn't help them at all.

32:34.680 --> 32:41.200
What they call a victory is the mechanic of Twitter functioning as planned.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.920
He tweets at you, you see the tweets.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.760
That's not, that's, that's Twitter.

32:45.760 --> 32:46.760
That's not a win.

32:46.760 --> 32:47.760
Yeah.

32:47.760 --> 32:50.560
It's like, it's like a, it's like a fucking amazing thing about technology.

32:50.560 --> 32:54.480
Like you shouldn't, you wouldn't like send it, take an X-ray of your broken leg with

32:54.480 --> 32:57.000
your phone and send it to your doctor.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.640
And when your doctor says it looks like you have a broken leg, you fucking loser.

33:01.640 --> 33:02.640
Yeah.

33:02.640 --> 33:12.080
Why are you, why are you looking at X-rays at home fucking faggot?

33:12.080 --> 33:13.080
That's faggot shit.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.080
Looking at X-rays.

33:14.080 --> 33:19.040
If I get self-employed at home doctor looking at X-rays.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.040
Yeah.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.040
That's the fascination with phones.

33:21.040 --> 33:27.280
Like when they come to you, they interest you.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.800
Broken leg winner.

33:28.800 --> 33:29.800
Oh man.

33:29.800 --> 33:30.800
Okay.

33:30.800 --> 33:34.280
I just had the, I had this idea, I should have mentioned it before.

33:34.280 --> 33:38.360
You know, when you, people have these mic drop moments, these spike the football moments.

33:38.360 --> 33:42.480
It sounds like I was about, you were about to do that before I cut you off.

33:42.480 --> 33:47.280
But like what you should do when you have that mic drop moment is you should do the

33:47.280 --> 33:52.360
NPR sign off like they do because you know, they always end with this awesome or they

33:52.360 --> 33:54.240
think it's an awesome line, but it's not.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.200
And then they spike the football with their name.

33:56.200 --> 34:01.000
They're like, it looks like these ballet shoes are in lockstep.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.080
I'm Marina Simons NPR News Brazil.

34:05.080 --> 34:17.240
So you just be like, hey Dan, are those pants brown or did your shit fall out of your pants?

34:17.240 --> 34:23.400
I'm Spencer Crittenden NPR News.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.520
I think we should start that.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.520
Is that your face or did your neck throw up from Washington?

34:28.520 --> 34:29.920
I'm Corey Flintoff.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.240
I just wanted to say Corey Flintoff.

34:32.240 --> 34:38.520
I was just, I was doing the same thing, but no, I just wanted to say Corey Flintoff.

34:38.520 --> 34:39.520
It's a good name.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.480
They're, they all have amazing names.

34:41.480 --> 34:45.280
That's part of what makes the sign off so powerful because it's not the sign off.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.600
You know, they're just saying dumb shit.

34:47.600 --> 34:51.040
I don't like, like, because most of the time they sound, when they say that, when they

34:51.040 --> 34:54.360
say their names, it really sounds like they're like, yeah, I really nailed it.

34:54.360 --> 34:59.840
But most of the time it's just really lackluster and it's like, it looks like autumn has come

34:59.840 --> 35:01.960
to town.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.720
I'm Corey Flintoff NPR.

35:03.720 --> 35:08.080
And like, it's just like, why, that's your, I don't know, he sounds so smug.

35:08.080 --> 35:11.880
Have you ever been listening to an NPR piece and they, they have that cadence and so you

35:11.880 --> 35:19.080
think it's going to end and then it doesn't, they go like, so, and that's, and that's when

35:19.080 --> 35:24.520
homelessness becomes something where the heart is.

35:24.520 --> 35:34.880
David walks to Dunkin' Donuts and you're like, yeah, I was ready to move on.

35:34.880 --> 35:41.840
Let's let's do, let's do a, let's do a segment called my friend, my friend needs a job.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.840
Because Marley, are you here?

35:42.840 --> 35:43.840
Can you come out on stage?

35:43.840 --> 35:44.840
Marley, Marley Nelson?

35:44.840 --> 35:45.840
It might take him a bit.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.240
I think he's in the audience.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.240
Okay.

35:48.240 --> 35:49.240
He can't clamber up the.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.760
He will, but it just might take a bit.

35:50.760 --> 35:51.760
Yeah.

35:51.760 --> 35:52.760
Or I hope he will.

35:52.760 --> 35:53.760
I don't want to speak for him.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.440
When he gets here, we're going to give him a job.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.440
I know what you're thinking.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.720
It's, it's, I came here to give.

36:00.720 --> 36:01.720
What can I give?

36:01.720 --> 36:04.640
I drove from Phoenix.

36:04.640 --> 36:13.480
I paid $35 and I want to engage in charity.

36:13.480 --> 36:19.600
Standing in line was my duty and now begins my obligation.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.080
That's what you're thinking.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.560
Isn't a duty an obligation?

36:24.560 --> 36:28.120
A duty, a duty is a necessity sometimes.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.760
Marley, everybody.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.760
All right.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.760
Hi Marley.

36:33.760 --> 36:45.200
All right, Marley, Marley, I met you because you, wait, are we, should we not say how I

36:45.200 --> 36:47.520
met you because is that, oh, fuck them, man.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.520
Yeah.

36:48.520 --> 36:49.520
Okay.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.520
Yeah.

36:50.520 --> 36:54.520
Well, I met you because you were working at the hotel I was staying at and you, you're,

36:54.520 --> 37:00.600
you're, you're, you're a, you're a very hospitable person and then, and then while I was gone

37:00.600 --> 37:05.160
at one point you got fired from the hotel because you weren't, I don't know what the

37:05.160 --> 37:06.160
story was.

37:06.160 --> 37:08.040
Well, the story was a little complicated.

37:08.040 --> 37:13.480
It was one person said this, another person said that, but essentially I kind of had sex

37:13.480 --> 37:16.080
upstairs and it was frowned upon.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.080
Right.

37:17.080 --> 37:20.760
Apparently you can't do that type of thing at work.

37:20.760 --> 37:25.680
In a hotel, when there's that, the only thing that is in a hotel is a bunch of empty beds.

37:25.680 --> 37:26.680
That's what I'm saying.

37:26.680 --> 37:30.080
If you work in a hotel and you're doing a good enough job.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.880
One plus one is two.

37:31.880 --> 37:40.640
That's what I mean, like, that's the first time you've ever told me that, by the way.

37:40.640 --> 37:47.360
I didn't bring him up because I knew the reason he got fired was awesome.

37:47.360 --> 37:51.960
He told me he wasn't at his post, but it sounds like you were.

37:51.960 --> 37:59.200
I had to keep it professional, you know, like, but I was posting though, it was, it was.

37:59.200 --> 38:04.720
All right, so, and you were, you know, you're, if you can make friends with me, it means

38:04.720 --> 38:14.080
you're, you're either black or, or you're a very friendly, like, or both.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.960
And if you're both, we're friends.

38:16.960 --> 38:21.720
And I, but, but no, but I like, you know, you're, you're, you seem like a good guy.

38:21.720 --> 38:27.000
I don't think that you're secretly a rapist or anything like I, I also, I don't think

38:27.000 --> 38:28.240
you're a secret murderer.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.960
I don't think you're a secret burglar.

38:29.960 --> 38:33.640
Oh, no, I'm actually really open and honest about my murdering, burglaring.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.600
So like, once I do it, you know, it's, it comes through.

38:36.600 --> 38:37.600
Yeah.

38:37.600 --> 38:38.600
All right.

38:38.600 --> 38:43.440
So what I talked to you earlier before the show and I got some data, like, as you put

38:43.440 --> 38:47.680
it, because you've tried, you were in the hospitality industry, which you were very good at.

38:47.680 --> 38:48.680
Yes.

38:48.680 --> 38:52.520
If I could, if I could start a hotel, I would have you at the front door, like, I would

38:52.520 --> 38:55.200
know that you were going to make every guest feel wonderful.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.200
Well, yeah, 100%.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.200
That's the job.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.200
Yeah.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.760
But you, you, you went from there to comic book distribution.

39:00.760 --> 39:01.760
Yes, it's true.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.600
And you're currently working in that.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.320
You're a big comic book fan.

39:05.320 --> 39:07.320
You like Iron Man, you like Spider-Man.

39:07.320 --> 39:08.320
What's your favorite?

39:08.320 --> 39:10.640
Oh, that's a complicated question, man.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.640
Oh, gosh.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.640
Yeah.

39:12.640 --> 39:13.640
Whoo.

39:13.640 --> 39:19.280
Uh, probably Dr. Doom and Batman would have to be like the, like, pinnacle of comic book

39:19.280 --> 39:20.280
doom.

39:20.280 --> 39:21.280
You like Dr. Doom.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.280
Yeah.

39:22.280 --> 39:27.160
Like a guy, you like, like his, you said earlier, you said, you said this election

39:27.160 --> 39:36.600
is like choosing between Dr. Doom and Red Skull, which means like an insidious, like,

39:36.600 --> 39:37.600
uh, yeah.

39:37.600 --> 39:38.600
Well, okay.

39:38.600 --> 39:39.600
Yeah.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.600
But you want to work with Dr. Doom because at the end of the day, he's going to take

39:41.600 --> 39:43.160
care of you.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.160
He's got a lot of varia.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.160
Yeah.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.160
Yeah.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.160
Exactly.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.160
You got a lot of varia and they're like, oh, we love doom.

39:48.160 --> 39:49.160
Yeah.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.160
We have universal healthcare.

39:50.160 --> 39:51.160
We got doom bots.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.160
We got doom bots.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.160
Yeah.

39:53.160 --> 39:54.160
Dr. Doom's a both board kind of guy.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.160
No, he absolutely is.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.560
He's like, I have a chrome face.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.560
I have a country.

39:57.560 --> 40:01.560
Some of it's under a hood, but that's because I don't want to look like Destro.

40:01.560 --> 40:08.560
Well, and, but, but Red Skull is like, I don't want to know, I have a red skull for

40:08.560 --> 40:09.560
a head.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.560
I'm going to, I'm going to hydra everything.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.560
The dude has a red skull like that.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.560
And he's not proud of it.

40:16.560 --> 40:17.560
No.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.560
Yeah.

40:18.560 --> 40:19.560
He's very upset.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.560
I don't think that Red Skull was his idea as a name.

40:20.560 --> 40:24.560
I think, I think he probably was like, I'm Warlock master.

40:24.560 --> 40:29.560
And then like eventually gave in like the way with the big league thing, big league became

40:29.560 --> 40:30.560
big league.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.560
Your skull's red.

40:31.560 --> 40:32.560
We should just stick with what we know.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.560
All right.

40:33.560 --> 40:37.160
So politics is disturbing the, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's muddying the waters here.

40:37.160 --> 40:40.160
It's like, it doesn't matter how you feel.

40:40.160 --> 40:47.280
What matters is you're, you tried hospitality, you're now working a comic book distribution.

40:47.280 --> 40:51.560
What you told me, if you had your ideal job, it would be getting high and talking about

40:51.560 --> 40:52.560
comics.

40:52.560 --> 40:53.560
All day.

40:53.560 --> 40:54.560
Yeah.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.560
So is there anybody in New York that is,

40:56.560 --> 40:57.560
Owns a comic book store.

40:57.560 --> 41:01.560
Has a business that involves someone along the pipeline getting high and talking about

41:01.560 --> 41:02.560
comic books.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.060
Smoking pot, talking about comic books guys.

41:04.060 --> 41:05.560
I can do this all day.

41:05.560 --> 41:08.560
Oh, Dustin owns a podcast network.

41:08.560 --> 41:09.560
Yeah.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.560
I guess you could get high and talk about it.

41:11.560 --> 41:12.560
Yeah.

41:12.560 --> 41:16.560
I mean, you, you would have to do ads while you got high and talk about comics.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.560
You'd have to like go.

41:17.560 --> 41:18.560
Or comics.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.560
Iron Man's dope.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.560
Or comics.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.560
And so is Dollar Shave Club.

41:21.560 --> 41:28.060
Like you'd have to, can you imagine like pitching like just comic book superheroes as if they

41:28.060 --> 41:29.560
were podcast ads?

41:29.560 --> 41:35.560
Like I've been reading Spider-Man for a long time and I got to tell you that it's 20%

41:35.560 --> 41:42.560
off and Spider-Man has webbing that entangles foes with ease and the strength of six men.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.560
I don't know.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.560
It would be great.

41:44.560 --> 41:47.560
I mean, maybe it wouldn't.

41:47.560 --> 41:54.560
All right, so, so people listening to this will know Marley, Marley Nelson.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.560
Marley Nelson on Facebook.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.560
He's a pot in comics.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.560
He's in New York.

41:59.560 --> 42:00.560
He needs.

42:00.560 --> 42:01.560
He.

42:01.560 --> 42:04.560
My mom is going to hear this shit, bro.

42:04.560 --> 42:05.560
Yeah.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.560
He's off the, he's off the map.

42:07.560 --> 42:08.560
Wait, what?

42:08.560 --> 42:09.560
I didn't even think about that.

42:09.560 --> 42:10.560
Wait, what is your mom going to hear it?

42:10.560 --> 42:11.560
I don't, I don't know.

42:11.560 --> 42:12.560
I'm, I'm.

42:12.560 --> 42:13.560
Oh, we could cut this out.

42:13.560 --> 42:18.560
Well, just tell your mom not to, your mom, your mom doesn't listen to my podcast.

42:18.560 --> 42:19.560
I don't know.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.560
She's your biggest fan.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.560
You're excited.

42:21.560 --> 42:25.560
You're conflicted because you wanted to tell your mom you were on a podcast and then you're

42:25.560 --> 42:27.560
like, Michelle, no, I get high.

42:27.560 --> 42:28.560
Yeah.

42:28.560 --> 42:31.560
Well, she like knows, but she doesn't want everyone else to know that she knows.

42:31.560 --> 42:33.560
Well, I just put that shit out.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.560
Well, we'll cut it out.

42:35.560 --> 42:36.560
It'll be fine.

42:36.560 --> 42:39.560
This relationship, you need, you, you own it, not her.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.560
Just don't tell her you were on a podcast.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.560
She's never going to find out.

42:43.560 --> 42:44.560
I hope not.

42:44.560 --> 42:46.560
My rent's going to be all fucked up.

42:46.560 --> 42:51.560
Nobody that, nobody that knows Martha Nelson from Greenwich Village is going to.

42:51.560 --> 42:53.560
How do you know that name?

42:53.560 --> 42:54.560
I love comic books.

42:54.560 --> 42:55.560
See that guys?

42:55.560 --> 42:57.560
That was Batman versus Superman.

42:57.560 --> 42:59.560
Oh shit.

42:59.560 --> 43:05.560
What, what, uh, what, uh, what, what do you, what do you, what do you think of this Bane

43:05.560 --> 43:07.560
guy in this Batman movie?

43:07.560 --> 43:11.560
And that third Batman movie, what did you think of that?

43:11.560 --> 43:12.560
Like for real?

43:12.560 --> 43:13.560
Oh yeah.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.560
Let's, let's talk about this.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.560
I have opinions too, but I want to hear yours.

43:17.560 --> 43:21.560
I mean, it was like, it wasn't, it wasn't Bane at all.

43:21.560 --> 43:22.560
No.

43:22.560 --> 43:23.560
I mean, like, I get what they were trying to do.

43:23.560 --> 43:24.560
Thank you.

43:24.560 --> 43:27.560
Because what I wanted to do was like crazy shit, but that wasn't fucking Bane, bro.

43:27.560 --> 43:31.560
Bane's a goddamn mercenary, has nothing to do with League of Assassin's, broke Batman's

43:31.560 --> 43:34.560
back, did that shit in the whole Nightfall storyline.

43:34.560 --> 43:35.560
It was like a whole fucking thing.

43:35.560 --> 43:36.560
Nah, that shit was all fucked up.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.560
Also, he's super smart, right?

43:38.560 --> 43:40.560
Like, like, he's a mastermind and that wasn't represented at all.

43:40.560 --> 43:44.560
He's a really good strategist, but he's not like, he's not like Batman level smart.

43:44.560 --> 43:45.560
Well, no one's Batman.

43:45.560 --> 43:46.560
Yeah, no one's Batman level.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.560
Well, maybe Brainy.

43:47.560 --> 43:53.560
I don't like, the movie begins with the idea that he, he's comfortable putting a hood on

43:53.560 --> 43:57.560
and he's getting on a plane and he's got this whole plan laid out because he apparently

43:57.560 --> 44:02.560
knows exactly what happens when you surrender to the federal government.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.560
Like, he knows, he's got a hood on his head.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.560
You know, when you hit it like that.

44:06.560 --> 44:11.560
And he's like, and he's like picking his quips and like, and it's like, oh, whoa, that depends.

44:11.560 --> 44:14.560
Are you afraid of me?

44:14.560 --> 44:16.560
Oh, I'm afraid of you.

44:16.560 --> 44:21.560
And it's like, and he's got this hood on and it's like, what if the fucking guy just pointed

44:21.560 --> 44:24.560
and blew his brains out like before he had the hood off?

44:24.560 --> 44:26.560
He doesn't know that's not going to happen.

44:26.560 --> 44:27.560
I don't admire that kind of villain.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.560
He doesn't plan things.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.560
Like, the Joker was it, okay, all right.

44:31.560 --> 44:34.560
It's just, it was just like, oh, the whole thing is like, oh, he's so logical.

44:34.560 --> 44:35.560
He got him right where he wants him.

44:35.560 --> 44:37.560
But it's like, there's no internal logic.

44:37.560 --> 44:38.560
I don't like it.

44:38.560 --> 44:41.560
I don't like lack of internal logic in my superhero.

44:41.560 --> 44:43.560
In the Joker or Bane?

44:43.560 --> 44:47.560
I mentioned the Joker for a second because it's like, they did a good job of creating a character

44:47.560 --> 44:52.560
that could be counted on to do anything other than what made sense because that was his superpower.

44:52.560 --> 44:55.560
Like, that was a cool Heath Ledger Joker.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.560
It was like, we all agree.

44:57.560 --> 44:59.560
Well, he was the best part of that movie.

44:59.560 --> 45:03.560
They made the Joker make sense in that way.

45:03.560 --> 45:06.560
He's a compulsive anarchist.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.560
He just wants to watch the world burn.

45:08.560 --> 45:11.560
It's kind of cheating, but fine, fuck it.

45:11.560 --> 45:15.560
But Bane was like, I've got a plan for Gotham.

45:15.560 --> 45:20.560
I'm going to make sure everyone finds out about the corruption.

45:20.560 --> 45:23.560
That's way better than the Bane that we had.

45:23.560 --> 45:29.560
To even say this causes me physical discomfort, but I'm going to say it because I love all of you.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.560
Batman and Robin.

45:31.560 --> 45:33.560
Right.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.560
What, the movie?

45:35.560 --> 45:36.560
Yeah, that movie.

45:36.560 --> 45:42.560
The Bane and that was just like, it was like a slap to the face of everything I've ever known in comic books.

45:42.560 --> 45:45.560
It was like, almost as bad as Spider-Man's organic weapon.

45:45.560 --> 45:56.560
I met Adam West at Stanley's Kamikaze, and it was very uncomfortable.

45:56.560 --> 45:57.560
Why?

45:57.560 --> 46:10.560
Because I told the comic con organizer, she said, I heard her going like, when Adam West gets here, blah, blah, blah, and I was like,

46:10.560 --> 46:18.560
Adam West here, I'd really like to meet him, and I didn't expect actually steps to be taken that involved putting anyone out.

46:18.560 --> 46:24.560
And then we went to meet Stan Lee, which turns out means that you...

46:24.560 --> 46:27.560
I kept thinking we were going to be brought into a room.

46:27.560 --> 46:32.560
It's like the old Greg Barrett's joke of the New York Times calls him and asks him a few questions,

46:32.560 --> 46:36.560
and he thinks that he's getting interviews, but they're just selling him a subscription.

46:36.560 --> 46:41.560
I thought Stan Lee wanted to meet me.

46:41.560 --> 46:45.560
Stan Lee would love to have you at his comic con and meet you, and I was like, of course he does.

46:45.560 --> 46:49.560
My time has come.

46:49.560 --> 46:53.560
He's got better shit to do.

46:53.560 --> 46:59.560
It was more like, oh, well, the comic con, you go in the front of the line, and then you meet Stan Lee, it was fine.

46:59.560 --> 47:08.560
But then they were like, we're walking from the comic con out to the van to leave, and this golf cart is speeding up,

47:08.560 --> 47:14.560
and the comic con organizer leaps into the path of it and flags it down because it's Adam West,

47:14.560 --> 47:17.560
and Dan Harmon wants to meet Adam West.

47:17.560 --> 47:22.560
And so Adam West is like, who?

47:22.560 --> 47:28.560
And Burt Ward, who's in the back seat, is like, double who?

47:28.560 --> 47:34.560
Because he didn't say he wanted to meet Adam West and Burt Ward, so even if he's Barack Obama,

47:34.560 --> 47:37.560
I don't fucking, fucking shit.

47:37.560 --> 47:44.560
Holy bullshit, me, man.

47:44.560 --> 47:49.560
He's in therapy, and his therapist is teaching him how to, she's like, when you have anger,

47:49.560 --> 47:53.560
I want you to, it's okay, you can keep saying, holy, whatever's bugging you,

47:53.560 --> 48:00.560
but you have to, I want you to start telling yourself instead of Batman.

48:00.560 --> 48:04.560
Holy divorce, me, man.

48:04.560 --> 48:07.560
And that's as far, anyways, I just thought that was a funny premise.

48:07.560 --> 48:11.560
I'm not doing myself any favors because the guy doesn't have any reason to like me.

48:11.560 --> 48:14.560
I said, someone stopped a golf cart, and then it was like, there was just,

48:14.560 --> 48:20.560
the whole golf cart was loaded with the entire cast of the Batman original TV show.

48:20.560 --> 48:25.560
I didn't really, I didn't, I was like, if Adam, and then I was like, Adam,

48:25.560 --> 48:29.560
they were like, they're busy, and I found myself angry at them.

48:29.560 --> 48:32.560
And I'm like, why am I mad at them?

48:32.560 --> 48:35.560
And I was also ashamed of myself, because I'm like, what?

48:35.560 --> 48:38.560
And I was like, oh my god, I meet people every day who are going through all this shit,

48:38.560 --> 48:42.560
not to flatter myself, I'm just saying, like, I was like, oh, this is always happening.

48:42.560 --> 48:48.560
It's like, oh, people going like, I also met Walter Koenig,

48:48.560 --> 48:52.560
and I had just watched him and Bruce Campbell in Moon,

48:52.560 --> 48:56.560
what was the fucking movie called, Moon Escape?

48:56.560 --> 48:59.560
It's an awful movie from the 80s, and Walter Koenig's in it.

48:59.560 --> 49:03.560
I couldn't fucking, it was like, why am I telling him this?

49:03.560 --> 49:07.560
Like, it's a shitty movie, he knows it's shitty, like, it's embarrassing,

49:07.560 --> 49:10.560
and it's like, and I knew it the whole time, and I had 20 minutes to stew on it,

49:10.560 --> 49:16.560
and then I ended that 20 minutes and said, sir, I had to say it,

49:16.560 --> 49:21.560
I know it's all that, I know this is a big annoyance and all this stuff,

49:21.560 --> 49:24.560
but I have to say, I just watched the shitty movie you were in yesterday,

49:24.560 --> 49:29.560
whatever the name of it was, and it just stared at me blankly.

49:29.560 --> 49:32.560
I'm like, yeah, of course, like, what do you expect of it?

49:32.560 --> 49:34.560
It makes me feel sad.

49:34.560 --> 49:42.560
Anyways, the election's happening, and, sorry about that detour,

49:42.560 --> 49:46.560
I'd like to bring, her name is Stephanie to the stage.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.560
Stephanie, are you here?

49:48.560 --> 49:50.560
Are you able to come to the stage?

49:50.560 --> 49:52.560
I hope so.

49:52.560 --> 49:58.560
We met, Marley and I were, Marley's mom.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.560
Stop listening, mom.

50:00.560 --> 50:03.560
Your son and I were getting high outside the venue,

50:03.560 --> 50:09.560
and then a couple walked by, and we started, we struck up a conversation,

50:09.560 --> 50:14.560
and the wife, I think she's, I think they're married,

50:14.560 --> 50:17.560
she was just walking her husband to Harmontown,

50:17.560 --> 50:21.560
and she was going to stand in line with him until he got to the front of the line,

50:21.560 --> 50:23.560
and then she didn't have a ticket, and she was going to go home,

50:23.560 --> 50:25.560
because she was just going to support him,

50:25.560 --> 50:30.560
because he's a Harmontown fan, so he's not capable of existing on his own, on a sidewalk.

50:30.560 --> 50:41.560
Stephanie, we started to have a seat and take that mic.

50:41.560 --> 50:44.560
I'm sure you're probably, I don't want to assume this,

50:44.560 --> 50:46.560
but I also want to support you if you are,

50:46.560 --> 50:49.560
obviously you're terrified, or you're nervous, or anxious,

50:49.560 --> 50:52.560
or is this a normal thing to be in front of,

50:52.560 --> 50:54.560
you've been in front of people before?

50:54.560 --> 50:55.560
Oh yeah.

50:55.560 --> 50:59.560
Okay, good, fine, fuck you, alright.

50:59.560 --> 51:03.560
But we talked about, I don't know how it came up,

51:03.560 --> 51:07.560
but the idea that you can beatbox just a little bit,

51:07.560 --> 51:09.560
like you're not claiming expertise.

51:09.560 --> 51:10.560
No.

51:10.560 --> 51:13.560
You're not here to take down any Sucka MCs.

51:13.560 --> 51:15.560
No, no, no, no, no, no.

51:15.560 --> 51:18.560
If that's what beatboxers do,

51:18.560 --> 51:22.560
I don't know in their elaborate chess game,

51:22.560 --> 51:26.560
like if the beatboxer is allowed to take down a Sucka MC,

51:26.560 --> 51:29.560
that may be something that only a queen can do.

51:29.560 --> 51:31.560
Or indeed, whether or not they have anything on you.

51:31.560 --> 51:32.560
Right.

51:32.560 --> 51:33.560
Right.

51:33.560 --> 51:34.560
That was good.

51:34.560 --> 51:37.560
I stand by that.

51:37.560 --> 51:41.560
Well, can we get just a little taste?

51:41.560 --> 51:43.560
Is there anything I can do to make it more comfortable for you?

51:43.560 --> 51:46.560
Do you want some water, some vodka?

51:46.560 --> 51:48.560
I'm good, thank you.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.560
Alright, just a little, it's experimental,

51:50.560 --> 51:53.560
just a little beatboxing.

51:53.560 --> 52:00.560
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

52:00.560 --> 52:02.560
No, Dan, they ain't ready for this one.

52:02.560 --> 52:03.560
Yo.

52:03.560 --> 52:04.560
Are you ready for this one?

52:04.560 --> 52:05.560
Give it up.

52:05.560 --> 52:06.560
Yo.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.560
Oh, shit.

52:07.560 --> 52:08.560
Yo.

52:08.560 --> 52:09.560
Oh, man, give it to him, man.

52:09.560 --> 52:10.560
Yo.

52:10.560 --> 52:11.560
Yo.

52:11.560 --> 52:12.560
Yo.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.560
New York, New York.

52:14.560 --> 52:16.560
Big city, a tiny apple.

52:16.560 --> 52:19.560
I fucked your mom and she gave me some Snapple.

52:19.560 --> 52:21.560
She gave it to me on a vending machine.

52:21.560 --> 52:25.560
I fucked her so hard that one leg gleamed.

52:25.560 --> 52:27.560
And then I took her to dinner.

52:27.560 --> 52:30.560
I'd call your mom a gender winner.

52:30.560 --> 52:34.560
She's an example to us all because I didn't fuck her at all.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.560
I was lying.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.560
And I'm a weak man.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.560
And your mama should lead this land.

52:39.560 --> 52:43.560
And she's put up with enough and she's shown she has merit.

52:43.560 --> 52:46.560
I fucked your mom before a ferret.

52:46.560 --> 52:56.560
That's not easy to keep up, right?

52:56.560 --> 52:58.560
I care, Matt.

52:58.560 --> 53:01.560
Beatboxing filled my hallways in eighth grade.

53:01.560 --> 53:05.560
It was my generation's doo-wop.

53:05.560 --> 53:08.560
I went to a virtually all-black middle school.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.560
I'm not looking at you, Marley.

53:10.560 --> 53:13.560
I said the word black.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.560
I don't see the world through that lens.

53:15.560 --> 53:17.560
I don't connect those dots.

53:17.560 --> 53:19.560
Thank you, I appreciate it.

53:19.560 --> 53:21.560
I went to basically all-black middle school

53:21.560 --> 53:24.560
and it was like one of just a half dozen kids

53:24.560 --> 53:28.560
that were bussed in for the computer specialty.

53:28.560 --> 53:30.560
I don't remember what they called it,

53:30.560 --> 53:33.560
magnet schools or desegregation traps or whatever.

53:33.560 --> 53:35.560
That wasn't a joke.

53:35.560 --> 53:37.560
I mean, that was language that was used.

53:37.560 --> 53:39.560
I went to a magnet school.

53:39.560 --> 53:41.560
Is that what magnet school is?

53:41.560 --> 53:43.560
They take inner-city schools and then they go,

53:43.560 --> 53:46.560
this inner-city school is now the agriculture specialty.

53:46.560 --> 53:49.560
There's just like nine guys from Wichita.

53:49.560 --> 53:52.560
They're like, wait, why would they come from a different...

53:52.560 --> 53:55.560
Wichita was overused in the last show.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.560
I don't know anything about geography.

53:57.560 --> 53:59.560
If you're in Wichita, I'm sorry.

53:59.560 --> 54:01.560
I couldn't point at you on a map.

54:01.560 --> 54:04.560
You're fine. You're a fine human being.

54:04.560 --> 54:07.560
Why am I characterizing you as anything other than

54:07.560 --> 54:10.560
an example of humanity?

54:10.560 --> 54:12.560
You're a good person.

54:12.560 --> 54:14.560
Where was I?

54:14.560 --> 54:16.560
Oh, all black.

54:16.560 --> 54:18.560
Yeah, so everywhere.

54:18.560 --> 54:20.560
You just walked down the hall between classes

54:20.560 --> 54:23.560
and just literally like three dudes,

54:23.560 --> 54:25.560
any three dudes.

54:25.560 --> 54:28.560
There would be one guy freestyling

54:28.560 --> 54:30.560
and then maybe trading off.

54:30.560 --> 54:33.560
It was like triplets.

54:33.560 --> 54:39.560
So I kind of learned to beatbox a little bit too.

54:39.560 --> 54:41.560
That was my only point.

54:41.560 --> 54:44.560
Why do you know how to beatbox?

54:44.560 --> 54:49.560
My first exposure to beatboxing was Razzelle, of course.

54:49.560 --> 54:51.560
Just YouTube videos.

54:51.560 --> 54:53.560
Was Razzelle, of course?

54:53.560 --> 54:57.560
Just Razzelle, comma, of course.

54:57.560 --> 54:59.560
The of course is what puzzles me

54:59.560 --> 55:02.560
because the of course implies I should know who Razzelle is.

55:02.560 --> 55:04.560
And I don't know what...

55:04.560 --> 55:06.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:06.560 --> 55:09.560
He was one of the pioneers of beatboxing.

55:09.560 --> 55:12.560
What about the human beatbox and the fat boys?

55:12.560 --> 55:14.560
I always assumed he was the first beatbox

55:14.560 --> 55:16.560
because his name was the human beatbox.

55:16.560 --> 55:18.560
Right, yeah.

55:18.560 --> 55:20.560
Was there someone before him?

55:20.560 --> 55:24.560
He had a person who was almost literally his Razzelle ghoul.

55:24.560 --> 55:26.560
That was good.

55:26.560 --> 55:29.560
His name is almost Razzelle ghoul.

55:29.560 --> 55:32.560
I also noticed that, yeah.

55:32.560 --> 55:35.560
It goes into the whole Razz-Rache dispute.

55:35.560 --> 55:37.560
Then you have people fighting and stuff

55:37.560 --> 55:39.560
and people say Rache-al ghoul.

55:39.560 --> 55:41.560
Some people say Razzelle ghoul.

55:41.560 --> 55:43.560
I hate that stuff.

55:43.560 --> 55:45.560
It's fucking annoying. I just, like, fuck off.

55:45.560 --> 55:47.560
They should spell it differently if they want you to say it,

55:47.560 --> 55:49.560
not like the letters are.

55:49.560 --> 55:51.560
Exactly.

55:51.560 --> 55:53.560
If it's Rache-al ghoul, there's a goddamn H at the end.

55:53.560 --> 55:56.560
There's all sorts of letters they could use that they're not.

55:56.560 --> 55:58.560
Yeah. Sorry.

56:01.560 --> 56:06.560
Did this Razzelle guy, was he like the actual pioneer of beatboxing?

56:06.560 --> 56:11.560
No, no, no. He was just the first person I saw, like, online.

56:11.560 --> 56:13.560
What era was he?

56:13.560 --> 56:16.560
He was the 80s, late 80s, early 90s.

56:16.560 --> 56:19.560
Mostly, yeah, 80s, early 90s.

56:19.560 --> 56:23.560
It would be, you know, you got Busy Bee, obviously Doug E. Fresh,

56:23.560 --> 56:25.560
then Yes, Big Buff Love.

56:25.560 --> 56:28.560
There was a lot in the late 70s and early 80s doing a lot of beatboxing.

56:28.560 --> 56:30.560
Was Doug E. Fresh doing his own beatboxing?

56:30.560 --> 56:32.560
Yeah.

56:32.560 --> 56:34.560
He was like, the only thing I know is him and Slick Rick.

56:34.560 --> 56:38.560
Yeah, yeah. Children's Story, Mona Lisa, yeah, they killed that shit.

56:38.560 --> 56:44.560
Okay, so, alright, so, wait, I think that's the end of my questions, I think.

56:44.560 --> 56:47.560
Because we know the same amount about beatboxing.

56:47.560 --> 56:49.560
I'm a bad interviewer.

56:55.560 --> 56:57.560
Yeah, but she was really good, like, really good.

56:57.560 --> 56:59.560
Did we ever hang out? Remember?

56:59.560 --> 57:01.560
Yeah, no, for sure.

57:01.560 --> 57:04.560
Okay, guys, this, I...

57:04.560 --> 57:07.560
Is the sound going to be audible?

57:07.560 --> 57:09.560
Well, whatever, we'll find out.

57:09.560 --> 57:13.560
Yeah, I'm staying in a hotel with my girlfriend,

57:13.560 --> 57:17.560
and we fart in front of each other now,

57:17.560 --> 57:19.560
but, like, I...

57:21.560 --> 57:23.560
I don't know what that is.

57:23.560 --> 57:31.560
God damn it, I'm so scared we're going to just find Steve Levy's The Fall Journal.

57:31.560 --> 57:36.560
Just, I just, I was so dread, like, just the hand sketches of women's hair

57:36.560 --> 57:43.560
going over their shoulder, just a red marker across the eyes or something.

57:43.560 --> 57:46.560
Anyways, I, maybe I, maybe I tipped...

57:46.560 --> 57:50.560
Here, I still, like, I try not to fart in front of her,

57:50.560 --> 57:54.560
or try to go to the bathroom and, you know,

57:54.560 --> 57:56.560
sometimes if I feel like it's going to be a loud one,

57:56.560 --> 57:58.560
I'll turn on the water.

57:58.560 --> 58:03.560
And I think I got away with this one, and I wanted to share it with you.

58:03.560 --> 58:06.560
Oh, shit, okay.

58:06.560 --> 58:18.560
That's the water going on.

58:28.560 --> 58:30.560
I don't think she heard it.

58:30.560 --> 58:36.560
I don't see, she was sound asleep.

58:36.560 --> 58:38.560
That was a really good one, though.

58:38.560 --> 58:42.560
That was, that was a solid eight. Solid eight.

58:42.560 --> 58:50.560
I think my hesitant...

58:50.560 --> 58:54.560
It's, it had an M sound, it was like...

58:54.560 --> 58:57.560
It wasn't like a, it was not percussive.

58:57.560 --> 59:00.560
It's not like, it wasn't like a... It was roaning.

59:00.560 --> 59:03.560
It was like...

59:03.560 --> 59:07.560
It has something to say.

59:11.560 --> 59:14.560
Oh, shit, play that again, play that again.

59:14.560 --> 59:17.560
I think I know what it's saying.

59:20.560 --> 59:22.560
No, I didn't, I didn't, I got it wrong.

59:22.560 --> 59:28.560
You thought, you thought it was like a desalinization of seawater.

59:28.560 --> 59:30.560
Like it was like a secret...

59:30.560 --> 59:31.560
Yeah, yeah.

59:31.560 --> 59:35.560
No, I just, I had an idea, and then that was just the lowest common denominator.

59:35.560 --> 59:37.560
So I jettisoned.

59:37.560 --> 59:39.560
I mean, there's a happy guy.

59:39.560 --> 59:43.560
Remember that, you know, for those of you that were at the last show,

59:43.560 --> 59:46.560
you know, there was some question about my level of happiness,

59:46.560 --> 59:50.560
and I think this is a happy person.

59:50.560 --> 59:55.560
I think it's foolish to characterize me as having personality disorders,

59:55.560 --> 59:57.560
and that actually got to me a little bit.

59:57.560 --> 59:59.560
I don't know how many of you were at the thing.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.560
As a joke, we Googled me, and we ended up at this art,

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.560
and it was like, oh, Dan Harmon's a piece of shit,

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.560
because he yelled at a kid on Twitter,

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.560
and like read the whole article and read the thing.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.560
The comments.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.560
I walked away, the comments section, and it was like,

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.560
yeah, I'm fine with this, I'm fine with all of it.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.560
And then I noticed through the rest of the night,

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.560
I was actually really bummed out.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.560
It was on me, it was in me.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.560
It's toxicity, it spreads.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:35.560
So are you supposed to confront the things that make you feel bad,

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.560
or are you supposed to, because that just made me feel bad?

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.560
A little bit.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.560
I think you're supposed to just kind of filter it.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:46.560
You have to remove that toxicity from the universe using yourself.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.560
Kind of like process it through, and like filter it out,

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.560
and like expel that shit, you know, like acknowledge it,

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.560
and then just be like, fuck you, you're a piece of shit,

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.560
I don't have to answer to you, and like...

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.560
Oh, he did that for hours.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.560
Yeah.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.560
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.560
Smoking hot, you know, chill out.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.560
The proudest thing to me is the finger.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:16.560
I think that's so meta, because I'm like,

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.560
I think for a moment about being adorable,

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:25.560
but the thing about being adorable is that it's all about hesitation.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:30.560
That's an image of, oh, should I strike a hesitant pose?

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.560
And then I was like, I hesitate to do that.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:48.560
I'm like, quadruped adorable.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.560
Don't you think that women are heroes?

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:56.560
Like, aren't they just better people?

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.560
Because isn't that gross?

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.560
And can you imagine, like, either she was asleep,

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.560
or she ignored it, or she loves me,

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.560
like she acts like it's fun, like she loves it.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.560
She and I farted on a candle together.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.560
That is fucking lovely, I like that.

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.560
I was like, I was trying to fart on a candle for her,

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.560
for her entertainment, and then I was like,

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.560
thrusting out, I was really wanted to,

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.560
and then I heard a weird sound,

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.560
and I looked back and she had creeped out of bed

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.560
and was like, on the other side of the candle.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.560
That's amazing.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.560
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to, it's hard to define love.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.560
You can't just say, I...

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.560
I feel like you just did, bro.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.560
I love you.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.560
You have to, like, it all comes in the form of,

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.560
like, specific things, and that wouldn't be the same.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.560
Like, that's not Bridget Jones' definition of love.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.560
I haven't seen the third movie yet,

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.560
but I don't know if, I don't think it changes.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.560
I don't think she wants someone to fart on a candle with her.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.560
Stephanie, what's it like being with a Harmontown fan?

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.560
It's awesome.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.560
He's the best.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.560
I love him.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.560
He's introduced me to, he's made,

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.560
he's helping me appreciate humor more,

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.560
he's more funny than me by a long shot.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.560
I've been getting into improv lately,

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.560
which I'm not so great at.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.560
It sounds like he's got some kind of gaslight,

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.560
like, a stockhole, like, yeah,

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.560
Stepford thing over here.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.560
I bet you're better than him in every way.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.560
He sounds like a terrible person.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.560
Yeah, that's what makes people funny.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.560
Terrible people are funny people.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.560
Right?

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:55.560
I fucking love myself.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.560
Why am I so happy?

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.560
I love how old I'm getting,

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.560
I love how gross.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.560
I'm like, oh yeah, I always wanted to be,

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.560
this is who I was in kindergarten,

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.560
and the principal didn't understand that.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.560
So he was like, you should be held back.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.560
You can't move on to first grade.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.560
Why? Because you can't use scissors.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.560
Well, either can this guy.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.560
I'm not supposed to use scissors.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.560
I'm supposed to fucking fart in a bathroom,

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.560
look adorable.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.560
I was noticing how your brow lacks any wrinkles

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.560
in this video.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.560
On a daily basis, I have at least three,

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.560
and especially while concentrating on my task.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.560
What do you mean, in the middle?

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.560
Is that a...

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.560
I got a line there.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.560
Is that a big zone for women?

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.560
It's across.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.560
It's these lines across.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.560
Oh, because that's the definition of old...

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.560
Angry.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.560
I played an old woman in a play,

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.560
and that was my job.

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.560
As I got lazy, the less I spent in makeup,

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.560
I would just take an eyebrow pencil and go,

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.560
line, line, line,

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.560
so that's what you're avoiding is horizontal lines.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.560
Yeah, and that's normally unavoidable,

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.560
especially in this delicate situation,

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.560
and you manage to not have a single furrow.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.560
Well, every night, cucumber slices.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.560
Then I get up, and I let it all out.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.560
What is it?

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.560
Do you want to talk just a little bit about politics,

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.560
but more on the spiritual side?

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.560
I was at a table last night with three women,

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.560
three dudes,

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.560
and then one of the dudes

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.560
was a young Harmontown fan

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:50.560
who came to the table and made the mistake

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.560
of telling Evan Shapiro, head of CISO,

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.560
that he wasn't voting.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.560
Oh, you guys are here.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.560
Don't get a big head.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.560
You're not a hero in this story.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.560
No, you're fine. You're a lamb to the slaughter.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.560
Evan Shapiro is like, oh, my God,

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.560
you're not going to vote.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.560
I'm like...

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.560
I sympathize with everybody,

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.560
but the funny thing is that there's a bunch of dudes,

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.560
one of them yelling, everybody laughing,

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.560
then I have all this talking and all this stuff,

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.560
and my girlfriend and two other women

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.560
were the other half of the table,

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.560
and it was kind of like...

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.560
I picked up a couple of sound bites

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.560
that it's as if women

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.560
aren't going through something right now

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.560
where they're all looking at each other going,

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.560
like, do you fucking believe this?

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:40.560
Like, does it, no matter how they feel,

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.560
they're just like, does anyone not...

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.560
I don't know, can you give voice to that

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.560
so that I'm not mansplaining it?

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.560
Yeah, well, I mean, as a human,

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.560
I don't know about how my woman status plays into it,

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.560
but as a human, I'm looking at this election going,

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.560
like, what the hell? How did this happen?

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.560
How did this crazy person get so far?

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.560
And so popular.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.560
But do you get mad when people are...

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.560
Is there something inside you that's like,

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.560
is it frustrating?

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.560
Because it's everybody's argument to have,

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.560
everybody's decision, is it frustrating

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.560
because does it feel a little bit like,

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.560
this is my time, this is my space,

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.560
this is not really in the grand scheme of elections,

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:28.560
can you fucking pick up this bullshit some other time,

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.560
and can we get this over with

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.560
where we make this historic important step?

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.560
Do you ever...

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.560
I don't want to put words or thoughts in your mouth,

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.560
and I don't know if...

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.560
Maybe that would offend you that you're like,

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.560
I'm characterizing you as blinded by a pheromonal

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.560
fucking higher calling.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.560
I don't know, just save the show,

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.560
tell us where you're at.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.560
Yeah, no pressure.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.560
Speak for all women and get a standing ovation.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.560
Yeah, okay.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.560
Back into the goal of a standing ovation from all women,

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.560
and then just imagine, what would I say to get that?

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.560
I'm kidding, obviously,

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.560
that's a terrible way to approach creativity.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.560
So women are awesome.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.560
The alternative is you just say how you actually feel,

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.560
and knowing that someone out there

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.560
might put a Reddit post and say,

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.560
like, she's got a lot of nerve.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.560
If you're willing to risk that,

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.560
just say, you can just say how you feel.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.560
I do appreciate that the dialogue on women

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.560
has become so much more the forefront

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.560
of everything right now,

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.560
and for once, people are angry at the things

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.560
that Donald Trump and like are saying,

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.560
which is huge.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.560
Just the fact that there are so many women and men

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.560
coming out and saying that's so or not okay,

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.560
it's so or not okay that we would actually vote

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.560
for someone of the opposite party, for example,

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.560
based on just these comments,

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.560
little on policy and all those other issues that are nasty.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.560
I don't even know what's going on with Republican women.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.560
That already sounded like an oxymoron

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.560
before this election.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.560
But then again, somebody's a Republican woman.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560
They exist, there's lots of them, right?

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.560
I don't know what the numbers were,

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.560
but you've been paying more attention to that than me.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:14.560
Has there been a huge exodus from GOP women

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.560
that are saying like, this guy's the worst

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.560
and it has to do with who I am,

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.560
like fuck fiscal policy, fuck class struggle,

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.560
fuck cultural shock, like for this four years,

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.560
I'm with her.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.560
Have you encountered, seen that?

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.560
So in my social circles,

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.560
I generally congregate with liberal women

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.560
and liberal men who are like minded.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.560
But from my readings in the Washington Post,

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:52.560
I see more and more women of every political leaning

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.560
saying, you know, I'm with her.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.560
He's a pig, yeah.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.560
All right, well, it's too light.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.560
There's nothing we can do about it.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.560
Look at those airs after the apocalypse.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.560
Mm-hmm.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.560
All we can really do is...

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:15.560
...in like a lamb, out like a lion.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.560
Like how happy I am.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.560
It's like I don't know the world is at stake.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.560
Is this guy even going to vote?

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.560
Look at his face.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.560
This guy may not even vote.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.560
He may just get out one of his hands

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.560
and say, you know what?

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560
I don't know.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.560
He may not even vote.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.560
He may just get out one of his old stickers from the drawer.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.560
Just to stick on it.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.560
I was like, oh, there's a lot of lint on it,

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.560
so there's scotch tape behind it.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.560
So this is from the...

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.560
This is from the Nader election.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.560
Still stick straight to my shirt.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.560
Now, I'm going to, yeah...

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.560
I mean, I'm going to go and I'm going to pull the lever

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.560
very proudly for somebody that,

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.560
in spite of all my political opinions,

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.560
which are left of anarchy,

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.560
which means I wish that everybody that ever thought

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.560
they had the right to tell us what to do

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.560
would die in a fucking inferno.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.560
Like, so who do you vote for?

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.560
The Green Party?

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.560
I don't like them either.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.560
I know there's got to be a better way,

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.560
but I also don't like the look on people's faces

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.560
if I tell them I didn't vote

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.560
and the posturing about how the system isn't going to work

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.560
and all this stuff.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.560
I would never, ever, ever tell anybody

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.560
that was choosing to write in their roommate

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.560
or vote for a third-party candidate

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.560
or even not to go vote.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.560
At the point where you're bullying those people,

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.560
you've got to step back and ask yourself,

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.560
all they're saying is they're not voting

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.560
for this particular fucking system,

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.560
and if your only advertisement for it is to yell at them,

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.560
like, what do you expect them to do?

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.560
Oh, yeah, so sorry.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.560
Like, if you want them to be a fan of democracy,

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.560
at least give them the space to waste their vote.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.560
Like, that should be their right.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.560
And I'm going to, but I always go,

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.560
I'm going to go pull the lever for the Democratic candidate

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.560
because this fucking guy is an emergency

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:26.560
and I resent the fact that I should be tending to an emergency

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.560
with my fucking vote.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.560
That shouldn't be my vote's job.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.560
Like, so I'm, like, but it's not the time to protest

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.560
because both voting and protest voting

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.560
aren't going to make a fucking difference.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.560
That's the problem.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.560
Revolution doesn't happen behind that curtain.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.560
If anything behind that curtain could happen

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.560
that was powerful, it would have been made illegal

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.560
a long time ago.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.560
And so, but I'm going to go do it out of solidarity

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.560
and then I'm, like, we got to fucking for real.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.560
We got to, like, figure out how to get to, like,

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.560
we got to...

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.560
Yeah.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.560
And then, like, we got to fix this.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.560
We got to, like, if you're a human being

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.560
and you're, like, living within the system,

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.560
like, you have the right to go stand out on the street corner

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.560
and say, I don't like the system.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.560
I think it should change.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.560
And if somebody comes and stuns you with a taser

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.560
and, like, puts you in a van,

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.560
then you've done your job that day.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.560
Like, because you've proven, like,

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.560
when we give AIDS to cancer,

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.560
as we talked about in a previous episode,

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.560
you're alerting white blood cells

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.560
to a thing that should be fought.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:42.560
And we'll get started on that after Tuesday.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.560
Like, we got to, we got to just go, like,

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.560
okay, that's great, historical.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.560
She's president, like, now let's fix this shit.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.560
These people are born rich.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.560
They have no fucking entitlement to talk to us like animals.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.560
We got to have representative democracy.

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.560
And then just, like...

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.560
It's, I'm so proud of it.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.560
Like, look at me.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.560
Look at, there's a woman that loves him.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.560
And she's gorgeous.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.560
She's amazing looking.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.560
That's not why I like her.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.560
I noticed how hot she was,

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.560
like, three conversations into

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.560
making intellectual love to her.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.560
Is that, do I protest too much?

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560
That's beautiful.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.560
Okay.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560
All right, give me a beatbox.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560
Let's do a New York rap.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.560
And then, and I want to, I want to,

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.560
like, wait, five, wait, what time is it?

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.560
Five, it says five o'clock in here.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.560
What?

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.560
Eight o' four.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:48.560
Okay, great.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.560
This is good.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.560
We're doing good.

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.560
It's kind of an okay show.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.560
Yeah, okay.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.560
All right, that response was telling.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.560
We'll figure it out.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560
Sorry.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.560
Well, you know what?

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.560
Then go back in time and don't come.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.560
You can't, can you?

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.560
Give me a beatbox.

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.560
We'll do a little New York rap.

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.560
And then I'm going to make that seat available

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.560
for somebody from the city that's feeling pain.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.560
Or pleasure.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.560
Yo.

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.560
Yo.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:31.560
130th Street to 65th took the subway down

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:35.560
and I smoked a spliff of reefer weed.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.560
I fucked your mama because she was in need.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:45.560
I'm a charitable contributor to your mama's pussy with my dick

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.560
and my balls every summer, spring, winter and fall.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:56.560
I put my penis in her vagina from New York to North Carolina.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:00.560
The eastern seaboard is your mama's pussy.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.560
The eastern seaboard is your mama's

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.560
and I was like, one syllable for vagina.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.560
Nothing acceptable.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.560
No, there's no such thing as a one syllable word for a vagina

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.560
that's going to end your rap well.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.560
We should come up with one.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.560
Bob.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.560
I'm pitching.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.560
Just call it Bob.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.560
Bob.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.560
Bob.

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.560
Bob.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.560
Bob.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.560
Bob.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.560
Bob.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:28.560
Bob.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.560
Just call it Bob.

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.560
Bob.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.560
Bob.

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.560
Oh, no.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.560
Box is gross.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:38.560
It's all gross if it's one syllable, I think.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.560
Is there a one syllable word for...

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.560
What?

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.560
We know those ones.

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.560
Cunt is all the way over into like refreshing,

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.560
like it's like the N word of vaginas.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:48.560
Veg.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.560
Veg.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.560
Veg.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.560
Come on, gang.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.560
Gash.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.560
No, I mean, do you hear yourself?

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.560
I didn't ask.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:01.560
I wasn't saying, hey, name...

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.560
I know they exist.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:08.560
My question is, are there ones that make us feel comfortable?

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.560
Vag is fine.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.560
Vag is...

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.560
Vag is good.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560
Vag is... I'm never saying it.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:17.560
But that's for bridal showers.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.560
Vag seems okay.

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.560
I'll let you ladies take that one back.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.560
How about slit?

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.560
Do people say slit?

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.560
Oh, that's gross, too.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.560
Wait, was that bad?

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.560
I don't know.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.560
I think it's just gross.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.560
It's like if you called it mud or something.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560
No one wants to do that.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.560
Who doesn't like to play in some mud?

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.560
Well, without question.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.560
Yeah, there's no...

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.560
Like, there should be one that's like earth.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.560
Or...

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.560
Like, I guess that's mud.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.560
Hole?

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.560
Yeah, that's not bad.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.560
Did you say hole?

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.560
Hole.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.560
Oh, hole?

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.560
No, hole.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.560
With an H.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.560
No, hole's bad.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.560
With an H.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:57.560
Yes.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.560
I know.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.560
I get it.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.560
The rug.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.560
What?

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.560
The rug.

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.560
All right, if you're just going to boo everything.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.560
Like, I'm just...

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.560
I thought slit and rug were really good.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.560
I mean, slit's clever.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.560
It's just...

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.560
I don't know.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.560
Just saying it's like moist.

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.560
It does feel a little dirty.

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.560
It does feel a little dirty.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.560
It's not like it's...

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.560
Bean?

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.560
Bean.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560
That's like the most important part.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560
All right.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.560
Here's my pitch.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.560
Okay, you're going to say I'm white knighting.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.560
Here it is.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.560
For real pitch.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.560
Imagine using this in slang.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.560
It would be awesome.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.560
Life.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:33.560
Yo, son, you get some of that life?

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.560
No, I was all up in that life last night.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.560
You get that life?

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:38.560
Yeah.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.560
That's like that was the worst guy's got.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.560
And then it was like, yeah, like we get it.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.560
It's life.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.560
That's why we want it.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.560
Yeah.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.560
And like, it's still gross, but like, because we're objectifying it, but we're at least

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:57.560
like a cosmology like placing it like it's like, yo, yo, yo, yo, son, you get some of

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:00.560
that life?

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:06.560
So I, a lady called out, a lady called out that holes don't have agency.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.560
Oh, they do.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.560
They don't.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.560
They don't.

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:10.560
They should.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.560
How, how would we...

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.560
They should.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.560
They should.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:19.560
But I think we could give holes agency like we can make that happen.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.560
How would you give a whole agency though?

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.560
Well, oh, oh, linguistically, you mean.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:27.560
Uh, well, like a Sarlacc pit, like, I mean.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.560
Right.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.560
It's like a gatekeeper in that sense.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.560
How do you give a whole agency?

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.560
Well, I mean, I, yeah.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.560
You put a door on it.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.560
You put a door on it.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.560
Yeah.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.560
Then it's a hole.

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.560
It's not just like something that can be affected.

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:48.560
Then it's like, you know, I, I, I, I think older men than us have come up with these solutions.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:55.560
You should put an iron, a door with a lock and then a, like it's made of iron and, uh,

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.560
yeah, I don't know.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.560
Yeah.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.560
Well, what, no, I, I, look, I'm putting it out there.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:06.560
It's not going to come from me.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:09.560
You, you, you female harmonians go figure it out.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.560
That's what you do.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:17.560
You create, create a one syllable word for your vagina and make it beautiful.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.560
I'm counting on you.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.560
I believe in you.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:23.560
My name is Dan Harmon and I approve this message.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:30.560
Uh, I don't think my irony landed and a lot of people started hating me.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.560
They're like, is he telling women what to do?

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:36.560
No, I'm, look, I'm scared of you.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.560
Um, did you just say he was scared of us?

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.560
That's not comforting either.

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.560
That's what they say before shooting sprays.

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.560
Um, okay.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.560
Noted.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.560
Uh, split the diff.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.560
Uh, give me a break.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:54.560
Will you?

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:59.560
Um, okay.

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.560
Never mind.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.560
Never mind.

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.560
Okay.

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:08.560
Uh, let's have a hand for Stephanie, uh, for her beatboxing.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:18.560
You can go rejoin your, uh, seat.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.560
Thank you.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.560
So I'm glad we ran into each other.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:24.560
I mean, like the, the, the, we live in an alternate universe now where you came to the show instead

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.560
of going home.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.560
Who knows what you would have done.

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.560
She's ignoring me.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.560
Yep.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:34.560
Uh, that's a, that's a tasty beat box for a stranger.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:35.560
That was really good.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560
She said she did it.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:37.560
She kind of knew how to beat box.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.560
I mean, come on.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:39.560
That's a beat box.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:45.560
You got to understand, like she did not like, like, like she was not like, well, can I be

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.560
on stage?

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:50.560
Like I definitely totally like descended on her and was like, that would be fun.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:54.560
And she was like, uh, like so just so you know.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.560
Uh, uh, okay.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:57.560
So all right.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:04.560
Let's, let's, let's mine New York for a non nine 11 related, uh, probably non election

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.560
related.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.560
It's eight 11.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.560
Yeah.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.560
It's eight 11.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.560
Okay.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:17.560
If not for daylight savings, it would be nine 11.

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:29.560
It's, it's more meaningful because it involves remembering.

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:34.560
The remembering is built in to the eight 11 commemoration.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:38.560
It's like part nine 11 part memorial.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.560
I agree.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:45.560
Uh, is, is, is anybody, uh, anybody here?

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.560
Uh, let's say I want to ask for something specific.

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.560
You guys are so polite and nice.

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.560
Like you've been, you've been great.

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:51.560
Like it's New York.

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:54.560
They function as a, as a, as an entity.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.560
That's what they do for a living.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.560
People in LA are like, who's this person?

01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.560
Why are they near me?

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:00.560
Yeah.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.560
New York is just like, I live on top of people.

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:04.560
So I'm not going to.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.560
It's kind of like get away from me.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.560
Like it's like we're trying to do us and just get away and go is how we kind of

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.560
operate.

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:12.560
I think it's just, well, yeah.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:17.560
It's like, it's like, okay, I'm like, I'm in a jar of people that you just, and

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:21.560
you just like, there's a dead stair that comes with that.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:27.560
But if you tap the jar, they're like, how can I help you?

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.560
Like, cause they're not dead.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.560
They're just like, that's their job.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:32.560
They're in a jar.

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.560
That's the best thing they can do.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:39.560
They're like focused, like, like in a, in a space camp when they get, they get

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.560
accidentally launched into space, the kids.

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:44.560
And there's a point where it's like, oh, we only have so much oxygen.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.560
You know what takes up oxygen?

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.560
Complaining.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:48.560
It really does.

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:52.560
Like at a point, like the guy who played the, the gay nerd in revenge of the

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.560
nerds, like he was, he was, he was talking about French fries.

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.560
Remember that monologue?

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.560
And he's like, he's like, he's joking.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:02.560
He's joking. He's some French fries. And, and, and I don't know if it's the

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:04.560
Val Kilmer, like analog.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:08.560
There's a guy who's like, hey, listen, I'm using up air, man.

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.560
And he's like, okay, cool.

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.560
Let's just, just want to do a monologue about the guy who ate French fries.

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:16.560
Cause anyways, I'm just saying, what was I saying?

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.560
It's, it's, it, it, it, it, it's a jar of people.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.560
Yeah. New York is like that.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:25.560
Like everybody, like they look, you look at them and they're on the street and

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.560
you're like, oh, they, they hate themselves and each other.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.560
They're just making it work. They're fine.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:34.560
Every time you bump into one of them, they're like, they like wake up.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.560
It's like Westworld. Like they, they're like, they're, they're like,

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:41.560
how, how, I'm, my name is Tony.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:44.560
I'm fucking, I'm like, what, what do you need?

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.560
Like, I mean, they're not all like, what do you need?

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.560
Some of them are like, I'm going to stab you.

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:53.560
But, but they like, they're, it's not, it's not their fault.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.560
It's not their fault.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.560
It's a big city. It's a vertically arranged.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.560
It's not a lot of room to spread out.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.560
It's got to get tedious.

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.560
But also you should stay here because Los Angeles is definitely going to,

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:10.560
it's a, it's going to fall into the ocean.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.560
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.560
I'm going to be moving here soon.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.560
And like, like, like, yeah, because you guys have,

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:20.560
which will raise the property value in your neighborhood,

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:27.560
foisting you out into a further like Jersey ish.

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:32.560
And you'll be like, what's up with all these fucking Harmon's coming?

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.560
And then there'll be like a special Harmon van that picks me up from my brownstone

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:42.560
and takes me up to the tower where, where I do my podcast.

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:46.560
But the bus won't be accountable to like tickets and stuff.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.560
And then you guys will stand in the way of it.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.560
And like, fuck these Harmon buses.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:56.560
Have you seen, have you seen those lift buses?

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.560
They're ridiculous.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.560
They're just, they're just city buses except they have lift on them.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.560
I've seen them in LA.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.560
Oh no, I haven't.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.560
Oh yeah, lift buses.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.560
So there's open sourcing public transit.

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.560
Yeah.

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:12.560
I hear they're rolling out a program where instead of picking up people on demand,

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.560
they'll just go from place to place.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:19.560
And people can get on and off at will.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.560
It's a real, what do you call it?

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.560
Disruptive marketing campaign.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:29.560
You can, you can get a transfer.

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:30.560
Yeah.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.560
Yeah, that's amazing.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:32.560
Yeah.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:38.560
If you, if you earn enough points, you can slowly move from where you sit in the bus,

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.560
like toward the, yeah.

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:41.560
Oh no, that's, that's complicated.

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:42.560
That'd be fun.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.560
Yeah.

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:48.560
I feel like meow meow beans.

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.560
I thought that would happen.

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.560
All right.

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:58.560
So who right now in the Gramercy Theater just like use your instincts and just ask yourself,

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:02.560
would I improve this show if I can?

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.560
Well, let's just try that.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.560
Let's just be open about it.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.560
Like you, you, you, your, your hands are moving.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:11.560
Are you, you had an interesting day?

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.560
Okay.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.560
Let's, let's, let's, do you want to come up and, okay.

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:21.560
We're, we're, we're a cosmopolitan city.

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:24.560
Like we don't have to put a, a skin on it.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.560
Or are you like, who likes blue?

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:30.560
And everyone's like, I like blue because I really just want to be up there.

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.560
This is like, who wants to be up here?

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:33.560
I do.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:34.560
Hello.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.560
I like red, some person said.

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.560
What are you, come on, knock it off.

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:42.560
Not everything's a wise crack.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.560
All right.

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.560
What'd you say your name was?

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:45.560
My name's Jared.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:46.560
Jared?

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.560
Yeah.

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:48.560
Awesome.

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:49.560
All right.

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.560
Hey, Jared.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.560
How's it going, man?

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.560
Marley.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.560
Spencer.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:57.560
That's a, that's a famous name.

01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.560
Yeah.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:02.560
I, I, I, when you say Jared, people always say, Oh, Jerry.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.560
No.

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.560
Oh, Jared.

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:05.560
No.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.560
Oh, Gary.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.560
And so I always had to say like Jared, like from the subway commercials, but I can't

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.560
do that anymore.

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:09.560
Yeah.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:12.560
Jared, like the prisoner.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.560
Right.

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.560
Right.

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.560
You know, like prison.

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:17.560
Okay.

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.560
Jared.

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:21.560
Well, are you young enough to ask how old you are?

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.560
I just turned 25 a few days ago.

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.560
Adorable.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:26.560
Nice.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.560
Thank you.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.560
Welcome to earth.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.560
Good luck.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.560
Thank you.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.560
What, so yeah, tell us about your day.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:40.560
A few, like two, three days ago, I got my gallbladder taken out.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:41.560
Yeah.

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:42.560
Yeah.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.560
It was my, it was my second procedure in like five days because I like couldn't sleep.

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:50.560
It was this horrible pain every night for like 12 hours.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.560
And then they're like, Oh, you've got a thing in your bile duct.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.560
And I was like, that's a gross word.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.560
And then they got the thing out of the bile duct.

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.560
And then they're like, Oh, we got the thing out of the bile duct.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.560
But then we saw what their shit with your gallbladder.

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:00.560
So we need to get that out.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:01.560
So then I got my gallbladder.

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.560
They haven't figured out when to take your gallbladder out by now.

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.560
It's very popular in women over 40.

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.560
Do you just mean the doctors?

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.560
Like if you go to the hospital, that's the shift.

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.560
It's like your gallbladders going out.

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:16.560
Right.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.560
They love, they love removing them.

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:19.560
Yeah.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.560
No, it, it tend, it's, it's normally like women like in their 40s or 50s to get their

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:24.560
gallbladders out.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.560
But I was having this pain and they're like, Oh, it's probably your gallbladder.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.560
And then.

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.560
Right.

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.560
Which is a really routine thing.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.560
I mean, not, it's not.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:32.560
No, it's not like, it's a pretty minor surgeon.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.560
But I just curious because they said, Oh, they, they bothered to take this like half

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:39.560
step or they're like, there's something in the area of your gallbladder.

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.560
It's like, yeah, motherfucker.

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.560
Yeah.

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:42.560
Yeah.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.560
It's called the gallbladder attack.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.560
Right.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.560
You've removed the gallbladder.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:46.560
Yeah.

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.560
I'm, I'm the offensive urban doctor.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.560
Right.

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:58.560
Motherfucker, you gotta just give this motherfucker MRI and get over the shit.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:06.560
I'm, I'm, I don't open my mouth when I talk to her.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:13.560
Give this motherfucker a marrow transplant before I bust the fucking.

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.560
All right.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.560
Anyways, as a new character, probably won't stick.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.560
I don't know.

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.560
Didn't see workshopped it in New York.

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:26.560
If anyone was going to go for it, it would have been them.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:27.560
Didn't work out.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.560
Continue Jared.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.560
So anyway, I, I, yeah.

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:35.560
So as for the past few weeks, I've been dealing with this whole like gallbladder and all the

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.560
pain and stuff.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:40.560
And it's, it's, once they took it out, I feel like fucking great except I ate Zinburger

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.560
today, which was probably, I probably could have made a better choice.

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.560
Well, tell us.

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:45.560
So I live today.

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:46.560
Well, I'm sorry.

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:52.560
I don't want to derail you, but like, I gallbladder, like I've known guys that have the gallbladder

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.560
removed.

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:56.560
I feel like it's, it seems like a thing that would happen to me.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.560
Like it's, I seem like a kind of person that would have a gallbladder removed.

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:04.560
The thing is, once it's out, you're just relying on your liver.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.560
For what?

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:06.560
Yeah.

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:14.560
It basically, as, as I understand it, your gallbladder like processes fat and that kind

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.560
of shit.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:18.560
And so, uh, normally they're like, Oh, we can just take your gallbladder out and your

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.560
liver will take care of it and it will be fine.

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.560
Oh, you know what?

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.560
I'm getting it mixed up with the goddamn appendix.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:24.560
Oh no.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:25.560
Yeah.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.560
And I was doing the, I was like, what the fuck?

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:31.560
The appendix, the appendix is like this thing.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.560
It's like vestigial.

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.560
And then it hurts.

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.560
Some people, it's just hurting and you just, we'll get that fucker out of there.

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.560
Gallbladder.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:39.560
Okay.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:45.560
So you, how many do you have before you get a gallectomy?

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:46.560
One.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.560
One.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.560
So it's like your liver or your heart.

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.560
Right.

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.560
In that it's a one.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.560
It's a oneer.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:52.560
It's not an open surgery.

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:56.560
It's like four holes in my body right now and they sort of like it's here and they got,

01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:01.560
I swear to God, they like basically guide it down and pull it out of your belly button.

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:05.560
They pull the whole organ out, but they don't actually cut you open and go in there.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.560
What are you showing me?

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.560
That's my, that's a hole in my belly button.

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.560
Okay.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:11.560
And then there's other holes up here.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.560
Wow.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.560
And they're like fresh.

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:14.560
I want to see the whole.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:15.560
Yeah.

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:16.560
Let me see.

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.560
Oh, okay.

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.560
It's like 50 cents.

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:22.560
They're like little bullet holes.

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:28.560
It was like they kept missing Jesus Christ.

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:29.560
Explain that a little bit.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:33.560
I don't, I don't really, well I was asleep.

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.560
Yeah.

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.560
Yeah.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.560
So dirty.

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.560
Women over 40.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.560
How recent is your gallbladderectomy?

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.560
Okay.

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:55.560
So you've got just little, little sexy like, but it looks like you got shot like, yeah.

01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:56.560
Wait, how does it look now?

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.560
It looks less gross than this, right?

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:00.560
It's fine.

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:01.560
It's good.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.560
You're all dark.

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.560
That's as close as anybody's going to get to me.

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:07.560
You should bring up your gallbladder scars and show.

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.560
It's fine.

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:11.560
Like, you're a good city.

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:12.560
I don't want to.

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:13.560
We're in the same room.

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:14.560
He's coming.

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.560
I don't want to discourage you.

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:16.560
He's behind us?

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.560
Very close, though.

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:18.560
Oh, yeah.

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.560
Well, bring him over here.

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:20.560
No, that's great.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.560
Grandpa will, yeah.

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.560
That looks fine.

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.560
I have that to look forward to.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:24.560
Oh, yeah.

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:25.560
That's not too bad.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:26.560
I have that to look forward to.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.560
Bring him over here.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.560
I guess they just give it to guys with this haircut.

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:33.560
You guys are, you guys are fucking identical.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:39.560
Just ethnically ambiguous guys with this haircut.

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:41.560
I had my, I had gallbladder stones.

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.560
Did you not have those?

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:43.560
Yeah, I did.

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:46.560
But they were minor compared to the ones in the Bible.

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.560
All right, you guys.

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:49.560
The jigs up.

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:55.560
You're, you're a famous, you guys are directors, I assume.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.560
We're the Duffer brothers.

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:01.560
You're the something brothers for sure.

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.560
Just can you hike up your shirt, sweetie?

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:05.560
Oh, oh, oh.

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:06.560
Turn around.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:07.560
Give us a look.

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:08.560
No.

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.560
Oh, yeah.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:10.560
It's virtually invisible.

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:11.560
Yeah.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:12.560
You can't even see it.

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.560
And there was one in the belly button, but that kind of didn't.

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:14.560
Did you get it done in the city?

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.560
No, in LA.

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:16.560
In the city.

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:17.560
In the city.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:18.560
This is the city.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:22.560
I know you sound, but that's not, you sound like a character from Frankenstein.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.560
Did you get from the city?

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:26.560
Go up into town?

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:31.560
Well, if you, if you live in Brooklyn or anywhere else, I mean, hands the city and

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:32.560
there's a lot of good surgeons.

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:33.560
Yeah.

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.560
I know.

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:35.560
I know.

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.560
What does the city mean downtown or?

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.560
No, the city means Manhattan for the most part.

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.560
I'm from New Jersey.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.560
In Los Angeles, the city means, in Los Angeles, the city means something went wrong.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.560
I'm going to the city.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:49.560
What do you why?

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:52.560
Did a friend of yours stay up all night?

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:54.560
Like, why are they there?

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.560
I'm from Encina, so I know you're talking about.

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.560
Yeah.

01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:58.560
There's a Hooverville.

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.560
That's a real Hooverville.

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.560
All right.

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:02.560
Yeah.

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.560
Well, okay.

01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.560
So they suck it.

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.560
So you're saying they can remove, they remove the gallbladder.

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.560
This is what I don't understand.

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:10.560
I can, I can understand.

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.560
It's a robot.

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:17.560
They use a little claws to go inside and like, yeah, two of the, so the smaller ones.

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.560
I should have found this all out before.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:24.560
They put like the tools inside and they, they kind of maneuvered out and then they suck

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.560
it out.

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:29.560
I thought it was through the bigger scar, not the belly button, but maybe your surgeon

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.560
did it differently.

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.560
But what about the duct work?

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.060
That's what I don't understand is when you remove something, you have to like deal with

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:40.560
the tubes going in and out and you're saying like, there's a robot being put in there.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:47.560
Like the robot goes in the, in the, in the body and the robot's like in there stitching.

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.560
It's sent to you.

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.560
It goes inside.

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.560
Jesus Christ, man.

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.560
Yeah.

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.560
We're going to, you're going to live forever.

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.560
Probably.

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:56.560
You kids.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:57.560
Well, actually, I don't know.

01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.060
Your surgery was pretty recent.

01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.560
If not, he can just replace me.

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.560
Oh, no.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:09.560
I mean, like they say the doctors told me that 90% of people feel no difference, but I totally

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.560
experienced like certain digestive kinks.

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.560
So just be aware.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:17.560
Like if, like if you see stuff that makes you want to puke, you're, you're, you're kind

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:19.560
of like, ah, it's all right.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:20.560
No, no, no.

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.560
It's more actually like fatty food, like fried chicken.

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.560
Yeah.

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:27.060
Also like Dan, I know you mentioned once that like when you poop, it's usually after you

01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:28.060
eat.

01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:29.560
It's kind of like one in one out, like a club or something.

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:35.060
I've, I wasn't like that before, but now after I eat, if I walk around, which you do a lot

01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:36.060
in.

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:37.060
I've always been like that.

01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:38.560
I've always been the same way.

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.560
It's been random.

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.560
If anything, now I'm constipated, but it's because of the percocet.

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.560
I poop like clockwork after I eat.

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:50.560
Like I eat, I, I, I believe that I'm a, like a reverse pes dispenser, like that I, that

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:57.360
I take a bite of a burger, there's a poop, the size of a bite of a burger that needs

01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:58.360
to come out of my butt.

01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360
That's how I experienced.

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.960
I was at work and there's this halal card across the street.

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:05.360
So I often go to the halal card one time that gave me a lot of extra shit.

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.360
Uh, so, so I was eating it and like as I was eating it, I was like, oh, I'm going to go.

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.860
So I'm at work and I went and I pooped and I came back out.

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:13.860
I work in a very small office.

01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:15.360
I kept eating and then I had to poop again.

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.860
And then there was a third time and I was like, something's got to give.

01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:23.360
I didn't want to be the guy who gets up and poops at least three times a day within like

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.360
an hour.

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:29.060
So I just told my boss I wasn't feeling well and I went home and I took a three day

01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:30.560
weekend because I was embarrassed.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.560
And you know what?

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:34.560
There's no hashtag for us.

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.560
Thank you.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:42.560
No one cares about, about white guys that have to poop all the time.

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.560
The fecal express.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.060
Hashtag poopy problems.

01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:48.560
I met porn stars today.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.560
Okay.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.560
You were telling us why your date was interesting and I was like, you got a gold letter.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.560
I don't want to steal your thunder.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.560
I'm sorry.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:57.560
Big fan.

01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:58.560
What was your name again?

01:37:58.560 --> 01:37:59.560
Alex.

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:00.560
Alex.

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:01.560
That's my middle name.

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:02.560
Alex.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.560
And there's no way for you guys to touch the points of your gold letter.

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.560
Nothing would happen.

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:07.560
Nothing would happen anyway.

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.560
Do you want to give it a try?

01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:10.560
No.

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.560
I mean, I mean, like if you touch them together.

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.560
Oh, wow.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.560
Yours are fresh.

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.560
Yeah.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.560
No, he's right.

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:16.560
He's, he's, he's, it's.

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.560
That's a health hazard.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:18.560
And I'm glad that you pointed that out.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.560
That's crazy.

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.560
Yeah.

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:21.560
Put some cocoa butter on it.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:22.560
They're shiny.

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.560
Like there's stuff on them.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.560
It's not, it's not a judgment.

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:31.560
Like they're both, they're clearly, they're, they're family.

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.560
Like these two, they're, they're not, they're.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560
Wait.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:38.560
There's not a lot of support out there for younger people that have this.

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:42.560
It's a good, like these chat rooms and these subreddits and it's just all old people.

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.560
And it makes you feel really, really small.

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.560
I didn't mean to yawn into the mic.

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:56.560
Hey, um, hey, you've got some gall.

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.560
It's a miracle.

01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.560
Run fast, take chances everybody.

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.560
We, you know, we don't got a lot of time left and we owe something.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:05.560
Oh, we do.

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.560
Oh shit.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.560
So, um, I have, I had this idea.

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:15.560
I know, you know, everyone's been wanting to play D&D, wants us to play D&D again.

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.560
Yeah.

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:19.560
All right.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.560
So, um, I was thinking maybe we could play D&D.

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.560
So first we need characters, do you want to reprise Sharpie or do you want to just, um.

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560
I'll be Sharpie of course.

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.560
Okay.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.560
So just, we're very short on time gentlemen.

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.560
So quickly you got to, who are your characters?

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:35.560
Who do you want to be?

01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:36.560
Who do you want to be in you?

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:37.560
Let's go you first, Jared.

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.560
I'm, I'm picking one of like.

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:39.560
You're making a character.

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:40.560
You can make it up.

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.560
Whatever.

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.560
You can pick Jeff.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.560
Whatever.

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:44.560
Fast.

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:45.560
Okay.

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:46.560
I'll just, I'll just pick Jeff's character.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.560
Awesome.

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:48.560
Not Bone Weevil.

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:49.560
What is it?

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:50.560
Quark.

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:51.560
Quark.

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:54.560
What is a Cuminos character?

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:55.560
Christopher.

01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:56.560
Christopher, yeah.

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:57.560
Okay.

01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:58.560
Lady in red.

01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.560
I'm gonna go ahead and do my own character.

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.560
DM Paladin Elf.

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.560
Awesome.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.560
That's what we do.

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.560
What's his name?

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.560
D, it's a she, it's a she.

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:05.560
Oh.

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:06.560
Yeah.

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:07.560
I'm so sorry.

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:08.560
It's okay.

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.560
You didn't tell me your D&D character was a she.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.560
So I don't like brag about it, but I'm down.

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:14.560
You know what's up.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.560
Pretty amazing.

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.560
All right.

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.560
You're like.

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:21.560
I got one of my five black friends as a transgender D&D player.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:31.560
Alright, you enter the village full of junk food, but all you want to do is snack.

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.560
Make a will save.

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:41.560
Oh, you can't resist the temptation of all this junk food.

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.560
Come on, you eat the junk food.

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:48.560
I try to eat the junk food because it seems to be the only option.

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:49.560
Yeah.

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:52.560
No, I have to go to the field first, I have to roll a spliff,

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:56.560
and I have to work up that appetite to get to the junk food, so I'm going to go and smoke first.

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.560
Okay.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.560
You're going out, you're going out to smoke and you see an old man.

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:06.560
He says, start snacking healthy with Nature Box.

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:15.560
So, I think it's, let's put it at Quark's turn.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.560
Sorry, what?

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:22.560
You're eating junk food in the junk food village.

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.560
Okay.

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:24.560
What was the name again?

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.560
Diem.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:28.560
Diem has just gone off to roll a spliff.

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.560
Okay.

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:33.560
I kind of want to stick around for the junk food, it's been a while since I could eat it.

01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.560
I don't want to take some imaginary junk food.

01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:36.560
All right.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:39.560
Well, as you're eating that, an old man, the same old man, you wouldn't know that,

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:44.560
an old man comes up and says, Nature Box makes snacks that actually taste great

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:49.560
and are better for you, created with high quality ingredients that are from artificial,

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:55.560
free of artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners, so you can feel great about snacking.

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.560
Well, that's hardly junk at all.

01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.560
That's absolutely true.

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:02.560
He hands you a Nature Box.

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:09.560
Your personal favorites are vanilla bean wafers and flan or fortune coins.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:12.560
Flan fortune coins.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.560
I take the vanilla bean wafers, is that what you said?

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:17.560
Right.

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:22.560
And I throw them at his character.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.560
Is that because I'm white and Hispanic?

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:26.560
Yes.

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:29.560
I'm a vanilla bean wafer.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.560
As you throw those coins.

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.560
It's because of your wordplay.

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:38.560
As you throw the coins, you realize that Nature Box has recently made their service even better.

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:43.560
You can order as much as you want, as often as you want, with no minimum purchase required

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:45.560
and you can cancel at any time.

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.560
The coins strike against his forehead.

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:51.560
You take free damage.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.560
There's no minimum purchase.

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:55.560
Come on.

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.560
Yeah.

01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.560
That fucking sucks.

01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:02.560
It's simple. Go to naturebox.com and check out the Snack Catalog.

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:07.560
There are over 100 snacks to choose from and they're constantly adding delicious new snacks.

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:11.560
Choose the snacks you want to deliver right to your door.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.560
Even with three damage, I can hardly afford not to.

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.560
You continue to eat from the healthy snacks of Nature Box

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.560
and you realize you'll never be bored.

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:30.560
It seems that there are new snacks each month inspired by real customer feedback

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:34.560
and if you ever try a snack you don't like, Nature Box, it will replace it for free.

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:37.560
That's a snack back guarantee, my friend.

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.560
Hey, Jane.

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:41.560
Jane, are you here?

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.560
Jane, did you come in to...

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:44.560
Jane, get up here.

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.560
The show's almost over.

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:46.560
What are you doing?

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:52.560
Yes, let's lose one of our gallbladder people, or both.

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:55.560
Let's just lose the gallbladder brothers.

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:56.560
The gallbladder brothers.

01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:57.560
Thank you.

01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:58.560
Thank you, sir.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:01.560
Thanks so much to Jared and Alex.

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:02.560
Thanks, man.

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:07.560
Jane, Jane, tell us about your Nature Box.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.560
I was told maybe the out is a little less hard than maybe yesterday.

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:17.560
Oh.

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:18.560
But I don't want to abuse it.

01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:20.560
But I still have to give him the Nature Box?

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:23.560
Because you told me you texted you, you're coming to town.

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:24.560
Yeah.

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:25.560
You weren't going to and then you made it.

01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:26.560
So how's it going?

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.560
This has been a hell of a show.

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:30.560
Oh, really?

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.560
Yeah.

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.560
It's been hilarious.

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.560
Wow, it's been a hell of a show?

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:34.560
It's been a hell of a show.

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:35.560
Wow.

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.560
And right now you'll save even more.

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.560
Nature Box is offering Harmontown fans 50% off your first order

That's naturebox.com slash Harmontown for 50% off your first order.

Well, that is good to know.

Naturebox.com slash Harmontown.

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.560
That is good to know because I haven't had dinner.

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:52.560
So what do you got for me?

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.560
Rocks fall, everybody dies.

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.560
Thank you.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.560
That has been D&D.

01:44:58.560 --> 01:44:59.560
I didn't get a character.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.560
I'm trying to.

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.560
I'm trying to.

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:02.560
I'm trying to.

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.560
I'm trying to.

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:06.560
Would you say you represent the transgender community when you say it was a great show?

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:07.560
Always.

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:08.560
Yes.

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:09.560
I am here completely as a.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:10.560
I'm trying to.

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:11.560
I don't know how to.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:12.560
Harmontown.com slash Nature Box.

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.560
I don't know how to.

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.560
Okay.

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:15.560
No.

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.560
The other way around.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:28.560
What do you need from me?

01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:33.560
Would it be accurate to say you called it transforific?

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.560
Transtastic.

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:40.560
Yeah.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.560
Which is the opposite of transphobic.

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:50.560
Would you call it Advocch brand?

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:52.560
Would you.

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:53.560
Would you call.

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.560
Would you call it Advocch.

01:45:55.560 --> 01:46:01.560
Advocchamazing.

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:04.560
Where more importantly, we'll put a bit in that.

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.560
How's it been going with you?

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.560
Is there any developments?

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:11.560
Is there anything in it?

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:15.280
as a human being, in your glass-blowing science.

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.920
Any, what's, where are you at?

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.000
We haven't heard from you in a while.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.840
Yeah, it's been, it's been quite a year, actually.

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:24.040
It's been a lot, a lot going on, a lot of good stuff.

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:26.840
It's been quite a year for everyone.

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:28.540
Why is, why is yours quite a year?

01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:33.720
I've, I hold his feet to the fireball.

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:35.760
She's, the, the.

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:37.400
Oh.

01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:38.640
You guys got me, you got me.

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:39.480
It's like a game show.

01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.080
Culture has become a game show.

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.600
There's a buzzer, and then I, yes, I hold,

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:46.680
holding her feet to the fire.

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:49.560
Well, it's been, it's been a lot of, of,

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.240
kind of spinning my wheels and trying to figure out

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:54.400
what's going on, really, and, and getting more comfortable

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:59.720
with the idea that, uh, trans isn't always,

01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:03.800
uh, the, the, the, the very word trans implies a binary,

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:06.200
as, as I was taught to use it.

01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:07.040
You're going from one thing to another.

01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:08.360
I'm going from one thing to another.

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:09.920
I'm going from one side of the binary

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:11.520
to the other side of the binary.

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.680
And what I'm finding out is I've sort of been on this journey

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:17.400
and it's like, you know, I, I, I, I can like stop in,

01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.640
where, where were we, uh, we were stopping in Kansas?

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:20.480
Yeah.

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:21.320
Omaha.

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.160
You're the Wichita.

01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:23.000
Wichita.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:23.840
Yeah.

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:24.680
I'm sort of in the Wichita of gender.

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:25.560
There's like, there's a fishing hole,

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:27.840
but also like, it's not mandatory.

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:28.680
Right.

01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:29.520
And it's not necessarily, yeah.

01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:30.360
It's not necessarily.

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.200
It's not why you're there.

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:32.040
It's not why you're there.

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:32.880
Maybe I'm actually closer up to Calgary or something.

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:33.720
Yeah.

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:35.200
Seven gin and tonic at the hotel bar.

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:36.040
Yeah.

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:38.760
And then you go on the hike. Yes.

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:39.600
Um.

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:42.320
Is that in your window?

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:43.160
Is that in your window?

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.000
It's not in your window.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:44.840
There we go.

01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:45.680
There we go.

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.680
Are there any Banff stories here?

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.160
I always like, when I go to like a hotel, I'm like,

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.640
oh, you're, you're staying in Dubai.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.720
I've never been in Dubai.

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.960
But, uh, like, but it's like, oh, you're in this way.

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:58.160
And then like, but it really like, if the hotel is like,

01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:00.120
oh, is there a place where I could just have a drink,

01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:03.600
like in the lobby, like, and do you have to feel bad?

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:05.840
Like, because there's always like a thing in the,

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:08.880
in the foyer that says like, you should go to the wonder spot.

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:11.640
And while you're here, don't forget to tour Al Capone's

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.040
Canyon and, and all this stuff.

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:14.880
And you're like, kind of like,

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:16.080
This is exactly like gender.

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:16.920
Yes.

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:19.400
This is, I'm reading it.

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:20.240
Go, go, go.

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.320
Well, there's a certain amount of shame to like,

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.520
like, like, like as a Western culture,

01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.880
like it's kind of like, make up your mind.

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.400
You know, what are you doing here?

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.240
It's exact.

01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:31.800
I mean, that is, I mean, really a lot of the last year

01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.640
has actually just been trying to understand,

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:36.800
trying to redefine what exactly gender is.

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:37.840
Getting to a point of,

01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:40.560
enough comfort that I can sort of step,

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.880
and it is comfort and it's a little bit of privilege

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.200
to have that comfort,

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:45.280
but to be able to sort of step-

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.760
Boom, privilege.

01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:48.080
Bob, privilege.

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:49.440
Well, yeah.

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.280
Wait.

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.880
Oh, privilege to be transgender.

01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:52.720
Yeah.

01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:56.240
Transgender privilege.

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:58.640
Or to be just non-binary gender.

01:48:58.640 --> 01:48:59.960
They all, and-

01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:00.800
Boom, yeah.

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.920
New terms and new, new three-letter acronym.

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:05.440
Boo to yay or booing.

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:08.160
Booing, yay, or brewing.

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:09.000
Brewing?

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.880
Boo, boo, yay, booze.

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.440
I'm booing the binary.

01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:15.680
Boo, boo.

01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:16.760
To the binary.

01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:17.600
Well.

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.560
Sure.

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.760
Do you have the fart?

01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:28.400
I know, I'm not, it would be a bad time to play, I don't think.

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.760
Or really, once I saw you feeling like your gender,

01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:34.920
I was like, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.760
Continue.

01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:37.840
Where was I now?

01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:42.760
Yeah, no, it's figuring out about culture,

01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.200
the very idea of gender is,

01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.600
we've talked about this before,

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.640
it's an emergent thing.

01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.800
It's something that really exists

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:54.760
within some sort of a matrix, some sort of a culture.

01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:57.760
And it's manifesting something physical.

01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:59.840
The fact that we have done,

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.960
that there's a binary on the sexual,

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:04.160
there's a binary on this does that to that,

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:05.280
and out comes that.

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.120
Trying to always overlay that in some sort of comfort,

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.160
in some sort of power structure,

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:13.720
and let's simplify things,

01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:15.560
well that does that,

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.000
so we're gonna call those those people,

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.960
and they tend to do that sort of thing.

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:21.200
Just stepping back from all of that,

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:23.920
and saying it doesn't have to be that way,

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.400
but it's going to be a pain,

01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:27.400
because it's going to be getting outside of the system,

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:28.480
it's gonna be getting outside of it,

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.000
it's gonna cause more energy.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.440
You never get to feel like the good person,

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.600
like the hero of the story,

01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:36.480
when you're disrupting.

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:40.600
Like not, there's a very few circumstances where that's,

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.480
and we see everybody flock to that,

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.920
when it's a matter of everybody just getting behind something,

01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:47.160
and hashtagging something, it's like, oh it's fun,

01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:49.440
like why not, there's a tree there,

01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:52.960
like it's standing, why shouldn't it be knocked over?

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:53.800
Like, oh I-

01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.560
Hey, remember when I said we had very little time left?

01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:00.600
But he said that we, it wasn't quite as hard of an out.

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.120
Yeah, he did say that, yeah.

01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:04.200
He did say that.

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:06.720
Would you characterize Spencer what you're doing right now

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:07.880
as transphobic?

01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:08.720
Yes.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.680
And it's time to transform this phobic

01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:14.520
into the end of the show.

01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:17.160
I'm Barclay Plein, NPR News.

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.480
All right.

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:19.320
Woo!

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.560
That's been our show everybody!

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:25.880
Thank you to Marley, thank you to Stephanie,

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:28.080
thank you to Jared, thank you to Alex,

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.120
I'm so sorry to Jane.

01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:32.960
I really, I don't know, they're flashing lights at me,

01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:33.800
I'm so sorry.

01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:35.000
Thanks for everyone's comfort,

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.320
Harmontown, Harmontown's out of session!

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.960
Drive fast, take chances!

01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:57.400
Thank you so much!

01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:59.880
Did you get any of that?

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:10.440
It's a good show!
