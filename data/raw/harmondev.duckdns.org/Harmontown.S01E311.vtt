{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.760\nThank you all for coming from MacArthur Park,\n\n00:10.760 --> 00:14.440\nLos Angeles, somewhere near downtown LA.\n\n00:14.440 --> 00:17.600\nOn a Monday night, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:17.600 --> 00:27.020\nLet's bring out the Game Master Spencer,\n\n00:27.020 --> 00:38.800\nCrittenden, and your Mayor, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:38.800 --> 00:49.800\nOh no, coming in hot.\n\n00:49.800 --> 00:55.400\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\n00:55.400 --> 00:56.660\nNothing.\n\n00:56.660 --> 01:00.180\nIs this my natural posture?\n\n01:00.180 --> 01:01.580\nI'm not sucking anything in.\n\n01:07.140 --> 01:10.140\nI just felt like I had a little bit of a cheeseburger\n\n01:10.140 --> 01:11.100\nslide in New York.\n\n01:11.100 --> 01:12.700\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:12.700 --> 01:13.660\nHip hop.\n\n01:13.660 --> 01:17.140\nOh, you've got to stop eating like a piece of shit\n\n01:17.140 --> 01:18.620\nif you want to be beaten.\n\n01:18.620 --> 01:21.220\nYou're weight into submission.\n\n01:21.220 --> 01:24.900\nI fucked your mama with my nocturnal emissions.\n\n01:24.900 --> 01:26.780\nAutopilot, they call it.\n\n01:26.780 --> 01:31.460\nI fucked her without even trying.\n\n01:31.460 --> 01:35.460\nI'm bored with your mama sexually.\n\n01:35.460 --> 01:37.180\nOh, damn.\n\n01:37.180 --> 01:38.340\nWow.\n\n01:38.340 --> 01:46.980\nIt took over 300 episodes, because finally tire of that.\n\n01:46.980 --> 01:48.980\nHoneymoon's over.\n\n01:48.980 --> 01:51.940\nYou and their mama had a pretty good run, I got to say.\n\n01:51.940 --> 01:54.660\nIt was the longest relationship with anything.\n\n01:54.660 --> 01:58.500\nOr any job or automobile, like I've never\n\n01:58.500 --> 02:03.500\ncommitted to anything longer than I have your mama.\n\n02:03.500 --> 02:07.180\nI wonder how many times you affect the mama's\n\n02:07.180 --> 02:08.540\nto the north and to the south.\n\n02:11.380 --> 02:13.060\nI don't know, three or four.\n\n02:13.060 --> 02:15.100\nIt seems like the kind of thing, and I wouldn't want\n\n02:15.100 --> 02:16.620\nto cause busy work for this person,\n\n02:16.620 --> 02:20.980\nbut I don't want to trigger any kind of disorder that\n\n02:20.980 --> 02:24.020\nneeds to not be triggered for someone to be happy.\n\n02:24.020 --> 02:26.900\nBut it seems like the kind of thing\n\n02:26.900 --> 02:29.300\nthat someone on the internet would just go through,\n\n02:29.300 --> 02:31.860\nand they would give us an accurate count on how many times\n\n02:31.860 --> 02:35.100\nthe phrase, fuck your mama, has been said.\n\n02:35.100 --> 02:36.180\nWhat do you think it would be?\n\n02:36.180 --> 02:37.980\nTake a jelly bean jar count.\n\n02:37.980 --> 02:39.620\nJust saying, I fucked your mama?\n\n02:39.620 --> 02:40.020\nYeah, yeah.\n\n02:40.020 --> 02:42.220\nOh, god.\n\n02:42.220 --> 02:46.100\nI would say 1,700 times.\n\n02:49.860 --> 02:51.300\nIt might be more than that.\n\n02:51.300 --> 02:55.300\nThat might be like a Price's Right, Bitter's Row, low ball.\n\n02:55.300 --> 02:58.900\nYou're going to say 1,701 and fucking win and get up there.\n\n02:58.900 --> 02:59.940\nWe won't go Price's, right?\n\n02:59.940 --> 03:02.620\nWe'll go distance from absolute.\n\n03:02.620 --> 03:03.820\nI'm guessing 1,700.\n\n03:03.820 --> 03:05.340\nI'm going to say 1,500.\n\n03:05.340 --> 03:07.380\nDoes anybody here have the aptitude for that sort of thing\n\n03:07.380 --> 03:10.180\nthat they think they know?\n\n03:10.180 --> 03:11.460\nThe aptitude for guessing?\n\n03:11.460 --> 03:12.540\nNo, no, no.\n\n03:12.540 --> 03:16.300\nSomebody, autism, autism.\n\n03:16.300 --> 03:20.340\nDoes anyone here have autism?\n\n03:20.340 --> 03:21.660\nI mean, does anybody have to think\n\n03:21.660 --> 03:24.300\nthat they would think much higher and much lower numbers?\n\n03:24.300 --> 03:27.460\nIt's got to be less than 300.\n\n03:27.460 --> 03:28.820\nIt's got to be less than 300?\n\n03:28.820 --> 03:29.460\nYeah.\n\n03:29.460 --> 03:31.380\nYou really think an episode's gone by without?\n\n03:31.380 --> 03:35.420\nSo let's say if you've wrapped half the episodes\n\n03:35.420 --> 03:39.660\nand in three-quarter of those you've mentioned it at all,\n\n03:39.660 --> 03:40.540\nthen that's what?\n\n03:40.540 --> 03:42.660\nLike 40% of the episodes.\n\n03:42.660 --> 03:45.500\nSo you would have to fuck them to the north and to the south\n\n03:45.500 --> 03:47.380\nthree times per rap.\n\n03:47.380 --> 03:48.060\nNo, Dan is saying just.\n\n03:48.060 --> 03:49.740\nNo, no, we're talking about just fucking your mama's\n\n03:49.740 --> 03:50.660\nin one rap.\n\n03:50.660 --> 03:53.020\nOK, so I thought this was about fucking them both\n\n03:53.020 --> 03:55.020\nin the north and the south.\n\n03:55.020 --> 03:56.740\nLook, I want all these numbers.\n\n03:56.740 --> 03:57.980\nEasily 2,000.\n\n03:57.980 --> 04:01.580\nI want to get all these numbers.\n\n04:01.580 --> 04:02.060\nHuh?\n\n04:02.060 --> 04:04.580\nNo, no, this is different.\n\n04:04.580 --> 04:05.660\nNo, but Dan.\n\n04:05.660 --> 04:08.980\nThat's why I didn't want to pollute this with the.\n\n04:08.980 --> 04:10.420\nBut these are the right questions.\n\n04:10.420 --> 04:12.780\nI just wanted to start with a baseline of how many.\n\n04:12.780 --> 04:15.740\nBecause yeah, because you'll fuck like seven mamas in one\n\n04:15.740 --> 04:17.740\nrap, then 300.\n\n04:17.740 --> 04:20.460\nIf I rap for two minutes, that's going to like be.\n\n04:20.460 --> 04:21.540\nSo at least 20.\n\n04:21.540 --> 04:25.460\nMy guess is an average of five times per the number\n\n04:25.460 --> 04:27.100\nof episodes, just because some episodes.\n\n04:27.100 --> 04:28.580\nSure, maybe I don't rap at all.\n\n04:28.580 --> 04:29.260\nThat's fair.\n\n04:29.260 --> 04:32.380\nAnd then, but then it's like, it is my crutch.\n\n04:32.380 --> 04:35.740\nThe only time I've done away with it would be the Mike Eagle\n\n04:35.740 --> 04:36.180\nepisode.\n\n04:36.180 --> 04:38.260\nAnd I probably did it 17 times.\n\n04:38.260 --> 04:39.700\nOtherwise, yeah.\n\n04:39.700 --> 04:41.980\nSo I'm going to say, actually, you know what?\n\n04:41.980 --> 04:43.340\nI think 1,500 is way too low.\n\n04:43.340 --> 04:44.140\nI think you're right.\n\n04:44.140 --> 04:45.140\nI'm going 1,700.\n\n04:45.140 --> 04:46.620\nI'm going to go 1,900.\n\n04:46.620 --> 04:47.340\nOK.\n\n04:47.340 --> 04:48.340\nI want to go, OK.\n\n04:48.340 --> 04:50.300\nSo who knows who can count that?\n\n04:50.300 --> 04:51.260\nMaybe somebody can.\n\n04:51.260 --> 04:56.380\nThese days, the last time I checked, they had Avid plug-ins.\n\n04:56.380 --> 04:58.700\nThis was still when I was working at community.\n\n04:58.700 --> 05:06.260\nI think Yahoo season, like Avid had this plug-in that,\n\n05:06.260 --> 05:10.540\nI can't remember what it was called, but you can type in\n\n05:10.540 --> 05:12.620\na word like butterfly.\n\n05:12.620 --> 05:15.780\nAnd it would go through all of the footage in the bins\n\n05:15.780 --> 05:19.100\nand bring up clips marked.\n\n05:19.100 --> 05:21.380\nAnd it would be like Donald Glover saying butterfly.\n\n05:21.380 --> 05:22.620\nChevy Chase saying butterfly.\n\n05:22.620 --> 05:26.700\nLike, you type in the word, and it would voice recognize\n\n05:26.700 --> 05:28.340\nwithout having to do it in real time.\n\n05:28.340 --> 05:31.780\nIt would just go scrub through all of the data instantly\n\n05:31.780 --> 05:38.260\nand bring up a list sorted by relevance or whatever.\n\n05:38.260 --> 05:41.060\nAnd at the top of the list, it was just like, holy shit.\n\n05:41.060 --> 05:43.140\nThis is everyone saying butterfly.\n\n05:43.140 --> 05:46.180\nAnd then there would be like a steep drop down to people\n\n05:46.180 --> 05:51.540\nsaying, give me a piece of peanut butter pie or something.\n\n05:51.540 --> 05:54.980\nBut it was amazing, which is also useful if you were going\n\n05:54.980 --> 05:58.060\nto edit a fucking mix or something.\n\n05:58.060 --> 06:01.860\nAnd now you'd have a thing that rhymes with butterfly.\n\n06:01.860 --> 06:02.940\nPeanut butter pie.\n\n06:02.940 --> 06:05.820\nI thought that was just incredible.\n\n06:05.820 --> 06:09.180\nEditing is, obviously, we don't wear little white gloves\n\n06:09.180 --> 06:11.820\nand splice tape anymore.\n\n06:11.820 --> 06:14.220\nBut beyond that leap to the digital,\n\n06:14.220 --> 06:17.860\nthere really hasn't been so few things that actually make it\n\n06:17.860 --> 06:19.900\na faster thing to edit, which has always\n\n06:19.900 --> 06:25.740\nbeen this sort of Promethean hybrid of engineering\n\n06:25.740 --> 06:28.500\nand artistry editing.\n\n06:28.500 --> 06:31.500\nAnd the idea that an AI could just\n\n06:31.500 --> 06:35.820\nbe like, pull up all those takes where they got their line\n\n06:35.820 --> 06:41.860\nright or whatever, which used to be the domain of man.\n\n06:41.860 --> 06:46.060\nAnd that is an intentionally exclusive statement.\n\n06:46.060 --> 06:47.460\nOnly male editors can.\n\n06:50.740 --> 07:00.460\nSpeaking of progress, Stanley has progressed off\n\n07:00.460 --> 07:04.020\nof the mortal realm, his mission accomplished.\n\n07:04.020 --> 07:06.020\nWas he 94 years old?\n\n07:06.020 --> 07:07.020\n95.\n\n07:07.020 --> 07:07.820\nWhat a life.\n\n07:07.820 --> 07:09.260\nDid you meet him?\n\n07:09.260 --> 07:13.860\nI met him, but it was like I met him in a line.\n\n07:13.860 --> 07:15.100\nRight, a lot of Comic-Con or something?\n\n07:15.100 --> 07:16.180\nYeah.\n\n07:16.180 --> 07:16.900\nYou weren't there for that?\n\n07:16.900 --> 07:17.260\nNo.\n\n07:17.260 --> 07:18.780\nOK, yeah, that was a Rick and Morty thing.\n\n07:18.780 --> 07:23.820\nMe and Justin, we went to Kamikaze, Stanley's Kamikaze,\n\n07:23.820 --> 07:27.060\nand he signed a thing.\n\n07:27.060 --> 07:31.980\nAnd it wasn't really like come party with Stanley.\n\n07:31.980 --> 07:36.340\nBut were you a fan of the DC stuff?\n\n07:40.340 --> 07:45.420\nI don't really care about that stuff at all, anyway, anymore.\n\n07:45.420 --> 07:47.380\nI'm tired.\n\n07:47.380 --> 07:55.140\nBut it's objectively notable that Stanley was obviously,\n\n07:55.140 --> 07:56.220\nI mean, wow, what a life.\n\n07:56.220 --> 08:01.540\nIt's just interesting to, not only\n\n08:01.540 --> 08:04.700\nwas he like, oh, we have him to thank for a bunch of shit\n\n08:04.700 --> 08:09.940\nthat we've been talking about for the last 25 years alone.\n\n08:09.940 --> 08:12.820\nBut the idea of living a life so complete\n\n08:12.820 --> 08:16.940\nthat in your way past your 80th year, which,\n\n08:16.940 --> 08:19.060\nif I make it past 80, I'm going to be like,\n\n08:19.060 --> 08:21.820\nI just imagine myself, all I'll be doing\n\n08:21.820 --> 08:26.940\nis it will be all pharmaceutical-based and paperwork\n\n08:26.940 --> 08:30.260\nand getting sued or whatever you do past 80.\n\n08:30.260 --> 08:32.540\nYou know, they're just fighting for the right\n\n08:32.540 --> 08:38.260\nto just sort of squat on Tara firmer.\n\n08:38.260 --> 08:43.620\nBut in his fight, I mean, he got to watch the thing\n\n08:43.620 --> 08:45.140\nthat in your biopic usually just has\n\n08:45.140 --> 08:50.020\nto happen in that one paragraph after the person\n\n08:50.020 --> 08:51.820\nthat the biopic's about dies.\n\n08:51.820 --> 08:54.100\nCharlie Chaplin goes away and then the paragraph says,\n\n08:54.100 --> 08:57.940\nand now today he's taught in universities and blah, blah,\n\n08:57.940 --> 09:00.460\nblah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n09:00.460 --> 09:03.380\nAnd you always have that feeling of, oh, that's a little sad.\n\n09:03.380 --> 09:06.740\nI wish Picasso or so and so could have been there\n\n09:06.740 --> 09:08.040\nfor that part.\n\n09:08.040 --> 09:10.060\nIt was kind of neat.\n\n09:10.060 --> 09:16.940\nHe got to, pretty sure he left after the credits of his biopic.\n\n09:16.940 --> 09:17.820\nHe's probably like, you know what,\n\n09:17.820 --> 09:20.460\nif I stick around for 10 more minutes,\n\n09:20.460 --> 09:23.820\nsomething awful is going to happen.\n\n09:23.820 --> 09:25.940\nHe really nailed it.\n\n09:25.940 --> 09:32.940\nThere was right at the end there, wasn't there a weird fracas, something about him suing\n\n09:32.940 --> 09:41.460\nhis manager, or there was some kind of, I don't know, I hope it was a legitimate.\n\n09:41.460 --> 09:44.860\nWait, so he was suing his nurse and then he just conveniently dies?\n\n09:44.860 --> 09:45.860\nUh-oh.\n\n09:45.860 --> 09:47.660\nI don't even, I mean.\n\n09:47.660 --> 09:52.300\nReported here first, Harmontown Exclusive Scoop.\n\n09:52.300 --> 09:57.380\nI heard that he didn't really get to do any of the comics or Fantastic Four or any of\n\n09:57.380 --> 10:00.980\nthe comics he got known to for until he was 40 years old.\n\n10:00.980 --> 10:07.260\nSo it's not just like, oh, he was an intrepid young, he was a 40 year old man and then his\n\n10:07.260 --> 10:08.260\nlife started.\n\n10:08.260 --> 10:13.500\nYeah, that's good, I'm glad you pointed that out, because it's like, what can we learn\n\n10:13.500 --> 10:18.980\nfrom people, because otherwise the message becomes as bland as like, oh, I hope I get\n\n10:18.980 --> 10:22.220\nto do stuff, that must have been nice for him.\n\n10:22.220 --> 10:29.860\nBut yeah, I, you know, a lot of people email me or hopefully a lot of people don't have\n\n10:29.860 --> 10:35.700\nmy email, but, you know, Tumblr messages and whatever, people that slide into my DMs or\n\n10:35.700 --> 10:46.060\nwhat, people, there's a theme among the things that people ask me called, am I too old to\n\n10:46.060 --> 10:48.420\ntry to start doing what you're doing?\n\n10:48.420 --> 10:56.100\nIf I've been up until now a plumber or an exterminator or a bicycle thief.\n\n10:56.100 --> 11:01.500\nAnd of course we know that fashionably you're supposed to say, absolutely not, you're never\n\n11:01.500 --> 11:02.500\ntoo old.\n\n11:02.500 --> 11:09.900\nBut I actually believe that, you know, you have to start when you're 20, no, I'm kidding.\n\n11:09.900 --> 11:15.660\nNo, I mean, I truly believe it's so important to keep that in mind and such a great example\n\n11:15.660 --> 11:21.820\nbecause he was basically, it's like, hey, guess what, the TV writing business got sued\n\n11:21.820 --> 11:24.580\nfor it and I don't know if they even cleaned up their act, there's ageism.\n\n11:24.580 --> 11:29.540\nLike in existing industries, these existing channels, let the kids ask, how do I do it,\n\n11:29.540 --> 11:31.420\nhow did they do it yesterday?\n\n11:31.420 --> 11:36.660\nBut the blessing and curse of maybe feeling like you're too long in the tooth to strike\n\n11:36.660 --> 11:41.420\nout and do something is that you almost got no choice but to, you know, carve out your\n\n11:41.420 --> 11:42.420\nown niche.\n\n11:42.420 --> 11:46.580\nLike, but absolutely, I mean, it's like, he's not known for that.\n\n11:46.580 --> 11:52.740\nIt's not like, it's not like his eulogy on ABC News today is going to be known as the\n\n11:52.740 --> 11:56.060\nlate starter Stanley Brano.\n\n11:56.060 --> 12:00.940\nBut yeah, I mean, it's probably was a huge factor in his life that he had to think about\n\n12:00.940 --> 12:05.980\nall the time from 32 to 40, you know, like, what the fuck am I doing?\n\n12:05.980 --> 12:11.820\nHow many times do you think he maybe thought, why am I drawing sequential pictures of a guy\n\n12:11.820 --> 12:12.820\nclaiming a wall?\n\n12:12.820 --> 12:15.100\nThis is never, I got to stop this.\n\n12:15.100 --> 12:20.500\nThis is not going to go anywhere other than the wall.\n\n12:20.500 --> 12:21.500\nDo we have Schrabs?\n\n12:21.500 --> 12:22.500\nI don't know.\n\n12:22.500 --> 12:23.500\nIt's his birthday.\n\n12:23.500 --> 12:24.500\nIt's his birthday.\n\n12:24.500 --> 12:25.500\nWhy would he come here?\n\n12:25.500 --> 12:26.500\nHappy birthday, Schrab.\n\n12:26.500 --> 12:27.500\nHappy birthday, Schrab.\n\n12:27.500 --> 12:28.500\nOh, yeah.\n\n12:28.500 --> 12:32.100\nHe's still not here, though.\n\n12:32.100 --> 12:33.100\nYeah, I know.\n\n12:33.100 --> 12:34.260\nI love, I love the Rob shop.\n\n12:34.260 --> 12:35.500\nI'm glad he's not here on his birthday.\n\n12:35.500 --> 12:37.380\nThat would be incredibly depressing.\n\n12:37.380 --> 12:38.580\nYou also invited him.\n\n12:38.580 --> 12:39.580\nI did.\n\n12:39.580 --> 12:40.580\nBut I was, I'm glad.\n\n12:40.580 --> 12:41.580\nNot that glad.\n\n12:41.580 --> 12:42.580\nI'm not heave that call.\n\n12:42.580 --> 12:43.580\nWell, I'm glad he's not here either.\n\n12:43.580 --> 12:44.580\nWell, I'm glad he's not here either.\n\n12:44.580 --> 12:50.060\nOn the chance that the truth would be more depressing, like, he's happy to find out that\n\n12:50.060 --> 12:51.700\nhe had something better to do.\n\n12:51.700 --> 12:52.700\nYeah.\n\n12:52.700 --> 12:59.860\nWhat do they say, pray for, pray for sunshine, prepare for rain?\n\n12:59.860 --> 13:00.860\nSomething like that.\n\n13:00.860 --> 13:01.860\nI don't know.\n\n13:01.860 --> 13:02.860\nI think I coined it.\n\n13:02.860 --> 13:06.460\nHow was your New York experience?\n\n13:06.460 --> 13:10.580\nI know, there's a story that happened in New York that is going to drop on the next episode\n\n13:10.580 --> 13:11.580\nafter this one.\n\n13:11.580 --> 13:12.580\nOh, really?\n\n13:12.580 --> 13:13.580\nYeah.\n\n13:13.580 --> 13:17.660\nIt's going to come out like during the week we're off around Thanksgiving.\n\n13:17.660 --> 13:20.780\nThings went a little hairy on the way to New York City.\n\n13:20.780 --> 13:22.820\nAnd not what they're recording.\n\n13:22.820 --> 13:23.820\nYeah.\n\n13:23.820 --> 13:24.820\nLike, they're recording.\n\n13:24.820 --> 13:29.580\nI talked about, we talked about nothing but, because I said in New York, I said, look,\n\n13:29.580 --> 13:34.580\nwe're either going to, if we talk, if we start talking about our trip to New York, that'll\n\n13:34.580 --> 13:36.540\nbe the entire 90 minute show.\n\n13:36.540 --> 13:39.300\nLet's just say, I became Joey Ramone.\n\n13:39.300 --> 13:44.780\nAnd Cody became Sid and Nancy.\n\n13:44.780 --> 13:50.940\nJoey Ramone was famously known for falling asleep outside.\n\n13:50.940 --> 13:54.020\nWe were over-served, is the headline.\n\n13:54.020 --> 13:55.020\nYou got to check out the episode.\n\n13:55.020 --> 13:56.020\nIt'll be a really good one.\n\n13:56.020 --> 13:57.020\nWe know you guys are famous for listening to the podcast.\n\n13:57.020 --> 13:58.020\nI'm still so ashamed of myself.\n\n13:58.020 --> 13:59.020\nIt's the worst.\n\n13:59.020 --> 14:00.020\nYeah.\n\n14:00.020 --> 14:08.860\nBut, and I think I was real drunk when I said it, but I babbled a little bit at the end,\n\n14:08.860 --> 14:14.100\nbecause I didn't want it to just be a maypole dance around people getting drunk and having\n\n14:14.100 --> 14:16.020\nembarrassing things happen to them.\n\n14:16.020 --> 14:23.980\nI want, I don't want to repeat myself for that episode, but this is going to be a recurring\n\n14:23.980 --> 14:29.340\ntheme now after going through a year of sorting through a bunch of shit.\n\n14:29.340 --> 14:35.300\nMy new thing is, got to be vulnerable, got to be honest, got to be transparent, got to\n\n14:35.300 --> 14:42.260\njust, even though there is this increasing pressure from a reaction chamber, this world\n\n14:42.260 --> 14:48.140\nthat we're voluntarily or not transitioning into, we're becoming these digital creatures\n\n14:48.140 --> 14:51.140\nand we can't have that digital world be a place of shame.\n\n14:51.140 --> 14:52.860\nThat can't rule the day.\n\n14:52.860 --> 14:56.620\nDid you guys see this, the Trumpy Bear ad thing?\n\n14:56.620 --> 14:57.620\nYeah.\n\n14:57.620 --> 14:58.620\nTrumpy Bear.\n\n14:58.620 --> 15:06.500\nDo you know what, so no then, there was this ad aired on Fox News for Trumpy Bear, seemed\n\n15:06.500 --> 15:11.580\nlike it was a joke, it was like it could have been an onion produced commercial for Trumpy\n\n15:11.580 --> 15:12.580\nBear.\n\n15:12.580 --> 15:14.980\nIt had the unmistakable tone, a little bit of a sketch.\n\n15:14.980 --> 15:20.140\nEven the act, like even the on-screen actors that were like using it just seemed like they\n\n15:20.140 --> 15:25.100\nwere doing it as a joke, it has a flat blanket inside of it.\n\n15:25.100 --> 15:31.820\nSo you open it, and you can pull out an American flag blanket out of its tummy and curl up\n\n15:31.820 --> 15:33.220\nwith Trumpy Bear.\n\n15:33.220 --> 15:34.700\nAnd it comes with a certificate.\n\n15:34.700 --> 15:39.140\nAnd there's a dude on a motorcycle, like a big Harley's Angel, Harley's Angel, what\n\n15:39.140 --> 15:40.140\nthe fuck is that?\n\n15:40.140 --> 15:44.540\nA house angel, Harley guy, driving around with a teddy bear talking about, yeah, I've\n\n15:44.540 --> 15:45.820\ngot my Trumpy Bear.\n\n15:45.820 --> 15:48.580\nTrumpy Bear's my bro or something.\n\n15:48.580 --> 15:51.420\nIt seems like a joke, have we verified that it's for real?\n\n15:51.420 --> 15:54.260\nNo, we've just mused idly about it.\n\n15:54.260 --> 15:59.220\nThe reason I bring it up is because I looked at it and I was like, my sincere optimistic\n\n15:59.220 --> 16:08.580\nhope here is that this is Nathan Fielder or John Oliver that we're gonna find out a couple\n\n16:08.580 --> 16:10.580\nmonths from now.\n\n16:10.580 --> 16:19.660\nOr someone doing that, because if it is, that's ingenious because, and then that kind of made\n\n16:19.660 --> 16:23.540\nme realize how much we need that, whether this is that or not.\n\n16:23.540 --> 16:28.620\nLike that has been my continued frustration that to the extent that you view our country\n\n16:28.620 --> 16:33.700\nas being in any kind of like battle between two sides, it's your choice if you don't want\n\n16:33.700 --> 16:34.700\nto see it that way.\n\n16:34.700 --> 16:35.700\nI understand that.\n\n16:35.700 --> 16:40.700\nYou're a Harmontown audience and I've been that guy for more longer than I've been this\n\n16:40.700 --> 16:44.900\npick-as-side guy, wouldn't force anything on you.\n\n16:44.900 --> 16:52.860\nBut if you do perceive this kind of like two-sided thing, the next thing you might perceive to\n\n16:52.860 --> 17:00.660\nyour frustration is that when did we, if we are the left, when did we become the ones\n\n17:00.660 --> 17:05.020\nthat aren't funny?\n\n17:05.020 --> 17:08.500\nBecause that's how we started for sure.\n\n17:08.500 --> 17:17.620\nThere's nothing funny or smart about the views that are held by that other side.\n\n17:17.620 --> 17:22.060\nTherefore what a crime it is that they're the trolls, that they're the ones doing the\n\n17:22.060 --> 17:29.220\nbits and the practical jokes and the stunts and it's like we got to get that scepter\n\n17:29.220 --> 17:36.660\nback where we should be having orgies in the street and making jokes that they don't understand\n\n17:36.660 --> 17:43.180\nand high-fiving each other for being misunderstood and ununderstandable and we should be able\n\n17:43.180 --> 17:48.540\nto stand side by side with people that we don't even get but we know that we want them\n\n17:48.540 --> 17:54.820\nto have a right to not be gotten and to the point where the only way to be on that other\n\n17:54.820 --> 18:01.660\nside is to be either silent and ashamed or loud and embarrassing to those other people\n\n18:01.660 --> 18:08.540\nthat are silent and that's where you want your foes, otherwise you're just awash in\n\n18:08.540 --> 18:16.100\nthis thing that then our beautiful, you know, kind of somewhere caught in the middle people,\n\n18:16.100 --> 18:19.780\nthey get that luxury of going like, I don't see any difference between you guys and that's\n\n18:19.780 --> 18:25.900\nwhen we lose big time, you lose that big giant middle of people that are like, I'm tired\n\n18:25.900 --> 18:30.140\nof this shit, I'm tired of listening to mom and dad bitch at each other, I can't see any\n\n18:30.140 --> 18:31.700\ndifference between you.\n\n18:31.700 --> 18:36.380\nYou're both just so ashamed of yourselves and afraid of each other and trying to convince\n\n18:36.380 --> 18:40.940\nsomebody of something that's not true and you're both lying and you're both politicking\n\n18:40.940 --> 18:46.980\nand it's like our great revolutions and our great victories against fascism have always\n\n18:46.980 --> 18:55.300\ncome down to how can you fight organic freedom, how can you fight sexuality, how can you fight\n\n18:55.300 --> 19:00.340\npoetry, how can you fight humor, how can you fight music, there's nothing to get your hands\n\n19:00.340 --> 19:02.140\naround, there's no throat there.\n\n19:02.140 --> 19:04.780\nBut yeah, it's a culture war.\n\n19:04.780 --> 19:09.980\nWe got those socialist gritty memes now though.\n\n19:09.980 --> 19:14.620\nThat's like the first positive step we've taken ever.\n\n19:14.620 --> 19:19.020\nBut I think it would be amazing and relatively hard, it wouldn't be dirty combat to be like,\n\n19:19.020 --> 19:24.620\nhey, here's this Trumpy bear and make them all buy a thing, then reveal to them three\n\n19:24.620 --> 19:30.740\nmonths later that all of that money went to black scholarships or abortions or whatever\n\n19:30.740 --> 19:36.820\nand then they have to like take it down from the gun rack in their bar and either burn\n\n19:36.820 --> 19:40.420\nit, but it's got an American flag in it.\n\n19:40.420 --> 19:44.820\nIsn't there like a little caveat on the thing that says...\n\n19:44.820 --> 19:47.460\nThere's a disclaimer people were pointing out and there's another website or whatever\n\n19:47.460 --> 19:53.780\nbecause it's a real thing, but the question is, is it a real thing that's kind of a cynically\n\n19:53.780 --> 19:57.140\njovial right thing, which wouldn't be the first time.\n\n19:57.140 --> 19:58.140\nI mean, they've gotten...\n\n19:58.140 --> 19:59.140\nOh yeah, they've gotten so hard too.\n\n19:59.140 --> 20:00.140\nYou can tell who's kidding anymore.\n\n20:00.140 --> 20:03.420\nThey sell mugs and shit.\n\n20:03.420 --> 20:08.140\nBut it's either that or it does say, there's like this very specific caveat about you can't\n\n20:08.140 --> 20:12.340\nreturn this damaged and it's sort of like, I don't know.\n\n20:12.340 --> 20:23.020\nOh, see, it's got to be a graft, a put-on, a Trojan bear.\n\n20:23.020 --> 20:28.700\nIf you watch the ad, truly the actors do seem like they're kind of like trying to be like\n\n20:28.700 --> 20:29.700\nalmost jokey.\n\n20:29.700 --> 20:30.700\nI don't know.\n\n20:30.700 --> 20:31.700\nIt really rides the line.\n\n20:31.700 --> 20:37.260\nThey're having a good time, but let's say it's real, they're gonna sell a lot of those\n\n20:37.260 --> 20:38.260\nTrumpy bears.\n\n20:38.260 --> 20:41.260\nYeah, well, you don't put an ad on the television if you're gonna sell it.\n\n20:41.260 --> 20:42.260\nLet's say it's fake.\n\n20:42.260 --> 20:45.460\nThey'd be stupid to not sell a million Trumpy bears and use that money for it.\n\n20:45.460 --> 20:47.100\nNo, they're definitely selling something.\n\n20:47.100 --> 20:50.580\nYou can't just put on a TV, it costs a lot of money, Jeff.\n\n20:50.580 --> 20:51.580\nYeah.\n\n20:51.580 --> 20:55.980\nHow much does a Trumpy bear go for, Spencer, do you know?\n\n20:55.980 --> 20:57.980\nTwo payments of $19.95.\n\n20:57.980 --> 20:58.980\nTwo payments.\n\n20:58.980 --> 20:59.980\nTwo payments.\n\n20:59.980 --> 21:01.980\nTwo payments.\n\n21:01.980 --> 21:02.980\nWow.\n\n21:02.980 --> 21:04.980\nAnd like a build a bear as well, like 30 bucks, 20 bucks.\n\n21:04.980 --> 21:05.980\nOkay.\n\n21:05.980 --> 21:06.980\nI don't know.\n\n21:06.980 --> 21:10.980\nLevy pointed out that we haven't yet to talk about Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\n21:10.980 --> 21:12.980\nYeah, no shit, Levy.\n\n21:12.980 --> 21:17.900\nIt brought to mind this text message exchange that I just had with Cody today.\n\n21:17.900 --> 21:24.380\nNow, before I go into this, I really want you to understand that I'm one of the people\n\n21:24.380 --> 21:26.940\nwho thinks this is a masterpiece of a video game.\n\n21:26.940 --> 21:34.220\nSo I know how flamed up we get about our video game culture.\n\n21:34.220 --> 21:35.220\nThat was a good movie.\n\n21:35.220 --> 21:36.220\nThat was a bad movie.\n\n21:36.220 --> 21:42.140\nIt looked like a fucking Civil War reenactment compared to Vietnam, like the way that people\n\n21:42.140 --> 21:45.700\nare like, you're wrong, it's a bad game.\n\n21:45.700 --> 21:50.940\nSo I feel like the need to disclaim this and go, I'm a fan of the game because I was just\n\n21:50.940 --> 21:52.820\ndoing a bit for myself.\n\n21:52.820 --> 21:59.980\nBecause Cody sent me a tweet, a picture of a tweet from a guy that tweeted, gave up on\n\n21:59.980 --> 22:03.340\nRed Dead Redemption 2 because I couldn't figure out which horse was mine.\n\n22:03.340 --> 22:07.620\nFuck this game.\n\n22:07.620 --> 22:12.460\nSo I texted Cody back, all he has to do is whistle and his horse would walk up to him.\n\n22:12.460 --> 22:13.460\nFuck that guy.\n\n22:13.460 --> 22:17.860\nYeah, I just learned you can like put, you can tie someone up and put them on the back\n\n22:17.860 --> 22:22.260\nof their own horse and then, or no, put them on the back of your horse, then get on their\n\n22:22.260 --> 22:26.100\nhorse and ride their horse and whistle for your horse to follow behind you.\n\n22:26.100 --> 22:29.660\nAnd then you can carry a deer on the back of your horse too.\n\n22:29.660 --> 22:32.900\nEveryone wins, except for the person tied up.\n\n22:32.900 --> 22:34.580\nIs there a button that says whistle?\n\n22:34.580 --> 22:35.780\nOh yeah, there's a button.\n\n22:35.780 --> 22:36.780\nIt's the up button.\n\n22:36.780 --> 22:38.260\nYou know the button that says whistle, don't you?\n\n22:38.260 --> 22:45.980\nIt's just the button that puts your lips together and the button that blows.\n\n22:45.980 --> 22:49.100\nThat was a nice, that was a nice to have and have not referenced.\n\n22:49.100 --> 22:57.100\nThe reference is so old that we get it because if it survived these many sandstorms, we all,\n\n22:57.100 --> 23:00.940\noh no, it's not like, yeah, okay.\n\n23:00.940 --> 23:04.500\nHow many buttons we got in this thing if there's a whistle button on the controller?\n\n23:04.500 --> 23:07.580\nYou know, there's a controller, there's like 90 fucking buttons.\n\n23:07.580 --> 23:17.060\nSo Cody made the mistake of typing, ha, ha, and so now I got a nickel in me and I, well,\n\n23:17.060 --> 23:19.420\nwhat a provocative asshole she is.\n\n23:19.420 --> 23:20.780\nNo, no, that's not.\n\n23:20.780 --> 23:24.580\nSo I texted, the reason he should give up is because it takes five attempts to stand\n\n23:24.580 --> 23:28.860\nin front of a biscuit the way that lets you pick it up.\n\n23:28.860 --> 23:31.540\nAnd she texted, ha, okay, I go back to sleep.\n\n23:31.540 --> 23:32.540\nCome cuddle soon.\n\n23:32.540 --> 23:35.620\nHarvey's saving your spot for you, which is her saying, you know, enough.\n\n23:35.620 --> 23:41.780\nSo I kind of like, I was like, it'd be funny if I kept going.\n\n23:41.780 --> 23:45.140\nHe should give up because the missions require you to slaughter entire towns, but if you\n\n23:45.140 --> 23:48.620\naccidentally press the fart button while you're tipping your hat, your honor goes down and\n\n23:48.620 --> 23:51.700\nammunition costs more.\n\n23:51.700 --> 23:55.260\nHe should give up because if, if you kill a man that tries to kill you and another man\n\n23:55.260 --> 23:59.380\nsees you do it, you have to run and make the third man pinky swear not to share his experience\n\n23:59.380 --> 24:03.700\nwith his family over dinner, because if you just kill him, the price of bacon goes up.\n\n24:03.700 --> 24:06.540\nAnd if you just ignore him, he instantly tells the world you're a murderer and that\n\n24:06.540 --> 24:11.020\nmeans you have to go to the post office.\n\n24:11.020 --> 24:12.020\nIt's true.\n\n24:12.020 --> 24:13.020\nYeah.\n\n24:13.020 --> 24:15.380\nIt doesn't sound like bits.\n\n24:15.380 --> 24:16.380\nIt's true.\n\n24:16.380 --> 24:17.380\nI don't know if you can buy bacon in the game.\n\n24:17.380 --> 24:18.380\nThat's the only thing that's not true.\n\n24:18.380 --> 24:22.460\nI tried to pick up a dead person's hat and I put it on and it was like, this hat will\n\n24:22.460 --> 24:23.620\nnot be saved.\n\n24:23.620 --> 24:25.020\nThis is not your default hat.\n\n24:25.020 --> 24:30.660\nAnd I was like, you told me to pick up the hat.\n\n24:30.660 --> 24:34.500\nThere's almost only one reason he shouldn't give up on Red Dead Redemption two.\n\n24:34.500 --> 24:37.180\nAnd that reason is because you can't find your horse.\n\n24:37.180 --> 24:40.060\nYou can only find your horse in that game.\n\n24:40.060 --> 24:44.660\nThere's a mind reading homing horse that can teleport to the bottom of cliffs.\n\n24:44.660 --> 24:49.580\nHere are some things that are harder to find than your horse in Red Dead Redemption two.\n\n24:49.580 --> 24:56.100\nYour clothes, your friends, your objectives, a satchel with room for more than nine things,\n\n24:56.100 --> 25:02.380\na way to survive without carrying nine pieces of food, a bowl of stew, your own left leg\n\n25:02.380 --> 25:08.020\nwhile taking a bath, the guy that keeps moaning in the hotel in the town of Valentine, a way\n\n25:08.020 --> 25:12.820\nto fuck any of the 26 workers in the saloon that compulsively ask you if you want some\n\n25:12.820 --> 25:17.820\ncompany every time you walk by them, interactions with random men that don't force you to choose\n\n25:17.820 --> 25:22.340\nbetween beating the fuck out of them or walking away while they call you a pussy, treasure\n\n25:22.340 --> 25:28.420\nmaps that function more like maps than Pictionary with an autistic child, a way to win a gunfight\n\n25:28.420 --> 25:33.180\nwith more than two men that doesn't involve running away and sneaking back seven times,\n\n25:33.180 --> 25:38.860\nany recourse whatsoever to role-playing as anything other than a sad, drunk, confused,\n\n25:38.860 --> 25:43.700\npsychotic, wobbling through mud, slurring at everyone or hiding in the wilderness, mutilating\n\n25:43.700 --> 25:48.380\nanimals in the pathetic hope that if you cut enough skin off, enough deer, you might be\n\n25:48.380 --> 25:52.060\nable to pick up enough motor function to walk from one end of a room to the other without\n\n25:52.060 --> 25:54.700\naccidentally dying or killing.\n\n25:54.700 --> 25:57.540\nWell now I want to go home and play somewhere because I just remembered how awesome this\n\n25:57.540 --> 26:09.300\ngame is. It's good. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Okay, come home now, please. I got to work more,\n\n26:09.300 --> 26:17.300\nsorry. I did, I had to work more. Damn. Did you? Well, not as hard as I did on that.\n\n26:17.300 --> 26:22.700\nI had this, like one of the last things I did, because the game kind of puts these random\n\n26:22.700 --> 26:28.940\nevents in front of you, and so it's these two lawmen are pulling a wagon with a prisoner\n\n26:28.940 --> 26:33.900\nand just between you and me, the prisoner is like an older black woman, and she's saying\n\n26:33.900 --> 26:38.380\nlike, I didn't do it. I didn't do anything. I'm innocent. And so I'm like, well, the game\n\n26:38.380 --> 26:42.780\nis telling me I got to save this lady. And so I sneak up on him and I shoot him both\n\n26:42.780 --> 26:46.780\nin the head, and I'm trying to, I'm trying to hide the bodies because, you know, I don't\n\n26:46.780 --> 26:51.740\nwant to go get in trouble. And so then another cop comes and I shoot him and then I'm like,\n\n26:51.740 --> 26:55.420\nwell, I'm just going to let this lady out and run away. And then, so then three more\n\n26:55.420 --> 26:59.300\ncops come and I get a big firefight and I kill like four horses on accident. It's a whole\n\n26:59.300 --> 27:03.940\nnightmare. I have like a $40 bounty on my head. And then I finally let the old lady out and\n\n27:03.940 --> 27:08.780\nshe's like, thank you so much. By the way, sonny, there's this old turnip farm down\n\n27:08.780 --> 27:13.220\nsouth that you can rob. And I was like, what the fuck is all these, all these, yeah, everyone,\n\n27:13.220 --> 27:18.380\nall these missions, like there's a robbery opportunity. Yeah. It's weird. You know what\n\n27:18.380 --> 27:23.340\nit's weird because I never, I was never confused in a Grand Theft Auto game. No, because everyone\n\n27:23.340 --> 27:29.300\nsucks. Right. And that was arguably, you know, it's hard culturally and let alone\n\n27:29.300 --> 27:34.180\nthat and with the with gaming is the fucking epicenter of this like crazy cultural like\n\n27:34.180 --> 27:43.660\nthe fucking tea cup ride that we've been on. But you know, obviously like like Rockstar\n\n27:43.660 --> 27:48.260\nGames in Grand Theft Auto was like this thing was like, hey, it's gaming, it's its own medium.\n\n27:48.260 --> 27:54.180\nNot only are we not accountable to standards and practices, we're not accountable to like\n\n27:54.180 --> 28:00.660\nany like constructs of morality that even the individual human might have, which you\n\n28:00.660 --> 28:06.260\nknow, I like like, I understand why people would get alarmed of that later being encroached\n\n28:06.260 --> 28:12.820\nupon. I don't know how how much thought the people that get mad put into it. But I I do\n\n28:12.820 --> 28:21.060\nremember going, boy, this is this is really actually very valuable latitude to have a medium\n\n28:21.060 --> 28:26.300\nin a world where we're such a successful first world empire that our television shows, even\n\n28:26.300 --> 28:30.580\nthough they've progressed from someone's got to keep their foot on the floor or if they're\n\n28:30.580 --> 28:35.100\nin the bedroom together to being able to look at two people wearing pajamas in a bed next\n\n28:35.100 --> 28:39.380\nto each other. Let you know, let's let's, you know, we're in danger of stagnation when\n\n28:39.380 --> 28:44.460\nwe get successful and our media becomes another product like eggs on a shelf that's like so\n\n28:44.460 --> 28:52.860\nsafe and so policed that, you know, it's like how you get conditioned to react to restrictive\n\n28:52.860 --> 28:59.460\nthought, but you know, or anomalous thought with, you know, pulling back. And that's all\n\n28:59.460 --> 29:04.140\nI so so I remember playing Grand Theft Auto three and being like, this is valuable. It's\n\n29:04.140 --> 29:11.180\ncynical. It's awful. It's so cynical. Right. But it's so it's a it's it's it's valuable\n\n29:11.180 --> 29:18.540\nthat it's expansive and well being so fucking poisonous. And it's equally poisonous to absolutely\n\n29:18.540 --> 29:24.340\neverything about society. Exactly. And it's consistent. And it was just sort of like, you\n\n29:24.340 --> 29:28.620\nknow, it was that whole like freedom of speech is way more fucking important than than anything\n\n29:28.620 --> 29:34.580\nbecause through that, if you lose that, you're certainly fucked no matter how good you think\n\n29:34.580 --> 29:41.540\nyou are as a society. And and and and I mean, that's a that's so long ago now and it's weird\n\n29:41.540 --> 29:46.140\nto think of it as long ago because that game was so relatively like I just still think\n\n29:46.140 --> 29:51.500\nof it as like a recent accomplishment that this Grand Theft Auto three represented this\n\n29:51.500 --> 29:58.860\nlike gigantic kind of leap forward in sandbox open world gaming. And it's so anyways, but\n\n29:58.860 --> 30:03.100\nand then I don't even want to comment because it's such a minefield of like how then we\n\n30:03.100 --> 30:11.100\nkeep making Grand Theft Auto games and and like even better ones through an era where\n\n30:11.100 --> 30:16.100\nlike, you know, this Gamergate shit starts happening and people are having these conversations\n\n30:16.100 --> 30:21.660\nabout what what what cultures are we promoting and why are you mad? Why are you mad? Why\n\n30:21.660 --> 30:24.300\nare you mad? What are you trying to protect? I'm not trying to protect any way you're trying\n\n30:24.300 --> 30:27.060\nto attack it. I didn't attack anything. Why are you trying to keep everything the same?\n\n30:27.060 --> 30:33.940\nI'm not trying to keep shit the same. I want them to do but she's a slut. But it's amazing\n\n30:33.940 --> 30:40.340\nto me that that that you know, it's like they had the Old West version of Grand Theft Auto\n\n30:40.340 --> 30:46.300\nRed Dead Redemption that this is seven years in the making the sequel to that to that game.\n\n30:46.300 --> 30:49.900\nAnd it's just so it's it's interesting to look at the tightrope that they're walking\n\n30:49.900 --> 30:54.380\nthe complete difference in like morals. But I think it's a little confusing because I\n\n30:54.380 --> 30:58.780\nthink it's very confusing. I wouldn't want them to you know what the most moral thing\n\n30:58.780 --> 31:03.460\nyou can do in Red Dead Redemption is shooting people in the foot and then tying them up\n\n31:03.460 --> 31:08.820\nand leaving them in the bushes. That's completely legal. No one will ever follow you for doing\n\n31:08.820 --> 31:12.660\nthat. What is the come up the come up into like if you get caught by the oh you have\n\n31:12.660 --> 31:16.540\nto pay $40 to the post office, you go to the post office and you pay your thing in Grand\n\n31:16.540 --> 31:23.540\nTheft Auto. It's not confusing. $40 is a lot of money, Jeff. It's not fucking 2018 in\n\n31:23.540 --> 31:28.180\nGrand Theft Auto. You're always in a car. You do something wrong. You get a wanted you\n\n31:28.180 --> 31:33.300\nget wanted stars. And the fun of it is if you you know, you got one goal like a little\n\n31:33.300 --> 31:38.060\nkid playing tag or something, you know, you got to you have these paint shops around town\n\n31:38.060 --> 31:42.220\nis basically one of one of only a few ways that you can if you get during a during a\n\n31:42.220 --> 31:47.740\nhigh speed chase, even if you it keeps increasing in stars. So the more stars you're wanted,\n\n31:47.740 --> 31:52.780\nthe more levels of law enforcement come out. So you eventually it's helicopters and SWAT\n\n31:52.780 --> 31:57.860\nteams and tanks and the National Guard comes to get you. And at any point, you can just\n\n31:57.860 --> 32:04.380\npull into a spray shop and have your car instantly spray painted. And when you pull out, as long\n\n32:04.380 --> 32:09.220\nas you don't bump anybody on the backing out, you're you're free again. They're not they\n\n32:09.220 --> 32:13.700\ncan't find you. Your car is a different color. Now, obviously, that's ridiculous. However,\n\n32:13.700 --> 32:16.980\nif you look at it from a gaming mechanics standpoint, it's actually hard to emulate\n\n32:16.980 --> 32:21.740\nthat in the old West under any circumstances. You can't get your horse painted, your horse\n\n32:21.740 --> 32:25.940\npainted, and it somehow works a little better. But my point is, I don't think it's really\n\n32:25.940 --> 32:32.300\nan internal logic issue. I think it's that look, I mean, I think it's like, I think it's\n\n32:32.300 --> 32:36.540\nlike they're great at making these games. I think that part of them being great at making\n\n32:36.540 --> 32:40.660\ngames is that they have this sort of almost it's ingrained in there, because I see the\n\n32:40.660 --> 32:45.820\nsame names in the credits. There's, you know, it's not like a new generation of of people\n\n32:45.820 --> 32:50.380\ntaking over and a brand, they see the same names of designers and stuff. And it's like,\n\n32:50.380 --> 32:55.180\nI think that they they probably goes hand in hand, being able to make such a crazy open\n\n32:55.180 --> 33:01.020\nworld sandbox game and having a mind that's probably pretty allergic to the concept of\n\n33:01.020 --> 33:08.300\nputting things on rails, especially morally. However, you got to admit that Red Dead Redemption\n\n33:08.300 --> 33:14.020\n2 certainly in a game set in the old West with multiracial characters and a bunch of\n\n33:14.020 --> 33:24.340\nwomen in it, there's a notable absence of of the the degrees of of depth in the moral\n\n33:24.340 --> 33:29.340\nsense that the game goes to compared to like, I can't name examples offhand, but you just\n\n33:29.340 --> 33:34.060\nkind of sense it. You're like, well, you know, it kind of just tries to slam in your face\n\n33:34.060 --> 33:38.620\nthat like, no matter what you are, you're kind of the bad guys. And I don't know, which\n\n33:38.620 --> 33:43.660\nis the point of it. And to me, I keep getting confused. I think because of that, I think\n\n33:43.660 --> 33:47.460\nit's because there's like a, it's like, oh, if I could just get it through my head that\n\n33:47.460 --> 33:52.660\nit's Grand Theft Auto on a fucking horse and stop. But I keep being told by the game that\n\n33:52.660 --> 33:56.260\nit's horrible when you do bad things, though, unlike in Grand Theft Auto, it feels very\n\n33:56.260 --> 33:59.940\nempty. But at this, it's like, I don't know, someone's like, how you doing? And then you\n\n33:59.940 --> 34:04.340\nlike step on her foot in the horse and she's like, yeah, it just like, it feels it's like,\n\n34:04.340 --> 34:09.140\noh, no, I got to reload my save. Like it feels horrible to do anything wrong in this game\n\n34:09.140 --> 34:11.500\nwhere in Grand Theft Auto, it's kind of like, haha.\n\n34:11.500 --> 34:15.340\nAlso the sophistication, it doesn't, it's like, it's, it's, it's a, the mechanics are\n\n34:15.340 --> 34:18.940\nlike, it's a, it's a, it's a great thing. You can like walk and you pull the left trigger\n\n34:18.940 --> 34:22.100\nwhen you see somebody in context when you comes up. So you can kind of experience these things\n\n34:22.100 --> 34:28.660\nand like, you walk by, they say random things and you got, you got your binary option of\n\n34:28.660 --> 34:35.140\nor I guess triple option because you can, you can diffuse antagonize or greet. But the,\n\n34:35.140 --> 34:40.820\nthe upshot is that you can walk in real time and almost kind of like marionette a real person\n\n34:40.820 --> 34:47.060\nin terms of like verbal encounters with strangers. If that's your jam, if what you want is immersiveness\n\n34:47.060 --> 34:52.180\nand you experience walking and, and just howdy, hey, fuck yourself. Hey, you don't got to\n\n34:52.180 --> 34:55.900\nbe like that and keep walking. And you're, and you're like, you're kind of like, all\n\n34:55.900 --> 35:00.500\nof these things are not like times not stopping and you don't have to like, you know, load\n\n35:00.500 --> 35:07.740\nthis and do that. And, and that's really cool. But the, the downside of that is if you're\n\n35:07.740 --> 35:14.620\nreally immersed in this world, you're walking around and people are constantly saying, I\n\n35:14.620 --> 35:20.340\ndon't like the looks in your face. And I'm like, and all you can do is tie him up and\n\n35:20.340 --> 35:25.220\ntoss him in a bush. It's like, it's like, you know, from a gaming perspective that there's\n\n35:25.220 --> 35:30.500\nno profit in stopping and doing anything with this person. But it's like so immersive now\n\n35:30.500 --> 35:35.700\nthat I'm like, I'm the guy that it took, it took so long to go bisexual and fall out.\n\n35:35.700 --> 35:41.100\nIt's like, you know, because I, I just like, I have this like, I'm like, I, I, I, it's\n\n35:41.100 --> 35:44.980\npart of my, I think my clinical narcissism is that you can really get me into a game\n\n35:44.980 --> 35:49.140\nand I, and tell me that, you know, that's me. And then I'll take that really seriously.\n\n35:49.140 --> 35:52.700\nYou can't be bisexual and red dead. I, well, I don't know.\n\n35:52.700 --> 35:54.980\nYou can't even have sex with the, with the sex workers there.\n\n35:54.980 --> 35:57.820\nYeah. He doesn't seem to be into women for whatever reason.\n\n35:57.820 --> 36:02.620\nOne thing that I was confused by, you said one of the hard things to do in, in red dead\n\n36:02.620 --> 36:06.020\nredemption too is you can't find your left leg in a bathtub.\n\n36:06.020 --> 36:07.020\nOh yeah.\n\n36:07.020 --> 36:10.820\nYeah. That's a real thing. You take a bath, sometimes you have to pay 50 cents to do that.\n\n36:10.820 --> 36:15.380\nAnd if you go and take a bath, that event, you, after you finish washing your head, there's\n\n36:15.380 --> 36:18.980\na knock on the door and a woman says, would you like, would you like some help in there?\n\n36:18.980 --> 36:24.180\nAnd if you pay 50 cents, a woman will come in and this goes to this kind of labyrinth\n\n36:24.180 --> 36:26.020\nthing. There's no game to it, right?\n\n36:26.020 --> 36:29.620\nNo, you just press, you just press any number of buttons that you want to.\n\n36:29.620 --> 36:33.660\nJust indicating what part of your body you want washed. And then there's an option to\n\n36:33.660 --> 36:38.740\nmake small talk while you're doing it. And she responds with, you know, algorithmically.\n\n36:38.740 --> 36:43.740\nAnd she, I was like, Oh, it's, it's like, it's eventually this is you're going to unlock\n\n36:43.740 --> 36:45.420\na hand job or something.\n\n36:45.420 --> 36:48.220\nThat's what it leads you to believe. But I don't know. After the first one, I was like,\n\n36:48.220 --> 36:50.620\nthis just seems like a red herring to me.\n\n36:50.620 --> 36:55.340\nIt's really weird. But then again, that's what I mean, Grand Theft Auto was kind of,\n\n36:55.340 --> 36:59.020\nthey let it leak that there was a way to get a sex worker in your car.\n\n36:59.020 --> 37:01.420\nOh, that's different. I was thinking the hot coffee.\n\n37:01.420 --> 37:06.940\nIt wasn't like an automatic thing. Anyways, but there's no, there's no funny business,\n\n37:06.940 --> 37:08.380\nno sex happening in the game.\n\n37:08.380 --> 37:12.660\nNot unless you assume something's happening under the water that is both instantaneous\n\n37:12.660 --> 37:16.940\nand that he has a poker face about it because he's, that he's a cowboy and he doesn't want\n\n37:16.940 --> 37:17.940\nto.\n\n37:17.940 --> 37:21.900\nBut in a lot of the interactions, it sets up that he's kind of just not interested\n\n37:21.900 --> 37:23.780\nin anyone who expresses.\n\n37:23.780 --> 37:25.140\nLet's spread a rumor that he's gay.\n\n37:25.140 --> 37:29.980\nWell, I mean, yeah, who knows, he might be, but he certainly doesn't seem into it. He\n\n37:29.980 --> 37:30.980\npisses people off.\n\n37:30.980 --> 37:32.860\nHe's an asexual cowboy.\n\n37:32.860 --> 37:33.860\nIt's great.\n\n37:33.860 --> 37:38.780\nThat would be a huge advantage in the old West, I think, to be asexual.\n\n37:38.780 --> 37:44.700\nThat's true because he's always having to go after like women and haul them into prison\n\n37:44.700 --> 37:49.460\nand stuff. You know, you can't be seducted or, you know,\n\n37:49.460 --> 37:54.420\nI have asexual questions. Is anybody openly asexual? Also, is that a thing?\n\n37:54.420 --> 37:56.500\nLike, or is it a thing?\n\n37:56.500 --> 37:57.500\nYeah.\n\n37:57.500 --> 38:00.180\nAre you, I'm not even going to make eye contact because I don't want to put you in the spot.\n\n38:00.180 --> 38:03.860\nIf you don't want to be put on the spot, are you, are you, are you self-applying that,\n\n38:03.860 --> 38:04.860\nthat phrase?\n\n38:04.860 --> 38:05.860\nOh, okay.\n\n38:05.860 --> 38:08.340\nMe neither, by the way.\n\n38:08.340 --> 38:13.460\nBut yeah, if anybody, if anybody, if anybody's like, like, confidently like, yeah, I'm asexual,\n\n38:13.460 --> 38:17.580\nthat's what I identify as. I'd love to have a conversation with you if you don't mind\n\n38:17.580 --> 38:18.580\nbeing asked.\n\n38:18.580 --> 38:19.580\nEspecially if you're also a cowboy.\n\n38:19.580 --> 38:20.580\nSome naive.\n\n38:20.580 --> 38:21.580\nThat would be great.\n\n38:21.580 --> 38:22.580\nThat would be, but I would consider that great.\n\n38:22.580 --> 38:23.580\nWe'll get a fucking asexual cowboy up our faces.\n\n38:23.580 --> 38:24.580\nWe're going to be podcast dynamite.\n\n38:24.580 --> 38:25.580\nWe're going to be a cowboy.\n\n38:25.580 --> 38:26.580\nWe're going to be a cowboy.\n\n38:26.580 --> 38:27.580\nWe're going to be a cowboy.\n\n38:27.580 --> 38:28.580\nWe're going to be a cowboy.\n\n38:28.580 --> 38:30.580\nWe have a cowboy.\n\n38:30.580 --> 38:35.700\nYou know, if you're, if you really follow the code of what we understand to be the true\n\n38:35.700 --> 38:39.180\ncowboy, you would be asexual, wouldn't you?\n\n38:39.180 --> 38:40.180\nWell, yeah.\n\n38:40.180 --> 38:41.180\nBuy?\n\n38:41.180 --> 38:42.180\nWhy buy?\n\n38:42.180 --> 38:43.180\nOkay.\n\n38:43.180 --> 38:51.980\nTrue cowboys, true cowboys have sex with land genies.\n\n38:51.980 --> 38:57.700\nYou just want bisexuality to get, you know, signal boosted in any context.\n\n38:57.700 --> 39:02.700\nYou're like, you're like that guy at every protest that has the legalized weed.\n\n39:02.700 --> 39:07.700\nI think like the, a lot of cowboys, when they, because they always leave at the end, you\n\n39:07.700 --> 39:11.020\nknow, like Shane or you know, like, they write off in the sense that they're like, they're\n\n39:11.020 --> 39:14.380\nlike, bye-bye sexual, like, bye-bye.\n\n39:14.380 --> 39:15.380\nYeah.\n\n39:15.380 --> 39:18.380\nThank you.\n\n39:18.380 --> 39:21.820\nIt is kind of defined at least in silver screen terms as like, you know, I mean, one of the\n\n39:21.820 --> 39:25.740\nmajor foundations is for sure, unless you're a bad guy, you don't, you don't, you don't\n\n39:25.740 --> 39:33.140\ncross boundaries with an unwilling filly, you know, like you, you're certainly not maybe\n\n39:33.140 --> 39:40.980\nregarding women as equals in a society governed by reason, but that's, a lot of that's not\n\n39:40.980 --> 39:42.340\nyour fault as a cowboy.\n\n39:42.340 --> 39:47.900\nYou're just, you're just a cowboy, but you, but, but you definitely are, you know, you're\n\n39:47.900 --> 39:54.460\nnot, you're never gonna, you wouldn't be a good cowboy if you, if you took liberties.\n\n39:54.460 --> 39:55.460\nRight.\n\n39:55.460 --> 39:59.060\nSo, what'd you say?\n\n39:59.060 --> 40:00.900\nWaterworld?\n\n40:00.900 --> 40:05.980\nWaterworld by contrast.\n\n40:05.980 --> 40:12.300\nEven in childhood, women are nothing more than maps to dry land.\n\n40:12.300 --> 40:15.580\nSomething to draw upon.\n\n40:15.580 --> 40:19.660\nBut there isn't a lot of westerns because there was, there were small cast, small sets, and\n\n40:19.660 --> 40:24.300\nusually not a lot of women characters because of, for a lot of reasons, but one that actresses\n\n40:24.300 --> 40:30.700\nwere expensive, like to get a big star like, like, like, you know, Hollywood star in the,\n\n40:30.700 --> 40:35.820\nin the thing, that in the same way, kind of like in Die Hard, there's, there's often\n\n40:35.820 --> 40:40.660\nscenes in, in westerns where the bad guy and the good guy meet and it's almost flirtatious.\n\n40:40.660 --> 40:41.660\nIt's kind of like this.\n\n40:41.660 --> 40:42.660\nRight.\n\n40:42.660 --> 40:46.580\nWhere there's kind of a sexual vibe to it, like in Shane with Jack Pounds when he sees\n\n40:46.580 --> 40:51.300\nAlan Ladd, like, he kind of checks him out and it's, it's kind of like, it's, it's, it's\n\n40:51.300 --> 40:53.300\nalmost a little like sexy.\n\n40:53.300 --> 40:54.300\nWell, definitely.\n\n40:54.300 --> 40:55.300\nYeah.\n\n40:55.300 --> 40:58.300\nI mean, they certainly land that in Westworld with Yule Brenner and, let's just say, I mean,\n\n40:58.300 --> 41:01.300\nit's like, like, even though he's a robot pretending to be a bad guy, kind of like,\n\n41:01.300 --> 41:02.300\nRichard Benjamin.\n\n41:02.300 --> 41:03.300\nVery sexual.\n\n41:03.300 --> 41:07.300\nIt's one, it's one actor with no eyebrows, another actor who has just 90% eyebrows.\n\n41:07.300 --> 41:10.300\nWhy don't you go home to your mama?\n\n41:10.300 --> 41:12.300\nThat movie sucks.\n\n41:12.300 --> 41:15.300\nIt starts off great.\n\n41:15.300 --> 41:17.300\nIt starts off so good.\n\n41:17.300 --> 41:19.300\nWhy are we in Rome now?\n\n41:19.300 --> 41:22.900\nLike, like, they go to like, it's just, I just love the idea of the river in that movie,\n\n41:22.900 --> 41:28.700\nthe way that you can tell these, these, these robots that you can have sex with that look\n\n41:28.700 --> 41:30.900\nlike, so we'll look at their hands though.\n\n41:30.900 --> 41:34.900\nThey can't, science can't recreate the poem.\n\n41:34.900 --> 41:36.900\nThe fingertips are all weird.\n\n41:36.900 --> 41:38.900\nThat's how we felt in the 70s.\n\n41:38.900 --> 41:40.900\nWe felt like, we're going to, we're going to get there.\n\n41:40.900 --> 41:43.900\nYou know, you see these Halloween masks this year, they're pretty, but they're getting,\n\n41:43.900 --> 41:45.900\nthat guy looks a lot like Nixon.\n\n41:45.900 --> 41:51.900\nAnd we just kind of, I think we thought like, yeah, you know, that hand, we were all intelligent\n\n41:51.900 --> 41:52.900\ndesign people.\n\n41:52.900 --> 41:55.900\nThey were like, how do you, how do you ever make a fake hand?\n\n41:55.900 --> 41:56.900\nIt's a robot.\n\n41:56.900 --> 41:58.900\nIt's going to have claws.\n\n41:58.900 --> 42:02.900\nWe can make a guy look just like your runner.\n\n42:02.900 --> 42:05.900\nYeah, I rewatched that with church.\n\n42:05.900 --> 42:08.900\nSpeaking of Hollywood in the 70s and weird things.\n\n42:08.900 --> 42:12.900\nHere's a podcast recommend.\n\n42:12.900 --> 42:16.900\nThere's an Australian podcast called Fatal Voyage.\n\n42:16.900 --> 42:20.900\nIt's a reexamination of Natalie Wood's death.\n\n42:20.900 --> 42:25.900\nI guess that, I guess that, I guess, I guess it was technically reopened or something.\n\n42:25.900 --> 42:29.900\nLike, because the captain that was on the boat.\n\n42:29.900 --> 42:36.900\nFor those of you who don't know Natalie Wood, she was an incredibly famous actor.\n\n42:36.900 --> 42:42.900\nShe, she married for a second time, Robert Wagner, who's still alive.\n\n42:42.900 --> 42:44.900\nHe was in this show called Heart to Heart.\n\n42:44.900 --> 42:46.900\nAnd before that he was a movie star.\n\n42:46.900 --> 42:53.900\nThey had a, you know, the Natalie Wood was in a movie called Brainstorm with Christopher\n\n42:53.900 --> 42:54.900\nWalken.\n\n42:54.900 --> 42:58.900\nFor some reason, this is the part that really confuses Schrab a lot more than it does me,\n\n42:58.900 --> 43:02.900\nbecause I've always, I've always equated Christopher Walken with you.\n\n43:02.900 --> 43:06.900\nLike, I always, why?\n\n43:06.900 --> 43:09.900\nAnd I imagine coming off of the deer hunter and having an Oscar.\n\n43:09.900 --> 43:13.900\nLike, like, like, like Schrab is, Schrab just can't get his mind around it.\n\n43:13.900 --> 43:21.900\nIt's like, why, who invites Christopher Walken alone onto a boat to Catalina and just hand,\n\n43:21.900 --> 43:23.900\nand I'm like, doesn't it seem like something Jeff would just be like,\n\n43:23.900 --> 43:25.900\nhmm, Natalie Wood, do you know what I mean, are you got?\n\n43:25.900 --> 43:26.900\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna go.\n\n43:26.900 --> 43:29.900\nAnything you want me to ask her?\n\n43:29.900 --> 43:31.900\nAnd that you wouldn't bring a date.\n\n43:31.900 --> 43:34.900\nIs that how I sound?\n\n43:34.900 --> 43:39.900\nHey boo boo, hey boo boo, hey boo boo.\n\n43:39.900 --> 43:40.900\nWhy am I a yokey bear?\n\n43:40.900 --> 43:42.900\nWhat am I, rich little?\n\n43:42.900 --> 43:44.900\nHey boo boo, hey boo boo.\n\n43:44.900 --> 43:46.900\nI had to make you sound different from me.\n\n43:46.900 --> 43:49.900\nOkay.\n\n43:49.900 --> 43:56.900\nBut anyways, but just, I mean, for those who are totally un indoctrinated to this sort of like legendary kind of Hollywood Babylon thing,\n\n43:56.900 --> 44:03.900\nwhere Natalie Wood drowned that weekend, and it was like, there were four people on the boat,\n\n44:03.900 --> 44:06.900\nincluding the captain, and one of them ended up dead, and there was never a,\n\n44:06.900 --> 44:09.900\nit was never really regarded as a homicide.\n\n44:09.900 --> 44:13.900\nAnd so, all this time, it's always just been this thing of like,\n\n44:13.900 --> 44:17.900\nsomething fucked up went on on that boat, and there's, there, there was always the,\n\n44:17.900 --> 44:25.900\nI always, I always thought it was very silly and kind of provincial of people to go.\n\n44:25.900 --> 44:31.900\nWell, the two automatic courses are like, obviously it's like, he was a jealous kind of husband,\n\n44:31.900 --> 44:36.900\nhe had a jealousy streak, he once followed Warren Beatty home with a gun because she was in a movie with him,\n\n44:36.900 --> 44:41.900\nand he was like, you know, he's, he's capable of going there and jealous, jealousy.\n\n44:41.900 --> 44:43.900\nSo, obviously that's the first place.\n\n44:43.900 --> 44:46.900\nWhich is a big predictor for like serious male violence and murder.\n\n44:46.900 --> 44:51.900\nIt's obviously the first place you'd go in a regular, even regular death as you look at the husband first,\n\n44:51.900 --> 44:57.900\nlet alone if he's the only one capable of being near you, and there's a history there.\n\n44:57.900 --> 45:01.900\nAnd there's four people on the boat, so there's the captain, Christopher Walken, the guy and the girl.\n\n45:01.900 --> 45:02.900\nRight.\n\n45:02.900 --> 45:08.900\nAnd I always thought, and so that, that always makes sense to me, but I always thought it was like a very kind of Midwestern\n\n45:08.900 --> 45:15.900\nholly, looking at Hollywood thing that people would go, you know what really happened is Robert Wagner was fucking Christopher Walken.\n\n45:15.900 --> 45:18.900\nNatalie Wood walked in and she was like, that's it.\n\n45:18.900 --> 45:20.900\nAnd they clubbed her to death and threw her in the water.\n\n45:20.900 --> 45:21.900\nI'm like, come on.\n\n45:21.900 --> 45:26.900\nLike, why, why do we, why do we just, because that's the only other scenario that you can imagine.\n\n45:26.900 --> 45:29.900\nAnd it's like, oh, Hollywood's bisexual and all this stuff.\n\n45:29.900 --> 45:32.900\nBut it, and then I'm going to turn this podcast over to you.\n\n45:32.900 --> 45:37.900\nSo I don't want to spoil everything, but it does turn out that Robert Wagner, that he was married to Natalie Wood twice.\n\n45:37.900 --> 45:45.900\nAnd the reason they got divorced the first time is because she caught him in an affair with a man.\n\n45:45.900 --> 45:46.900\nOh, really?\n\n45:46.900 --> 45:51.900\nAnd so that doesn't automatically mean you're going to fuck Christopher Walken as I'm connecting those dots.\n\n45:51.900 --> 45:54.900\nBut I was surprised to find that out and was like, holy shit.\n\n45:54.900 --> 45:58.900\nBut I said, but yeah, and so if we were to continue to talk about it, I tell you.\n\n45:58.900 --> 45:59.900\nWhat was the podcast?\n\n45:59.900 --> 46:02.900\nIt's called Fatal Voyage.\n\n46:02.900 --> 46:05.900\nIt's just like one of those like one-off kind of mini-series.\n\n46:05.900 --> 46:06.900\nHell yeah.\n\n46:06.900 --> 46:07.900\nThat sounds awesome.\n\n46:07.900 --> 46:09.900\nYou know what I think?\n\n46:09.900 --> 46:17.900\nIt's another one called the RFK tapes, I think.\n\n46:17.900 --> 46:24.900\nThese are all, Cody finds these and we sleep to podcasts, but I think it's called the RFK tapes, RFK something.\n\n46:24.900 --> 46:35.900\nIt's a re-examination of the assassination of Robert Kennedy by this like weird guy, Sirhan Sirhan.\n\n46:35.900 --> 46:51.900\nAnd a really fascinating, like intimate examination of a really nice, smart, cool guy who is absolutely convinced that this is an elaborate conspiracy.\n\n46:51.900 --> 46:54.900\nAnd he doesn't have tin foil on his head.\n\n46:54.900 --> 46:55.900\nHe's not defensive.\n\n46:55.900 --> 46:59.900\nHe doesn't start throwing things if you say you think he's full of shit.\n\n46:59.900 --> 47:12.900\nSo it's like very, and yet what he believes is the case is so hard to believe.\n\n47:12.900 --> 47:16.900\nBut it's fun to listen to for a couple episodes.\n\n47:16.900 --> 47:25.900\nThe couple being, it's totality, and I don't mean it takes a shit in the middle.\n\n47:25.900 --> 47:32.900\nYeah, I like to come to Harmontown and get my recommendations for other podcasts.\n\n47:32.900 --> 47:36.900\nIf you haven't listened to Heavyweight are ever on...\n\n47:36.900 --> 47:44.900\nI go to Trader Joe's to get coupons to Ralph's.\n\n47:44.900 --> 47:46.900\nMy friend Rob Corddry was on this show.\n\n47:46.900 --> 47:48.900\nIt's a good entry point if you don't have any other.\n\n47:48.900 --> 47:50.900\nBut there's this show called Heavyweight.\n\n47:50.900 --> 47:55.900\nNow I can't remember the guy's name, John Goldstein or something like that.\n\n47:55.900 --> 47:59.900\nBut it's a network, Gimlet Media.\n\n47:59.900 --> 48:03.900\nHe's this guy who just gets up in other people's business.\n\n48:03.900 --> 48:04.900\nSo if you have a...\n\n48:04.900 --> 48:11.900\nI think it's called Heavyweight because it usually deals with shit that's weighed on people for a while and has been unresolved.\n\n48:11.900 --> 48:17.900\nPeople come to him and say, I haven't spoken to my aunt in 30 years\n\n48:17.900 --> 48:20.900\nand I'm convinced it's because she thinks I'm racist or whatever.\n\n48:20.900 --> 48:24.900\nWe had an argument over pretzels at this lake house or whatever.\n\n48:24.900 --> 48:26.900\nI just can't talk to her.\n\n48:26.900 --> 48:29.900\nI get these mixed signals and all this stuff and then he'll just call her.\n\n48:29.900 --> 48:37.900\nHe just kind of realized at some point in his life that the only thing he was good at was...\n\n48:37.900 --> 48:38.900\nResolving stuff?\n\n48:38.900 --> 48:40.900\nGetting his nose in everybody's business.\n\n48:40.900 --> 48:42.900\nDoes he fix shit?\n\n48:42.900 --> 48:44.900\nYeah, no, he very much does.\n\n48:44.900 --> 48:47.900\nOtherwise he would be a horrible person.\n\n48:47.900 --> 48:49.900\nSounds like a Red Dead redemption character.\n\n48:49.900 --> 48:51.900\nHe's got a very high resolution rate.\n\n48:51.900 --> 48:55.900\nEven when it sometimes it turns out that the person that thought that their issue was with someone else,\n\n48:55.900 --> 48:59.900\nit turns out that they need to confront somebody about themselves and he'll successfully get that.\n\n48:59.900 --> 49:05.900\nAlright, so you're Red Dead, you're walking around, somebody calls you an asshole, you step on their foot, they scream.\n\n49:05.900 --> 49:12.900\nWhat button, physically, how do you tie somebody up? What's the interface that you use a rope to tie somebody up?\n\n49:12.900 --> 49:16.900\nWell first, Jeff, you'd hold down the LB button to bring up your weapon wheel.\n\n49:16.900 --> 49:19.900\nHopefully you have your lap so equipped already.\n\n49:19.900 --> 49:22.900\nYeah, hopefully you loaded that out for when you got off your horse.\n\n49:22.900 --> 49:23.900\nOr you're on your horse.\n\n49:23.900 --> 49:27.900\nAnd you use the control stick to select it.\n\n49:27.900 --> 49:30.900\nAnd then now you have your rope equip.\n\n49:30.900 --> 49:36.900\nAnd then you hold down the R trigger, I think, and the L trigger to aim and swing it around.\n\n49:36.900 --> 49:40.900\nOh man, you're aiming and you let it go by letting go the trigger.\n\n49:40.900 --> 49:45.900\nAnd then I think you then immediately have to hit the trigger again to hold on to it.\n\n49:45.900 --> 49:50.900\nOtherwise, when you tie them up, you will immediately let them go and they will get up and run away.\n\n49:50.900 --> 49:58.900\nBut if you hold the trigger and you hold them tied up and then you can slowly walk to them and hog tie them with the B button.\n\n49:58.900 --> 50:00.900\nThank you very much, Spencer.\n\n50:00.900 --> 50:04.900\nYeah, my first bounty was that black widow lady.\n\n50:04.900 --> 50:06.900\nThat's why it's good to be asexual in that game.\n\n50:06.900 --> 50:08.900\nThink of what she'd pulled.\n\n50:08.900 --> 50:10.900\nWell, I wasn't tempted to do anything.\n\n50:10.900 --> 50:12.900\nShe tries to tempt you.\n\n50:12.900 --> 50:14.900\nWell, I know, but I'm not.\n\n50:14.900 --> 50:20.900\nBut I got my lasso out and I was like, I'm not having any conversation with this person.\n\n50:20.900 --> 50:26.900\nI successfully lassoed her from my horse, but then getting off my horse I let go of the rope.\n\n50:26.900 --> 50:29.900\nShe got up and just immediately, it was like a nightmare.\n\n50:29.900 --> 50:32.900\nShe came up at the moment and started slashing me with a knife.\n\n50:32.900 --> 50:34.900\nAnd then I just did what I always do.\n\n50:34.900 --> 50:36.900\nI ran.\n\n50:36.900 --> 50:41.900\nI spent so much of that game just running off into the wilderness.\n\n50:41.900 --> 50:49.900\nAnd then come back around in a big circle while they slowly forget I ever existed and go back to doing what they were doing.\n\n50:49.900 --> 50:54.900\nIf you lasso somebody but don't hold down the trigger once they're lassoed, do they get up and run away?\n\n50:54.900 --> 50:56.900\nYeah, it's like you've essentially just tripped them.\n\n50:56.900 --> 50:58.900\nBut now you've also lost your rope.\n\n50:58.900 --> 51:00.900\nNo, no, you have infinite rope for some reason.\n\n51:00.900 --> 51:02.900\nYeah, your infinite rope.\n\n51:02.900 --> 51:04.900\nOh yeah, it's great.\n\n51:04.900 --> 51:13.900\nYeah, no, but I that same exact thing happened to me and then she like slashed me like four times and I was almost dead and I like ran off 15 feet and then tied her up.\n\n51:13.900 --> 51:15.900\nIt was great.\n\n51:15.900 --> 51:19.900\nYou really that's the only thing you could do in this game is tie people up.\n\n51:19.900 --> 51:21.900\nIt's amazing.\n\n51:21.900 --> 51:23.900\nIt sounds terrible.\n\n51:23.900 --> 51:25.900\nYeah, you could also shoot animals.\n\n51:25.900 --> 51:26.900\nIt's a gorgeous game.\n\n51:26.900 --> 51:34.900\nI mean, it's really like the combination of the kind of the dedication of some team over there because I remember Grand Theft Auto 5 came out.\n\n51:34.900 --> 51:36.900\nIs that the one where you're Russian?\n\n51:36.900 --> 51:37.900\nI think four.\n\n51:37.900 --> 51:40.900\nI remember there was a kind of like, I think there's, you know, there's people.\n\n51:40.900 --> 51:48.900\nYou can imagine there's probably camps that are like, we need to make this thing look fucking gorgeous and have all these details and you should be able to have a cell phone and farm potatoes.\n\n51:48.900 --> 51:57.900\nAnd that there are times that those teams are the enemy of a good game because you're just like, just make it a little better than San Andreas and we will all would have been so happy.\n\n51:57.900 --> 52:05.900\nBut then I mean, I think this game represents that camp getting getting getting to have their day in court.\n\n52:05.900 --> 52:07.900\nThey're like, the technology is here.\n\n52:07.900 --> 52:09.900\nThe screens are 4k.\n\n52:09.900 --> 52:14.900\nThe boxes can run it like, let's make a let it be photo realistic.\n\n52:14.900 --> 52:15.900\nNo cut scenes.\n\n52:15.900 --> 52:19.900\nThey try so hard for there to never be any transition to anything.\n\n52:19.900 --> 52:23.900\nSo you're just like walking through saloon doors and then you're in the saloon until you leave.\n\n52:23.900 --> 52:25.900\nAnd there's never any loading or anything.\n\n52:25.900 --> 52:27.900\nWell, there is some loading.\n\n52:27.900 --> 52:29.900\nDon't write letters.\n\n52:29.900 --> 52:31.900\nThere's no guests.\n\n52:31.900 --> 52:32.900\nMy feet are tired.\n\n52:32.900 --> 52:34.900\nI usually don't sit down until there's a guest.\n\n52:34.900 --> 52:39.900\nNova, do you want to come up or are you tired of being exploited?\n\n52:39.900 --> 52:40.900\nOkay.\n\n52:40.900 --> 52:41.900\nOur guest, Nova.\n\n52:41.900 --> 52:52.900\nCan I just quickly give a plug?\n\n52:52.900 --> 52:55.900\nWe still need some audience members for Wednesday to Friday.\n\n52:55.900 --> 53:01.900\nSo if you guys want a free show sometime this week, come come to harm a quest tapings harm a quest dot com particular.\n\n53:01.900 --> 53:03.900\nOh yeah, we're doing that in a couple days.\n\n53:03.900 --> 53:09.900\nYeah, Saturday and Sunday, I think are full, but we really we really could use some more people.\n\n53:09.900 --> 53:11.900\nThey're free seats, I think.\n\n53:11.900 --> 53:14.900\nSo Wednesday to Friday this week, if you guys are interested.\n\n53:14.900 --> 53:15.900\nWednesday.\n\n53:15.900 --> 53:21.900\nI'm going to get my hair cut by the person whose job is supposedly only to comb my hair.\n\n53:21.900 --> 53:23.900\nOh, no.\n\n53:23.900 --> 53:25.900\nI'm sure they're stoked about that.\n\n53:25.900 --> 53:26.900\nYeah.\n\n53:26.900 --> 53:29.900\nSo I get paid the same, but I have to touch your fucking gross scalp.\n\n53:29.900 --> 53:32.900\nAre we doing like any kind of meeting?\n\n53:32.900 --> 53:33.900\nHave a meeting before this?\n\n53:33.900 --> 53:37.900\nOr am I just showing up to the thing in two days and we're just going to start bone-weave a little bit again?\n\n53:37.900 --> 53:38.900\nI'd love to talk to you.\n\n53:38.900 --> 53:41.900\nI don't know when Erin's showing up, but yeah, I mean, we should do that.\n\n53:41.900 --> 53:42.900\nAbsolutely.\n\n53:42.900 --> 53:44.900\nWe should do a lot of things to prepare.\n\n53:44.900 --> 53:45.900\nIt really caught me off guard.\n\n53:45.900 --> 53:53.900\nI was thinking among many things that ex-wife Erin McGathy would buy before we were taping that she would probably pop by the show and\n\n53:53.900 --> 53:55.900\nreconnoit her with the audience.\n\n53:55.900 --> 53:56.900\nHello, Nova.\n\n53:56.900 --> 53:57.900\nHello.\n\n53:57.900 --> 53:58.900\nSorry, Nova.\n\n53:58.900 --> 53:59.900\nNo, no problem.\n\n53:59.900 --> 54:00.900\nHow are you doing?\n\n54:00.900 --> 54:01.900\nGood.\n\n54:01.900 --> 54:02.900\nWhy?\n\n54:02.900 --> 54:04.900\nThat seemed a little equivocal.\n\n54:04.900 --> 54:10.900\nNo, I'm just, I don't know, I'm in a weird mood, but yeah, I've been good.\n\n54:10.900 --> 54:11.900\nYeah.\n\n54:11.900 --> 54:12.900\nI'm sold.\n\n54:12.900 --> 54:13.900\nFair enough.\n\n54:13.900 --> 54:20.900\nWhen I'm in a weird mood, I usually find that when people pester me about it, it makes me explain.\n\n54:20.900 --> 54:21.900\nIt makes you normal, right?\n\n54:21.900 --> 54:22.900\nYeah.\n\n54:22.900 --> 54:23.900\nIt just evens it out.\n\n54:23.900 --> 54:29.900\nWell, it usually leads to me being so desperate to feel something that I'll even exaggerate shit.\n\n54:29.900 --> 54:36.900\nAnd it'll be a conversation that ends with the person going, Jesus Christ, well, God, feel better.\n\n54:36.900 --> 54:39.900\nWell, you kept asking me how I was.\n\n54:39.900 --> 54:41.900\nI had to make something up.\n\n54:41.900 --> 54:42.900\nOh.\n\n54:42.900 --> 54:48.900\nBut is your weird mood, do those still waters actually run deep?\n\n54:48.900 --> 54:49.900\nYeah.\n\n54:49.900 --> 54:50.900\nI don't know.\n\n54:50.900 --> 54:56.900\nI'm in a weird place right now because I don't want to talk forever or anything.\n\n54:56.900 --> 55:03.900\nBut yeah, I've been trying to get down my anxiety, so I've started meditating and then...\n\n55:03.900 --> 55:04.900\nThat's great.\n\n55:04.900 --> 55:05.900\nYeah, I'm going to try.\n\n55:05.900 --> 55:09.900\nBy the way, when has anyone on the show ever gotten away with talking anywhere near forever except me?\n\n55:09.900 --> 55:10.900\nThat's true.\n\n55:10.900 --> 55:12.900\nYeah, no, I'll be interrupted if I talk too much.\n\n55:12.900 --> 55:13.900\nThat's good.\n\n55:13.900 --> 55:16.900\nYou'll be interrupted if you're sharing a really deeply personal thing.\n\n55:16.900 --> 55:18.900\nI'll be like, well, let me tell you about that.\n\n55:18.900 --> 55:19.900\nYeah.\n\n55:19.900 --> 55:23.900\nAnd I'm going to try to eat better and more regularly, and I'm going to try to start exercising,\n\n55:23.900 --> 55:27.900\nand hopefully that'll bring my anxiety down, and I'll be able to function better.\n\n55:27.900 --> 55:32.900\nIt hasn't destroyed my anxiety, but it has helped somewhat to exercise, so I hope you get some relief from that.\n\n55:32.900 --> 55:35.900\nI think it'll be good, yeah, especially like the meditation.\n\n55:35.900 --> 55:40.900\nAnd it's kind of that, and then I'm happy, and I'm doing things I like, and I'm starting to relax.\n\n55:40.900 --> 55:44.900\nBut then there's also, like, I'm having all these existential crises,\n\n55:44.900 --> 55:48.900\nand I'm upset about all the awful things happening, which usually I never pay attention to,\n\n55:48.900 --> 55:50.900\nbut lately it's really hit me bad.\n\n55:50.900 --> 55:51.900\nSure.\n\n55:51.900 --> 55:55.900\nAnd so it's this weird kind of, I'm just having a weird kind of time at home,\n\n55:55.900 --> 56:02.900\nkind of having existential crises and feeling bad, and then kind of like finding how to make it okay,\n\n56:02.900 --> 56:05.900\nand kind of having fun and stuff, so, yeah.\n\n56:05.900 --> 56:10.900\nAt home, I know you're quite young, and you live in with the folks.\n\n56:10.900 --> 56:11.900\nYeah.\n\n56:11.900 --> 56:21.900\nAnd you're, stop me if I, I only know so much about you, and I assume none of it is things that you don't want me to blurt into a microphone,\n\n56:21.900 --> 56:26.900\nbut your dad picked you up from the show when they were talking.\n\n56:26.900 --> 56:28.900\nYeah, he takes me here.\n\n56:28.900 --> 56:31.900\nHe drops you off, he doesn't come in to watch, he's just like, go watch that podcast.\n\n56:31.900 --> 56:33.900\nYeah, he drops me off, yeah.\n\n56:33.900 --> 56:39.900\nHe works from home, so he can pick up his stuff and work at a coffee shop or anywhere, and he likes to get out of the house.\n\n56:39.900 --> 56:42.900\nSo it's good for both of us, he definitely doesn't mind it.\n\n56:42.900 --> 56:45.900\nDo you mind talking about the situation at home?\n\n56:45.900 --> 56:46.900\nSure.\n\n56:46.900 --> 56:49.900\nIs it anxiety inducing right now?\n\n56:49.900 --> 56:59.900\nOh, no, I just kind of, I've realized, I've been, well yeah, if we want to get deep, that's fine.\n\n56:59.900 --> 57:01.900\nWhat do you think these people are craving?\n\n57:01.900 --> 57:04.900\nI just talked about other people's podcasts for 40 minutes.\n\n57:04.900 --> 57:09.900\nThere needs to be bloodshed, or they're going to be like, I want my $8, $10 back.\n\n57:09.900 --> 57:13.900\nWell, yeah, I mean, life has been weird for a while.\n\n57:13.900 --> 57:18.900\nIn senior year, I went into like a half-homeschool program that turned out to be the worst thing for me,\n\n57:18.900 --> 57:22.900\nbecause there was no structure, so I barely graduated.\n\n57:22.900 --> 57:24.900\nShould have gone full homeschool.\n\n57:24.900 --> 57:27.900\nThat's a joke at the expense of our public school system.\n\n57:27.900 --> 57:28.900\nOh, yeah.\n\n57:28.900 --> 57:31.900\nNo, I should have definitely stated it.\n\n57:31.900 --> 57:34.900\nJust for me, just for me, homeschool can be great.\n\n57:34.900 --> 57:36.900\nThat's a real criticism of her parents' homeschooling ability.\n\n57:36.900 --> 57:41.900\nNo, because it was on me, because it was a half-homeschool program where the students kind of decided their own curriculum's almost,\n\n57:41.900 --> 57:46.900\nand a lot of them did really well, because there were kind of different kind of kids, and a lot of them were geniuses and stuff,\n\n57:46.900 --> 57:50.900\nbut for me, it did not work. I needed structure, and yeah.\n\n57:50.900 --> 57:53.900\nYou mean a lot of these programs typically go well, because you're referring to other kids?\n\n57:53.900 --> 57:58.900\nNo, I just meant mine. I don't know about other ones, but homeschool can be really good for certain people.\n\n57:58.900 --> 58:00.900\nOkay, yeah.\n\n58:00.900 --> 58:03.900\nUsually kids that are like, they could be two grades ahead,\n\n58:03.900 --> 58:08.900\nor they're really, really interested in a super specific thing, and really good at it, or things like that.\n\n58:08.900 --> 58:13.900\nDo you have recourse to therapy? Are you in any kind of therapy?\n\n58:13.900 --> 58:14.900\nYeah.\n\n58:14.900 --> 58:16.900\nYeah, I've been in therapy for like two years.\n\n58:16.900 --> 58:20.900\nWell, I've been in and out of therapy since I was like a kid, but I've had one.\n\n58:20.900 --> 58:25.900\nThat person probably tells you not to blame yourself for, like, a lot, right?\n\n58:25.900 --> 58:26.900\nYes.\n\n58:26.900 --> 58:34.900\nYeah, yeah. I get guilty about kind of like being the way I am or something, or I kind of used to,\n\n58:34.900 --> 58:39.900\nand she tries to tell me like, no, it makes sense why you are, how you are, and it doesn't matter anyway.\n\n58:39.900 --> 58:44.900\nI try to be, sometimes I'll be like, why is this thing, you know, about me, and great grammar,\n\n58:44.900 --> 58:50.900\nand she'll be like, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that it's like here and what we do about it,\n\n58:50.900 --> 58:55.900\nand if we accept it or if we try to get rid of it or whatever, it doesn't matter how or why things are the way they are.\n\n58:55.900 --> 58:58.900\nYeah, that's a very religious question.\n\n58:58.900 --> 59:01.900\nOh, I guess it's kind of existential.\n\n59:01.900 --> 59:03.900\nYeah. Why am I having this problem? Like, yeah.\n\n59:03.900 --> 59:06.900\nThat is really existential. I've thought about that a lot. Yeah.\n\n59:06.900 --> 59:12.900\nI like that aspect of modern therapy, that there's been a swing into the focus on the concept of happiness,\n\n59:12.900 --> 59:20.900\nand that, like, that my therapist is constantly saying, because I'll accidentally ask her, like,\n\n59:20.900 --> 59:23.900\nI don't know, should I do this or should I do that, or some kind of question that's more subjective,\n\n59:23.900 --> 59:27.900\nand she'll go, look, I don't know, I'm your mechanic, I'm here to make you happy.\n\n59:27.900 --> 59:28.900\nOh, interesting.\n\n59:28.900 --> 59:33.900\nRight, like, it's like, like, like, that's the goal is for me to be happy,\n\n59:33.900 --> 59:38.900\nnot for me to be a good person necessarily, although those things tend to go hand in hand,\n\n59:38.900 --> 59:43.900\nbecause if you have a definition of good person and you achieve it, you're probably going to be happier\n\n59:43.900 --> 59:46.900\nthan if you live in defiance of your concept of goodness.\n\n59:46.900 --> 59:51.900\nYeah, well, that's my thing too, is that I have extremely high moral standards, just for myself,\n\n59:51.900 --> 59:58.900\nnot even for anybody other than myself, but despite the fact that I don't think I come anywhere close\n\n59:58.900 --> 01:00:02.900\nto meeting those or even other people's standards, I'm constantly told all the time,\n\n01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.900\nmostly by my therapist, that I'm too hard on myself and that I'm too critical,\n\n01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.900\nand I'm like, really, are you sure?\n\n01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:11.900\nLike, you know, are you sure I shouldn't be harder on myself even than I am?\n\n01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.900\nAnd she's just like, no.\n\n01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.900\nBut yeah, what was I gonna...\n\n01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:24.900\nYeah, for me, it's usually pretty much everything I've ever had that I brought into therapy has been like,\n\n01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:29.900\nit's okay, though, like, you know, it's not that big a deal or kind of like, and not in a fake way,\n\n01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:34.900\nbut really just like, no, that's fine, like, it's okay, or I don't know.\n\n01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:39.900\nI almost, I detect a tone in your voice that's like, if you're like me, that's a little dissatisfying.\n\n01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.900\nYou want some good wills to get hunted.\n\n01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.900\nYes.\n\n01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.900\nYou want epiphanies, you want to do dramatic work.\n\n01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.900\nI was crazy, yeah.\n\n01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:54.900\nI spent a lot, I did what my first 10 therapists, I would very often pull out the insult challenge,\n\n01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:58.900\nwas like, look, I've been here three times, like, what do you get paid to do?\n\n01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.900\nI'm still fucking crazy.\n\n01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.900\nYou know what, yeah, what my problem is is that I'm extremely self-aware,\n\n01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.900\nso I'll go into therapists and I'll explain all these things about myself,\n\n01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:09.900\nand you know, I think it could be caused by this thing, and I think this might be a way to fix it and blah, blah, blah,\n\n01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:13.900\nand I'm like, and people are noticing this about me, and that's not the way I was,\n\n01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.900\nthey're just like, I don't know what to do.\n\n01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:17.900\nYeah.\n\n01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:24.900\nThat's why my current therapist is really good, and I don't know, she's very honest as far as I can tell at least.\n\n01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.900\nOr very good at being dishonest.\n\n01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:28.900\nExactly.\n\n01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:32.900\nWhat did she do for all our therapists listening?\n\n01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:39.900\nWhat did she do, what was like a moment when you were like, okay, you're off the chopping block,\n\n01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:46.900\nor okay, I'm gonna maybe come up or down to your level, but in any case, like, work with you a little bit here,\n\n01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:50.900\nas opposed to like, when is this bitch gonna help me kind of?\n\n01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:54.900\nAt first, I thought she was kind of too hard on me sometimes, even though again, I think I'm hard on myself,\n\n01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:58.900\nwhen other people are hard on me, I'm still like, well, don't do that, you know?\n\n01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.900\nWell, that's, yeah, I mean...\n\n01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:01.900\nDon't call me out on things.\n\n01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:02.900\nThat's the thing though.\n\n01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.900\nI mean, Sarah Silverman was the first person to point that out to me,\n\n01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:11.900\nlike, self-loathing, self-loving, like, it's about you, and like, nobody's more defensive than someone at self-loathing.\n\n01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:17.900\nYou're like, I'm just a poopy pants, and someone goes like, well, you do have a little bit of poop in your pants,\n\n01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.900\nand you're like, you're a fucking asshole.\n\n01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.900\nLike, you're all the more outrageous.\n\n01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:25.900\nYou're like, I just shot myself, and you're shooting me through the hole?\n\n01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.900\nExactly, exactly.\n\n01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.900\nIt's outrageous.\n\n01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:29.900\nI know.\n\n01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:34.900\nYeah, I think at first I thought maybe she was a little bit too much of a person that was very blunt,\n\n01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:41.900\nand I don't know, didn't want to like, sugarcoat or whatever, and it's like, I don't know, I like people to be genuine,\n\n01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.900\nbut when it's like a therapist, I don't like if they're like, kind of, hard on me,\n\n01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:49.900\nand I think she got to a point where she is still like that, and she doesn't sugarcoat things,\n\n01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:56.900\nbut she's learned that I respond to positivity and not negativity, so she's kind of just learned who I am and what I need,\n\n01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.900\nand that some people need to be like, they need to have a kick in the butt,\n\n01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.900\nbut then some people need to have a little hope of like, you can do it.\n\n01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.900\nIt really depends on the person what's going to actually motivate you.\n\n01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:14.900\nI think my therapist, the threshold for me was when it was finally set out loud,\n\n01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:22.900\nbecause when it comes to drinking, everybody else other than me is a square.\n\n01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:30.900\nThey don't understand what I understand about drinking my relationship with it,\n\n01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:36.900\nand I get nervous when squares get into that territory,\n\n01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.900\nand then I get nervous about getting nervous about getting nervous,\n\n01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.900\nbecause squares react to you getting nervous about the subject of you drinking\n\n01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:50.900\nthe way that they've read on the Milton Bradley box for playing talk to an alcoholic\n\n01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:54.900\nthat's just like, denial's the first line, and it's like, yeah, okay, so,\n\n01:03:54.900 --> 01:04:03.900\nand then you get nervous about it, and it just took a really long time of cat and mouse with her bringing up my drinking,\n\n01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:11.900\nwhere I was on one hand not willing to talk about it with her,\n\n01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.900\nbut on the other hand, not willing to not be willing to talk about it,\n\n01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.900\nbecause I didn't want to fuel either of those furnaces,\n\n01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:24.900\nand then there was just some crucial conversation we had where maybe she finally figured out\n\n01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:29.900\nthat what she needed to do was promise me that she was never going to ask me to stop drinking,\n\n01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:32.900\nwhich you would think would be a horrible thing to do,\n\n01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:37.900\nbecause you either have to stop or you don't, but because she finally said that,\n\n01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:42.900\nI've now had so many more conversations about something that's so fundamental to my psychology,\n\n01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.900\nwhich was my relationship with self-medication,\n\n01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.900\nthan I ever would have with anybody who, no matter how noble their purpose was,\n\n01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.900\nwas just going to take a position of like, well, let's talk about your drinking,\n\n01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:57.900\nand she finally, you know, just like a cowboy coming up to a spooked horse, you know,\n\n01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:05.900\nit's just like the horse needs to know you're not going to throw a saddle on it, which you are.\n\n01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:09.900\nBut, you know, honestly, Dave Kline's not here, is he?\n\n01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:14.900\nBecause otherwise, there would have been seven upes by now.\n\n01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.900\nBut Dave Kline, my physical therapist, if you will,\n\n01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:22.900\nlike the guy that comes and watches me do tummy crunches.\n\n01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:26.900\nWell, that's a pretty pejorative description of my occupation.\n\n01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.900\nThe guy that makes me do tummy crunches.\n\n01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.900\nBut it's like, early on...\n\n01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.900\nWas that me again?\n\n01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:37.900\nEarly on, there was a lot of weird...\n\n01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:42.900\nBecause I Instagram live all of it, and there's probably an archive of it where like,\n\n01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.900\nI was like, so...\n\n01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.900\nLike, that was like this control freak barrier.\n\n01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:52.900\nLike, I don't want another person being able to come into my home\n\n01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:58.900\nand just tell me to do more sit-ups if I feel like I've done enough.\n\n01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:05.900\nIt's like, it just, like, it hits this nerve, not laziness.\n\n01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.900\nBut something beyond that where it's like,\n\n01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.900\nI think it goes back to just being afraid on the playground of like,\n\n01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.900\nguys that were good at football or something like that.\n\n01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.900\nBut anyways, like, now that I think about it, it's like the exact same thing.\n\n01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:23.900\nTrust is so powerful and rare.\n\n01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:26.900\nI just got to a point in therapy...\n\n01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.900\nRemember when I promised you wouldn't be able to talk forever?\n\n01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:34.900\nI just got to a point in therapy where it's...\n\n01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:35.900\nIt's like, there's so much shit.\n\n01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.900\nIt was like such a sink full of dishes to do that I was so unenthused about.\n\n01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:42.900\nLike, can we get to this fundamental stuff?\n\n01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:45.900\nAnd it's like, no, you can't do that stuff.\n\n01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.900\nThere's fucking macaroni stuck to this tray.\n\n01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:49.900\nYes, it's been there forever.\n\n01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:54.900\nYes, you don't think it's important, but let's soak this shit and all that blah blah blah.\n\n01:06:54.900 --> 01:07:01.900\nAnd I finally now just started to have conversations with her about the fact that I don't have intimate relationships.\n\n01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:09.900\nLike, I have lovers and then I have my kind of round table of musketeers.\n\n01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:15.900\nMetaphore mix kind of intentional because it's like, what are we?\n\n01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.900\nI work with my friends.\n\n01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.900\nThere's always, like, it's always a business.\n\n01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.900\nThere's always an exit, you know, available.\n\n01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.900\nI don't have these friendships that I see portrayed in movies and television,\n\n01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:34.900\nlet alone described in hallmark cards, but I also don't know if those are real.\n\n01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.900\nBut like, I don't, it's like trust.\n\n01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:44.900\nLike, I don't want anybody to be able to, like, hurt me.\n\n01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:50.900\nIt's very generic sounding stuff, but like, it's so fucking profound to me.\n\n01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:54.900\nLike, I can't just like, Spencer and I were talking about this when we were walking in New York.\n\n01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.900\nAbout vulnerability.\n\n01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:59.900\nYeah, Dan also talks about that a lot on the podcast that comes out next time.\n\n01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.900\nI think it was a really valuable thing.\n\n01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:03.900\nNot that this podcast is there for worthless.\n\n01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.900\nNo, this one's better.\n\n01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.900\nI think this was money well spent.\n\n01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.900\nI think it's good you guys drove to a bad neighborhood.\n\n01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.900\nYeah, thanks so much.\n\n01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:16.900\nI just, how do you, because Spencer kind of spontaneously offered me while we were walking and talking about it.\n\n01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:24.900\nHe had this like, you know, odd personal visual metaphor for his heart.\n\n01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:25.900\nLike a mental image.\n\n01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:28.900\nAnd he was like, I know it's weird, but I see my heart like this.\n\n01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:32.900\nAnd I was like, oh, no, I see my heart in an incredibly specific way too.\n\n01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:36.900\nDo you have an image in your head of how your heart works?\n\n01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.900\nMaybe sometimes I think about it.\n\n01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:40.900\nI think more how my brain works.\n\n01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:44.900\nBut like when people hurt your feelings and stuff.\n\n01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:53.900\nLike the way, yeah, the, the paths in and out, like if you pictured like your feelings as being like in the center of your chest.\n\n01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:59.900\nAnd then like you had to like draw a picture with crayons of like how it works mechanically.\n\n01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:04.900\nNot pumping blood, but like letting things in and out, like letting feelings, whatever.\n\n01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:07.900\nIs there like an image that comes to mind?\n\n01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.900\nMinds a spiky clam shell.\n\n01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:17.900\nLike cloister from Pokemon with a heart in the middle.\n\n01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:20.900\nBut it used withdrawal already.\n\n01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:27.900\nIn order to give you time to think I will not, not to satisfy my fetish for talking over people.\n\n01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:32.900\nI will, I will, I will do mine and then you can maybe if you take a whack at yours.\n\n01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.900\nBut I just, it's fun.\n\n01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:49.900\nIt's been a bit of how it like I've always just had this very clear image of this very steampunk iron orb with rivets and like it's just, it's just absolutely proudly defiantly\n\n01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.900\nsealed off.\n\n01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.900\nBut powerful.\n\n01:09:54.900 --> 01:10:08.900\nAnd that it can, you know, there's very specific channels coming out of it that go out of that completely out of its vicinity because the power that's coming out of it has no place around it.\n\n01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.900\nThat would be really foolish architecture.\n\n01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:19.900\nAnd so it carries things as far away as possible where they can be used and processed and help other people.\n\n01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:38.900\nAnd but the real key is that if you're standing near it, there's no fucking way you're going to get anything but burnt or scalded or, or, or, you know, it's like, it's like a point of pride how inaccessible it is because it's like there's this feeling in my head of like that I that I took me all this time to\n\n01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.900\nreexamine where I'm like, it, that's how it should be.\n\n01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.900\nIt should be proud of that.\n\n01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.900\nIt's like playing a tower defense game.\n\n01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.900\nLike, like, like, oh, look, my inventory.\n\n01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.900\nYou can't get near it.\n\n01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:51.900\nYou shouldn't be able to.\n\n01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.900\nYou'll fuck it up.\n\n01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:58.900\nSo all right, now you go better be good.\n\n01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:03.900\nWell, I think the way that I was like, I was like, oh, I haven't, I haven't thought about my heart visually like that.\n\n01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:07.900\nBut I think the way that you're talking about your heart is I'm just really gay.\n\n01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:09.900\nI'm just really gay.\n\n01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.900\nNova.\n\n01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.900\nWhat the fuck you we're opening ourselves up.\n\n01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:18.900\nNo wonder I keep a fucking iron shell around my heart.\n\n01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.900\nYeah, homophobic attacks.\n\n01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.900\nSorry, go ahead.\n\n01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:32.900\nI think the way you're just you're thinking of your heart is maybe I've thought about my brain, but it's like maybe I feel the same way about it.\n\n01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:35.900\nWhen I think about who I am and my emotions and how I can be hurt.\n\n01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:41.900\nI'm not picturing my brain, but I think I think I probably think about it and I don't know.\n\n01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:49.900\nI got really into I got really into inside out when I came out and when it came out and not when I came out.\n\n01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:56.900\nJust in the thought of like, there's the five emotions, you know, and then they have these essences and don't forget those memory islands.\n\n01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:57.900\nGod damn it.\n\n01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.900\nThat story has problems.\n\n01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.900\nSorry, I don't mean to derail you.\n\n01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.900\nDon't get mad.\n\n01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.900\nDon't get mad.\n\n01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.900\nIt made me cry, too.\n\n01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.900\nI also cried during the movie.\n\n01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:13.900\nI'm not stomping on your garden and going, there's nothing of value here.\n\n01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:15.900\nNo, yeah.\n\n01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:20.900\nWell, because it's also like a real psychology concept of there being like five emotions and stuff.\n\n01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:25.900\nAnd I think I think of myself as a very emotional being and a person of sort of moods and flavors and whatnot.\n\n01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:33.900\nThat sounds stupid, but I think maybe if I were to picture like my heart, it would be sort of a swirling essence of different colors and maybe sort of like smoke.\n\n01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:34.900\nI don't know.\n\n01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:35.900\nLike I've thought about like aura.\n\n01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:42.900\nI've been told by like more than one person, like that my aura is purple, which is, I mean, that's like two people.\n\n01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.900\nSo it's not like, oh, that's the craziest coincidence ever.\n\n01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:46.900\nLike it must be real, but.\n\n01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.900\nNo, it's purple.\n\n01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.900\nDamn.\n\n01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.900\nJeff, do you see auras?\n\n01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:54.900\nNo.\n\n01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.900\nI believe that.\n\n01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:56.900\nIt's psychic.\n\n01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:57.900\nJust nervous.\n\n01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.900\nIs it purple a good one?\n\n01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.900\nI guess there's not a lot of bad aura.\n\n01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:06.900\nThey describe the people who've told me out of purple auras that it's like sort of cosmic.\n\n01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:14.900\nIt's like kind of different out there and like, I don't know, loving or bright or something, which is sounds really, really narcissistic coming from my own self.\n\n01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.900\nBut yeah, I don't know.\n\n01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.900\nI think I would think of it as just sort of a thing of feelings and different things.\n\n01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:20.900\nAnd I don't know.\n\n01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:25.900\nI kind of match things up in my head of sort of like, oh, these things all have the same essence or the same vibe.\n\n01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.900\nAnd that's just sort of the way I think about things more than like concrete things.\n\n01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.900\nThat sounds healthier.\n\n01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.900\nLess practical, but that's okay.\n\n01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:37.900\nI think it's interesting that things get more complicated when you get up to your brain.\n\n01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:44.900\nAnd the reason I will Dan explain that I find that interesting is because I don't feel that way at all.\n\n01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:53.900\nIt's like the brain for me is like, get up there like where you can just run your fucking mouth and for better or for worse, it'll all come out and wash and all this stuff.\n\n01:13:53.900 --> 01:14:00.900\nHowever, and I know you don't want to be, you know, laser focused on as a representative of anything or whatever.\n\n01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:12.900\nBut the thing that makes you different from me is that at some point in your life you started to feel conflicted about identity in a way that is absolutely incompatible with like neurotypical mainstream society.\n\n01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:22.900\nWhereas I never had to think about myself as anything but a fucking cool rebel, even though I was just like, because I never woke up going,\n\n01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:34.900\nthere's a thought in here that according to that Miller light billboard is criminal or like cruising for a bruising or maybe I shouldn't have.\n\n01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.900\nMaybe I need to just get through it and all this stuff.\n\n01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:50.900\nAnd so it's like, it's, it's, it's terrifying for me to think about the brain, which for me is like, get up to your strong corner, get away from your heart as like the place that is actually needs to be towered,\n\n01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:52.900\nand organized and.\n\n01:14:52.900 --> 01:15:07.900\nYeah, well, I think that that maybe come from sort of that might come from sort of like how well because like, I mean, that's kind of why things have been so weird for me lately is because it was only like a couple months ago,\n\n01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:13.900\nlike probably less than six months ago or around that when I got diagnosed with autism by my therapist.\n\n01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:21.900\nAnd because she'd, she hadn't said anything, but I think she knew about it kind of like with your therapist where it's like she finally felt okay, bring up the drinking one day I came in and I was like,\n\n01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:22.900\nokay, come on.\n\n01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:33.900\nEver since I was as long as I can form memories, I can remember people being like, oh, you're kind of different or knowing that I'm kind of different or just being kind of different and all these stupid tiny little ways,\n\n01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:40.900\nyou know, that I'm like, okay, but like nobody else I know is thinking that way, even if it seems like a small thing.\n\n01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.900\nLike it's just sort of like this thing that is all of me.\n\n01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.900\nIt's not like one particular thing about me.\n\n01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:57.900\nSo then when she said that and I kind of absorbed it and everything was like, okay, because yes, like you said, I guess what would be different about us is that as long as I can remember,\n\n01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:08.900\nI've thought about like who I am and like how I'm different from other people and I don't know how I'm the same and stuff and yeah, I've always been kind of analyzing like who I am and what I am.\n\n01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:18.900\nAnd I've never been able to kind of bring any sort of practicality to that of like a lot of kids like act different to avoid being bullied.\n\n01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:23.900\nI mean, I wasn't bullied too bad, but it never even occurred to me that I could try being different.\n\n01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.900\nLike I was like, well, okay, this is it.\n\n01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:32.900\nThen I get bullied then or this is how I try to make them stop the bullying, but it never occurred to me to ever be anything other than what I am.\n\n01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:38.900\nAnd now that I'm like 20 and thinking about trying to maybe get a job and stuff.\n\n01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:48.900\nI'm thinking like, oh, well, do I have to enter into a world where I'm not going to be able to be me and I'm going to have to do practical things or something and I don't know.\n\n01:16:48.900 --> 01:17:14.900\nI think that's like the one thing I love about the autistic community is that like humanity itself in a really magnified way, precisely because there is a deprivation of objective truth that comes more easy to typical people that or in the case of if you look at humanity\n\n01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.900\nand it's like easy for a skunk to know if it's doing what it should be doing.\n\n01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.900\nIt's easy for a giraffe.\n\n01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:22.900\nFucking giraffes.\n\n01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:26.900\nNo, shout out to giraffes who are like dying in Griffith Park Zoo right now.\n\n01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:30.900\nLet's not be mean.\n\n01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:31.900\nI don't think it's a zoo anymore.\n\n01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:32.900\nSharks are great.\n\n01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.900\nWhatever.\n\n01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.900\nDon't derail me.\n\n01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:35.900\nI'm on a fucking roll.\n\n01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:36.900\nCan't you hear this?\n\n01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:55.900\nBut as we talked to our friend Steve Silverman who wrote Neurotribes that within humanity that people who have autistic traits also are like, they're like, well, wait, what am I?\n\n01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:10.900\nI don't have this sort of like compulsion for these sort of like easy truths or whatever. But because of that, even as uncomfortable as it feels, this is dance-plating autism, dance-plating everything to you.\n\n01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:14.900\nBut this is just, I just find this to be a very romantic and wonderful concept.\n\n01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:30.900\nBecause of that, there's an increased attention on it. There may not be what feels like facile awareness, and that can feel so alienating and so sad that it's like, it's that Pinocchio syndrome thing, which, you know, autistic people, it looks like they hate and television stuff.\n\n01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:34.900\nThey hate like neurotypicals going like, oh, bleep, bloop, just wants to be human.\n\n01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:45.900\nBut at the same time, at the core of that is this idea of I am separate, so like you wake up the same as everything and don't even have to make a choice.\n\n01:18:45.900 --> 01:19:02.900\nHere I am wondering who the fuck I am. Those people have this power to examine the things that other people take for granted and go, you know, then that's why I think this tradition of like creatives and artists and things.\n\n01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:10.900\nI'm going to make Calvin and Hobbes because I don't know what the fuck it means to be this or that. I don't mean to diagnose that guy, but anyways.\n\n01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.900\nWell, I think I haven't really heard that specific take on autism, which is really interesting.\n\n01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.900\nI fucking coined it.\n\n01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:31.900\nBut I've heard that a lot about being trans, because gender is so deeply ingrained in our society and from the smallest to the biggest ways that if you think I'm not that, what everything seems to be, it's like, oh, I feel like I'm starting from scratch.\n\n01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:35.900\nI feel like I'm starting from scratch or something and all these personality traits.\n\n01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:42.900\nI have to like, yeah, you examine things more and you don't like feel like you can fall into easily defined things.\n\n01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:53.900\nYeah, thank God for people going like finally like, hey, you know what, there actually is such a thing as somebody that doesn't even can't doesn't know like you want to play some duck duck goose game.\n\n01:19:53.900 --> 01:20:15.900\nMaybe duck, maybe goose, maybe both. I'd like, like, why don't we ask that? Like, and of course you're going to get those tomatoes thrown at you. But like, it is such a, it's like, it makes every single person at every bachelorette party, every construction site, these archetypes we conjure of the most binary committed people,\n\n01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:35.900\nmy, myself included, like, after all the reaction of like, well, what's next? Come on. Then, then thought has to happen just for the fuck of it, even, you know, I can start as like, what you think is punching down curiosity is like, all right, well, let me get this straight.\n\n01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:55.900\nThose roads can at least lead to inspection, because I think it's such an important thing for that reason. It's like a skeleton key to all this other shit, because also as I've said, like, and I don't know if this is offensive to people, but, but I'll learn that it is for for the reason I learned it\n\n01:20:55.900 --> 01:21:09.900\nbut I've always thought in the back of my head, you know, there's never going to be a million trans movement, literally, just, it's never going to be, it's never going to be this thing that we're used to, which is like, numbers, numbers, numbers.\n\n01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:27.900\nAnd good, because we've entered a world where that numbers are not what are making things change, sometimes catastrophically, it can take one troll and 20 bots to fuck up an entire thing that actually is a pillar of society or whatever.\n\n01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:52.900\nWe need to actually graduate beyond the populist idea of democracy where it's like, well, if you're a million people, you're less important to two million people and get into like, okay, we got to make sure we have to have an acid test and it can come down to one individual, which is more, you know, I think, I think it's not only more liberal,\n\n01:21:52.900 --> 01:22:07.900\nit's also, I think that it's more practical in terms of becoming a planet of eight billion people that are all connected telepathically and trying to get the fuck off of burning cinder that they've eaten all the giraffes off of.\n\n01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:28.900\nWe're going to have to have a fundamental respect for humans and we're not going to be able to continue to have curveballs, you know, like we can't, the shot clock is so near zero, we cannot continue to go, okay, it's okay that you're black, but now let's get back to work.\n\n01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:42.900\nWhat, you're a woman, that's, get out of here, like we got to stop being so thrown by people saying, I over here, table five needs bread.\n\n01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:54.900\nWe can't keep going like close the restaurant, fuck you, why are you eating here, what's food, should we make it illegal, we have to just get to a place where we're like, table five needs bread, got it, it's a terrible metaphor.\n\n01:22:54.900 --> 01:23:20.900\nI think I get it though, yeah, I think it's pretty insane, although also just knowing about the nature of humans or something, like I think, I mean, like it makes sense logically, but if you think, like if I really think about it, it just, it makes, it's so insane to me like the rules we've created and how many rules are created.\n\n01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:40.900\nWe think of like, oh, the fifties were insane, you know, you had to have your fork on the right, that's crazy, I'll have my fork on the left, but it's like we're still have so many deeply ingrained things that go way beyond where you put your fork, like what a harmless, you know, rule to have in your society, but there's deeper ones that are harmful or not harmful.\n\n01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:41.900\nLike racism.\n\n01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:43.900\nYeah, but there's also like little things.\n\n01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:44.900\nJust to name a few.\n\n01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:55.900\nYeah, there's, there's things that are really, really big and really bad like that, but there's also like little things that it's weird that it's a rule, but on such a large scale.\n\n01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:56.900\nI don't know.\n\n01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:01.900\nYeah, you get indoctrinated into shit and everybody wants to be a good person pretty much.\n\n01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:14.900\nAnd you go like, okay, now if I put my fork on the wrong side, I'm called an anti hero, I'm called a, an upstart, I'm called a kind of like cool person.\n\n01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:18.900\nAnd but it's like, that can be taught to you as a child.\n\n01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:31.900\nAnd then that person precisely because in reference back to me getting offended with in the midst of, in the midst of myself deprecation, somebody suggests that I'm a bad person, I get mad at them and abuse them.\n\n01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:44.900\nThat is the problem with kind of like institutionalized liberalism, for instance, where you go, hey, I'm a liberal, I voted for this, I understand that racism is bad.\n\n01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:52.900\nHere's how racism is defined, here's whether I'm sexist, here's whether I've ever sexually harassed anyone, here's whether I'm an advocate of this community or that.\n\n01:24:52.900 --> 01:25:00.900\nAnd don't, and then someone says, hey man, what you did there was a little disrespectful and you bite their fucking head off because what am I a Nazi?\n\n01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.900\nHow dare you and all that stuff.\n\n01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:06.900\nAnd I think that it's that illustrates this wall that you're talking about.\n\n01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:17.900\nAnd instead of this process that we've, it has been fine because it's moved at a speed faster than the average caveman, which is like, build the wall here.\n\n01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.900\nOkay, wall needs to be torn down.\n\n01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.900\nWe're going to move it 20 feet out, everybody.\n\n01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:22.900\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:23.900\nGrumble, grumble.\n\n01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:26.900\nNow it's harder to get to work, grumble, grumble, but nothing collapses.\n\n01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.900\nWe're hitting this tipping point now where the walls are digital, and so is the road to work.\n\n01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:33.900\nAnd so is the path to democracy.\n\n01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:47.900\nSo is the, and it's like, holy shit, if we can't get it through our head, that just in general, take it, take it as it comes and don't allow yourself to be fucking thrown by other people.\n\n01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:57.900\nWe're, if we don't, if we don't upgrade that firmware to where we don't have to have a fucking forum, I'm repeating myself, like we're going to, we're going to die.\n\n01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:02.900\nAnyways, in the news today, we probably are already dying.\n\n01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:03.900\nYeah.\n\n01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:06.900\nYou were prompted to raise your, you were compelled to raise your hand.\n\n01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:07.900\nFor a while now.\n\n01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:08.900\nI just had a question.\n\n01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:13.900\nHas your therapist ever asked you if you want to be depressed?\n\n01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:20.900\nThe question was, has my therapist, has any, has we both answered it?\n\n01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:23.900\nHas your therapist ever asked you if you want to be depressed?\n\n01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:27.900\nNo, she never has, but I've asked, I've always wondered that.\n\n01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:29.900\nAsk her if she can ask you that.\n\n01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.900\nThat could be fun.\n\n01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:38.900\nWell, you've talked about how you are like really comfortable with being unhappy, you know, or comfortable being depressed or being alcoholic or something.\n\n01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:39.900\nRight.\n\n01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:44.900\nSo I got, yeah, actually, I hadn't put it in that context, but in that sense, very much so.\n\n01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:47.900\nShe's definitely like lowered that challenge or rather warning.\n\n01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:56.900\nSounds like you're getting really close to happiness and like you, like coping with it can bring out all kinds of shit.\n\n01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:57.900\nYeah.\n\n01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:58.900\nLike I think I self sabotage.\n\n01:26:58.900 --> 01:26:59.900\nI'm terrified of success.\n\n01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:06.900\nI've tried like eating and exercising for years and years and years, but I always have this thought of like, what if everything gets better than what the fuck will I do?\n\n01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:15.900\nIt's been such a huge, huge challenge for me this last year because traditionally what I do is, oh, look, he made that thing.\n\n01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:16.900\nOh, everyone's happy.\n\n01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:20.900\nOh, they just, Annie and Jeff to get together or maybe he's going to kiss Britta.\n\n01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:21.900\nYou have a fandom.\n\n01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:22.900\nYou have people on Tumblr.\n\n01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:23.900\nThey like your show.\n\n01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:24.900\nYou're doing good.\n\n01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:25.900\nYou did it.\n\n01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:26.900\nYou did it.\n\n01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:27.900\nYou fucking monkey.\n\n01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:28.900\nYou did it.\n\n01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:29.900\nBoom.\n\n01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:30.900\nWhat's he doing?\n\n01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:36.900\nI'm like getting mad at Sony and like driving home in tears because my show is so important and how can they understand it?\n\n01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:40.900\nIt's like, you look back on that and I go like self sabotage.\n\n01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:41.900\nIt has to be.\n\n01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:45.900\nThere was never enough of a threat that I ever had to go to Def Con this or that.\n\n01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:49.900\nHowever, I still, I'm like, fuck people who say pick your battles and all that stuff.\n\n01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:59.900\nAnd this last year has been therefore like this thing where it's like, okay, you did it.\n\n01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:05.900\nYou made a successful show by all the metrics that you used to abide by.\n\n01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:13.900\nAlso, in addition to that, you're going to get recognized and rewarded for it to the point where you might die happy or whatever that fucking goal is.\n\n01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:20.900\nAnd all of a sudden it seems like you're actually being targeted unfairly.\n\n01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:32.900\nHowever, if you talk about it, it could cause enough of a shit storm to get you fired.\n\n01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:35.900\nIt would be feeding the trolls.\n\n01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:39.900\nAnd it's like, oh, wait, where does the self sabotage end?\n\n01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:45.900\nDoes it end when you stop talking about the things that upset you?\n\n01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:48.900\nBecause my mouth gets me fired a lot.\n\n01:28:48.900 --> 01:29:05.900\nAnd so one would reason if they were trying to destroy my life that it would be as easy as lobbing a dead cat into a part of the courtyard where I was bound to put on a show about it and spread disease and take my whole kingdom down.\n\n01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:12.900\nAnd so then you get into, oh, now I'm doing things because it's what the enemy doesn't want.\n\n01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:16.900\nI'm like, when did I become a fucking liar for a living?\n\n01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:20.900\nWhen did I wake up every day and go, first of all, what do you think?\n\n01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:22.900\nOkay, now what do you say?\n\n01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:24.900\nAnd have those two things be separate?\n\n01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:25.900\nIt's miserable.\n\n01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:29.900\nIt's not as miserable as anybody listening.\n\n01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:30.900\nEveryone has those problems.\n\n01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:45.900\nBut that's why it's been a weird year because I'm like, wait, you can beat the people that want to destroy you by never paying any attention to it.\n\n01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:53.900\nAnd it feels like going like this while people kick you, which I've never done.\n\n01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:56.900\nBut then again, I've never been a huge counterpuncher.\n\n01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:58.900\nI'm not like a fucking warrior.\n\n01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:01.900\nI don't go like, nobody fucks with me.\n\n01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:08.900\nWhat I do is every week I go, well, this happened today.\n\n01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.900\nSomeone wrote this about me.\n\n01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:11.900\nSomeone said this.\n\n01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:12.900\nThis is how that felt.\n\n01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:16.900\nAnd then no matter what, every day I go home, I'm like, every week, at least I recalibrate.\n\n01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:20.900\nAnd I go, well, I don't have anything bouncing around in my head anymore.\n\n01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:28.900\nBut as I keep referencing, we're a year now going into this, I'm like, what am I a fucking senator?\n\n01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:40.900\nWhere I'm like, it's like the smart thing for me to do to be polite or comported.\n\n01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:42.900\nIs that what enemies want?\n\n01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.900\nDo we live by what enemies?\n\n01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:52.900\nBut my therapist finally got there, and I did say this in New York, so I'll be repeating it.\n\n01:30:52.900 --> 01:31:06.900\nBut she finally said, so you are a 45-year-old man who has been able to say, I don't care forever.\n\n01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:08.900\nAnd now you care.\n\n01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:11.900\nAnd that's difficult.\n\n01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:22.900\nAnd it sounds really, it's a really, really unfortunate thing that the messengers of that have to be trolls, Nazis.\n\n01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.900\nAnd she didn't have to finish her thought, because then I got it.\n\n01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:25.900\nI was like, oh, yeah.\n\n01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:39.900\nSo in other words, if it weren't these stupid stories and these stupid times, like, it would be time for me to graduate from deliberately disaffected.\n\n01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:41.900\nI don't care about nothing.\n\n01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:42.900\nYou can't get near me.\n\n01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:46.900\nIt's a wonder I was married for eight months.\n\n01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:49.900\nIt's like, too, holy shit, I love someone.\n\n01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:51.900\nHoly shit, I'm proud of my job.\n\n01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:55.900\nHoly shit, I don't want to get fired.\n\n01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:57.900\nHoly shit, I don't want to hurt people.\n\n01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:03.900\nHoly shit, there are people out there that you can hurt by doing nothing.\n\n01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:08.900\nHoly shit, there are people out there that I've hurt when I thought I was the victim.\n\n01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:11.900\nBecause they didn't like me enough.\n\n01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:16.900\nHoly shit, I am part of the problem even by not being part of the problem.\n\n01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:26.900\nAnd holy shit, there are people who are lying in way, drooling for any sign of vulnerability so they can jump on me.\n\n01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:33.900\nAnd any nutsack sticking out, they will grab and twist and try to rip off because they don't even believe I'm real.\n\n01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:38.900\nAnd it's like, welcome to the party, which is not even...\n\n01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:43.900\nIt's like, let alone being famous, it's like, I think that's everyone over the age of 30.\n\n01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:52.900\nEverybody has to go to a job where they have to fucking, you know, they have to worry about, you know, like, oh, my happiness is...\n\n01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.900\nBut that's the negative way of putting it.\n\n01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:59.900\nEveryone in adulthood starts to realize what they love and what they like.\n\n01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:04.900\nAnd then the crucial key is, don't worry about whether or not to be vulnerable.\n\n01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.900\nBe honest, keep being honest.\n\n01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:14.900\nBecause if you're honest and you say, here's a nut sack, it's on my knee, and someone runs up and kicks it.\n\n01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:16.900\nOkay, ouch.\n\n01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:25.900\nBut you can't just rearrange and go like, my knee's bulletproof.\n\n01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.900\nBecause that's what nutsacks are.\n\n01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:29.900\nThey're bulletproof.\n\n01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:31.900\nAnd it's like...\n\n01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:38.900\nI want you to extend this metaphor as long as you can.\n\n01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:41.900\nWell, it's like in Red Dead Redemption.\n\n01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:43.900\nBut I really think...\n\n01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:55.900\nSo talking to this youngster here, I'm saying, like, you know, like, whatever's going on with you, you know, like...\n\n01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:58.900\nIt seems like you've got good parents because you're not...\n\n01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:04.900\nIt doesn't sound like you're a product of abuse or alienation on the home front.\n\n01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:07.900\nYou have a dad that's dropping you off and picking you up here.\n\n01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:14.900\nAnd that could be a higher challenge because you don't have anybody to blame but yourself.\n\n01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:17.900\nAnd then you don't know what that's supposed to mean and all that stuff.\n\n01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:32.900\nSo what you've got to do to maintain your sanity, I think, is connect and share and understand that you will be assailed and hurt.\n\n01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:36.900\nBut that pain isn't real.\n\n01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:39.900\nIt's real. It's a real feeling, but it's not real destruction.\n\n01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:46.900\nBecause the only real destruction is if a tentacle goes out and someone kicks it and it hurts so you recoil,\n\n01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:52.900\nwhich is what we all do in response to trauma, then that's the actual physical effect of the kick,\n\n01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:54.900\nis that there's no more tentacle there anymore.\n\n01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.900\nThat's a place where there's no more connection.\n\n01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:01.900\nBut the pain of the kick didn't actually damage the tentacle.\n\n01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:04.900\nIt's a dumb metaphor because, of course, if you kick a tentacle, you're going to damage it.\n\n01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:11.900\nNo, it's fine. It's like when you touch a snail's eye, it pops right back out.\n\n01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:18.900\nWhat's up, Raise Handy? Our new character, Handy Raise.\n\n01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:22.900\nYeah, why don't you come up and grab a mic and what's that?\n\n01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:26.900\nIt's someone's birthday.\n\n01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:31.900\nI'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at our world.\n\n01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:32.900\nCome on up, birthday.\n\n01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:34.900\nThank you so much.\n\n01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:37.900\nThree people again?\n\n01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:41.900\nI'm suddenly a fan of my podcast because I just like that idea.\n\n01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:45.900\nHe's like this, and then another person goes, just bring him up.\n\n01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:48.900\nAnd then the woman goes, it's my birthday.\n\n01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.900\nI like all of that for all reasons.\n\n01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:53.900\nI didn't mean to start anything. I just had a follow-up question.\n\n01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.900\nYeah, well, yeah, I don't think we're...\n\n01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:57.900\nWhat day's your birthday again?\n\n01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.900\n11-11. It was yesterday.\n\n01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:00.900\nHappy birthday.\n\n01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:01.900\nThanks.\n\n01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:02.900\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:03.900\nCaroline.\n\n01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:04.900\nHi.\n\n01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:05.900\nHi, Caroline.\n\n01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:07.900\nNice to meet you.\n\n01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:08.900\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:09.900\nNova.\n\n01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:10.900\nNice to meet you.\n\n01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:11.900\nDan, right.\n\n01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:13.900\nThank you very much.\n\n01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:15.900\nA birthday water?\n\n01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:16.900\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.900\nA birthday water.\n\n01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:20.900\nOh, yeah, I could use a Coke.\n\n01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:23.900\nI could use a Coke.\n\n01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:25.900\nCan of Coke.\n\n01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:29.900\nTurkey, mayo, lettuce, tomato, lightly toast.\n\n01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:30.900\nA joke.\n\n01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:31.900\nOkay, Aisa, what was your follow-up?\n\n01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:35.900\nMy follow-up question was how do you then...\n\n01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.900\nYou answered my former question of do you think that you want to be depressed?\n\n01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:45.900\nBut my follow-up was how then do you distinguish between your maladaptive behavior\n\n01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:48.900\nversus behavior that is healthy but then is punished?\n\n01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.900\nYou're talking about being honest and being upfront with people\n\n01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.900\nin big platforms like this, which seems healthy,\n\n01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:56.900\nbut then you've learned to recoil from that.\n\n01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:00.900\nSo how do you distinctify between maladaptive behaviors versus...\n\n01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:05.900\nMy theory as of the last couple of weeks that made me so relieved\n\n01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:12.900\nbecause it makes me comfortable again is that the answer is whether or not it's true.\n\n01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:17.900\nBecause that was for so long my definition of...\n\n01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:19.900\nI rubbed a mannequin leg on my nipple.\n\n01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.900\nI have a nylon fetish.\n\n01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:23.900\nI put a thing in my butt.\n\n01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:29.900\nIt's like there's no such thing as truth that should hurt you.\n\n01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.900\nThere's technically one...\n\n01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:34.900\nIf you were, for instance, a pedophile,\n\n01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:38.900\nwe have this go-to crime where we go,\n\n01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:44.900\nbecause aside from just regular rape of a non-consensual person,\n\n01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:48.900\nit's like the word pedophile is the only thing worse than anything sexually,\n\n01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:54.900\nin addition to being worse than a Nazi, or so we feel emotionally.\n\n01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:59.900\nAnd so if you weren't that,\n\n01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:03.900\nthen theoretically anything that you were,\n\n01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:08.900\nanything that you could say out loud in this country,\n\n01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:15.900\nit should not be anything that would automatically cause destruction to your life.\n\n01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:17.900\nIt could cause embarrassment,\n\n01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:21.900\nbut it shouldn't cause you actual loss of property.\n\n01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:24.900\nWell, that's really interesting, because sometimes I'll get into a space\n\n01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:27.900\nwhere I'm feeling bad about myself and then I'll ask my therapist,\n\n01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:32.900\ndo you think it's okay if I start playing this video game because I like it and stuff?\n\n01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:36.900\nI just feel really guilty about doing things that I enjoy.\n\n01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.900\nAnd one time I was just like,\n\n01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:42.900\ncan I just, like, facing adulthood,\n\n01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:45.900\nyou're like, wow, you can really do anything, mostly.\n\n01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.900\nI was like, can I just do anything I want?\n\n01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:51.900\nAnd she said, yes, well, you can, because I know that you're not going to do anything\n\n01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.900\nthat's going to destroy your life or someone else's.\n\n01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:56.900\nWell, she knew you were a hero and an addict,\n\n01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:59.900\nand you needed there for it.\n\n01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.900\nBut yeah, my therapist always said right away,\n\n01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:05.900\nif it's free and fun, do it.\n\n01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:08.900\nYeah, if you're not hurting anybody or yourself is what mine says, yeah.\n\n01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:12.900\nYeah, and so that is the answer to Ace's question,\n\n01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:15.900\nwhich is like, I have the luxury,\n\n01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:18.900\nmy heart goes out to people who aren't in these shoes,\n\n01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:22.900\nhence the episode where I went to bat for a bit of violence.\n\n01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:26.900\nIt was like 100 episodes ago where I'd seen that Pervert Park documentary,\n\n01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:28.900\nand I was like, God damn it, that must suck,\n\n01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:31.900\nbecause I can't control my sexuality.\n\n01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:35.900\nSo what if you couldn't and your sexuality was literally illegal\n\n01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:38.900\nand literally involved hurting people?\n\n01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:44.900\nShouldn't we spare a thought for treatment and whatnot to break the cycle?\n\n01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:53.900\nBut I have the luxury of, like, as bad as it gets is what you see,\n\n01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:56.900\nwhich is like, I just fascinated with myself,\n\n01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:00.900\nand I like toes on my nipple, and I like girls in pantyhose,\n\n01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:05.900\nand I like everything that I've talked about for 300 episodes of this podcast,\n\n01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:08.900\nwhich means I have that privilege of,\n\n01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:13.900\nif I just dump everything from my brain out of my mouth,\n\n01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:17.900\nthen along the way, the worst I can do is use the wrong pronoun,\n\n01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:21.900\nsay the n-word, these sort of like, kind of like verbal gaffes that could be...\n\n01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:22.900\nSocial contracts?\n\n01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:26.900\nBut you'd have to be, you'd have to desire to destroy me\n\n01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:31.900\nto then take those mistakes and go,\n\n01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.900\ntherefore we should destroy this person, you know?\n\n01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:41.900\nLike, and that I think is the reality that we have to cope with,\n\n01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:46.900\nwhich is if somebody wants to hurt you,\n\n01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:51.900\nthere's no way to beat them in the game of I'm hurtable,\n\n01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:56.900\nand it's not a victory to be unhurtable.\n\n01:40:56.900 --> 01:41:00.900\nIt's not a victory to have a shield around you\n\n01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:04.900\nand turrets that keep people from coming near your front lawn.\n\n01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:10.900\nThat is not a way to die laughing at everybody\n\n01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:14.900\nsaying, I had the perfect life, you will die with a vague feeling,\n\n01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:19.900\nprobably of deep unease and sadness.\n\n01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:23.900\nBecause when my therapist said that,\n\n01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:26.900\nshe was like, she would be the last person that I would think,\n\n01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:29.900\nafter everything that she's heard,\n\n01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:33.900\nto recommend that I continue to do this podcast.\n\n01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:37.900\nI would never have thought.\n\n01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:40.900\nI would think that she would have been like, yeah,\n\n01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:42.900\nthat seems like an unhealthy fixation you have on yourself,\n\n01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:45.900\nand maybe now that you're growing you should retire the microphone\n\n01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:49.900\nand go live in a normal person, it's time.\n\n01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:55.900\nBut she was like, you need to be honest.\n\n01:41:55.900 --> 01:42:00.900\nAnd the more honest you are, the stronger you feel and are,\n\n01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:07.900\nand the more helpful you are.\n\n01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:10.900\nI've answered your question 90 times.\n\n01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:12.900\nThat's the path.\n\n01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:15.900\nIt's maladaptive, healthy, unhealthy, who knows.\n\n01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:17.900\nI've been up here and being defensive about it.\n\n01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:20.900\nI was up here for more episodes than not saying,\n\n01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:22.900\nI hate therapy, I don't believe in therapy.\n\n01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:24.900\nI've been up here saying, don't vote, your vote doesn't matter.\n\n01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:26.900\nThen I've been up here saying, we should run out in the street\n\n01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:29.900\nand kill Nazis.\n\n01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:33.900\nReally, who cares, quote, unquote,\n\n01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:38.900\nwhether the behaviors and thoughts are healthy, unhealthy,\n\n01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:43.900\nor leading down the yellow brick road or a dirt path\n\n01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:45.900\nthat makes Dorothy a cyborg.\n\n01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:49.900\nHowever, which arguably sounds like a cooler story\n\n01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:53.900\nthan one where it turns out you could go home at any time\n\n01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:55.900\nand the bad guy can get killed with water.\n\n01:42:55.900 --> 01:43:01.900\nBut what's important is for me, maybe not for other people,\n\n01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:07.900\nbut for me, it's vital that I got to be saying what I'm thinking,\n\n01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:10.900\nor I'll put a gun in my mouth.\n\n01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:13.900\nThat's why I'm so...\n\n01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:15.900\nThat's why I'm so...\n\n01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:18.900\nTraditionally, I've been so adamant about...\n\n01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:20.900\nEvery time we mention suicide in the show,\n\n01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:25.900\nyou notice I always have this kids talk to somebody, et cetera,\n\n01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:32.900\nbecause before I started this seemingly self-destructive practice\n\n01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:36.900\nof speaking into a microphone about everything that's going on with me,\n\n01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:40.900\na behavior that has gotten me fired more than it's gotten me hired,\n\n01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:44.900\na behavior that at times seems like you just wish it would stop\n\n01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:49.900\nbecause if he would just stop doing it, then everything would be fine.\n\n01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:54.900\nShut up, Dan, but for me, maybe not for other people,\n\n01:43:54.900 --> 01:44:02.900\nit's like these thoughts in your skull,\n\n01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:06.900\nthey bounce off every interior surface,\n\n01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:12.900\nand every time they do, they accrue thoughts about them,\n\n01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:17.900\nand they just get so big, so fast.\n\n01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:20.900\nAnd then as soon as they come out of your mouth,\n\n01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:23.900\nit doesn't matter if people applaud, it doesn't matter if people boo,\n\n01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:25.900\nit doesn't matter if they ignore it,\n\n01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:29.900\nthe important thing that happens is it came out,\n\n01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:31.900\nand now it's gone.\n\n01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:33.900\nI've found that over and over again.\n\n01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:35.900\nIt's just like, boom.\n\n01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:43.900\nIt's like, I said, I stuck a Sharpie pen up my ass once\n\n01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:46.900\nbecause I wanted to see if it would make me come harder,\n\n01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:51.900\nand for the rest of my life, that Sharpie pen has no power over me,\n\n01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:54.900\nit doesn't matter if the audience went,\n\n01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:57.900\nyay, let's go buy stock and Sharpie,\n\n01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:00.900\nit doesn't matter if they say, you're so brave,\n\n01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:04.900\nit doesn't matter, it's like, what matters is that I didn't die.\n\n01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:08.900\nIt's kind of like, I mean, so I had sex with my third grade teacher,\n\n01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:12.900\nto get an A, and I too was homeschooled, so it was really...\n\n01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:14.900\nDamn.\n\n01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:17.900\nIs that a genuine story from your life?\n\n01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:18.900\nYeah, her mom.\n\n01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:19.900\nKind of?\n\n01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:22.900\nNo, I'm joking.\n\n01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:24.900\nWhat you're talking about?\n\n01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:31.900\nWell, it's your birthday, you're allowed to run through the fields of incest.\n\n01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:32.900\nI just want to say something.\n\n01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:35.900\nI just want to say something memorable.\n\n01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:39.900\nWhat you're talking about is exactly what I've been working on in therapy,\n\n01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.900\nwhich is why I was so curious,\n\n01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:44.900\nsomething that my therapist told me recently,\n\n01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:46.900\nthat was actually one of those big revelation moments,\n\n01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:49.900\nwas that you're not always trying to fix yourself,\n\n01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:53.900\nsometimes you're just trying to learn to be okay.\n\n01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:54.900\nRight.\n\n01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:57.900\nIn therapy, at least I'm always trying to be like,\n\n01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:59.900\nso I feel this way about this,\n\n01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:01.900\nand I think sort of like you were talking about earlier, Nova,\n\n01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:03.900\nI feel this way about this, and I think it's because of this,\n\n01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:05.900\nand I think if I thought about it this way,\n\n01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.900\nthen everything would be fine,\n\n01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.900\nbut sometimes it's like, no, no, no,\n\n01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:13.900\nit's okay to just think something that's maybe not great, you know?\n\n01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:14.900\nYou don't have to accept things,\n\n01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:16.900\nyou don't have to like things to accept them.\n\n01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:17.900\nYeah.\n\n01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:19.900\nAnd there's a thing I've read in some of these books,\n\n01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:20.900\nwhether it's like, what's his name,\n\n01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:22.900\nI can't even fucking sell like men or something like that.\n\n01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:23.900\nHe was like this guy,\n\n01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:25.900\nit's like this sort of, this happiness thing.\n\n01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:30.900\nIt's a nuanced, this idea of, we'll get,\n\n01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:35.900\nif you're worried about going to Thanksgiving\n\n01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:40.900\nbecause you hate, you're uncomfortable talking to your uncle.\n\n01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:41.900\nI know I'm going to,\n\n01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:44.900\nthis is going to be an awful metaphor that doesn't land the point,\n\n01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:45.900\nbut here I go.\n\n01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.900\nBut I'm like, you're on your way to this,\n\n01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:52.900\nyou're invited to a party that makes you nervous for some reason,\n\n01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:54.900\nlet's say, you're uncomfortable.\n\n01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:59.900\nWe think that the day that you realize\n\n01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:03.900\nyou don't want to go to the party because your uncle's racist,\n\n01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:10.900\nor that, even though that thought doesn't make you happy,\n\n01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:15.900\nwe believe, we don't think that you're following your comfort\n\n01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:19.900\nbecause what's comfortable about the thought that your uncle's racist, right?\n\n01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:24.900\nOr that you're a fuck-up that'll just get lost on the way to the party.\n\n01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:31.900\nWe say negative shit to ourselves that actually causes a dopamine spike\n\n01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:37.900\nand causes us to, it gives us a little fire escape out of a zone of discomfort.\n\n01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:41.900\nPretending that we understand something for the sake of not thinking about it.\n\n01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:43.900\nExactly, yeah.\n\n01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:46.900\nNo one likes to be uncertain,\n\n01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:51.900\nand yet, actually, uncertainty is a huge invitation\n\n01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:55.900\nto a really beneficial burning man\n\n01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:59.900\nwhere weird ideas can happen while you have no idea what the fuck you think.\n\n01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:02.900\nBut it feels like pain to us, it actually feels criminal to us,\n\n01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:05.900\nand then you go, you know what, fuck that guy, I'm not going to his party,\n\n01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:09.900\nand even though it creates this negative thing in your life,\n\n01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:14.900\nyou're happy, you made yourself happy.\n\n01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:16.900\nI thought I saw a hand or something out there,\n\n01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:19.900\nbut it's probably just people going, Jesus Christ, how long is this show?\n\n01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:22.900\nIt's probably just four people looking at their watches in unison.\n\n01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:25.900\nI'm having a great time.\n\n01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:28.900\nThis is a dream come true.\n\n01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:30.900\nWe should be fair.\n\n01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:33.900\nAsa was out front handing out his flyers for Asanomics.\n\n01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:35.900\nIt's a new religion.\n\n01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:37.900\nEverybody gets $5 and that's it.\n\n01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:39.900\nHis name's not even Asa.\n\n01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:44.900\nIt stands for assertiveness, spirit, and more assertiveness.\n\n01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:48.900\nOr angle, side angle, any of those acronyms.\n\n01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:52.900\nI was just going to say what you were saying about honesty and everything.\n\n01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:55.900\nLike I said when I was a kid, I could never not be myself,\n\n01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:59.900\nbut I think now I've felt pressure to maybe kind of change\n\n01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.900\nor to pull these certain thoughts,\n\n01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:05.900\nand I think maybe that's kind of making me really sick inside.\n\n01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:09.900\nLike lately, and I've always been just a really fully authentic person\n\n01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:11.900\nregardless of what happens.\n\n01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:14.900\nWhat happens will happen, you know,\n\n01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:16.900\nand otherwise you'll just make yourself sick.\n\n01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:19.900\nYeah, I mean, this is going to sound cornball,\n\n01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:21.900\nlike I'm like Geraldo and I'm like capitalizing,\n\n01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:23.900\nI don't want to get points for it,\n\n01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:25.900\nI'm like I can't protect you from anybody.\n\n01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:28.900\nI can't protect myself from myself or anybody else,\n\n01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:30.900\nbut I will, I can guarantee you this,\n\n01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:33.900\nand maybe what's important is that we all guarantee this to each other.\n\n01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:36.900\nAny chance we get is that you can't say anything to me\n\n01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:42.900\nthat's going to make me suddenly start to realize you're a bad person.\n\n01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:44.900\nExcept lies.\n\n01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:47.900\nLike if I find out that you said one thing\n\n01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:50.900\nand then I find out you're capable of dishonesty,\n\n01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:53.900\nbecause that makes you dangerous because,\n\n01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:56.900\nbut I can forgive you if you then later tell me,\n\n01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:59.900\nI lied to you about this and that,\n\n01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:03.900\nbut if you tell me the truth,\n\n01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:06.900\nI am never going to punish you for it.\n\n01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:08.900\nI'm never going to like,\n\n01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:11.900\nunless it's an accident, unless you go like,\n\n01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.900\ncan I tell you something?\n\n01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:15.900\nI put peanut butter on my pussy the other day,\n\n01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:17.900\nand I might accidentally go,\n\n01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:20.900\nthat's fucking nuts, and you burst into tears and go,\n\n01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:23.900\nthe word nuts is what they said to me when I'm like,\n\n01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:25.900\nthat shit could happen.\n\n01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:27.900\nI could step on your foot while we're dancing,\n\n01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:31.900\nbut I am never, I'm never going to go,\n\n01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:34.900\nwell, you shouldn't be danced with,\n\n01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:36.900\nyou don't belong on this dance floor,\n\n01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:38.900\nyou should, you know, and so,\n\n01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:41.900\nlike if nowhere else other than your therapist's office,\n\n01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:44.900\nyou know, please consider this an actual definition,\n\n01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:47.900\nnot a political definition of a safe place.\n\n01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:49.900\nIt's not, nowhere is safe,\n\n01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:54.900\nbut you're safe from us up here for sure.\n\n01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:56.900\nAcross the threshold,\n\n01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:59.900\nblurt semi-fictional shit\n\n01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:01.900\nthat you haven't even explored yet.\n\n01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:05.900\nIf you want to, you run the risk of people in the reddit going,\n\n01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:11.900\nbut not us, we will hold you on our shoulders\n\n01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:15.900\nbecause, what can we accomplish with this podcast\n\n01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:19.900\nif not corrupting a new generation?\n\n01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:21.900\nCelebrating honesty.\n\n01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:23.900\nAnd I guess that invitation goes for you too, Asa,\n\n01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:25.900\nbut I don't know if I trust you yet.\n\n01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:27.900\nWhat can I do to earn your trust?\n\n01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:29.900\nWell, I have a suspender thing,\n\n01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.900\nbecause I'm like, what's wrong with a belt?\n\n01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:33.900\nNo suspenders are more convenient.\n\n01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:35.900\nI'm an advocate.\n\n01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:37.900\nThank you, I appreciate that.\n\n01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:40.900\nNo, I'm kidding, it's probably a bad joke.\n\n01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.900\nBecause my whole point is we have to trust each other.\n\n01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:44.900\nI trust you.\n\n01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:46.900\nCaroline?\n\n01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:47.900\nYeah.\n\n01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:49.900\nHappy birthday.\n\n01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:50.900\nThanks.\n\n01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:52.900\nUnless it turns out to not really be your birthday, I trust you.\n\n01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:53.900\nOh, it's my birthday.\n\n01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:55.900\nIt was yesterday.\n\n01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:57.900\nYeah, it was yesterday.\n\n01:51:57.900 --> 01:51:58.900\nSo it's not really your birthday?\n\n01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:00.900\nIt's not, but I wanted to get on stage.\n\n01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:03.900\nThis trust thing is getting off to a shit start.\n\n01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:05.900\nBut she told us it was yesterday.\n\n01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:07.900\nShe wasn't like, no, yeah, it's my birthday.\n\n01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:09.900\nYou know what we should do in the show?\n\n01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:12.900\nI think because I think, you know,\n\n01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:14.900\nlike sometimes this makes us uncomfortable\n\n01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:16.900\nbecause the show attracts a certain mind\n\n01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:20.900\nthat's going to be averse to things that feel like a revival tent\n\n01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:24.900\nbecause that evokes thoughts of religion and dishonesty.\n\n01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:27.900\nBut it's a town meeting, this podcast,\n\n01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:31.900\nand we should have a moment in the show where we go,\n\n01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:33.900\nlike we used to.\n\n01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:35.900\nHey, anybody got something so pressing\n\n01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:37.900\nthat they really want to talk about it?\n\n01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:40.900\nWhat's, you know, come up and talk,\n\n01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:42.900\nand we'll get to know people.\n\n01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:44.900\nBecause we used to do that, and then we,\n\n01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:46.900\nI don't know why we stopped.\n\n01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:48.900\nWho's having great pain, who's having a great day,\n\n01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:49.900\nbut then sometimes you'd be like,\n\n01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:52.900\njust anybody who really, really has something to say or something.\n\n01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:54.900\nYeah, I think I maybe started to feel like,\n\n01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:56.900\nwell, we're not, it's not, it's like,\n\n01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:59.900\noh, are we forming a whack pack like Howard Stern?\n\n01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:04.900\nIs it just becoming like a spectacle of some kind?\n\n01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:06.900\nBut that was never the audience's fault.\n\n01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:08.900\nI think that was...\n\n01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:10.900\nI think you just found a lot of the wrong people sometimes\n\n01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:12.900\nwhen you were on tour.\n\n01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:14.900\nI just really recently re-listened to a bunch of stuff,\n\n01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:17.900\nso I'm kind of like remembering a lot of those moments now,\n\n01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:20.900\nand being like, yeah, I think you just got a couple of bad eggs\n\n01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:22.900\nalong the way, and it kind of...\n\n01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:24.900\nI think in Los Angeles, out of Monday night, downtown,\n\n01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:26.900\nwe can probably trust that, yeah.\n\n01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.900\nWell, it also got to a point where like,\n\n01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:32.900\nwe cut more fish than boots by casting that net,\n\n01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:35.900\nbut like, it got to the point where the front couple of rows\n\n01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:37.900\nwere people like boxing each other to try to be up there,\n\n01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:40.900\nto kind of be like, in the show.\n\n01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:42.900\nI think people were expecting to be the next Spencer\n\n01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:44.900\nor Adam Goldberg or whoever,\n\n01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:48.900\nand it was getting a little frisky for my money.\n\n01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:49.900\nThat's the dream.\n\n01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:51.900\nThat's the dream for like, almost,\n\n01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.900\nI think a lot of people that listen to the podcast, everyone.\n\n01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:55.900\nBad dreams of being Spencer, you know.\n\n01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.900\nDo better.\n\n01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:00.900\nCome on.\n\n01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:02.900\nSpencer, for those people having that dream,\n\n01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:05.900\ntell them one thing you did this week for me,\n\n01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:07.900\nthat de-glamorizes.\n\n01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:08.900\nI dream about having a yacht.\n\n01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:09.900\nWhat?\n\n01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:10.900\nI dream about having a yacht.\n\n01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:12.900\nLike, you could think bigger than being on a fucking podcast.\n\n01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:16.900\nNo, but I'm saying tell the people dreaming of being the next Spencer\n\n01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:20.900\none thing that you did this week for me\n\n01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:23.900\nthat will disabuse them of their fantasies.\n\n01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:25.900\nOh, um...\n\n01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:26.900\nHmm.\n\n01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:28.900\nThis week?\n\n01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:30.900\nWell, or recently, just a minute.\n\n01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:32.900\nSorry.\n\n01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:34.900\nI like my job.\n\n01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:35.900\nAll right.\n\n01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:36.900\nOkay, sorry.\n\n01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:38.900\nI just thought you'd have a fun...\n\n01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:41.900\nI mean, you have to do so much specific, like, tedious shit.\n\n01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:43.900\nI really like most of that stuff.\n\n01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:44.900\nIt's fun.\n\n01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:46.900\nI feel activated and good.\n\n01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:48.900\nYeah, I like that stuff too, just like...\n\n01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:49.900\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:50.900\nSpencer's healthy now.\n\n01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:55.900\nHe had to oversee the hard installation of Tesla software\n\n01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:59.900\nonto my car that wasn't coming through Wi-Fi fast enough for me.\n\n01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:00.900\nYeah.\n\n01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:02.900\nSpencer, are you self-actualized now?\n\n01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:03.900\nNo, no.\n\n01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:04.900\nOkay.\n\n01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:05.900\nI just...\n\n01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:08.900\nI follow your Instagram, so I know you've been going through this whole fitness thing\n\n01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:11.900\nand it's like, wow, he might be reaching actualization.\n\n01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:15.900\nI've always been healthier than most, even at my unhealthiest.\n\n01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:16.900\nNice.\n\n01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:18.900\nAnd not arrogant at all.\n\n01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:19.900\nThat's not arrogant.\n\n01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:20.900\nYou...\n\n01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:22.900\nI'm not gonna say show it, because I don't want...\n\n01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:24.900\nIt doesn't show up.\n\n01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:25.900\nI got like...\n\n01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:26.900\nHe sent a text saying that...\n\n01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:30.900\nI'm uncomfortable telling friends I think I have a six pack.\n\n01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:31.900\nOoh.\n\n01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:32.900\nIt's not...\n\n01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:33.900\nI can't...\n\n01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:34.900\nIt doesn't show up on film.\n\n01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:35.900\nYeah, show it.\n\n01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:39.900\nIt doesn't show up on film, and it doesn't show up except under the right lighting.\n\n01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:46.900\nAnd when those things are no longer true and it actually shows up, then I will show it.\n\n01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:50.900\nAnd it'll be soon, because the progress I've been making is encouraging.\n\n01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:52.900\nCliff Hanger!\n\n01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:55.900\nThank you, gang.\n\n01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:56.900\nThanks, guys.\n\n01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:57.900\nThanks, Caroline.\n\n01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:58.900\nThank you, Asa.\n\n01:55:58.900 --> 01:55:59.900\nThank you, Nova.\n\n01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:00.900\nCheers.\n\n01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:06.900\nAlso, there's always Zach, Chris, Jer, Nolan, everybody here.\n\n01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:07.900\nHow many times...\n\n01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:11.900\nSpencer, your game master, everybody.\n\n01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:13.900\nCome to HarmonQuest.\n\n01:56:13.900 -->

01:56:20.900\nThank you all.\n\n01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:24.900\nDrive fast, take chances, and if that doesn't work, tie him up with a rope and put him in a bush.\n\n01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:25.900\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:50.900\nIt's a good show!\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[162391]}
