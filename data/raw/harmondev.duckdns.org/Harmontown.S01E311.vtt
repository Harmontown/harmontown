WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.760
Thank you all for coming from MacArthur Park,

00:10.760 --> 00:14.440
Los Angeles, somewhere near downtown LA.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.600
On a Monday night, Harmontown is now in session.

00:17.600 --> 00:27.020
Let's bring out the Game Master Spencer,

00:27.020 --> 00:38.800
Crittenden, and your Mayor, Dan Harmon.

00:38.800 --> 00:49.800
Oh no, coming in hot.

00:49.800 --> 00:55.400
What the hell is going on?

00:55.400 --> 00:56.660
Nothing.

00:56.660 --> 01:00.180
Is this my natural posture?

01:00.180 --> 01:01.580
I'm not sucking anything in.

01:07.140 --> 01:10.140
I just felt like I had a little bit of a cheeseburger

01:10.140 --> 01:11.100
slide in New York.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.700
Oh, sorry.

01:12.700 --> 01:13.660
Hip hop.

01:13.660 --> 01:17.140
Oh, you've got to stop eating like a piece of shit

01:17.140 --> 01:18.620
if you want to be beaten.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.220
You're weight into submission.

01:21.220 --> 01:24.900
I fucked your mama with my nocturnal emissions.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.780
Autopilot, they call it.

01:26.780 --> 01:31.460
I fucked her without even trying.

01:31.460 --> 01:35.460
I'm bored with your mama sexually.

01:35.460 --> 01:37.180
Oh, damn.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.340
Wow.

01:38.340 --> 01:46.980
It took over 300 episodes, because finally tire of that.

01:46.980 --> 01:48.980
Honeymoon's over.

01:48.980 --> 01:51.940
You and their mama had a pretty good run, I got to say.

01:51.940 --> 01:54.660
It was the longest relationship with anything.

01:54.660 --> 01:58.500
Or any job or automobile, like I've never

01:58.500 --> 02:03.500
committed to anything longer than I have your mama.

02:03.500 --> 02:07.180
I wonder how many times you affect the mama's

02:07.180 --> 02:08.540
to the north and to the south.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.060
I don't know, three or four.

02:13.060 --> 02:15.100
It seems like the kind of thing, and I wouldn't want

02:15.100 --> 02:16.620
to cause busy work for this person,

02:16.620 --> 02:20.980
but I don't want to trigger any kind of disorder that

02:20.980 --> 02:24.020
needs to not be triggered for someone to be happy.

02:24.020 --> 02:26.900
But it seems like the kind of thing

02:26.900 --> 02:29.300
that someone on the internet would just go through,

02:29.300 --> 02:31.860
and they would give us an accurate count on how many times

02:31.860 --> 02:35.100
the phrase, fuck your mama, has been said.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.180
What do you think it would be?

02:36.180 --> 02:37.980
Take a jelly bean jar count.

02:37.980 --> 02:39.620
Just saying, I fucked your mama?

02:39.620 --> 02:40.020
Yeah, yeah.

02:40.020 --> 02:42.220
Oh, god.

02:42.220 --> 02:46.100
I would say 1,700 times.

02:49.860 --> 02:51.300
It might be more than that.

02:51.300 --> 02:55.300
That might be like a Price's Right, Bitter's Row, low ball.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.900
You're going to say 1,701 and fucking win and get up there.

02:58.900 --> 02:59.940
We won't go Price's, right?

02:59.940 --> 03:02.620
We'll go distance from absolute.

03:02.620 --> 03:03.820
I'm guessing 1,700.

03:03.820 --> 03:05.340
I'm going to say 1,500.

03:05.340 --> 03:07.380
Does anybody here have the aptitude for that sort of thing

03:07.380 --> 03:10.180
that they think they know?

03:10.180 --> 03:11.460
The aptitude for guessing?

03:11.460 --> 03:12.540
No, no, no.

03:12.540 --> 03:16.300
Somebody, autism, autism.

03:16.300 --> 03:20.340
Does anyone here have autism?

03:20.340 --> 03:21.660
I mean, does anybody have to think

03:21.660 --> 03:24.300
that they would think much higher and much lower numbers?

03:24.300 --> 03:27.460
It's got to be less than 300.

03:27.460 --> 03:28.820
It's got to be less than 300?

03:28.820 --> 03:29.460
Yeah.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.380
You really think an episode's gone by without?

03:31.380 --> 03:35.420
So let's say if you've wrapped half the episodes

03:35.420 --> 03:39.660
and in three-quarter of those you've mentioned it at all,

03:39.660 --> 03:40.540
then that's what?

03:40.540 --> 03:42.660
Like 40% of the episodes.

03:42.660 --> 03:45.500
So you would have to fuck them to the north and to the south

03:45.500 --> 03:47.380
three times per rap.

03:47.380 --> 03:48.060
No, Dan is saying just.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.740
No, no, we're talking about just fucking your mama's

03:49.740 --> 03:50.660
in one rap.

03:50.660 --> 03:53.020
OK, so I thought this was about fucking them both

03:53.020 --> 03:55.020
in the north and the south.

03:55.020 --> 03:56.740
Look, I want all these numbers.

03:56.740 --> 03:57.980
Easily 2,000.

03:57.980 --> 04:01.580
I want to get all these numbers.

04:01.580 --> 04:02.060
Huh?

04:02.060 --> 04:04.580
No, no, this is different.

04:04.580 --> 04:05.660
No, but Dan.

04:05.660 --> 04:08.980
That's why I didn't want to pollute this with the.

04:08.980 --> 04:10.420
But these are the right questions.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.780
I just wanted to start with a baseline of how many.

04:12.780 --> 04:15.740
Because yeah, because you'll fuck like seven mamas in one

04:15.740 --> 04:17.740
rap, then 300.

04:17.740 --> 04:20.460
If I rap for two minutes, that's going to like be.

04:20.460 --> 04:21.540
So at least 20.

04:21.540 --> 04:25.460
My guess is an average of five times per the number

04:25.460 --> 04:27.100
of episodes, just because some episodes.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.580
Sure, maybe I don't rap at all.

04:28.580 --> 04:29.260
That's fair.

04:29.260 --> 04:32.380
And then, but then it's like, it is my crutch.

04:32.380 --> 04:35.740
The only time I've done away with it would be the Mike Eagle

04:35.740 --> 04:36.180
episode.

04:36.180 --> 04:38.260
And I probably did it 17 times.

04:38.260 --> 04:39.700
Otherwise, yeah.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.980
So I'm going to say, actually, you know what?

04:41.980 --> 04:43.340
I think 1,500 is way too low.

04:43.340 --> 04:44.140
I think you're right.

04:44.140 --> 04:45.140
I'm going 1,700.

04:45.140 --> 04:46.620
I'm going to go 1,900.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.340
OK.

04:47.340 --> 04:48.340
I want to go, OK.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.300
So who knows who can count that?

04:50.300 --> 04:51.260
Maybe somebody can.

04:51.260 --> 04:56.380
These days, the last time I checked, they had Avid plug-ins.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.700
This was still when I was working at community.

04:58.700 --> 05:06.260
I think Yahoo season, like Avid had this plug-in that,

05:06.260 --> 05:10.540
I can't remember what it was called, but you can type in

05:10.540 --> 05:12.620
a word like butterfly.

05:12.620 --> 05:15.780
And it would go through all of the footage in the bins

05:15.780 --> 05:19.100
and bring up clips marked.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.380
And it would be like Donald Glover saying butterfly.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.620
Chevy Chase saying butterfly.

05:22.620 --> 05:26.700
Like, you type in the word, and it would voice recognize

05:26.700 --> 05:28.340
without having to do it in real time.

05:28.340 --> 05:31.780
It would just go scrub through all of the data instantly

05:31.780 --> 05:38.260
and bring up a list sorted by relevance or whatever.

05:38.260 --> 05:41.060
And at the top of the list, it was just like, holy shit.

05:41.060 --> 05:43.140
This is everyone saying butterfly.

05:43.140 --> 05:46.180
And then there would be like a steep drop down to people

05:46.180 --> 05:51.540
saying, give me a piece of peanut butter pie or something.

05:51.540 --> 05:54.980
But it was amazing, which is also useful if you were going

05:54.980 --> 05:58.060
to edit a fucking mix or something.

05:58.060 --> 06:01.860
And now you'd have a thing that rhymes with butterfly.

06:01.860 --> 06:02.940
Peanut butter pie.

06:02.940 --> 06:05.820
I thought that was just incredible.

06:05.820 --> 06:09.180
Editing is, obviously, we don't wear little white gloves

06:09.180 --> 06:11.820
and splice tape anymore.

06:11.820 --> 06:14.220
But beyond that leap to the digital,

06:14.220 --> 06:17.860
there really hasn't been so few things that actually make it

06:17.860 --> 06:19.900
a faster thing to edit, which has always

06:19.900 --> 06:25.740
been this sort of Promethean hybrid of engineering

06:25.740 --> 06:28.500
and artistry editing.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.500
And the idea that an AI could just

06:31.500 --> 06:35.820
be like, pull up all those takes where they got their line

06:35.820 --> 06:41.860
right or whatever, which used to be the domain of man.

06:41.860 --> 06:46.060
And that is an intentionally exclusive statement.

06:46.060 --> 06:47.460
Only male editors can.

06:50.740 --> 07:00.460
Speaking of progress, Stanley has progressed off

07:00.460 --> 07:04.020
of the mortal realm, his mission accomplished.

07:04.020 --> 07:06.020
Was he 94 years old?

07:06.020 --> 07:07.020
95.

07:07.020 --> 07:07.820
What a life.

07:07.820 --> 07:09.260
Did you meet him?

07:09.260 --> 07:13.860
I met him, but it was like I met him in a line.

07:13.860 --> 07:15.100
Right, a lot of Comic-Con or something?

07:15.100 --> 07:16.180
Yeah.

07:16.180 --> 07:16.900
You weren't there for that?

07:16.900 --> 07:17.260
No.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.780
OK, yeah, that was a Rick and Morty thing.

07:18.780 --> 07:23.820
Me and Justin, we went to Kamikaze, Stanley's Kamikaze,

07:23.820 --> 07:27.060
and he signed a thing.

07:27.060 --> 07:31.980
And it wasn't really like come party with Stanley.

07:31.980 --> 07:36.340
But were you a fan of the DC stuff?

07:40.340 --> 07:45.420
I don't really care about that stuff at all, anyway, anymore.

07:45.420 --> 07:47.380
I'm tired.

07:47.380 --> 07:55.140
But it's objectively notable that Stanley was obviously,

07:55.140 --> 07:56.220
I mean, wow, what a life.

07:56.220 --> 08:01.540
It's just interesting to, not only

08:01.540 --> 08:04.700
was he like, oh, we have him to thank for a bunch of shit

08:04.700 --> 08:09.940
that we've been talking about for the last 25 years alone.

08:09.940 --> 08:12.820
But the idea of living a life so complete

08:12.820 --> 08:16.940
that in your way past your 80th year, which,

08:16.940 --> 08:19.060
if I make it past 80, I'm going to be like,

08:19.060 --> 08:21.820
I just imagine myself, all I'll be doing

08:21.820 --> 08:26.940
is it will be all pharmaceutical-based and paperwork

08:26.940 --> 08:30.260
and getting sued or whatever you do past 80.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.540
You know, they're just fighting for the right

08:32.540 --> 08:38.260
to just sort of squat on Tara firmer.

08:38.260 --> 08:43.620
But in his fight, I mean, he got to watch the thing

08:43.620 --> 08:45.140
that in your biopic usually just has

08:45.140 --> 08:50.020
to happen in that one paragraph after the person

08:50.020 --> 08:51.820
that the biopic's about dies.

08:51.820 --> 08:54.100
Charlie Chaplin goes away and then the paragraph says,

08:54.100 --> 08:57.940
and now today he's taught in universities and blah, blah,

08:57.940 --> 09:00.460
blah, blah, blah, blah.

09:00.460 --> 09:03.380
And you always have that feeling of, oh, that's a little sad.

09:03.380 --> 09:06.740
I wish Picasso or so and so could have been there

09:06.740 --> 09:08.040
for that part.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.060
It was kind of neat.

09:10.060 --> 09:16.940
He got to, pretty sure he left after the credits of his biopic.

09:16.940 --> 09:17.820
He's probably like, you know what,

09:17.820 --> 09:20.460
if I stick around for 10 more minutes,

09:20.460 --> 09:23.820
something awful is going to happen.

09:23.820 --> 09:25.940
He really nailed it.

09:25.940 --> 09:32.940
There was right at the end there, wasn't there a weird fracas, something about him suing

09:32.940 --> 09:41.460
his manager, or there was some kind of, I don't know, I hope it was a legitimate.

09:41.460 --> 09:44.860
Wait, so he was suing his nurse and then he just conveniently dies?

09:44.860 --> 09:45.860
Uh-oh.

09:45.860 --> 09:47.660
I don't even, I mean.

09:47.660 --> 09:52.300
Reported here first, Harmontown Exclusive Scoop.

09:52.300 --> 09:57.380
I heard that he didn't really get to do any of the comics or Fantastic Four or any of

09:57.380 --> 10:00.980
the comics he got known to for until he was 40 years old.

10:00.980 --> 10:07.260
So it's not just like, oh, he was an intrepid young, he was a 40 year old man and then his

10:07.260 --> 10:08.260
life started.

10:08.260 --> 10:13.500
Yeah, that's good, I'm glad you pointed that out, because it's like, what can we learn

10:13.500 --> 10:18.980
from people, because otherwise the message becomes as bland as like, oh, I hope I get

10:18.980 --> 10:22.220
to do stuff, that must have been nice for him.

10:22.220 --> 10:29.860
But yeah, I, you know, a lot of people email me or hopefully a lot of people don't have

10:29.860 --> 10:35.700
my email, but, you know, Tumblr messages and whatever, people that slide into my DMs or

10:35.700 --> 10:46.060
what, people, there's a theme among the things that people ask me called, am I too old to

10:46.060 --> 10:48.420
try to start doing what you're doing?

10:48.420 --> 10:56.100
If I've been up until now a plumber or an exterminator or a bicycle thief.

10:56.100 --> 11:01.500
And of course we know that fashionably you're supposed to say, absolutely not, you're never

11:01.500 --> 11:02.500
too old.

11:02.500 --> 11:09.900
But I actually believe that, you know, you have to start when you're 20, no, I'm kidding.

11:09.900 --> 11:15.660
No, I mean, I truly believe it's so important to keep that in mind and such a great example

11:15.660 --> 11:21.820
because he was basically, it's like, hey, guess what, the TV writing business got sued

11:21.820 --> 11:24.580
for it and I don't know if they even cleaned up their act, there's ageism.

11:24.580 --> 11:29.540
Like in existing industries, these existing channels, let the kids ask, how do I do it,

11:29.540 --> 11:31.420
how did they do it yesterday?

11:31.420 --> 11:36.660
But the blessing and curse of maybe feeling like you're too long in the tooth to strike

11:36.660 --> 11:41.420
out and do something is that you almost got no choice but to, you know, carve out your

11:41.420 --> 11:42.420
own niche.

11:42.420 --> 11:46.580
Like, but absolutely, I mean, it's like, he's not known for that.

11:46.580 --> 11:52.740
It's not like, it's not like his eulogy on ABC News today is going to be known as the

11:52.740 --> 11:56.060
late starter Stanley Brano.

11:56.060 --> 12:00.940
But yeah, I mean, it's probably was a huge factor in his life that he had to think about

12:00.940 --> 12:05.980
all the time from 32 to 40, you know, like, what the fuck am I doing?

12:05.980 --> 12:11.820
How many times do you think he maybe thought, why am I drawing sequential pictures of a guy

12:11.820 --> 12:12.820
claiming a wall?

12:12.820 --> 12:15.100
This is never, I got to stop this.

12:15.100 --> 12:20.500
This is not going to go anywhere other than the wall.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.500
Do we have Schrabs?

12:21.500 --> 12:22.500
I don't know.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.500
It's his birthday.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.500
It's his birthday.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.500
Why would he come here?

12:25.500 --> 12:26.500
Happy birthday, Schrab.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.500
Happy birthday, Schrab.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.500
Oh, yeah.

12:28.500 --> 12:32.100
He's still not here, though.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.100
Yeah, I know.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.260
I love, I love the Rob shop.

12:34.260 --> 12:35.500
I'm glad he's not here on his birthday.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.380
That would be incredibly depressing.

12:37.380 --> 12:38.580
You also invited him.

12:38.580 --> 12:39.580
I did.

12:39.580 --> 12:40.580
But I was, I'm glad.

12:40.580 --> 12:41.580
Not that glad.

12:41.580 --> 12:42.580
I'm not heave that call.

12:42.580 --> 12:43.580
Well, I'm glad he's not here either.

12:43.580 --> 12:44.580
Well, I'm glad he's not here either.

12:44.580 --> 12:50.060
On the chance that the truth would be more depressing, like, he's happy to find out that

12:50.060 --> 12:51.700
he had something better to do.

12:51.700 --> 12:52.700
Yeah.

12:52.700 --> 12:59.860
What do they say, pray for, pray for sunshine, prepare for rain?

12:59.860 --> 13:00.860
Something like that.

13:00.860 --> 13:01.860
I don't know.

13:01.860 --> 13:02.860
I think I coined it.

13:02.860 --> 13:06.460
How was your New York experience?

13:06.460 --> 13:10.580
I know, there's a story that happened in New York that is going to drop on the next episode

13:10.580 --> 13:11.580
after this one.

13:11.580 --> 13:12.580
Oh, really?

13:12.580 --> 13:13.580
Yeah.

13:13.580 --> 13:17.660
It's going to come out like during the week we're off around Thanksgiving.

13:17.660 --> 13:20.780
Things went a little hairy on the way to New York City.

13:20.780 --> 13:22.820
And not what they're recording.

13:22.820 --> 13:23.820
Yeah.

13:23.820 --> 13:24.820
Like, they're recording.

13:24.820 --> 13:29.580
I talked about, we talked about nothing but, because I said in New York, I said, look,

13:29.580 --> 13:34.580
we're either going to, if we talk, if we start talking about our trip to New York, that'll

13:34.580 --> 13:36.540
be the entire 90 minute show.

13:36.540 --> 13:39.300
Let's just say, I became Joey Ramone.

13:39.300 --> 13:44.780
And Cody became Sid and Nancy.

13:44.780 --> 13:50.940
Joey Ramone was famously known for falling asleep outside.

13:50.940 --> 13:54.020
We were over-served, is the headline.

13:54.020 --> 13:55.020
You got to check out the episode.

13:55.020 --> 13:56.020
It'll be a really good one.

13:56.020 --> 13:57.020
We know you guys are famous for listening to the podcast.

13:57.020 --> 13:58.020
I'm still so ashamed of myself.

13:58.020 --> 13:59.020
It's the worst.

13:59.020 --> 14:00.020
Yeah.

14:00.020 --> 14:08.860
But, and I think I was real drunk when I said it, but I babbled a little bit at the end,

14:08.860 --> 14:14.100
because I didn't want it to just be a maypole dance around people getting drunk and having

14:14.100 --> 14:16.020
embarrassing things happen to them.

14:16.020 --> 14:23.980
I want, I don't want to repeat myself for that episode, but this is going to be a recurring

14:23.980 --> 14:29.340
theme now after going through a year of sorting through a bunch of shit.

14:29.340 --> 14:35.300
My new thing is, got to be vulnerable, got to be honest, got to be transparent, got to

14:35.300 --> 14:42.260
just, even though there is this increasing pressure from a reaction chamber, this world

14:42.260 --> 14:48.140
that we're voluntarily or not transitioning into, we're becoming these digital creatures

14:48.140 --> 14:51.140
and we can't have that digital world be a place of shame.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.860
That can't rule the day.

14:52.860 --> 14:56.620
Did you guys see this, the Trumpy Bear ad thing?

14:56.620 --> 14:57.620
Yeah.

14:57.620 --> 14:58.620
Trumpy Bear.

14:58.620 --> 15:06.500
Do you know what, so no then, there was this ad aired on Fox News for Trumpy Bear, seemed

15:06.500 --> 15:11.580
like it was a joke, it was like it could have been an onion produced commercial for Trumpy

15:11.580 --> 15:12.580
Bear.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.980
It had the unmistakable tone, a little bit of a sketch.

15:14.980 --> 15:20.140
Even the act, like even the on-screen actors that were like using it just seemed like they

15:20.140 --> 15:25.100
were doing it as a joke, it has a flat blanket inside of it.

15:25.100 --> 15:31.820
So you open it, and you can pull out an American flag blanket out of its tummy and curl up

15:31.820 --> 15:33.220
with Trumpy Bear.

15:33.220 --> 15:34.700
And it comes with a certificate.

15:34.700 --> 15:39.140
And there's a dude on a motorcycle, like a big Harley's Angel, Harley's Angel, what

15:39.140 --> 15:40.140
the fuck is that?

15:40.140 --> 15:44.540
A house angel, Harley guy, driving around with a teddy bear talking about, yeah, I've

15:44.540 --> 15:45.820
got my Trumpy Bear.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.580
Trumpy Bear's my bro or something.

15:48.580 --> 15:51.420
It seems like a joke, have we verified that it's for real?

15:51.420 --> 15:54.260
No, we've just mused idly about it.

15:54.260 --> 15:59.220
The reason I bring it up is because I looked at it and I was like, my sincere optimistic

15:59.220 --> 16:08.580
hope here is that this is Nathan Fielder or John Oliver that we're gonna find out a couple

16:08.580 --> 16:10.580
months from now.

16:10.580 --> 16:19.660
Or someone doing that, because if it is, that's ingenious because, and then that kind of made

16:19.660 --> 16:23.540
me realize how much we need that, whether this is that or not.

16:23.540 --> 16:28.620
Like that has been my continued frustration that to the extent that you view our country

16:28.620 --> 16:33.700
as being in any kind of like battle between two sides, it's your choice if you don't want

16:33.700 --> 16:34.700
to see it that way.

16:34.700 --> 16:35.700
I understand that.

16:35.700 --> 16:40.700
You're a Harmontown audience and I've been that guy for more longer than I've been this

16:40.700 --> 16:44.900
pick-as-side guy, wouldn't force anything on you.

16:44.900 --> 16:52.860
But if you do perceive this kind of like two-sided thing, the next thing you might perceive to

16:52.860 --> 17:00.660
your frustration is that when did we, if we are the left, when did we become the ones

17:00.660 --> 17:05.020
that aren't funny?

17:05.020 --> 17:08.500
Because that's how we started for sure.

17:08.500 --> 17:17.620
There's nothing funny or smart about the views that are held by that other side.

17:17.620 --> 17:22.060
Therefore what a crime it is that they're the trolls, that they're the ones doing the

17:22.060 --> 17:29.220
bits and the practical jokes and the stunts and it's like we got to get that scepter

17:29.220 --> 17:36.660
back where we should be having orgies in the street and making jokes that they don't understand

17:36.660 --> 17:43.180
and high-fiving each other for being misunderstood and ununderstandable and we should be able

17:43.180 --> 17:48.540
to stand side by side with people that we don't even get but we know that we want them

17:48.540 --> 17:54.820
to have a right to not be gotten and to the point where the only way to be on that other

17:54.820 --> 18:01.660
side is to be either silent and ashamed or loud and embarrassing to those other people

18:01.660 --> 18:08.540
that are silent and that's where you want your foes, otherwise you're just awash in

18:08.540 --> 18:16.100
this thing that then our beautiful, you know, kind of somewhere caught in the middle people,

18:16.100 --> 18:19.780
they get that luxury of going like, I don't see any difference between you guys and that's

18:19.780 --> 18:25.900
when we lose big time, you lose that big giant middle of people that are like, I'm tired

18:25.900 --> 18:30.140
of this shit, I'm tired of listening to mom and dad bitch at each other, I can't see any

18:30.140 --> 18:31.700
difference between you.

18:31.700 --> 18:36.380
You're both just so ashamed of yourselves and afraid of each other and trying to convince

18:36.380 --> 18:40.940
somebody of something that's not true and you're both lying and you're both politicking

18:40.940 --> 18:46.980
and it's like our great revolutions and our great victories against fascism have always

18:46.980 --> 18:55.300
come down to how can you fight organic freedom, how can you fight sexuality, how can you fight

18:55.300 --> 19:00.340
poetry, how can you fight humor, how can you fight music, there's nothing to get your hands

19:00.340 --> 19:02.140
around, there's no throat there.

19:02.140 --> 19:04.780
But yeah, it's a culture war.

19:04.780 --> 19:09.980
We got those socialist gritty memes now though.

19:09.980 --> 19:14.620
That's like the first positive step we've taken ever.

19:14.620 --> 19:19.020
But I think it would be amazing and relatively hard, it wouldn't be dirty combat to be like,

19:19.020 --> 19:24.620
hey, here's this Trumpy bear and make them all buy a thing, then reveal to them three

19:24.620 --> 19:30.740
months later that all of that money went to black scholarships or abortions or whatever

19:30.740 --> 19:36.820
and then they have to like take it down from the gun rack in their bar and either burn

19:36.820 --> 19:40.420
it, but it's got an American flag in it.

19:40.420 --> 19:44.820
Isn't there like a little caveat on the thing that says...

19:44.820 --> 19:47.460
There's a disclaimer people were pointing out and there's another website or whatever

19:47.460 --> 19:53.780
because it's a real thing, but the question is, is it a real thing that's kind of a cynically

19:53.780 --> 19:57.140
jovial right thing, which wouldn't be the first time.

19:57.140 --> 19:58.140
I mean, they've gotten...

19:58.140 --> 19:59.140
Oh yeah, they've gotten so hard too.

19:59.140 --> 20:00.140
You can tell who's kidding anymore.

20:00.140 --> 20:03.420
They sell mugs and shit.

20:03.420 --> 20:08.140
But it's either that or it does say, there's like this very specific caveat about you can't

20:08.140 --> 20:12.340
return this damaged and it's sort of like, I don't know.

20:12.340 --> 20:23.020
Oh, see, it's got to be a graft, a put-on, a Trojan bear.

20:23.020 --> 20:28.700
If you watch the ad, truly the actors do seem like they're kind of like trying to be like

20:28.700 --> 20:29.700
almost jokey.

20:29.700 --> 20:30.700
I don't know.

20:30.700 --> 20:31.700
It really rides the line.

20:31.700 --> 20:37.260
They're having a good time, but let's say it's real, they're gonna sell a lot of those

20:37.260 --> 20:38.260
Trumpy bears.

20:38.260 --> 20:41.260
Yeah, well, you don't put an ad on the television if you're gonna sell it.

20:41.260 --> 20:42.260
Let's say it's fake.

20:42.260 --> 20:45.460
They'd be stupid to not sell a million Trumpy bears and use that money for it.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.100
No, they're definitely selling something.

20:47.100 --> 20:50.580
You can't just put on a TV, it costs a lot of money, Jeff.

20:50.580 --> 20:51.580
Yeah.

20:51.580 --> 20:55.980
How much does a Trumpy bear go for, Spencer, do you know?

20:55.980 --> 20:57.980
Two payments of $19.95.

20:57.980 --> 20:58.980
Two payments.

20:58.980 --> 20:59.980
Two payments.

20:59.980 --> 21:01.980
Two payments.

21:01.980 --> 21:02.980
Wow.

21:02.980 --> 21:04.980
And like a build a bear as well, like 30 bucks, 20 bucks.

21:04.980 --> 21:05.980
Okay.

21:05.980 --> 21:06.980
I don't know.

21:06.980 --> 21:10.980
Levy pointed out that we haven't yet to talk about Red Dead Redemption 2.

21:10.980 --> 21:12.980
Yeah, no shit, Levy.

21:12.980 --> 21:17.900
It brought to mind this text message exchange that I just had with Cody today.

21:17.900 --> 21:24.380
Now, before I go into this, I really want you to understand that I'm one of the people

21:24.380 --> 21:26.940
who thinks this is a masterpiece of a video game.

21:26.940 --> 21:34.220
So I know how flamed up we get about our video game culture.

21:34.220 --> 21:35.220
That was a good movie.

21:35.220 --> 21:36.220
That was a bad movie.

21:36.220 --> 21:42.140
It looked like a fucking Civil War reenactment compared to Vietnam, like the way that people

21:42.140 --> 21:45.700
are like, you're wrong, it's a bad game.

21:45.700 --> 21:50.940
So I feel like the need to disclaim this and go, I'm a fan of the game because I was just

21:50.940 --> 21:52.820
doing a bit for myself.

21:52.820 --> 21:59.980
Because Cody sent me a tweet, a picture of a tweet from a guy that tweeted, gave up on

21:59.980 --> 22:03.340
Red Dead Redemption 2 because I couldn't figure out which horse was mine.

22:03.340 --> 22:07.620
Fuck this game.

22:07.620 --> 22:12.460
So I texted Cody back, all he has to do is whistle and his horse would walk up to him.

22:12.460 --> 22:13.460
Fuck that guy.

22:13.460 --> 22:17.860
Yeah, I just learned you can like put, you can tie someone up and put them on the back

22:17.860 --> 22:22.260
of their own horse and then, or no, put them on the back of your horse, then get on their

22:22.260 --> 22:26.100
horse and ride their horse and whistle for your horse to follow behind you.

22:26.100 --> 22:29.660
And then you can carry a deer on the back of your horse too.

22:29.660 --> 22:32.900
Everyone wins, except for the person tied up.

22:32.900 --> 22:34.580
Is there a button that says whistle?

22:34.580 --> 22:35.780
Oh yeah, there's a button.

22:35.780 --> 22:36.780
It's the up button.

22:36.780 --> 22:38.260
You know the button that says whistle, don't you?

22:38.260 --> 22:45.980
It's just the button that puts your lips together and the button that blows.

22:45.980 --> 22:49.100
That was a nice, that was a nice to have and have not referenced.

22:49.100 --> 22:57.100
The reference is so old that we get it because if it survived these many sandstorms, we all,

22:57.100 --> 23:00.940
oh no, it's not like, yeah, okay.

23:00.940 --> 23:04.500
How many buttons we got in this thing if there's a whistle button on the controller?

23:04.500 --> 23:07.580
You know, there's a controller, there's like 90 fucking buttons.

23:07.580 --> 23:17.060
So Cody made the mistake of typing, ha, ha, and so now I got a nickel in me and I, well,

23:17.060 --> 23:19.420
what a provocative asshole she is.

23:19.420 --> 23:20.780
No, no, that's not.

23:20.780 --> 23:24.580
So I texted, the reason he should give up is because it takes five attempts to stand

23:24.580 --> 23:28.860
in front of a biscuit the way that lets you pick it up.

23:28.860 --> 23:31.540
And she texted, ha, okay, I go back to sleep.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.540
Come cuddle soon.

23:32.540 --> 23:35.620
Harvey's saving your spot for you, which is her saying, you know, enough.

23:35.620 --> 23:41.780
So I kind of like, I was like, it'd be funny if I kept going.

23:41.780 --> 23:45.140
He should give up because the missions require you to slaughter entire towns, but if you

23:45.140 --> 23:48.620
accidentally press the fart button while you're tipping your hat, your honor goes down and

23:48.620 --> 23:51.700
ammunition costs more.

23:51.700 --> 23:55.260
He should give up because if, if you kill a man that tries to kill you and another man

23:55.260 --> 23:59.380
sees you do it, you have to run and make the third man pinky swear not to share his experience

23:59.380 --> 24:03.700
with his family over dinner, because if you just kill him, the price of bacon goes up.

24:03.700 --> 24:06.540
And if you just ignore him, he instantly tells the world you're a murderer and that

24:06.540 --> 24:11.020
means you have to go to the post office.

24:11.020 --> 24:12.020
It's true.

24:12.020 --> 24:13.020
Yeah.

24:13.020 --> 24:15.380
It doesn't sound like bits.

24:15.380 --> 24:16.380
It's true.

24:16.380 --> 24:17.380
I don't know if you can buy bacon in the game.

24:17.380 --> 24:18.380
That's the only thing that's not true.

24:18.380 --> 24:22.460
I tried to pick up a dead person's hat and I put it on and it was like, this hat will

24:22.460 --> 24:23.620
not be saved.

24:23.620 --> 24:25.020
This is not your default hat.

24:25.020 --> 24:30.660
And I was like, you told me to pick up the hat.

24:30.660 --> 24:34.500
There's almost only one reason he shouldn't give up on Red Dead Redemption two.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.180
And that reason is because you can't find your horse.

24:37.180 --> 24:40.060
You can only find your horse in that game.

24:40.060 --> 24:44.660
There's a mind reading homing horse that can teleport to the bottom of cliffs.

24:44.660 --> 24:49.580
Here are some things that are harder to find than your horse in Red Dead Redemption two.

24:49.580 --> 24:56.100
Your clothes, your friends, your objectives, a satchel with room for more than nine things,

24:56.100 --> 25:02.380
a way to survive without carrying nine pieces of food, a bowl of stew, your own left leg

25:02.380 --> 25:08.020
while taking a bath, the guy that keeps moaning in the hotel in the town of Valentine, a way

25:08.020 --> 25:12.820
to fuck any of the 26 workers in the saloon that compulsively ask you if you want some

25:12.820 --> 25:17.820
company every time you walk by them, interactions with random men that don't force you to choose

25:17.820 --> 25:22.340
between beating the fuck out of them or walking away while they call you a pussy, treasure

25:22.340 --> 25:28.420
maps that function more like maps than Pictionary with an autistic child, a way to win a gunfight

25:28.420 --> 25:33.180
with more than two men that doesn't involve running away and sneaking back seven times,

25:33.180 --> 25:38.860
any recourse whatsoever to role-playing as anything other than a sad, drunk, confused,

25:38.860 --> 25:43.700
psychotic, wobbling through mud, slurring at everyone or hiding in the wilderness, mutilating

25:43.700 --> 25:48.380
animals in the pathetic hope that if you cut enough skin off, enough deer, you might be

25:48.380 --> 25:52.060
able to pick up enough motor function to walk from one end of a room to the other without

25:52.060 --> 25:54.700
accidentally dying or killing.

25:54.700 --> 25:57.540
Well now I want to go home and play somewhere because I just remembered how awesome this

25:57.540 --> 26:09.300
game is. It's good. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Okay, come home now, please. I got to work more,

26:09.300 --> 26:17.300
sorry. I did, I had to work more. Damn. Did you? Well, not as hard as I did on that.

26:17.300 --> 26:22.700
I had this, like one of the last things I did, because the game kind of puts these random

26:22.700 --> 26:28.940
events in front of you, and so it's these two lawmen are pulling a wagon with a prisoner

26:28.940 --> 26:33.900
and just between you and me, the prisoner is like an older black woman, and she's saying

26:33.900 --> 26:38.380
like, I didn't do it. I didn't do anything. I'm innocent. And so I'm like, well, the game

26:38.380 --> 26:42.780
is telling me I got to save this lady. And so I sneak up on him and I shoot him both

26:42.780 --> 26:46.780
in the head, and I'm trying to, I'm trying to hide the bodies because, you know, I don't

26:46.780 --> 26:51.740
want to go get in trouble. And so then another cop comes and I shoot him and then I'm like,

26:51.740 --> 26:55.420
well, I'm just going to let this lady out and run away. And then, so then three more

26:55.420 --> 26:59.300
cops come and I get a big firefight and I kill like four horses on accident. It's a whole

26:59.300 --> 27:03.940
nightmare. I have like a $40 bounty on my head. And then I finally let the old lady out and

27:03.940 --> 27:08.780
she's like, thank you so much. By the way, sonny, there's this old turnip farm down

27:08.780 --> 27:13.220
south that you can rob. And I was like, what the fuck is all these, all these, yeah, everyone,

27:13.220 --> 27:18.380
all these missions, like there's a robbery opportunity. Yeah. It's weird. You know what

27:18.380 --> 27:23.340
it's weird because I never, I was never confused in a Grand Theft Auto game. No, because everyone

27:23.340 --> 27:29.300
sucks. Right. And that was arguably, you know, it's hard culturally and let alone

27:29.300 --> 27:34.180
that and with the with gaming is the fucking epicenter of this like crazy cultural like

27:34.180 --> 27:43.660
the fucking tea cup ride that we've been on. But you know, obviously like like Rockstar

27:43.660 --> 27:48.260
Games in Grand Theft Auto was like this thing was like, hey, it's gaming, it's its own medium.

27:48.260 --> 27:54.180
Not only are we not accountable to standards and practices, we're not accountable to like

27:54.180 --> 28:00.660
any like constructs of morality that even the individual human might have, which you

28:00.660 --> 28:06.260
know, I like like, I understand why people would get alarmed of that later being encroached

28:06.260 --> 28:12.820
upon. I don't know how how much thought the people that get mad put into it. But I I do

28:12.820 --> 28:21.060
remember going, boy, this is this is really actually very valuable latitude to have a medium

28:21.060 --> 28:26.300
in a world where we're such a successful first world empire that our television shows, even

28:26.300 --> 28:30.580
though they've progressed from someone's got to keep their foot on the floor or if they're

28:30.580 --> 28:35.100
in the bedroom together to being able to look at two people wearing pajamas in a bed next

28:35.100 --> 28:39.380
to each other. Let you know, let's let's, you know, we're in danger of stagnation when

28:39.380 --> 28:44.460
we get successful and our media becomes another product like eggs on a shelf that's like so

28:44.460 --> 28:52.860
safe and so policed that, you know, it's like how you get conditioned to react to restrictive

28:52.860 --> 28:59.460
thought, but you know, or anomalous thought with, you know, pulling back. And that's all

28:59.460 --> 29:04.140
I so so I remember playing Grand Theft Auto three and being like, this is valuable. It's

29:04.140 --> 29:11.180
cynical. It's awful. It's so cynical. Right. But it's so it's a it's it's it's valuable

29:11.180 --> 29:18.540
that it's expansive and well being so fucking poisonous. And it's equally poisonous to absolutely

29:18.540 --> 29:24.340
everything about society. Exactly. And it's consistent. And it was just sort of like, you

29:24.340 --> 29:28.620
know, it was that whole like freedom of speech is way more fucking important than than anything

29:28.620 --> 29:34.580
because through that, if you lose that, you're certainly fucked no matter how good you think

29:34.580 --> 29:41.540
you are as a society. And and and and I mean, that's a that's so long ago now and it's weird

29:41.540 --> 29:46.140
to think of it as long ago because that game was so relatively like I just still think

29:46.140 --> 29:51.500
of it as like a recent accomplishment that this Grand Theft Auto three represented this

29:51.500 --> 29:58.860
like gigantic kind of leap forward in sandbox open world gaming. And it's so anyways, but

29:58.860 --> 30:03.100
and then I don't even want to comment because it's such a minefield of like how then we

30:03.100 --> 30:11.100
keep making Grand Theft Auto games and and like even better ones through an era where

30:11.100 --> 30:16.100
like, you know, this Gamergate shit starts happening and people are having these conversations

30:16.100 --> 30:21.660
about what what what cultures are we promoting and why are you mad? Why are you mad? Why

30:21.660 --> 30:24.300
are you mad? What are you trying to protect? I'm not trying to protect any way you're trying

30:24.300 --> 30:27.060
to attack it. I didn't attack anything. Why are you trying to keep everything the same?

30:27.060 --> 30:33.940
I'm not trying to keep shit the same. I want them to do but she's a slut. But it's amazing

30:33.940 --> 30:40.340
to me that that that you know, it's like they had the Old West version of Grand Theft Auto

30:40.340 --> 30:46.300
Red Dead Redemption that this is seven years in the making the sequel to that to that game.

30:46.300 --> 30:49.900
And it's just so it's it's interesting to look at the tightrope that they're walking

30:49.900 --> 30:54.380
the complete difference in like morals. But I think it's a little confusing because I

30:54.380 --> 30:58.780
think it's very confusing. I wouldn't want them to you know what the most moral thing

30:58.780 --> 31:03.460
you can do in Red Dead Redemption is shooting people in the foot and then tying them up

31:03.460 --> 31:08.820
and leaving them in the bushes. That's completely legal. No one will ever follow you for doing

31:08.820 --> 31:12.660
that. What is the come up the come up into like if you get caught by the oh you have

31:12.660 --> 31:16.540
to pay $40 to the post office, you go to the post office and you pay your thing in Grand

31:16.540 --> 31:23.540
Theft Auto. It's not confusing. $40 is a lot of money, Jeff. It's not fucking 2018 in

31:23.540 --> 31:28.180
Grand Theft Auto. You're always in a car. You do something wrong. You get a wanted you

31:28.180 --> 31:33.300
get wanted stars. And the fun of it is if you you know, you got one goal like a little

31:33.300 --> 31:38.060
kid playing tag or something, you know, you got to you have these paint shops around town

31:38.060 --> 31:42.220
is basically one of one of only a few ways that you can if you get during a during a

31:42.220 --> 31:47.740
high speed chase, even if you it keeps increasing in stars. So the more stars you're wanted,

31:47.740 --> 31:52.780
the more levels of law enforcement come out. So you eventually it's helicopters and SWAT

31:52.780 --> 31:57.860
teams and tanks and the National Guard comes to get you. And at any point, you can just

31:57.860 --> 32:04.380
pull into a spray shop and have your car instantly spray painted. And when you pull out, as long

32:04.380 --> 32:09.220
as you don't bump anybody on the backing out, you're you're free again. They're not they

32:09.220 --> 32:13.700
can't find you. Your car is a different color. Now, obviously, that's ridiculous. However,

32:13.700 --> 32:16.980
if you look at it from a gaming mechanics standpoint, it's actually hard to emulate

32:16.980 --> 32:21.740
that in the old West under any circumstances. You can't get your horse painted, your horse

32:21.740 --> 32:25.940
painted, and it somehow works a little better. But my point is, I don't think it's really

32:25.940 --> 32:32.300
an internal logic issue. I think it's that look, I mean, I think it's like, I think it's

32:32.300 --> 32:36.540
like they're great at making these games. I think that part of them being great at making

32:36.540 --> 32:40.660
games is that they have this sort of almost it's ingrained in there, because I see the

32:40.660 --> 32:45.820
same names in the credits. There's, you know, it's not like a new generation of of people

32:45.820 --> 32:50.380
taking over and a brand, they see the same names of designers and stuff. And it's like,

32:50.380 --> 32:55.180
I think that they they probably goes hand in hand, being able to make such a crazy open

32:55.180 --> 33:01.020
world sandbox game and having a mind that's probably pretty allergic to the concept of

33:01.020 --> 33:08.300
putting things on rails, especially morally. However, you got to admit that Red Dead Redemption

33:08.300 --> 33:14.020
2 certainly in a game set in the old West with multiracial characters and a bunch of

33:14.020 --> 33:24.340
women in it, there's a notable absence of of the the degrees of of depth in the moral

33:24.340 --> 33:29.340
sense that the game goes to compared to like, I can't name examples offhand, but you just

33:29.340 --> 33:34.060
kind of sense it. You're like, well, you know, it kind of just tries to slam in your face

33:34.060 --> 33:38.620
that like, no matter what you are, you're kind of the bad guys. And I don't know, which

33:38.620 --> 33:43.660
is the point of it. And to me, I keep getting confused. I think because of that, I think

33:43.660 --> 33:47.460
it's because there's like a, it's like, oh, if I could just get it through my head that

33:47.460 --> 33:52.660
it's Grand Theft Auto on a fucking horse and stop. But I keep being told by the game that

33:52.660 --> 33:56.260
it's horrible when you do bad things, though, unlike in Grand Theft Auto, it feels very

33:56.260 --> 33:59.940
empty. But at this, it's like, I don't know, someone's like, how you doing? And then you

33:59.940 --> 34:04.340
like step on her foot in the horse and she's like, yeah, it just like, it feels it's like,

34:04.340 --> 34:09.140
oh, no, I got to reload my save. Like it feels horrible to do anything wrong in this game

34:09.140 --> 34:11.500
where in Grand Theft Auto, it's kind of like, haha.

34:11.500 --> 34:15.340
Also the sophistication, it doesn't, it's like, it's, it's, it's a, the mechanics are

34:15.340 --> 34:18.940
like, it's a, it's a, it's a great thing. You can like walk and you pull the left trigger

34:18.940 --> 34:22.100
when you see somebody in context when you comes up. So you can kind of experience these things

34:22.100 --> 34:28.660
and like, you walk by, they say random things and you got, you got your binary option of

34:28.660 --> 34:35.140
or I guess triple option because you can, you can diffuse antagonize or greet. But the,

34:35.140 --> 34:40.820
the upshot is that you can walk in real time and almost kind of like marionette a real person

34:40.820 --> 34:47.060
in terms of like verbal encounters with strangers. If that's your jam, if what you want is immersiveness

34:47.060 --> 34:52.180
and you experience walking and, and just howdy, hey, fuck yourself. Hey, you don't got to

34:52.180 --> 34:55.900
be like that and keep walking. And you're, and you're like, you're kind of like, all

34:55.900 --> 35:00.500
of these things are not like times not stopping and you don't have to like, you know, load

35:00.500 --> 35:07.740
this and do that. And, and that's really cool. But the, the downside of that is if you're

35:07.740 --> 35:14.620
really immersed in this world, you're walking around and people are constantly saying, I

35:14.620 --> 35:20.340
don't like the looks in your face. And I'm like, and all you can do is tie him up and

35:20.340 --> 35:25.220
toss him in a bush. It's like, it's like, you know, from a gaming perspective that there's

35:25.220 --> 35:30.500
no profit in stopping and doing anything with this person. But it's like so immersive now

35:30.500 --> 35:35.700
that I'm like, I'm the guy that it took, it took so long to go bisexual and fall out.

35:35.700 --> 35:41.100
It's like, you know, because I, I just like, I have this like, I'm like, I, I, I, it's

35:41.100 --> 35:44.980
part of my, I think my clinical narcissism is that you can really get me into a game

35:44.980 --> 35:49.140
and I, and tell me that, you know, that's me. And then I'll take that really seriously.

35:49.140 --> 35:52.700
You can't be bisexual and red dead. I, well, I don't know.

35:52.700 --> 35:54.980
You can't even have sex with the, with the sex workers there.

35:54.980 --> 35:57.820
Yeah. He doesn't seem to be into women for whatever reason.

35:57.820 --> 36:02.620
One thing that I was confused by, you said one of the hard things to do in, in red dead

36:02.620 --> 36:06.020
redemption too is you can't find your left leg in a bathtub.

36:06.020 --> 36:07.020
Oh yeah.

36:07.020 --> 36:10.820
Yeah. That's a real thing. You take a bath, sometimes you have to pay 50 cents to do that.

36:10.820 --> 36:15.380
And if you go and take a bath, that event, you, after you finish washing your head, there's

36:15.380 --> 36:18.980
a knock on the door and a woman says, would you like, would you like some help in there?

36:18.980 --> 36:24.180
And if you pay 50 cents, a woman will come in and this goes to this kind of labyrinth

36:24.180 --> 36:26.020
thing. There's no game to it, right?

36:26.020 --> 36:29.620
No, you just press, you just press any number of buttons that you want to.

36:29.620 --> 36:33.660
Just indicating what part of your body you want washed. And then there's an option to

36:33.660 --> 36:38.740
make small talk while you're doing it. And she responds with, you know, algorithmically.

36:38.740 --> 36:43.740
And she, I was like, Oh, it's, it's like, it's eventually this is you're going to unlock

36:43.740 --> 36:45.420
a hand job or something.

36:45.420 --> 36:48.220
That's what it leads you to believe. But I don't know. After the first one, I was like,

36:48.220 --> 36:50.620
this just seems like a red herring to me.

36:50.620 --> 36:55.340
It's really weird. But then again, that's what I mean, Grand Theft Auto was kind of,

36:55.340 --> 36:59.020
they let it leak that there was a way to get a sex worker in your car.

36:59.020 --> 37:01.420
Oh, that's different. I was thinking the hot coffee.

37:01.420 --> 37:06.940
It wasn't like an automatic thing. Anyways, but there's no, there's no funny business,

37:06.940 --> 37:08.380
no sex happening in the game.

37:08.380 --> 37:12.660
Not unless you assume something's happening under the water that is both instantaneous

37:12.660 --> 37:16.940
and that he has a poker face about it because he's, that he's a cowboy and he doesn't want

37:16.940 --> 37:17.940
to.

37:17.940 --> 37:21.900
But in a lot of the interactions, it sets up that he's kind of just not interested

37:21.900 --> 37:23.780
in anyone who expresses.

37:23.780 --> 37:25.140
Let's spread a rumor that he's gay.

37:25.140 --> 37:29.980
Well, I mean, yeah, who knows, he might be, but he certainly doesn't seem into it. He

37:29.980 --> 37:30.980
pisses people off.

37:30.980 --> 37:32.860
He's an asexual cowboy.

37:32.860 --> 37:33.860
It's great.

37:33.860 --> 37:38.780
That would be a huge advantage in the old West, I think, to be asexual.

37:38.780 --> 37:44.700
That's true because he's always having to go after like women and haul them into prison

37:44.700 --> 37:49.460
and stuff. You know, you can't be seducted or, you know,

37:49.460 --> 37:54.420
I have asexual questions. Is anybody openly asexual? Also, is that a thing?

37:54.420 --> 37:56.500
Like, or is it a thing?

37:56.500 --> 37:57.500
Yeah.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.180
Are you, I'm not even going to make eye contact because I don't want to put you in the spot.

38:00.180 --> 38:03.860
If you don't want to be put on the spot, are you, are you, are you self-applying that,

38:03.860 --> 38:04.860
that phrase?

38:04.860 --> 38:05.860
Oh, okay.

38:05.860 --> 38:08.340
Me neither, by the way.

38:08.340 --> 38:13.460
But yeah, if anybody, if anybody, if anybody's like, like, confidently like, yeah, I'm asexual,

38:13.460 --> 38:17.580
that's what I identify as. I'd love to have a conversation with you if you don't mind

38:17.580 --> 38:18.580
being asked.

38:18.580 --> 38:19.580
Especially if you're also a cowboy.

38:19.580 --> 38:20.580
Some naive.

38:20.580 --> 38:21.580
That would be great.

38:21.580 --> 38:22.580
That would be, but I would consider that great.

38:22.580 --> 38:23.580
We'll get a fucking asexual cowboy up our faces.

38:23.580 --> 38:24.580
We're going to be podcast dynamite.

38:24.580 --> 38:25.580
We're going to be a cowboy.

38:25.580 --> 38:26.580
We're going to be a cowboy.

38:26.580 --> 38:27.580
We're going to be a cowboy.

38:27.580 --> 38:28.580
We're going to be a cowboy.

38:28.580 --> 38:30.580
We have a cowboy.

38:30.580 --> 38:35.700
You know, if you're, if you really follow the code of what we understand to be the true

38:35.700 --> 38:39.180
cowboy, you would be asexual, wouldn't you?

38:39.180 --> 38:40.180
Well, yeah.

38:40.180 --> 38:41.180
Buy?

38:41.180 --> 38:42.180
Why buy?

38:42.180 --> 38:43.180
Okay.

38:43.180 --> 38:51.980
True cowboys, true cowboys have sex with land genies.

38:51.980 --> 38:57.700
You just want bisexuality to get, you know, signal boosted in any context.

38:57.700 --> 39:02.700
You're like, you're like that guy at every protest that has the legalized weed.

39:02.700 --> 39:07.700
I think like the, a lot of cowboys, when they, because they always leave at the end, you

39:07.700 --> 39:11.020
know, like Shane or you know, like, they write off in the sense that they're like, they're

39:11.020 --> 39:14.380
like, bye-bye sexual, like, bye-bye.

39:14.380 --> 39:15.380
Yeah.

39:15.380 --> 39:18.380
Thank you.

39:18.380 --> 39:21.820
It is kind of defined at least in silver screen terms as like, you know, I mean, one of the

39:21.820 --> 39:25.740
major foundations is for sure, unless you're a bad guy, you don't, you don't, you don't

39:25.740 --> 39:33.140
cross boundaries with an unwilling filly, you know, like you, you're certainly not maybe

39:33.140 --> 39:40.980
regarding women as equals in a society governed by reason, but that's, a lot of that's not

39:40.980 --> 39:42.340
your fault as a cowboy.

39:42.340 --> 39:47.900
You're just, you're just a cowboy, but you, but, but you definitely are, you know, you're

39:47.900 --> 39:54.460
not, you're never gonna, you wouldn't be a good cowboy if you, if you took liberties.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.460
Right.

39:55.460 --> 39:59.060
So, what'd you say?

39:59.060 --> 40:00.900
Waterworld?

40:00.900 --> 40:05.980
Waterworld by contrast.

40:05.980 --> 40:12.300
Even in childhood, women are nothing more than maps to dry land.

40:12.300 --> 40:15.580
Something to draw upon.

40:15.580 --> 40:19.660
But there isn't a lot of westerns because there was, there were small cast, small sets, and

40:19.660 --> 40:24.300
usually not a lot of women characters because of, for a lot of reasons, but one that actresses

40:24.300 --> 40:30.700
were expensive, like to get a big star like, like, like, you know, Hollywood star in the,

40:30.700 --> 40:35.820
in the thing, that in the same way, kind of like in Die Hard, there's, there's often

40:35.820 --> 40:40.660
scenes in, in westerns where the bad guy and the good guy meet and it's almost flirtatious.

40:40.660 --> 40:41.660
It's kind of like this.

40:41.660 --> 40:42.660
Right.

40:42.660 --> 40:46.580
Where there's kind of a sexual vibe to it, like in Shane with Jack Pounds when he sees

40:46.580 --> 40:51.300
Alan Ladd, like, he kind of checks him out and it's, it's kind of like, it's, it's, it's

40:51.300 --> 40:53.300
almost a little like sexy.

40:53.300 --> 40:54.300
Well, definitely.

40:54.300 --> 40:55.300
Yeah.

40:55.300 --> 40:58.300
I mean, they certainly land that in Westworld with Yule Brenner and, let's just say, I mean,

40:58.300 --> 41:01.300
it's like, like, even though he's a robot pretending to be a bad guy, kind of like,

41:01.300 --> 41:02.300
Richard Benjamin.

41:02.300 --> 41:03.300
Very sexual.

41:03.300 --> 41:07.300
It's one, it's one actor with no eyebrows, another actor who has just 90% eyebrows.

41:07.300 --> 41:10.300
Why don't you go home to your mama?

41:10.300 --> 41:12.300
That movie sucks.

41:12.300 --> 41:15.300
It starts off great.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.300
It starts off so good.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.300
Why are we in Rome now?

41:19.300 --> 41:22.900
Like, like, they go to like, it's just, I just love the idea of the river in that movie,

41:22.900 --> 41:28.700
the way that you can tell these, these, these robots that you can have sex with that look

41:28.700 --> 41:30.900
like, so we'll look at their hands though.

41:30.900 --> 41:34.900
They can't, science can't recreate the poem.

41:34.900 --> 41:36.900
The fingertips are all weird.

41:36.900 --> 41:38.900
That's how we felt in the 70s.

41:38.900 --> 41:40.900
We felt like, we're going to, we're going to get there.

41:40.900 --> 41:43.900
You know, you see these Halloween masks this year, they're pretty, but they're getting,

41:43.900 --> 41:45.900
that guy looks a lot like Nixon.

41:45.900 --> 41:51.900
And we just kind of, I think we thought like, yeah, you know, that hand, we were all intelligent

41:51.900 --> 41:52.900
design people.

41:52.900 --> 41:55.900
They were like, how do you, how do you ever make a fake hand?

41:55.900 --> 41:56.900
It's a robot.

41:56.900 --> 41:58.900
It's going to have claws.

41:58.900 --> 42:02.900
We can make a guy look just like your runner.

42:02.900 --> 42:05.900
Yeah, I rewatched that with church.

42:05.900 --> 42:08.900
Speaking of Hollywood in the 70s and weird things.

42:08.900 --> 42:12.900
Here's a podcast recommend.

42:12.900 --> 42:16.900
There's an Australian podcast called Fatal Voyage.

42:16.900 --> 42:20.900
It's a reexamination of Natalie Wood's death.

42:20.900 --> 42:25.900
I guess that, I guess that, I guess, I guess it was technically reopened or something.

42:25.900 --> 42:29.900
Like, because the captain that was on the boat.

42:29.900 --> 42:36.900
For those of you who don't know Natalie Wood, she was an incredibly famous actor.

42:36.900 --> 42:42.900
She, she married for a second time, Robert Wagner, who's still alive.

42:42.900 --> 42:44.900
He was in this show called Heart to Heart.

42:44.900 --> 42:46.900
And before that he was a movie star.

42:46.900 --> 42:53.900
They had a, you know, the Natalie Wood was in a movie called Brainstorm with Christopher

42:53.900 --> 42:54.900
Walken.

42:54.900 --> 42:58.900
For some reason, this is the part that really confuses Schrab a lot more than it does me,

42:58.900 --> 43:02.900
because I've always, I've always equated Christopher Walken with you.

43:02.900 --> 43:06.900
Like, I always, why?

43:06.900 --> 43:09.900
And I imagine coming off of the deer hunter and having an Oscar.

43:09.900 --> 43:13.900
Like, like, like, like Schrab is, Schrab just can't get his mind around it.

43:13.900 --> 43:21.900
It's like, why, who invites Christopher Walken alone onto a boat to Catalina and just hand,

43:21.900 --> 43:23.900
and I'm like, doesn't it seem like something Jeff would just be like,

43:23.900 --> 43:25.900
hmm, Natalie Wood, do you know what I mean, are you got?

43:25.900 --> 43:26.900
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go.

43:26.900 --> 43:29.900
Anything you want me to ask her?

43:29.900 --> 43:31.900
And that you wouldn't bring a date.

43:31.900 --> 43:34.900
Is that how I sound?

43:34.900 --> 43:39.900
Hey boo boo, hey boo boo, hey boo boo.

43:39.900 --> 43:40.900
Why am I a yokey bear?

43:40.900 --> 43:42.900
What am I, rich little?

43:42.900 --> 43:44.900
Hey boo boo, hey boo boo.

43:44.900 --> 43:46.900
I had to make you sound different from me.

43:46.900 --> 43:49.900
Okay.

43:49.900 --> 43:56.900
But anyways, but just, I mean, for those who are totally un indoctrinated to this sort of like legendary kind of Hollywood Babylon thing,

43:56.900 --> 44:03.900
where Natalie Wood drowned that weekend, and it was like, there were four people on the boat,

44:03.900 --> 44:06.900
including the captain, and one of them ended up dead, and there was never a,

44:06.900 --> 44:09.900
it was never really regarded as a homicide.

44:09.900 --> 44:13.900
And so, all this time, it's always just been this thing of like,

44:13.900 --> 44:17.900
something fucked up went on on that boat, and there's, there, there was always the,

44:17.900 --> 44:25.900
I always, I always thought it was very silly and kind of provincial of people to go.

44:25.900 --> 44:31.900
Well, the two automatic courses are like, obviously it's like, he was a jealous kind of husband,

44:31.900 --> 44:36.900
he had a jealousy streak, he once followed Warren Beatty home with a gun because she was in a movie with him,

44:36.900 --> 44:41.900
and he was like, you know, he's, he's capable of going there and jealous, jealousy.

44:41.900 --> 44:43.900
So, obviously that's the first place.

44:43.900 --> 44:46.900
Which is a big predictor for like serious male violence and murder.

44:46.900 --> 44:51.900
It's obviously the first place you'd go in a regular, even regular death as you look at the husband first,

44:51.900 --> 44:57.900
let alone if he's the only one capable of being near you, and there's a history there.

44:57.900 --> 45:01.900
And there's four people on the boat, so there's the captain, Christopher Walken, the guy and the girl.

45:01.900 --> 45:02.900
Right.

45:02.900 --> 45:08.900
And I always thought, and so that, that always makes sense to me, but I always thought it was like a very kind of Midwestern

45:08.900 --> 45:15.900
holly, looking at Hollywood thing that people would go, you know what really happened is Robert Wagner was fucking Christopher Walken.

45:15.900 --> 45:18.900
Natalie Wood walked in and she was like, that's it.

45:18.900 --> 45:20.900
And they clubbed her to death and threw her in the water.

45:20.900 --> 45:21.900
I'm like, come on.

45:21.900 --> 45:26.900
Like, why, why do we, why do we just, because that's the only other scenario that you can imagine.

45:26.900 --> 45:29.900
And it's like, oh, Hollywood's bisexual and all this stuff.

45:29.900 --> 45:32.900
But it, and then I'm going to turn this podcast over to you.

45:32.900 --> 45:37.900
So I don't want to spoil everything, but it does turn out that Robert Wagner, that he was married to Natalie Wood twice.

45:37.900 --> 45:45.900
And the reason they got divorced the first time is because she caught him in an affair with a man.

45:45.900 --> 45:46.900
Oh, really?

45:46.900 --> 45:51.900
And so that doesn't automatically mean you're going to fuck Christopher Walken as I'm connecting those dots.

45:51.900 --> 45:54.900
But I was surprised to find that out and was like, holy shit.

45:54.900 --> 45:58.900
But I said, but yeah, and so if we were to continue to talk about it, I tell you.

45:58.900 --> 45:59.900
What was the podcast?

45:59.900 --> 46:02.900
It's called Fatal Voyage.

46:02.900 --> 46:05.900
It's just like one of those like one-off kind of mini-series.

46:05.900 --> 46:06.900
Hell yeah.

46:06.900 --> 46:07.900
That sounds awesome.

46:07.900 --> 46:09.900
You know what I think?

46:09.900 --> 46:17.900
It's another one called the RFK tapes, I think.

46:17.900 --> 46:24.900
These are all, Cody finds these and we sleep to podcasts, but I think it's called the RFK tapes, RFK something.

46:24.900 --> 46:35.900
It's a re-examination of the assassination of Robert Kennedy by this like weird guy, Sirhan Sirhan.

46:35.900 --> 46:51.900
And a really fascinating, like intimate examination of a really nice, smart, cool guy who is absolutely convinced that this is an elaborate conspiracy.

46:51.900 --> 46:54.900
And he doesn't have tin foil on his head.

46:54.900 --> 46:55.900
He's not defensive.

46:55.900 --> 46:59.900
He doesn't start throwing things if you say you think he's full of shit.

46:59.900 --> 47:12.900
So it's like very, and yet what he believes is the case is so hard to believe.

47:12.900 --> 47:16.900
But it's fun to listen to for a couple episodes.

47:16.900 --> 47:25.900
The couple being, it's totality, and I don't mean it takes a shit in the middle.

47:25.900 --> 47:32.900
Yeah, I like to come to Harmontown and get my recommendations for other podcasts.

47:32.900 --> 47:36.900
If you haven't listened to Heavyweight are ever on...

47:36.900 --> 47:44.900
I go to Trader Joe's to get coupons to Ralph's.

47:44.900 --> 47:46.900
My friend Rob Corddry was on this show.

47:46.900 --> 47:48.900
It's a good entry point if you don't have any other.

47:48.900 --> 47:50.900
But there's this show called Heavyweight.

47:50.900 --> 47:55.900
Now I can't remember the guy's name, John Goldstein or something like that.

47:55.900 --> 47:59.900
But it's a network, Gimlet Media.

47:59.900 --> 48:03.900
He's this guy who just gets up in other people's business.

48:03.900 --> 48:04.900
So if you have a...

48:04.900 --> 48:11.900
I think it's called Heavyweight because it usually deals with shit that's weighed on people for a while and has been unresolved.

48:11.900 --> 48:17.900
People come to him and say, I haven't spoken to my aunt in 30 years

48:17.900 --> 48:20.900
and I'm convinced it's because she thinks I'm racist or whatever.

48:20.900 --> 48:24.900
We had an argument over pretzels at this lake house or whatever.

48:24.900 --> 48:26.900
I just can't talk to her.

48:26.900 --> 48:29.900
I get these mixed signals and all this stuff and then he'll just call her.

48:29.900 --> 48:37.900
He just kind of realized at some point in his life that the only thing he was good at was...

48:37.900 --> 48:38.900
Resolving stuff?

48:38.900 --> 48:40.900
Getting his nose in everybody's business.

48:40.900 --> 48:42.900
Does he fix shit?

48:42.900 --> 48:44.900
Yeah, no, he very much does.

48:44.900 --> 48:47.900
Otherwise he would be a horrible person.

48:47.900 --> 48:49.900
Sounds like a Red Dead redemption character.

48:49.900 --> 48:51.900
He's got a very high resolution rate.

48:51.900 --> 48:55.900
Even when it sometimes it turns out that the person that thought that their issue was with someone else,

48:55.900 --> 48:59.900
it turns out that they need to confront somebody about themselves and he'll successfully get that.

48:59.900 --> 49:05.900
Alright, so you're Red Dead, you're walking around, somebody calls you an asshole, you step on their foot, they scream.

49:05.900 --> 49:12.900
What button, physically, how do you tie somebody up? What's the interface that you use a rope to tie somebody up?

49:12.900 --> 49:16.900
Well first, Jeff, you'd hold down the LB button to bring up your weapon wheel.

49:16.900 --> 49:19.900
Hopefully you have your lap so equipped already.

49:19.900 --> 49:22.900
Yeah, hopefully you loaded that out for when you got off your horse.

49:22.900 --> 49:23.900
Or you're on your horse.

49:23.900 --> 49:27.900
And you use the control stick to select it.

49:27.900 --> 49:30.900
And then now you have your rope equip.

49:30.900 --> 49:36.900
And then you hold down the R trigger, I think, and the L trigger to aim and swing it around.

49:36.900 --> 49:40.900
Oh man, you're aiming and you let it go by letting go the trigger.

49:40.900 --> 49:45.900
And then I think you then immediately have to hit the trigger again to hold on to it.

49:45.900 --> 49:50.900
Otherwise, when you tie them up, you will immediately let them go and they will get up and run away.

49:50.900 --> 49:58.900
But if you hold the trigger and you hold them tied up and then you can slowly walk to them and hog tie them with the B button.

49:58.900 --> 50:00.900
Thank you very much, Spencer.

50:00.900 --> 50:04.900
Yeah, my first bounty was that black widow lady.

50:04.900 --> 50:06.900
That's why it's good to be asexual in that game.

50:06.900 --> 50:08.900
Think of what she'd pulled.

50:08.900 --> 50:10.900
Well, I wasn't tempted to do anything.

50:10.900 --> 50:12.900
She tries to tempt you.

50:12.900 --> 50:14.900
Well, I know, but I'm not.

50:14.900 --> 50:20.900
But I got my lasso out and I was like, I'm not having any conversation with this person.

50:20.900 --> 50:26.900
I successfully lassoed her from my horse, but then getting off my horse I let go of the rope.

50:26.900 --> 50:29.900
She got up and just immediately, it was like a nightmare.

50:29.900 --> 50:32.900
She came up at the moment and started slashing me with a knife.

50:32.900 --> 50:34.900
And then I just did what I always do.

50:34.900 --> 50:36.900
I ran.

50:36.900 --> 50:41.900
I spent so much of that game just running off into the wilderness.

50:41.900 --> 50:49.900
And then come back around in a big circle while they slowly forget I ever existed and go back to doing what they were doing.

50:49.900 --> 50:54.900
If you lasso somebody but don't hold down the trigger once they're lassoed, do they get up and run away?

50:54.900 --> 50:56.900
Yeah, it's like you've essentially just tripped them.

50:56.900 --> 50:58.900
But now you've also lost your rope.

50:58.900 --> 51:00.900
No, no, you have infinite rope for some reason.

51:00.900 --> 51:02.900
Yeah, your infinite rope.

51:02.900 --> 51:04.900
Oh yeah, it's great.

51:04.900 --> 51:13.900
Yeah, no, but I that same exact thing happened to me and then she like slashed me like four times and I was almost dead and I like ran off 15 feet and then tied her up.

51:13.900 --> 51:15.900
It was great.

51:15.900 --> 51:19.900
You really that's the only thing you could do in this game is tie people up.

51:19.900 --> 51:21.900
It's amazing.

51:21.900 --> 51:23.900
It sounds terrible.

51:23.900 --> 51:25.900
Yeah, you could also shoot animals.

51:25.900 --> 51:26.900
It's a gorgeous game.

51:26.900 --> 51:34.900
I mean, it's really like the combination of the kind of the dedication of some team over there because I remember Grand Theft Auto 5 came out.

51:34.900 --> 51:36.900
Is that the one where you're Russian?

51:36.900 --> 51:37.900
I think four.

51:37.900 --> 51:40.900
I remember there was a kind of like, I think there's, you know, there's people.

51:40.900 --> 51:48.900
You can imagine there's probably camps that are like, we need to make this thing look fucking gorgeous and have all these details and you should be able to have a cell phone and farm potatoes.

51:48.900 --> 51:57.900
And that there are times that those teams are the enemy of a good game because you're just like, just make it a little better than San Andreas and we will all would have been so happy.

51:57.900 --> 52:05.900
But then I mean, I think this game represents that camp getting getting getting to have their day in court.

52:05.900 --> 52:07.900
They're like, the technology is here.

52:07.900 --> 52:09.900
The screens are 4k.

52:09.900 --> 52:14.900
The boxes can run it like, let's make a let it be photo realistic.

52:14.900 --> 52:15.900
No cut scenes.

52:15.900 --> 52:19.900
They try so hard for there to never be any transition to anything.

52:19.900 --> 52:23.900
So you're just like walking through saloon doors and then you're in the saloon until you leave.

52:23.900 --> 52:25.900
And there's never any loading or anything.

52:25.900 --> 52:27.900
Well, there is some loading.

52:27.900 --> 52:29.900
Don't write letters.

52:29.900 --> 52:31.900
There's no guests.

52:31.900 --> 52:32.900
My feet are tired.

52:32.900 --> 52:34.900
I usually don't sit down until there's a guest.

52:34.900 --> 52:39.900
Nova, do you want to come up or are you tired of being exploited?

52:39.900 --> 52:40.900
Okay.

52:40.900 --> 52:41.900
Our guest, Nova.

52:41.900 --> 52:52.900
Can I just quickly give a plug?

52:52.900 --> 52:55.900
We still need some audience members for Wednesday to Friday.

52:55.900 --> 53:01.900
So if you guys want a free show sometime this week, come come to harm a quest tapings harm a quest dot com particular.

53:01.900 --> 53:03.900
Oh yeah, we're doing that in a couple days.

53:03.900 --> 53:09.900
Yeah, Saturday and Sunday, I think are full, but we really we really could use some more people.

53:09.900 --> 53:11.900
They're free seats, I think.

53:11.900 --> 53:14.900
So Wednesday to Friday this week, if you guys are interested.

53:14.900 --> 53:15.900
Wednesday.

53:15.900 --> 53:21.900
I'm going to get my hair cut by the person whose job is supposedly only to comb my hair.

53:21.900 --> 53:23.900
Oh, no.

53:23.900 --> 53:25.900
I'm sure they're stoked about that.

53:25.900 --> 53:26.900
Yeah.

53:26.900 --> 53:29.900
So I get paid the same, but I have to touch your fucking gross scalp.

53:29.900 --> 53:32.900
Are we doing like any kind of meeting?

53:32.900 --> 53:33.900
Have a meeting before this?

53:33.900 --> 53:37.900
Or am I just showing up to the thing in two days and we're just going to start bone-weave a little bit again?

53:37.900 --> 53:38.900
I'd love to talk to you.

53:38.900 --> 53:41.900
I don't know when Erin's showing up, but yeah, I mean, we should do that.

53:41.900 --> 53:42.900
Absolutely.

53:42.900 --> 53:44.900
We should do a lot of things to prepare.

53:44.900 --> 53:45.900
It really caught me off guard.

53:45.900 --> 53:53.900
I was thinking among many things that ex-wife Erin McGathy would buy before we were taping that she would probably pop by the show and

53:53.900 --> 53:55.900
reconnoit her with the audience.

53:55.900 --> 53:56.900
Hello, Nova.

53:56.900 --> 53:57.900
Hello.

53:57.900 --> 53:58.900
Sorry, Nova.

53:58.900 --> 53:59.900
No, no problem.

53:59.900 --> 54:00.900
How are you doing?

54:00.900 --> 54:01.900
Good.

54:01.900 --> 54:02.900
Why?

54:02.900 --> 54:04.900
That seemed a little equivocal.

54:04.900 --> 54:10.900
No, I'm just, I don't know, I'm in a weird mood, but yeah, I've been good.

54:10.900 --> 54:11.900
Yeah.

54:11.900 --> 54:12.900
I'm sold.

54:12.900 --> 54:13.900
Fair enough.

54:13.900 --> 54:20.900
When I'm in a weird mood, I usually find that when people pester me about it, it makes me explain.

54:20.900 --> 54:21.900
It makes you normal, right?

54:21.900 --> 54:22.900
Yeah.

54:22.900 --> 54:23.900
It just evens it out.

54:23.900 --> 54:29.900
Well, it usually leads to me being so desperate to feel something that I'll even exaggerate shit.

54:29.900 --> 54:36.900
And it'll be a conversation that ends with the person going, Jesus Christ, well, God, feel better.

54:36.900 --> 54:39.900
Well, you kept asking me how I was.

54:39.900 --> 54:41.900
I had to make something up.

54:41.900 --> 54:42.900
Oh.

54:42.900 --> 54:48.900
But is your weird mood, do those still waters actually run deep?

54:48.900 --> 54:49.900
Yeah.

54:49.900 --> 54:50.900
I don't know.

54:50.900 --> 54:56.900
I'm in a weird place right now because I don't want to talk forever or anything.

54:56.900 --> 55:03.900
But yeah, I've been trying to get down my anxiety, so I've started meditating and then...

55:03.900 --> 55:04.900
That's great.

55:04.900 --> 55:05.900
Yeah, I'm going to try.

55:05.900 --> 55:09.900
By the way, when has anyone on the show ever gotten away with talking anywhere near forever except me?

55:09.900 --> 55:10.900
That's true.

55:10.900 --> 55:12.900
Yeah, no, I'll be interrupted if I talk too much.

55:12.900 --> 55:13.900
That's good.

55:13.900 --> 55:16.900
You'll be interrupted if you're sharing a really deeply personal thing.

55:16.900 --> 55:18.900
I'll be like, well, let me tell you about that.

55:18.900 --> 55:19.900
Yeah.

55:19.900 --> 55:23.900
And I'm going to try to eat better and more regularly, and I'm going to try to start exercising,

55:23.900 --> 55:27.900
and hopefully that'll bring my anxiety down, and I'll be able to function better.

55:27.900 --> 55:32.900
It hasn't destroyed my anxiety, but it has helped somewhat to exercise, so I hope you get some relief from that.

55:32.900 --> 55:35.900
I think it'll be good, yeah, especially like the meditation.

55:35.900 --> 55:40.900
And it's kind of that, and then I'm happy, and I'm doing things I like, and I'm starting to relax.

55:40.900 --> 55:44.900
But then there's also, like, I'm having all these existential crises,

55:44.900 --> 55:48.900
and I'm upset about all the awful things happening, which usually I never pay attention to,

55:48.900 --> 55:50.900
but lately it's really hit me bad.

55:50.900 --> 55:51.900
Sure.

55:51.900 --> 55:55.900
And so it's this weird kind of, I'm just having a weird kind of time at home,

55:55.900 --> 56:02.900
kind of having existential crises and feeling bad, and then kind of like finding how to make it okay,

56:02.900 --> 56:05.900
and kind of having fun and stuff, so, yeah.

56:05.900 --> 56:10.900
At home, I know you're quite young, and you live in with the folks.

56:10.900 --> 56:11.900
Yeah.

56:11.900 --> 56:21.900
And you're, stop me if I, I only know so much about you, and I assume none of it is things that you don't want me to blurt into a microphone,

56:21.900 --> 56:26.900
but your dad picked you up from the show when they were talking.

56:26.900 --> 56:28.900
Yeah, he takes me here.

56:28.900 --> 56:31.900
He drops you off, he doesn't come in to watch, he's just like, go watch that podcast.

56:31.900 --> 56:33.900
Yeah, he drops me off, yeah.

56:33.900 --> 56:39.900
He works from home, so he can pick up his stuff and work at a coffee shop or anywhere, and he likes to get out of the house.

56:39.900 --> 56:42.900
So it's good for both of us, he definitely doesn't mind it.

56:42.900 --> 56:45.900
Do you mind talking about the situation at home?

56:45.900 --> 56:46.900
Sure.

56:46.900 --> 56:49.900
Is it anxiety inducing right now?

56:49.900 --> 56:59.900
Oh, no, I just kind of, I've realized, I've been, well yeah, if we want to get deep, that's fine.

56:59.900 --> 57:01.900
What do you think these people are craving?

57:01.900 --> 57:04.900
I just talked about other people's podcasts for 40 minutes.

57:04.900 --> 57:09.900
There needs to be bloodshed, or they're going to be like, I want my $8, $10 back.

57:09.900 --> 57:13.900
Well, yeah, I mean, life has been weird for a while.

57:13.900 --> 57:18.900
In senior year, I went into like a half-homeschool program that turned out to be the worst thing for me,

57:18.900 --> 57:22.900
because there was no structure, so I barely graduated.

57:22.900 --> 57:24.900
Should have gone full homeschool.

57:24.900 --> 57:27.900
That's a joke at the expense of our public school system.

57:27.900 --> 57:28.900
Oh, yeah.

57:28.900 --> 57:31.900
No, I should have definitely stated it.

57:31.900 --> 57:34.900
Just for me, just for me, homeschool can be great.

57:34.900 --> 57:36.900
That's a real criticism of her parents' homeschooling ability.

57:36.900 --> 57:41.900
No, because it was on me, because it was a half-homeschool program where the students kind of decided their own curriculum's almost,

57:41.900 --> 57:46.900
and a lot of them did really well, because there were kind of different kind of kids, and a lot of them were geniuses and stuff,

57:46.900 --> 57:50.900
but for me, it did not work. I needed structure, and yeah.

57:50.900 --> 57:53.900
You mean a lot of these programs typically go well, because you're referring to other kids?

57:53.900 --> 57:58.900
No, I just meant mine. I don't know about other ones, but homeschool can be really good for certain people.

57:58.900 --> 58:00.900
Okay, yeah.

58:00.900 --> 58:03.900
Usually kids that are like, they could be two grades ahead,

58:03.900 --> 58:08.900
or they're really, really interested in a super specific thing, and really good at it, or things like that.

58:08.900 --> 58:13.900
Do you have recourse to therapy? Are you in any kind of therapy?

58:13.900 --> 58:14.900
Yeah.

58:14.900 --> 58:16.900
Yeah, I've been in therapy for like two years.

58:16.900 --> 58:20.900
Well, I've been in and out of therapy since I was like a kid, but I've had one.

58:20.900 --> 58:25.900
That person probably tells you not to blame yourself for, like, a lot, right?

58:25.900 --> 58:26.900
Yes.

58:26.900 --> 58:34.900
Yeah, yeah. I get guilty about kind of like being the way I am or something, or I kind of used to,

58:34.900 --> 58:39.900
and she tries to tell me like, no, it makes sense why you are, how you are, and it doesn't matter anyway.

58:39.900 --> 58:44.900
I try to be, sometimes I'll be like, why is this thing, you know, about me, and great grammar,

58:44.900 --> 58:50.900
and she'll be like, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that it's like here and what we do about it,

58:50.900 --> 58:55.900
and if we accept it or if we try to get rid of it or whatever, it doesn't matter how or why things are the way they are.

58:55.900 --> 58:58.900
Yeah, that's a very religious question.

58:58.900 --> 59:01.900
Oh, I guess it's kind of existential.

59:01.900 --> 59:03.900
Yeah. Why am I having this problem? Like, yeah.

59:03.900 --> 59:06.900
That is really existential. I've thought about that a lot. Yeah.

59:06.900 --> 59:12.900
I like that aspect of modern therapy, that there's been a swing into the focus on the concept of happiness,

59:12.900 --> 59:20.900
and that, like, that my therapist is constantly saying, because I'll accidentally ask her, like,

59:20.900 --> 59:23.900
I don't know, should I do this or should I do that, or some kind of question that's more subjective,

59:23.900 --> 59:27.900
and she'll go, look, I don't know, I'm your mechanic, I'm here to make you happy.

59:27.900 --> 59:28.900
Oh, interesting.

59:28.900 --> 59:33.900
Right, like, it's like, like, like, that's the goal is for me to be happy,

59:33.900 --> 59:38.900
not for me to be a good person necessarily, although those things tend to go hand in hand,

59:38.900 --> 59:43.900
because if you have a definition of good person and you achieve it, you're probably going to be happier

59:43.900 --> 59:46.900
than if you live in defiance of your concept of goodness.

59:46.900 --> 59:51.900
Yeah, well, that's my thing too, is that I have extremely high moral standards, just for myself,

59:51.900 --> 59:58.900
not even for anybody other than myself, but despite the fact that I don't think I come anywhere close

59:58.900 --> 01:00:02.900
to meeting those or even other people's standards, I'm constantly told all the time,

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.900
mostly by my therapist, that I'm too hard on myself and that I'm too critical,

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.900
and I'm like, really, are you sure?

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:11.900
Like, you know, are you sure I shouldn't be harder on myself even than I am?

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.900
And she's just like, no.

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.900
But yeah, what was I gonna...

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:24.900
Yeah, for me, it's usually pretty much everything I've ever had that I brought into therapy has been like,

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:29.900
it's okay, though, like, you know, it's not that big a deal or kind of like, and not in a fake way,

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:34.900
but really just like, no, that's fine, like, it's okay, or I don't know.

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:39.900
I almost, I detect a tone in your voice that's like, if you're like me, that's a little dissatisfying.

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.900
You want some good wills to get hunted.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.900
Yes.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.900
You want epiphanies, you want to do dramatic work.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.900
I was crazy, yeah.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:54.900
I spent a lot, I did what my first 10 therapists, I would very often pull out the insult challenge,

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:58.900
was like, look, I've been here three times, like, what do you get paid to do?

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.900
I'm still fucking crazy.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.900
You know what, yeah, what my problem is is that I'm extremely self-aware,

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.900
so I'll go into therapists and I'll explain all these things about myself,

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:09.900
and you know, I think it could be caused by this thing, and I think this might be a way to fix it and blah, blah, blah,

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:13.900
and I'm like, and people are noticing this about me, and that's not the way I was,

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.900
they're just like, I don't know what to do.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:17.900
Yeah.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:24.900
That's why my current therapist is really good, and I don't know, she's very honest as far as I can tell at least.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.900
Or very good at being dishonest.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:28.900
Exactly.

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:32.900
What did she do for all our therapists listening?

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:39.900
What did she do, what was like a moment when you were like, okay, you're off the chopping block,

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:46.900
or okay, I'm gonna maybe come up or down to your level, but in any case, like, work with you a little bit here,

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:50.900
as opposed to like, when is this bitch gonna help me kind of?

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:54.900
At first, I thought she was kind of too hard on me sometimes, even though again, I think I'm hard on myself,

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:58.900
when other people are hard on me, I'm still like, well, don't do that, you know?

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.900
Well, that's, yeah, I mean...

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:01.900
Don't call me out on things.

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:02.900
That's the thing though.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.900
I mean, Sarah Silverman was the first person to point that out to me,

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:11.900
like, self-loathing, self-loving, like, it's about you, and like, nobody's more defensive than someone at self-loathing.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:17.900
You're like, I'm just a poopy pants, and someone goes like, well, you do have a little bit of poop in your pants,

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.900
and you're like, you're a fucking asshole.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.900
Like, you're all the more outrageous.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:25.900
You're like, I just shot myself, and you're shooting me through the hole?

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.900
Exactly, exactly.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.900
It's outrageous.

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:29.900
I know.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:34.900
Yeah, I think at first I thought maybe she was a little bit too much of a person that was very blunt,

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:41.900
and I don't know, didn't want to like, sugarcoat or whatever, and it's like, I don't know, I like people to be genuine,

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.900
but when it's like a therapist, I don't like if they're like, kind of, hard on me,

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:49.900
and I think she got to a point where she is still like that, and she doesn't sugarcoat things,

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:56.900
but she's learned that I respond to positivity and not negativity, so she's kind of just learned who I am and what I need,

01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.900
and that some people need to be like, they need to have a kick in the butt,

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.900
but then some people need to have a little hope of like, you can do it.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.900
It really depends on the person what's going to actually motivate you.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:14.900
I think my therapist, the threshold for me was when it was finally set out loud,

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:22.900
because when it comes to drinking, everybody else other than me is a square.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:30.900
They don't understand what I understand about drinking my relationship with it,

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:36.900
and I get nervous when squares get into that territory,

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.900
and then I get nervous about getting nervous about getting nervous,

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.900
because squares react to you getting nervous about the subject of you drinking

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:50.900
the way that they've read on the Milton Bradley box for playing talk to an alcoholic

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:54.900
that's just like, denial's the first line, and it's like, yeah, okay, so,

01:03:54.900 --> 01:04:03.900
and then you get nervous about it, and it just took a really long time of cat and mouse with her bringing up my drinking,

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:11.900
where I was on one hand not willing to talk about it with her,

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.900
but on the other hand, not willing to not be willing to talk about it,

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.900
because I didn't want to fuel either of those furnaces,

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:24.900
and then there was just some crucial conversation we had where maybe she finally figured out

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:29.900
that what she needed to do was promise me that she was never going to ask me to stop drinking,

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:32.900
which you would think would be a horrible thing to do,

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:37.900
because you either have to stop or you don't, but because she finally said that,

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:42.900
I've now had so many more conversations about something that's so fundamental to my psychology,

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.900
which was my relationship with self-medication,

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.900
than I ever would have with anybody who, no matter how noble their purpose was,

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.900
was just going to take a position of like, well, let's talk about your drinking,

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:57.900
and she finally, you know, just like a cowboy coming up to a spooked horse, you know,

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:05.900
it's just like the horse needs to know you're not going to throw a saddle on it, which you are.

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:09.900
But, you know, honestly, Dave Kline's not here, is he?

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:14.900
Because otherwise, there would have been seven upes by now.

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.900
But Dave Kline, my physical therapist, if you will,

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:22.900
like the guy that comes and watches me do tummy crunches.

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:26.900
Well, that's a pretty pejorative description of my occupation.

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.900
The guy that makes me do tummy crunches.

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.900
But it's like, early on...

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.900
Was that me again?

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:37.900
Early on, there was a lot of weird...

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:42.900
Because I Instagram live all of it, and there's probably an archive of it where like,

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.900
I was like, so...

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.900
Like, that was like this control freak barrier.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:52.900
Like, I don't want another person being able to come into my home

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:58.900
and just tell me to do more sit-ups if I feel like I've done enough.

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:05.900
It's like, it just, like, it hits this nerve, not laziness.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.900
But something beyond that where it's like,

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.900
I think it goes back to just being afraid on the playground of like,

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.900
guys that were good at football or something like that.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.900
But anyways, like, now that I think about it, it's like the exact same thing.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:23.900
Trust is so powerful and rare.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:26.900
I just got to a point in therapy...

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.900
Remember when I promised you wouldn't be able to talk forever?

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:34.900
I just got to a point in therapy where it's...

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:35.900
It's like, there's so much shit.

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.900
It was like such a sink full of dishes to do that I was so unenthused about.

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:42.900
Like, can we get to this fundamental stuff?

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:45.900
And it's like, no, you can't do that stuff.

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.900
There's fucking macaroni stuck to this tray.

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:49.900
Yes, it's been there forever.

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:54.900
Yes, you don't think it's important, but let's soak this shit and all that blah blah blah.

01:06:54.900 --> 01:07:01.900
And I finally now just started to have conversations with her about the fact that I don't have intimate relationships.

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:09.900
Like, I have lovers and then I have my kind of round table of musketeers.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:15.900
Metaphore mix kind of intentional because it's like, what are we?

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.900
I work with my friends.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.900
There's always, like, it's always a business.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.900
There's always an exit, you know, available.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.900
I don't have these friendships that I see portrayed in movies and television,

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:34.900
let alone described in hallmark cards, but I also don't know if those are real.

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.900
But like, I don't, it's like trust.

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:44.900
Like, I don't want anybody to be able to, like, hurt me.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:50.900
It's very generic sounding stuff, but like, it's so fucking profound to me.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:54.900
Like, I can't just like, Spencer and I were talking about this when we were walking in New York.

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.900
About vulnerability.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:59.900
Yeah, Dan also talks about that a lot on the podcast that comes out next time.

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.900
I think it was a really valuable thing.

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:03.900
Not that this podcast is there for worthless.

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.900
No, this one's better.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.900
I think this was money well spent.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.900
I think it's good you guys drove to a bad neighborhood.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.900
Yeah, thanks so much.

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:16.900
I just, how do you, because Spencer kind of spontaneously offered me while we were walking and talking about it.

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:24.900
He had this like, you know, odd personal visual metaphor for his heart.

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:25.900
Like a mental image.

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:28.900
And he was like, I know it's weird, but I see my heart like this.

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:32.900
And I was like, oh, no, I see my heart in an incredibly specific way too.

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:36.900
Do you have an image in your head of how your heart works?

01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.900
Maybe sometimes I think about it.

01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:40.900
I think more how my brain works.

01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:44.900
But like when people hurt your feelings and stuff.

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:53.900
Like the way, yeah, the, the paths in and out, like if you pictured like your feelings as being like in the center of your chest.

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:59.900
And then like you had to like draw a picture with crayons of like how it works mechanically.

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:04.900
Not pumping blood, but like letting things in and out, like letting feelings, whatever.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:07.900
Is there like an image that comes to mind?

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.900
Minds a spiky clam shell.

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:17.900
Like cloister from Pokemon with a heart in the middle.

01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:20.900
But it used withdrawal already.

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:27.900
In order to give you time to think I will not, not to satisfy my fetish for talking over people.

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:32.900
I will, I will, I will do mine and then you can maybe if you take a whack at yours.

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.900
But I just, it's fun.

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:49.900
It's been a bit of how it like I've always just had this very clear image of this very steampunk iron orb with rivets and like it's just, it's just absolutely proudly defiantly

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.900
sealed off.

01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.900
But powerful.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:10:08.900
And that it can, you know, there's very specific channels coming out of it that go out of that completely out of its vicinity because the power that's coming out of it has no place around it.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.900
That would be really foolish architecture.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:19.900
And so it carries things as far away as possible where they can be used and processed and help other people.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:38.900
And but the real key is that if you're standing near it, there's no fucking way you're going to get anything but burnt or scalded or, or, or, you know, it's like, it's like a point of pride how inaccessible it is because it's like there's this feeling in my head of like that I that I took me all this time to

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.900
reexamine where I'm like, it, that's how it should be.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.900
It should be proud of that.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.900
It's like playing a tower defense game.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.900
Like, like, like, oh, look, my inventory.

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.900
You can't get near it.

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:51.900
You shouldn't be able to.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.900
You'll fuck it up.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:58.900
So all right, now you go better be good.

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:03.900
Well, I think the way that I was like, I was like, oh, I haven't, I haven't thought about my heart visually like that.

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:07.900
But I think the way that you're talking about your heart is I'm just really gay.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:09.900
I'm just really gay.

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.900
Nova.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.900
What the fuck you we're opening ourselves up.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:18.900
No wonder I keep a fucking iron shell around my heart.

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.900
Yeah, homophobic attacks.

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.900
Sorry, go ahead.

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:32.900
I think the way you're just you're thinking of your heart is maybe I've thought about my brain, but it's like maybe I feel the same way about it.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:35.900
When I think about who I am and my emotions and how I can be hurt.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:41.900
I'm not picturing my brain, but I think I think I probably think about it and I don't know.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:49.900
I got really into I got really into inside out when I came out and when it came out and not when I came out.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:56.900
Just in the thought of like, there's the five emotions, you know, and then they have these essences and don't forget those memory islands.

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:57.900
God damn it.

01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.900
That story has problems.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.900
Sorry, I don't mean to derail you.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.900
Don't get mad.

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.900
Don't get mad.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.900
It made me cry, too.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.900
I also cried during the movie.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:13.900
I'm not stomping on your garden and going, there's nothing of value here.

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:15.900
No, yeah.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:20.900
Well, because it's also like a real psychology concept of there being like five emotions and stuff.

01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:25.900
And I think I think of myself as a very emotional being and a person of sort of moods and flavors and whatnot.

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:33.900
That sounds stupid, but I think maybe if I were to picture like my heart, it would be sort of a swirling essence of different colors and maybe sort of like smoke.

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:34.900
I don't know.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:35.900
Like I've thought about like aura.

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:42.900
I've been told by like more than one person, like that my aura is purple, which is, I mean, that's like two people.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.900
So it's not like, oh, that's the craziest coincidence ever.

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:46.900
Like it must be real, but.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.900
No, it's purple.

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.900
Damn.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.900
Jeff, do you see auras?

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:54.900
No.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.900
I believe that.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:56.900
It's psychic.

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:57.900
Just nervous.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.900
Is it purple a good one?

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.900
I guess there's not a lot of bad aura.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:06.900
They describe the people who've told me out of purple auras that it's like sort of cosmic.

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:14.900
It's like kind of different out there and like, I don't know, loving or bright or something, which is sounds really, really narcissistic coming from my own self.

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.900
But yeah, I don't know.

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.900
I think I would think of it as just sort of a thing of feelings and different things.

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:20.900
And I don't know.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:25.900
I kind of match things up in my head of sort of like, oh, these things all have the same essence or the same vibe.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.900
And that's just sort of the way I think about things more than like concrete things.

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.900
That sounds healthier.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.900
Less practical, but that's okay.

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:37.900
I think it's interesting that things get more complicated when you get up to your brain.

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:44.900
And the reason I will Dan explain that I find that interesting is because I don't feel that way at all.

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:53.900
It's like the brain for me is like, get up there like where you can just run your fucking mouth and for better or for worse, it'll all come out and wash and all this stuff.

01:13:53.900 --> 01:14:00.900
However, and I know you don't want to be, you know, laser focused on as a representative of anything or whatever.

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:12.900
But the thing that makes you different from me is that at some point in your life you started to feel conflicted about identity in a way that is absolutely incompatible with like neurotypical mainstream society.

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:22.900
Whereas I never had to think about myself as anything but a fucking cool rebel, even though I was just like, because I never woke up going,

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:34.900
there's a thought in here that according to that Miller light billboard is criminal or like cruising for a bruising or maybe I shouldn't have.

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.900
Maybe I need to just get through it and all this stuff.

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:50.900
And so it's like, it's, it's, it's terrifying for me to think about the brain, which for me is like, get up to your strong corner, get away from your heart as like the place that is actually needs to be towered,

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:52.900
and organized and.

01:14:52.900 --> 01:15:07.900
Yeah, well, I think that that maybe come from sort of that might come from sort of like how well because like, I mean, that's kind of why things have been so weird for me lately is because it was only like a couple months ago,

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:13.900
like probably less than six months ago or around that when I got diagnosed with autism by my therapist.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:21.900
And because she'd, she hadn't said anything, but I think she knew about it kind of like with your therapist where it's like she finally felt okay, bring up the drinking one day I came in and I was like,

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:22.900
okay, come on.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:33.900
Ever since I was as long as I can form memories, I can remember people being like, oh, you're kind of different or knowing that I'm kind of different or just being kind of different and all these stupid tiny little ways,

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:40.900
you know, that I'm like, okay, but like nobody else I know is thinking that way, even if it seems like a small thing.

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.900
Like it's just sort of like this thing that is all of me.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.900
It's not like one particular thing about me.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:57.900
So then when she said that and I kind of absorbed it and everything was like, okay, because yes, like you said, I guess what would be different about us is that as long as I can remember,

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:08.900
I've thought about like who I am and like how I'm different from other people and I don't know how I'm the same and stuff and yeah, I've always been kind of analyzing like who I am and what I am.

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:18.900
And I've never been able to kind of bring any sort of practicality to that of like a lot of kids like act different to avoid being bullied.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:23.900
I mean, I wasn't bullied too bad, but it never even occurred to me that I could try being different.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.900
Like I was like, well, okay, this is it.

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:32.900
Then I get bullied then or this is how I try to make them stop the bullying, but it never occurred to me to ever be anything other than what I am.

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:38.900
And now that I'm like 20 and thinking about trying to maybe get a job and stuff.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:48.900
I'm thinking like, oh, well, do I have to enter into a world where I'm not going to be able to be me and I'm going to have to do practical things or something and I don't know.

01:16:48.900 --> 01:17:14.900
I think that's like the one thing I love about the autistic community is that like humanity itself in a really magnified way, precisely because there is a deprivation of objective truth that comes more easy to typical people that or in the case of if you look at humanity

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.900
and it's like easy for a skunk to know if it's doing what it should be doing.

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.900
It's easy for a giraffe.

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:22.900
Fucking giraffes.

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:26.900
No, shout out to giraffes who are like dying in Griffith Park Zoo right now.

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:30.900
Let's not be mean.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:31.900
I don't think it's a zoo anymore.

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:32.900
Sharks are great.

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.900
Whatever.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.900
Don't derail me.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:35.900
I'm on a fucking roll.

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:36.900
Can't you hear this?

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:55.900
But as we talked to our friend Steve Silverman who wrote Neurotribes that within humanity that people who have autistic traits also are like, they're like, well, wait, what am I?

01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:10.900
I don't have this sort of like compulsion for these sort of like easy truths or whatever. But because of that, even as uncomfortable as it feels, this is dance-plating autism, dance-plating everything to you.

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:14.900
But this is just, I just find this to be a very romantic and wonderful concept.

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:30.900
Because of that, there's an increased attention on it. There may not be what feels like facile awareness, and that can feel so alienating and so sad that it's like, it's that Pinocchio syndrome thing, which, you know, autistic people, it looks like they hate and television stuff.

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:34.900
They hate like neurotypicals going like, oh, bleep, bloop, just wants to be human.

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:45.900
But at the same time, at the core of that is this idea of I am separate, so like you wake up the same as everything and don't even have to make a choice.

01:18:45.900 --> 01:19:02.900
Here I am wondering who the fuck I am. Those people have this power to examine the things that other people take for granted and go, you know, then that's why I think this tradition of like creatives and artists and things.

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:10.900
I'm going to make Calvin and Hobbes because I don't know what the fuck it means to be this or that. I don't mean to diagnose that guy, but anyways.

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.900
Well, I think I haven't really heard that specific take on autism, which is really interesting.

01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.900
I fucking coined it.

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:31.900
But I've heard that a lot about being trans, because gender is so deeply ingrained in our society and from the smallest to the biggest ways that if you think I'm not that, what everything seems to be, it's like, oh, I feel like I'm starting from scratch.

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:35.900
I feel like I'm starting from scratch or something and all these personality traits.

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:42.900
I have to like, yeah, you examine things more and you don't like feel like you can fall into easily defined things.

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:53.900
Yeah, thank God for people going like finally like, hey, you know what, there actually is such a thing as somebody that doesn't even can't doesn't know like you want to play some duck duck goose game.

01:19:53.900 --> 01:20:15.900
Maybe duck, maybe goose, maybe both. I'd like, like, why don't we ask that? Like, and of course you're going to get those tomatoes thrown at you. But like, it is such a, it's like, it makes every single person at every bachelorette party, every construction site, these archetypes we conjure of the most binary committed people,

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:35.900
my, myself included, like, after all the reaction of like, well, what's next? Come on. Then, then thought has to happen just for the fuck of it, even, you know, I can start as like, what you think is punching down curiosity is like, all right, well, let me get this straight.

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:55.900
Those roads can at least lead to inspection, because I think it's such an important thing for that reason. It's like a skeleton key to all this other shit, because also as I've said, like, and I don't know if this is offensive to people, but, but I'll learn that it is for for the reason I learned it

01:20:55.900 --> 01:21:09.900
but I've always thought in the back of my head, you know, there's never going to be a million trans movement, literally, just, it's never going to be, it's never going to be this thing that we're used to, which is like, numbers, numbers, numbers.

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:27.900
And good, because we've entered a world where that numbers are not what are making things change, sometimes catastrophically, it can take one troll and 20 bots to fuck up an entire thing that actually is a pillar of society or whatever.

01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:52.900
We need to actually graduate beyond the populist idea of democracy where it's like, well, if you're a million people, you're less important to two million people and get into like, okay, we got to make sure we have to have an acid test and it can come down to one individual, which is more, you know, I think, I think it's not only more liberal,

01:21:52.900 --> 01:22:07.900
it's also, I think that it's more practical in terms of becoming a planet of eight billion people that are all connected telepathically and trying to get the fuck off of burning cinder that they've eaten all the giraffes off of.

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:28.900
We're going to have to have a fundamental respect for humans and we're not going to be able to continue to have curveballs, you know, like we can't, the shot clock is so near zero, we cannot continue to go, okay, it's okay that you're black, but now let's get back to work.

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:42.900
What, you're a woman, that's, get out of here, like we got to stop being so thrown by people saying, I over here, table five needs bread.

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:54.900
We can't keep going like close the restaurant, fuck you, why are you eating here, what's food, should we make it illegal, we have to just get to a place where we're like, table five needs bread, got it, it's a terrible metaphor.

01:22:54.900 --> 01:23:20.900
I think I get it though, yeah, I think it's pretty insane, although also just knowing about the nature of humans or something, like I think, I mean, like it makes sense logically, but if you think, like if I really think about it, it just, it makes, it's so insane to me like the rules we've created and how many rules are created.

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:40.900
We think of like, oh, the fifties were insane, you know, you had to have your fork on the right, that's crazy, I'll have my fork on the left, but it's like we're still have so many deeply ingrained things that go way beyond where you put your fork, like what a harmless, you know, rule to have in your society, but there's deeper ones that are harmful or not harmful.

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:41.900
Like racism.

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:43.900
Yeah, but there's also like little things.

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:44.900
Just to name a few.

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:55.900
Yeah, there's, there's things that are really, really big and really bad like that, but there's also like little things that it's weird that it's a rule, but on such a large scale.

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:56.900
I don't know.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:01.900
Yeah, you get indoctrinated into shit and everybody wants to be a good person pretty much.

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:14.900
And you go like, okay, now if I put my fork on the wrong side, I'm called an anti hero, I'm called a, an upstart, I'm called a kind of like cool person.

01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:18.900
And but it's like, that can be taught to you as a child.

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:31.900
And then that person precisely because in reference back to me getting offended with in the midst of, in the midst of myself deprecation, somebody suggests that I'm a bad person, I get mad at them and abuse them.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:44.900
That is the problem with kind of like institutionalized liberalism, for instance, where you go, hey, I'm a liberal, I voted for this, I understand that racism is bad.

01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:52.900
Here's how racism is defined, here's whether I'm sexist, here's whether I've ever sexually harassed anyone, here's whether I'm an advocate of this community or that.

01:24:52.900 --> 01:25:00.900
And don't, and then someone says, hey man, what you did there was a little disrespectful and you bite their fucking head off because what am I a Nazi?

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.900
How dare you and all that stuff.

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:06.900
And I think that it's that illustrates this wall that you're talking about.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:17.900
And instead of this process that we've, it has been fine because it's moved at a speed faster than the average caveman, which is like, build the wall here.

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.900
Okay, wall needs to be torn down.

01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.900
We're going to move it 20 feet out, everybody.

01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:22.900
Okay, all right.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:23.900
Grumble, grumble.

01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:26.900
Now it's harder to get to work, grumble, grumble, but nothing collapses.

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.900
We're hitting this tipping point now where the walls are digital, and so is the road to work.

01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:33.900
And so is the path to democracy.

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:47.900
So is the, and it's like, holy shit, if we can't get it through our head, that just in general, take it, take it as it comes and don't allow yourself to be fucking thrown by other people.

01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:57.900
We're, if we don't, if we don't upgrade that firmware to where we don't have to have a fucking forum, I'm repeating myself, like we're going to, we're going to die.

01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:02.900
Anyways, in the news today, we probably are already dying.

01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:03.900
Yeah.

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:06.900
You were prompted to raise your, you were compelled to raise your hand.

01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:07.900
For a while now.

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:08.900
I just had a question.

01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:13.900
Has your therapist ever asked you if you want to be depressed?

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:20.900
The question was, has my therapist, has any, has we both answered it?

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:23.900
Has your therapist ever asked you if you want to be depressed?

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:27.900
No, she never has, but I've asked, I've always wondered that.

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:29.900
Ask her if she can ask you that.

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.900
That could be fun.

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:38.900
Well, you've talked about how you are like really comfortable with being unhappy, you know, or comfortable being depressed or being alcoholic or something.

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:39.900
Right.

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:44.900
So I got, yeah, actually, I hadn't put it in that context, but in that sense, very much so.

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:47.900
She's definitely like lowered that challenge or rather warning.

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:56.900
Sounds like you're getting really close to happiness and like you, like coping with it can bring out all kinds of shit.

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:57.900
Yeah.

01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:58.900
Like I think I self sabotage.

01:26:58.900 --> 01:26:59.900
I'm terrified of success.

01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:06.900
I've tried like eating and exercising for years and years and years, but I always have this thought of like, what if everything gets better than what the fuck will I do?

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:15.900
It's been such a huge, huge challenge for me this last year because traditionally what I do is, oh, look, he made that thing.

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:16.900
Oh, everyone's happy.

01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:20.900
Oh, they just, Annie and Jeff to get together or maybe he's going to kiss Britta.

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:21.900
You have a fandom.

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:22.900
You have people on Tumblr.

01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:23.900
They like your show.

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:24.900
You're doing good.

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:25.900
You did it.

01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:26.900
You did it.

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:27.900
You fucking monkey.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:28.900
You did it.

01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:29.900
Boom.

01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:30.900
What's he doing?

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:36.900
I'm like getting mad at Sony and like driving home in tears because my show is so important and how can they understand it?

01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:40.900
It's like, you look back on that and I go like self sabotage.

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:41.900
It has to be.

01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:45.900
There was never enough of a threat that I ever had to go to Def Con this or that.

01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:49.900
However, I still, I'm like, fuck people who say pick your battles and all that stuff.

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:59.900
And this last year has been therefore like this thing where it's like, okay, you did it.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:05.900
You made a successful show by all the metrics that you used to abide by.

01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:13.900
Also, in addition to that, you're going to get recognized and rewarded for it to the point where you might die happy or whatever that fucking goal is.

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:20.900
And all of a sudden it seems like you're actually being targeted unfairly.

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:32.900
However, if you talk about it, it could cause enough of a shit storm to get you fired.

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:35.900
It would be feeding the trolls.

01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:39.900
And it's like, oh, wait, where does the self sabotage end?

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:45.900
Does it end when you stop talking about the things that upset you?

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:48.900
Because my mouth gets me fired a lot.

01:28:48.900 --> 01:29:05.900
And so one would reason if they were trying to destroy my life that it would be as easy as lobbing a dead cat into a part of the courtyard where I was bound to put on a show about it and spread disease and take my whole kingdom down.

01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:12.900
And so then you get into, oh, now I'm doing things because it's what the enemy doesn't want.

01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:16.900
I'm like, when did I become a fucking liar for a living?

01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:20.900
When did I wake up every day and go, first of all, what do you think?

01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:22.900
Okay, now what do you say?

01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:24.900
And have those two things be separate?

01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:25.900
It's miserable.

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:29.900
It's not as miserable as anybody listening.

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:30.900
Everyone has those problems.

01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:45.900
But that's why it's been a weird year because I'm like, wait, you can beat the people that want to destroy you by never paying any attention to it.

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:53.900
And it feels like going like this while people kick you, which I've never done.

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:56.900
But then again, I've never been a huge counterpuncher.

01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:58.900
I'm not like a fucking warrior.

01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:01.900
I don't go like, nobody fucks with me.

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:08.900
What I do is every week I go, well, this happened today.

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.900
Someone wrote this about me.

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:11.900
Someone said this.

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:12.900
This is how that felt.

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:16.900
And then no matter what, every day I go home, I'm like, every week, at least I recalibrate.

01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:20.900
And I go, well, I don't have anything bouncing around in my head anymore.

01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:28.900
But as I keep referencing, we're a year now going into this, I'm like, what am I a fucking senator?

01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:40.900
Where I'm like, it's like the smart thing for me to do to be polite or comported.

01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:42.900
Is that what enemies want?

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.900
Do we live by what enemies?

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:52.900
But my therapist finally got there, and I did say this in New York, so I'll be repeating it.

01:30:52.900 --> 01:31:06.900
But she finally said, so you are a 45-year-old man who has been able to say, I don't care forever.

01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:08.900
And now you care.

01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:11.900
And that's difficult.

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:22.900
And it sounds really, it's a really, really unfortunate thing that the messengers of that have to be trolls, Nazis.

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.900
And she didn't have to finish her thought, because then I got it.

01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:25.900
I was like, oh, yeah.

01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:39.900
So in other words, if it weren't these stupid stories and these stupid times, like, it would be time for me to graduate from deliberately disaffected.

01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:41.900
I don't care about nothing.

01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:42.900
You can't get near me.

01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:46.900
It's a wonder I was married for eight months.

01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:49.900
It's like, too, holy shit, I love someone.

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:51.900
Holy shit, I'm proud of my job.

01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:55.900
Holy shit, I don't want to get fired.

01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:57.900
Holy shit, I don't want to hurt people.

01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:03.900
Holy shit, there are people out there that you can hurt by doing nothing.

01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:08.900
Holy shit, there are people out there that I've hurt when I thought I was the victim.

01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:11.900
Because they didn't like me enough.

01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:16.900
Holy shit, I am part of the problem even by not being part of the problem.

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:26.900
And holy shit, there are people who are lying in way, drooling for any sign of vulnerability so they can jump on me.

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:33.900
And any nutsack sticking out, they will grab and twist and try to rip off because they don't even believe I'm real.

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:38.900
And it's like, welcome to the party, which is not even...

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:43.900
It's like, let alone being famous, it's like, I think that's everyone over the age of 30.

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:52.900
Everybody has to go to a job where they have to fucking, you know, they have to worry about, you know, like, oh, my happiness is...

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.900
But that's the negative way of putting it.

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:59.900
Everyone in adulthood starts to realize what they love and what they like.

01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:04.900
And then the crucial key is, don't worry about whether or not to be vulnerable.

01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.900
Be honest, keep being honest.

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:14.900
Because if you're honest and you say, here's a nut sack, it's on my knee, and someone runs up and kicks it.

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:16.900
Okay, ouch.

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:25.900
But you can't just rearrange and go like, my knee's bulletproof.

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.900
Because that's what nutsacks are.

01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:29.900
They're bulletproof.

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:31.900
And it's like...

01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:38.900
I want you to extend this metaphor as long as you can.

01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:41.900
Well, it's like in Red Dead Redemption.

01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:43.900
But I really think...

01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:55.900
So talking to this youngster here, I'm saying, like, you know, like, whatever's going on with you, you know, like...

01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:58.900
It seems like you've got good parents because you're not...

01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:04.900
It doesn't sound like you're a product of abuse or alienation on the home front.

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:07.900
You have a dad that's dropping you off and picking you up here.

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:14.900
And that could be a higher challenge because you don't have anybody to blame but yourself.

01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:17.900
And then you don't know what that's supposed to mean and all that stuff.

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:32.900
So what you've got to do to maintain your sanity, I think, is connect and share and understand that you will be assailed and hurt.

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:36.900
But that pain isn't real.

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:39.900
It's real. It's a real feeling, but it's not real destruction.

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:46.900
Because the only real destruction is if a tentacle goes out and someone kicks it and it hurts so you recoil,

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:52.900
which is what we all do in response to trauma, then that's the actual physical effect of the kick,

01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:54.900
is that there's no more tentacle there anymore.

01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.900
That's a place where there's no more connection.

01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:01.900
But the pain of the kick didn't actually damage the tentacle.

01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:04.900
It's a dumb metaphor because, of course, if you kick a tentacle, you're going to damage it.

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:11.900
No, it's fine. It's like when you touch a snail's eye, it pops right back out.

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:18.900
What's up, Raise Handy? Our new character, Handy Raise.

01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:22.900
Yeah, why don't you come up and grab a mic and what's that?

01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:26.900
It's someone's birthday.

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:31.900
I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at our world.

01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:32.900
Come on up, birthday.

01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:34.900
Thank you so much.

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:37.900
Three people again?

01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:41.900
I'm suddenly a fan of my podcast because I just like that idea.

01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:45.900
He's like this, and then another person goes, just bring him up.

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:48.900
And then the woman goes, it's my birthday.

01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.900
I like all of that for all reasons.

01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:53.900
I didn't mean to start anything. I just had a follow-up question.

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.900
Yeah, well, yeah, I don't think we're...

01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:57.900
What day's your birthday again?

01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.900
11-11. It was yesterday.

01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:00.900
Happy birthday.

01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:01.900
Thanks.

01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:02.900
What's your name?

01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:03.900
Caroline.

01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:04.900
Hi.

01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:05.900
Hi, Caroline.

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:07.900
Nice to meet you.

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:08.900
What's your name?

01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:09.900
Nova.

01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:10.900
Nice to meet you.

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:11.900
Dan, right.

01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:13.900
Thank you very much.

01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:15.900
A birthday water?

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:16.900
Oh, yeah.

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.900
A birthday water.

01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:20.900
Oh, yeah, I could use a Coke.

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:23.900
I could use a Coke.

01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:25.900
Can of Coke.

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:29.900
Turkey, mayo, lettuce, tomato, lightly toast.

01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:30.900
A joke.

01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:31.900
Okay, Aisa, what was your follow-up?

01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:35.900
My follow-up question was how do you then...

01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.900
You answered my former question of do you think that you want to be depressed?

01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:45.900
But my follow-up was how then do you distinguish between your maladaptive behavior

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:48.900
versus behavior that is healthy but then is punished?

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.900
You're talking about being honest and being upfront with people

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.900
in big platforms like this, which seems healthy,

01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:56.900
but then you've learned to recoil from that.

01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:00.900
So how do you distinctify between maladaptive behaviors versus...

01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:05.900
My theory as of the last couple of weeks that made me so relieved

01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:12.900
because it makes me comfortable again is that the answer is whether or not it's true.

01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:17.900
Because that was for so long my definition of...

01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:19.900
I rubbed a mannequin leg on my nipple.

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.900
I have a nylon fetish.

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:23.900
I put a thing in my butt.

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:29.900
It's like there's no such thing as truth that should hurt you.

01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.900
There's technically one...

01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:34.900
If you were, for instance, a pedophile,

01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:38.900
we have this go-to crime where we go,

01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:44.900
because aside from just regular rape of a non-consensual person,

01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:48.900
it's like the word pedophile is the only thing worse than anything sexually,

01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:54.900
in addition to being worse than a Nazi, or so we feel emotionally.

01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:59.900
And so if you weren't that,

01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:03.900
then theoretically anything that you were,

01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:08.900
anything that you could say out loud in this country,

01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:15.900
it should not be anything that would automatically cause destruction to your life.

01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:17.900
It could cause embarrassment,

01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:21.900
but it shouldn't cause you actual loss of property.

01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:24.900
Well, that's really interesting, because sometimes I'll get into a space

01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:27.900
where I'm feeling bad about myself and then I'll ask my therapist,

01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:32.900
do you think it's okay if I start playing this video game because I like it and stuff?

01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:36.900
I just feel really guilty about doing things that I enjoy.

01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.900
And one time I was just like,

01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:42.900
can I just, like, facing adulthood,

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:45.900
you're like, wow, you can really do anything, mostly.

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.900
I was like, can I just do anything I want?

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:51.900
And she said, yes, well, you can, because I know that you're not going to do anything

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.900
that's going to destroy your life or someone else's.

01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:56.900
Well, she knew you were a hero and an addict,

01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:59.900
and you needed there for it.

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.900
But yeah, my therapist always said right away,

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:05.900
if it's free and fun, do it.

01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:08.900
Yeah, if you're not hurting anybody or yourself is what mine says, yeah.

01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:12.900
Yeah, and so that is the answer to Ace's question,

01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:15.900
which is like, I have the luxury,

01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:18.900
my heart goes out to people who aren't in these shoes,

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:22.900
hence the episode where I went to bat for a bit of violence.

01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:26.900
It was like 100 episodes ago where I'd seen that Pervert Park documentary,

01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:28.900
and I was like, God damn it, that must suck,

01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:31.900
because I can't control my sexuality.

01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:35.900
So what if you couldn't and your sexuality was literally illegal

01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:38.900
and literally involved hurting people?

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:44.900
Shouldn't we spare a thought for treatment and whatnot to break the cycle?

01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:53.900
But I have the luxury of, like, as bad as it gets is what you see,

01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:56.900
which is like, I just fascinated with myself,

01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:00.900
and I like toes on my nipple, and I like girls in pantyhose,

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:05.900
and I like everything that I've talked about for 300 episodes of this podcast,

01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:08.900
which means I have that privilege of,

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:13.900
if I just dump everything from my brain out of my mouth,

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:17.900
then along the way, the worst I can do is use the wrong pronoun,

01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:21.900
say the n-word, these sort of like, kind of like verbal gaffes that could be...

01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:22.900
Social contracts?

01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:26.900
But you'd have to be, you'd have to desire to destroy me

01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:31.900
to then take those mistakes and go,

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.900
therefore we should destroy this person, you know?

01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:41.900
Like, and that I think is the reality that we have to cope with,

01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:46.900
which is if somebody wants to hurt you,

01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:51.900
there's no way to beat them in the game of I'm hurtable,

01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:56.900
and it's not a victory to be unhurtable.

01:40:56.900 --> 01:41:00.900
It's not a victory to have a shield around you

01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:04.900
and turrets that keep people from coming near your front lawn.

01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:10.900
That is not a way to die laughing at everybody

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:14.900
saying, I had the perfect life, you will die with a vague feeling,

01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:19.900
probably of deep unease and sadness.

01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:23.900
Because when my therapist said that,

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:26.900
she was like, she would be the last person that I would think,

01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:29.900
after everything that she's heard,

01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:33.900
to recommend that I continue to do this podcast.

01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:37.900
I would never have thought.

01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:40.900
I would think that she would have been like, yeah,

01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:42.900
that seems like an unhealthy fixation you have on yourself,

01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:45.900
and maybe now that you're growing you should retire the microphone

01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:49.900
and go live in a normal person, it's time.

01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:55.900
But she was like, you need to be honest.

01:41:55.900 --> 01:42:00.900
And the more honest you are, the stronger you feel and are,

01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:07.900
and the more helpful you are.

01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:10.900
I've answered your question 90 times.

01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:12.900
That's the path.

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:15.900
It's maladaptive, healthy, unhealthy, who knows.

01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:17.900
I've been up here and being defensive about it.

01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:20.900
I was up here for more episodes than not saying,

01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:22.900
I hate therapy, I don't believe in therapy.

01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:24.900
I've been up here saying, don't vote, your vote doesn't matter.

01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:26.900
Then I've been up here saying, we should run out in the street

01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:29.900
and kill Nazis.

01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:33.900
Really, who cares, quote, unquote,

01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:38.900
whether the behaviors and thoughts are healthy, unhealthy,

01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:43.900
or leading down the yellow brick road or a dirt path

01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:45.900
that makes Dorothy a cyborg.

01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:49.900
However, which arguably sounds like a cooler story

01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:53.900
than one where it turns out you could go home at any time

01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:55.900
and the bad guy can get killed with water.

01:42:55.900 --> 01:43:01.900
But what's important is for me, maybe not for other people,

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:07.900
but for me, it's vital that I got to be saying what I'm thinking,

01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:10.900
or I'll put a gun in my mouth.

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:13.900
That's why I'm so...

01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:15.900
That's why I'm so...

01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:18.900
Traditionally, I've been so adamant about...

01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:20.900
Every time we mention suicide in the show,

01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:25.900
you notice I always have this kids talk to somebody, et cetera,

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:32.900
because before I started this seemingly self-destructive practice

01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:36.900
of speaking into a microphone about everything that's going on with me,

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:40.900
a behavior that has gotten me fired more than it's gotten me hired,

01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:44.900
a behavior that at times seems like you just wish it would stop

01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:49.900
because if he would just stop doing it, then everything would be fine.

01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:54.900
Shut up, Dan, but for me, maybe not for other people,

01:43:54.900 --> 01:44:02.900
it's like these thoughts in your skull,

01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:06.900
they bounce off every interior surface,

01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:12.900
and every time they do, they accrue thoughts about them,

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:17.900
and they just get so big, so fast.

01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:20.900
And then as soon as they come out of your mouth,

01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:23.900
it doesn't matter if people applaud, it doesn't matter if people boo,

01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:25.900
it doesn't matter if they ignore it,

01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:29.900
the important thing that happens is it came out,

01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:31.900
and now it's gone.

01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:33.900
I've found that over and over again.

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:35.900
It's just like, boom.

01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:43.900
It's like, I said, I stuck a Sharpie pen up my ass once

01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:46.900
because I wanted to see if it would make me come harder,

01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:51.900
and for the rest of my life, that Sharpie pen has no power over me,

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:54.900
it doesn't matter if the audience went,

01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:57.900
yay, let's go buy stock and Sharpie,

01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:00.900
it doesn't matter if they say, you're so brave,

01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:04.900
it doesn't matter, it's like, what matters is that I didn't die.

01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:08.900
It's kind of like, I mean, so I had sex with my third grade teacher,

01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:12.900
to get an A, and I too was homeschooled, so it was really...

01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:14.900
Damn.

01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:17.900
Is that a genuine story from your life?

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:18.900
Yeah, her mom.

01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:19.900
Kind of?

01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:22.900
No, I'm joking.

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:24.900
What you're talking about?

01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:31.900
Well, it's your birthday, you're allowed to run through the fields of incest.

01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:32.900
I just want to say something.

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:35.900
I just want to say something memorable.

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:39.900
What you're talking about is exactly what I've been working on in therapy,

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.900
which is why I was so curious,

01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:44.900
something that my therapist told me recently,

01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:46.900
that was actually one of those big revelation moments,

01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:49.900
was that you're not always trying to fix yourself,

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:53.900
sometimes you're just trying to learn to be okay.

01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:54.900
Right.

01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:57.900
In therapy, at least I'm always trying to be like,

01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:59.900
so I feel this way about this,

01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:01.900
and I think sort of like you were talking about earlier, Nova,

01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:03.900
I feel this way about this, and I think it's because of this,

01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:05.900
and I think if I thought about it this way,

01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.900
then everything would be fine,

01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.900
but sometimes it's like, no, no, no,

01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:13.900
it's okay to just think something that's maybe not great, you know?

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:14.900
You don't have to accept things,

01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:16.900
you don't have to like things to accept them.

01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:17.900
Yeah.

01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:19.900
And there's a thing I've read in some of these books,

01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:20.900
whether it's like, what's his name,

01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:22.900
I can't even fucking sell like men or something like that.

01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:23.900
He was like this guy,

01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:25.900
it's like this sort of, this happiness thing.

01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:30.900
It's a nuanced, this idea of, we'll get,

01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:35.900
if you're worried about going to Thanksgiving

01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:40.900
because you hate, you're uncomfortable talking to your uncle.

01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:41.900
I know I'm going to,

01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:44.900
this is going to be an awful metaphor that doesn't land the point,

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:45.900
but here I go.

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.900
But I'm like, you're on your way to this,

01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:52.900
you're invited to a party that makes you nervous for some reason,

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:54.900
let's say, you're uncomfortable.

01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:59.900
We think that the day that you realize

01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:03.900
you don't want to go to the party because your uncle's racist,

01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:10.900
or that, even though that thought doesn't make you happy,

01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:15.900
we believe, we don't think that you're following your comfort

01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:19.900
because what's comfortable about the thought that your uncle's racist, right?

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:24.900
Or that you're a fuck-up that'll just get lost on the way to the party.

01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:31.900
We say negative shit to ourselves that actually causes a dopamine spike

01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:37.900
and causes us to, it gives us a little fire escape out of a zone of discomfort.

01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:41.900
Pretending that we understand something for the sake of not thinking about it.

01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:43.900
Exactly, yeah.

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:46.900
No one likes to be uncertain,

01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:51.900
and yet, actually, uncertainty is a huge invitation

01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:55.900
to a really beneficial burning man

01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:59.900
where weird ideas can happen while you have no idea what the fuck you think.

01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:02.900
But it feels like pain to us, it actually feels criminal to us,

01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:05.900
and then you go, you know what, fuck that guy, I'm not going to his party,

01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:09.900
and even though it creates this negative thing in your life,

01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:14.900
you're happy, you made yourself happy.

01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:16.900
I thought I saw a hand or something out there,

01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:19.900
but it's probably just people going, Jesus Christ, how long is this show?

01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:22.900
It's probably just four people looking at their watches in unison.

01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:25.900
I'm having a great time.

01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:28.900
This is a dream come true.

01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:30.900
We should be fair.

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:33.900
Asa was out front handing out his flyers for Asanomics.

01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:35.900
It's a new religion.

01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:37.900
Everybody gets $5 and that's it.

01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:39.900
His name's not even Asa.

01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:44.900
It stands for assertiveness, spirit, and more assertiveness.

01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:48.900
Or angle, side angle, any of those acronyms.

01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:52.900
I was just going to say what you were saying about honesty and everything.

01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:55.900
Like I said when I was a kid, I could never not be myself,

01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:59.900
but I think now I've felt pressure to maybe kind of change

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.900
or to pull these certain thoughts,

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:05.900
and I think maybe that's kind of making me really sick inside.

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:09.900
Like lately, and I've always been just a really fully authentic person

01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:11.900
regardless of what happens.

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:14.900
What happens will happen, you know,

01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:16.900
and otherwise you'll just make yourself sick.

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:19.900
Yeah, I mean, this is going to sound cornball,

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:21.900
like I'm like Geraldo and I'm like capitalizing,

01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:23.900
I don't want to get points for it,

01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:25.900
I'm like I can't protect you from anybody.

01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:28.900
I can't protect myself from myself or anybody else,

01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:30.900
but I will, I can guarantee you this,

01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:33.900
and maybe what's important is that we all guarantee this to each other.

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:36.900
Any chance we get is that you can't say anything to me

01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:42.900
that's going to make me suddenly start to realize you're a bad person.

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:44.900
Except lies.

01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:47.900
Like if I find out that you said one thing

01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:50.900
and then I find out you're capable of dishonesty,

01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:53.900
because that makes you dangerous because,

01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:56.900
but I can forgive you if you then later tell me,

01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:59.900
I lied to you about this and that,

01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:03.900
but if you tell me the truth,

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:06.900
I am never going to punish you for it.

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:08.900
I'm never going to like,

01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:11.900
unless it's an accident, unless you go like,

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.900
can I tell you something?

01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:15.900
I put peanut butter on my pussy the other day,

01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:17.900
and I might accidentally go,

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:20.900
that's fucking nuts, and you burst into tears and go,

01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:23.900
the word nuts is what they said to me when I'm like,

01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:25.900
that shit could happen.

01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:27.900
I could step on your foot while we're dancing,

01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:31.900
but I am never, I'm never going to go,

01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:34.900
well, you shouldn't be danced with,

01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:36.900
you don't belong on this dance floor,

01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:38.900
you should, you know, and so,

01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:41.900
like if nowhere else other than your therapist's office,

01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:44.900
you know, please consider this an actual definition,

01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:47.900
not a political definition of a safe place.

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:49.900
It's not, nowhere is safe,

01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:54.900
but you're safe from us up here for sure.

01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:56.900
Across the threshold,

01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:59.900
blurt semi-fictional shit

01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:01.900
that you haven't even explored yet.

01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:05.900
If you want to, you run the risk of people in the reddit going,

01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:11.900
but not us, we will hold you on our shoulders

01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:15.900
because, what can we accomplish with this podcast

01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:19.900
if not corrupting a new generation?

01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:21.900
Celebrating honesty.

01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:23.900
And I guess that invitation goes for you too, Asa,

01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:25.900
but I don't know if I trust you yet.

01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:27.900
What can I do to earn your trust?

01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:29.900
Well, I have a suspender thing,

01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.900
because I'm like, what's wrong with a belt?

01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:33.900
No suspenders are more convenient.

01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:35.900
I'm an advocate.

01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:37.900
Thank you, I appreciate that.

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:40.900
No, I'm kidding, it's probably a bad joke.

01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.900
Because my whole point is we have to trust each other.

01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:44.900
I trust you.

01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:46.900
Caroline?

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:47.900
Yeah.

01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:49.900
Happy birthday.

01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:50.900
Thanks.

01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:52.900
Unless it turns out to not really be your birthday, I trust you.

01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:53.900
Oh, it's my birthday.

01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:55.900
It was yesterday.

01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:57.900
Yeah, it was yesterday.

01:51:57.900 --> 01:51:58.900
So it's not really your birthday?

01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:00.900
It's not, but I wanted to get on stage.

01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:03.900
This trust thing is getting off to a shit start.

01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:05.900
But she told us it was yesterday.

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:07.900
She wasn't like, no, yeah, it's my birthday.

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:09.900
You know what we should do in the show?

01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:12.900
I think because I think, you know,

01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:14.900
like sometimes this makes us uncomfortable

01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:16.900
because the show attracts a certain mind

01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:20.900
that's going to be averse to things that feel like a revival tent

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:24.900
because that evokes thoughts of religion and dishonesty.

01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:27.900
But it's a town meeting, this podcast,

01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:31.900
and we should have a moment in the show where we go,

01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:33.900
like we used to.

01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:35.900
Hey, anybody got something so pressing

01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:37.900
that they really want to talk about it?

01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:40.900
What's, you know, come up and talk,

01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:42.900
and we'll get to know people.

01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:44.900
Because we used to do that, and then we,

01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:46.900
I don't know why we stopped.

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:48.900
Who's having great pain, who's having a great day,

01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:49.900
but then sometimes you'd be like,

01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:52.900
just anybody who really, really has something to say or something.

01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:54.900
Yeah, I think I maybe started to feel like,

01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:56.900
well, we're not, it's not, it's like,

01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:59.900
oh, are we forming a whack pack like Howard Stern?

01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:04.900
Is it just becoming like a spectacle of some kind?

01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:06.900
But that was never the audience's fault.

01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:08.900
I think that was...

01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:10.900
I think you just found a lot of the wrong people sometimes

01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:12.900
when you were on tour.

01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:14.900
I just really recently re-listened to a bunch of stuff,

01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:17.900
so I'm kind of like remembering a lot of those moments now,

01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:20.900
and being like, yeah, I think you just got a couple of bad eggs

01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:22.900
along the way, and it kind of...

01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:24.900
I think in Los Angeles, out of Monday night, downtown,

01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:26.900
we can probably trust that, yeah.

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.900
Well, it also got to a point where like,

01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:32.900
we cut more fish than boots by casting that net,

01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:35.900
but like, it got to the point where the front couple of rows

01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:37.900
were people like boxing each other to try to be up there,

01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:40.900
to kind of be like, in the show.

01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:42.900
I think people were expecting to be the next Spencer

01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:44.900
or Adam Goldberg or whoever,

01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:48.900
and it was getting a little frisky for my money.

01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:49.900
That's the dream.

01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:51.900
That's the dream for like, almost,

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.900
I think a lot of people that listen to the podcast, everyone.

01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:55.900
Bad dreams of being Spencer, you know.

01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.900
Do better.

01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:00.900
Come on.

01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:02.900
Spencer, for those people having that dream,

01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:05.900
tell them one thing you did this week for me,

01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:07.900
that de-glamorizes.

01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:08.900
I dream about having a yacht.

01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:09.900
What?

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:10.900
I dream about having a yacht.

01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:12.900
Like, you could think bigger than being on a fucking podcast.

01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:16.900
No, but I'm saying tell the people dreaming of being the next Spencer

01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:20.900
one thing that you did this week for me

01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:23.900
that will disabuse them of their fantasies.

01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:25.900
Oh, um...

01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:26.900
Hmm.

01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:28.900
This week?

01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:30.900
Well, or recently, just a minute.

01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:32.900
Sorry.

01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:34.900
I like my job.

01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:35.900
All right.

01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:36.900
Okay, sorry.

01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:38.900
I just thought you'd have a fun...

01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:41.900
I mean, you have to do so much specific, like, tedious shit.

01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:43.900
I really like most of that stuff.

01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:44.900
It's fun.

01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:46.900
I feel activated and good.

01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:48.900
Yeah, I like that stuff too, just like...

01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:49.900
Oh, yeah.

01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:50.900
Spencer's healthy now.

01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:55.900
He had to oversee the hard installation of Tesla software

01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:59.900
onto my car that wasn't coming through Wi-Fi fast enough for me.

01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:00.900
Yeah.

01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:02.900
Spencer, are you self-actualized now?

01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:03.900
No, no.

01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:04.900
Okay.

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:05.900
I just...

01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:08.900
I follow your Instagram, so I know you've been going through this whole fitness thing

01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:11.900
and it's like, wow, he might be reaching actualization.

01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:15.900
I've always been healthier than most, even at my unhealthiest.

01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:16.900
Nice.

01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:18.900
And not arrogant at all.

01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:19.900
That's not arrogant.

01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:20.900
You...

01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:22.900
I'm not gonna say show it, because I don't want...

01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:24.900
It doesn't show up.

01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:25.900
I got like...

01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:26.900
He sent a text saying that...

01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:30.900
I'm uncomfortable telling friends I think I have a six pack.

01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:31.900
Ooh.

01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:32.900
It's not...

01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:33.900
I can't...

01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:34.900
It doesn't show up on film.

01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:35.900
Yeah, show it.

01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:39.900
It doesn't show up on film, and it doesn't show up except under the right lighting.

01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:46.900
And when those things are no longer true and it actually shows up, then I will show it.

01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:50.900
And it'll be soon, because the progress I've been making is encouraging.

01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:52.900
Cliff Hanger!

01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:55.900
Thank you, gang.

01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:56.900
Thanks, guys.

01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:57.900
Thanks, Caroline.

01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:58.900
Thank you, Asa.

01:55:58.900 --> 01:55:59.900
Thank you, Nova.

01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:00.900
Cheers.

01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:06.900
Also, there's always Zach, Chris, Jer, Nolan, everybody here.

01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:07.900
How many times...

01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:11.900
Spencer, your game master, everybody.

01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:13.900
Come to HarmonQuest.

01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:14.900
HarmonQuest.com.

01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:15.900
I'm the controller, Jeff Davis.

01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:18.900
One more time for your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:20.900
Thank you all.

01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:24.900
Drive fast, take chances, and if that doesn't work, tie him up with a rope and put him in a bush.

01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:25.900
Did you get any of that?

01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:50.900
It's a good show!
