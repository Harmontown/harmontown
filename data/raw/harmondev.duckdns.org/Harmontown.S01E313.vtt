is that something that works thank you oh I don't want to push buttons I want

02:24.640 --> 02:29.960
this to be an introduction something that's confessional when I went from

02:29.960 --> 02:34.240
now on when I talk about things that maybe push people's buttons I'm not

02:34.240 --> 02:39.160
going to I'm gonna make sure that I use my I statements and I'm gonna talk from

02:39.160 --> 02:44.800
a place of human vulnerability if I say something that is a political point of

02:44.800 --> 02:48.280
view or philosophical point of view about society whatever I'm gonna try to

02:48.280 --> 02:53.880
make sure that I'm not saying well these people this and those people that I

02:53.880 --> 02:57.560
don't know those people I know I know myself I'm gonna be honest and I'm

02:57.560 --> 03:04.720
gonna say what I feel and so my I was just I was just explaining to Spencer

03:04.720 --> 03:09.520
backstage that a dear friend of mine who I'll give their anonymity because the

03:09.520 --> 03:13.600
people that people that that that are passionate about things should I don't

03:13.600 --> 03:16.880
want I don't I don't yeah I just like this conversation I'm having with this

03:16.880 --> 03:21.000
person who keeps recommending this Jordan Peterson guy like you gotta listen

03:21.000 --> 03:26.520
to Jordan Peterson and and I keep I keep going like like yeah I will I mean by

03:26.520 --> 03:31.640
the way I haven't seen Atlanta yet it's on season nine so so when I when I when

03:31.640 --> 03:34.720
I don't bother to do something it's not because I hope but I don't think it's

03:34.720 --> 03:39.160
because I'm stubborn or or doing something but however I do keep saying

03:39.160 --> 03:43.680
to the person like I'm gonna I'm gonna listen to him because you say he's smart

03:43.680 --> 03:48.400
he's interesting and all this stuff but I will tell you that every that every

03:48.400 --> 03:53.960
link you send me and every time I Google it keeps saying like in it says from

03:53.960 --> 03:59.080
his from his fans and God knows people's fans can misrepresent them

03:59.080 --> 04:06.040
unintentionally thinking how do you know that then but but but it does say

04:06.040 --> 04:16.160
things like you know truth bomb Jordan Peterson debunks the concept of white

04:16.160 --> 04:23.600
privilege disproves the pay gap blah blah blah and and I don't you know and

04:23.600 --> 04:27.760
then I say that back to the person and then that person always says like they

04:27.760 --> 04:39.640
go he's really interesting but there's always it's like I never I never get a

04:39.640 --> 04:45.760
what what why is he a plumber what is he like what do you mean because the

04:45.760 --> 04:51.040
headline is that he debunked the concept of white privilege did he also tell you

04:51.040 --> 04:56.680
how to install a backsplash in your kitchen and so I but the reason I bring

04:56.680 --> 05:01.800
it up is not it was not too I certainly want this person to continue to I like

05:01.800 --> 05:07.120
people to share like if you're into somebody I fucking we bonded early on

05:07.120 --> 05:10.400
we love our gnome Chomsky like like who knows if he's fallen in and out of

05:10.400 --> 05:17.240
fashion but but but some people have to hear tonight so some some some some

05:17.240 --> 05:20.560
people could could turn red in the face when you mention his name some people

05:20.560 --> 05:23.560
roll their eyes automatically some people are very familiar with them and

05:23.560 --> 05:25.800
we'll do either of those things some people not familiar at all we'll do

05:25.800 --> 05:32.240
those things like it I you and I started a friendship to talking about because I

05:32.240 --> 05:35.760
knew him as a linguist and and you knew him as a political dissident and when

05:35.760 --> 05:41.040
we exchanged things and all these things so I don't want anybody to ever be

05:41.040 --> 05:45.760
afraid that they're gonna suggest I read something or listen to something that

05:45.760 --> 05:49.800
because I'm gonna like snootily high road them I brought it up because it's

05:49.800 --> 05:53.360
caused me to do some soul searching here because I'm explaining to the person

05:53.360 --> 05:57.880
that taught me some things about myself that that that I want to get off my

05:57.880 --> 06:04.960
chest which is like this it's like I'd like it's like oh you guys like I don't

06:04.960 --> 06:12.480
I don't I am not ashamed of the of the idea of what my detractors would call

06:12.480 --> 06:19.040
virtue signaling I I or white nighting or whatever kind of code for that stuff I

06:19.040 --> 06:26.000
don't understand unless you want to challenge society and change it go to

06:26.000 --> 06:31.520
toe-to-toe with it or get paid to talk about it why would you want to do

06:31.520 --> 06:38.160
anything other than make it not kill you I do like the therapist saying do you

06:38.160 --> 06:42.640
want to be happy or do you want to be right like I want to be happy so like

06:42.640 --> 06:47.960
like isn't that what virtue signaling is isn't it like if you're 45 white

06:47.960 --> 06:55.480
straight rich standing on top of a pile of money what why is it like why is it a

06:55.480 --> 07:02.320
betrayal why is it a bad move to shout down to all the poor people that you can

07:02.320 --> 07:10.320
hear you I'm gonna do everything I can to help you don't set this on fire I'm

07:10.320 --> 07:21.080
on top of it I like you and would like this to continue the way it is I like

07:21.080 --> 07:25.560
but shouldn't they be concerned that the money is just in a pile like that seems

07:25.560 --> 07:30.960
like well that's of course it's in a pile that brings up an interesting point

07:30.960 --> 07:35.640
which which is that also you know I actually don't think this is the ideal

07:35.640 --> 07:43.680
situation I'm gonna try even harder to achieve some changes because boy I can

07:43.680 --> 07:52.080
see your house from here and it's very small like like I died like people

07:52.080 --> 07:56.640
think that it's somehow a counter argument to say to that you're just

07:56.640 --> 08:02.520
saying what you think people want to hear so that you don't get beaten up or

08:02.520 --> 08:09.200
suffer what when did that become a valid point of view like oh are we

08:09.200 --> 08:16.480
revolutionaries when we when we like tell the truth is this about knowing the

08:16.480 --> 08:21.560
truth like do I want to really go home tonight and crack a book if I have a

08:21.560 --> 08:30.280
choice between two books and one says female lesbian colon how women are

08:30.280 --> 08:35.840
treated unfairly and have been since the dawn of humankind asterisk notice we

08:35.840 --> 08:41.480
didn't say mankind because fuck men and then the other book is like the big lie

08:41.480 --> 08:47.640
how liberalism is no different from Nazis and why Nazism isn't that bad

08:47.640 --> 08:56.680
anyway which I I I still have that I still have I still have that one for

08:56.680 --> 09:03.000
sale on Amazon right now I told you not to self-publish I told you I try you're

09:03.000 --> 09:06.320
gonna end up spending more than you make you you're you're being a real

09:06.320 --> 09:14.600
feminine capital Nazi right you the the but I'm gonna I'm gonna if I'm if I'm

09:14.600 --> 09:19.040
on a sinking ship and I'm like I got one book for the next ten years I'm gonna

09:19.040 --> 09:24.680
not because I'm so fucking noble and open-minded I'm gonna I'm gonna take the

09:24.680 --> 09:29.840
the feminist book because it's gonna have more information that that I don't

09:29.840 --> 09:35.400
already have and don't suffer from you know I'm kind of like I don't yeah I

09:35.400 --> 09:41.280
just read my book just give it a chance I don't want to know I don't want to be

09:41.280 --> 09:45.040
able to if I I don't want to be in a convoy what conversation am I ever gonna

09:45.040 --> 09:49.680
have in the future where I'm gonna be thinking boy oh boy this would go so

09:49.680 --> 09:54.800
much better as bad as it's going God it would go better if I just had the

09:54.800 --> 10:02.520
academic chops to prove that maternity leave is unfair I just god damn it I

10:02.520 --> 10:08.560
don't have the fucking noodle for it I do have the noodle for it that's the

10:08.560 --> 10:15.360
problem whether I believe it passionately or not what I don't have in my

10:15.360 --> 10:20.760
head is the is the is the reasons why people be talking about other stuff and

10:20.760 --> 10:30.520
I want to I want people to like me I just and I don't where do you stand I'm

10:30.520 --> 10:41.280
building seven what's the what is the least popular opinion what I I it's I

10:41.280 --> 10:48.880
Spencer said something really funny cuz we were talking about cuz I'm gonna

10:48.880 --> 10:53.040
listen to the Jordan Peterson thing but you were you were talking about the

10:53.040 --> 10:56.320
natural naturalist thing when you're going like some of this stuff is like

10:56.320 --> 11:00.640
people say you gotta listen to this guy and then you listen to the guy and it's

11:00.640 --> 11:04.320
like oh he's so smart it's like they got a PhD and they're like oh man they gave

11:04.320 --> 11:08.040
a lecture and it was so amazing the way they broke it down and like a lot of it

11:08.040 --> 11:13.240
comes down to like naturalism tropes where it's like hey people aren't

11:13.240 --> 11:17.080
naturally monogamous or the way humans work isn't like this or that it's like

11:17.080 --> 11:22.200
and I and I said yeah but people don't poop in toilets naturally like we just

11:22.200 --> 11:28.600
kind of yeah toilets are great and use and you said yeah it's Spencer's

11:28.600 --> 11:35.720
summation of the naturalist fallacy is like is like hey man ducks don't be gay

11:35.720 --> 11:41.040
that's the that's the fallacy people say yeah the naturalization

11:41.040 --> 11:45.480
see is ducks don't be gay I didn't I didn't I didn't service it in the retail

11:45.480 --> 11:51.720
it's that it's that people say oh this isn't natural therefore it's bad and

11:51.720 --> 11:55.680
then they say like oh you know like like an argument against gay marriage or

11:55.680 --> 11:59.560
whatever it's like gay being gay is unnatural it's like ducks aren't gay in

11:59.560 --> 12:03.440
the wild animals aren't gay and then of course animals are gay in the wild but

12:03.440 --> 12:08.440
like but like that it's a fallacy that people make to prove their point when

12:08.440 --> 12:13.360
they get but a fallacy is an invalid argument by nature anyway I I do a lot

12:13.360 --> 12:18.880
of research I love it I'm on I'm online all the time checking things reading

12:18.880 --> 12:24.720
things who knows if they're good or bad I don't know it's the internet but

12:24.720 --> 12:28.720
basically everything that I understand about Jordan Peterson just comes down

12:28.720 --> 12:33.520
to that fallacy it's like well actually it turns out like lobsters like kill

12:33.520 --> 12:36.920
each other and so like it's fine to want to kill each other or like you know it's

12:36.920 --> 12:40.880
just all that fallacy where it's just like well no that's not true that's

12:40.880 --> 12:45.120
something else is sometimes he's giving a giving one of those talks and if

12:45.120 --> 12:48.880
somebody just starts go from the audience going like hey I like your wife I

12:48.880 --> 12:53.240
want to fuck your wife he's like sorry excuse me like he wouldn't have security

12:53.240 --> 12:57.400
escort that person out right because he doesn't believe in marriage and he'd be

12:57.400 --> 13:02.400
happy if he is married to have a stronger person with a louder voice that that

13:02.400 --> 13:08.160
felt like talking at that moment like microphones aren't fucking cavemen but

13:08.160 --> 13:11.800
I'm not I'm not I'm not speak I'm not lampooning this person that because I

13:11.800 --> 13:15.400
don't want to commit the crime of like making you you've you've you've maybe

13:15.400 --> 13:20.160
read or heard him I'm I'm I'm just lame I'm just done I'm just riffing on the

13:20.160 --> 13:24.880
idea of like the people that go like you know monogamy is not a thing like in

13:24.880 --> 13:30.880
58 countries and stuff it's like yeah man I when did you ever get the

13:30.880 --> 13:35.440
impression that humanity like wanted to be natural like like how is that our

13:35.440 --> 13:40.880
gimmick like like what I just I just so confounded by it and I kind of like

13:40.880 --> 13:44.120
maybe I wasn't confounded by it six years ago I mean I know if you listen to

13:44.120 --> 13:48.880
this podcast you're gonna hear me take complete 180s on a lot of fundamental

13:48.880 --> 13:53.440
stuff and I I don't I'm not gonna chalk it up to turbulent times or anything

13:53.440 --> 13:58.720
changing I'm gonna I'm gonna first and foremost say I'm old I am I am thank

13:58.720 --> 14:06.440
God successful I I I just I just have this amazing like weird unsettling

14:06.440 --> 14:11.080
couples therapy session with Cody we went we went in to get the 60,000 mile

14:11.080 --> 14:17.280
checkup and kind of we were like it was a because we had back-to-back sessions

14:17.280 --> 14:21.520
that we're gonna be solo but if we come in together that is like like that's our

14:21.520 --> 14:26.280
choice and then play so it was like basically like it could it could have

14:26.280 --> 14:32.000
been a two-hour session or a two you know two whatever 50 plus 50 is a hundred

14:32.000 --> 14:43.440
a hundred minute session what is 50 plus 50 and it was like way more than like

14:43.440 --> 14:47.040
20 minutes before the end of an hour clearly the therapist just ran out of

14:47.040 --> 14:55.520
gas was like by virtue of our happiness like she was like huh okay well ah look

14:55.520 --> 15:04.640
I don't know what to tell you guys you you love each other and you communicate

15:04.640 --> 15:09.520
and that seems to be working and I gotta tell you I've had a pretty long day of

15:09.520 --> 15:13.080
heterosexual couple couples like fucking bringing me down with a bunch of shit

15:13.080 --> 15:15.320
about the same shit you're talking about cuz they don't know how to do what

15:15.320 --> 15:18.840
you guys do which is you kind of just like each other don't you yeah I think

15:18.840 --> 15:24.360
it's working I think it's working and you know what it's it's five o'clock and

15:24.360 --> 15:26.960
I was like yeah I'll go eat and Cody's like yep let's get out of here I'm

15:26.960 --> 15:31.080
hungry it was a yep let's get out of here bye but like like like we're fucking

15:31.080 --> 15:34.880
perfect so you nailed it we did it

15:38.840 --> 15:43.240
and I gotta tell you I'm kind of I get I'm getting the same five in my solo

15:43.240 --> 15:47.960
sessions too I think I'm a perfect individual as well so you know you know

15:47.960 --> 15:51.600
when you've nailed it with your therapist when you've bored her to pieces

15:51.600 --> 15:54.600
and she wants to get the fuck yeah she's sort of like and I kind of project

15:54.600 --> 15:57.880
on her because I'm a cynic I'm like I've done a storyteller I'm kind of just

15:57.880 --> 16:01.960
thinking like oh she's a married lesbian I wonder if part of her is thinking like

16:01.960 --> 16:06.280
yeah must be nice what the fuck get out of here you know it's like cuz it's

16:06.280 --> 16:08.880
like we're specific we're talking about well maybe we're gonna move in together

16:08.880 --> 16:13.320
and and you know we we we think about children but we don't think about

16:13.320 --> 16:17.160
children and all this stuff and like just kind of like I know it's probably

16:17.160 --> 16:20.240
not the case because she just makes these faces she has these like faces she

16:20.240 --> 16:23.840
makes when she's actually like when she's certain about things and it kind of

16:23.840 --> 16:29.360
just like doubles as someone who is secretly hateful but I it's not okay

16:29.360 --> 16:35.320
but she's just kind of like yeah you know seems like it's working huh huh yeah

16:35.320 --> 16:41.160
yeah and I'm I like thinking that she wants to stab our eyes out because she's

16:41.160 --> 16:46.600
like must be nice time to go home to my lesbian wife god damn it

16:49.520 --> 16:55.960
that is not me saying that lesbians are less happy no I am absolutely what you

16:55.960 --> 17:00.080
said that is not true that's not what I well it may be true that that's what I

17:00.080 --> 17:04.760
accidentally applied but I absolutely the grass is always greener I picture

17:04.760 --> 17:08.480
lesbians as being incredibly happy because you probably have to and I'm

17:08.480 --> 17:14.920
sure they fight all the time like like cats and cats all right come on stupid

17:14.920 --> 17:21.800
it's Dom it's stupid well cast stupid stupid dumb jokes the but I actually I

17:21.800 --> 17:25.000
always picture gay people as happier than straight people in couples because you

17:25.000 --> 17:31.720
then it's probably a revert like a kind of a different form of not what do you

17:31.720 --> 17:34.720
call it's easy to say like oh that's a different form of racism but you can't

17:34.720 --> 17:37.880
say it's a different form of homophobia because you're not phobic but it's still

17:37.880 --> 17:44.760
it's still dehumanizing to say I bet gay people are happier than straight

17:44.760 --> 17:49.360
people you're still saying like gay you know because they're so different but

17:49.360 --> 17:56.440
you know I'll cause I picture I picture a gay couple like like the gay partner

17:56.440 --> 18:02.640
number one comes home and puts their gay why is one partner number one because I

18:02.640 --> 18:06.720
didn't want to be like the guy can't be like the gay husband because that's the

18:06.720 --> 18:15.360
good thing we do is like well who's the caboose and how I was like straight

18:15.360 --> 18:18.400
people want to like project their child like which one of you's gonna wear the

18:18.400 --> 18:25.720
tux and I had to learn that that's that's not a thing that they love like

18:25.720 --> 18:30.840
I like you know like it's like the Tatanka thing in

18:30.840 --> 18:33.840
dances with wolves like you fucking like listen and you you're gonna be wrong

18:33.840 --> 18:36.840
about shit and you try to achieve like I'm gonna stop you you're doing this

18:36.840 --> 18:45.480
wrong so so I but I always picture regardless of that I picture here's

18:45.480 --> 18:51.120
what I picture how do you picture how do I picture a gay gay gay partner number

18:51.120 --> 18:59.640
one comes home puts gay briefcase down and I'm sorry gay part of everyone

18:59.640 --> 19:03.800
comes home and does what puts gay briefcase down gay brief why is the

19:03.800 --> 19:09.320
gay why is the briefcase gay because they're not a sellout because they didn't

19:09.320 --> 19:11.880
let their job define them because they're fucked because when they go to

19:11.880 --> 19:16.280
work it's with a gay briefcase I'm more on that later okay that's about personal

19:16.280 --> 19:21.840
fulfillment like I'm talking about coming back to briefcase identity right

19:21.840 --> 19:27.760
they put their briefcase down and then the gay couple gay part participant in

19:27.760 --> 19:35.200
gay couple number two is in bed doing a crossword and and says how was your day

19:35.200 --> 19:40.720
and and the answer is you know it was and they and they rattle off like a

19:40.720 --> 19:45.600
bunch of things that make your day neutral Gary at work still still doing

19:45.600 --> 19:52.440
the thing where he calls my briefcase gay and Dan keeps trying to prove he's

19:52.440 --> 19:56.560
not homophobic by asking those questions about who wore the tux at the

19:56.560 --> 20:01.840
wedding and and all these things and then and then they go yeah it was a hard

20:01.840 --> 20:05.600
thinking it was like and then they and then I just pictured them going like but

20:05.600 --> 20:10.480
I know one thing for sure I love you and then what you know what it's probably an

20:10.480 --> 20:13.720
internal process not an external one but I picture inside their brains I'm

20:13.720 --> 20:20.560
going like I I'm able to believe that more than the average straight person

20:20.560 --> 20:28.360
because this isn't fucking sanctioned it's it was more difficult to get here it

20:28.360 --> 20:35.280
was harder to like it like there's there's already friction in just like

20:35.280 --> 20:40.880
getting here about myself and then I found you and then the two of us are

20:40.880 --> 20:46.120
together and that who knows who approved of that or not but in any case boy when

20:46.120 --> 20:50.240
we wake up in the morning we really have to ask ourselves do I want to do this

20:50.240 --> 20:56.360
and if we and if we fucking stop wanting it Newtonian physics will fucking

20:56.360 --> 21:02.920
fling it apart like our parents will pay us like they'll be like thank God

21:02.920 --> 21:10.160
you're straight I knew it like like all of that like you know it's like like so

21:10.160 --> 21:14.960
that's probably all that's an example of how you can have the you can be an

21:14.960 --> 21:19.920
advocate you can be a supporter and you can still be you know part of the

21:19.920 --> 21:25.640
problem because because I'm thinking of these people as a different species I'm

21:25.640 --> 21:31.360
thinking of them as oh Marvel or versus DC or something like like but they have

21:31.360 --> 21:37.080
Green Lantern meetings where they can make parties out of that as long as

21:37.080 --> 21:41.600
they're not yellow I just can't believe that you that you think of briefcases

21:41.600 --> 21:46.800
as being binary yeah you know you guys know what I'm picturing when I say

21:46.800 --> 21:54.680
straight briefcase no no no we don't know you you fucking tell me what you

21:54.680 --> 21:58.360
think of when you think of straight briefcase you know a fucking goose step

21:58.360 --> 22:05.440
in brown ass fucking thing with the dial code and the fucking combinations your

22:05.440 --> 22:12.560
birthday because your fucking cisgender heteronormative piece of shit and who

22:12.560 --> 22:16.000
cares about that the code's probably one two three four because you know what's

22:16.000 --> 22:24.040
in there a bunch of fucking pictures of the opposite sex naked yawn

22:30.480 --> 22:36.680
good save good say I don't need I don't need saves I'm fucking honest you can't

22:36.680 --> 22:42.760
say I'm fucking lampooning myself I'm delightful you are delightful I'm not

22:42.760 --> 22:46.240
sure of the right to remain there is no such thing as a save when you're a

22:46.240 --> 22:51.840
Harlem Globetrotter like my job isn't to beat the Washington generals it's not

22:51.840 --> 22:55.560
real basketball I'm fucking full of fucking like I got a bucket of confetti

22:55.560 --> 23:05.480
in my shorts it's it's it's about being fucking real prove it prove it you have

23:05.480 --> 23:10.640
to subscribe to see that I really did it yeah for $5 a month he didn't have any

23:10.640 --> 23:17.560
confetti in his shorts yeah so anyways I don't know yeah I just like that

23:17.560 --> 23:21.360
conversation with my friend thank God I have a friend who's like pushing Jordan

23:21.360 --> 23:25.280
Peterson I mean because that make me actually explore myself and go well if

23:25.280 --> 23:28.480
I don't if I don't stay on this schedule of I promise to listen to him

23:28.480 --> 23:32.040
tomorrow it's probably because I've actually made a decision in my life I

23:32.040 --> 23:35.240
should acknowledge which is that I'm a little more interested in boning up on

23:35.240 --> 23:41.200
how to function like I'm more interested in how to let people know that

23:41.200 --> 23:46.000
despite the shape of my face the placement of my eyebrows that the the

23:46.000 --> 23:52.320
Google auto conclusions of my name the the everything that you may have heard

23:52.320 --> 23:58.440
about me that actually I am very interested in you being comfortable with

23:58.440 --> 24:03.680
me and that that's actually like if you see me outside of my house it's because

24:03.680 --> 24:06.840
I chose to leave the house and that while I'm outside the house I actually

24:06.840 --> 24:10.640
regarded as a shared world with you and that I would like to make sure that you

24:10.640 --> 24:15.280
don't leave the conversation frowning even if you're crazy like like like like

24:15.280 --> 24:19.240
because one out of ten people is and I'm like well we can't fucking let them

24:19.240 --> 24:23.240
shape the our opinions of strangers like you like what if you know like like

24:23.240 --> 24:29.000
like how guarded are we gonna be against Mark David Chapman's you know like like

24:29.000 --> 24:34.280
like like at the expense of like not meeting more novas or or or or Jane

24:34.280 --> 24:43.640
Jane cooks or or or or or Spencers or this guy Jeff Davis who's just mad

24:43.640 --> 24:49.360
because his briefcase is straight that's all you're mad about I have a

24:49.360 --> 24:54.920

it's got a little pouch that I usually put like the book I'm reading in and

25:25.920 --> 25:33.800
enjoy being a briefcase that's great hey can I just I talked to this person who

25:33.800 --> 25:39.600
may have been crazy at a point pretty recently and not too far from here

25:39.600 --> 25:43.960
actually it was like off of Wilshire or whatever there is a guy that I locked my

25:43.960 --> 25:49.960
car in a parking garage and so I had to get an uber away to my house and then I

25:49.960 --> 25:54.120
took it back in the morning and he was there both times and at night I wanted

25:54.120 --> 25:56.800
to give him money but I didn't have it so in the morning I came back and give

25:56.800 --> 26:01.640
him money and then we were talking and he was like he was like you know all the

26:01.640 --> 26:05.200
I used to be a chiropractor all these chiropractors are quacks man all these

26:05.200 --> 26:08.360
chiropractors are getting put into jail because they're killing people they're

26:08.360 --> 26:13.280
breaking their carotid arteries when they're given adjustments man I know it

26:13.280 --> 26:18.040
I wrote the book on chiropractor you know me my name is Dr. John chiropractor

26:18.040 --> 26:23.640
and he was like is he rapping is he a rapper no no he was like he is like he

26:23.640 --> 26:31.280
really had a pretty tight whatever what I mean cadence and so like he was just

26:31.280 --> 26:35.240
going on but it was like at first it was like you know I used to be a chiropractor

26:35.240 --> 26:39.160
on hard times and I was like oh crazy and then then he was like yeah you know

26:39.160 --> 26:42.400
all these chiropractors are killing their patients and stuff and I was like

26:42.400 --> 26:47.320
well why do you why are you talking about that like that's I don't you know I

26:47.320 --> 26:49.960
don't have any intersection with chiropractors other than you right now

26:49.960 --> 26:55.200
they kill people did he ever get a was he like so anyways I'm not licensed but

26:55.200 --> 26:58.600
you look like your back hurts and I promise I won't break your carotid

26:58.600 --> 27:03.160
artery no no it was none of that he wasn't he wasn't trying to do anything

27:03.160 --> 27:09.640
we were just talking you know I'm sure you just wanted to say what's up I sat

27:09.640 --> 27:18.080
next to a guy at El Cholo is that the name of the you know it is yeah and I

27:18.080 --> 27:21.880
chose there were there were seats available at the bar there was a fella

27:21.880 --> 27:28.960
at the bar who was wrapped in an American flag and had a cowboy hat on and

27:28.960 --> 27:34.000
he was a he was a little guy and and he was like eating tortilla soup like it

27:34.000 --> 27:42.040
was like fuck the last like like it had oxygen in it and he was on Mars and I

27:42.040 --> 27:50.480
was like oh I know where I'm sitting and I know what I'm ordering and and I sat

27:50.480 --> 27:56.800
down next to him and when I did he was like what's up yeah like this kind of

27:56.800 --> 28:04.280
like challenging like like like yeah I'm wrapped in an American flag right yeah and I and I was

28:04.280 --> 28:10.640
like nothing how are you and he's like good and then he went back to his soup

28:10.640 --> 28:15.760
damn and as I just sat there and I was like this is great yeah because I proved

28:15.760 --> 28:24.480
that I'm not judgmental and I don't have to talk to him to prove it yeah he's I

28:24.480 --> 28:27.720
sat next to the exact right person because I sat next to anybody else who knows

28:27.720 --> 28:32.280
with it like I'm a dentist how are you oh the people misjudged the value of the

28:32.280 --> 28:37.320
tooth but maybe I don't know it's just a word of advice maybe that person that

28:37.320 --> 28:43.600
you look at and go oh a tin foil robot maybe maybe maybe they're like they're

28:43.600 --> 28:47.120
wearing that because they're like try me and then you simply not trying them

28:47.120 --> 28:51.760
makes you the best person they've ever met he was literally wrapped in an actual

28:51.760 --> 28:56.200
flag yeah like a cave like a cape not not a garment that was made to no no be

28:56.200 --> 29:02.360
a garment just just a cape no it's cheaper that way right and so this is

29:02.360 --> 29:07.800
like if you pressed X to diffuse the situation kind of in red and then it's

29:07.800 --> 29:13.440
like it's plus honor you know really one this is El Cholo in Los Angeles this

29:13.440 --> 29:21.680

31:01.360 --> 31:06.880
Colombian I've never I've never seen somebody I was I'm dating a young

31:06.880 --> 31:10.560
lady 12 years younger than me there's a lot and she's a valley girl there's a

31:10.560 --> 31:15.120
lot of things that she knows like like like I can't tell it so every every

31:15.120 --> 31:19.620
Christmas Jordan we watch every Christmas right every Christmas we've

31:19.620 --> 31:23.000
tried we I think we figured out yesterday that we do this every Christmas

31:23.000 --> 31:25.560
but we never remember because we're drunk we try to watch all the diehard

31:25.560 --> 31:30.960
movies and and I think every it's a groundhog day like I'm always like you've

31:30.960 --> 31:34.880
never seen diehard no like well you got to see the sequel it's really

31:34.880 --> 31:40.160
uncomfortable and okay let's watch all of them okay the third one gets kind of

31:40.160 --> 31:47.480
amazing because it's so intensely racially aware and and and then we

31:47.480 --> 31:49.880
always have but then we started noticing because it's like it comes up and

31:49.880 --> 31:54.920
says resume playing and it's right at the end like we've done this before we've

31:54.920 --> 32:01.360
watched all the diehards we always fall asleep before the first Simon says

32:01.360 --> 32:05.560
booby trap in the fountain remember when you and me and Schrab and Chris Tom

32:05.560 --> 32:09.880
and tried to watch all the hellraisers and we fucking just damn there's seven of

32:09.880 --> 32:15.580
them there's almost seven diehards now for real yeah there's like five there

32:15.580 --> 32:19.080
might is there six there I know there's what you're raising your oh you're

32:19.080 --> 32:22.960
you're holding up the number five I thought you were like like can I come

32:22.960 --> 32:32.160
up because there's 11 and I got a degree in diehard at Columbia anyways so the

32:32.160 --> 32:35.400
song's called smoke the reason I thought we're listed a true crime podcast so

32:35.400 --> 32:38.400
there were these a couple months all the true crime podcast like all said the

32:38.400 --> 32:45.320
same thing a couple months ago there was this family they they they 17 year old

32:45.320 --> 32:50.760
girl escaped from the family she called 911 and and the cop showed up and she

32:50.760 --> 32:56.240
said my kid my siblings have been imprisoned for fucking 20 years in our

32:56.240 --> 33:00.680
house it was like you might remember that it was like this news item about this

33:00.680 --> 33:05.720
this family that kept all 13 of their kids like chained to their beds for

33:05.720 --> 33:11.720
like forever and some of them were in their 20s because you can't have like

33:11.720 --> 33:16.760
that many kids without some of them being in their 20s like like it takes like up

33:16.760 --> 33:21.160
to nine months to make each one and you have to lie fallow once every three

33:21.160 --> 33:26.000
years so they just had like that so they had full grown adults who are like

33:26.000 --> 33:30.920
malnourished and anyways the family's the last name is the Turpins and we're

33:30.920 --> 33:33.120
like holy shit what's up with these Turpins and then I just started you know

33:33.120 --> 33:35.480
we're feeding the dogs and we're just kind of high and I'm like I've been

33:35.480 --> 33:43.040
turpin and Cody's laughing and I'm like doing this I've been turpin oh yeah you

33:43.040 --> 33:47.280
know I've been turpin and she's like what is that song and I'm like I think it's

33:47.280 --> 33:50.200
like what is it I've been smoking I'm smoking what is that song and I was

33:50.200 --> 33:53.240
like is that I believe in miracles what is it it's really clever you've been

33:53.240 --> 33:56.200
looking for and then I find it it's called stroking this song is like what is

33:56.200 --> 34:01.360
this song I agree before you even play it this song is fucking strange it is so

34:01.360 --> 34:06.880
fucking weird for the weirdest reasons because the guy is it about fucking or

34:06.880 --> 34:12.360
second or stroking or I don't know that's part of the twist is it is that so

34:12.360 --> 34:15.560
I don't think I don't think I'm allowed to play it I don't think I play it who

34:15.560 --> 34:20.880
gives a fuck is stroking gonna sue us well we could always delete it later

34:20.880 --> 34:26.600
I guess if I assume like if I say like how about this like I mean I play it like

34:26.600 --> 34:31.680
like what is it it costs like 35 grand to like buy like a Sarah Bareilles song

34:31.680 --> 34:35.680
but we can delete it at any time if we want to just not put it on we can delete

34:35.680 --> 34:39.720
it tomorrow before it drops it's fine to play it as a live performance in this

34:39.720 --> 34:44.800
room oh that I know so so right right right but but if you don't want it to

34:44.800 --> 34:50.320
exist forever we want we might have to drop it and just right yeah I do think

34:50.320 --> 34:53.840
it's valuable to just like it's important but we could bleep it and tell

34:53.840 --> 34:59.800
him go online and listen to it online well I type because these folks they

34:59.800 --> 35:06.600
can't do that that would be rude to the show we're kind of a lot of like younger

35:06.600 --> 35:09.800
people in the audience that you know they're like they have no

35:09.800 --> 35:16.240
left here it is it's like right one point yeah he's uh stroking this is

35:16.240 --> 35:20.360
something that I'll be doing tonight like it goes into stroking is that

35:20.360 --> 35:24.960
something that are we doing tonight is always said more or less he I know he

35:24.960 --> 35:29.520
strokes it to the left I'm pretty sure he strokes it to the right how could you

35:29.520 --> 35:34.280
know I'm a I'm a Libra so you gotta stroke it to the left and stroke it to

35:34.280 --> 35:38.520
the right because I'm about I'm about balance the signals really weak in here

35:38.520 --> 35:41.800
I think I'm gonna I'm gonna bail on the plan play the fucking song no I'm gonna

35:41.800 --> 35:46.520
I'm just just said the opposite right so if you take the opposite point of view

35:46.520 --> 35:53.000
that what you're doing is you're just putting the brakes I knowing it isn't

35:53.000 --> 36:00.200
that I'm not hey I know it too God if only someone knew the way I have the

36:00.200 --> 36:08.480
lyrics written down I don't need someone to know them okay so so he says well

36:08.480 --> 36:13.840
this is great we don't have that anything right and they'll Google it anyway so he

36:13.840 --> 36:20.560
says he he's the protagonist essentially right yeah yeah I mean yeah it's not

36:20.560 --> 36:27.560
about Dracula he says I it's the first person I don't like he never says on

36:27.560 --> 36:31.320
the song by the way I've been Dracula this whole time oh and no and quite

36:31.320 --> 36:35.240
frankly actually toward the end he in a very smart branding move he has a woman

36:35.240 --> 36:53.600
cry out his name many many oh okay it started playing so oh wait sorry that's

36:53.600 --> 37:13.960
partway into the song okay so so let's stop it there when I start making love

37:13.960 --> 37:20.840
I don't just make love I'd be stroking right so now I'm gonna ask the question

37:20.840 --> 37:26.760
later what does he think we're gonna think he means and what could he

37:26.760 --> 37:32.640
possibly mean if he doesn't mean and I have I am I am the last person to shame

37:32.640 --> 37:38.480
him for this because I literally be stroking during making love in a variety

37:38.480 --> 37:43.600
of ways like I'm very like happy to involve self-pleasure in a queer

37:43.600 --> 37:51.360
intersectionality with fucking like sex is a journey not a destination right

37:51.360 --> 37:55.440
it's that you fucking hang out with somebody it's a it's a thing you do for

37:55.440 --> 37:59.040
a while and when it stops it stops and whoever's stroking is stroking you have

37:59.040 --> 38:08.360
been you you have been stroking in your own whatever yeah I mean it's like like

38:08.360 --> 38:11.280
my therapist said to me at one point she's like you know you're gonna be in a

38:11.280 --> 38:15.600
relationship one day where you're gonna feel like masturbating while you're

38:15.600 --> 38:19.120
playing a video game and your girlfriend is gonna be in the same building and

38:19.120 --> 38:26.920
you're gonna think I'm gonna go find her and and and make it her problem as a

38:26.920 --> 38:31.640
word as a as a path of least resistance I was good and I was like that's not

38:31.640 --> 38:34.760
true that's not how monogamy ends up working like come on we tug one out

38:34.760 --> 38:37.080
whether in the shower and we cut because we don't want to like have

38:37.080 --> 38:39.640
conversations about blah blah blah and it's like no that's all about shame and

38:39.640 --> 38:43.600
all this stuff is like sure enough I was like goddamn I'm horny I knowing that I

38:43.600 --> 38:49.680
there's no shame in me being able to just fucking start stroking and Cody can

38:49.680 --> 38:53.920
either be fine with that or I guess I was like like it's not about getting caught

38:53.920 --> 38:58.640
doing it trying not to wake them up but it's like like Dix hard stroke stroke

38:58.640 --> 39:02.360
stroke and then like and like because she'll she'll do it too it's like like

39:02.360 --> 39:05.840
we'll be watching Superman too and she'll be like yeah and I'll be like what

39:05.840 --> 39:11.720
did you fart and she goes no I came like you just masturbated and she's like

39:11.720 --> 39:16.600
yeah I'm the fucking master and I'm like this bitch is amazing and I'm off the

39:16.600 --> 39:23.200
hook forever like that is what you need is a partner during Superman to dick

39:23.200 --> 39:30.240
Donna got fired off that movie she still came so she be stroking you be

39:30.240 --> 39:33.480
strong anyways I'm not judging the guy I'm just saying like the guy that's what

39:33.480 --> 39:37.400
he's eating with I'm just saying I think we've already in the first three like

39:37.400 --> 39:42.200
lyrics we've crossed a threshold into his world right and it's already weird

39:42.200 --> 39:46.120
like he's he's presenting it is weird because when I'm making love I'm not

39:46.120 --> 39:56.720
just making love I'm also stroking and I'm like okay maybe he has like oxygen

39:56.720 --> 40:10.280
lost to his brain tell tell me more clearance Carter that's cool he's

40:10.280 --> 40:37.840
stroking it to her okay now he now let me ask you something okay this list start

40:37.840 --> 40:42.840
better start getting way more fucking adventurous because so far you're

40:42.840 --> 40:49.040
literally listing the most common times for love making but guess what he's

40:49.040 --> 40:55.520
just going to run down a list of the laziest ways to make love but he's

40:55.520 --> 41:00.560
chalice chest and up on the listener he's good there's a couple more items

41:00.560 --> 41:05.840
and he gets increasingly defiant like what about this and every time it gets

41:05.840 --> 41:13.160
more more common I just wanted to have you ever made love during a lunar eclipse

41:13.160 --> 41:41.800
have you ever made love at Lover's Lane okay it's in not on are you are you the

41:41.800 --> 41:50.520
monsters on the backseat do you drive an Excalibur are you are you on a plow this

41:50.520 --> 41:56.600
record's called bucket list bucket list for for for De Niro's character and

41:56.600 --> 42:07.680
awakenings like like too soon for a tennis ball with your right hand have

42:07.680 --> 42:14.040
you ever made love when you were 17 and it was uncontrollable have it has dry

42:14.040 --> 42:20.120
humping ever led to making love but but but is he leading to something grander

42:20.120 --> 42:26.520
no he's leading to a segue that's I don't like like how did this song become a

42:26.520 --> 42:32.640
weird neurotypical challenge because people have you ever made love when

42:32.640 --> 42:37.680
you're drunk what does he imagine what does he imagine is the other side of

42:37.680 --> 42:41.320
that are they saying well no that's very cool please continue I think he

42:41.320 --> 42:45.360
imagine only talking to his parents who are like it's a four-poster bed or

42:45.360 --> 42:50.720
you're going to hell or are they like saying yeah I have and he's like well

42:50.720 --> 42:54.600
what about in the backseat of a car and he's like yeah I have and they're like

42:54.600 --> 42:58.480
well what about on the moon I think he is I think that's what it is because he's

42:58.480 --> 43:02.800
about to tell a story about about the backseat it's like a segue well it just

43:02.800 --> 43:07.840
seems like very much like bragging and I didn't want to leap into he takes it to

43:07.840 --> 43:12.320
the bridge is like I'm gonna walk you into my world where hey look there's

43:12.320 --> 43:15.080
different ways sometimes you're in the backseat of a car the story takes place

43:15.080 --> 43:18.360
in the backseat of car because police are about to be involved and I don't want

43:18.360 --> 43:22.360
you to picture them coming into my bedroom and so yes I was in the backseat

43:22.360 --> 43:28.200
of a car and in case you're gonna be thrown by that police car no he wasn't

43:28.200 --> 43:32.120
a police sorry sorry sorry I'm just saying I'm just thinking like oh he's

43:32.120 --> 43:37.480
just setting he's he's inviting us into yeah and like have you hey hey he's like

43:37.480 --> 43:41.200
being like Kinsey you know he's going like hey how fucking straight are you man

43:41.200 --> 43:44.320
when it comes to locations and times where you're making love you make love

43:44.320 --> 43:48.720
all over the place don't you including the backseat of the car okay so he's

43:48.720 --> 43:53.480
saying are you freaky but he's saying look I'm not even that freaky I make

43:53.480 --> 43:56.920
love sometimes before breakfast I make sometimes during the late-late show

43:56.920 --> 44:03.280
right sometimes on a couch sometimes in the back of a car I'm kind of walking

44:03.280 --> 44:09.200
you into my world right where I am a regular person right so so and I'd be

44:09.200 --> 44:13.320
stroking on regular thing when you find out the payoff you're gonna be like well

44:13.320 --> 44:17.160
why did why was that plank necessary why can't you just jump into a pool this

44:17.160 --> 44:22.120
shallow because it's called it's called verse verse chorus bridge where they

44:22.120 --> 44:26.200
take it to a nether place they walk you into across the but I will know this

44:26.200 --> 44:28.840
song is breaking all the rules right away because the only other song that

44:28.840 --> 44:33.400
does this to my glee is Eric Clapton's it's in the way that you use it like you

44:33.400 --> 44:37.980
notice he just it just starts like boom hey make a lot I've been

44:37.980 --> 44:42.880
stroking not like he doesn't even like there's no verse it's not like you know

44:42.880 --> 44:46.840
I'm gonna tell you about the wild thing for a while and then wild thing it's like

44:46.840 --> 44:50.440
he kind of like gets into it okay take us to the bridge take us to the bridge

44:50.440 --> 44:58.200
all right here we go if I can maybe I'll take us to the door

44:58.200 --> 45:08.760
okay so I just want to speak on behalf of the police there in that situation

45:08.760 --> 45:15.600
say still the same charges apply sir I don't know if you're if you're speaking

45:15.600 --> 45:21.040
in terms of legal jurisprudence but our job is to put your dick back in your

45:21.040 --> 45:25.920
pants because your car is a place where police can see it but when he goes to

45:25.920 --> 45:32.000
court I guarantee you his defense is gonna be define what stroking is and

45:32.000 --> 45:35.720
that's the twist that's coming and it's coming it's coming unintentionally

45:35.720 --> 45:39.160
because and I don't know if it's intention I don't think it's intentional

45:39.160 --> 45:43.440
because there's another twist in the song that is intentional the one that's

45:43.440 --> 45:48.080
unintentional is that he finally will use stroking with it as a verb with a

45:48.080 --> 45:51.800
subject I don't know if it's the correct term object or subject but that

45:51.800 --> 45:58.000
there's a that he'll he'll say what he's stroking and and I'm like oh you should

45:58.000 --> 46:01.760
lead with that or not be confused about the ambiguous response because Chuck

46:01.760 --> 46:05.400
Barry would open with whatever he was stroking right so that then he can play

46:05.400 --> 46:10.240
the game of like I've got a little bell and I call it a dingaling now let's

46:10.240 --> 46:14.560
play fucking salty salted nuts or whatever the SNL sketch is not

46:14.560 --> 46:18.520
comedically sophisticated that sketch oh he's back for an eighth time

46:18.520 --> 46:25.520
salty balls what the fuck this is like a 1950s joke okay so just to me that line

46:25.520 --> 46:30.040
that we just heard changes changes the meaning of the past lines because he's

46:30.040 --> 46:33.400
saying all this stuff and it sounds braggartly but now he's telling this

46:33.400 --> 46:38.440
story and so it recontextualizes the early line such that it sounds like he's

46:38.440 --> 46:42.560
saying he's trying to come up with a way to relate to you he's like oh you ever

46:42.560 --> 46:48.360
have sex on a on a on a couch no no well what about in the backseat of the car

46:48.360 --> 46:53.000
okay okay well I was having sex on the backseat of the car and a guy came up

46:53.000 --> 46:57.320
and so so remember I said earlier that I was stroking well that was just like

46:57.320 --> 46:59.960
this one time while I was having sex in the back of the car and this guy comes

46:59.960 --> 47:03.720
up to me he says what are you doing I've been I've been stroking you know and now

47:03.720 --> 47:07.120
I just know to continue to explain this yeah it's also notable though that I

47:07.120 --> 47:10.000
don't think the cops said what are you doing I think he just shines the light

47:10.000 --> 47:15.760
and he goes I'm stroking guilty conscious guilty conscious can you go back and

47:15.760 --> 47:19.080
play that previous line okay I think it's important that we go back and

47:19.080 --> 47:38.040
recontextualize this guy is endeavoring to explain something serious

47:49.080 --> 48:02.060
I'm not sure my dick haven't even wet

48:02.060 --> 48:04.060
Okay.

48:04.060 --> 48:06.060
Let me ask you something.

48:06.060 --> 48:12.060
How long has it been since you made love?

48:12.060 --> 48:14.060
Huh?

48:14.060 --> 48:16.060
It's important to find out.

48:16.060 --> 48:18.060
Did you make love yesterday?

48:18.060 --> 48:20.060
I don't remember this part.

48:20.060 --> 48:24.060
Did you make love last week?

48:24.060 --> 48:26.060
He needs to get a baseline.

48:26.060 --> 48:28.060
Are you making love tomorrow?

48:28.060 --> 48:34.060
It's important for this next part I'm about to explain.

48:34.060 --> 48:40.060
Maybe it might be that you're planning on making love tonight.

48:40.060 --> 48:46.060
But just remember, when you start making love,

48:46.060 --> 48:54.060
you're making a hard, long, soft, short, and be stroking.

48:54.060 --> 48:56.060
Okay.

48:56.060 --> 48:58.060
I don't know how long I'll be.

48:58.060 --> 49:02.060
He said make it hard, long, soft, and short.

49:02.060 --> 49:04.060
Make it paradoxical.

49:04.060 --> 49:06.060
Sex should be challenging.

49:06.060 --> 49:08.060
Make it be a...

49:08.060 --> 49:12.060
Here comes the thing that I continue to twist.

49:12.060 --> 49:14.060
It's going to be really subtle.

49:14.060 --> 49:18.060
When I start making love to my woman,

49:18.060 --> 49:24.060
I don't stop until I know she's sex-ified.

49:24.060 --> 49:28.060
I always tell when she gets sex-ified.

49:28.060 --> 49:30.060
Because when she gets sex-ified,

49:30.060 --> 49:32.060
she started calling my name.

49:32.060 --> 49:34.060
She said,

49:34.060 --> 49:38.060
Clans caught, clans caught, clans caught, clans caught.

49:38.060 --> 49:42.060
That's smart branding.

49:42.060 --> 49:46.060
The other night, I was stroking my woman.

49:46.060 --> 49:48.060
The other night, I was stroking my woman.

49:48.060 --> 49:50.060
Okay, so now he's...

49:50.060 --> 49:52.060
So he was never talking about his cock.

49:52.060 --> 49:54.060
He's talking about being sensual.

49:54.060 --> 49:56.060
So now it makes sense that the cops come up

49:56.060 --> 49:58.060
and shine the light, and he goes,

49:58.060 --> 50:00.060
I'm fucking stroking, man.

50:00.060 --> 50:02.060
I have a civil right to do so.

50:02.060 --> 50:04.060
It's a stroke.

50:04.060 --> 50:06.060
I'm fucking touching someone's skin in a way that...

50:06.060 --> 50:08.060
No, he's talking about putting...

50:08.060 --> 50:10.060
He's talking about the stroke of the in and out of the dick.

50:10.060 --> 50:12.060
He just said stroking my woman.

50:12.060 --> 50:14.060
Are you saying you could use that,

50:14.060 --> 50:16.060
and it becomes kind of like stroking my woman

50:16.060 --> 50:18.060
means penetrating her?

50:18.060 --> 50:20.060
I think he's talking about fucking.

50:20.060 --> 50:22.060
Well, and I would say also,

50:22.060 --> 50:24.060
in contrast to my theory there,

50:24.060 --> 50:26.060
where I was like, oh, wait,

50:26.060 --> 50:28.060
the joke's on me for thinking

50:28.060 --> 50:30.060
he was talking about stroking his penis.

50:30.060 --> 50:32.060
But in his refrain,

50:32.060 --> 50:34.060
he says, I stroke it to the woman

50:34.060 --> 50:36.060
that I like best,

50:36.060 --> 50:38.060
which means not...

50:38.060 --> 50:40.060
It means...

50:40.060 --> 50:42.060
What are you stroking

50:42.060 --> 50:44.060
when you're stroking to something?

50:44.060 --> 50:46.060
You can't be stroking a piano to...

50:46.060 --> 50:48.060
Yeah, it's not a...

50:48.060 --> 50:50.060
It's not an intransitive verb.

50:54.060 --> 50:56.060
But I thought that was the twist,

50:56.060 --> 50:58.060
but his twist is just profane.

50:58.060 --> 51:00.060
And it got so good to her.

51:00.060 --> 51:02.060
You know what she told me.

51:02.060 --> 51:04.060
Let me tell you what she told me.

51:04.060 --> 51:06.060
She said,

51:06.060 --> 51:08.060
I stroke a clenched collar,

51:08.060 --> 51:10.060
but don't stroke so fast.

51:10.060 --> 51:12.060
If my stuff ain't tight enough,

51:12.060 --> 51:14.060
you can stick me up my...

51:14.060 --> 51:16.060
Well, I'd be slower.

51:16.060 --> 51:18.060
Okay, well...

51:18.060 --> 51:20.060
Damn.

51:20.060 --> 51:22.060
Is that a problem she was anticipating?

51:22.060 --> 51:24.060
The defense rests.

51:24.060 --> 51:26.060
Ha, ha, ha!

51:26.060 --> 51:28.060
Yeah, I...

51:28.060 --> 51:30.060
I mean, the case closed.

51:30.060 --> 51:32.060
If it's not...

51:32.060 --> 51:34.060
He's talking about fucking...

51:34.060 --> 51:36.060
He's talking about fucking a pussy,

51:36.060 --> 51:38.060
and then he goes, oh, also,

51:38.060 --> 51:40.060
if her stuff is too tight...

51:40.060 --> 51:42.060
If it's too tight, how is your ass looser?

51:42.060 --> 51:44.060
But then...

51:44.060 --> 51:46.060
What kind of woman are you

51:46.060 --> 51:48.060
bringing home with you, Clarence Carter?

51:48.060 --> 51:50.060
But then...

51:50.060 --> 51:52.060
If my vagina's too tight, there's always my ass.

51:52.060 --> 51:54.060
But then...

51:54.060 --> 51:56.060
What is that moment to get demure

51:56.060 --> 51:58.060
and not say the word ass?

51:58.060 --> 52:00.060
I know, well, because he's...

52:00.060 --> 52:02.060
That's the one thing that I'm thinking,

52:02.060 --> 52:04.060
like, you know what she said to me?

52:04.060 --> 52:06.060
He just sings the rest of it, and then he finishes the song.

52:06.060 --> 52:08.060
But, like, he might be thinking,

52:08.060 --> 52:10.060
like, you know what, and then I stop dating her,

52:10.060 --> 52:12.060
because I'm not doing that.

52:12.060 --> 52:14.060
Well, I be strokin'.

52:14.060 --> 52:16.060
I mean, like, a neck rub.

52:16.060 --> 52:18.060
Like, I'm like, I like to cuddle.

52:18.060 --> 52:20.060
But that's not the case.

52:20.060 --> 52:22.060
Anyways, well, that's the song strokin', babe.

52:22.060 --> 52:24.060
It's just good that he...

52:24.060 --> 52:26.060
When he gave that story,

52:26.060 --> 52:28.060
it's good that he found out how often

52:28.060 --> 52:30.060
we have sex and whether or not

52:30.060 --> 52:32.060
we've done it on a couch.

52:32.060 --> 52:34.060
Otherwise, how could we possibly have understood

52:34.060 --> 52:36.060
that when her stuff is too tight,

52:36.060 --> 52:38.060
we could do it there?

52:38.060 --> 52:40.060
You know what?

52:40.060 --> 52:42.060
What it's called...

52:42.060 --> 52:44.060
It wouldn't make any sense with all that buildup.

52:44.060 --> 52:46.060
It's called accusing the accuser.

52:46.060 --> 52:48.060
Oh, well, last time you had sex on a couch.

52:48.060 --> 52:50.060
Right. I didn't say you weren't strokin', buddy.

52:50.060 --> 52:52.060
Oh, really?

52:52.060 --> 52:54.060
When was the last time you had sex?

52:54.060 --> 52:56.060
I'm not saying you did it.

52:56.060 --> 52:58.060
Was it last night?

52:58.060 --> 53:00.060
That's not relevant.

53:00.060 --> 53:02.060
How is that a way to respond

53:02.060 --> 53:04.060
to police shining a light on you?

53:04.060 --> 53:06.060
I guess he's saying, like,

53:06.060 --> 53:08.060
you got a fucking problem? I'm strokin'.

53:08.060 --> 53:10.060
It's just him being defiant.

53:10.060 --> 53:12.060
He's going, like, why don't you take a picture

53:12.060 --> 53:14.060
of the last longer?

53:14.060 --> 53:16.060
I'm fucking strokin'.

53:16.060 --> 53:18.060
I'm not stealing. I'm not fucking...

53:18.060 --> 53:20.060
I'm not stealing his own.

53:20.060 --> 53:22.060
You very understandably took it to a place

53:22.060 --> 53:24.060
where if a guy starts talking about I be strokin',

53:24.060 --> 53:26.060
it sounds like he's masturbating.

53:26.060 --> 53:28.060
It turns out, no, he's...

53:28.060 --> 53:30.060
He just...

53:30.060 --> 53:32.060
He wants anal sex and is not getting it

53:32.060 --> 53:34.060
because the police are on his fucking ass.

53:34.060 --> 53:36.060
But also, like, is he just describing...

53:36.060 --> 53:38.060
He's just describing the...

53:38.060 --> 53:40.060
When I'm making love, I don't...

53:40.060 --> 53:42.060
It's not just making love. I have a special name for it.

53:42.060 --> 53:44.060
Oh, yeah. That's not a nice...

53:44.060 --> 53:46.060
I do it differently. I do it better.

53:46.060 --> 53:48.060
I call it strokin'.

53:48.060 --> 53:50.060
I'm not going to call it making love

53:50.060 --> 53:52.060
because you're a fucking plebe, okay?

53:52.060 --> 53:54.060
You make love like a fucking barn animal

53:54.060 --> 53:56.060
or a priest.

53:56.060 --> 53:58.060
I'm gonna...

53:58.060 --> 54:00.060
I'm a fucking hero when I make love.

54:00.060 --> 54:02.060
I'm a trademarkable fucking, like,

54:02.060 --> 54:04.060
brandy...

54:04.060 --> 54:06.060
Wait, sir? Sir?

54:06.060 --> 54:08.060
I'm shining my light on you. I'm strokin'.

54:08.060 --> 54:10.060
Why is there a...

54:10.060 --> 54:12.060
Why is there a compass

54:12.060 --> 54:14.060
on your penis right now?

54:14.060 --> 54:16.060
I have to ask this

54:16.060 --> 54:18.060
as a police officer.

54:18.060 --> 54:20.060
And I have to answer

54:20.060 --> 54:22.060
as a stroker.

54:22.060 --> 54:24.060
All right.

54:24.060 --> 54:26.060
And by asking...

54:26.060 --> 54:28.060
You've already answered some of my questions

54:28.060 --> 54:30.060
that I'll be asking later.

54:30.060 --> 54:32.060
Why is there a compass?

54:32.060 --> 54:34.060
I've never seen a compass.

54:34.060 --> 54:36.060
I've seen loads of things in my 15 years

54:36.060 --> 54:38.060
as a law enforcement officer.

54:38.060 --> 54:40.060
Ask this guy if he's ever done it on a couch.

54:40.060 --> 54:42.060
Hey.

54:42.060 --> 54:44.060
Thank you, Emily. I will.

54:44.060 --> 54:46.060
Officer?

54:46.060 --> 54:48.060
Have you ever made love?

54:48.060 --> 54:50.060
Hey, this will come into play later.

54:50.060 --> 54:52.060
Of course. What time have you made love?

54:52.060 --> 54:54.060
Answer my question. What to ask to answer mine?

54:54.060 --> 54:56.060
I pay your salary. What time have you made love?

54:56.060 --> 54:58.060
Ask him if he's playing on a bacon-loved tonight.

54:58.060 --> 55:00.060
Before breakfast? Have you made love before breakfast?

55:00.060 --> 55:02.060
Of course before breakfast. Okay, well, let me ask you this.

55:02.060 --> 55:04.060
All right.

55:04.060 --> 55:06.060
Have you done it during the late, late show?

55:06.060 --> 55:08.060
Why, sir?

55:08.060 --> 55:10.060
Sir, why is there a compass

55:10.060 --> 55:12.060
in your pitta with it?

55:12.060 --> 55:14.060
Because

55:14.060 --> 55:16.060
I stroke it to the east.

55:16.060 --> 55:18.060
Oh. I stroke it to the west.

55:18.060 --> 55:20.060
Okay, so that's how you can tell.

55:20.060 --> 55:22.060
And I stroke it to the woman

55:22.060 --> 55:24.060
that I love best. Okay, I'm not asking.

55:24.060 --> 55:26.060
That's what your flashlight is fucking penetrating.

55:26.060 --> 55:28.060
I'm not saying you're a bad person.

55:28.060 --> 55:30.060
I'm saying that this is a residential community

55:30.060 --> 55:32.060
where there are strict rules

55:32.060 --> 55:34.060
about people making love in their automobiles.

55:34.060 --> 55:36.060
Oh, do people live here? Yes.

55:36.060 --> 55:38.060
Well, do they live?

55:38.060 --> 55:40.060
Or do I live?

55:40.060 --> 55:42.060
Okay, wait, no.

55:42.060 --> 55:44.060
And am I not more alive than them?

55:44.060 --> 55:46.060
Who are you fucking Camu?

55:46.060 --> 55:48.060
I'm a fucking law officer.

55:48.060 --> 55:50.060
Never heard of him. Too busy stroking.

55:50.060 --> 55:52.060
Dropped out of high school to stroke.

55:52.060 --> 55:54.060
Wait, wait.

55:54.060 --> 55:56.060
No law against it. You're stroking what?

55:56.060 --> 55:58.060
The woman.

55:58.060 --> 56:00.060
To her. And also her.

56:00.060 --> 56:02.060
But that's not how verbs work.

56:02.060 --> 56:04.060
You can't stroke too.

56:04.060 --> 56:06.060
We didn't ask enough leading questions.

56:06.060 --> 56:08.060
I just want to know how

56:08.060 --> 56:10.060
how do you put a compass on your dick

56:10.060 --> 56:12.060
in the first place?

56:12.060 --> 56:14.060
You're so bad at geography

56:14.060 --> 56:16.060
that you can't just look at the moon

56:16.060 --> 56:18.060
and know when you're fucking to the east or the west

56:18.060 --> 56:20.060
that you have to have a compass on your dick.

56:20.060 --> 56:22.060
What kind of pagan shit is this?

56:22.060 --> 56:24.060
You know, if you're going to arrest me,

56:24.060 --> 56:26.060
am I under arrest?

56:26.060 --> 56:28.060
No.

56:28.060 --> 56:30.060
Thank you.

56:30.060 --> 56:32.060
You are not being detained.

56:32.060 --> 56:34.060
Everything you say right now can be used against you.

56:34.060 --> 56:36.060
I got your badge number.

56:36.060 --> 56:38.060
You're talking about moon fucking?

56:38.060 --> 56:40.060
Step out of the car.

56:40.060 --> 56:42.060
Gladly.

56:42.060 --> 56:44.060
You might want to step to the west a little bit.

56:44.060 --> 56:46.060
Why is that?

56:46.060 --> 56:48.060
Because I was on that stroke when you fucking

56:48.060 --> 56:50.060
interrupted me with your fascist fucking.

56:50.060 --> 56:52.060
Are you about to be stroking me?

56:52.060 --> 56:54.060
No, I'm just saying.

56:54.060 --> 56:56.060
I'm mid-stroke.

56:56.060 --> 56:58.060
Sir, if you threaten to stroke an officer,

56:58.060 --> 57:00.060
that's fine.

57:00.060 --> 57:02.060
I'm going to stroke you. I stroke the people I love best.

57:02.060 --> 57:04.060
Who might fucking chop liver?

57:04.060 --> 57:06.060
You don't love me at all?

57:06.060 --> 57:08.060
I'm cooperating here.

57:08.060 --> 57:10.060
There's nobody around.

57:10.060 --> 57:12.060
Why is it against the law for me to stroke?

57:12.060 --> 57:14.060
So you caused the problem.

57:14.060 --> 57:16.060
I don't understand.

57:16.060 --> 57:18.060
Nobody knows why you stroke.

57:18.060 --> 57:20.060
It sounds like you're jerking off.

57:20.060 --> 57:22.060
Did you seek me out because you had stroking questions?

57:22.060 --> 57:24.060
I was minding my own business.

57:26.060 --> 57:28.060
Maybe I've made love

57:28.060 --> 57:30.060
every way you could possibly do it.

57:30.060 --> 57:32.060
And I want to fucking find out if there's

57:32.060 --> 57:34.060
better ways to do it.

57:34.060 --> 57:36.060
I asked you some questions.

57:36.060 --> 57:38.060
I already know you've never stroked.

57:38.060 --> 57:40.060
I don't know what you call it, sir.

57:40.060 --> 57:42.060
I throw myself on your mercy.

57:42.060 --> 57:44.060
Emily, would you tell him

57:44.060 --> 57:46.060
that this is voluntary, consensual,

57:46.060 --> 57:48.060
so we can just get in the front seat of the car?

57:48.060 --> 57:50.060
So she has to tell me it's consensual?

57:50.060 --> 57:52.060
What?

57:52.060 --> 57:54.060
You're going to make her tell me

57:54.060 --> 57:56.060
that the stroking was consensual the whole time?

57:56.060 --> 57:58.060
I'm not going to make her do anything.

57:58.060 --> 58:00.060
I'm going to stroke to her

58:00.060 --> 58:02.060
while she talks to you.

58:02.060 --> 58:04.060
Nobody knows what that means.

58:04.060 --> 58:06.060
It sounds horrible.

58:06.060 --> 58:08.060
It sounds like an awful thing.

58:08.060 --> 58:10.060
Yeah, stroking sounds awful, yeah.

58:10.060 --> 58:12.060
Yeah, this fucking police state.

58:12.060 --> 58:14.060
It's like we're through the looking glass, man.

58:14.060 --> 58:16.060
Stroking is bad, but you know what's not?

58:16.060 --> 58:18.060
Vietnam.

58:18.060 --> 58:20.060
Put your hands in the car.

58:20.060 --> 58:22.060
Put your hands in the hood.

58:22.060 --> 58:24.060
I'm not resisting arrest.

58:24.060 --> 58:26.060
My name is Clarence Carter.

58:26.060 --> 58:28.060
Give me your right hand.

58:28.060 --> 58:30.060
Give me your right hand.

58:30.060 --> 58:32.060
Not your right.

58:32.060 --> 58:34.060
My east hand?

58:34.060 --> 58:36.060
Yes.

58:36.060 --> 58:38.060
Now put your west hand

58:38.060 --> 58:40.060
back there.

58:40.060 --> 58:42.060
I'm going to put the cuffs on you, sir.

58:42.060 --> 58:44.060
All right.

58:44.060 --> 58:46.060
And I'm going to be stroking.

58:46.060 --> 58:48.060
I'm going to be stroking to her.

58:48.060 --> 58:50.060
I'm going to be stroking to the south.

58:50.060 --> 58:52.060
Stroking to your butt

58:52.060 --> 58:54.060
and stroking to your mouth.

58:54.060 --> 58:56.060
I'm going to be stroking.

58:56.060 --> 58:58.060
Are you stroking to the north and south?

58:58.060 --> 59:00.060
Yeah, yeah.

59:00.060 --> 59:02.060
Also, who's going to believe you?

59:02.060 --> 59:04.060
There's no witnesses.

59:04.060 --> 59:06.060
Look, all I needed to know was that you stroked.

59:06.060 --> 59:08.060
I stroked to the north and the south.

59:08.060 --> 59:10.060
Fantastic.

59:10.060 --> 59:12.060
You stroked to the east and the west.

59:12.060 --> 59:14.060
That's why I was freaked out.

59:14.060 --> 59:16.060
I walk up in the car.

59:16.060 --> 59:18.060
I see somebody stroking east and west

59:18.060 --> 59:20.060
and that's confusing to me.

59:20.060 --> 59:22.060
I'm a north-south stroker.

59:22.060 --> 59:24.060
What's your ethnic background?

59:24.060 --> 59:26.060
Are you Norwegian?

59:26.060 --> 59:28.060
I'm Portuguese.

59:28.060 --> 59:30.060
It goes by lay lines, I've heard.

59:30.060 --> 59:32.060
My family's from the Azores

59:32.060 --> 59:34.060
and we're right on the...

59:34.060 --> 59:36.060
That makes total sense.

59:36.060 --> 59:38.060
I'm not trying to be racist.

59:38.060 --> 59:40.060
I'm American myself, but what I've been told

59:40.060 --> 59:42.060
is that there's different...

59:42.060 --> 59:44.060
It goes by magnetic lay lines.

59:44.060 --> 59:46.060
I'm going to uncuff you.

59:46.060 --> 59:48.060
Thank you so much.

59:48.060 --> 59:50.060
I'll just give you a warning on this one.

59:50.060 --> 59:52.060
Okay, I mean, I don't see why...

59:52.060 --> 59:54.060
I'm not going to...

59:56.060 --> 59:58.060
I don't understand why there has to be a rule

59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.060
just because that's how you stroke.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.060
You stroked east and west.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.060
You want to go up and down.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:06.060
North and south seems like a logical way to stroke.

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.060
No, you'd be stroking.

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.060
Huh.

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:12.060
I get it now.

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.060
I get what it's like to be

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.060
pontificated to about stroking.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.060
Can I be honest with you?

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.060
Can I give you one secret?

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.060
Can we walk away from the car

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.060
so Emily doesn't hear us?

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.060
I've...

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.060
I've never actually had sex before breakfast.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.060
Wow.

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.060
Well, it's like a bingo card.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.060
Eventually everybody fills it.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:38.060
It's not about...

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.060
What I'm trying to impart,

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.060
when I was grilling you about that,

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:44.060
it wasn't like, oh, do you do it...

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.060
Right, I was just saying,

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.060
can we share

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.060
the fact that we've stroked?

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.060
All right, anyways, all right.

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.060
Sorry.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.060
I'll let you go with a warning.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.060
Get out of here.

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.060
Drive home safely.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.060
Look, I gotta tell you,

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.060
if I ever see you up here again,

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.060
just keep it rolling.

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.060
Move along.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.060
Because I have a job to do.

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.060
You've got a job to do.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.060
What do you do? How do you make a living?

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.060
I'm a motivational speaker.

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.060
Really?

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.060
Yeah, mostly colleges and stuff.

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.060
Because I suffer from severe depression.

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.060
Oh, well, let me ask you this.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.060
Well, I already know the answer to what I was going to ask.

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.060
Don't diminish me by thinking

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.060
that you already know the answers to my...

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.060
Well, you know, when I eat,

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:40.060
when I eat,

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:42.060
I don't just eat.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.060
I eat gluten.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:46.060
You eat gluten.

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.060
Yeah, I eat gluten.

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:50.060
I eat gluten to the east.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.060
I go to...

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.060
When you eat, do you ever eat

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.060
before breakfast?

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.060
Wait, I do eat on the couch.

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:00.060
Yeah, you might have like a silly allergy.

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.060
The only time I'm ever happy

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:04.060
is eating on the couch.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.060
Yeah, and it's probably a bread-related product,

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:08.060
refined flour, all that stuff.

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:10.060
I eat gluten.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.060
Tell them about the time

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.060
you were gluten on the back seat of the car.

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.060
Emily!

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:18.060
And that cop came up.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.060
Has anybody ever...

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.060
I wonder in the history of police encounters,

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.060
when I wonder if anybody has ever

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.060
gotten

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.060
the offer of,

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:36.060
I'll let you off of the warning,

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:38.060
and been like,

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:40.060
No!

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.060
I don't accept your warning.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.060
You think that's got to be a thing?

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.060
You don't fucking warn me.

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:48.060
You pulled me over for a bullshit reason.

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.060
I don't accept your warning.

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.060
It's just a fucking thing we say when we're letting you go.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.060
I'm not going to be grateful for being let go.

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:56.060
I did that once.

01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:58.060
Like, fuck your warning.

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.060
I'm warning you.

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:04.060
Don't fucking pull me over ever again.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:06.060
Fucking cop...

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.060
I had the flu.

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:10.060
I was fucking just...

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:12.060
I was just rotten sick,

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.060
and I was going down to the market to get some juice,

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.060
like some healthy bits,

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.060
and the fucking cop pulled me over

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.060
because he thought I was on my phone.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.060
I wasn't on my phone,

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.060
and he pulled me over,

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.060
and I was just so fucking pissed off,

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:28.060
and he was like,

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.060
You can go.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.060
And I went, fuck you.

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.060
Dude! Dude!

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.060
I was laughing.

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:38.060
Ah!

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.060
And that...

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:44.060
That segment brought to you by white male privilege.

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.060
If I were a black guy,

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:48.060
I would be dead.

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.060
From the makers of voter suppression.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.060
Fuck that guy.

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:54.060
What a piece of shit.

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.060
Never got ticketed. He'd fucking lied.

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.060
He was a dick.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.060
He lied?

01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.060
If I were a brown or a woman,

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:04.060
absolutely.

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.060
Thank God.

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:08.060
Yeah, but you'd probably be allowed

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.060
to say Merry Christmas.

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:12.060
Man, okay.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.060
I'm just saying, listen to some of these YouTube links.

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.060
I'm fucking like, I'm not getting political.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.060
I'm just listening.

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.060
I never believed in the war on Christmas

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.060
until today. Yeah, Steve knows,

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.060
because I talked to him about it.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.060
But this is very serious, you guys.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:28.060
I saw the Reese's Christmas trees,

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.060
you know, the new ones,

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.060
and they don't have a stump.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.060
They have a point.

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.060
The same as the top point of the tree

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.060
and the same as the side points of the tree.

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.060
They have a bottom point

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.060
and not a stump,

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.060
and you can go through in the Google

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.060
and see the past Google

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:48.060
the Reese's Christmas trees,

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.060
and they have stumps because they're Christmas trees,

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.060
because it's Christmas, god damn it.

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.060
And it's a war on Christmas.

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.060
That's the only reason they would put a point

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.060
on the bottom.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.060
To make it like,

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.060
I'd starve David,

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:04.060
I don't know.

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.060
If you were breaking

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.060
the Christmas movie,

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.060
if you were breaking the story

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.060
for the Christmas sequel, for instance,

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.060
wouldn't you be bending

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:16.060
over backwards to try to figure out

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.060
how to have there be a war on Christmas?

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:20.060
Isn't Christmas,

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:22.060
if it has anything to do with Christ,

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.060
the guy who planted

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.060
all the Christmas trees,

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.060
in

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.060
4000 BC,

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:38.060
if it was truly about Christ

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.060
and there was a war on it,

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.060
doesn't that work better?

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.060
Isn't that more appropriate?

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:46.060
The man is famous

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:48.060
for being fucking murdered.

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:50.060
You wear a thing around

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:52.060
your neck of the guy dying.

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:54.060
He's getting his ass kicked

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.060
by the government.

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.060
That's what makes you Christian.

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:00.060
Be fucking proud of yourself.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.060
Like war on Christmas.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:04.060
You sound like a pussy.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.060
Meaning you sound like

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.060
you can do anything a penis can do.

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:10.060
Yeah. Nice save.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.060
Yes, I'm confusing. Nice save.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.060
But I'm safe.

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:16.060
You gotta see these Reese's trees.

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.060
I got all my bases covered.

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.060
But it's a...

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.060
I know,

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.060
we know everyone's dumb.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.060
It's just...

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:28.060
Has anyone ever...

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.060
Have you ever, for real,

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:32.060
honest to say already,

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.060
gage yourself?

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:36.060
How much in your brain

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:38.060
have you ever altered your...

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.060
If you were about to say Merry Christmas,

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.060
have you bothered to stop yourself?

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.060
How conscious are you of that

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:46.060
interplay?

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.060
I know who my non-Christian friends are.

01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.060
Jews, Arabs, whatever.

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.060
Like Delinial, whatever.

01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:54.060
Savedness.

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:56.060
Like...

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.060
Nobody is ever mad

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.060
about the words Merry Christmas.

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.060
Because Merry Christmas means

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.060
nothing. It means nothing!

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:06.060
Merry Christmas, why would I be

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.060
married? The guys of this poor kid

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:10.060
are gonna die before he's 40.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.060
He just got born in a barn.

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.060
He's got... There's an ox

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.060
there and he got

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.060
some shit that no kid would ever want.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.060
And there's three dudes from

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.060
the fucking Orients that come over there

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:26.060
and bring him the worst...

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:28.060
The worst gifts ever and the supposed

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.060
best person.

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.060
What baby doesn't want myrrh?

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.060
Thank God the little drummer boys

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:36.060
here. Every baby shower

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:38.060
I go to, I make sure to bring

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.060
an unguence.

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.060
Do you know why the baby

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.060
Jesus smiles at the end of the

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.060
little drummer boy song? He's like,

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.060
get away! Leave me alone!

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:50.060
I'm...

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.060
My brain is gelatin.

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.060
I can't... I can't lift cake

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:56.060
to my mouth yet.

01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.060
I'm just... They call it...

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.060
They call it an

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.060
in. It's not a fucking in.

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:04.060
There's no room at the end.

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:06.060
There's not even an in. It's a fucking

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:08.060
shack. It's a barn outside.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.060
Well, wait. No, there's no room at the...

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.060
There's no room at the end. No, there's not

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.060
even an in. That's why they're in the barn.

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.060
There's a second in on the grassy

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:18.060
knoll. Oh, you're saying, you're saying

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.060
the in probably sucked. There was

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.060
no in. There was no in. There was never an in.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:24.060
Do you think that in...

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.060
Well, I didn't know we were...

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.060
There was no in?

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.060
No, they added that. Wouldn't that in

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.060
be the most famous in the world?

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:34.060
That was all... Here's another thing.

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.060
Did you know that

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.060
fucking...

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.060
lumber does not burn at the temperature

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.060
of a...

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.060
I was like, the in is building

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:46.060
seven. I don't know.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.060
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.060
It was an inside job. There was no in.

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.060
It was. There was no in.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.060
Also,

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.060
majors...

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.060
Have you gone on a major gate?

01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:00.060
Ha, ha, ha.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.060
Who's the guy that's the most excited

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.060
about the true story of Christ?

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.060
Mel Gibson, the movie he made. What's that

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.060
movie? It's 90% fucking

01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.060
getting your ass kicked.

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.060
It's like underdog shit.

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:16.060
So why are you so mad?

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.060
Oh, boy.

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.060
Oh, boy. Macy's is not

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.060
allowed to fucking roll out a red

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.060
carpet for the naked man that I

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.060
worship for demonstrating to me that you

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.060
should never be fucking afraid. You should

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.060
hang out and love people and if they kill

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.060
you, they fucking kill you because that's the

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.060
currency. I just don't get these people.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.060
Merry Christmas

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:40.060
to me, Dan Harmon, sarcastically.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:42.060
She's going to take a shit. She's not mad.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.060
It's cool.

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.060
It's impossible that this is offensive to

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.060
anyone.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.060
There's no way

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:54.060
this is controversial at all.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.060
When I went to India, maybe I've already spoken

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.060
about this, when church and I were in India,

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.060
there was Christmas decorations everywhere

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.060
and this is during Christmas

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.060
and they fucking worship

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:06.060
every festival and it was

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.060
so magical. There was Santa Clauses

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.060
and Christmas trees and

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:12.060
tinsel everywhere. Oh, in India, right.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.060
Because you said they have so many festivals.

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:16.060
And they said,

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:18.060
to us, it's the festival of giving

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.060
and lights

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:22.060
and we're like, oh, back in our hometown

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.060
church said hilariously, she goes

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.060
back in America

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.060
there's a war on Christmas, apparently

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.060
India won because

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.060
they celebrate

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.060
the festival of gifts

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:36.060
and the festival of lights

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.060
and the festival of everybody being

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.060
like on the same team.

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.060
People all dress up as Santa Claus

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:44.060
and all give each other gifts. Everybody

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.060
Santa, everybody is the child.

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:48.060
You characterize India, it almost sounded like

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.060
as far as their civic

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.060
observation of

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:54.060
other religions

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:56.060
and things that they're kind of like following

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.060
the, well, it's happy hour somewhere

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.060
kind of like, which is not, I don't

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.060
mean to mischaracterize, I don't want to get your letters

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:04.060
like I have a mailbox, but you know

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.060
India is a really unfair place to blah, blah, blah.

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:08.060
I'm just saying in terms of their municipality

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.060
you said they're kind of like

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:12.060
I don't know how you phrase it.

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.060
They speak a million languages

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:16.060
they

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:18.060
obey or observe

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.060
100 religions, they're very

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:22.060
heterodoxic and... Heterodoxic.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.060
I'm stealing it, what does it mean?

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.060
Heterodoxy.

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:28.060
Give it to me.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:30.060
Let me fucking sound smart.

01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:32.060
I want to know what it means. If it means

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.060
pickles, I don't want to accidentally use it.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.060
It means like the other, like

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:38.060
heterosexual, like the other.

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.060
Like, oh, like, oh,

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:42.060
what's the last part? Doxic, what is it?

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.060
Heterodoxy.

01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:46.060
Doxy, oh, doxy like, okay.

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.060
Stacy Schiff

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.060
who wrote a great

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:52.060
biography of Cleopatra said that

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.060
Alexandria

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.060
bustled with heterodoxy.

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.060
Compatibility, like

01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:00.060
the opposite of xenophobia, like

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:02.060
saying, hey, if you're going to be big...

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.060
You can be Jewish, you can be Islamic, you can do whatever the fuck

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.060
and nobody fucking cares.

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.060
Like Taoism, like Eastern religions are heterodoxic

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.060
and they're like, go ahead, be Christian.

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:12.060
Never heard of them, like fucking bring them in.

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.060
Whatever, like, what did he say?

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.060
Did he say you can't be Taoist?

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:18.060
I can't find it in the rule book. Alright, then he's

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:20.060
allowed in.

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.060
However, forgive our listeners if I've ever

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:24.060
from repeating myself,

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.060
our driver, I asked her,

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.060
so you celebrate every festival

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.060
and she goes, yeah, I go...

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:32.060
Jewish festivals? She goes, nah.

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:34.060
Nah.

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.060
Meh.

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.060
But it wasn't because of, I don't think it's because of anti-Semitism.

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:40.060
I think she's like, it's,

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:42.060
their stuff is really for them.

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.060
Like, it's like, you don't get to, like, kind of just...

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.060
That sounds like anti-Semitism.

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:48.060
That's exactly

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.060
what Germans say.

01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:52.060
Their stuff is really for them. Let's get them.

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:54.060
I don't

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.060
like this boys' club stuff.

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:58.060
What if we were proud of our bloodline?

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.060
Yeah.

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:02.060
You got me.

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.060
Oh, I can't believe how proud I was getting.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.060
Yeah.

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.060
I don't know.

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:10.060
It's a mixed bag and I think that

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:12.060
the more heterodoxical, if I'm making

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:14.060
a word up, I don't care.

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:16.060
Invariance with the accepted

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.060
or official traditional

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.060
religion.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.060
I'm wondering about the subject.

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:24.060
Doxical.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.060
Paradoxical. What's dox?

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:28.060
What does that mean?

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.060
Belief system.

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.060
Orthodoxy.

01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:34.060
Culture.

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:36.060
What else ends in dox?

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:38.060
Belief system.

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:40.060
Listen to the History of English podcast.

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.060
It's so great.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.060
It makes you feel so dumb,

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.060
but you can just listen to it over and over again.

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:48.060
Okay, I got 1% of that in my brain.

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.060
Crazy.

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:52.060
Okay.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.060
I've Googled heterodoxy in a religious sense.

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.060
It means any opinions or doctrines

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:58.060
that variance with an official or orthodox position.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:00.060
Under this definition,

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.060
heterodoxy is similar to unorthodoxy.

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:04.060
While the adjective

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:06.060
heterodox could be applied

01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:08.060
to a dissident.

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.060
Well, yeah.

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:12.060
When I read that word, I mean, maybe I'm getting it all wrong,

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:14.060
but when I read that word, I took it to mean

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:16.060
the idea that other things are happening

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.060
at once.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:20.060
It's the precursor to sometimes

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.060
fascist slides.

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.060
From what I understand,

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.060
whether there's

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.060
economic instability

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.060
or not, it's basically

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:32.060
when there's technologically assisted

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:34.060
kind of cultural upheaval where it starts

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.060
to feel like there's gridlock happening

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:38.060
and there's horns honking.

01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:40.060
The older folk,

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.060
they do what we've seen them do,

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:44.060
which is to start to go,

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:46.060
like this when I was a kid,

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:48.060
honk, honk, honk,

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:50.060
and then anybody

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:52.060
who starts walking down that crowded sidewalk

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:54.060
with a sandwich board that goes like,

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:56.060
who loves Hitler?

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.060
Even though they were yesterday

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.060
because they were able to get to work on time

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.060
and weren't being embarrassed

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:04.060
more than five times a year

01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:06.060
about their foot-and-mouth moments

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:08.060
of like, oh, I guess I didn't know everything.

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:10.060
When that hits six times a year or more,

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:12.060
it's multiculturalism.

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:14.060
It's like the potting soil

01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:16.060
for, you know, fascist

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.060
to like, impulse.

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:20.060
You can live in a culture

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:22.060
and believe something other than the

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.060
Orthodox ideal of

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.060
that culture, and that'd be all right.

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:28.060
I mean, because when's that ever paid off

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:30.060
for any country?

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:32.060
Cha-ching?

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.060
When did we ever get the impression

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:36.060
that like, oh,

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.060
slippery slope letting these

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.060
foreigners like

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:42.060
in like, are you fucking kidding me?

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:44.060
You fucking, all

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:46.060
pieces of shit.

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:48.060
You fucking like, grandsons

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.060
of fucking yokels from some

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.060
fucking European country that were

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.060
getting their asses kicked.

01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:56.060
Going around touring the country doing comedy shows

01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.060
and driving through America

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:00.060
and the moment you get

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.060
a bit outside of

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.060
kind of the major cultural hubs like

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:06.060
colleges and, you know, major cities,

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:08.060
Confederate flags

01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:10.060
waving and like, what?

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.060
Like, you weren't even

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:14.060
a boo

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:16.060
to

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.060
you weren't a slave state Ohio

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.060
or fucking Minnesota.

01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:22.060
You weren't even in the fucking

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:24.060
fight in the fucking thing.

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:26.060
And that flag is just

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:28.060
simply a signal saying keep moving

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:30.060
if you're not

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.060
a white asshole.

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:34.060
And I can't, like,

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:36.060
I love traveling the country.

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:38.060
I love performing around the country and I don't mean

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:40.060
to talk shit about any particular

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.060
cities in general, but it's like

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:44.060
you waving your flag

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:46.060
of obvious bigotry

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.060
is

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.060
crazy. Yeah. And if you're in Ohio

01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:52.060
then you're saying your frustration is

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:54.060
you're going, god damn it, that's the next door to me

01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.060
and I can't, there's no flag I can put out

01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.060
I can't put out a United Nations flag.

01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:00.060
I can't do it. There's no flag.

01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.060
Although in my place I have a huge Brexit flag

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.060
outside my place right now.

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:06.060
There's a flag that says like I'm fucking

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.060
down to clown.

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:10.060
Like a real American

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:12.060
always has been.

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:14.060
What would the flag, how would you design

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:16.060
the down to clown flag?

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:18.060
Would it have a flag on it?

01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:20.060
How would you do down to clown flag?

01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:22.060
I don't know, man. I'm not

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:24.060
in the mood to joke about it. It gets me

01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:26.060
uncharismatic to talk about it.

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.060
I just so like, I've said it a thousand

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.060
times and like, first of all

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.060
I am the grandchild

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.060
of fucking women that are

01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.060
covered in crazy Eastern European

01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:38.060
warts and speak with accents.

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:40.060
Like I can't, this country is so young.

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:42.060
Like I am the whitest guy

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:44.060
in this room and I am

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.060
a stone's throw from

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.060
immigration.

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:50.060
And not people who came over here

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:52.060
and cleared the fucking

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:54.060
list of like, Will are you

01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:56.060
here to make us rich? No, I'm here

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.060
to fucking hide. I'm here to fucking

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.060
run. I'm here because I

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:02.060
will die. I jumped out

01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:04.060
the window of the skyscraper

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:06.060
of my burning country and I'm landing

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:08.060
here. I don't, I need

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:10.060
somewhere to stay.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.060
We made that big business.

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:14.060
I don't, like, how can

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.060
people be so fucking rude

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:18.060
and mean and hypocritical?

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.060
And when the answer is

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:22.060
well, because they don't understand

01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:24.060
and you're hurting their feelings because

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.060
it sucks to be

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.060
made fun of for being stupid.

01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:30.060
I want to fucking boo who.

01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:32.060
Like, what do you mean?

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.060
Like, read a book.

01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:36.060
I just get so

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.060
fucking mad about it because I'm like,

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.060
like, when did we,

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.060
how did we get so fucking

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:44.060
dumb? Like, why are we,

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.060
whatever. That's the

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.060
evolution of empires

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:50.060
is that we always just

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.060
you crest and you fall

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:54.060
and we're doing a very

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.060
predictable fall

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:58.060
but we didn't get anywhere near

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.060
the crest. We fucking

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.060
we, all we did was

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.060
accidentally

01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:06.060
stumble into

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.060
the internet age.

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:10.060
Because of the

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:12.060
culture that we created over here

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:14.060
for better or for worse, of

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:16.060
like, we were like

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:18.060
hey man, capitalism,

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.060
poker chips, like keep

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:22.060
you have your religion, have your cookbooks,

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.060
have your fucking

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.060
politics, like

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.060
we're never going to knock on your door

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:30.060
and check up on you, do what you do,

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.060
pay your taxes, like it's a big

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.060
experiment over here and

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.060
if there was, like

01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:38.060
it's not a controversial statement to say we

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.060
invented the internet, is it?

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.060
Is there someone from

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:44.060
Scotland, you got your friend from Scotland here?

01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:46.060
I don't, I'd like, because I know if you say like

01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.060
we invented the automobile. Oh by the way, can we give a

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.060
shout out, this motherfucker Colin

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:52.060
came all the way from Glasgow, Scotland to come see

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:54.060
us last week.

01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:56.060
Oh damn. Colin,

01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:58.060
did you invent the internet?

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.060
No, steam engine

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.060
I think you got right. They invented it together.

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:04.060
And the headbutt.

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:06.060
Fucking own it, you invented the headbutt. He helped.

01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:10.060
Is it a Scottish,

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.060
is it a Scottish,

01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:14.060
I listened to that podcast

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:16.060
The Illusionist and it's like about like

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:18.060
language. Yeah, language.

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:20.060
And it was talking about like how the

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.060
Scots are like so bullied, like

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.060
linguistically, like throughout. Colin jump on stage

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:26.060
so we can see him grab a microphone. Do you want to come up?

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:28.060
If you want to come up, come up and share.

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.060
We don't get to hear Scottish people.

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.060
He traveled a mighty long way. Oh I get to sit down then.

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:34.060
Thank God.

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:36.060
Oh, we have a guest I can sit down.

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:38.060
Yeah, you've been standing for a while.

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:40.060
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:42.060
Please. Here, give me that, that was

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.060
on my phone. Dan needs that. Thank you.

01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.060
For later.

01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:48.060
You want a drink? Is everybody there?

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.060
I reload you. There will be.

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:52.060
This is going to be production

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:54.060
value, just your accent. We don't get to hear Scottish

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.060
people enough. Well, that's what I was saying.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.060
Jeff, I've been doing my best

01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:00.060
to hide my Glaswegian.

01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:02.060
You're from Glasgow, right?

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:04.060
Yeah.

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:06.060
Yeah.

01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:08.060
But you said originally you're from this place called

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:10.060
the Clay Bank? Oh, I'm from Clay Bank, yeah.

01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:12.060
Woo.

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:14.060
And they're famous, nobody

01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:16.060
from Clay Bank?

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:18.060
Yeah.

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:20.060
The Clay Banks claim to fame.

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:22.060
There's like memorials there and stuff because

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:24.060
they were targeted intensely by Nazi bombings.

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.060
We, well,

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.060
we're very good at making,

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:30.060
well, we had

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:32.060
singer sewing machines.

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:34.060
Someone here may know that.

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:36.060
Or in that we had John Brown shipyards

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:38.060
and we made, yeah, we made ships

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.060
that helped fight the Nazis.

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:42.060
So you were a war target because of the

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.060
shipbuilding and the sewing machines

01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:46.060
or fabric and... Maybe not the sewing machines,

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:48.060
but definitely.

01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:50.060
But when you think that there would be like

01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.060
uniforms and sails.

01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:54.060
Oh, yeah.

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.060
They came after us because of the shipbuilding.

01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:58.060
They fucked us up.

01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:00.060
Now,

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:02.060
if you talk to somebody from Edinburgh,

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:04.060
in my experience, Colin, you talk to someone

01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:06.060
from Edinburgh and they call it a headbutt,

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.060
they call it a Glasgow kiss.

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:10.060
Do you call it a Glasgow kiss or do you call

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:12.060
it something else? I call it fucking sore.

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.060
You call it what?

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:16.060
Fucking sore.

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:18.060
Now I'm scared.

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:20.060
Now I'm terrified.

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:22.060
Yeah, I listen to this

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:24.060
podcast about the British

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.060
kind of like

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:28.060
treatment of the...

01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:30.060
It's like being Scottish

01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:32.060
in

01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.060
a British Empire and

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:36.060
how that has functioned throughout history

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.060
in particularly the language.

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:40.060
And

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:42.060
Americans like... I'll just speak for myself.

01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:44.060
Really not that familiar with it at all.

01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:46.060
I'm just familiar with it enough to know

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:48.060
that there's basically a

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:50.060
Scottish language that I would not

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:52.060
understand at all

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:54.060
because it's not...

01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.060
And then it's like there's a Scottish

01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:58.060
dialect

01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.060
that makes English its own thing.

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:02.060
And then as

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.060
school kids,

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.060
even if you're going...

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.060
Because I'm not sure I got this right.

01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:10.060
Even if you're going to school

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.060
in Scotland,

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:14.060
are you kind of shamed

01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:16.060
for the jargon?

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.060
I think the closest possible metaphor

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:20.060
we would have in America is the

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:22.060
Ibonic thing.

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:24.060
When we had this thing, we had a word for it,

01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:26.060
and people were like, how dare you?

01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:28.060
And then it was like...

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:30.060
But that may be a really offensive

01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.060
analog for either side.

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:34.060
Colin, you said that you are

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:36.060
a Scottish language speaker, right?

01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.060
Yeah, me and my grandest from

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.060
Donegal.

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:42.060
How much of your upbringing

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:44.060
did you actually speak Scots or Scots-Irish?

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:46.060
I've never

01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:48.060
spoke proper

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:50.060
Scottish-Gaelic.

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.060
So it's like...

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.060
It's like Irish-Gaelic, Scottish-Gaelic.

01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:56.060
I don't really know Scottish-Gaelic.

01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:58.060
I know when I've had a few drinks

01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:00.060
and I've been there for a scone game.

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:02.060
I can murmur my way through it.

01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:04.060
Would you know it in English

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:06.060
or would you know it in Scots?

01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:08.060
I'd probably do very well with Scots.

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.060
But

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.060
one of the main things I can remember

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.060
from my grand and you both,

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:16.060
he was from Donegal

01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:18.060
and nice as best guy in the world

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:20.060
ever.

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:22.060
He went to a shop with my brothers

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:24.060
and

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.060
the shopkeeper was

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:28.060
foreign.

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:30.060
And he was speaking a different

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:32.060
language to someone else.

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:34.060
So he was dealing with

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:36.060
my grand and he found that really offensive.

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:38.060
So he refused to speak

01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:40.060
English or Scottish

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.060
to this person

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:44.060
until they acknowledged him in Scots.

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:46.060
So all he did was just speak Scottish-Gaelic.

01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:48.060
Really?

01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:50.060
And it lasted from what my brother said.

01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:52.060
Quite a while.

01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:54.060
Intentionally speaking to my brother

01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:56.060
in Scottish-Gaelic until this person would then go,

01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:58.060
Oh, sorry.

01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:00.060
I wish

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:02.060
racism is one of the great racisms

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.060
of all time.

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:06.060
I'm sure it's a

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.060
a Glaswegian comedian. I think it was Frankie Boyle

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:10.060
who said that the Irish invented

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.060
sectarianism in Scotland perfected it.

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.060
I'm pretty sure it is.

01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:16.060
Who said it was correct?

01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:18.060
Oh, it was my ex-wife because my ex-wife is Irish

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.060
now. She lives in Ireland.

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:22.060
And

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:24.060
I referred

01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:26.060
to the whole

01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:28.060
fucking

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:30.060
banana bowl as the UK

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:32.060
and she's like, first of all, Ireland is not the UK

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:34.060
and I was like, oh, yeah.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.060
But then she was like,

01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:38.060
well, half of it is

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:40.060
and that's the source of a bunch of

01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:42.060
and I'm like, alright, so it's not that big a misunderstanding.

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:44.060
One core, maybe.

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:46.060
But Scotland is,

01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.060
we were in Scotland and we spent a lot of time

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:50.060
because they were having an election that was coming up

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:52.060
about the possible secession

01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:54.060
and that didn't go through.

01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:56.060
It didn't, but I think

01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:58.060
Brexit may help.

01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.060
Were you pro-independence or?

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.060
Yeah, I was pro-independence.

01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:04.060
It's incredible.

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:06.060
And if you guys

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.060
had made it, you would have had

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.060
and one day

01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:12.060
I think Scotland will be independent

01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:14.060
and you will have the best

01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:16.060
national anthem of all time because

01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.060
Flower of Scotland is fucking cool.

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:20.060
Flower of Scotland is fucking amazing. Sing a bit for us.

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.060
I'll be happy to.

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:24.060
When

01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:26.060
she bloom

01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:28.060
she bloom like

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:30.060
Flowers of Scotland

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:32.060
from

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:34.060
the pipes, the pipes

01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:36.060
they blow for

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:38.060
me

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.060
gardens

01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:42.060
and the dragons

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:44.060
may be name

01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:46.060
ice and the mice may be

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:48.060
dragon men

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:50.060
but I long

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.060
for flowers

01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:54.060
of Scotland

01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:56.060
and I

01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:58.060
hit

01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.060
my wife again.

01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:02.060
Oh, he drooled.

01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:04.060
I just started thinking of

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.060
Sean Connery right at the end there.

01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:08.060
Somebody told me

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.060
Sean Connery in like a 60 minutes interview

01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.060
like the interviewer was like

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.060
you said at one point it's okay to slap a woman

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:16.060
if she disagrees with anything

01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:18.060
he's like I stunned by it.

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:20.060
Wow.

01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:22.060
It was an awesome like

01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:24.060
sometimes you need to know

01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:26.060
what's what.

01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:28.060
What did he say

01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:30.060
they're like what do you think

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.060
and this is obviously something that must be

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.060
before 1989

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:36.060
that's an interview happened but he was like

01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:38.060
his explanation was

01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:40.060
if you have a fight

01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:42.060
and you've already won

01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:44.060
the man's won and then she keeps

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:46.060
going.

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.060
Now it must be nice

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.060
to live in a world where fights are won

01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.060
ever.

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:54.060
Holy crap.

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.060
In the context of the 60 minutes piece

01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:58.060
or whatever they're like but here's the thing

01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:00.060
happily married for 27 years

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:02.060
they're like hey think about it

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:04.060
maybe you should try it at home

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.060
and all the women in the

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.060
writers room are talking about

01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.060
happily

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.060
where's the 60 minutes piece on his wife

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.060
anyways

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:16.060
so that's why I threw that

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:18.060
in the national anthem.

01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:20.060
If you ever see a rugby match

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:22.060
or whatever

01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:24.060
and

01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:26.060
the crowd sings

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.060
acapella.

01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:30.060
Sorry that's just me being a bit

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:32.060
awful.

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.060
If you ever hear the crowd acapella sing

01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:36.060
it's beautiful.

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.060
Yeah I go to every

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:40.060
part of the Tartan army

01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:42.060
every fucking game you sing

01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:44.060
and then you get your heart broken

01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:46.060
because some Belgium guy just scored

01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:48.060
a fucking screamer from absolutely

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:50.060
about it

01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:52.060
and then you go for a couple of pints

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:54.060
and you go yeah well I mean

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:56.060
one of my favorite

01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.060
when Trump got elected

01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:00.060
one of my favorite protest photos

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:02.060
when he did the Arab

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:04.060
ban or tried to do that

01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:06.060
there was a Scottish

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:08.060
woman holding up a poster that said

01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:10.060
a free air name but I know exactly

01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:12.060
she said your mother was an immigrant

01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.060
you absolute roaster

01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:16.060
roaster

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.060
I don't even know what a roaster means

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:20.060
but it's fucking it sounds like a joke

01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:22.060
roaster is just kind of

01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:24.060
and what about your fucking continuing supply

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:26.060
of mail order Brian are you fucking

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:28.060
kidding me

01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:30.060
oh yeah I hate

01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:32.060
I don't remember this

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:34.060
I must have missed this one

01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:36.060
again it's like I'm not charismatic

01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:38.060
when I give a shit about this

01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:40.060
it's amazing

01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:42.060
when will we see

01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:44.060
your likes again

01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:46.060
it's fucking good

01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:48.060
that fought and died

01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:50.060
for who

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.060
your wee bit hell

01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:54.060
and glennon stood against

01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:56.060
I bet who

01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:58.060
voted

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:00.060
for that

01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.060
stroking on

01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.060
the glennon

01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:06.060
if it makes you feel better

01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:08.060
I was about to show you

01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:10.060
I've been we stroking

01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:12.060
I'm not we stroking

01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:14.060
normally after you see

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:16.060
fucking proud edwards army

01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:18.060
if you're independent

01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:20.060
you show you wanker

01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:22.060
you want to hear the

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:24.060
phrase that they taught me in milwaukee

01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:26.060
comedy sports when we had our accent workshop

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:28.060
I would love to

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:30.060
I'll start with a couple others

01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:32.060
for irish

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.060
because they got

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:36.060
we're gonna give you a crash course

01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:38.060
45 minutes we're gonna teach you 20 accents

01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:40.060
so we're gonna teach you one line

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:42.060
from each accent that if you say it

01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:44.060
maybe you can maybe do the accent

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:46.060
it hooks you into it

01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:48.060
it's like if you want to do george bush

01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:50.060
now I'm ready

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:52.060
go for it

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:54.060
he just died

01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:56.060
amazing president

01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:58.060
but for irish

01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:00.060
they go like keep it in the back of your teeth

01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:04.060
you think you love me but you don't

01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:06.060
is that everything's like breathy

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.060
you think you love me but you don't

01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:10.060
and then scottish was

01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.060
it's a great great day

01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:14.060
for muta car racing

01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.060
motor car racing

01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:18.060
and we would always

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:20.060
the only thing we did it was like

01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:22.060
it was like okay now we're

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.060
accent experts and we're like

01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:26.060
can we get an accent scottish

01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:28.060
and everybody in the scene would just come in

01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:30.060
it's a great great day for muta car racing

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:32.060
yes it is a great day

01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:34.060
is that jackie's turn

01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:36.060
I thought you were gonna do the

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:38.060
Sean Connery mosh things down here

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.060
don't react well to muta car racing

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.060
and if they don't react well

01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:48.060
I'm fine with it but if they're women

01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:50.060
you give them a slap

01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:56.060
sometimes you need it

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:04.060
that's him in Highlander

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:06.060
I think Colin a song really

01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:08.060
you didn't even quite know

01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:10.060
cause I belong to Glasgow

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:12.060
I think it was

01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:16.060
is it Jerry Rafferty

01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:18.060
I think it might have been Jerry Rafferty

01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:20.060
someone's gonna be here in this from Scotland

01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:22.060
I've been with a few of my cronies

01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.060
one or two pals of mine

01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:26.060
we went into a hotel

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:28.060
we did very well

01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:30.060
to us cunt confetti

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.060
did you call me a cunt fettie

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:40.060
why would you just fucking call me a cunt

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:42.060
we're actually

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:44.060
we can't care

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:46.060
I just never know because I've been warned

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.060
because

01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:50.060
is that what they call

01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:52.060
that's adorable but probably

01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:56.060
I can make it absolutely

01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:58.060
I couldn't say you can make it cure

01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:00.060
people from clay bank called bankies

01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:02.060
bankies

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:04.060
which also kind of seems like

01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:06.060
it's ever a fault for the fucking crisis

01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:08.060
but oh so

01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:14.060
are you supposed to say Glasgow or Glasgow

01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:16.060
sorry

01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:18.060
is there such a thing as an upper class

01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:20.060
glass

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:22.060
region

01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:24.060
mostly there in the west end

01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:26.060
which is where I currently work

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.060
how big is it compared

01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:30.060
can you think of an American city

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:32.060
do you know populations of American cities

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:34.060
can you say like it's big as Houston

01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:36.060
of course you can, that's what they do in Scotland

01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:38.060
they sit around in the San Francisco

01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:40.060
study populations of American cities

01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.060
it's definitely tiny

01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.060
apparently

01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:46.060
well

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:48.060
I'd say we're quite small

01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:50.060
but like you were saying with

01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:52.060
the

01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:54.060
the dialect

01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:56.060
I think quite a lot of it comes from

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:58.060
like you're also deciding it's about the posh people

01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:00.060
I work in the west

01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:02.060
ish

01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:04.060
and

01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:06.060
if I spoke how well

01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:08.060
I speak like this I know to use

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.060
and that's how I speak to them but if I spoke normally

01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:12.060
I absolutely have no fucking idea

01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:14.060
what the fuck I was saying

01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:16.060
nobody tell them

01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:18.060
I would not have a job

01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:24.060
you think you sound like Tom Brocaw

01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:26.060
right now

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:28.060
but

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:30.060
you're saying like you're making an effort

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:32.060
to be like

01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:34.060
okay I'm talking to Americans

01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:36.060
but it's the same there

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.060
this is the same effort for them

01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:40.060
if your family called you up

01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:42.060
or you got in a fight with somebody

01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:44.060
this is not how I speak

01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:46.060
give us the thickest brogue

01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:48.060
that you got

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:52.060
to an impression of your least favorite relative

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:54.060
I'll be an American

01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:56.060
ringing your doorbell and asking for directions

01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:58.060
bing bong

01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:00.060
do your doors go bing bong

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:02.060
or are they like

01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:04.060
bing

01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:06.060
bing

01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:08.060
all proud of Scotland

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:12.060
it's more

01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:14.060
later from America

01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:16.060
I don't know

01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:18.060
their doorbells are big pipes

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:20.060
yeah yeah

01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:22.060
we don't have doorbells

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:24.060
your doorbibes

01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:26.060
he's doing it

01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:28.060
oh shit

01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:30.060
we're fucking it up

01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:32.060
I can't do it

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:34.060
ask him a question

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:36.060
play ball here

01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:38.060

the brown sauce they put on the

01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:20.060
fucking bacon buddy or the

01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:22.060
the chip buddy

01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.060
it's the greasiest thing I've ever had in my life

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:26.060
depends

01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:28.060
I'm pretty sure

01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:30.060
I've suddenly stopped talking a wee bit

01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:32.060
no it's good

01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:34.060
I think the brown sauce

01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:36.060
is normal it's just red sauce

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:38.060
but it's also

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:40.060
a point

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.060
so if you're in Glasgow and you speak

01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:44.060
kind of normal it's a red sauce

01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:46.060
but not brown sauce

01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:48.060
and if you

01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:50.060
go somewhere fancy it's

01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:52.060
oh I can have some ketchup

01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:54.060
that's when you know you're

01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:56.060
I had a fucking

01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.060
have you ever had a bacon buddy

01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:00.060
it's just fucking

01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:02.060
french fries on a roll

01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:04.060
that's it

01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:06.060
there's no bacon buddy

01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:08.060
a chip buddy is just chips

01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.060
it's a roll

01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:12.060
and bacon

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.060
Dan and I were in

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:16.060
it was freezing tits we were there during

01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:18.060
New Year's Eve

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:20.060
and we had a fucking

01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:22.060
a deep fried Mars bar

01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:24.060
it was fucking good

01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:26.060
hey it's me

01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:28.060
that's the fucking oldest

01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:30.060
thing we've ever had

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:32.060
it's me

01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:34.060
MC Scottish

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:36.060
Secession

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:38.060
hey how come

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:40.060
you didn't secede

01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:42.060
Zach are you up there

01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:44.060
why does Zach have to be up there

01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:46.060
it feels like

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.060
it might need a beat

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:50.060
okay

01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:52.060
like troll

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.060
him

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.060
I thought it was a genuine question

01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:58.060
it's me

01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:00.060
I wanted to get

01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:02.060
I don't know what I wanted to do

01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:04.060
I'm drunk

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:52.060
I'm gonna pay no taxes

01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:00.060
Scott

01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:02.060
Scottish

01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:04.060
Scotch

01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:06.060
without me

01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:08.060
you wouldn't have tape

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:10.060
you wouldn't

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:12.060
more strings down here

01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.060
don't know what I want

01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:16.060
okay

01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:18.060
alright we should end that

01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:20.060
the tape thing is

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:22.060
gonna be the peak

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.060
this is a

01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:30.060
fucking surreal

01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:32.060
you came all the way out here

01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:34.060
sorry go ahead

01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:36.060
you're going back

01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:38.060
in a couple of days you said?

01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:40.060
yeah I go back in Thursday

01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:42.060
what's the city in Scotland

01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:44.060
that's like

01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:46.060
I said Glasgow is not

01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:48.060
you have a

01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.060
fancy glass

01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.060
what did you say? glass gleejans?

01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:54.060
glass weijans?

01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:56.060
yeah weijans

01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:58.060
so outside of we get called

01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:00.060
well is there a nickname for them?

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.060
we had weijis here

01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.060
weijis

01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:06.060
but I'm saying do you have a name

01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:08.060
for the upper class

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:10.060
glass gleejans?

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:12.060
yeah

01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:14.060
but if you're just

01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:16.060
tuning in that word means a different thing

01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:18.060
in Europe like it's not

01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:20.060
it doesn't have the

01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:22.060
it doesn't have quite the

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:24.060
it doesn't have quite the

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.060
apart from everyone

01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:28.060
it's the highest place you can get

01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:30.060
but I'm probably a cunt

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.060
you had a great cunt

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.060
I think

01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:36.060
I saw our friends with a comedian

01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:38.060
in Scotland and he said

01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:40.060
I'm going to absolutely butcher this

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:42.060
fucking bit

01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:44.060
Scotland is the most progressive place in the world

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:46.060
because it's been a place

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:48.060
where women

01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:50.060
are

01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:52.060
the most progressive place in the world because

01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:54.060
women don't see gender because every single week

01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:56.060
women are telling guys they're going to kick their cunt

01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:58.060
in

01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:00.060
and I absolutely butcher that

01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:02.060
the guy's fucking amazing

01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:04.060
by his DVD

01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:06.060
I guess I was going to ask like

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.060
is it

01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:10.060
is Edinburgh

01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:12.060
is that the capital of Scotland

01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:14.060
and is that

01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:16.060
the New York of Scotland in terms of

01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:18.060
finance

01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:20.060
industry

01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:22.060
Glasgow is Glasgow bigger than Edinburgh?

01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:24.060
I think

01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:26.060
to do with finance and stuff it is but I think

01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:28.060
also Scotland revolves so much around

01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:30.060
well

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.060
that's in keeping like we have DC

01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:34.060
which is smaller and less important

01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:36.060
and more industrial

01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:38.060
but also

01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:40.060
we've got

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:42.060
this sounds so pathetic

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.060
but we've got the two

01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:46.060
best football teams

01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:48.060
and soccer teams as well

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:50.060
which ones? Rangers

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:52.060
or Celtic Rangers

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:54.060
the Lakers

01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:56.060
yeah I'm a Celtic

01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:00.060
I'm a hardcore heart

01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:02.060
heart's glorious heart

01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:04.060
the banks are in castle

01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:06.060
the talk of the tune

01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:08.060
and the boys in the room

01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:10.060
I want to bring

01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:12.060
Omar Camacho back and have

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:14.060
Cholos try drinking with

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:16.060
Scots

01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.060
the most dangerous games you

01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:20.060
ever fucking go to is the Celtic Rangers game

01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:22.060
the teams

01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:24.060
have to come

01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:26.060
the fans have to come from different sides of the town

01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:28.060
and arrive at different times

01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:30.060
and leave at different times

01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:32.060
and you're not allowed to even wear the strip

01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:34.060
you can't even wear it

01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:36.060
you can't wear the jerseys around town

01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:38.060
there's just going to be violence

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:40.060
do you guys

01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:42.060
Celtic's been doing so well

01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:44.060
currently

01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:46.060
the last time

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:48.060
we won

01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:50.060
at Ivoryx

01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:52.060
we won 3-2

01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:54.060
we're now

01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:56.060
the longer the players are banned

01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:58.060
from going to see their own fans

01:42:58.060 --> 01:43:00.060
now

01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:02.060
or doing a lap of honour

01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:04.060
because when

01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:06.060
Celtic won

01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:08.060
players are coming over

01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:10.060
just to do the normal thing

01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:12.060
it came from Germany

01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:14.060
where if you win you go see your fans

01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:16.060
you wave

01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:18.060
you do your victory parade

01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:20.060
they came over to say cheers

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:22.060
and Rangers fans

01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:24.060
in the bottom left corner from what I remember

01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:26.060
we're not happy

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:28.060
the very front

01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:30.060
of their fans is

01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:32.060
people in wheelchairs with disabilities

01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:34.060
and the Rangers fans decided to

01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:36.060
climb on top of them

01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:38.060
and try and get on the pitch to attack the Celtic fans

01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:40.060
which led to a lot of people

01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:42.060
in wheelchairs getting trampled on

01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:44.060
and sued on

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:46.060
and it was Ranger fans trampling their own

01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:48.060
yeah it was Ranger fans

01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:50.060
well that's where liking sports gets you

01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.060
alright

01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:54.060
do you guys still have a spider on your money

01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:56.060
they have a spider on their dollar

01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:58.060
yeah I think so

01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:00.060
because they're George Washington

01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:02.060
is a guy who

01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:04.060
went in a cave and fought a spider

01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:10.060
when your country is old enough

01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:12.060
it's like there's no

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:14.060
oh you made a head wooden teeth he might not have

01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:16.060
he wrote a dragon and he had spiders in his eyes

01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:18.060
it's like some guy

01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:20.060
who was in a cave with a spider

01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:22.060
that was definitely true but I've got a tenor

01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:24.060
with Ravi Burns and

01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:26.060
Edward Cappell

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:28.060
it's very plastic

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:30.060
but there's like a spider where's the spider

01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:32.060
oh that's I mean I think that's on the fiver

01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:34.060
there's a spider on the fiver

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:36.060
you're thinking of the spider king

01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:38.060
oh it's amazing

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:40.060
yeah spider is definitely a thing yeah

01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:42.060
what do we got an eagle and it's like

01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:44.060
Scotland's main thing

01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:46.060
is like our national animal

01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:48.060
is a fucking unicorn

01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:50.060
that's not allowed

01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:52.060
that's not allowed

01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:54.060
they've chosen their national animal

01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:56.060
to be a fucking unicorn

01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:58.060
that's not allowed

01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:00.060
that's not allowed

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:02.060
totally is

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:04.060
oh my passport was a fucking unicorn

01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:06.060
no

01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:08.060
Scotland's not even a country

01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:10.060
that's fighting talk

01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:12.060
oh shit

01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:14.060
we got a headbutt coming from your bagpipe

01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:16.060
now

01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:18.060
he's gonna headbutt you

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:20.060
you're doing Irish

01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:22.060
oh you fucking cunt

01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:24.060
I'm gonna bury my gold under a tree

01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:26.060
you're never gonna find it

01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:28.060
you'll never find my Scottish rainbow

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:30.060
you're doing lucky the leprechaun now

01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:32.060
we are on the Scottish Charms

01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:34.060
surprise more Scottish

01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:36.060
like Americans and stuff don't do

01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:38.060
bagby's voice for a train spot

01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:40.060
bagby bagby

01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:42.060
I heard train spotting

01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:44.060
right at the end

01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:46.060
bagby

01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:48.060
bagby is like

01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:50.060
my Irish ex-wife

01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:52.060
was talking

01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:54.060
about Ireland with me

01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:56.060
because she was like

01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:58.060
when Trump got elected

01:45:58.060 --> 01:46:00.060
and was like boy we're having so much grief

01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:02.060
and all this stuff and I was like

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:04.060
you know what we need to do

01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:06.060
is just have a president

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:08.060
at this point we all agree

01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:10.060
that the president is the new king

01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:12.060
and we should have

01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:14.060
let the president

01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:16.060
be a ceremonial

01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:18.060
title because it has so much more to do

01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:20.060
with pride and fucking symbolism

01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:22.060
and let the smarty

01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:24.060
pances that are only gonna ruin that party

01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:26.060
actually

01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:28.060
understand that there's the equivalent of like a chancellor

01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:30.060
or prime minister who went to law school

01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:32.060
and graduated

01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:34.060
any school and

01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:36.060
is like you elect them based on

01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:38.060
like their job that they're gonna do and they don't wear a jacket

01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:40.060
she told me Ireland

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:42.060
has that exact thing they have an Irish president

01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:44.060
and who is really

01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:46.060
more like

01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:48.060
I'm the Irish president and I'm just like kind of here to say

01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:50.060
it's great to be Irish

01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:52.060
and then they have a prime minister

01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:54.060
who's actually kind of like

01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:56.060
a new age

01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:58.060
because of the way

01:46:58.060 --> 01:47:00.060
I don't think anybody really

01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:02.060
truly knows Irish politics that well

01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:04.060
because it's a fucking mess

01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:06.060
because they don't fucking count

01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:08.060
I still know Irish

01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:10.060
I'm trying to get on your good side

01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:12.060
but I keep sounding Irish

01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:14.060
ah come on it's me

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:16.060
your friend Dan Harmon

01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:18.060
but they

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:20.060
I think

01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:22.060
the way it works because of Northern Ireland

01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:24.060
the Republic Ireland

01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:26.060
if you're voting for

01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:28.060
the public you have to vote for Sinn Fein

01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:30.060
so I think there's 12

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:32.060
Sinn Fein ministers

01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:34.060
in London

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:36.060
and they will not vote in anything

01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:38.060
that isn't specifically

01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:40.060
about Ireland

01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:42.060
so people like Scotland

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:44.060
try and get them to vote for us

01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:46.060
a wee bit but they refuse

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:48.060
I love the Irish so much

01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:50.060
but Scotland's good

01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:52.060
no Scotland's great

01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:54.060
we've got a female First Minister

01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:56.060
who's amazing

01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:58.060
so how is your structure

01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:00.060
do you have a prime minister

01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.060
you call her the First Minister

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:04.060
she's the First Minister

01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:06.060
and basically England pretends we've got power

01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:08.060
and she gets to kind of wield it

01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:10.060
England pretends what?

01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:12.060
we've got power

01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:14.060
they pretend

01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:16.060
she does nice things

01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:18.060
we've got the NHS

01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:20.060
in general

01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:22.060
but if you're in England you have to pay for prescriptions

01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:24.060
but if you're in Scotland you don't

01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:26.060
if you get bit by a spider

01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:28.060
you're out in the cold

01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:30.060
but that's because they believe

01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:32.060
that God bit you

01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:34.060
it's the only thing

01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:36.060
they believe that spiders are

01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:38.060
you're like

01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:40.060
get a spider bite you

01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:42.060
get out

01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:44.060
then God wants you to die

01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:46.060
education costs money

01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:48.060
Scotland it doesn't

01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:50.060
can you cook on a Robert Burns

01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:52.060
for us

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:56.060
I'd be happy to Jeff

01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:58.060
you talking about his famous poem

01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:00.060
a mouse

01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:02.060
I'll call you some Roger

01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:04.060
I could do it

01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:06.060
I could do it

01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:08.060
do you mind if I do the original

01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:10.060
Scottish dialect

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:12.060
I would love you

01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:14.060
I'm out of practice

01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:16.060
I don't know

01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:18.060
I don't know

01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:20.060
I don't know

01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:22.060
I don't know

01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:24.060
I don't know

01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:26.060
but we

01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:28.060
don't know

01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:30.060
I don't know

01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:32.060
when will be

01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:34.060
there

01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:36.060
they send us

01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:38.060
cliffhanger

01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:48.060
let's give it up to Kyle

01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:50.060
thank you Colin for coming up here

01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:52.060
thank you everybody for coming

01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:54.060
see you next week

we'll give it up for our har certification staff

01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:58.060
I'm your calm controller Jeff Davis

01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:00.820
Charlie Jeff Davis, Spencer, your Game Master.

01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:02.140
Thank you.

01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:03.900
Church taking the stage.

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:06.020
Doing all of your fantastic photography.

01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:08.660
And your mayor, Dan Harmon, of course.

01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:09.500
Thank you all.

01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:10.340
Drive fast.

01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:12.180
Take chances.

01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:35.020
Did you get any of that?

01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:49.420
It's a good show.
