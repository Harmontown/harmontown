explaining to Spencer\n\n03:04.720 --> 03:09.520\nbackstage that a dear friend of mine who I'll give their anonymity because the\n\n03:09.520 --> 03:13.600\npeople that people that that that are passionate about things should I don't\n\n03:13.600 --> 03:16.880\nwant I don't I don't yeah I just like this conversation I'm having with this\n\n03:16.880 --> 03:21.000\nperson who keeps recommending this Jordan Peterson guy like you gotta listen\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:26.520\nto Jordan Peterson and and I keep I keep going like like yeah I will I mean by\n\n03:26.520 --> 03:31.640\nthe way I haven't seen Atlanta yet it's on season nine so so when I when I when\n\n03:31.640 --> 03:34.720\nI don't bother to do something it's not because I hope but I don't think it's\n\n03:34.720 --> 03:39.160\nbecause I'm stubborn or or doing something but however I do keep saying\n\n03:39.160 --> 03:43.680\nto the person like I'm gonna I'm gonna listen to him because you say he's smart\n\n03:43.680 --> 03:48.400\nhe's interesting and all this stuff but I will tell you that every that every\n\n03:48.400 --> 03:53.960\nlink you send me and every time I Google it keeps saying like in it says from\n\n03:53.960 --> 03:59.080\nhis from his fans and God knows people's fans can misrepresent them\n\n03:59.080 --> 04:06.040\nunintentionally thinking how do you know that then but but but it does say\n\n04:06.040 --> 04:16.160\nthings like you know truth bomb Jordan Peterson debunks the concept of white\n\n04:16.160 --> 04:23.600\nprivilege disproves the pay gap blah blah blah and and I don't you know and\n\n04:23.600 --> 04:27.760\nthen I say that back to the person and then that person always says like they\n\n04:27.760 --> 04:39.640\ngo he's really interesting but there's always it's like I never I never get a\n\n04:39.640 --> 04:45.760\nwhat what why is he a plumber what is he like what do you mean because the\n\n04:45.760 --> 04:51.040\nheadline is that he debunked the concept of white privilege did he also tell you\n\n04:51.040 --> 04:56.680\nhow to install a backsplash in your kitchen and so I but the reason I bring\n\n04:56.680 --> 05:01.800\nit up is not it was not too I certainly want this person to continue to I like\n\n05:01.800 --> 05:07.120\npeople to share like if you're into somebody I fucking we bonded early on\n\n05:07.120 --> 05:10.400\nwe love our gnome Chomsky like like who knows if he's fallen in and out of\n\n05:10.400 --> 05:17.240\nfashion but but but some people have to hear tonight so some some some some\n\n05:17.240 --> 05:20.560\npeople could could turn red in the face when you mention his name some people\n\n05:20.560 --> 05:23.560\nroll their eyes automatically some people are very familiar with them and\n\n05:23.560 --> 05:25.800\nwe'll do either of those things some people not familiar at all we'll do\n\n05:25.800 --> 05:32.240\nthose things like it I you and I started a friendship to talking about because I\n\n05:32.240 --> 05:35.760\nknew him as a linguist and and you knew him as a political dissident and when\n\n05:35.760 --> 05:41.040\nwe exchanged things and all these things so I don't want anybody to ever be\n\n05:41.040 --> 05:45.760\nafraid that they're gonna suggest I read something or listen to something that\n\n05:45.760 --> 05:49.800\nbecause I'm gonna like snootily high road them I brought it up because it's\n\n05:49.800 --> 05:53.360\ncaused me to do some soul searching here because I'm explaining to the person\n\n05:53.360 --> 05:57.880\nthat taught me some things about myself that that that I want to get off my\n\n05:57.880 --> 06:04.960\nchest which is like this it's like I'd like it's like oh you guys like I don't\n\n06:04.960 --> 06:12.480\nI don't I am not ashamed of the of the idea of what my detractors would call\n\n06:12.480 --> 06:19.040\nvirtue signaling I I or white nighting or whatever kind of code for that stuff I\n\n06:19.040 --> 06:26.000\ndon't understand unless you want to challenge society and change it go to\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:31.520\ntoe-to-toe with it or get paid to talk about it why would you want to do\n\n06:31.520 --> 06:38.160\nanything other than make it not kill you I do like the therapist saying do you\n\n06:38.160 --> 06:42.640\nwant to be happy or do you want to be right like I want to be happy so like\n\n06:42.640 --> 06:47.960\nlike isn't that what virtue signaling is isn't it like if you're 45 white\n\n06:47.960 --> 06:55.480\nstraight rich standing on top of a pile of money what why is it like why is it a\n\n06:55.480 --> 07:02.320\nbetrayal why is it a bad move to shout down to all the poor people that you can\n\n07:02.320 --> 07:10.320\nhear you I'm gonna do everything I can to help you don't set this on fire I'm\n\n07:10.320 --> 07:21.080\non top of it I like you and would like this to continue the way it is I like\n\n07:21.080 --> 07:25.560\nbut shouldn't they be concerned that the money is just in a pile like that seems\n\n07:25.560 --> 07:30.960\nlike well that's of course it's in a pile that brings up an interesting point\n\n07:30.960 --> 07:35.640\nwhich which is that also you know I actually don't think this is the ideal\n\n07:35.640 --> 07:43.680\nsituation I'm gonna try even harder to achieve some changes because boy I can\n\n07:43.680 --> 07:52.080\nsee your house from here and it's very small like like I died like people\n\n07:52.080 --> 07:56.640\nthink that it's somehow a counter argument to say to that you're just\n\n07:56.640 --> 08:02.520\nsaying what you think people want to hear so that you don't get beaten up or\n\n08:02.520 --> 08:09.200\nsuffer what when did that become a valid point of view like oh are we\n\n08:09.200 --> 08:16.480\nrevolutionaries when we when we like tell the truth is this about knowing the\n\n08:16.480 --> 08:21.560\ntruth like do I want to really go home tonight and crack a book if I have a\n\n08:21.560 --> 08:30.280\nchoice between two books and one says female lesbian colon how women are\n\n08:30.280 --> 08:35.840\ntreated unfairly and have been since the dawn of humankind asterisk notice we\n\n08:35.840 --> 08:41.480\ndidn't say mankind because fuck men and then the other book is like the big lie\n\n08:41.480 --> 08:47.640\nhow liberalism is no different from Nazis and why Nazism isn't that bad\n\n08:47.640 --> 08:56.680\nanyway which I I I still have that I still have I still have that one for\n\n08:56.680 --> 09:03.000\nsale on Amazon right now I told you not to self-publish I told you I try you're\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.320\ngonna end up spending more than you make you you're you're being a real\n\n09:06.320 --> 09:14.600\nfeminine capital Nazi right you the the but I'm gonna I'm gonna if I'm if I'm\n\n09:14.600 --> 09:19.040\non a sinking ship and I'm like I got one book for the next ten years I'm gonna\n\n09:19.040 --> 09:24.680\nnot because I'm so fucking noble and open-minded I'm gonna I'm gonna take the\n\n09:24.680 --> 09:29.840\nthe feminist book because it's gonna have more information that that I don't\n\n09:29.840 --> 09:35.400\nalready have and don't suffer from you know I'm kind of like I don't yeah I\n\n09:35.400 --> 09:41.280\njust read my book just give it a chance I don't want to know I don't want to be\n\n09:41.280 --> 09:45.040\nable to if I I don't want to be in a convoy what conversation am I ever gonna\n\n09:45.040 --> 09:49.680\nhave in the future where I'm gonna be thinking boy oh boy this would go so\n\n09:49.680 --> 09:54.800\nmuch better as bad as it's going God it would go better if I just had the\n\n09:54.800 --> 10:02.520\nacademic chops to prove that maternity leave is unfair I just god damn it I\n\n10:02.520 --> 10:08.560\ndon't have the fucking noodle for it I do have the noodle for it that's the\n\n10:08.560 --> 10:15.360\nproblem whether I believe it passionately or not what I don't have in my\n\n10:15.360 --> 10:20.760\nhead is the is the is the reasons why people be talking about other stuff and\n\n10:20.760 --> 10:30.520\nI want to I want people to like me I just and I don't where do you stand I'm\n\n10:30.520 --> 10:41.280\nbuilding seven what's the what is the least popular opinion what I I it's I\n\n10:41.280 --> 10:48.880\nSpencer said something really funny cuz we were talking about cuz I'm gonna\n\n10:48.880 --> 10:53.040\nlisten to the Jordan Peterson thing but you were you were talking about the\n\n10:53.040 --> 10:56.320\nnatural naturalist thing when you're going like some of this stuff is like\n\n10:56.320 --> 11:00.640\npeople say you gotta listen to this guy and then you listen to the guy and it's\n\n11:00.640 --> 11:04.320\nlike oh he's so smart it's like they got a PhD and they're like oh man they gave\n\n11:04.320 --> 11:08.040\na lecture and it was so amazing the way they broke it down and like a lot of it\n\n11:08.040 --> 11:13.240\ncomes down to like naturalism tropes where it's like hey people aren't\n\n11:13.240 --> 11:17.080\nnaturally monogamous or the way humans work isn't like this or that it's like\n\n11:17.080 --> 11:22.200\nand I and I said yeah but people don't poop in toilets naturally like we just\n\n11:22.200 --> 11:28.600\nkind of yeah toilets are great and use and you said yeah it's Spencer's\n\n11:28.600 --> 11:35.720\nsummation of the naturalist fallacy is like is like hey man ducks don't be gay\n\n11:35.720 --> 11:41.040\nthat's the that's the fallacy people say yeah the naturalization\n\n11:41.040 --> 11:45.480\nsee is ducks don't be gay I didn't I didn't I didn't service it in the retail\n\n11:45.480 --> 11:51.720\nit's that it's that people say oh this isn't natural therefore it's bad and\n\n11:51.720 --> 11:55.680\nthen they say like oh you know like like an argument against gay marriage or\n\n11:55.680 --> 11:59.560\nwhatever it's like gay being gay is unnatural it's like ducks aren't gay in\n\n11:59.560 --> 12:03.440\nthe wild animals aren't gay and then of course animals are gay in the wild but\n\n12:03.440 --> 12:08.440\nlike but like that it's a fallacy that people make to prove their point when\n\n12:08.440 --> 12:13.360\nthey get but a fallacy is an invalid argument by nature anyway I I do a lot\n\n12:13.360 --> 12:18.880\nof research I love it I'm on I'm online all the time checking things reading\n\n12:18.880 --> 12:24.720\nthings who knows if they're good or bad I don't know it's the internet but\n\n12:24.720 --> 12:28.720\nbasically everything that I understand about Jordan Peterson just comes down\n\n12:28.720 --> 12:33.520\nto that fallacy it's like well actually it turns out like lobsters like kill\n\n12:33.520 --> 12:36.920\neach other and so like it's fine to want to kill each other or like you know it's\n\n12:36.920 --> 12:40.880\njust all that fallacy where it's just like well no that's not true that's\n\n12:40.880 --> 12:45.120\nsomething else is sometimes he's giving a giving one of those talks and if\n\n12:45.120 --> 12:48.880\nsomebody just starts go from the audience going like hey I like your wife I\n\n12:48.880 --> 12:53.240\nwant to fuck your wife he's like sorry excuse me like he wouldn't have security\n\n12:53.240 --> 12:57.400\nescort that person out right because he doesn't believe in marriage and he'd be\n\n12:57.400 --> 13:02.400\nhappy if he is married to have a stronger person with a louder voice that that\n\n13:02.400 --> 13:08.160\nfelt like talking at that moment like microphones aren't fucking cavemen but\n\n13:08.160 --> 13:11.800\nI'm not I'm not I'm not speak I'm not lampooning this person that because I\n\n13:11.800 --> 13:15.400\ndon't want to commit the crime of like making you you've you've you've maybe\n\n13:15.400 --> 13:20.160\nread or heard him I'm I'm I'm just lame I'm just done I'm just riffing on the\n\n13:20.160 --> 13:24.880\nidea of like the people that go like you know monogamy is not a thing like in\n\n13:24.880 --> 13:30.880\n58 countries and stuff it's like yeah man I when did you ever get the\n\n13:30.880 --> 13:35.440\nimpression that humanity like wanted to be natural like like how is that our\n\n13:35.440 --> 13:40.880\ngimmick like like what I just I just so confounded by it and I kind of like\n\n13:40.880 --> 13:44.120\nmaybe I wasn't confounded by it six years ago I mean I know if you listen to\n\n13:44.120 --> 13:48.880\nthis podcast you're gonna hear me take complete 180s on a lot of fundamental\n\n13:48.880 --> 13:53.440\nstuff and I I don't I'm not gonna chalk it up to turbulent times or anything\n\n13:53.440 --> 13:58.720\nchanging I'm gonna I'm gonna first and foremost say I'm old I am I am thank\n\n13:58.720 --> 14:06.440\nGod successful I I I just I just have this amazing like weird unsettling\n\n14:06.440 --> 14:11.080\ncouples therapy session with Cody we went we went in to get the 60,000 mile\n\n14:11.080 --> 14:17.280\ncheckup and kind of we were like it was a because we had back-to-back sessions\n\n14:17.280 --> 14:21.520\nthat we're gonna be solo but if we come in together that is like like that's our\n\n14:21.520 --> 14:26.280\nchoice and then play so it was like basically like it could it could have\n\n14:26.280 --> 14:32.000\nbeen a two-hour session or a two you know two whatever 50 plus 50 is a hundred\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:43.440\na hundred minute session what is 50 plus 50 and it was like way more than like\n\n14:43.440 --> 14:47.040\n20 minutes before the end of an hour clearly the therapist just ran out of\n\n14:47.040 --> 14:55.520\ngas was like by virtue of our happiness like she was like huh okay well ah look\n\n14:55.520 --> 15:04.640\nI don't know what to tell you guys you you love each other and you communicate\n\n15:04.640 --> 15:09.520\nand that seems to be working and I gotta tell you I've had a pretty long day of\n\n15:09.520 --> 15:13.080\nheterosexual couple couples like fucking bringing me down with a bunch of shit\n\n15:13.080 --> 15:15.320\nabout the same shit you're talking about cuz they don't know

to pieces\n\n15:51.600 --> 15:54.600\nand she wants to get the fuck yeah she's sort of like and I kind of project\n\n15:54.600 --> 15:57.880\non her because I'm a cynic I'm like I've done a storyteller I'm kind of just\n\n15:57.880 --> 16:01.960\nthinking like oh she's a married lesbian I wonder if part of her is thinking like\n\n16:01.960 --> 16:06.280\nyeah must be nice what the fuck get out of here you know it's like cuz it's\n\n16:06.280 --> 16:08.880\nlike we're specific we're talking about well maybe we're gonna move in together\n\n16:08.880 --> 16:13.320\nand and you know we we we think about children but we don't think about\n\n16:13.320 --> 16:17.160\nchildren and all this stuff and like just kind of like I know it's probably\n\n16:17.160 --> 16:20.240\nnot the case because she just makes these faces she has these like faces she\n\n16:20.240 --> 16:23.840\nmakes when she's actually like when she's certain about things and it kind of\n\n16:23.840 --> 16:29.360\njust like doubles as someone who is secretly hateful but I it's not okay\n\n16:29.360 --> 16:35.320\nbut she's just kind of like yeah you know seems like it's working huh huh yeah\n\n16:35.320 --> 16:41.160\nyeah and I'm I like thinking that she wants to stab our eyes out because she's\n\n16:41.160 --> 16:46.600\nlike must be nice time to go home to my lesbian wife god damn it\n\n16:49.520 --> 16:55.960\nthat is not me saying that lesbians are less happy no I am absolutely what you\n\n16:55.960 --> 17:00.080\nsaid that is not true that's not what I well it may be true that that's what I\n\n17:00.080 --> 17:04.760\naccidentally applied but I absolutely the grass is always greener I picture\n\n17:04.760 --> 17:08.480\nlesbians as being incredibly happy because you probably have to and I'm\n\n17:08.480 --> 17:14.920\nsure they fight all the time like like cats and cats all right come on stupid\n\n17:14.920 --> 17:21.800\nit's Dom it's stupid well cast stupid stupid dumb jokes the but I actually I\n\n17:21.800 --> 17:25.000\nalways picture gay people as happier than straight people in couples because you\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:31.720\nthen it's probably a revert like a kind of a different form of not what do you\n\n17:31.720 --> 17:34.720\ncall it's easy to say like oh that's a different form of racism but you can't\n\n17:34.720 --> 17:37.880\nsay it's a different form of homophobia because you're not phobic but it's still\n\n17:37.880 --> 17:44.760\nit's still dehumanizing to say I bet gay people are happier than straight\n\n17:44.760 --> 17:49.360\npeople you're still saying like gay you know because they're so different but\n\n17:49.360 --> 17:56.440\nyou know I'll cause I picture I picture a gay couple like like the gay partner\n\n17:56.440 --> 18:02.640\nnumber one comes home and puts their gay why is one partner number one because I\n\n18:02.640 --> 18:06.720\ndidn't want to be like the guy can't be like the gay husband because that's the\n\n18:06.720 --> 18:15.360\ngood thing we do is like well who's the caboose and how I was like straight\n\n18:15.360 --> 18:18.400\npeople want to like project their child like which one of you's gonna wear the\n\n18:18.400 --> 18:25.720\ntux and I had to learn that that's that's not a thing that they love like\n\n18:25.720 --> 18:30.840\nI like you know like it's like the Tatanka thing in\n\n18:30.840 --> 18:33.840\ndances with wolves like you fucking like listen and you you're gonna be wrong\n\n18:33.840 --> 18:36.840\nabout shit and you try to achieve like I'm gonna stop you you're doing this\n\n18:36.840 --> 18:45.480\nwrong so so I but I always picture regardless of that I picture here's\n\n18:45.480 --> 18:51.120\nwhat I picture how do you picture how do I picture a gay gay gay partner number\n\n18:51.120 --> 18:59.640\none comes home puts gay briefcase down and I'm sorry gay part of everyone\n\n18:59.640 --> 19:03.800\ncomes home and does what puts gay briefcase down gay brief why is the\n\n19:03.800 --> 19:09.320\ngay why is the briefcase gay because they're not a sellout because they didn't\n\n19:09.320 --> 19:11.880\nlet their job define them because they're fucked because when they go to\n\n19:11.880 --> 19:16.280\nwork it's with a gay briefcase I'm more on that later okay that's about personal\n\n19:16.280 --> 19:21.840\nfulfillment like I'm talking about coming back to briefcase identity right\n\n19:21.840 --> 19:27.760\nthey put their briefcase down and then the gay couple gay part participant in\n\n19:27.760 --> 19:35.200\ngay couple number two is in bed doing a crossword and and says how was your day\n\n19:35.200 --> 19:40.720\nand and the answer is you know it was and they and they rattle off like a\n\n19:40.720 --> 19:45.600\nbunch of things that make your day neutral Gary at work still still doing\n\n19:45.600 --> 19:52.440\nthe thing where he calls my briefcase gay and Dan keeps trying to prove he's\n\n19:52.440 --> 19:56.560\nnot homophobic by asking those questions about who wore the tux at the\n\n19:56.560 --> 20:01.840\nwedding and and all these things and then and then they go yeah it was a hard\n\n20:01.840 --> 20:05.600\nthinking it was like and then they and then I just pictured them going like but\n\n20:05.600 --> 20:10.480\nI know one thing for sure I love you and then what you know what it's probably an\n\n20:10.480 --> 20:13.720\ninternal process not an external one but I picture inside their brains I'm\n\n20:13.720 --> 20:20.560\ngoing like I I'm able to believe that more than the average straight person\n\n20:20.560 --> 20:28.360\nbecause this isn't fucking sanctioned it's it was more difficult to get here it\n\n20:28.360 --> 20:35.280\nwas harder to like it like there's there's already friction in just like\n\n20:35.280 --> 20:40.880\ngetting here about myself and then I found you and then the two of us are\n\n20:40.880 --> 20:46.120\ntogether and that who knows who approved of that or not but in any case boy when\n\n20:46.120 --> 20:50.240\nwe wake up in the morning we really have to ask ourselves do I want to do this\n\n20:50.240 --> 20:56.360\nand if we and if we fucking stop wanting it Newtonian physics will fucking\n\n20:56.360 --> 21:02.920\nfling it apart like our parents will pay us like they'll be like thank God\n\n21:02.920 --> 21:10.160\nyou're straight I knew it like like all of that like you know it's like like so\n\n21:10.160 --> 21:14.960\nthat's probably all that's an example of how you can have the you can be an\n\n21:14.960 --> 21:19.920\nadvocate you can be a supporter and you can still be you know part of the\n\n21:19.920 --> 21:25.640\nproblem because because I'm thinking of these people as a different species I'm\n\n21:25.640 --> 21:31.360\nthinking of them as oh Marvel or versus DC or something like like but they have\n\n21:31.360 --> 21:37.080\nGreen Lantern meetings where they can make parties out of that as long as\n\n21:37.080 --> 21:41.600\nthey're not yellow I just can't believe that you that you think of briefcases\n\n21:41.600 --> 21:46.800\nas being binary yeah you know you guys know what I'm picturing when I say\n\n21:46.800 --> 21:54.680\nstraight briefcase no no no we don't know you you fucking tell me what you\n\n21:54.680 --> 21:58.360\nthink of when you think of straight briefcase you know a fucking goose step\n\n21:58.360 --> 22:05.440\nin brown ass fucking thing with the dial code and the fucking combinations your\n\n22:05.440 --> 22:12.560\nbirthday because your fucking cisgender heteronormative piece of shit and who\n\n22:12.560 --> 22:16.000\ncares about that the code's probably one two three four because you know what's\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:24.040\nin there a bunch of fucking pictures of the opposite sex naked yawn\n\n22:30.480 --> 22:36.680\ngood save good say I don't need I don't need saves I'm fucking honest you can't\n\n22:36.680 --> 22:42.760\nsay I'm fucking lampooning myself I'm delightful you are delightful I'm not\n\n22:42.760 --> 22:46.240\nsure of the right to remain there is no such thing as a save when you're a\n\n22:46.240 --> 22:51.840\nHarlem Globetrotter like my job isn't to beat the Washington generals it's not\n\n22:51.840 --> 22:55.560\nreal basketball I'm fucking full of fucking like I got a bucket of confetti\n\n22:55.560 --> 23:05.480\nin my shorts it's it's it's about being fucking real prove it prove it you have\n\n23:05.480 --> 23:10.640\nto subscribe to see that I really did it yeah for $5 a month he didn't have any\n\n23:10.640 --> 23:17.560\nconfetti in his shorts yeah so anyways I don't know yeah I just like that\n\n23:17.560 --> 23:21.360\nconversation with my friend thank God I have a friend who's like pushing Jordan\n\n23:21.360 --> 23:25.280\nPeterson I mean because that make me actually explore myself and go well if\n\n23:25.280 --> 23:28.480\nI don't if I don't stay on this schedule of I promise to listen to him\n\n23:28.480 --> 23:32.040\ntomorrow it's probably because I've actually made a decision in my life I\n\n23:32.040 --> 23:35.240\nshould acknowledge which is that I'm a little more interested in boning up on\n\n23:35.240 --> 23:41.200\nhow to function like I'm more interested in how to let people know that\n\n23:41.200 --> 23:46.000\ndespite the shape of my face the placement of my eyebrows that the the\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:52.320\nGoogle auto conclusions of my name the the everything that you may have heard\n\n23:52.320 --> 23:58.440\nabout me that actually I am very interested in you being comfortable with\n\n23:58.440 --> 24:03.680\nme and that that's actually like if you see me outside of my house it's because\n\n24:03.680 --> 24:06.840\nI chose to leave the house and that while I'm outside the house I actually\n\n24:06.840 --> 24:10.640\nregarded as a shared world with you and that I would like to make sure that you\n\n24:10.640 --> 24:15.280\ndon't leave the conversation frowning even if you're crazy like like like like\n\n24:15.280 --> 24:19.240\nbecause one out of ten people is and I'm like well we can't fucking let

you know like like\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:34.280\nlike like at the expense of like not meeting more novas or or or or Jane\n\n24:34.280 --> 24:43.640\nJane cooks or or or or or Spencers or this guy Jeff

because there's 11 and I got a degree in diehard at Columbia anyways so the\n\n32:32.160 --> 32:35.400\nsong's called smoke the reason I thought we're listed a true crime podcast so\n\n32:35.400 --> 32:38.400\nthere were these a couple months all the true crime podcast like all said the\n\n32:38.400 --> 32:45.320\nsame thing a couple months ago there was this family they they they 17 year old\n\n32:45.320 --> 32:50.760\ngirl escaped from the family she called 911 and and the cop showed up and she\n\n32:50.760 --> 32:56.240\nsaid my kid my siblings have been imprisoned for fucking 20 years in our\n\n32:56.240 --> 33:00.680\nhouse it was like you might remember that it was like this news item about this\n\n33:00.680 --> 33:05.720\nthis family that kept all 13 of their kids like chained to their beds for\n\n33:05.720 --> 33:11.720\nlike forever and some of them were in their 20s because you can't have like\n\n33:11.720 --> 33:16.760\nthat many kids without some of them being in their 20s like like it takes like up\n\n33:16.760 --> 33:21.160\nto nine months to make each one and you have to lie fallow once every three\n\n33:21.160 --> 33:26.000\nyears so they just had like that so they had full grown adults who are like\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:30.920\nmalnourished and anyways the family's the last name is the Turpins and we're\n\n33:30.920 --> 33:33.120\nlike holy shit what's up with these Turpins and then I just started you know\n\n33:33.120 --> 33:35.480\nwe're feeding the dogs and we're just kind of high and I'm like I've been\n\n33:35.480 --> 33:43.040\nturpin and Cody's laughing and I'm like doing this I've been turpin oh yeah you\n\n33:43.040 --> 33:47.280\nknow I've been turpin and she's like what is that song and I'm like I think it's\n\n33:47.280 --> 33:50.200\nlike what is it I've been smoking I'm smoking what is that song and I was\n\n33:50.200 --> 33:53.240\nlike is that I believe in miracles what is it it's really clever you've been\n\n33:53.240 --> 33:56.200\nlooking for and then I find it it's called stroking this song is like what is\n\n33:56.200 --> 34:01.360\nthis song I agree before you even play it this song is fucking strange it is so\n\n34:01.360 --> 34:06.880\nfucking weird for the weirdest reasons because the guy is it about fucking or\n\n34:06.880 --> 34:12.360\nsecond or stroking or I don't know that's part of the twist is it is that so\n\n34:12.360 --> 34:15.560\nI don't think I don't think I'm allowed to play it I don't think I play it who\n\n34:15.560 --> 34:20.880\ngives a fuck is stroking gonna sue us well we could always delete it later\n\n34:20.880 --> 34:26.600\nI guess if I assume like if I say like how about this like I mean I play it like\n\n34:26.600 --> 34:31.680\nlike what is it it costs like 35 grand to like buy like a Sarah Bareilles song\n\n34:31.680 --> 34:35.680\nbut we can delete it at any time if we want to just not put it on we can delete\n\n34:35.680 --> 34:39.720\nit tomorrow before it drops it's fine to play it as a live performance in this\n\n34:39.720 --> 34:44.800\nroom oh that I know so so right right right but but if you don't want it to\n\n34:44.800 --> 34:50.320\nexist forever we want we might have to drop it and just right yeah I do think\n\n34:50.320 --> 34:53.840\nit's valuable to just like it's important but we could bleep it and tell\n\n34:53.840 --> 34:59.800\nhim go online and listen to it online well I type because these folks they\n\n34:59.800 --> 35:06.600\ncan't do that that would be rude to the show we're kind of a lot of like younger\n\n35:06.600 --> 35:09.800\npeople in the audience that you know they're like they have no\n\n35:09.800 --> 35:16.240\nleft here it is it's like right one point yeah he's uh stroking this is\n\n35:16.240 --> 35:20.360\nsomething that I'll be doing tonight like it goes into stroking is that\n\n35:20.360 --> 35:24.960\nsomething that are we doing tonight is always said more or less he I know he\n\n35:24.960 --> 35:29.520\nstrokes it to the left I'm pretty sure he strokes it to the right how could you\n\n35:29.520 --> 35:34.280\nknow I'm a I'm a Libra so you gotta stroke it to the left and stroke it to\n\n35:34.280 --> 35:38.520\nthe right because I'm about I'm about balance the signals really weak in here\n\n35:38.520 --> 35:41.800\nI think I'm gonna I'm gonna bail on the plan play the fucking song no I'm gonna\n\n35:41.800 --> 35:46.520\nI'm just just said the opposite right so if you take the opposite point of view\n\n35:46.520 --> 35:53.000\nthat what you're doing is you're just putting the brakes I knowing it isn't\n\n35:53.000 --> 36:00.200\nthat I'm not hey I know it too God if only someone knew the way I have the\n\n36:00.200 --> 36:08.480\nlyrics written down I don't need someone to know them okay so so he says well\n\n36:08.480 --> 36:13.840\nthis is great we don't have that anything right and they'll Google it anyway so he\n\n36:13.840 --> 36:20.560\nsays he he's the protagonist essentially right yeah yeah I mean yeah it's not\n\n36:20.560 --> 36:27.560\nabout Dracula he says I it's the first person I don't like he never says on\n\n36:27.560 --> 36:31.320\nthe song by the way I've been Dracula this whole time oh and no and quite\n\n36:31.320 --> 36:35.240\nfrankly actually toward the end he in a very smart branding move he has a woman\n\n36:35.240 --> 36:53.600\ncry out his name many many oh okay it started playing so oh wait sorry that's\n\n36:53.600 --> 37:13.960\npartway into the song okay so so let's stop it there when I start making love\n\n37:13.960 --> 37:20.840\nI don't just make love I'd be stroking right so now I'm gonna ask the question\n\n37:20.840 --> 37:26.760\nlater what does he think we're gonna think he means and what could he\n\n37:26.760 --> 37:32.640\npossibly mean if he doesn't mean and I have I am I am the last person to shame\n\n37:32.640 --> 37:38.480\nhim for this because I literally be stroking during making love in a variety\n\n37:38.480 --> 37:43.600\nof ways like I'm very like happy to involve self-pleasure in a queer\n\n37:43.600 --> 37:51.360\nintersectionality with fucking like sex is a journey not a destination right\n\n37:51.360 --> 37:55.440\nit's that you fucking hang out with somebody it's a it's a thing you do for\n\n37:55.440 --> 37:59.040\na while and when it stops it stops and whoever's stroking is stroking you have\n\n37:59.040 --> 38:08.360\nbeen you you have been stroking in your own whatever yeah I mean it's like like\n\n38:08.360 --> 38:11.280\nmy therapist said to me at one point she's like you know you're gonna be in a\n\n38:11.280 --> 38:15.600\nrelationship one day where you're gonna feel like masturbating while you're\n\n38:15.600 --> 38:19.120\nplaying a video game and your girlfriend is gonna be in the same building and\n\n38:19.120 --> 38:26.920\nyou're gonna think I'm gonna go find her and and and make it her problem as a\n\n38:26.920 --> 38:31.640\nword as a as a path of least resistance I was good and I was like that's not\n\n38:31.640 --> 38:34.760\ntrue that's not how monogamy ends up working like come on we tug one out\n\n38:34.760 --> 38:37.080\nwhether in the shower and we cut because we don't want to like have\n\n38:37.080 --> 38:39.640\nconversations about blah blah blah and it's like no that's all about shame and\n\n38:39.640 --> 38:43.600\nall this stuff is like sure enough I was like goddamn I'm horny I knowing that I\n\n38:43.600 --> 38:49.680\nthere's no shame in me being able to just fucking start stroking and Cody can\n\n38:49.680 --> 38:53.920\neither be fine with that or I guess I was like like it's not about getting caught\n\n38:53.920 --> 38:58.640\ndoing it trying not to wake them up but it's like like Dix hard stroke stroke\n\n38:58.640 --> 39:02.360\nstroke and then like and like because she'll she'll do it too it's like like\n\n39:02.360 --> 39:05.840\nwe'll be watching Superman too and she'll be like yeah and I'll be like what\n\n39:05.840 --> 39:11.720\ndid you fart and she goes no I came like you just masturbated and she's like\n\n39:11.720 --> 39:16.600\nyeah I'm the fucking master and I'm like this bitch is amazing and I'm off the\n\n39:16.600 --> 39:23.200\nhook forever like that is what you need is a partner during Superman to dick\n\n39:23.200 --> 39:30.240\nDonna got fired off that movie she still came so she be stroking you be\n\n39:30.240 --> 39:33.480\nstrong anyways I'm not judging the guy I'm just saying like the guy that's what\n\n39:33.480 --> 39:37.400\nhe's eating with I'm just saying I think we've already in the first three like\n\n39:37.400 --> 39:42.200\nlyrics we've crossed a threshold into his world right and it's already weird\n\n39:42.200 --> 39:46.120\nlike he's he's presenting it is weird because when I'm making love I'm not\n\n39:46.120 --> 39:56.720\njust making love I'm also stroking and I'm like okay maybe he has like oxygen\n\n39:56.720 --> 40:10.280\nlost to his brain tell tell me more clearance Carter that's cool he's\n\n40:10.280 --> 40:37.840\nstroking it to her okay now he now let me ask you something okay this list start\n\n40:37.840 --> 40:42.840\nbetter start getting way more fucking adventurous because so far you're\n\n40:42.840 --> 40:49.040\nliterally listing the most common times for love making but guess what he's\n\n40:49.040 --> 40:55.520\njust going to run down a list of the laziest ways to make love but he's\n\n40:55.520 --> 41:00.560\nchalice chest and up on the listener he's good there's a couple more items\n\n41:00.560 --> 41:05.840\nand he gets increasingly defiant like what about this and every time it gets\n\n41:05.840 --> 41:13.160\nmore more common I just wanted to have you ever made love during a lunar eclipse\n\n41:13.160 --> 41:41.800\nhave you ever made love at Lover's Lane okay it's in not on are you are you the\n\n41:41.800 --> 41:50.520\nmonsters on the backseat do you drive an Excalibur are you are you on a plow this\n\n41:50.520 --> 41:56.600\nrecord's called bucket list bucket list for for for De Niro's character and\n\n41:56.600 --> 42:07.680\nawakenings like like too soon for a tennis ball with your right hand have\n\n42:07.680 --> 42:14.040\nyou ever made love when you were 17 and it was uncontrollable have it has dry\n\n42:14.040 --> 42:20.120\nhumping ever led to making love but but but is he leading to something grander\n\n42:20.120 --> 42:26.520\nno he's leading to a segue that's I don't like like how did this song become a\n\n42:26.520 --> 42:32.640\nweird neurotypical challenge because people have you ever made love when\n\n42:32.640 --> 42:37.680\nyou're drunk what does he imagine what does he imagine is the other side of\n\n42:37.680 --> 42:41.320\nthat are they saying well no that's very cool please continue I think he\n\n42:41.320 --> 42:45.360\nimagine only talking to his parents who are like it's a four-poster bed or\n\n42:45.360 --> 42:50.720\nyou're going to hell or are they like saying yeah I have and he's like well\n\n42:50.720 --> 42:54.600\nwhat about in the backseat of a car and he's like yeah I have and they're like\n\n42:54.600 --> 42:58.480\nwell what about on the moon I think he is I think that's what it is because he's\n\n42:58.480 --> 43:02.800\nabout to tell a story about about the backseat it's like a segue well it just\n\n43:02.800 --> 43:07.840\nseems like very much like bragging and I didn't want to leap into he takes it to\n\n43:07.840 --> 43:12.320\nthe bridge is like I'm gonna walk you into my world where hey look there's\n\n43:12.320 --> 43:15.080\ndifferent ways sometimes you're in the backseat of a car the story takes place\n\n43:15.080 --> 43:18.360\nin the backseat of car because police are about to be involved and I don't want\n\n43:18.360 --> 43:22.360\nyou to picture them coming into my bedroom and so yes I was in the backseat\n\n43:22.360 --> 43:28.200\nof a car and in case you're gonna be thrown by that police car no he wasn't\n\n43:28.200 --> 43:32.120\na police sorry sorry sorry I'm just saying I'm just thinking like oh he's\n\n43:32.120 --> 43:37.480\njust setting he's he's inviting us into yeah and like have you hey hey he's like\n\n43:37.480 --> 43:41.200\nbeing like Kinsey you know he's going like hey how fucking straight are you man\n\n43:41.200 --> 43:44.320\nwhen it comes to locations and times where you're making love you make love\n\n43:44.320 --> 43:48.720\nall over the place don't you including the backseat of the car okay so he's\n\n43:48.720 --> 43:53.480\nsaying are you freaky but he's saying look I'm not even that freaky I make\n\n43:53.480 --> 43:56.920\nlove sometimes before breakfast I make sometimes during the late-late show\n\n43:56.920 --> 44:03.280\nright sometimes on a couch sometimes in the back of a car I'm kind of walking\n\n44:03.280 --> 44:09.200\nyou into my world right where I am a regular person right so so and I'd be\n\n44:09.200 --> 44:13.320\nstroking on regular thing when you find out the payoff you're gonna be like well\n\n44:13.320 --> 44:17.160\nwhy did why was that plank necessary why can't you just jump into a pool this\n\n44:17.160 --> 44:22.120\nshallow because it's called it's called verse verse chorus bridge where they\n\n44:22.120 --> 44:26.200\ntake it to a nether place they walk you into across the but I will know this\n\n44:26.200 --> 44:28.840\nsong is breaking all the rules right away because the only other song that\n\n44:28.840 --> 44:33.400\ndoes this to my glee is Eric Clapton's it's in the way that you use it like you\n\n44:33.400 --> 44:37.980\nnotice he just it just starts like boom hey make a lot I've been\n\n44:37.980 --> 44:42.880\nstroking not like he doesn't even like there's no verse it's not like you know\n\n44:42.880 --> 44:46.840\nI'm gonna tell you about the wild thing for a while and then wild thing it's like\n\n44:46.840 --> 44:50.440\nhe kind of like gets into it okay take us to the bridge take us to the bridge\n\n44:50.440 --> 44:58.200\nall right here we go if I can maybe I'll take us to the door\n\n44:58.200 --> 45:08.760\nokay so I just want to speak on behalf of the police there in that situation\n\n45:08.760 --> 45:15.600\nsay still the same charges apply sir I don't know if you're if you're speaking\n\n45:15.600 --> 45:21.040\nin terms of legal jurisprudence but our job is to put your dick back in your\n\n45:21.040 --> 45:25.920\npants because your car is a place where police can see it but when he goes to\n\n45:25.920 --> 45:32.000\ncourt I guarantee you his defense is gonna be define what stroking is and\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:35.720\nthat's the twist that's coming and it's coming it's coming unintentionally\n\n45:35.720 --> 45:39.160\nbecause and I don't know if it's intention I don't think it's intentional\n\n45:39.160 --> 45:43.440\nbecause there's another twist in the song that is intentional the one that's\n\n45:43.440 --> 45:48.080\nunintentional is that he finally will use stroking with it as a verb with a\n\n45:48.080 --> 45:51.800\nsubject I don't know if it's the correct term object or subject but that\n\n45:51.800 --> 45:58.000\nthere's a that he'll he'll say what he's stroking and and I'm like oh you should\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:01.760\nlead with that or not be confused about the ambiguous response because Chuck\n\n46:01.760 --> 46:05.400\nBarry would open with whatever he was stroking right so that then he can play\n\n46:05.400 --> 46:10.240\nthe game of like I've got a little bell and I call it a dingaling now let's\n\n46:10.240 --> 46:14.560\nplay fucking salty salted nuts or whatever the SNL sketch is not\n\n46:14.560 --> 46:18.520\ncomedically sophisticated that sketch oh he's back for an eighth time\n\n46:18.520 --> 46:25.520\nsalty balls what the fuck this is like a 1950s joke okay so just to me that line\n\n46:25.520 --> 46:30.040\nthat we just heard changes changes the meaning of the past lines because he's\n\n46:30.040 --> 46:33.400\nsaying all this stuff and it sounds braggartly but now he's telling this\n\n46:33.400 --> 46:38.440\nstory and so it recontextualizes the early line such that it sounds like he's\n\n46:38.440 --> 46:42.560\nsaying he's trying to come up with a way to relate to you he's like oh you ever\n\n46:42.560 --> 46:48.360\nhave sex on a on a on a couch no no well what about in the backseat of the car\n\n46:48.360 --> 46:53.000\nokay okay well I was having sex on the backseat of the car and a guy came up\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:57.320\nand so so remember I said earlier that I was stroking well that was just like\n\n46:57.320 --> 46:59.960\nthis one time while I was having sex in the back of the car and this guy comes\n\n46:59.960 --> 47:03.720\nup to me he says what are you doing I've been I've been stroking you know and now\n\n47:03.720 --> 47:07.120\nI just know to continue to explain this yeah it's also notable though that I\n\n47:07.120 --> 47:10.000\ndon't think the cops said what are you doing I think he just shines the light\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:15.760\nand he goes I'm stroking guilty conscious guilty conscious can you go back and\n\n47:15.760 --> 47:19.080\nplay that previous line okay I think it's important that we go back and\n\n47:19.080 --> 47:38.040\nrecontextualize this guy is endeavoring to explain something serious\n\n47:49.080 --> 48:02.060\nI'm not sure my dick haven't even wet\n\n48:02.060 --> 48:04.060\nOkay.\n\n48:04.060 --> 48:06.060\nLet me ask you something.\n\n48:06.060 --> 48:12.060\nHow long has it been since you made love?\n\n48:12.060 --> 48:14.060\nHuh?\n\n48:14.060 --> 48:16.060\nIt's important to find out.\n\n48:16.060 --> 48:18.060\nDid you make love yesterday?\n\n48:18.060 --> 48:20.060\nI don't remember this part.\n\n48:20.060 --> 48:24.060\nDid you make love last week?\n\n48:24.060 --> 48:26.060\nHe needs to get a baseline.\n\n48:26.060 --> 48:28.060\nAre you making love tomorrow?\n\n48:28.060 --> 48:34.060\nIt's important for this next part I'm about to explain.\n\n48:34.060 --> 48:40.060\nMaybe it might be that you're planning on making love tonight.\n\n48:40.060 --> 48:46.060\nBut just remember, when you start making love,\n\n48:46.060 --> 48:54.060\nyou're making a hard, long, soft, short, and be stroking.\n\n48:54.060 --> 48:56.060\nOkay.\n\n48:56.060 --> 48:58.060\nI don't know how long I'll be.\n\n48:58.060 --> 49:02.060\nHe said make it hard, long, soft, and short.\n\n49:02.060 --> 49:04.060\nMake it paradoxical.\n\n49:04.060 --> 49:06.060\nSex should be challenging.\n\n49:06.060 --> 49:08.060\nMake it be a...\n\n49:08.060 --> 49:12.060\nHere comes the thing that I continue to twist.\n\n49:12.060 --> 49:14.060\nIt's going to be really subtle.\n\n49:14.060 --> 49:18.060\nWhen I start making love to my woman,\n\n49:18.060 --> 49:24.060\nI don't stop until I know she's sex-ified.\n\n49:24.060 --> 49:28.060\nI always tell when she gets sex-ified.\n\n49:28.060 --> 49:30.060\nBecause when she gets sex-ified,\n\n49:30.060 --> 49:32.060\nshe started calling my name.\n\n49:32.060 --> 49:34.060\nShe said,\n\n49:34.060 --> 49:38.060\nClans caught, clans caught, clans caught, clans caught.\n\n49:38.060 --> 49:42.060\nThat's smart branding.\n\n49:42.060 --> 49:46.060\nThe other night, I was stroking my woman.\n\n49:46.060 --> 49:48.060\nThe other night, I was stroking my woman.\n\n49:48.060 --> 49:50.060\nOkay, so now he's...\n\n49:50.060 --> 49:52.060\nSo he was never talking about his cock.\n\n49:52.060 --> 49:54.060\nHe's talking about being sensual.\n\n49:54.060 --> 49:56.060\nSo now it makes sense that the cops come up\n\n49:56.060 --> 49:58.060\nand shine the light, and he goes,\n\n49:58.060 --> 50:00.060\nI'm fucking stroking, man.\n\n50:00.060 --> 50:02.060\nI have a civil right to do so.\n\n50:02.060 --> 50:04.060\nIt's a stroke.\n\n50:04.060 --> 50:06.060\nI'm fucking touching someone's skin in a way that...\n\n50:06.060 --> 50:08.060\nNo, he's talking about putting...\n\n50:08.060 --> 50:10.060\nHe's talking about the stroke of the in and out of the dick.\n\n50:10.060 --> 50:12.060\nHe just said stroking my woman.\n\n50:12.060 --> 50:14.060\nAre you saying you could use that,\n\n50:14.060 --> 50:16.060\nand it becomes kind of like stroking my woman\n\n50:16.060 --> 50:18.060\nmeans penetrating her?\n\n50:18.060 --> 50:20.060\nI think he's talking about fucking.\n\n50:20.060 --> 50:22.060\nWell, and I would say also,\n\n50:22.060 --> 50:24.060\nin contrast to my theory there,\n\n50:24.060 --> 50:26.060\nwhere I was like, oh, wait,\n\n50:26.060 --> 50:28.060\nthe joke's on me for thinking\n\n50:28.060 --> 50:30.060\nhe was talking about stroking his penis.\n\n50:30.060 --> 50:32.060\nBut in his refrain,\n\n50:32.060 --> 50:34.060\nhe says, I stroke it to the woman\n\n50:34.060 --> 50:36.060\nthat I like best,\n\n50:36.060 --> 50:38.060\nwhich means not...\n\n50:38.060 --> 50:40.060\nIt means...\n\n50:40.060 --> 50:42.060\nWhat are you stroking\n\n50:42.060 --> 50:44.060\nwhen you're stroking to something?\n\n50:44.060 --> 50:46.060\nYou can't be stroking a piano to...\n\n50:46.060 --> 50:48.060\nYeah, it's not a...\n\n50:48.060 --> 50:50.060\nIt's not an intransitive verb.\n\n50:54.060 --> 50:56.060\nBut I thought that was the twist,\n\n50:56.060 --> 50:58.060\nbut his twist is just profane.\n\n50:58.060 --> 51:00.060\nAnd it got so good to her.\n\n51:00.060 --> 51:02.060\nYou know what she told me.\n\n51:02.060 --> 51:04.060\nLet me tell you what she told me.\n\n51:04.060 --> 51:06.060\nShe said,\n\n51:06.060 --> 51:08.060\nI stroke a clenched collar,\n\n51:08.060 --> 51:10.060\nbut don't stroke so fast.\n\n51:10.060 --> 51:12.060\nIf my stuff ain't tight enough,\n\n51:12.060 --> 51:14.060\nyou can stick me up my...\n\n51:14.060 --> 51:16.060\nWell, I'd be slower.\n\n51:16.060 --> 51:18.060\nOkay, well...\n\n51:18.060 --> 51:20.060\nDamn.\n\n51:20.060 --> 51:22.060\nIs that a problem she was anticipating?\n\n51:22.060 --> 51:24.060\nThe defense rests.\n\n51:24.060 --> 51:26.060\nHa, ha, ha!\n\n51:26.060 --> 51:28.060\nYeah, I...\n\n51:28.060 --> 51:30.060\nI mean, the case closed.\n\n51:30.060 --> 51:32.060\nIf it's not...\n\n51:32.060 --> 51:34.060\nHe's talking about fucking...\n\n51:34.060 --> 51:36.060\nHe's talking about fucking a pussy,\n\n51:36.060 --> 51:38.060\nand then he goes, oh, also,\n\n51:38.060 --> 51:40.060\nif her stuff is too tight...\n\n51:40.060 --> 51:42.060\nIf it's too tight, how is your ass looser?\n\n51:42.060 --> 51:44.060\nBut then...\n\n51:44.060 --> 51:46.060\nWhat kind of woman are you\n\n51:46.060 --> 51:48.060\nbringing home with you, Clarence Carter?\n\n51:48.060 --> 51:50.060\nBut then...\n\n51:50.060 --> 51:52.060\nIf my vagina's too tight, there's always my ass.\n\n51:52.060 --> 51:54.060\nBut then...\n\n51:54.060 --> 51:56.060\nWhat is that moment to get demure\n\n51:56.060 --> 51:58.060\nand not say the word ass?\n\n51:58.060 --> 52:00.060\nI know, well, because he's...\n\n52:00.060 --> 52:02.060\nThat's the one thing that I'm thinking,\n\n52:02.060 --> 52:04.060\nlike, you know what she said to me?\n\n52:04.060 --> 52:06.060\nHe just sings the rest of it, and then he finishes the song.\n\n52:06.060 --> 52:08.060\nBut, like, he might be thinking,\n\n52:08.060 --> 52:10.060\nlike, you know what, and then I stop dating her,\n\n52:10.060 --> 52:12.060\nbecause I'm not doing that.\n\n52:12.060 --> 52:14.060\nWell, I be strokin'.\n\n52:14.060 --> 52:16.060\nI mean, like, a neck rub.\n\n52:16.060 --> 52:18.060\nLike, I'm like, I like to cuddle.\n\n52:18.060 --> 52:20.060\nBut that's not the case.\n\n52:20.060 --> 52:22.060\nAnyways, well, that's the song strokin', babe.\n\n52:22.060 --> 52:24.060\nIt's just good that he...\n\n52:24.060 --> 52:26.060\nWhen he gave that story,\n\n52:26.060 --> 52:28.060\nit's good that he found out how often\n\n52:28.060 --> 52:30.060\nwe have sex and whether or not\n\n52:30.060 --> 52:32.060\nwe've done it on a couch.\n\n52:32.060 --> 52:34.060\nOtherwise, how could we possibly have understood\n\n52:34.060 --> 52:36.060\nthat when her stuff is too tight,\n\n52:36.060 --> 52:38.060\nwe could do it there?\n\n52:38.060 --> 52:40.060\nYou know what?\n\n52:40.060 --> 52:42.060\nWhat it's called...\n\n52:42.060 --> 52:44.060\nIt wouldn't make any sense with all that buildup.\n\n52:44.060 --> 52:46.060\nIt's called accusing the accuser.\n\n52:46.060 --> 52:48.060\nOh, well, last time you had sex on a couch.\n\n52:48.060 --> 52:50.060\nRight. I didn't say you weren't strokin', buddy.\n\n52:50.060 --> 52:52.060\nOh, really?\n\n52:52.060 --> 52:54.060\nWhen was the last time you had sex?\n\n52:54.060 --> 52:56.060\nI'm not saying you did it.\n\n52:56.060 --> 52:58.060\nWas it last night?\n\n52:58.060 --> 53:00.060\nThat's not relevant.\n\n53:00.060 --> 53:02.060\nHow is that a way to respond\n\n53:02.060 --> 53:04.060\nto police shining a light on you?\n\n53:04.060 --> 53:06.060\nI guess he's saying, like,\n\n53:06.060 --> 53:08.060\nyou got a fucking problem? I'm strokin'.\n\n53:08.060 --> 53:10.060\nIt's just him being defiant.\n\n53:10.060 --> 53:12.060\nHe's going, like, why don't you take a picture\n\n53:12.060 --> 53:14.060\nof the last longer?\n\n53:14.060 --> 53:16.060\nI'm fucking strokin'.\n\n53:16.060 --> 53:18.060\nI'm not stealing. I'm not fucking...\n\n53:18.060 --> 53:20.060\nI'm not stealing his own.\n\n53:20.060 --> 53:22.060\nYou very understandably took it to a place\n\n53:22.060 --> 53:24.060\nwhere if a guy starts talking about I be strokin',\n\n53:24.060 --> 53:26.060\nit sounds like he's masturbating.\n\n53:26.060 --> 53:28.060\nIt turns out, no, he's...\n\n53:28.060 --> 53:30.060\nHe just...\n\n53:30.060 --> 53:32.060\nHe wants anal sex and is not getting it\n\n53:32.060 --> 53:34.060\nbecause the police are on his fucking ass.\n\n53:34.060 --> 53:36.060\nBut also, like, is he just describing...\n\n53:36.060 --> 53:38.060\nHe's just describing the...\n\n53:38.060 --> 53:40.060\nWhen I'm making love, I don't...\n\n53:40.060 --> 53:42.060\nIt's not just making love. I have a special name for it.\n\n53:42.060 --> 53:44.060\nOh, yeah. That's not a nice...\n\n53:44.060 --> 53:46.060\nI do it differently. I do it better.\n\n53:46.060 --> 53:48.060\nI call it strokin'.\n\n53:48.060 --> 53:50.060\nI'm not going to call it making love\n\n53:50.060 --> 53:52.060\nbecause you're a fucking plebe, okay?\n\n53:52.060 --> 53:54.060\nYou make love like a fucking barn animal\n\n53:54.060 --> 53:56.060\nor a priest.\n\n53:56.060 --> 53:58.060\nI'm gonna...\n\n53:58.060 --> 54:00.060\nI'm a fucking hero when I make love.\n\n54:00.060 --> 54:02.060\nI'm a trademarkable fucking, like,\n\n54:02.060 --> 54:04.060\nbrandy...\n\n54:04.060 --> 54:06.060\nWait, sir?
