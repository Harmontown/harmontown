{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:24.520\nHello Meltdown, how are you all tonight?\n\n00:24.520 --> 00:31.880\nOnce again, Harmontown is in session in Hollywood, California at the comfortable confines of\n\n00:31.880 --> 00:33.760\nMeltdown Comics, NerdMelt Theater.\n\n00:33.760 --> 00:48.800\nWon't you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:48.800 --> 00:50.520\nWe have so much to do tonight.\n\n00:50.520 --> 00:52.520\nWhat the fuck?\n\n00:52.520 --> 00:56.320\nAll right, thank you.\n\n00:56.320 --> 01:03.400\nAll right, tonight's theme is litany, tonight's theme is lists, all right?\n\n01:03.400 --> 01:05.680\nTonight's theme is items on the docket.\n\n01:05.680 --> 01:08.160\nI've got a pad of paper and a pen.\n\n01:08.160 --> 01:13.360\nI've got a Samsung giant phone, I've got Evernote, I've got a list of shit I want to talk about\n\n01:13.360 --> 01:14.360\ntonight.\n\n01:14.360 --> 01:17.880\nWe're going to do it fast because I just got a note from you in the green room, oh the\n\n01:17.880 --> 01:22.360\nshows are too long, they're getting too long, 90 minutes, let's make it 90 minutes.\n\n01:22.360 --> 01:29.840\nYeah, he's like the noid, he's like the noid, he's our enemy.\n\n01:29.840 --> 01:33.800\nNobody wants a two hour show, two hours is too long.\n\n01:33.800 --> 01:42.680\nAll right, let's fuck, settle in, I hope he brought some snacks.\n\n01:42.680 --> 01:47.240\nIn Jeff's defense, if we target a 90 minute show, it's a two hour show, so it's like\n\n01:47.240 --> 01:51.840\nJesus Christ, like if you try to be a good person, you end up like okay, yeah, all right,\n\n01:51.840 --> 01:56.120\nyou chart that star, you don't expect to hit it.\n\n01:56.120 --> 01:57.120\nThank you ma'am.\n\n01:57.120 --> 02:00.880\nSomebody yelled out, tweeted, all right, item number one on the list, let's just barrel\n\n02:00.880 --> 02:02.600\nthrough it, let's barrel through it.\n\n02:02.600 --> 02:07.320\nThe only thing I thought of today, this is from the Rob Delaney department, where I'm\n\n02:07.320 --> 02:14.360\nlike, in other words, I thought this was clever, okay, you know how when you die you poop your\n\n02:14.360 --> 02:21.520\npants, okay, here's how you solve all of the world's problems, in my opinion, and I don't\n\n02:21.520 --> 02:24.680\nknow how to enforce this, I don't know how to create this environment, but this would\n\n02:24.680 --> 02:27.000\nsolve all the world's problems.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:32.320\nWhen you die, instead of pooping your own pants, you get to choose whose pants you poop\n\n02:32.320 --> 02:33.320\nin.\n\n02:33.320 --> 02:37.000\nWait, you can create poop in somebody else's pants?\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:44.840\nEvery, yeah, every, yeah, so like, every human being on earth, so dick chainie's pants\n\n02:44.840 --> 02:46.480\nwould constantly be filled with shit.\n\n02:46.480 --> 02:51.040\nThere would be no dick chainie, he would not do the things he'd done.\n\n02:51.040 --> 02:55.680\nHe wouldn't do it, he'd go, it's not worth it.\n\n02:55.680 --> 03:00.200\nEvery minute of every day, it's like a bell ringing and an angel getting a twang, there's\n\n03:00.200 --> 03:04.720\nanother load in my fucking pants, I can't do it, it's not worth it, what's worth it?\n\n03:04.720 --> 03:10.240\nAll the oil, all the money in the world, every second another person dies that chooses me,\n\n03:10.240 --> 03:11.560\nmy pants to crap it.\n\n03:11.560 --> 03:15.160\nAlso, if you murder somebody and get away with it, the person that you kill gets to poop\n\n03:15.160 --> 03:16.320\nin your pants at any time.\n\n03:16.320 --> 03:20.040\nOh, you know they will, you know they will, that's the least they can do.\n\n03:20.040 --> 03:27.360\nIt's like the game of werewolf, there's a card that you rarely use, I think it's like\n\n03:27.360 --> 03:31.120\na hunter or something and it's like when the werewolf kills the hunter, the hunter gets\n\n03:31.120 --> 03:33.880\nto actually pick somebody to take out as they go out.\n\n03:33.880 --> 03:38.580\nIf everyone had that power, no one would fucking, it's the perfect blend, there's too many people\n\n03:38.580 --> 03:43.120\nin this world that chooses a religion, like this idea that they're going to be punished\n\n03:43.120 --> 03:46.200\nin the afterlife, that's fucked up because that means you're not on your best behavior\n\n03:46.200 --> 03:47.840\nin this world.\n\n03:47.840 --> 03:52.800\nYou think too much about the afterlife, it's too stupid, it's dumb, you know and then the\n\n03:52.800 --> 03:56.400\nother end of the spectrum you have like atheists who are like well, you know what's happening\n\n03:56.400 --> 04:00.160\nright here is what's important but they don't have a god so they're not accountable to anything.\n\n04:00.160 --> 04:06.480\nThe perfect mix, the perfect karmic mix, okay there is no afterlife, fuck that but on your\n\n04:06.480 --> 04:10.600\nway out of the game you get to shit in someone's pants, who's it going to be?\n\n04:10.600 --> 04:14.920\nAlright, let's say Dan, let's say you get a piano falls through the ceiling right now\n\n04:14.920 --> 04:16.800\nand crushes you and you die.\n\n04:16.800 --> 04:22.080\nThen I get to go, time freezes as I die and Gabriel comes down or if you prefer Allah\n\n04:22.080 --> 04:32.240\nor Giuseppe, whatever your religion is, if you're Muslim or Italian or if you're a fan\n\n04:32.240 --> 04:37.440\nof Half-Life, that snake guy comes out with a suit and the briefcase and goes, Mr. Gooden,\n\n04:37.440 --> 04:46.520\ngood job, it seems the game is over, I expected a bigger response from my crowd for the Half-Life\n\n04:46.520 --> 04:50.400\nreference.\n\n04:50.400 --> 04:51.400\nWhat's his name?\n\n04:51.400 --> 04:52.400\nG-Man, yeah.\n\n04:52.400 --> 04:58.280\nThey freeze time and they go, whose pants would you like to shit in and then you get\n\n04:58.280 --> 04:59.280\na brief dialogue.\n\n04:59.280 --> 05:01.080\nWait, Vincent Price comes to you?\n\n05:01.080 --> 05:05.840\nYeah, kind of, yeah, Vincent Price, that's about it, you get to choose the form of your\n\n05:05.840 --> 05:06.840\nshit accountant.\n\n05:06.840 --> 05:07.840\nThis is getting better.\n\n05:07.840 --> 05:12.840\nYeah, yeah, you get to choose, Gene Hackman comes out, good job, who's pants do you want\n\n05:12.840 --> 05:17.560\nto shit in, soldier, I got Gene Hackman, I would like to know more about this piano that\n\n05:17.560 --> 05:21.800\nfell on me, this good, good, good, I like your style, soldier.\n\n05:21.800 --> 05:24.840\nYou move up and you see the guy that dropped the piano, I go, okay, why did he drop the\n\n05:24.840 --> 05:25.840\npiano?\n\n05:25.840 --> 05:30.560\nYou get to spend, I don't know, you get a half hour or you get to move around with the camera,\n\n05:30.560 --> 05:32.320\nit's like the Half-Life source engineer.\n\n05:32.320 --> 05:37.520\nDoes the person who poops their pants know that this is a ghost poop, know that this\n\n05:37.520 --> 05:42.520\nis, no, they don't, they don't, they don't, you never know, if you're walking, so there's\n\n05:42.520 --> 05:46.120\npeople on this earth that are walking around and they're like, oh, man, I'm such a real\n\n05:46.120 --> 05:55.640\nestate mogul, who did that, fuck you, you don't know, but be nice tomorrow, motherfucker,\n\n05:55.640 --> 05:56.640\nbe nice.\n\n05:56.640 --> 05:59.160\nYou've revealed that you poop your pants a lot throughout the year, you're just going\n\n05:59.160 --> 06:03.360\nto think that you're a terrible person, no, no, come on, you're normally pooping, silly,\n\n06:03.360 --> 06:08.920\nthat's dumb, it's not dumb, no, no, no, you have admitted that you poop your pants from\n\n06:08.920 --> 06:09.920\ntime to time.\n\n06:09.920 --> 06:14.440\nBut it always follows me going, I think I have a fart coming.\n\n06:14.440 --> 06:15.440\nThis follows nothing.\n\n06:15.440 --> 06:16.440\nOh, so you'll know.\n\n06:16.440 --> 06:19.400\nYou're in line at the bank and then your pants are filled with shit.\n\n06:19.400 --> 06:25.520\nIt doesn't come out of your butt, it suddenly teleports into your pants, you're about to\n\n06:25.520 --> 06:31.280\ncash a check and you have shit in my pants and everyone's going, what smells, who smells,\n\n06:31.280 --> 06:33.120\nwhat smells, oh, who's that guy?\n\n06:33.120 --> 06:39.000\nAnd you know, it's like a comment section, like, okay, maybe that person, maybe the person\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:43.960\nthat pooped in his pants is crazy, maybe, given the benefit of the doubt, because if\n\n06:43.960 --> 06:48.600\nyou don't, if you punish him too hard, if you go, hey, stinky, who'd you fuck over?\n\n06:48.600 --> 06:53.980\nHe might shit in your pants when he dies, so keep a low profile, that's the natural\n\n06:53.980 --> 06:57.160\neffect it's going to have on our national psyche.\n\n06:57.160 --> 06:59.600\nOne death, one shit, you get to poop in one person's pants.\n\n06:59.600 --> 07:04.240\nOne solid fucking chunky poop in the pants of your choosing.\n\n07:04.240 --> 07:09.960\nAll right, Dan, let's say God forbid you drop dead tonight, and who would I choose?\n\n07:09.960 --> 07:11.880\nWho's your poop accountant?\n\n07:11.880 --> 07:15.200\nYour poop, your poop meister?\n\n07:15.200 --> 07:17.120\nJust off the top of my head, Bruce Valanche.\n\n07:17.120 --> 07:18.120\nBruce Valanche.\n\n07:18.120 --> 07:21.960\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, not who's pants do you poop in?\n\n07:21.960 --> 07:22.960\nOh, oh, oh, oh, sorry.\n\n07:22.960 --> 07:23.960\nFirst, who's your Gene Hackman?\n\n07:23.960 --> 07:24.960\nWho do you pick?\n\n07:24.960 --> 07:25.960\nOh, oh, oh, who's my gozer?\n\n07:25.960 --> 07:26.960\nYeah.\n\n07:26.960 --> 07:27.960\nLike my anti-gozer?\n\n07:27.960 --> 07:28.960\nYeah.\n\n07:28.960 --> 07:29.960\nTop of your head.\n\n07:29.960 --> 07:30.960\nTop of your head.\n\n07:30.960 --> 07:31.960\nNoam Chomsky.\n\n07:31.960 --> 07:32.960\nNoam Chomsky.\n\n07:32.960 --> 07:34.960\nNoam Chomsky.\n\n07:34.960 --> 07:36.960\nNo, he's alive.\n\n07:36.960 --> 07:37.960\nNo, he's alive.\n\n07:37.960 --> 07:38.960\nThey don't have to be dead.\n\n07:38.960 --> 07:43.960\nI'm going to, you know, fuck you, Juliet, I'm going to shit your pants when I die.\n\n07:43.960 --> 07:50.960\nAll right, so Noam Chomsky comes out and says, taking time out of his trench into social\n\n07:50.960 --> 07:56.800\ncommentaries, and you tell him you want to poop in Bruce Valanche's pants.\n\n07:56.800 --> 07:57.800\nYeah.\n\n07:57.800 --> 07:58.800\nAnd I tell him why.\n\n07:58.800 --> 08:02.680\nAnd I get to, and he, no matter what, it's like contact, you know, Jody Foster's dad.\n\n08:02.680 --> 08:06.560\nLike, he's a projector, so no matter what, Noam Chomsky's not going to go, Dan, don't\n\n08:06.560 --> 08:07.560\nbe petty.\n\n08:07.560 --> 08:09.280\nNoam Chomsky's going to go, you know what?\n\n08:09.280 --> 08:16.280\nI discovered language at MIT, and I'm the foremost dissenter of American foreign policy.\n\n08:16.280 --> 08:17.920\nBruce Valanche, good choice, Dan.\n\n08:17.920 --> 08:18.920\nYeah.\n\n08:18.920 --> 08:22.400\nAnd that's like, that's the joy you carry into the afterlife, into oblivion.\n\n08:22.400 --> 08:24.920\nBut you can't leave a calling card.\n\n08:24.920 --> 08:29.360\nThey don't know who's, I don't want them to, because that's the important thing.\n\n08:29.360 --> 08:34.200\nBecause then you start, here's what, here's what, here's what, here's what, here's what,\n\n08:34.200 --> 08:37.560\nhere's what, here's what Dick Cheney'll do.\n\n08:37.560 --> 08:38.680\nHere's what Dick Cheney'll do.\n\n08:38.680 --> 08:43.080\nHe'll go to the Pentagon, he'll go in the basement and go, wah, wah, I need you to invent\n\n08:43.080 --> 08:49.960\na device that flags all the shit coming into my pants and separates it, each name, if there's\n\n08:49.960 --> 08:54.480\na name tag, I want you to track it, track it, and all their families go to Guantanamo.\n\n08:54.480 --> 08:55.480\nSee?\n\n08:55.480 --> 08:56.480\nHa, ha, ha, ha.\n\n08:56.480 --> 08:58.160\nLike, I don't want any of that shit.\n\n08:58.160 --> 09:02.320\nI want him to just have shit in his pants, so the volume of it is a measure of people's\n\n09:02.320 --> 09:03.320\nanger against it.\n\n09:03.320 --> 09:04.320\nYeah.\n\n09:04.320 --> 09:05.320\nThat's it.\n\n09:05.320 --> 09:06.880\nLike, why is this, what the fuck did I do?\n\n09:06.880 --> 09:11.800\nI'll tell you what you did, motherfucker, you fucked around too much with too many people.\n\n09:11.800 --> 09:13.720\nYou got too high on the radar.\n\n09:13.720 --> 09:14.720\nBut Dan.\n\n09:14.720 --> 09:15.720\nWelcome to America.\n\n09:15.720 --> 09:17.720\nOkay, here, I have a, I found a-\n\n09:17.720 --> 09:19.720\nYou got a bunch of shit in your pants.\n\n09:19.720 --> 09:20.720\nClean it up.\n\n09:20.720 --> 09:21.720\nI have found-\n\n09:21.720 --> 09:27.840\nIf you're going to be famous, be cool, be friendly, be nice, be Mother Teresa.\n\n09:27.840 --> 09:31.640\nIf you're going to be famous, if you're going to be on a coffee cup, be on a coffee cup\n\n09:31.640 --> 09:33.440\nbecause you're the coolest person in the world.\n\n09:33.440 --> 09:36.440\nAnd then every once in a while, still, you'll be driving down Hollywood Boulevard, like,\n\n09:36.440 --> 09:39.400\noh, okay, some 15-year-old asshole wanted to fuck with it.\n\n09:39.400 --> 09:40.400\nOkay, fine.\n\n09:40.400 --> 09:46.160\nYeah, but aren't famous, you've read comment sections after an episode of a show that you've\n\n09:46.160 --> 09:47.160\nmade.\n\n09:47.160 --> 09:48.160\nYeah.\n\n09:48.160 --> 09:49.160\nPeople are petty.\n\n09:49.160 --> 09:50.160\nWell, I'm an asshole.\n\n09:50.160 --> 09:51.160\nYeah.\n\n09:51.160 --> 09:52.160\nI am partially an asshole, you know?\n\n09:52.160 --> 09:53.160\nLike-\n\n09:53.160 --> 09:55.160\nHow much, if this went into effect, how many-\n\n09:55.160 --> 09:58.960\nIf it's consigned into law.\n\n09:58.960 --> 10:02.040\nHere's hoping it does.\n\n10:02.040 --> 10:05.680\nIt seems like a long shot, but if it does go into effect-\n\n10:05.680 --> 10:09.040\nHow many times do you think people are going to die and on their deathbed make you poop?\n\n10:09.040 --> 10:13.040\nHonestly, like, do you think there's thousands, hundreds, well, yeah, I don't know.\n\n10:13.040 --> 10:14.040\nStrangers?\n\n10:14.040 --> 10:15.040\nYeah.\n\n10:15.040 --> 10:16.040\nReally?\n\n10:16.040 --> 10:17.040\nWell, no, no, no, that's not true because you only get one.\n\n10:17.040 --> 10:18.040\nYou get one.\n\n10:18.040 --> 10:19.040\nSo you get passed up, you know?\n\n10:19.040 --> 10:20.520\nWho's going to use it too ironically?\n\n10:20.520 --> 10:21.520\nYeah.\n\n10:21.520 --> 10:22.520\nYou know?\n\n10:22.520 --> 10:23.520\nLike, when I go-\n\n10:23.520 --> 10:25.520\nYeah, first and foremost, by the way-\n\n10:25.520 --> 10:26.520\nYeah, Kevin Smith.\n\n10:26.520 --> 10:27.520\nI'll tell you what.\n\n10:27.520 --> 10:28.520\nYou know what?\n\n10:28.520 --> 10:29.520\nYou know who's going to get the most?\n\n10:29.520 --> 10:30.520\nYou.\n\n10:30.520 --> 10:31.520\nBecause it's your idea.\n\n10:31.520 --> 10:33.000\nI don't get credit for the idea.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:36.760\nI don't want that.\n\n10:36.760 --> 10:37.760\nThat's not cool.\n\n10:37.760 --> 10:39.200\nYou can't do that because then everyone's doing it.\n\n10:39.200 --> 10:40.200\nBecause everyone-\n\n10:40.200 --> 10:43.000\nAfter I make this happen, everyone's going to resent the-\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:44.000\nYeah.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.840\nLike, you know, I don't

seen it?\n\n17:57.320 --> 17:58.160\nIs it out in theaters?\n\n17:58.160 --> 17:59.000\nHow do you know?\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.720\nIt's been really long trailers and it's been around.\n\n18:01.720 --> 18:03.840\nThey've been talking about it for a while now.\n\n18:03.840 --> 18:05.440\nAre you excited about it?\n\n18:05.440 --> 18:08.080\nI'm gonna see it, because I like superhero movies, so...\n\n18:08.080 --> 18:11.760\nBut are you a Superman guy or are you like Batman guy?\n\n18:11.760 --> 18:12.960\n90's Superman.\n\n18:12.960 --> 18:14.240\nI know a lot of...\n\n18:14.240 --> 18:15.320\nLike, what does that mean?\n\n18:15.320 --> 18:16.160\nSmall though?\n\n18:16.160 --> 18:18.040\n90's to 2000.\n\n18:18.040 --> 18:18.880\nComics.\n\n18:18.880 --> 18:22.120\nOh, in the comic, they actually made Superman appealing?\n\n18:22.120 --> 18:22.960\nYeah, yeah.\n\n18:22.960 --> 18:24.640\nYou know what I just found out about Superman?\n\n18:24.640 --> 18:26.400\nI never understood the appeal of Superman.\n\n18:26.400 --> 18:27.240\nI never got it.\n\n18:27.240 --> 18:29.000\nLike, what does it mean?\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:29.840\nDo you have Batman?\n\n18:29.840 --> 18:30.680\nWe have Spider-Man.\n\n18:30.680 --> 18:31.520\nYou can see the appeal.\n\n18:31.520 --> 18:32.560\nGranted, all these things came after Superman.\n\n18:32.560 --> 18:35.320\nWe developed the idea of a Superman.\n\n18:35.320 --> 18:37.720\nAnd then everything else is a commentary after that.\n\n18:37.720 --> 18:40.320\nIt's like, if you watch Easy Rider and you don't like it,\n\n18:40.320 --> 18:42.640\nyou can't necessarily say Easy Rider is a bad movie\n\n18:42.640 --> 18:45.240\nbecause so much shit was influenced by this weird...\n\n18:45.240 --> 18:47.040\nDennis Hopper's high and he's got a camera.\n\n18:47.040 --> 18:49.680\nBut it's Superman.\n\n18:49.680 --> 18:51.040\nI didn't know this about the history of it.\n\n18:51.040 --> 18:55.880\nIt was created by two Jewish brothers, I think.\n\n18:55.880 --> 18:59.080\nAnd they were during the time when Jewish people\n\n18:59.080 --> 19:02.760\nwere incredibly feeling like, what is wrong with us?\n\n19:02.760 --> 19:05.320\nWhy does this keep happening?\n\n19:05.320 --> 19:09.480\nShould I start feeling bad about myself officially?\n\n19:09.480 --> 19:11.880\nAnd they created this character that was like,\n\n19:11.880 --> 19:14.800\nthey should have put a little super hat on his head\n\n19:14.800 --> 19:18.040\nand had him be able to throw it and decapitate Nazis and stuff.\n\n19:18.040 --> 19:19.440\nSuper Yarmulke?\n\n19:19.440 --> 19:20.160\nSo that we could under...\n\n19:20.160 --> 19:21.880\nBecause I never got it.\n\n19:21.880 --> 19:24.160\nBut they were expressing...\n\n19:24.160 --> 19:26.000\nMaybe that is the...\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.440\nWhen we do keep Superman around,\n\n19:28.440 --> 19:30.120\nmaybe we're all feeling that, like,\n\n19:30.120 --> 19:32.400\nthat fuck you, you know, just that one impulse of like,\n\n19:32.400 --> 19:35.200\nfuck you, fuck you, like that.\n\n19:35.200 --> 19:36.320\nThat makes me like him.\n\n19:36.320 --> 19:38.480\nOther than that, I'm like, what the fuck are you?\n\n19:38.480 --> 19:40.880\nLike, even in the movies, he loses his powers,\n\n19:40.880 --> 19:41.880\nhe gets beat up in a truck stop,\n\n19:41.880 --> 19:43.200\nand then that whole movie is supposed to be\n\n19:43.200 --> 19:44.720\nthe coolest Superman movie, and then he goes back\n\n19:44.720 --> 19:46.840\nand then he beats the shit out of a truck driver.\n\n19:46.840 --> 19:49.840\nThe worst, like, to me growing up,\n\n19:49.840 --> 19:51.840\nlower middle class in Wisconsin,\n\n19:51.840 --> 19:54.360\nwas like, Batman, I like, because my fantasy is,\n\n19:54.360 --> 19:56.560\nI want to be rich, and if I was rich,\n\n19:56.560 --> 19:57.840\nI wouldn't fuck around with my money.\n\n19:57.840 --> 19:59.840\nI'd use it to fight crime and word.\n\n19:59.840 --> 20:02.120\nLike, I would make a super car,\n\n20:02.120 --> 20:03.200\nand I'd have cameras everywhere,\n\n20:03.200 --> 20:04.800\nand I'd go out and I'd kick some ass.\n\n20:04.800 --> 20:05.640\nLike, green hornet?\n\n20:05.640 --> 20:07.000\nYeah, yeah, sure.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:07.840\nYeah.\n\n20:07.840 --> 20:10.200\nAnd Spider-Man, too, is the same thing.\n\n20:10.200 --> 20:12.120\nLike, oh, you're a teenager, you find out you're talented,\n\n20:12.120 --> 20:13.280\nand then how do you deal with it?\n\n20:13.280 --> 20:14.880\nThe answer is wisecracking, you know?\n\n20:14.880 --> 20:16.840\nLike, you get out there.\n\n20:16.840 --> 20:18.200\nBut Superman was always like,\n\n20:18.200 --> 20:19.760\noh, you're born special, boo-hoo.\n\n20:19.760 --> 20:22.480\nLike, jerk off in a cup, pour it on your head, you.\n\n20:22.480 --> 20:27.480\nThat's his weakness.\n\n20:27.480 --> 20:30.280\nOh, his own cum touches him,\n\n20:30.280 --> 20:32.920\nand he's like, oh, I'm my own worst enemy.\n\n20:32.920 --> 20:36.080\nNow, when you remind me where I'm from,\n\n20:36.080 --> 20:38.280\nI start to get weak.\n\n20:38.280 --> 20:41.040\nSo dumb, it's just so dumb.\n\n20:41.040 --> 20:43.960\nBut the Jew thing, like, really lifts it up.\n\n20:46.960 --> 20:49.040\nThat's the dash of pepper that every omelet needs.\n\n20:49.040 --> 20:52.600\nLike, huh, this needs a little, like, gritty,\n\n20:52.600 --> 20:56.440\nlike, fucking, yeah, there's a lot of human emotion there.\n\n20:56.440 --> 20:58.000\nShould have put that on the cover.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nSuperman, and then the subheading,\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:03.280\nlike, an expression of Jewish rage.\n\n21:04.480 --> 21:06.680\nAnd then I'd be like, oh, shit, this is valuable.\n\n21:06.680 --> 21:08.520\nLike, that mouse comic.\n\n21:11.440 --> 21:13.280\nLike, go valuable, if I don't like this,\n\n21:13.280 --> 21:14.880\nI'm a bad person, you know?\n\n21:14.880 --> 21:17.520\nLike, this is important culturally.\n\n21:17.520 --> 21:18.680\nSorry, what was your name, Vest?\n\n21:18.680 --> 21:19.520\nJeremy.\n\n21:19.520 --> 21:20.720\nJeremy.\n\n21:20.720 --> 21:21.960\nHe's wearing a vest.\n\n21:21.960 --> 21:24.160\nI don't know why I said that, it's stupid.\n\n21:25.800 --> 21:27.520\nAll right, I got a lot of shit to get through.\n\n21:27.520 --> 21:28.520\nStay there, stay there, Jeremy.\n\n21:28.520 --> 21:29.680\nYou're gonna help me.\n\n21:31.360 --> 21:33.680\nHolly Berry, Burbank Eye, Superman, Poster.\n\n21:33.680 --> 21:36.280\nAll right, all right, actually.\n\n21:36.280 --> 21:37.320\nThe trailer for that movie, by the way.\n\n21:37.320 --> 21:38.720\nYou don't watch The Bachelor, do you?\n\n21:38.720 --> 21:39.560\nNo.\n\n21:39.560 --> 21:41.080\nOkay, well, the guy dumped the girl\n\n21:41.080 --> 21:42.280\nwith one arm, apparently.\n\n21:45.400 --> 21:47.000\nIf you're not caught up, sorry.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.080\nYeah, I guess it's a spoiler.\n\n21:49.080 --> 21:51.480\nDan, aren't you supposed to be writing scripts right now\n\n21:51.480 --> 21:53.160\nfor various networks?\n\n21:53.160 --> 21:55.880\nWell, I'm on a fucking stage, what are you talking about?\n\n21:55.880 --> 21:58.680\nOh, I was just watching a lot of TV, man, you gotta.\n\n21:58.680 --> 21:59.720\nOh, no, no, Erin tells me.\n\n21:59.720 --> 22:01.400\nErin opens the window and I'm in the backyard\n\n22:01.400 --> 22:02.600\nwriting my thing and she goes,\n\n22:02.600 --> 22:04.720\nhe's dumping the girl with one arm.\n\n22:06.360 --> 22:08.040\nGet in here.\n\n22:08.040 --> 22:09.080\nShe's right to do that.\n\n22:09.080 --> 22:11.480\nIt's like, this is history, how do you do that?\n\n22:11.480 --> 22:13.800\nHow do you dump a one-armed girl?\n\n22:13.800 --> 22:16.680\nThey should have called The Bachelor this season.\n\n22:16.680 --> 22:20.760\nThe Bachelor, season 25, how do you dump a one-armed girl?\n\n22:22.200 --> 22:23.320\nIt's a good question.\n\n22:24.360 --> 22:25.560\nAgain, like the Superman thing.\n\n22:25.560 --> 22:29.240\nCome clean about what's really powering your myth, you know?\n\n22:30.840 --> 22:32.440\nAll I'm seeing is a guy in a cape,\n\n22:32.440 --> 22:34.120\njumping around, he can do anything.\n\n22:34.120 --> 22:35.720\nTell me it's about being a Jew.\n\n22:38.040 --> 22:39.640\nYou're a complicated fellow, Dan.\n\n22:41.240 --> 22:42.920\nAll right, okay, wait, Alex?\n\n22:42.920 --> 22:43.760\nJeremy.\n\n22:43.760 --> 22:46.840\nChrist.\n\n22:49.840 --> 22:51.360\nNo, wait, watch this, Jeff, watch this.\n\n22:51.360 --> 22:52.240\nShould I get a name tag?\n\n22:52.240 --> 22:54.400\nIf you wanted to be named anything, what would it be?\n\n22:55.200 --> 22:56.640\nWell, I like my name, so.\n\n22:56.640 --> 22:58.320\nAh, shit.\n\n22:58.320 --> 22:59.600\nI just thought maybe, all right.\n\n23:00.560 --> 23:02.800\nSometimes I feel like when I do that, God's working through me.\n\n23:03.680 --> 23:04.240\nJeremy?\n\n23:04.240 --> 23:05.440\nThat sometimes is just bad with names.\n\n23:05.440 --> 23:08.240\nJeremy, the ghost poop law is an effect.\n\n23:09.280 --> 23:10.240\nWho's passed you poop?\n\n23:10.240 --> 23:11.840\nWho's passed you poop if you drop dead to me?\n\n23:11.840 --> 23:14.080\nUh, one of the high school bullies.\n\n23:14.080 --> 23:14.880\nReally?\n\n23:14.880 --> 23:15.440\nWhat's his name?\n\n23:15.440 --> 23:15.920\nWhat's his name?\n\n23:15.920 --> 23:19.200\nUh, I'd have to narrow it down for that.\n\n23:19.200 --> 23:21.360\nOh, just what you have to.\n\n23:21.360 --> 23:22.240\nYou're dying.\n\n23:22.240 --> 23:23.440\nGene Hackman's asking you.\n\n23:24.320 --> 23:26.720\nFirst of all, who is your poop mentor?\n\n23:26.720 --> 23:28.400\nMy poop mentor?\n\n23:28.400 --> 23:29.600\nYeah, who's your Gene Hackman?\n\n23:29.600 --> 23:30.800\nWho's your young child?\n\n23:30.800 --> 23:31.600\nChristopher Walken.\n\n23:31.600 --> 23:32.560\nChristopher Walken comes with us.\n\n23:32.560 --> 23:34.000\nChristopher Walken comes down.\n\n23:35.040 --> 23:37.520\nAnd Jeff, he says what?\n\n23:37.520 --> 23:42.400\nHe says, hi, you're dead.\n\n23:44.320 --> 23:46.560\nSorry, you're so young.\n\n23:48.800 --> 23:49.520\nNice vest.\n\n23:56.640 --> 23:58.000\nHave you seen that Superman movie?\n\n23:59.360 --> 24:00.880\nI gotta have more cavill.\n\n24:00.880 --> 24:05.760\nOh, sorry, that's even hack for me.\n\n24:08.080 --> 24:08.960\nWho do you want to poop?\n\n24:11.360 --> 24:12.400\nWho are you going to poop?\n\n24:12.400 --> 24:17.600\nYeah, whose pants do you want to fill with poo?\n\n24:19.840 --> 24:20.400\nIt's your right.\n\n24:20.400 --> 24:21.280\nIt's a dead person.\n\n24:24.320 --> 24:24.880\nTick tock.\n\n24:26.720 --> 24:28.480\nI'm a pretty popular poop mentor.\n\n24:28.480 --> 24:32.000\nBut also, you have 10 minutes to ask Christopher Walken anything.\n\n24:32.880 --> 24:34.080\nAsk him any question you want.\n\n24:38.240 --> 24:39.040\nPut on the spot.\n\n24:39.040 --> 24:40.080\nIt'd be so difficult.\n\n24:40.080 --> 24:40.560\nIt's all right.\n\n24:41.520 --> 24:41.840\nYeah.\n\n24:42.560 --> 24:43.840\nAre you of legal drinking age?\n\n24:43.840 --> 24:44.400\nOh, yeah.\n\n24:44.400 --> 24:45.360\nDo you want a vodka?\n\n24:45.360 --> 24:45.760\nThere you go.\n\n24:45.760 --> 24:46.720\nThat's your prize for coming up.\n\n24:46.720 --> 24:46.880\nCool.\n\n24:47.680 --> 24:48.240\nCome on.\n\n24:48.240 --> 24:49.200\nJeremy, whose pants do you poop?\n\n24:49.200 --> 24:49.600\nOh, let's see.\n\n24:53.440 --> 24:55.200\nWe got a lot of shit to get through the show.\n\n24:55.200 --> 24:55.200\nChris.\n\n24:55.200 --> 24:55.760\nChris.\n\n24:55.760 --> 24:56.160\nHuh?\n\n24:56.160 --> 24:56.720\nChris.\n\n24:56.720 --> 24:57.280\nChris.\n\n24:57.280 --> 24:58.480\nHe's a high school bully?\n\n24:58.480 --> 24:59.120\nHe was.\n\n24:59.120 --> 24:59.440\nRight?\n\n24:59.440 --> 25:00.080\nNot anymore.\n\n25:00.080 --> 25:00.640\nThat would be weird.\n\n25:00.640 --> 25:01.920\nWhat did you tell us specifically?\n\n25:01.920 --> 25:03.120\nWhat's your memory of Chris?\n\n25:03.120 --> 25:03.760\nWhat did he do to you?\n\n25:05.440 --> 25:08.160\nWell, one of the, actually, no, I switch it.\n\n25:08.160 --> 25:08.960\nJustin.\n\n25:09.840 --> 25:10.640\nJustin Thomas.\n\n25:13.280 --> 25:14.720\nYou can bleep that out.\n\n25:14.720 --> 25:15.520\nHe's time out.\n\n25:17.520 --> 25:18.000\nJustin Thomas.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:18.480\nWhat did he do?\n\n25:18.480 --> 25:18.960\nWhat did he do?\n\n25:20.320 --> 25:21.040\nOne memory.\n\n25:21.040 --> 25:24.560\nRegular, weekly, he would, if I had to leave the classroom,\n\n25:24.560 --> 25:26.560\nhe would flip my bag inside out.\n\n25:26.560 --> 25:28.160\nWhat does that mean?\n\n25:28.160 --> 25:30.080\nLike a book bag or a backpack?\n\n25:30.080 --> 25:31.040\nYeah, take your book bag.\n\n25:31.040 --> 25:34.320\nIt's a weird thing that they figured out how to do,\n\n25:34.320 --> 25:36.960\nis they take your book bag and they empty it,\n\n25:36.960 --> 25:38.240\nand then they turn it inside out\n\n25:38.240 --> 25:39.920\nand put all your stuff back in,\n\n25:39.920 --> 25:41.680\nexcept I always had a lot of stuff,\n\n25:41.680 --> 25:44.400\nlike papers and whatever in my bag.\n\n25:44.400 --> 25:46.720\nSo the first time he tried it,\n\n25:46.720 --> 25:48.480\nhe just, he didn't bother putting it all

doing that,\n\n34:09.880 --> 34:11.880\nor a passion for sitting in a lot of people's shit.\n\n34:11.880 --> 34:15.880\nWell, I, yeah, I guess maybe the, the random oddball,\n\n34:15.880 --> 34:17.880\nit'd be like, for me,\n\n34:17.880 --> 34:20.880\nI'm probably gonna do a lot wrong.\n\n34:20.880 --> 34:26.880\nLike, I know, I know you, Turdy McGee.\n\n34:26.880 --> 34:28.880\nLike, there's only so many of those.\n\n34:28.880 --> 34:29.880\nAll right.\n\n34:29.880 --> 34:31.880\nLike, I'm from the hustler party.\n\n34:31.880 --> 34:34.880\nI love, I love swimming in poop.\n\n34:34.880 --> 34:36.880\nBut other than that, you'd be like,\n\n34:36.880 --> 34:38.880\nyou know, you'd have, like, civil servant types going,\n\n34:38.880 --> 34:39.880\nlike, look, I get it.\n\n34:39.880 --> 34:40.880\nYou're gonna poop on me.\n\n34:40.880 --> 34:41.880\nYou're gonna poop in my pants.\n\n34:41.880 --> 34:42.880\nIt's gonna get, every day,\n\n34:42.880 --> 34:44.880\nthey're gonna have to deal with this poop everywhere.\n\n34:44.880 --> 34:46.880\nAnd I'm gonna be surrounded by people\n\n34:46.880 --> 34:48.880\nwho have to deal with the stench of poop.\n\n34:48.880 --> 34:50.880\nLike, when they come in, it's not a glamorous job.\n\n34:50.880 --> 34:52.880\nIf you want power, and you want romance,\n\n34:52.880 --> 34:55.880\nyou don't get into politics that way.\n\n34:55.880 --> 34:57.880\nThat, that you keep all of those people,\n\n34:57.880 --> 35:00.880\nall those shitty people out of the business,\n\n35:00.880 --> 35:02.880\nby making it an actual shitty business.\n\n35:02.880 --> 35:03.880\nAll of those people, then,\n\n35:03.880 --> 35:05.880\nthey go into, like, model railroads or something.\n\n35:05.880 --> 35:07.880\nAll of a sudden, it just deflects into, like,\n\n35:07.880 --> 35:10.880\nmodel railroads become, like, a billion-dollar industry.\n\n35:10.880 --> 35:12.880\nIf you can make a perfect little train,\n\n35:12.880 --> 35:15.880\nlike, let that, let all the hobby shops be powerful.\n\n35:15.880 --> 35:17.880\nAnd, like, let there be lines outside of it,\n\n35:17.880 --> 35:18.880\nand people are just, like, swaggering,\n\n35:18.880 --> 35:19.880\nlike, oh, you wanna get in this hobby shop,\n\n35:19.880 --> 35:20.880\nand no one can figure it out.\n\n35:20.880 --> 35:23.880\nLike, like, like, like, let it be pointlessly pointful,\n\n35:23.880 --> 35:25.880\nyou know, like, like, outside of it, like, fuck that.\n\n35:25.880 --> 35:27.880\nAnd then the actual places where you're running the government\n\n35:27.880 --> 35:29.880\nare, like, like, people are just trying\n\n35:29.880 --> 35:31.880\nto keep the level of shit down\n\n35:31.880 --> 35:34.880\nby not fucking up everything all the time.\n\n35:34.880 --> 35:36.880\nIt's just a working theory, Jeff.\n\n35:36.880 --> 35:40.880\nIt hinges on this weird spiritual teleportation of shit thing,\n\n35:40.880 --> 35:42.880\nand also, like, an afterlife and kind of thing.\n\n35:42.880 --> 35:45.880\nBut there might be a way to, like, replicate the effect\n\n35:45.880 --> 35:47.880\nwith, like, holograms, or...\n\n35:47.880 --> 35:49.880\nIt's just something to keep in mind\n\n35:49.880 --> 35:51.880\nwhen we start our moon base on the moon.\n\n35:51.880 --> 35:52.880\nBring it back to the...\n\n35:52.880 --> 35:54.880\nTo our lost thesis.\n\n35:54.880 --> 35:55.880\nYeah.\n\n35:55.880 --> 35:57.880\nI don't know how you got me on that topic,\n\n35:57.880 --> 35:58.880\nbut that was Ryan Really's date.\n\n35:58.880 --> 36:00.880\nWe got three things left, okay?\n\n36:00.880 --> 36:01.880\nAll right.\n\n36:01.880 --> 36:02.880\nNo, two things.\n\n36:02.880 --> 36:05.880\nI jerked off today at work.\n\n36:05.880 --> 36:07.880\nWait.\n\n36:07.880 --> 36:10.880\nYour office is nothing but glass.\n\n36:10.880 --> 36:11.880\nIt's all windows.\n\n36:11.880 --> 36:13.880\nYeah, it's a secret bathroom.\n\n36:13.880 --> 36:15.880\nI had to...\n\n36:15.880 --> 36:17.880\nI'm telling you and Aaron at the same time,\n\n36:17.880 --> 36:18.880\nbecause I...\n\n36:18.880 --> 36:21.880\nBut I have to stay on the same page\n\n36:21.880 --> 36:22.880\nand stay transparent about it,\n\n36:22.880 --> 36:24.880\nbecause I had, like, three weeks ago,\n\n36:24.880 --> 36:27.880\nif you recall, I stopped\n\n36:27.880 --> 36:29.880\nbecause it was getting in the way of my work.\n\n36:29.880 --> 36:31.880\nThis was your first masturbation after the...\n\n36:31.880 --> 36:32.880\nYeah, yeah.\n\n36:32.880 --> 36:33.880\nI had...\n\n36:33.880 --> 36:35.880\nHere's the thing, like, last couple days,\n\n36:35.880 --> 36:36.880\nlike, I...\n\n36:36.880 --> 36:37.880\nYou didn't masturbate for three weeks?\n\n36:37.880 --> 36:38.880\nYeah.\n\n36:38.880 --> 36:39.880\nOh, that's wrong.\n\n36:39.880 --> 36:40.880\nHang on.\n\n36:40.880 --> 36:41.880\nYou're welcome.\n\n36:41.880 --> 36:42.880\nThank you, everybody.\n\n36:42.880 --> 36:43.880\nThank you.\n\n36:43.880 --> 36:44.880\nAnd you're welcome.\n\n36:44.880 --> 36:45.880\nSo that must have been a doozy.\n\n36:45.880 --> 36:46.880\nI did it.\n\n36:46.880 --> 36:47.880\nNot really, no?\n\n36:47.880 --> 36:48.880\nThat's the weird thing.\n\n36:48.880 --> 36:49.880\nIt wasn't like,\n\n36:49.880 --> 36:50.880\nOh, Hoover Dam!\n\n36:50.880 --> 36:52.880\nIt wasn't...\n\n36:52.880 --> 36:53.880\nIt was kind of like what...\n\n36:53.880 --> 36:54.880\nIt was like sneezing or something.\n\n36:54.880 --> 36:55.880\nIt was like,\n\n36:55.880 --> 36:56.880\nAll right.\n\n36:56.880 --> 36:57.880\nAnd that's why I had to do it,\n\n36:57.880 --> 36:58.880\nbecause I felt like...\n\n36:58.880 --> 37:00.880\nI kind of felt like a weird...\n\n37:00.880 --> 37:01.880\nIt wasn't like...\n\n37:01.880 --> 37:02.880\nLike, you know,\n\n37:02.880 --> 37:03.880\nyou're doing it eight times a day.\n\n37:03.880 --> 37:04.880\nIt's like a weird compulsive thing.\n\n37:04.880 --> 37:06.880\nLike, you're addicted to the dopamine in your brain\n\n37:06.880 --> 37:07.880\nthat's generated by,\n\n37:07.880 --> 37:08.880\nOh, this is my comfort.\n\n37:08.880 --> 37:09.880\nThis is like eating macaroni and cheese.\n\n37:09.880 --> 37:11.880\nIt's a different thing\n\n37:11.880 --> 37:13.880\nthan when you're like...\n\n37:13.880 --> 37:14.880\nLike, finally you're like,\n\n37:14.880 --> 37:18.880\nI feel like I have a bag of concrete in my pants.\n\n37:18.880 --> 37:19.880\nAnd I just...\n\n37:19.880 --> 37:21.880\nJust go into the bathroom.\n\n37:21.880 --> 37:22.880\nYou know?\n\n37:22.880 --> 37:23.880\nI don't know.\n\n37:23.880 --> 37:25.880\nI'm learning the same time as you are.\n\n37:25.880 --> 37:28.880\nYou made that a lot less sexy than it could have been.\n\n37:28.880 --> 37:30.880\nIt's not...\n\n37:30.880 --> 37:32.880\nIt's not a sexy thing.\n\n37:32.880 --> 37:35.880\nBut I'm confessing I ended my three-week streak.\n\n37:35.880 --> 37:37.880\nBut it was a biological imperative.\n\n37:37.880 --> 37:40.880\nI felt like I was going to get prostate cancer.\n\n37:40.880 --> 37:42.880\nBecause I hadn't...\n\n37:42.880 --> 37:44.880\nYou know, Aaron had been kind of sidelined\n\n37:44.880 --> 37:45.880\nfor the last three days,\n\n37:45.880 --> 37:47.880\nbecause I'm working really hard to finish the script.\n\n37:47.880 --> 37:48.880\nAnd so I was like,\n\n37:48.880 --> 37:49.880\nI'm staying up all night,\n\n37:49.880 --> 37:50.880\nand then I'm going to bed.\n\n37:50.880 --> 37:51.880\nI'm exhausted.\n\n37:51.880 --> 37:54.880\nSo the end result of that was like three days of...\n\n37:54.880 --> 37:56.880\nI'm not doing anything.\n\n37:56.880 --> 37:57.880\nAnd then I'm sitting at the office today.\n\n37:57.880 --> 38:00.880\nI'm like, I think I'm going to get cancer from...\n\n38:00.880 --> 38:01.880\nWhich is an urban legend,\n\n38:01.880 --> 38:03.880\nbut also I couldn't stop thinking about it.\n\n38:03.880 --> 38:04.880\nAnd I was like, I feel...\n\n38:04.880 --> 38:06.880\nI'm in pain.\n\n38:06.880 --> 38:08.880\nI'm just going to go and...\n\n38:08.880 --> 38:10.880\nYou might have saved your own life.\n\n38:10.880 --> 38:11.880\nYeah.\n\n38:11.880 --> 38:12.880\nSo I did it,\n\n38:12.880 --> 38:13.880\nand I apologize, America,\n\n38:13.880 --> 38:15.880\nbut I'm right back on the wagon.\n\n38:15.880 --> 38:16.880\nThat's like...\n\n38:16.880 --> 38:17.880\nI'm sorry.\n\n38:17.880 --> 38:18.880\nThat's your update.\n\n38:18.880 --> 38:19.880\nAll right.\n\n38:19.880 --> 38:20.880\nLast thing on the list.\n\n38:20.880 --> 38:21.880\nLast thing.\n\n38:21.880 --> 38:22.880\nReal Abbot's here again.\n\n38:22.880 --> 38:23.880\nOh, yeah.\n\n38:23.880 --> 38:28.880\nThis is a smattering of applause.\n\n38:28.880 --> 38:32.880\nBut an enthusiastic small portion of our crowd.\n\n38:32.880 --> 38:34.880\nSeven people really were into that.\n\n38:34.880 --> 38:36.880\nI saw him in the green room.\n\n38:38.880 --> 38:39.880\nI saw him in the green room,\n\n38:39.880 --> 38:42.880\nand he had a little brown paper bag,\n\n38:42.880 --> 38:46.880\nwhich I wanted to start a new segment called,\n\n38:46.880 --> 38:48.880\nWhat Did Abbot Buy at the Comic Book Store?\n\n38:48.880 --> 38:49.880\nAll right.\n\n38:49.880 --> 38:51.880\nSo let's bring up Real Abbot.\n\n38:51.880 --> 38:53.880\nAbbot Gaith.\n\n38:57.880 --> 38:58.880\nAbbot Gaith, everyone.\n\n38:58.880 --> 38:59.880\nHello.\n\n38:59.880 --> 39:00.880\nHow are you, man?\n\n39:00.880 --> 39:01.880\nGood to see you.\n\n39:01.880 --> 39:03.880\nHey, man.\n\n39:03.880 --> 39:06.880\nNo, first of all, last week was super fun.\n\n39:06.880 --> 39:07.880\nIt was like really fun.\n\n39:07.880 --> 39:10.880\nWhen's the last time you jerked off, Abbot?\n\n39:10.880 --> 39:12.880\nLike two days ago, maybe.\n\n39:12.880 --> 39:14.880\nSee, I can't jerk off either, actually,\n\n39:14.880 --> 39:16.880\nbecause I live with my brother now,\n\n39:16.880 --> 39:19.880\nand if I jerked off in the same house as him,\n\n39:19.880 --> 39:20.880\nright, it's weird.\n\n39:20.880 --> 39:21.880\nIt's a sin, right?\n\n39:21.880 --> 39:22.880\nWell, it's just weird.\n\n39:22.880 --> 39:24.880\nIt's kind of like, you need to be alone.\n\n39:24.880 --> 39:25.880\nWhat if you jerk off,\n\n39:25.880 --> 39:26.880\nand there's a room full of animators\n\n39:26.880 --> 39:27.880\noutside the bathroom door?\n\n39:27.880 --> 39:28.880\nThat's even worse.\n\n39:28.880 --> 39:29.880\nOh, OK.\n\n39:29.880 --> 39:30.880\nThat's worse.\n\n39:30.880 --> 39:33.880\nAlthough I have jerked off at work before in the past,\n\n39:33.880 --> 39:35.880\nand it's only because at the time,\n\n39:35.880 --> 39:36.880\nI can't remember, like you said,\n\n39:36.880 --> 39:37.880\nlike you felt you had cancer.\n\n39:37.880 --> 39:38.880\nI was like, something's wrong with me.\n\n39:38.880 --> 39:39.880\nI got it, yeah.\n\n39:39.880 --> 39:41.880\nAnd it's not even that joyful.\n\n39:41.880 --> 39:42.880\nIt's kind of like,\n\n39:42.880 --> 39:43.880\nYeah, it's like you have to do it.\n\n39:43.880 --> 39:44.880\nIf I had waited one more day,\n\n39:44.880 --> 39:46.880\nI might have had one of those legendary wet dreams\n\n39:46.880 --> 39:49.880\nthey taught us about in our 1950s-inspired\n\n39:49.880 --> 39:51.880\n1980s sex ed classes.\n\n39:51.880 --> 39:52.880\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n39:52.880 --> 39:53.880\nI had to tell you about wet dreams,\n\n39:53.880 --> 39:56.880\nand everyone in the 80s would be like,\n\n39:56.880 --> 39:57.880\nWet dreams?\n\n39:57.880 --> 39:58.880\nWell, how does that happen?\n\n39:58.880 --> 40:00.880\nBut it was like, they only knew wet dreams existed\n\n40:00.880 --> 40:01.880\nbecause in the 50s,\n\n40:01.880 --> 40:03.880\npeople actually didn't jerk off for a while.\n\n40:03.880 --> 40:05.880\nI thought wet dreams was like,\n\n40:05.880 --> 40:06.880\nwhen you just piss your pants.\n\n40:06.880 --> 40:07.880\nNo.\n\n40:07.880 --> 40:08.880\nThat's what I thought as a kid.\n\n40:08.880 --> 40:12.880\nAnd then later found out it was like the other thing, yeah.\n\n40:12.880 --> 40:13.880\nAnd I was really disturbed.\n\n40:13.880 --> 40:14.880\nI was like, whoa.\n\n40:14.880 --> 40:15.880\nI've never had a wet dream.\n\n40:15.880 --> 40:17.880\nI don't think I ever, either.\n\n40:17.880 --> 40:19.880\nI've had very, very...\n\n40:19.880 --> 40:21.880\nIs this like an accidental jerk off?\n\n40:21.880 --> 40:22.880\nIs that what happens?\n\n40:22.880 --> 40:23.880\nYeah, it's a nocturnal emission.\n\n40:23.880 --> 40:25.880\nIt's like you just come in your dream.\n\n40:25.880 --> 40:26.880\nWell, do you like rub against something,\n\n40:26.880 --> 40:27.880\nor is it just like...\n\n40:27.880 --> 40:28.880\nI think you probably...\n\n40:28.880 --> 40:29.880\nYour dream makes you go like,\n\n40:29.880 --> 40:30.880\noh!\n\n40:30.880 --> 40:31.880\nAnd then like you have a...\n\n40:31.880 --> 40:33.880\nYeah, theoretically, you would just...\n\n40:33.880 --> 40:34.880\nThis is doing shit to me.\n\n40:34.880 --> 40:36.880\nYou're dreaming about, you know,\n\n40:36.880 --> 40:38.880\nyou're hanging out and you're playing badminton\n\n40:38.880 --> 40:39.880\nwith Nicole Kidman in your dream,\n\n40:39.880 --> 40:40.880\nand then she, you know,\n\n40:40.880 --> 40:42.880\nand then something happens.\n\n40:42.880 --> 40:43.880\nAnd then, yeah.\n\n40:43.880 --> 40:44.880\nAnd in your dream,\n\n40:44.880 --> 40:46.880\nyour body doesn't move in your dream.\n\n40:46.880 --> 40:48.880\nOtherwise, that would be sleepwalking or whatever.\n\n40:48.880 --> 40:49.880\nSo you're just sitting there,\n\n40:49.880 --> 40:51.880\nbut then, ostensibly, I don't...\n\n40:51.880 --> 40:53.880\nI believe the scientists,\n\n40:53.880 --> 40:54.880\nif they say this happens,\n\n40:54.880 --> 40:56.880\nthat you're dreaming in your dream,\n\n40:56.880 --> 40:57.880\nyou're like, hey, Nicole Kidman,\n\n40:57.880 --> 40:58.880\ncome over for some lemonade.\n\n40:58.880 --> 41:00.880\nAnd she's like, hey, I love lemonade.\n\n41:00.880 --> 41:01.880\nI'm really grateful for it.\n\n41:01.880 --> 41:02.880\nAnd you're like,\n\n41:02.880 --> 41:03.880\nit's the best I can make.\n\n41:03.880 --> 41:04.880\nI mean, it's fresh lemons.\n\n41:04.880 --> 41:06.880\nAnd she's like, look,\n\n41:06.880 --> 41:07.880\nI feel like I owe you.\n\n41:07.880 --> 41:08.880\nI don't have any money.\n\n41:08.880 --> 41:09.880\nAnd you're like, look,\n\n41:09.880 --> 41:10.880\nyou don't owe me anything.\n\n41:10.880 --> 41:11.880\nYou're a guest at my house.\n\n41:11.880 --> 41:12.880\nIt's a badminton tournament.\n\n41:12.880 --> 41:13.880\nAnd then she's like...\n\n41:13.880 --> 41:15.880\nAnd then she does something.\n\n41:15.880 --> 41:16.880\nAnd you know, like, you wake up\n\n41:16.880 --> 41:17.880\nand you know...\n\n41:17.880 --> 41:18.880\nIt's never happened to me.\n\n41:18.880 --> 41:19.880\nLike, you know...\n\n41:19.880 --> 41:20.880\nYeah, it's never happened to me either.\n\n41:20.880 --> 41:21.880\nYou actually accumulate in your sleep.\n\n41:21.880 --> 41:23.880\nI can't believe with an imagination like that,\n\n41:23.880 --> 41:24.880\nthat you couldn't...\n\n41:24.880 --> 41:25.880\nYou stopped masturbating for three weeks.\n\n41:25.880 --> 41:26.880\nThat's how...\n\n41:26.880 --> 41:27.880\nWell, you have...\n\n41:27.880 --> 41:29.880\nThis is some heavy shit, man.\n\n41:29.880 --> 41:30.880\nWhy did you stop, actually?\n\n41:30.880 --> 41:31.880\nWhat was the reason?\n\n41:31.880 --> 41:32.880\nBecause I was trying to...\n\n41:32.880 --> 41:34.880\nI looked at the fact,\n\n41:34.880 --> 41:35.880\nand I was like,\n\n41:35.880 --> 41:39.880\nI am doing two things less than...\n\n41:39.880 --> 41:40.880\nLike, I am writing...\n\n41:40.880 --> 41:42.880\nLike, I'm not getting enough writing done.\n\n41:42.880 --> 41:44.880\nAnd I talked to Duncan Trussell,\n\n41:44.880 --> 41:45.880\nand he was like,\n\n41:45.880 --> 41:46.880\nyeah, it's like,\n\n41:46.880 --> 41:47.880\nis there something tied to this?\n\n41:47.880 --> 41:48.880\nYou know, it's not about self-denial.\n\n41:48.880 --> 41:49.880\nIt's about like,\n\n41:49.880 --> 41:51.880\nwhat are we really doing when we do this?\n\n41:51.880 --> 41:52.880\nAnd I noticed, like,\n\n41:52.880 --> 41:53.880\nwhen I have a deadline\n\n41:53.880 --> 41:55.880\nwhen I'm supposed to be writing,\n\n41:55.880 --> 41:57.880\nI break world records.\n\n41:57.880 --> 41:58.880\nIt's not even...\n\n41:58.880 --> 42:00.880\nThere's nothing happening down there.\n\n42:00.880 --> 42:04.880\nBut I'm compulsively doing this thing\n\n42:04.880 --> 42:06.880\nbecause I'm trying not to write,\n\n42:06.880 --> 42:07.880\nbecause I'll do anything other than write.\n\n42:07.880 --> 42:08.880\nRight, yeah.\n\n42:08.880 --> 42:09.880\nSo then you have a million other things,\n\n42:09.880 --> 42:10.880\nlike you check your Twitter\n\n42:10.880 --> 42:11.880\nand you do blah, blah, blah.\n\n42:11.880 --> 42:13.880\nBut one of the biggest things\n\n42:13.880 --> 42:14.880\nis that I really put a dent in everything.\n\n42:14.880 --> 42:15.880\nI just...\n\n42:15.880 --> 42:16.880\nIt's like, if you eliminate this artificially,\n\n42:16.880 --> 42:17.880\nthen like,\n\n42:17.880 --> 42:19.880\nif we close that door to that wing of the house,\n\n42:19.880 --> 42:21.880\nlet's see what happens in the other wings.\n\n42:21.880 --> 42:22.880\nI see.\n\n42:22.880 --> 42:23.880\nWell, you know, the thing that's weird for me\n\n42:23.880 --> 42:24.880\nwhen you say that is like,\n\n42:24.880 --> 42:26.880\nit never got in my way, really.\n\n42:26.880 --> 42:27.880\nIt just...\n\n42:27.880 --> 42:28.880\nSee?\n\n42:28.880 --> 42:29.880\nIf it was more mechanical,\n\n42:29.880 --> 42:30.880\nit was like, okay,\n\n42:30.880 --> 42:31.880\nI gotta go do this,\n\n42:31.880 --> 42:32.880\nand then I'll get back to what I was doing.\n\n42:32.880 --> 42:33.880\nWell, congratulations.\n\n42:33.880 --> 42:34.880\nYeah.\n\n42:34.880 --> 42:35.880\nBut I mean, that comes from like,\n\n42:35.880 --> 42:36.880\nyears of being single.\n\n42:36.880 --> 42:37.880\nYeah.\n\n42:37.880 --> 42:38.880\nAnd it just became normal to me.\n\n42:38.880 --> 42:39.880\nBut anyway,\n\n42:39.880 --> 42:40.880\nI still think it's normal.\n\n42:40.880 --> 42:41.880\nHumblebrag, I guess.\n\n42:41.880 --> 42:42.880\nI don't know.\n\n42:42.880 --> 42:45.880\nI mean, I feel like...\n\n42:45.880 --> 42:46.880\nSomething to do with writing,\n\n42:46.880 --> 42:49.880\nlike, I could fill a Dixie cup.\n\n42:49.880 --> 42:51.880\nLike, if someone told me,\n\n42:51.880 --> 42:54.880\nyou have to turn in a movie by next Wednesday,\n\n42:54.880 --> 42:55.880\nI would like...\n\n42:55.880 --> 42:56.880\nIf I don't...\n\n42:56.880 --> 42:57.880\nIf I don't...\n\n42:57.880 --> 42:58.880\nSo I was like...\n\n42:58.880 --> 42:59.880\nThat's quite...\n\n42:59.880 --> 43:00.880\nIt's just a murmur of dissatisfaction\n\n43:00.880 --> 43:01.880\ngoing through the crowd.\n\n43:01.880 --> 43:02.880\nThey don't...\n\n43:02.880 --> 43:03.880\nYeah, people don't really...\n\n43:03.880 --> 43:04.880\nThey don't like the visual,\n\n43:04.880 --> 43:05.880\nbut guess what?\n\n43:05.880 --> 43:07.880\nI'm not asking this to be gross,\n\n43:07.880 --> 43:09.880\nbut it's only a question.\n\n43:09.880 --> 43:10.880\nAre there women out there\n\n43:10.880 --> 43:11.880\nthat do that too as compulsively as guys?\n\n43:11.880 --> 43:12.880\nThey just...\n\n43:12.880 --> 43:13.880\nYou have a task...\n\n43:13.880 --> 43:14.880\nThey're not going to apply.\n\n43:14.880 --> 43:15.880\nGood question.\n\n43:15.880 --> 43:16.880\nI don't know.\n\n43:16.880 --> 43:17.880\nNobody?\n\n43:17.880 --> 43:18.880\nErin McGathy's one.\n\n43:18.880 --> 43:19.880\nYou?\n\n43:19.880 --> 43:20.880\nYeah?\n\n43:20.880 --> 43:21.880\nYou masturbate quite a bit\n\n43:21.880 --> 43:22.880\nwhen you got...\n\n43:22.880 --> 43:23.880\nDo you procrastinate and masturbate?\n\n43:23.880 --> 43:24.880\nNo.\n\n43:24.880 --> 43:25.880\nProcrasturbate,\n\n43:25.880 --> 43:27.880\nI think they call it.\n\n43:27.880 --> 43:28.880\nTitle of the episode.\n\n43:28.880 --> 43:29.880\nI don't know.\n\n43:29.880 --> 43:30.880\nIt's a correlation.\n\n43:30.880 --> 43:31.880\nNo?\n\n43:31.880 --> 43:32.880\nYou just masturbate all the time,\n\n43:32.880 --> 43:33.880\nanyway.\n\n43:33.880 --> 43:34.880\nYou know what?\n\n43:34.880 --> 43:35.880\nThere's playing video games.\n\n43:35.880 --> 43:36.880\nThere's eating ice cream.\n\n43:36.880 --> 43:37.880\nThere's masturbation.\n\n43:37.880 --> 43:39.880\nThere's checking your Twitter.\n\n43:39.880 --> 43:43.880\nSo all of those things are like leaves on a branch\n\n43:43.880 --> 43:44.880\nas part of a tree,\n\n43:44.880 --> 43:46.880\nand it all goes back to dopamine\n\n43:46.880 --> 43:47.880\nbeing generated in your brain.\n\n43:47.880 --> 43:48.880\nYeah, yeah.\n\n43:48.880 --> 43:49.880\nNo.\n\n43:49.880 --> 43:50.880\nYou're comforting yourself.\n\n43:50.880 --> 43:51.880\nYou go,\n\n43:51.880 --> 43:52.880\nI want to write,\n\n43:52.880 --> 43:54.880\nwriting is coming up against my limitations.\n\n43:54.880 --> 43:55.880\nI don't want to be doing that.\n\n43:55.880 --> 43:56.880\nWhat do I want to be doing?\n\n43:56.880 --> 43:58.880\nI feel like it clears the pipes, though,\n\n43:58.880 --> 43:59.880\nbecause it's like,\n\n43:59.880 --> 44:00.880\nyou got a lot of blockage,\n\n44:00.880 --> 44:01.880\nand you're like,\n\n44:01.880 --> 44:03.880\nfuck, I just want to watch something I'm watching,\n\n44:03.880 --> 44:05.880\nand I don't want to think about...\n\n44:05.880 --> 44:06.880\nAll right, well, Abbot,\n\n44:06.880 --> 44:07.880\nI've tried using your method\n\n44:07.880 --> 44:09.880\nof clearing the pipes constantly,\n\n44:09.880 --> 44:10.880\nand I got less writing done\n\n44:10.880 --> 44:11.880\nthan when I stopped drinking off.\n\n44:11.880 --> 44:12.880\nYou mean weed?\n\n44:12.880 --> 44:13.880\nNo.\n\n44:13.880 --> 44:14.880\nWhat?\n\n44:14.880 --> 44:15.880\nClearing the pipes.\n\n44:15.880 --> 44:16.880\nOh, sorry.\n\n44:16.880 --> 44:17.880\nI don't...\n\n44:17.880 --> 44:18.880\nDon't be sorry.\n\n44:18.880 --> 44:19.880\nJust make sense.\n\n44:19.880 --> 44:20.880\nNo, no.\n\n44:20.880 --> 44:22.880\nYou don't have to apologize.\n\n44:22.880 --> 44:23.880\nJust communicate.\n\n44:23.880 --> 44:25.880\nMy brain did one of those, like,\n\n44:25.880 --> 44:26.880\nrandom things.\n\n44:26.880 --> 44:27.880\nAll right.\n\n44:27.880 --> 44:28.880\nReal Abbot.\n\n44:28.880 --> 44:29.880\nWell, the...\n\n44:29.880 --> 44:31.880\nWhat's in the paper bag?\n\n44:31.880 --> 44:33.880\nWhat did you buy at the comic book store?\n\n44:33.880 --> 44:34.880\nI just, like...\n\n44:34.880 --> 44:35.880\nIt's awkward because it's like,\n\n44:35.880 --> 44:37.880\nwhoa, this isn't even something\n\n44:37.880 --> 44:38.880\nthat I've read or I know about.\n\n44:38.880 --> 44:39.880\nI just bought...\n\n44:39.880 --> 44:40.880\nI got, like...\n\n44:40.880 --> 44:42.880\nIt's Fashion Beast by Alan Moore.\n\n44:42.880 --> 44:43.880\nIssues two and three.\n\n44:43.880 --> 44:45.880\nI don't even know what it's about.\n\n44:45.880 --> 44:46.880\nFashion Beast?\n\n44:46.880 --> 44:47.880\nYeah, but it's like,\n\n44:47.880 --> 44:50.880\nI got it because I really like Alan Moore.\n\n44:50.880 --> 44:52.880\nAlan Moore's the next one.\n\n44:52.880 --> 44:53.880\nThat sounds appealing to me,\n\n44:53.880 --> 44:54.880\nbut...\n\n44:54.880 --> 44:55.880\nAlan Moore is the...\n\n44:55.880 --> 44:57.880\nHe's like the Dan Harmon of comics.\n\n44:57.880 --> 45:00.880\nWell, I just saw the first five minutes\n\n45:00.880 --> 45:02.880\nof a documentary about Alan Moore.\n\n45:02.880 --> 45:03.880\nI knew nothing about him.\n\n45:03.880 --> 45:05.880\nLike, you always hear his name.\n\n45:05.880 --> 45:07.880\nI'm really late to that party.\n\n45:07.880 --> 45:08.880\nOh, really?\n\n45:08.880 --> 45:09.880\nYeah, yeah.\n\n45:09.880 --> 45:10.880\nI knew nothing about him.\n\n45:10.880 --> 45:12.880\nBut amazing that he did all this shit\n\n45:12.880 --> 45:14.880\nthat everyone makes movies about all this shit.\n\n45:14.880 --> 45:15.880\nAnd he hates it.\n\n45:15.880 --> 45:16.880\nYeah, yeah.\n\n45:16.880 --> 45:17.880\nAnd he's like this amazing,\n\n45:17.880 --> 45:18.880\nlike, articulate, like,\n\n45:18.880 --> 45:19.880\ncrazy...\n\n45:19.880 --> 45:20.880\nHe's like you, kind of.\n\n45:20.880 --> 45:21.880\nBut, I mean,\n\n45:21.880 --> 45:22.880\nhe's like quite an individual,\n\n45:22.880 --> 45:23.880\ncrazy individual.\n\n45:23.880 --> 45:24.880\nYeah, he's...\n\n45:24.880 --> 45:26.880\nYeah, one should be envious of his,\n\n45:26.880 --> 45:28.880\nlike, he just planted a flag and goes,\n\n45:28.880 --> 45:29.880\nthis is who I am.\n\n45:29.880 --> 45:30.880\nHe's not...\n\n45:30.880 --> 45:31.880\nYeah.\n\n45:31.880 --> 45:32.880\nHe's putting out into the world.\n\n45:32.880 --> 45:33.880\nI am at 40.\n\n45:33.880 --> 45:34.880\nI don't know.\n\n45:34.880 --> 45:35.880\nLike, I'm still...\n\n45:35.880 --> 45:37.880\nI'll probably go to my grave in this lifetime,\n\n45:37.880 --> 45:39.880\nstill needing things from other people.\n\n45:39.880 --> 45:41.880\nBut it's so refreshing to see somebody\n\n45:41.880 --> 45:42.880\nthat's like,\n\n45:42.880 --> 45:45.880\nlike, he's just like pushing shit out\n\n45:45.880 --> 45:46.880\nand going like,\n\n45:46.880 --> 45:47.880\nthis is how I feel.\n\n45:47.880 --> 45:48.880\nThis is how I think.\n\n45:48.880 --> 45:49.880\nAnd it's like a man.\n\n45:49.880 --> 45:50.880\nYou can do like,\n\n45:50.880 --> 45:51.880\ngo and dip a cup into his river\n\n45:51.880 --> 45:52.880\nand drink it.\n\n45:52.880 --> 45:54.880\nHe's pretty interesting.\n\n45:54.880 --> 45:55.880\nMalcolm McLaren on that?\n\n45:55.880 --> 45:57.880\nLike, Malcolm McLaren?\n\n45:57.880 --> 45:59.880\nLike, Sex Pistols?\n\n45:59.880 --> 46:01.880\nLike, lipstick traces?\n\n46:01.880 --> 46:03.880\nNo, I mean, he's an artist, I guess.\n\n46:03.880 --> 46:04.880\nI don't know if the Sex Pistols guy...\n\n46:04.880 --> 46:06.880\nI'm thinking of a different name, probably.\n\n46:06.880 --> 46:07.880\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n46:07.880 --> 46:08.880\nI don't think it's the same guy.\n\n46:08.880 --> 46:09.880\nOh, is that the guy that was like the...\n\n46:09.880 --> 46:10.880\nIt was the asshole that kept...\n\n46:10.880 --> 46:11.880\nYeah.\n\n46:11.880 --> 46:12.880\nThat kept sitting on heroin.\n\n46:12.880 --> 46:13.880\nRight from the book, right?\n\n46:13.880 --> 46:14.880\nThat...\n\n46:14.880 --> 46:15.880\nThe Phil from the Fury and Johnny Rotten\n\n46:15.880 --> 46:16.880\nblames him for killing a...\n\n46:16.880 --> 46:17.880\nfor helping, you know,\n\n46:17.880 --> 46:18.880\nshit over this.\n\n46:18.880 --> 46:19.880\nRight, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n46:19.880 --> 46:20.880\nDifferent guy?\n\n46:20.880 --> 46:21.880\nI think it's the same name, yeah.\n\n46:21.880 --> 46:22.880\nDifferent guy?\n\n46:22.880 --> 46:23.880\nSame guy.\n\n46:23.880 --> 46:24.880\nHe's a cunt.\n\n46:24.880 --> 46:25.880\nSame guy, though?\n\n46:25.880 --> 46:26.880\nYeah, Malcolm McLaren's a cunt\n\n46:26.880 --> 46:27.880\nand I hope he comes on the show.\n\n46:27.880 --> 46:31.880\nSo the Sex Pistols guy drew this?\n\n46:31.880 --> 46:33.880\nWell, maybe he co-wrote it.\n\n46:33.880 --> 46:35.880\nAll right, Bruce Valance and Malcolm...\n\n46:35.880 --> 46:37.880\nJamal Warner, whatever.\n\n46:37.880 --> 46:38.880\nMalcolm McLaren.\n\n46:38.880 --> 46:39.880\nAll right, fun.\n\n46:39.880 --> 46:40.880\nHe must be Scottish.\n\n46:40.880 --> 46:41.880\nYou know what, though?\n\n46:41.880 --> 46:42.880\nAlan Moore...\n\n46:42.880 --> 46:44.880\nYou remember that time we saw Watchman?\n\n46:44.880 --> 46:45.880\nYeah.\n\n46:45.880 --> 46:47.880\nAnd I felt so bad because, like,\n\n46:47.880 --> 46:48.880\nI love the comic.\n\n46:48.880 --> 46:49.880\nI felt bad.\n\n46:49.880 --> 46:50.880\nYou know what I felt bad?\n\n46:50.880 --> 46:51.880\nWhat?\n\n46:51.880 --> 46:52.880\nI had just seen Watchman.\n\n46:52.880 --> 46:53.880\nYeah.\n\n46:53.880 --> 46:54.880\nThat's what was funny about it was, like,\n\n46:54.880 --> 46:56.880\nI love at the end of the movie just hearing your...\n\n46:56.880 --> 46:58.880\nYou go over about how bad it was.\n\n46:58.880 --> 46:59.880\nBecause I agreed.\n\n46:59.880 --> 47:00.880\nIt was, like, it was so bad.\n\n47:00.880 --> 47:02.880\nAnd I wanted to like it so much\n\n47:02.880 --> 47:03.880\nbecause I love the comic.\n\n47:03.880 --> 47:04.880\nBut it just didn't translate.\n\n47:04.880 --> 47:05.880\nYeah.\n\n47:05.880 --> 47:06.880\nAnd then you...\n\n47:06.880 --> 47:07.880\nYeah, it was just funny.\n\n47:07.880 --> 47:09.880\nIt was a movie that set out to ask\n\n47:09.880 --> 47:11.880\nand answer the question,\n\n47:11.880 --> 47:13.880\nwho watches the Watchman?\n\n47:13.880 --> 47:16.880\nIt's unfair, though,\n\n47:16.880 --> 47:18.880\nbecause the comic is, like...\n\n47:18.880 --> 47:19.880\nIt's really good.\n\n47:19.880 --> 47:20.880\nThat deserved more.\n\n47:20.880 --> 47:21.880\nI don't know.\n\n47:21.880 --> 47:22.880\nThat was a goodie.\n\n47:22.880 --> 47:23.880\nThat was a goodie.\n\n47:23.880 --> 47:25.880\nOh, well, you know, it kind of, like...\n\n47:25.880 --> 47:27.880\nI'm sure there were a lot of reviews\n\n47:27.880 --> 47:29.880\nthat capitalized on that Tia feeling.\n\n47:29.880 --> 47:30.880\nWell, some people like it,\n\n47:30.880 --> 47:31.880\nbut I was like you.\n\n47:31.880 --> 47:33.880\nI was like, I was so fucking bored.\n\n47:33.880 --> 47:34.880\nI was like, oh, God.\n\n47:34.880 --> 47:36.880\nI don't think, and I think Alan Moore\n\n47:36.880 --> 47:37.880\nwould probably agree,\n\n47:37.880 --> 47:39.880\nI don't think when you adapt a comic\n\n47:39.880 --> 47:41.880\ninto the television medium\n\n47:41.880 --> 47:42.880\nor the cinematic medium,\n\n47:42.880 --> 47:44.880\nI don't think your job\n\n47:44.880 --> 47:47.880\nis to take all of the content\n\n47:47.880 --> 47:48.880\nfrom the comic book,\n\n47:48.880 --> 47:50.880\nwhich is a specific medium,\n\n47:50.880 --> 47:52.880\nand translate it onto this\n\n47:52.880 --> 47:53.880\ntwo-dimensional stream.\n\n47:53.880 --> 47:54.880\nWhat was the 99 red balloons part?\n\n47:54.880 --> 47:55.880\nThat was so confusing.\n\n47:55.880 --> 47:57.880\nLike, why they played that song.\n\n47:57.880 --> 47:58.880\nI was confused.\n\n47:58.880 --> 47:59.880\nI really don't remember.\n\n47:59.880 --> 48:01.880\nI don't remember that song in the comic, you know?\n\n48:01.880 --> 48:03.880\nMaybe it was playing.\n\n48:03.880 --> 48:05.880\nI must have missed something there.\n\n48:05.880 --> 48:06.880\nThat was like one of those,\n\n48:06.880 --> 48:08.880\nlike that movie just full of moments like that,\n\n48:08.880 --> 48:09.880\nor the guy's ass.\n\n48:09.880 --> 48:11.880\nI think that the biggest problem with cinema today\n\n48:11.880 --> 48:14.880\nis that writing is increasingly a lost art,\n\n48:14.880 --> 48:17.880\nbecause it gets easier and easier to...\n\n48:17.880 --> 48:19.880\nWriting software is now just like,\n\n48:19.880 --> 48:22.880\nanyone, anyone, like a fire hydrant outside.\n\n48:22.880 --> 48:23.880\nRight.\n\n48:23.880 --> 48:27.880\nIs ten fingers away from writing a screenplay.\n\n48:27.880 --> 48:28.880\nIt used to be like,\n\n48:28.880 --> 48:29.880\noh, you have to know how to set the margins.\n\n48:29.880 --> 48:30.880\nAnd also, what if you...\n\n48:30.880 --> 48:32.880\nOh, there's a typo on one page,\n\n48:32.880 --> 48:33.880\nand you're going to get out white out\n\n48:33.880 --> 48:34.880\nor type the page over again.\n\n48:34.880 --> 48:36.880\nThere used to be a filter there\n\n48:36.880 --> 48:38.880\nthat guaranteed that people who were definitely\n\n48:38.880 --> 48:40.880\npassionate about getting that job done right\n\n48:40.880 --> 48:41.880\nwere the people that did that stuff.\n\n48:41.880 --> 48:43.880\nNow, fuck it.\n\n48:43.880 --> 48:44.880\nIt's as easy as, like, you know,\n\n48:44.880 --> 48:45.880\nTiddlywinks.\n\n48:45.880 --> 48:47.880\nAnd directing is not the case.\n\n48:47.880 --> 48:49.880\nSo you have these geniuses, these visionaries\n\n48:49.880 --> 48:51.880\nwho are so good at knowing where to put the camera\n\n48:51.880 --> 48:53.880\nand so passionate about the, you know,\n\n48:53.880 --> 48:55.880\nthe ways to use all this new technology,\n\n48:55.880 --> 48:58.880\nthe CG of those guys doing amazing things.\n\n48:58.880 --> 48:59.880\nIt's like, oh, this shot, like,\n\n48:59.880 --> 49:01.880\nI want to show that die-hard movie,\n\n49:01.880 --> 49:02.880\nthe Born Paternity, you know,\n\n49:02.880 --> 49:04.880\nwhere these are jumping out the...\n\n49:04.880 --> 49:06.880\nBorn Paternity.\n\n49:06.880 --> 49:07.880\nThe most amazing effects I've seen to date,\n\n49:07.880 --> 49:09.880\nbut it's this shitty die-hard sequel.\n\n49:09.880 --> 49:11.880\nIt's like, it's poorly written, you know.\n\n49:11.880 --> 49:13.880\nThe writing is not...\n\n49:13.880 --> 49:15.880\nBecause we've now regarded writing as like,\n\n49:15.880 --> 49:16.880\nah, fuck you.\n\n49:16.880 --> 49:17.880\nGive me the script. Hurry up.\n\n49:17.880 --> 49:18.880\nGive me the script.\n\n49:18.880 --> 49:19.880\nGive me the script, Fatty.\n\n49:19.880 --> 49:20.880\nThank you.\n\n49:20.880 --> 49:21.880\nHey, ten fatties. Ten fatties.\n\n49:21.880 --> 49:23.880\nGot any ten fatties?\n\n49:23.880 --> 49:25.880\nRewrite it. Rewrite it.\n\n49:25.880 --> 49:27.880\nJust keep rewriting it.\n\n49:27.880 --> 49:28.880\nKeep rewriting it.\n\n49:28.880 --> 49:29.880\nYou fucking fatty.\n\n49:29.880 --> 49:30.880\nYou neckbeards. You fucking...\n\n49:30.880 --> 49:32.880\nYou love Die Hard,\n\n49:32.880 --> 49:34.880\nand it's a good, for a good reason\n\n49:34.880 --> 49:36.880\nbecause that was based on a novel.\n\n49:36.880 --> 49:37.880\nNo, no, that's not why.\n\n49:37.880 --> 49:38.880\nIt's because the movie was good.\n\n49:38.880 --> 49:40.880\nI don't know, the novel can suck my dick.\n\n49:40.880 --> 49:42.880\nIt is a good movie, but I think because it was based on a novel.\n\n49:42.880 --> 49:44.880\nDie Hard 2 was based on a novel.\n\n49:44.880 --> 49:45.880\nDie Hard 3 was probably based on a novel.\n\n49:45.880 --> 49:47.880\nI don't think there's three Die Hard novels.\n\n49:47.880 --> 49:48.880\nThere's gotta be just one.\n\n49:48.880 --> 49:50.880\nNo, Abbot, there wasn't...\n\n49:50.880 --> 49:52.880\nThere was no Die Hard novel.\n\n49:52.880 --> 49:54.880\nThere was a Die Hard novel.\n\n49:54.880 --> 49:55.880\nI've seen the cover.\n\n49:55.880 --> 49:56.880\nAbbot, it wasn't called Die Hard.\n\n49:56.880 --> 49:58.880\nI know it was called Something the Building Blew Up.\n\n49:58.880 --> 49:59.880\nExactly.\n\n49:59.880 --> 50:00.880\nNo, no, something...\n\n50:00.880 --> 50:02.880\nAnd then there was another novel called\n\n50:02.880 --> 50:04.880\nSomething the Airport Blew Up.\n\n50:04.880 --> 50:05.880\nIt wasn't related.\n\n50:05.880 --> 50:08.880\nIt wasn't called Nakatomi 2, the airport this time.\n\n50:08.880 --> 50:09.880\nOh, I see, I see.\n\n50:09.880 --> 50:10.880\nIt's not...\n\n50:10.880 --> 50:12.880\nI'm saying, like, for the Die Hard movies,\n\n50:12.880 --> 50:13.880\nthey take novels and they go,\n\n50:13.880 --> 50:15.880\noh, then John McLean's in there too.\n\n50:15.880 --> 50:17.880\nI've never read any of these books.\n\n50:17.880 --> 50:19.880\nYou know Frank Sinatra was in there some movies.\n\n50:19.880 --> 50:21.880\nThe Die Hard franchise is...\n\n50:21.880 --> 50:22.880\nThe detective.\n\n50:22.880 --> 50:23.880\nWhat was that?\n\n50:23.880 --> 50:24.880\nThe detective.\n\n50:24.880 --> 50:25.880\nThe detective?\n\n50:25.880 --> 50:26.880\nOkay, there's a...\n\n50:26.880 --> 50:28.880\nI'm out of my depth here, but...\n\n50:28.880 --> 50:30.880\nThere's a novel that Die Hard's based on.\n\n50:30.880 --> 50:31.880\nThey at one time...\n\n50:31.880 --> 50:32.880\nDid they make it?\n\n50:32.880 --> 50:33.880\nDid they make the movie?\n\n50:33.880 --> 50:36.880\nYeah, it's in the same series of books.\n\n50:36.880 --> 50:38.880\nBut did they make a movie with Sinatra?\n\n50:38.880 --> 50:39.880\nYeah.\n\n50:39.880 --> 50:41.880\nOkay, so there's a Sinatra movie called...\n\n50:41.880 --> 50:42.880\nJohn McLean.\n\n50:42.880 --> 50:43.880\nThe detective.\n\n50:43.880 --> 50:46.880\nAnd which Sinatra is the John McLean character.\n\n50:46.880 --> 50:47.880\nI've never seen it.\n\n50:47.880 --> 50:48.880\nI did not know that.\n\n50:48.880 --> 50:49.880\nThat's crazy.\n\n50:49.880 --> 50:50.880\nI mean, is it any good?\n\n50:50.880 --> 50:51.880\nGood old Sinatra.\n\n50:51.880 --> 50:52.880\nI've never seen it.\n\n50:52.880 --> 50:53.880\nOh, wow.\n\n50:53.880 --> 50:54.880\nThat's cool.\n\n50:54.880 --> 50:55.880\nYeah, it's kind of interesting.\n\n50:55.880 --> 50:56.880\nHe was a good actor, right?\n\n50:56.880 --> 50:57.880\nLike my ensuring candidate?\n\n50:57.880 --> 50:58.880\nWasn't he good in that?\n\n50:58.880 --> 51:01.880\nHe was good for a guy who sang for a living for sure, yeah.\n\n51:01.880 --> 51:04.880\nYeah, I mean, yeah, it's not like that today, right?\n\n51:04.880 --> 51:05.880\nI don't know.\n\n51:05.880 --> 51:07.880\nHe won the Oscar from here to Eternity or something like that?\n\n51:07.880 --> 51:08.880\nYeah, yeah, I mean, he was sharp.\n\n51:08.880 --> 51:09.880\nHe was a good actor.\n\n51:09.880 --> 51:10.880\nYeah.\n\n51:10.880 --> 51:11.880\nAnyways, it doesn't matter.\n\n51:11.880 --> 51:14.880\nThe director, the writers of the...\n\n51:14.880 --> 51:16.880\nGood movies are often a fluke.\n\n51:16.880 --> 51:18.880\nLike Die Hard 1 was really good.\n\n51:18.880 --> 51:19.880\nYou can't repeat.\n\n51:19.880 --> 51:20.880\nEveryone tries to repeat.\n\n51:20.880 --> 51:23.880\nLike you get, let's get John McLean into direct another thing.\n\n51:23.880 --> 51:25.880\nIt's like, it's very, very difficult to...\n\n51:25.880 --> 51:26.880\nIt was like lightning in a bottle.\n\n51:26.880 --> 51:28.880\nIt's just sort of like an accident.\n\n51:28.880 --> 51:32.880\nYou can see from the movie, like they weren't trying to make an awesome classic action film\n\n51:32.880 --> 51:34.880\nthat was going to influence everything.\n\n51:34.880 --> 51:35.880\nYeah, same with Ghostbusters.\n\n51:35.880 --> 51:37.880\nThat second one is painful.\n\n51:37.880 --> 51:38.880\nYeah.\n\n51:38.880 --> 51:39.880\nRight?\n\n51:39.880 --> 51:40.880\nIt's so painful.\n\n51:40.880 --> 51:43.880\nBecause they're so close, but they're just so off the mark at every scene.\n\n51:43.880 --> 51:44.880\nYeah.\n\n51:44.880 --> 51:46.880\nI mean, when they get on the slime and they're fighting, it's ridiculous.\n\n51:46.880 --> 51:50.880\nAnd you get the DVDs and you can watch the deleted scenes on the first Ghostbusters movie,\n\n51:50.880 --> 51:51.880\nor Stripes or anything.\n\n51:51.880 --> 51:55.880\nAll these awesome, like Ivan Reitman movies, you get to the deleted scenes and then you\n\n51:55.880 --> 51:59.880\ngo, holy shit, if these eight scenes had been in the movie, this thing would have been a\n\n51:59.880 --> 52:01.880\nrandom mishmash.\n\n52:01.880 --> 52:05.880\nAnd the last thing we should take away from that is a little, like a nice humble one.\n\n52:05.880 --> 52:09.880\nIt's like the thing that we're trying to achieve is a spiritual event.\n\n52:09.880 --> 52:10.880\nIt's a collaboration.\n\n52:10.880 --> 52:12.880\nLike you're not, no one's a genius.\n\n52:12.880 --> 52:13.880\nYou're a Kowski Brothers.\n\n52:13.880 --> 52:14.880\nYou're not a genius.\n\n52:14.880 --> 52:20.880\nLike you sat down and you made a movie called The Matrix where you were so joyful.\n\n52:20.880 --> 52:22.880\nYou were like, I hope we make a good movie.\n\n52:22.880 --> 52:23.880\nOh, I love this movie.\n\n52:23.880 --> 52:24.880\nI love that movie.\n\n52:24.880 --> 52:25.880\nI love that movie.\n\n52:25.880 --> 52:27.880\nYou make The Matrix kind of on accident.\n\n52:27.880 --> 52:28.880\nYou make Jaws on accident.\n\n52:28.880 --> 52:29.880\nYou make Die Hard on accident.\n\n52:29.880 --> 52:31.880\nLike there's smart people.\n\n52:31.880 --> 52:32.880\nThere's dumb people.\n\n52:32.880 --> 52:33.880\nThere's talented people.\n\n52:33.880 --> 52:34.880\nThere's passionate people.\n\n52:34.880 --> 52:36.880\nBut when you make a good movie, you're fucking lucky.\n\n52:36.880 --> 52:40.880\nNo, and back to the future, because it's like, that movie's so perfect.\n\n52:40.880 --> 52:43.880\nYou watched them again recently, and the second one is just off.\n\n52:43.880 --> 52:46.880\nIt's like, ah, there's all these levels to it that aren't working.\n\n52:46.880 --> 52:47.880\nYeah, there's no way.\n\n52:47.880 --> 52:49.880\nEven the almighty Empire Strikes Back.\n\n52:49.880 --> 52:51.880\nEveryone goes, oh, I love it.\n\n52:51.880 --> 52:55.880\nNo, you remember being 11, and it gave you so much.\n\n52:55.880 --> 52:57.880\nIt gave you so much more action figure-wise.\n\n52:57.880 --> 53:01.880\nWait, are you saying that you don't like Empire?\n\n53:01.880 --> 53:06.880\nI'm just saying it's, I'm saying that unlike, I'm 40 years old.\n\n53:06.880 --> 53:07.880\nHe's so bored.\n\n53:07.880 --> 53:08.880\nI'm entitled to my opinion.\n\n53:08.880 --> 53:09.880\nYou look bored.\n\n53:09.880 --> 53:12.880\nI don't think it's the best movie of the Star Wars trilogy.\n\n53:12.880 --> 53:21.880\nI think that Star Wars is so good that Empire Strikes Back can sit on it as a patio and not break.\n\n53:21.880 --> 53:25.880\nBut see, you're looking at it as like the foundation is what makes the second one important, right?\n\n53:25.880 --> 53:26.880\nThat's where your angle is?\n\n53:26.880 --> 53:30.880\nI'm looking at timelessness and storytelling and clear, simple things.\n\n53:30.880 --> 53:33.880\nLike Star Wars could be a cowboy movie.\n\n53:33.880 --> 53:34.880\nYou could tell the same story.\n\n53:34.880 --> 53:36.880\nThe little farm boy from a small farm town.\n\n53:36.880 --> 53:38.880\nHe becomes a bigger part of a bigger world.\n\n53:38.880 --> 53:41.880\nEmpire Strikes Back is driven by sci-fi concepts.\n\n53:41.880 --> 53:45.880\nIf there's no big penis monster trying to swallow your spatial, there's no movie.\n\n53:45.880 --> 53:46.880\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n53:46.880 --> 53:51.880\nA plot point is we're inside a squishy thing and there's a million plot points in Empire Strikes Back\n\n53:51.880 --> 53:53.880\nthat are like, it has to be a sci-fi movie.\n\n53:53.880 --> 53:56.880\nSo it's just at the end of the day a good sci-fi movie Star Wars is a timeless masterpiece.\n\n53:56.880 --> 53:57.880\nLet's move on.\n\n53:57.880 --> 53:59.880\nOkay, well, all right, all right, yeah.\n\n53:59.880 --> 54:05.880\nI mean, after dinner, I want to say, I mean, after the show, I want to tell you why I think Empire is better.\n\n54:05.880 --> 54:06.880\nAfter dinner?\n\n54:06.880 --> 54:09.880\nDid you just ask Dan out on a date?\n\n54:09.880 --> 54:12.880\nYou caught me.\n\n54:12.880 --> 54:14.880\nNext week, we're going to hear about that date.\n\n54:14.880 --> 54:15.880\nSlick way.\n\n54:15.880 --> 54:19.880\nAnd then we're going to find out that he left like a sock at your place.\n\n54:19.880 --> 54:24.880\nIs it possible to have Abed play Chris de Burgh?\n\n54:24.880 --> 54:26.880\nI'm assuming Camille's not here.\n\n54:26.880 --> 54:27.880\nCamille, not Johnny.\n\n54:27.880 --> 54:31.880\nCan we get another mic for Aaron and bring, let's get Spencer up here.\n\n54:31.880 --> 54:34.880\nI'm kind of a D&D virgin.\n\n54:34.880 --> 54:35.880\nYou know what I mean?\n\n54:35.880 --> 54:36.880\nI'm a D&D virgin.\n\n54:36.880 --> 54:37.880\nI've never played before.\n\n54:37.880 --> 54:38.880\nThat's all right.\n\n54:38.880 --> 54:39.880\nIt's fine.\n\n54:39.880 --> 54:40.880\nI know.\n\n54:40.880 --> 54:41.880\nBut don't I have to know stuff?\n\n54:41.880 --> 54:42.880\nNo.\n\n54:42.880 --> 54:43.880\nNo.\n\n54:43.880 --> 54:46.880\nSpencer, everyone.\n\n54:46.880 --> 54:47.880\nAnd Erin McGathy.\n\n54:47.880 --> 54:52.880\nI think I just ran into these right now.\n\n54:52.880 --> 54:54.880\nPut them off to the side kind of.\n\n54:54.880 --> 54:55.880\nThey're in the way.\n\n54:55.880 --> 54:56.880\nJust put them there.\n\n54:56.880 --> 54:57.880\nThank you.\n\n54:57.880 --> 54:58.880\nHello, Spencer.\n\n54:58.880 --> 54:59.880\nHow are you doing today, man?\n\n54:59.880 --> 55:00.880\nI'm doing good.\n\n55:00.880 --> 55:01.880\nI just dropped a dice.\n\n55:01.880 --> 55:02.880\nI'm doing good.\n\n55:02.880 --> 55:03.880\nYou can sit down.\n\n55:03.880 --> 55:04.880\nI'll stand.\n\n55:04.880 --> 55:05.880\nYou dropped a dice?\n\n55:05.880 --> 55:06.880\nThat's fine.\n\n55:06.880 --> 55:07.880\nWhat did you roll?\n\n55:07.880 --> 55:08.880\nI can't see it.\n\n55:08.880 --> 55:10.880\nThat's a good sign, though.\n\n55:10.880 --> 55:12.880\nDice on the floor.\n\n55:12.880 --> 55:13.880\nAdventures galore.\n\n55:13.880 --> 55:17.880\nDice on the table.\n\n55:17.880 --> 55:21.880\nEvil is able to happen.\n\n55:21.880 --> 55:22.880\nTo happen.\n\n55:22.880 --> 55:24.880\nAre you awkward that I stand?\n\n55:24.880 --> 55:26.880\nOr, you know, should I sit down?\n\n55:26.880 --> 55:27.880\nI am awkward that I stand, yeah.\n\n55:27.880 --> 55:29.880\nBut I'll be so far down it'll be like weird.\n\n55:29.880 --> 55:30.880\nNo, you can stand.\n\n55:30.880 --> 55:31.880\nActually, you sit.\n\n55:31.880 --> 55:32.880\nI don't want to be a rude host.\n\n55:32.880 --> 55:33.880\nAre you sure?\n\n55:33.880 --> 55:34.880\nWell, now I feel bad.\n\n55:34.880 --> 55:38.880\nYou're a doctor host.\n\n55:38.880 --> 55:41.880\nWe're most comfortable when you feel bad.\n\n55:41.880 --> 55:42.880\nThat's true.\n\n55:42.880 --> 55:44.880\nYou're like Superman in the train tracks.\n\n55:44.880 --> 55:49.880\nYou'll be filling in for Camille's character, Chris de Burghh, who is a thief.\n\n55:49.880 --> 55:50.880\nI'm not mistaken, right, Spencer?\n\n55:50.880 --> 55:51.880\nThat's correct.\n\n55:51.880 --> 55:52.880\nA rogue.\n\n55:52.880 --> 55:53.880\nChris de Burghh, like Christ Berg?\n\n55:53.880 --> 55:54.880\nYes.\n\n55:54.880 --> 55:55.880\nYes.\n\n55:55.880 --> 55:56.880\nHe's a Jewish messiah.\n\n55:56.880 --> 55:59.880\nHe wrote Lady in Red, Chris de Burghh.\n\n55:59.880 --> 56:03.880\nYeah, he wrote the song, The Lady in Red, from the 80s.\n\n56:03.880 --> 56:04.880\nRight, right.\n\n56:04.880 --> 56:09.380\nAnd he's been on hard times, but now he's taken part in our adventure with us and our quest\n\n56:09.380 --> 56:10.880\ntowards wherever the hell we're going.\n\n56:10.880 --> 56:11.880\nI don't know, is it?\n\n56:11.880 --> 56:12.880\nWe got through all of my items.\n\n56:12.880 --> 56:16.880\nIs he like a new member of the correct quest, like he just joined?\n\n56:16.880 --> 56:17.880\nYeah.\n\n56:17.880 --> 56:18.880\nOkay.\n\n56:18.880 --> 56:19.880\nYeah.\n\n56:19.880 --> 56:20.880\nSorry.\n\n56:20.880 --> 56:23.880\nSpencer, are you ready to get us up to date?\n\n56:23.880 --> 56:24.880\nNot quite.\n\n56:24.880 --> 56:25.880\nI mean, what's up, you guys?\n\n56:25.880 --> 56:26.880\nNo, let's kill some time.\n\n56:26.880 --> 56:27.880\nOkay, cool.\n\n56:27.880 --> 56:30.880\nDan, I got to say great analogies tonight.\n\n56:30.880 --> 56:31.880\nOh, thank you.\n\n56:31.880 --> 56:32.880\nYou.\n\n56:32.880 --> 56:37.880\nIt always sounds sarcastic when I'm complimenting you, but it's really good.\n\n56:37.880 --> 56:40.880\nThe omelet line and the...\n\n56:40.880 --> 56:42.880\nWhat was the pepper of the...\n\n56:42.880 --> 56:44.880\nYeah, that either your omelet needs something.\n\n56:44.880 --> 56:45.880\nOh, thanks, baby.\n\n56:45.880 --> 56:46.880\nGreat guys.\n\n56:46.880 --> 56:50.880\nHow are you enjoying living with me?\n\n56:50.880 --> 56:51.880\nI'm loving it.\n\n56:51.880 --> 56:52.880\nYeah, we're making the space.\n\n56:52.880 --> 56:56.880\nI had planned to turn into a giant master bathroom into your little art studio.\n\n56:56.880 --> 56:57.880\nMm-hmm.\n\n56:57.880 --> 56:58.880\nYeah.\n\n56:58.880 --> 56:59.880\nI like that.\n\n56:59.880 --> 57:00.880\nIt's a nice testament to...\n\n57:00.880 --> 57:01.880\nIt's like, you know what?\n\n57:01.880 --> 57:04.880\nI'll keep using a slightly smaller bathroom.\n\n57:04.880 --> 57:09.880\nIt's like, you know, that's what, you know, relationships are.\n\n57:09.880 --> 57:12.880\nEvery time I walk in that room, I really feel your love.\n\n57:12.880 --> 57:16.880\nYou feel the ghost of my dreams of having like this Roman bath.\n\n57:16.880 --> 57:18.880\nGhost of your dreams.\n\n57:18.880 --> 57:19.880\nThis colligulant like...\n\n57:19.880 --> 57:25.880\nI was going to have people pour pictures of hot water over me.\n\n57:25.880 --> 57:27.880\nYeah, it's like, now it's where you make calendars.\n\n57:27.880 --> 57:31.880\nThat would be awesome to have a room in your house that's actually a big bath,\n\n57:31.880 --> 57:34.880\nbut there's always a bunch of old Roman senators in there.\n\n57:34.880 --> 57:36.880\nThey're always plotting against me.\n\n57:36.880 --> 57:40.880\nNo matter where I'm at.\n\n57:40.880 --> 57:41.880\nOh, whoa.\n\n57:41.880 --> 57:42.880\nDan, sorry.\n\n57:42.880 --> 57:43.880\nWe didn't know you were here.\n\n57:43.880 --> 57:46.880\nNo matter where I'm at in my life, they're always plotting against me.\n\n57:46.880 --> 57:48.880\nIt just makes me feel more important.\n\n57:48.880 --> 57:50.880\nI think I would like an egg salad sandwich.\n\n57:50.880 --> 57:51.880\nOh, of course.\n\n57:51.880 --> 57:54.880\nWhat are you whispering about?\n\n57:54.880 --> 57:55.880\nNothing, sir.\n\n57:55.880 --> 57:56.880\nNothing.\n\n57:56.880 --> 57:57.880\nEgg salad.\n\n57:57.880 --> 57:58.880\nThe perfect choice.\n\n57:58.880 --> 58:00.880\nBut just to come home from work and go into the...\n\n58:00.880 --> 58:02.880\nYeah, Aaron, I'm going to go on and take a steam and you're going in a...\n\n58:02.880 --> 58:03.880\nHello, Gragas.\n\n58:03.880 --> 58:04.880\nHello, Thrasius.\n\n58:04.880 --> 58:08.880\nBut then you also go to the drawing room and I go like,\n\n58:08.880 --> 58:10.880\nI think Gragas and Fraxie are...\n\n58:10.880 --> 58:14.880\nI don't think they wanted me to have an egg salad sandwich.\n\n58:14.880 --> 58:16.880\nI fear the game is afoot.\n\n58:16.880 --> 58:19.880\nAlso, I've never seen them outside of the steam room.\n\n58:19.880 --> 58:20.880\nYeah, no.\n\n58:20.880 --> 58:23.880\nI think I'm safe in that regard because they're pretty unmotivated.\n\n58:23.880 --> 58:25.880\nYeah, because I don't bathe often.\n\n58:25.880 --> 58:27.880\nSo it's a den of thieves in there.\n\n58:27.880 --> 58:29.880\nIt's a sewing circle.\n\n58:29.880 --> 58:31.880\nThat's the best.\n\n58:31.880 --> 58:34.880\nOne of them is always Malcolm McDowell.\n\n58:34.880 --> 58:36.880\nSure, sure.\n\n58:36.880 --> 58:38.880\nI love it.\n\n58:38.880 --> 58:42.880\nI think I have this sweater, but mine's blue.\n\n58:42.880 --> 58:43.880\nDid you get that at...\n\n58:43.880 --> 58:44.880\nFashion Beast.\n\n58:44.880 --> 58:47.880\nYeah, I'm the Fashion Beast.\n\n58:47.880 --> 58:48.880\nDid you get that at...\n\n58:48.880 --> 58:49.880\nI have that sweater.\n\n58:49.880 --> 58:50.880\nWhere did you get that?\n\n58:50.880 --> 58:52.880\nWe shop at the same store.\n\n58:52.880 --> 58:54.880\nI don't know.\n\n58:54.880 --> 58:56.880\n21 Forever?\n\n58:56.880 --> 58:57.880\nTarget.\n\n58:57.880 --> 58:59.880\nYeah, that's where I got mine.\n\n58:59.880 --> 59:01.880\nSee, I knew I was just pointing...\n\n59:01.880 --> 59:02.880\nPeople are going on Target.\n\n59:02.880 --> 59:04.880\nYou know this sweater from Target?\n\n59:04.880 --> 59:05.880\nSo you have...\n\n59:05.880 --> 59:08.880\nLady, take it easy.\n\n59:08.880 --> 59:09.880\nI'm kidding.\n\n59:09.880 --> 59:10.880\nJeremy, did you cut off the sleeves?\n\n59:10.880 --> 59:11.880\nI'm Paula from Scotland.\n\n59:11.880 --> 59:12.880\nPaula from Scotland?\n\n59:12.880 --> 59:13.880\nNo, I don't cut Paula.\n\n59:13.880 --> 59:16.880\nI'm a big Teenage Fan Club fan.\n\n59:16.880 --> 59:18.880\nThey're amazing.\n\n59:18.880 --> 59:21.880\nWay to connect those dots, man.\n\n59:21.880 --> 59:24.880\nGreat job on Teenage Fan Club, by the way.\n\n59:24.880 --> 59:26.880\nAnd Arab Strap, they're great.\n\n59:26.880 --> 59:29.880\nShe's so enough of you, Jeff, you have no idea.\n\n59:29.880 --> 59:32.880\nWhere are you from?\n\n59:32.880 --> 59:33.880\nWhat?\n\n59:33.880 --> 59:35.880\nLondon, wow.\n\n59:35.880 --> 59:37.880\nShe just said she's so in love with you, Jeff,\n\n59:37.880 --> 59:38.880\nyou have no idea.\n\n59:38.880 --> 59:39.880\nPodcast listeners.\n\n59:39.880 --> 59:40.880\nI like he was a friend.\n\n59:40.880 --> 59:45.880\nIt's a lot happening.\n\n59:45.880 --> 59:47.880\nThank you, Paula.\n\n59:47.880 --> 59:48.880\nBut you have to hear the accents, really.\n\n59:48.880 --> 59:49.880\nI hope the mic's picked up.\n\n59:49.880 --> 59:52.880\nIt's like a terrible sequel to Trainspotting or something.\n\n59:52.880 --> 59:54.880\nThey have a cool accent.\n\n59:54.880 --> 59:56.880\nIt works against them, because I'm sure they're already drunk,\n\n59:56.880 --> 59:58.880\nbut the Scottish accent, yeah.\n\n59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880\nWhat?\n\n01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.880\nThe Scottish accent makes you sound twice as drunk.\n\n01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:06.880\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.880\nIt's a great day for multi-colour racing.\n\n01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.880\nWow.\n\n01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.880\nOffensive and an old reference.\n\n01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.880\nI took a comedy sports accent workshop.\n\n01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.880\nGive me an accent.\n\n01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.880\nIrish.\n\n01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.880\nYou think you love me, but you don't.\n\n01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.880\nBoston.\n\n01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.880\nBoston.\n\n01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.880\nI'm wicked retarded.\n\n01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:42.880\nMadagascar.\n\n01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.880\nIt's not bad.\n\n01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.880\nThat was more Mozambique.\n\n01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.880\nCan you do Australian?\n\n01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.880\nYeah.\n\n01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.880\nBoomerang.\n\n01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.880\nForget it.\n\n01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.880\nI only knew the Irish and Scottish ones.\n\n01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.880\nThanks for hitting those first.\n\n01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.880\nWe should have stopped there.\n\n01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.880\nAll right.\n\n01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.880\nHow about Russian?\n\n01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.880\nYou got to have a Mozambique squirrel.\n\n01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.880\nYou are giving me microfiche.\n\n01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.880\nFrench.\n\n01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.880\nGerman.\n\n01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:21.880\nWe must get the cereal.\n\n01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.880\nGo on.\n\n01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.880\nThe cereal nut.\n\n01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:30.880\nFor cereal is important for multi-colour racing.\n\n01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.880\nMust a next multi-colour track.\n\n01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.880\nLet me see your papers.\n\n01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.880\nYour papers, sir.\n\n01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.880\nYour papers.\n\n01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.880\nMy papers are running.\n\n01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.880\nOpening smart car.\n\n01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.880\nMulti-car racing.\n\n01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.880\nMust ignore multi-car siren.\n\n01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.880\nRacing out of Berlin.\n\n01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.880\nDouble agent.\n\n01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:53.880\nAll points both of them.\n\n01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.880\nA man pretending to be Scottish\n\n01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.880\nis driving towards the German border.\n\n01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.880\nMeanwhile at the Reichstag.\n\n01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.880\nSigning these Hitler papers is so boring.\n\n01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.880\nWhere is my cereal?\n\n01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.880\nFather.\n\n01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.880\nWhy can't I find my cereal in Germany?\n\n01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.880\nFather.\n\n01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.880\nI'm Hitler.\n\n01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880\nRight.\n\n01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.880\nI'm Hitler.\n\n01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.880\nI'm your father.\n\n01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.880\nYou loved cereal.\n\n01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.880\nJust be careful, my son.\n\n01:02:24.880 -->

handsome.\n\n01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.880\nOh, I'm being shot.\n\n01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.880\nI'm Hitler.\n\n01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.880\nHitler only got away with what he did\n\n01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.880\nbecause the cops couldn't find him.\n\n01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.880\nThe whole time the German police are like,\n\n01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.880\nthat's not right.\n\n01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.880\nYou're under arrest, but we can't find him.\n\n01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.880\nHe's just like, smoking weed at your house.\n\n01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880\nHe's just killing 6 million people\n\n01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.880\nand I was looking for him.\n\n01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.880\nAll right, all right, that's enough.\n\n01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.880\nYou're coming downtown, Hitler.\n\n01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.880\nEven the German police are Irish.\n\n01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.880\nOh, what do we got here?\n\n01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.880\nOh, I don't know, Glancy.\n\n01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.880\nWe're shutting you down, Hitler.\n\n01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.880\nLooks like someone's committed a wee bit to genocide.\n\n01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.880\nOh, tell it to the judge.\n\n01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.880\nOh, no.\n\n01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.880\nHitler only got a few minutes.\n\n01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.880\nOh, yeah, I'll keep talking, sir.\n\n01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.880\nYou're coming downtown.\n\n01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.880\nI'm from the Gestapo.\n\n01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.880\nNo, they're not.\n\n01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.880\nThe Gestapo's his anyway.\n\n01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.880\nThey're a little better, please.\n\n01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.880\nThey got Billy Clebsack.\n\n01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.880\nI don't think so.\n\n01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.880\nAll right, Jesus, let's play some sad music.\n\n01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.880\nLet's bring this thing on.\n\n01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.880\nGet us up to date, would you?\n\n01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:46.880\nAll right, last time on Harmontown, our heroes.\n\n01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.880\nWhat?\n\n01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880\nNothing.\n\n01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.880\nThis is good.\n\n01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.880\nThey would have heard it on Harmontown.\n\n01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:52.880\nYeah.\n\n01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.880\nYeah, with the help of Chris de Burghh,\n\n01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.880\ntraverse the dark forests of Twyla.\n\n01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.880\nThe troop defeated a small horde of zombies\n\n01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.880\nbefore coming upon the ruins of Merchul.\n\n01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.880\nPassing strange statues,\n\n01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.880\nmoving away to a mysterious stand of trees\n\n01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.880\nentwined and entangled into a massive clump\n\n01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.880\nof trunks and brambles.\n\n01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.880\nThrowing caution to the wind,\n\n01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.880\nQuark jumped through a narrow crack in the trees,\n\n01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.880\nfalling into a muddy hole below.\n\n01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.880\nSoon after, the rest of the party followed,\n\n01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.880\nand together they found themselves stuck in the muck.\n\n01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.880\nAfter searching around in the darkness,\n\n01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880\nthey found an odd tile,\n\n01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.880\ndiscovering it to be made of thin wood\n\n01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880\nand kicked it to kindling.\n\n01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.880\nSharpie cast light on an arrow,\n\n01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.880\nwhich Chris de Burghh handily shot through the open,\n\n01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.880\nand crawled through into the narrow tunnel,\n\n01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.880\nexamining a large mosaic depicting a green dragon\n\n01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.880\non the floor.\n\n01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.880\nHe attempted to remove what appeared to be a massive treasure\n\n01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.880\nbefore he realized he'd sprung a Schrab.\n\n01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.880\nAh, I'm so sorry, this is awful.\n\n01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.880\nFuck everything.\n\n01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.880\nNo, it's great.\n\n01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.880\nI'm just gonna leave right now.\n\n01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:49.880\nWhat's going on? What do you mean?\n\n01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.880\nI'm not reading off of this.\n\n01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.880\nYou're not living up to the Harmontown mark of quality?\n\n01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.880\nYou set such a big standard, you know?\n\n01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.880\nYeah, it's been a tight show.\n\n01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.880\nIt's a hard act to follow.\n\n01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.880\nYeah. Seamless.\n\n01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.880\nA solid wall of thick stone thudded into the ground,\n\n01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.880\nblocking the exit, began rumbling toward the songmaster.\n\n01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.880\nWhat would he do? What would he do?\n\n01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.880\nStill, he gets the music just right.\n\n01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.880\nSpencer, I'm gonna call bullshit on that one.\n\n01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.880\nI think he fabricated it.\n\n01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.880\nI think you knew the music was longer than you needed,\n\n01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:28.880\nand you faked a moment of insecurity\n\n01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.880\njust so you could come back and just, like,\n\n01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.880\ncome right down on the end of the music.\n\n01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.880\nIt came from a real moment of insecurity,\n\n01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.880\nbut I realized I could twist it to my advantage.\n\n01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:39.880\nAll right.\n\n01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.880\nAll right, I examine our immediate surrounding, Spencer.\n\n01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.880\nOkay, so you guys were in this dark pit.\n\n01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.880\nThere was this hole.\n\n01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.880\nChristopher crawled through it,\n\n01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.880\nand he was looking at the floor,\n\n01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.880\nand then he was trying to extricate a large ruby,\n\n01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.880\nand that caused a trap to go off,\n\n01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.880\ncausing a wall to separate the two of you.\n\n01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.880\nThe wall started approaching,\n\n01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.880\nthreatening to crush him against the wall.\n\n01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.880\nI have evasion as a special ability.\n\n01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.880\nCan I evade?\n\n01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.880\nYou cannot evade getting crushed to death\n\n01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.880\nbetween two walls.\n\n01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:11.880\nOh, no.\n\n01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.880\nSo you were...\n\n01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880\nYou got a moment?\n\n01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.880\nWhen you were playing as Kumail,\n\n01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.880\nor when Kumail was playing as your character,\n\n01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.880\nwho you're playing as, whatever,\n\n01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.880\nhe was pulling the ruby out of the ground,\n\n01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.880\nand it was big.\n\n01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880\nIt was this big thing,\n\n01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.880\nand he was starting to get it,\n\n01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.880\nand it was starting to come out of the ground.\n\n01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.880\nBut, you know, he's trapped because, like,\n\n01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.880\nyou don't know if you want to pull it out of the ground.\n\n01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.880\nCan you put the ruby back in and stop the wall?\n\n01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.880\nYeah, I'm going to put the ruby back,\n\n01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.880\nbecause that seems like a no-no.\n\n01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.880\nDropping the ruby had falls into its place.\n\n01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.880\nThe wall continues to advance.\n\n01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.880\nOh, no.\n\n01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.880\nSo from our perspective,\n\n01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.880\nwe see a wall moving forward.\n\n01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.880\nSo, like I said, there's this hole.\n\n01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.880\nAt this point, you're probably peering through,\n\n01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.880\nbecause you're like, what the fuck, right?\n\n01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.880\nSo, Quark, he tried to jump through\n\n01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.880\nand save him, if I recall correctly,\n\n01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.880\nbut the wall thudded down before that.\n\n01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.880\nSo, he's probably in the best position\n\n01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.880\nto see what's going on.\n\n01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.880\nBut, yeah, basically you saw the wall come down,\n\n01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.880\nand it's going towards...\n\n01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.880\nSo, the wall's in between me and Christopher right now?\n\n01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.880\nYeah, and you can tell from what you've seen\n\n01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.880\nthat it's probably going to crush him.\n\n01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.880\nAnd the wall's moving away from Jeff.\n\n01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.880\nAway from you.\n\n01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.880\nIs there a way to get over the wall?\n\n01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.880\nIt goes from the ceiling all the way down.\n\n01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.880\nSo, there's no way to get around it or over or under it?\n\n01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.880\nNot as far as you can tell.\n\n01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.880\nDamn it.\n\n01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.880\nI look around on the floor\n\n01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.880\nfor any kind of triggers or traps\n\n01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.880\nto sense some way to stop this.\n\n01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.880\nAll right.\n\n01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.880\nNope.\n\n01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.880\nOops.\n\n01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.880\nAll right.\n\n01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:41.880\nLet me ask you a question.\n\n01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:42.880\nSidebar.\n\n01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880\nOkay.\n\n01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880\nThis takes no time.\n\n01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.880\nQuick.\n\n01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.880\nAnyway, even though it takes no time.\n\n01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.880\nTensors floating desk.\n\n01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.880\nYeah.\n\n01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.880\nIt takes up space, right?\n\n01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.880\nWe've written upon it.\n\n01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.880\nSo, it's a thing that physically occupies space.\n\n01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.880\nYeah.\n\n01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.880\nCan I cast it through a wall?\n\n01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.880\nMy objective would be to cast Tensors floating desk\n\n01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.880\nas a wedge, Indiana Jones style,\n\n01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.880\nlike wedge the...\n\n01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.880\nlike create a space that couldn't, you know, to hold it.\n\n01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.880\nOkay.\n\n01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.880\nSo, if this was like a weak force\n\n01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.880\nthat wouldn't be capable of crushing a human to death,\n\n01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.880\nlike that might function.\n\n01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.880\nRight.\n\n01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.880\nSo, you don't have line of effect to the target.\n\n01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.880\nRight.\n\n01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:21.880\nOkay.\n\n01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.880\nTo my understanding.\n\n01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.880\nAll right.\n\n01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.880\nAll right.\n\n01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.880\nFine.\n\n01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:26.880\nAnybody out in the audience have any ideas for this?\n\n01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.880\nMagic hand.\n\n01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:28.880\nMagic hand, says Jeremy.\n\n01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.880\nA hole.\n\n01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.880\nA hole.\n\n01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880\nI'm dying.\n\n01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.880\nOr the portable hole?\n\n01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.880\nIs there a hole?\n\n01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.880\nIs it nearby?\n\n01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.880\nYou don't have the portable hole.\n\n01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.880\nNo, you got...\n\n01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.880\nI don't have the portable...\n\n01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880\nI don't have a...\n\n01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.880\nWhat is this?\n\n01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:40.880\nA portable wire?\n\n01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.880\nNo, that's not a hole.\n\n01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.880\nNope.\n\n01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.880\nI have Mage Hand, but I already...\n\n01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.880\nI asked about that last week.\n\n01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.880\nThat can only inflict very light forces.\n\n01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.880\nYeah, it says five pounds of force somewhere.\n\n01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.880\nYeah, it's pretty weak.\n\n01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:50.880\nWhy did you ask that hair dryer?\n\n01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.880\nHow big is the ruby?\n\n01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.880\nHow big is the ruby?\n\n01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.880\nDoes it have girth?\n\n01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.880\nI'd say it's about...\n\n01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.880\nDoes the ruby have girth?\n\n01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.880\nSomebody asks.\n\n01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.880\nI think I know the answer.\n\n01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880\nWait.\n\n01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.880\nWhat were you going to say, sir?\n\n01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.880\nIs it larger than the width of a human body?\n\n01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.880\nI'd say, yeah.\n\n01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.880\nIt's roughly the size of a manhole cover.\n\n01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880\nOkay.\n\n01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.880\nCan he line up the ruby and wedge himself like...\n\n01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.880\nIf he left it out, perhaps.\n\n01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.880\nI think I'm going to lift that ruby out.\n\n01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880\nAll right.\n\n01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.880\nSounds like a good plan.\n\n01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.880\nWhat's the hole like?\n\n01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.880\nIs a hole big enough for him to get inside or not?\n\n01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.880\nThere's not a hole so much as a socket in which a ruby is sitting.\n\n01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.880\nRight.\n\n01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.880\nOkay.\n\n01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.880\nAnyway, you tug at the ruby with all your might.\n\n01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880\nIt begins to budge.\n\n01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.880\nYou think you're making good progress.\n\n01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.880\nIt's going to take a couple more tugs or so.\n\n01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.880\nThe wall continues its approach.\n\n01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.880\nTug, Chris.\n\n01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.880\nTug.\n\n01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.880\nI'm tugging.\n\n01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.880\nI'm tugging.\n\n01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.880\nContinuing to tug.\n\n01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880\nI'm continuing to tug.\n\n01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880\nContinuing to tug.\n\n01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.880\nYou increase your tugging speed and intensity.\n\n01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880\nI'm going faster.\n\n01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.880\nAre you masturbating in there?\n\n01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.880\nThat's what I just realized.\n\n01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.880\nNo, I'm tugging at a ruby, man.\n\n01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.880\nAll right.\n\n01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.880\nOkay.\n\n01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.880\nSoon the oval ruby grows dislodged from its socket and you can see below a deep dark hole.\n\n01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880\nWhoa.\n\n01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880\nWhoa.\n\n01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.880\nOkay, wait.\n\n01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880\nOh, I didn't mean to make fun of you.\n\n01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.880\nSorry.\n\n01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.880\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.880\nThat's my natural reaction.\n\n01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880\nThat was my...\n\n01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880\nYeah.\n\n01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880\nThat was your natural reaction to your natural reaction.\n\n01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880\nWell, there you go.\n\n01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.880\nI'm enjoying myself.\n\n01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.880\nChris, can you get inside the hole that the ruby occupied?\n\n01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.880\nIs it big enough for you?\n\n01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:18.880\nDefinitely.\n\n01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.880\nWell, I will...\n\n01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:25.880\nI think I'm going to throw that 150-foot rope down the hole and we can all climb.\n\n01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.880\nWell, you can climb.\n\n01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.880\nIt's just you in that little section right now.\n\n01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880\nOh, well, I'll climb.\n\n01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:30.880\nYeah.\n\n01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.880\nAll right.\n\n01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.880\nI'm going to climb down this hole.\n\n01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.880\nQuickly, throwing the rope down to the hatch.\n\n01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.880\nYou notice that it's not tied to anything.\n\n01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.880\nIt falls down the hole.\n\n01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.880\nDon't throw the rope down before you tie it to something, Chris.\n\n01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.880\nI can't cast reduced person through the thing.\n\n01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.880\nI need to line a site.\n\n01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880\nYeah.\n\n01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880\nYeah, maybe you can save that rope.\n\n01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.880\nNo way.\n\n01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880\nHe doesn't know what's happening.\n\n01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880\nDid he just throw the rope down the hole?\n\n01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.880\nYeah.\n\n01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.880\nJust throwing it like a piece of garbage?\n\n01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.880\nBye, rope.\n\n01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.880\nJesus.\n\n01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.880\nCan you shimmy down or climb down?\n\n01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.880\nThe wall continues its approach.\n\n01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880\nFuck, dude.\n\n01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.880\nWell, I guess I'm going to jump down this hole.\n\n01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.880\nI mean, here we go.\n\n01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.880\nTry going down slowly, like with your hands out.\n\n01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.880\nYeah, can I do that?\n\n01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880\nAm I that cool?\n\n01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.880\nI mean, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.880\nOh, no.\n\n01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.880\nYou know what?\n\n01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.880\nI have this crazy skill that I saw earlier.\n\n01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.880\nIt's called Master Climbing Kit.\n\n01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:16.880\nI'm going to use that.\n\n01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.880\nOkay.\n\n01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.880\nWell, that would work if you had a rope.\n\n01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:24.880\nFuck, this fucking rope is going to be the death of me.\n\n01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880\nWait.\n\n01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.880\nCan I use my anchor to slow down the wall?\n\n01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.880\nWhat?\n\n01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.880\nCan I use my anchor to slow down the wall?\n\n01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880\nYour anchor.\n\n01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.880\nThat it would you, if you could dock it to something on the wall.\n\n01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880\nOkay.\n\n01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880\nYou look at the wall.\n\n01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.880\nIt doesn't have any dockable surfaces for an anchor to attach to.\n\n01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880\nOtherwise, yeah.\n\n01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.880\nOkay.\n\n01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.880\nIf you're talking about Quall's Feather Token, it creates a magical anchor.\n\n01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.880\nOkay.\n\n01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.880\nI feed Coco a carrot.\n\n01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.880\nCoco's out of the dungeon.\n\n01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.880\nSorry.\n\n01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.880\nI'm going to jump down the hole.\n\n01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.880\nI mean, what's happening?\n\n01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.880\nYou lowered yourself down the hole, but you fail and you fall.\n\n01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.880\nUh-oh.\n\n01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.880\nOh.\n\n01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.880\nYou fall into the dark abyss.\n\n01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.880\nYou got it.\n\n01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880\nI found it all room.\n\n01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.880\nIt's Goonies.\n\n01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.880\nI thought you were doing a really bad Camel impression.\n\n01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.880\nWait.\n\n01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:08.880\nAm I dying?\n\n01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.880\nIs this happening?\n\n01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.880\nMaybe.\n\n01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.880\nYou tumble through darkness until you land in a pile of something.\n\n01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.880\nIs this what happens when you die?\n\n01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.880\nUntil you land in a pile of something squishy, dry, and dusty.\n\n01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.880\nWhen you land, you feel a great cloud of dust releasing into the air, invading your lungs,\n\n01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.880\nburning and itching.\n\n01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.880\nOh.\n\n01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.880\nYou cough incessantly for a bit and feel sick and almost immediately.\n\n01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.880\nTo no effect, though.\n\n01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.880\nYou managed to shake it off.\n\n01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.880\nNot bad.\n\n01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:37.880\nAll right.\n\n01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.880\nNow, has the wall gone all the way across the room?\n\n01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.880\nYou see the wall for a bit.\n\n01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.880\nIt strains as if it's trying to smash something and then you hear a crumpling.\n\n01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.880\nThe wall strikes the far wall.\n\n01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.880\nBefore you, you can see a giant green mosaic of a dragon.\n\n01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.880\nBut in place of its mouth, you only see a dark hole.\n\n01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.880\nSo that's the hole that Christopher just fell through?\n\n01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.880\nI don't know.\n\n01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.880\nLike you don't know.\n\n01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880\nOh.\n\n01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.880\nI yell down the hole, Chris, you okay?\n\n01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.880\nYeah, I'm all right.\n\n01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:06.880\nAh, shit.\n\n01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:10.880\nI wanted to do the thing in the movies where we reveal how we felt about the character\n\n01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.880\nbecause we think he's dead.\n\n01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.880\nBut I guess he has to come up behind us at the end of that.\n\n01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.880\nSo never mind.\n\n01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:17.880\nNever mind.\n\n01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.880\nStupid.\n\n01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:19.880\nWe'll do it another time.\n\n01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.880\nSo you're in pitch darkness right now.\n\n01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.880\nYou can't see a thing.\n\n01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880\nOh, but I can hear like my buddy.\n\n01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.880\nDefinitely.\n\n01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.880\nDefinitely.\n\n01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.880\nHey, Christopher.\n\n01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.880\nHello there.\n\n01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:28.880\nI'm fine.\n\n01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.880\nBut I can't see anything, though.\n\n01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.880\nI need those cool glasses that you have.\n\n01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.880\nActually, does he have?\n\n01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:35.880\nMaybe.\n\n01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.880\nI light a torch and toss it down into him so he can see his way down there.\n\n01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.880\nYou light a torch and toss it down to him so he can see his way down there.\n\n01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.880\nIt looks like I can see now.\n\n01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.880\nYou just barely managed to catch it.\n\n01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.880\nWhoa, there I got it.\n\n01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.880\nOkay, so walking through this crazy dark tunnel.\n\n01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.880\nOh, I should stop you.\n\n01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.880\nYou're sitting on what appears to be a giant mushroom.\n\n01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.880\nIt's what released this great cloud of dust in the air.\n\n01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.880\nThat doesn't sound good.\n\n01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:09.880\nGlancing around quickly, you can see the wall is covered in large fist-sized holes.\n\n01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:14.880\nYou can also see a large metal door with a huge, elaborate locking mechanism.\n\n01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.880\nA lot of people get frustrated when they land in a mushroom.\n\n01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.880\nThat's why the fist-sized hole.\n\n01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.880\nYou hear hissing.\n\n01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.880\nThe sounds of hissing.\n\n01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.880\nUh-oh.\n\n01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.880\nUh-oh.\n\n01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.880\nThat means snake.\n\n01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.880\nWell, or a tire leak.\n\n01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.880\nYeah, well, I don't think there's any tires around here.\n\n01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880\nHey, Christopher.\n\n01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.880\nYeah, I think there's a snake down here.\n\n01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.880\nIf you guys could come down, that'd be great.\n\n01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.880\nJust help me out.\n\n01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.880\nCan you throw us the rope?\n\n01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:41.880\nOh, right, right.\n\n01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:42.880\nI have a rope.\n\n01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:43.880\nI have that staff.\n\n01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.880\nI can throw the rope at the button.\n\n01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.880\nOh, we can climb down the button staff.\n\n01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.880\nI used the button staff.\n\n01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.880\nUsing the button staff, you erect a rope.\n\n01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.880\nI mean, not a rope.\n\n01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:52.880\nThat's stupid.\n\n01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:53.880\nYou erect a staff.\n\n01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.880\nIt reaches all the way down below.\n\n01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.880\nNice.\n\n01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.880\nI'm going to grab this staff and ride my way up.\n\n01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.880\nI'm a witch.\n\n01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.880\nI slide down behind Sharpie, and we both do, like,\n\n01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.880\nBatman and Robin quips.\n\n01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.880\nHoly mushroom powder Sharpie.\n\n01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.880\nBut at some point, we hit Christopher,\n\n01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.880\nwho's coming up, right?\n\n01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.880\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.880\nDid you plant the rods so that it was in the mushroom\n\n01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.880\nor not on the mushroom?\n\n01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.880\nThe floor next to the mushroom.\n\n01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:25.880\nOkay.\n\n01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:26.880\nThen you don't hit him.\n\n01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.880\nWait, he said he was climbing up the pole.\n\n01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.880\nOh, well, then you do hit him.\n\n01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.880\nOuch.\n\n01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.880\nYou're at an impasse.\n\n01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:34.880\nI'm coming up here.\n\n01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.880\nWell, we're coming down.\n\n01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.880\nWell, I'm coming up.\n\n01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.880\nI don't know if you want to come down,\n\n01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.880\nbecause I heard some hissing.\n\n01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.880\nCould be a snake.\n\n01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.880\nYou're coming up?\n\n01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.880\nI guess so.\n\n01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:44.880\nIs that cool?\n\n01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.880\nI guess we better get this party started.\n\n01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.880\nAll right.\n\n01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.880\nFuck you.\n\n01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:57.880\nIt was delicious low-hanging fruit.\n\n01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.880\nWell, maybe I'll stay put.\n\n01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.880\nYeah, listen, I understand your impulse to come back up,\n\n01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.880\nbecause you were previously in a situation\n\n01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.880\nwhere you weren't able to come back up,\n\n01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.880\nso your first instinct is to come up.\n\n01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.880\nBut speaking on behalf of the people that were up\n\n01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.880\nand couldn't come down,\n\n01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.880\nI'm saying the grass is always greener on the other side,\n\n01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.880\nvertically or horizontally.\n\n01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.880\nLike, we're coming down.\n\n01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.880\nI suggest you stay down.\n\n01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.880\nI don't get the grass here, though.\n\n01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.880\nJust get down.\n\n01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.880\nI also go down.\n\n01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:22.880\nIt's dark.\n\n01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.880\nThe combined weight of everyone going down at once\n\n01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.880\novercomes.\n\n01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.880\nGuys, we got to start fucking cooperating a little bit.\n\n01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.880\nEspecially on ladders.\n\n01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:35.880\nThat shit's dangerous.\n\n01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:38.880\nWell, I thought they were already down.\n\n01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.880\nI think that the way it's painted in my head,\n\n01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:42.880\nthere's a rod.\n\n01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.880\nRight.\n\n01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.880\nIt is standing next to a mushroom.\n\n01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.880\nYeah.\n\n01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.880\nHe's climbing up.\n\n01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:47.880\nYep.\n\n01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.880\nHis face is basically in your underrows.\n\n01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:50.880\nYep.\n\n01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.880\nAnd now you two have come atop.\n\n01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:53.880\nYeah.\n\n01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.880\nAnd that's causing the whole assembly\n\n01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.880\nto slide down slowly to the floor.\n\n01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.880\nCan I use my long, beautiful hair as wings and float down?\n\n01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:01.880\nYeah.\n\n01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.880\nIt's like a parachute lifted slowly to the ground.\n\n01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:04.880\nThank you.\n\n01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.880\nWhoa, guys.\n\n01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.880\nI cast feather fall and get off the pole, too.\n\n01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.880\nIf Christopher wants to go up and, you know,\n\n01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.880\ngo start his music career, you can.\n\n01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:14.880\nAll right.\n\n01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.880\nAre we all down by the mushroom?\n\n01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.880\nThat's true.\n\n01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:18.880\nOkay.\n\n01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.880\nSo I look around.\n\n01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.880\nWhat's going on down there?\n\n01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:21.880\nYou see a wall.\n\n01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:22.880\nYou see, it's a rounded chamber.\n\n01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:26.880\nSome might say Ovaloid.\n\n01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:27.880\nSome might say what?\n\n01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:30.880\nThere's definitely fist-sized holes dotting the walls.\n\n01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.880\nYou can hear the hissing that he was talking about earlier.\n\n01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:34.880\nIt's in fact growing stronger.\n\n01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.880\nYou know, that hissing is coming from behind the wall.\n\n01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:39.880\nThere's also a large metal door.\n\n01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.880\nIt's embedded in the wall.\n\n01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.880\nIt's the only door you can see.\n\n01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.880\nIt has a large elaborate locking mechanism\n\n01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.880\nand a large keyhole in it.\n\n01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.880\nI got a feeling you hit that lock wrong.\n\n01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:50.880\nSnakes through those holes.\n\n01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.880\nAm I right?\n\n01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:52.880\nNo, man.\n\n01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.880\nGood theory, man.\n\n01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:56.880\nWell, isn't Christopher, he's good at locks, right?\n\n01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:57.880\nHe's a thief, isn't he?\n\n01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880\nTrue.\n\n01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.880\nYes.\n\n01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.880\nYou know, but I don't know if I want to let these snakes out.\n\n01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.880\nRight, so to speak.\n\n01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.880\nIt's like a song.\n\n01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.880\nIt's not a song, but...\n\n01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:08.880\nPiss, piss, piss.\n\n01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:09.880\nI'm not sure.\n\n01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:13.880\nI mean, to keep things lively, I guess I'll move forward\n\n01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.880\nand open the lock with my lock skills.\n\n01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:16.880\nOkay.\n\n01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.880\nLock undoing skills.\n\n01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:18.880\nBefore you can head to the lock,\n\n01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.880\nMulraine, out of the corner of your eye, you can see snakes\n\n01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.880\npouring out of a few of the holes to the southwest.\n\n01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.880\nYou guys.\n\n01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:29.880\nMulraine, don't you have animal husbandry or something?\n\n01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.880\nCan we just climb back up the staff?\n\n01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.880\nI do.\n\n01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.880\nI have...\n\n01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.880\nActually, I don't know.\n\n01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.880\nYou hear a rumbling overhead.\n\n01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.880\nI have handle animal.\n\n01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.880\nCan I use handle animal with these snakes?\n\n01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.880\nI use handle animal.\n\n01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.880\nI handle the snakes.\n\n01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.880\nI handle all those animals.\n\n01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:52.880\nOkay.\n\n01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.880\nAnd then I pitch a kids' show to Nickelodeon called\n\n01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.880\nHandle Animals.\n\n01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.880\nYou attempt to handle the snake.\n\n01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:04.880\nIt rises up and seems to be swaying slowly from side to side.\n\n01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.880\nSexy.\n\n01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.880\nYou hear hissing behind you.\n\n01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.880\nCool?\n\n01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.880\nI turn around.\n\n01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.880\nI think they want to dance with you.\n\n01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.880\nYou see a few more snakes pouring out of the hole.\n\n01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.880\nHandle animals is what we would need.\n\n01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.880\nOkay, okay, okay, okay.\n\n01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.880\nIs this mushroom possibly something we could use in some way?\n\n01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.880\nI thought at first I should take a bite.\n\n01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.880\nOpen the fucking door.\n\n01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.880\nUnlock the door.\n\n01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.880\nI was trying to, but then the snakes started coming out.\n\n01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.880\nWell, that's a lie.\n\n01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.880\nI have a sack.\n\n01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:35.880\nI have a sack.\n\n01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.880\nI take my sack and I hold it up to the holes.\n\n01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.880\nAnd I'm also handling the animals.\n\n01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.880\nI handle them into my sack.\n\n01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.880\nI'm going to open the...\n\n01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.880\nI'm not talking about jerking off, right?\n\n01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.880\nI'm going to undo the...\n\n01:19:48.880 -->

should be something that says open lock,\n\n01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.880\nand then there should be a number somewhere.\n\n01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.880\nThe right side, yeah.\n\n01:19:57.880 -->

01:21:21.880\nI'll play them a song.\n\n01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.880\nWhere's diplomacy Spencer on my front page?\n\n01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.880\nIt's on the right side where your skills are.\n\n01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.880\nIt's alphabetical.\n\n01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.880\nOh, okay.\n\n01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.880\nOkay.\n\n01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.880\nOkay.\n\n01:21:29.880

definitely.\n\n01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.880\nOkay.\n\n01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.880\nI do that.\n\n01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.880\nYou'll have to do it stealthily\n\n01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:40.880\nto evade detection.\n\n01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.880\nI do it stealthily.\n\n01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:42.880\nYou do it stealthily\n\n01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.880\nto evade detection.\n\n01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.880\nAre they threatening us?\n\n01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.880\nThey're holding bows drawn at you.\n\n01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.880\nWell, I'm going to say,\n\n01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.880\nlook, it's your cousin from long afar\n\n01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.880\nand she misses you guys.\n\n01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:57.880\nWhy haven't you wrote scrolls\n\n01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.880\ndetailing how you're doing to her?\n\n01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.880\nActually, they are pointing arrows.\n\n01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:03.880\nI'll tone it down.\n\n01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:04.880\nAnyway, this is your cousin.\n\n01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.880\nI can cool it.\n\n01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.880\nEverybody's talking at once.\n\n01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.880\nIt doesn't seem very convincing.\n\n01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.880\nBut then, I take my emerald green dagger\n\n01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.880\nand I go over to Mulraine disguised\n\n01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:16.880\nas one of these green people\n\n01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:17.880\nand I say, Mulraine, this is not going\n\n01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:18.880\nto be what it looks like.\n\n01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:19.880\nI'm going to pretend that we're\n\n01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.880\nholding you as a hostage\n\n01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.880\nbecause you look like one of them.\n\n01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:22.880\nBut I'm not going to do anything bad.\n\n01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.880\nSo I put my dagger up to Mulraine\n\n01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.880\nso I'm going to go,\n\n01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.880\nhey, open that door and let us through\n\n01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.880\nor your friend gets it.\n\n01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:30.880\nHe means it.\n\n01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.880\nYou hear the voice of the dagger call out.\n\n01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.880\nHey, hey, snake dudes.\n\n01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.880\nThis guy's totally lying.\n\n01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.880\nIt's a trick.\n\n01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:37.880\nThat dagger, man.\n\n01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.880\nWhy would my dagger do that?\n\n01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.880\nBecause it's an intelligent item.\n\n01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:42.880\nOkay, I put the dagger away.\n\n01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.880\nI take a sword out.\n\n01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.880\nIt doesn't talk back.\n\n01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.880\nThat's true.\n\n01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.880\nOkay, I take my sword out.\n\n01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:53.880\nThat's the thing I got at a Renaissance fair.\n\n01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.880\nAnywho, I take my sword out\n\n01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.880\nand I hold it up to Mulraine disguised\n\n01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.880\nand I say, hey, open that door.\n\n01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:03.880\nOpen that door.\n\n01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.880\nYour friend gets it.\n\n01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.880\nWhat's your diplomacy, Jeff?\n\n01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.880\nMy diplomacy is 10 with a 3 and a 7.\n\n01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:13.880\nWith a minor in theology.\n\n01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.880\nThis is 10, then 3, then 7, whatever that means.\n\n01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:18.880\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.880\nThat makes sense.\n\n01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.880\nOh, so it's math.\n\n01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880\nOkay.\n\n01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.880\nSometimes it's math.\n\n01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.880\nYeah.\n\n01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.880\nYou seem convincing.\n\n01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.880\nThe lead snake person mulls over the options.\n\n01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.880\nI use Intimidate, too.\n\n01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:32.880\nWell, you gotta pick one.\n\n01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.880\nSo diplomacy or Intimidate?\n\n01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.880\nAh, shit.\n\n01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:36.880\nIntimidate.\n\n01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:37.880\nIntimidate.\n\n01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:38.880\nOkay.\n\n01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.880\nHe stops for it and he's like, wait a second.\n\n01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.880\nYou shouldn't kill one of our own.\n\n01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.880\nProbably.\n\n01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.880\nAlso, I'm frightened.\n\n01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.880\nOh, snake people.\n\n01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.880\nOh, so superior because your backs bend\n\n01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:57.880\nin different ways.\n\n01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:00.880\nWe of the primates just come to pay honor to you\n\n01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.880\nfor your blood runs cold and your hearts are but two chambers.\n\n01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.880\nOr maybe even one, I can't remember.\n\n01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.880\nIt's true, brethren.\n\n01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.880\nI came upon them.\n\n01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.880\nThey were making posters paying homage to our people.\n\n01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.880\nWe're just here to hang out.\n\n01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.880\nWe love lizard people.\n\n01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.880\nHe seems lizard people, yeah.\n\n01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.880\nThat was bad, right?\n\n01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.880\nYeah, no, that's insulting, in fact.\n\n01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.880\nOh, no.\n\n01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.880\nHe seems a bit enamored by your speech\n\n01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:31.880\nafter being frightened by the known barbarians.\n\n01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:34.880\nWe got to get in the same page here, you guys.\n\n01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.880\nWe're sending mixed messages.\n\n01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.880\nBut the snake man to the left, he looks a bit unstable.\n\n01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:44.880\nHe freaks out and he hits the one in the middle.\n\n01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.880\nFuck it, that happened.\n\n01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.880\nThey're hitting each other?\n\n01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.880\nOne of the guys, he jabs them sharply in the ribs.\n\n01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.880\nHe's like, hey, get a friggin' grip.\n\n01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.880\nOh, I see.\n\n01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.880\nLet's keep it safe.\n\n01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.880\nSafe to work.\n\n01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.880\nOh, look at this guy over here.\n\n01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.880\nI walk over to him, go, what's with this guy, huh?\n\n01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.880\nI walk around, I go, before that happens,\n\n01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.880\nthe one on the left says, hey, hold it, hold it, hold it.\n\n01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:08.880\nNo, no, no, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool.\n\n01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.880\nI'm just saying, let's get along.\n\n01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:18.880\nI'm relying on my elongated S's to woo them into...\n\n01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880\nPretty tricky.\n\n01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:23.880\nHey, everybody, let's just say we're just here to\n\n01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.880\nservice the idea of getting along.\n\n01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.880\nWhile he's doing that, I walk around one of the\n\n01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.880\nagitated snake guy and I get down on my hands and knees\n\n01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.880\nlike a Hopin' Crosby kind of thing.\n\n01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:42.880\nAt the end of the days, all we are is just a bunch of\n\n01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.880\nslaves to work it for the weekend and I push them.\n\n01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.880\nUh-oh.\n\n01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:51.880\nFor a second, you don't think this half-ass plan is going to work.\n\n01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:56.880\nBut Quark, being naturally sneaky, manages to crawl into position.\n\n01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.880\nThinking fast or whatever you had mentioned, you push him over Quark.\n\n01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.880\nAll right, you see what happened there?\n\n01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:06.880\nThe rest of you, following the fucking liner, will trip you too.\n\n01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.880\nThey shoot arrows at you.\n\n01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.880\nUh...\n\n01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:10.880\nI...\n\n01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.880\nThe arrows hit and you feel a bit woozy.\n\n01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:17.880\nIf there was something coating the poison in those arrows.\n\n01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:18.880\nUh-oh.\n\n01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:19.880\nOh, no.\n\n01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.880\nTricky business indeed.\n\n01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880\nWho was hit, Spencer?\n\n01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:22.880\nIt hit...\n\n01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.880\nBoth of the arrows hit Dan.\n\n01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.880\nOh.\n\n01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.880\nOh, no.\n\n01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.880\nI like fire flames in my eyes.\n\n01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.880\nI take out my arrows.\n\n01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:39.880\nI fire two arrows at the snake people and they're looking at me like,\n\n01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:40.880\nWhat?\n\n01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:41.880\nYou're one of a...\n\n01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.880\nBut I do it.\n\n01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.880\nNice.\n\n01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.880\nSo what kind of arrows?\n\n01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.880\nPerfect ones?\n\n01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:51.880\nObsidian.\n\n01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:52.880\nObsidian.\n\n01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880\nVieros.\n\n01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.880\nVieros.\n\n01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880\nWith a woody feel.\n\n01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.880\nThe Vieros.\n\n01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.880\nThe cedar.\n\n01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:58.880\nOh, cedar.\n\n01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.880\nOkay.\n\n01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:00.880\nI fire two Vieros.\n\n01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.880\nOkay, so are you shooting them at one person or two people?\n\n01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:05.880\nI'm the two most dangerous.\n\n01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:06.880\nTwo people.\n\n01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:07.880\nOkay, so you fire at them.\n\n01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.880\nTwo people.\n\n01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:09.880\nYes.\n\n01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.880\nBoth of their arrows strike their mark.\n\n01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.880\nAll right.\n\n01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:13.880\nOh, nice.\n\n01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.880\nQuite the archer art you are, you know?\n\n01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.880\nYour regular green arrow.\n\n01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.880\nThank you.\n\n01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.880\nOne of them takes seven damage, the other three.\n\n01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.880\nI stand up into a flaming sword attack on the other snake person.\n\n01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.880\nLeaping quickly to your feet.\n\n01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.880\nYou grab your sword and thrust it viciously into the...\n\n01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.880\nWhich one did you say?\n\n01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.880\nThe one that we knocked over, the one that's on the ground.\n\n01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.880\nThe knocked over one.\n\n01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.880\nWith my loot or mandolin, whatever, can I score the whole action scene?\n\n01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880\nIs there doing all that?\n\n01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880\nDo you have a loot?\n\n01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.880\nIf you do, it should be.\n\n01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.880\nYou could, potentially.\n\n01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:50.880\nOr you could get in the fucking fight, Christopher.\n\n01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:53.880\nNo, I mean, I just want...\n\n01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.880\nYeah, I mean, all right.\n\n01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:00.880\nI'll help my homie out and, you know, claw him on the head or something.\n\n01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.880\nYeah, I'll use my bow and shoot arrows also.\n\n01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:04.880\nAll right, well...\n\n01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.880\nAt the last guy?\n\n01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:11.880\nQuark with his, you know, his flaming sword strikes the fallen snake.\n\n01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:12.880\nHe dies.\n\n01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:13.880\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.880\nNice.\n\n01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:15.880\nGreat job.\n\n01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:16.880\nSee, that's so hard.\n\n01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:17.880\nYeah.\n\n01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.880\nYou dealt 19 damage.\n\n01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:19.880\nOkay.\n\n01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:20.880\nQuite a feat.\n\n01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:21.880\nOh, man.\n\n01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.880\nDo we get, like, points and shit?\n\n01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.880\nExperience ones, yes.\n\n01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.880\nYeah, that's cool.\n\n01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.880\nOkay, so now do the thing that you're going to do.\n\n01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.880\nWait, divided among us or does he get them all?\n\n01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.880\nOh, it's divided.\n\n01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.880\nDon't you worry.\n\n01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:32.880\nYeah.\n\n01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.880\nI'll take care of you.\n\n01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:34.880\nThat's cool, man.\n\n01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:35.880\nI got some points.\n\n01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.880\nYou were going to do something, though, with a bow, maybe?\n\n01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:38.880\nWhat was it?\n\n01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:39.880\nMe?\n\n01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:40.880\nYeah.\n\n01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.880\nOh, well, there's nothing left to do.\n\n01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:42.880\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.880\nThere's two other guys.\n\n01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:44.880\nWell, I will shoot.\n\n01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:48.880\nI got to divide experience points with this guy.\n\n01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.880\nI'm going to, sorry.\n\n01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.880\nI'm going to, like, shoot one, like, really fast, like, one bow, one guy, one bow with\n\n01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:55.880\nthe other guy.\n\n01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:56.880\nI mean, arrow.\n\n01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.880\nOkay, so you can almost shoot one arrow.\n\n01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.380\nI stand behind Chris and I cross my arms and I nod my head as if I taught him everything\n\n01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:01.880\nhe knows, but I know I didn't.\n\n01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:02.880\nBut it looks like I did.\n\n01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.880\nWell, you can shoot one arrow, so pick a target.\n\n01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:06.880\nLeft or right?\n\n01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:07.880\nOh, okay.\n\n01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:09.880\nI mean, I guess you always go left.\n\n01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:10.880\nWell, maybe right.\n\n01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:11.880\nI'll go left.\n\n01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.880\nI'll go left.\n\n01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.880\nMy first answer seems right, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:18.880\nYour arrow strikes true, hitting the snake right in the chest.\n\n01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:19.880\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:20.880\nAh.\n\n01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:22.880\nIt deals 10 damage.\n\n01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:23.880\nAll right.\n\n01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.880\nThe snake goes down.\n\n01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:31.880\nThe other snake freaks out and turns into a snake, an actual snake this time.\n\n01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.880\nAnd slithers away into the hole behind.\n\n01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:34.880\nAh.\n\n01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:35.880\nI want to stop him.\n\n01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.880\nDo you want to try and stop him?\n\n01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.880\nYeah, I want to grab him.\n\n01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:40.880\nWhat's your dexterity?\n\n01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.880\nWell, that's not looking good, man.\n\n01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.880\n14 plus 2, it says.\n\n01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.880\nPlus 2, yeah.\n\n01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.880\nHe manages to worm away.\n\n01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:48.880\nMe.\n\n01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.880\nI whip him.\n\n01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.880\nIt's too heavy.\n\n01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:52.880\nI like your thought.\n\n01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:53.880\nCan I make a go at it?\n\n01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:54.880\nI whip him.\n\n01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:55.880\nI use my whip.\n\n01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:56.880\nOkay.\n\n01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:57.880\nYour magical whip.\n\n01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:58.880\nOkay.\n\n01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:02.880\nSo it's going to take a minor action, and then you whip.\n\n01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.880\nYou miss, so, well, there you go.\n\n01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:09.880\nChris, while we were fighting these people, did you have any luck opening that door?\n\n01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:10.880\nThat's true.\n\n01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.880\nIn this time, the door has now been unlocked.\n\n01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:14.880\nAh.\n\n01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.880\nI earned some points there.\n\n01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:17.880\nWhere am I keep?\n\n01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:20.880\nI open the door and peer through it.\n\n01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.880\nYou peer through the open door.\n\n01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.880\nNo, what's happening?\n\n01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:31.880\nAs you open the door to the threshold, you are assaulted by the sharp abrasive smell of the chamber air.\n\n01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:34.880\nThick and heavy, but clawing at your eyes and nose.\n\n01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:39.880\nA sharp tang of vinegar and incredibly pungent sour aroma invades your senses.\n\n01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.880\nWell, we're at the drawing room.\n\n01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:49.880\nYou can see a large stone chamber in the center of which is three large humanoid statues that are beginning to crumble.\n\n01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:55.880\nNext, behind the statues is a large staircase leading up about 80 feet high in tiered steps.\n\n01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.880\nAt the top, you can see chests and barrels and what appear to be a massive sarcophagus\n\n01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:04.880\nmade of obsidian surrounded by several forms of tribute.\n\n01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.880\nGold heaps of gold.\n\n01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.880\nRich!\n\n01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:12.880\nI turn into Sharpie and I start to do a high five and go, not again!\n\n01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:15.880\nIt's in the way that you use it!\n\n01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.880\nAnd credit starts to roll.\n\n01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:18.880\nFreeze frame.\n\n01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.880\nWe'll divvy up that treasure.\n\n01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.880\nCliffhanger!\n\n01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.880\nSpencer, everybody, once again.\n\n01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:29.880\nErin McGathy!\n\n01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:30.880\nAbed Gheith.\n\n01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.880\nAbed Gheith.\n\n01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.880\nAbed Tiny Food Gaith.\n\n01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:38.880\nThank you, Abed.\n\n01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.880\nEnjoy those fashion beasts.\n\n01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:41.880\nI will.\n\n01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.880\nI'll let you know what it's like.\n\n01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:44.880\nThat was an alright show.\n\n01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.880\nI'll give that a Burbank 8.\n\n01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:49.880\nA Burbank 8?\n\n01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:51.880\nYeah, you know, Burbank, you know, lower it, you know.\n\n01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.880\nLike, you know.\n\n01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.880\nOh, what the fuck?\n\n01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:57.880\nOh, shit!\n\n01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:58.880\nWait.\n\n01:31:58.880 --> 01:31:59.880\nGod damn it.\n\n01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:03.880\nThis is going to be hard to describe with the podcast listeners.\n\n01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.880\nAn apparition just appeared on stage.\n\n01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.880\nIt's our good friend BJ, everybody.\n\n01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:14.880\nBJ, briefly, briefly for the people listening in Indiana and whatnot.\n\n01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:18.880\nBJ comes on stage wearing pink leopard or cheetah jaguar?\n\n01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:19.880\nWhat is that?\n\n01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.880\nTrousers.\n\n01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:21.880\nIt's a pink leopard.\n\n01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:23.880\nPink leopard trousers.\n\n01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:25.880\nIt's got rainbow bright moon boots.\n\n01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.880\nYeah, punky broosters, giant shoes.\n\n01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:28.880\nYeah, thank you.\n\n01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:33.880\nThey're not strawberry shortcake boots, as previously said by someone not here.\n\n01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:38.880\nAnd there's a red tartan jacket, open shirt, hairy chest, a colorful scarf.\n\n01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:40.880\nBJ, how should we end the show?\n\n01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:48.880\nI traveled back all the way from the future just to figure out how to end this show.\n\n01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.880\nHow about with a song?\n\n01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.880\nWhat's the future like, BJ?\n\n01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:53.880\nYeah.\n\n01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.880\nIt's bright.\n\n01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.880\nBecause the sun's bigger?\n\n01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.880\nThere's more than one.\n\n01:32:58.880 --> 01:32:59.880\nOh, there's two suns?\n\n01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:01.880\nTwo suns in the future.\n\n01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.880\nOne of them is ours.\n\n01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.880\nWho does the other sun belong to?\n\n01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:12.880\nThe other sun belongs to Jeff.\n\n01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.880\nAnd Jeff has a son.\n\n01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.880\nJeff has a son in the future.\n\n01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.880\nJeff has a son in the future.\n\n01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.880\nA son in the future.\n\n01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.880\nJeff's son from the future.\n\n01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.880\nI got my own son in the future.\n\n01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.880\nIt's me, dad.\n\n01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:26.880\nBJ's your son.\n\n01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:27.880\nThat's who I was all along.\n\n01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.880\nBJ is Jeff's son.\n\n01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.880\nIn the future, BJ is Jeff's son.\n\n01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:33.880\nThis is as far as I can get because of the cord.\n\n01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:36.880\nJeff's story has just begun.\n\n01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:37.880\nSorry, technology.\n\n01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.880\nIn the future, BJ is Jeff's son.\n\n01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.880\nOkay, thanks for catching me.\n\n01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.880\nAnd Jeff adopted himself.\n\n01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.880\nPeople from the present?\n\n01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.880\nHe put his sperm on a shelf.\n\n01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:51.880\nHe impregnated himself and BJ is the resultant answer.\n\n01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.880\nWait, so I have a son that lives in the future?\n\n01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.880\nYes.\n\n01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.880\nAnd he's part you?\n\n01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:57.880\nPart you.\n\n01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.880\nThere is no woman involved.\n\n01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:00.880\nYou finally achieved your dream.\n\n01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.880\nIn the future, it's possible for you to have your dream.\n\n01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.880\nYou can procreate without having to involve any woman.\n\n01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:09.880\nBut how does he go to the future and come back now?\n\n01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.880\nBecause he's part you and part you, he's so smart he can invent time travel.\n\n01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:16.880\nBut is he also a stellar body?\n\n01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.880\nThere's two sons.\n\n01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.880\nOne is the actual star that we call our son.\n\n01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:27.880\nHe is your son and his wardrobe choices are so radiant that he actually is defined as a solar body.\n\n01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:28.880\nSo he's the future me?\n\n01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:29.880\nYeah.\n\n01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:30.880\nI throw up the shackles.\n\n01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:31.880\nAnd the future you?\n\n01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:32.880\nI throw up the suits.\n\n01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.880\nYeah.\n\n01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:37.880\nThe future you is a star.\n\n01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:40.880\nJust like the sun.\n\n01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.880\nAnd the future you likes to drink just like you because drinking is so much fun.\n\n01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.880\nI love my future gay son.\n\n01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:57.880\nThank you for coming to Harmontown everybody.\n\n01:34:57.880 --> 01:34:59.880\nThank you BJ.\n\n01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:00.880\nThank you.\n\n01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:05.880\nThank you Dustin Marshall, Zac McKeever, and Emily Gordon, Jenny Fine.\n\n01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.880\nAlso Jeremy for coming up on stage earlier on.\n\n01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.880\nHello our drunken Scottish friend.\n\n01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.880\nHoppet, Gaith, Erin McAfee.\n\n01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:18.880\nMy foam sword is shiny and sharp.\n\n01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.880\nI fight you mama like life guarding the garb.\n\n01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.880\nI fight you mama in Harmontown all day.\n\n01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.880\nJeff's son's already gay.\n\n01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:31.880\nI'm Jeff Davis.\n\n01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:34.880\nOne more time for Dan Harmon everybody.\n\n01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:40.880\nHarmontown, I fight you mama in Harmontown.\n\n01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.880\nI fight you mama.\n\n01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.880\nI fight you mama on a plate in a bowl.\n\n01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:49.880\nI fight you mama tell her face got a mole.\n\n01:35:49.880 --> 01:36:05.880\nI fight you mama dermatologically speaking.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[179268]}
