00:00.000 --> 00:24.520
Hello Meltdown, how are you all tonight?

00:24.520 --> 00:31.880
Once again, Harmontown is in session in Hollywood, California at the comfortable confines of

00:31.880 --> 00:33.760
Meltdown Comics, NerdMelt Theater.

00:33.760 --> 00:48.800
Won't you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.520
We have so much to do tonight.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.520
What the fuck?

00:52.520 --> 00:56.320
All right, thank you.

00:56.320 --> 01:03.400
All right, tonight's theme is litany, tonight's theme is lists, all right?

01:03.400 --> 01:05.680
Tonight's theme is items on the docket.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.160
I've got a pad of paper and a pen.

01:08.160 --> 01:13.360
I've got a Samsung giant phone, I've got Evernote, I've got a list of shit I want to talk about

01:13.360 --> 01:14.360
tonight.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.880
We're going to do it fast because I just got a note from you in the green room, oh the

01:17.880 --> 01:22.360
shows are too long, they're getting too long, 90 minutes, let's make it 90 minutes.

01:22.360 --> 01:29.840
Yeah, he's like the noid, he's like the noid, he's our enemy.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.800
Nobody wants a two hour show, two hours is too long.

01:33.800 --> 01:42.680
All right, let's fuck, settle in, I hope he brought some snacks.

01:42.680 --> 01:47.240
In Jeff's defense, if we target a 90 minute show, it's a two hour show, so it's like

01:47.240 --> 01:51.840
Jesus Christ, like if you try to be a good person, you end up like okay, yeah, all right,

01:51.840 --> 01:56.120
you chart that star, you don't expect to hit it.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.120
Thank you ma'am.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.880
Somebody yelled out, tweeted, all right, item number one on the list, let's just barrel

02:00.880 --> 02:02.600
through it, let's barrel through it.

02:02.600 --> 02:07.320
The only thing I thought of today, this is from the Rob Delaney department, where I'm

02:07.320 --> 02:14.360
like, in other words, I thought this was clever, okay, you know how when you die you poop your

02:14.360 --> 02:21.520
pants, okay, here's how you solve all of the world's problems, in my opinion, and I don't

02:21.520 --> 02:24.680
know how to enforce this, I don't know how to create this environment, but this would

02:24.680 --> 02:27.000
solve all the world's problems.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.320
When you die, instead of pooping your own pants, you get to choose whose pants you poop

02:32.320 --> 02:33.320
in.

02:33.320 --> 02:37.000
Wait, you can create poop in somebody else's pants?

02:37.000 --> 02:44.840
Every, yeah, every, yeah, so like, every human being on earth, so dick chainie's pants

02:44.840 --> 02:46.480
would constantly be filled with shit.

02:46.480 --> 02:51.040
There would be no dick chainie, he would not do the things he'd done.

02:51.040 --> 02:55.680
He wouldn't do it, he'd go, it's not worth it.

02:55.680 --> 03:00.200
Every minute of every day, it's like a bell ringing and an angel getting a twang, there's

03:00.200 --> 03:04.720
another load in my fucking pants, I can't do it, it's not worth it, what's worth it?

03:04.720 --> 03:10.240
All the oil, all the money in the world, every second another person dies that chooses me,

03:10.240 --> 03:11.560
my pants to crap it.

03:11.560 --> 03:15.160
Also, if you murder somebody and get away with it, the person that you kill gets to poop

03:15.160 --> 03:16.320
in your pants at any time.

03:16.320 --> 03:20.040
Oh, you know they will, you know they will, that's the least they can do.

03:20.040 --> 03:27.360
It's like the game of werewolf, there's a card that you rarely use, I think it's like

03:27.360 --> 03:31.120
a hunter or something and it's like when the werewolf kills the hunter, the hunter gets

03:31.120 --> 03:33.880
to actually pick somebody to take out as they go out.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.580
If everyone had that power, no one would fucking, it's the perfect blend, there's too many people

03:38.580 --> 03:43.120
in this world that chooses a religion, like this idea that they're going to be punished

03:43.120 --> 03:46.200
in the afterlife, that's fucked up because that means you're not on your best behavior

03:46.200 --> 03:47.840
in this world.

03:47.840 --> 03:52.800
You think too much about the afterlife, it's too stupid, it's dumb, you know and then the

03:52.800 --> 03:56.400
other end of the spectrum you have like atheists who are like well, you know what's happening

03:56.400 --> 04:00.160
right here is what's important but they don't have a god so they're not accountable to anything.

04:00.160 --> 04:06.480
The perfect mix, the perfect karmic mix, okay there is no afterlife, fuck that but on your

04:06.480 --> 04:10.600
way out of the game you get to shit in someone's pants, who's it going to be?

04:10.600 --> 04:14.920
Alright, let's say Dan, let's say you get a piano falls through the ceiling right now

04:14.920 --> 04:16.800
and crushes you and you die.

04:16.800 --> 04:22.080
Then I get to go, time freezes as I die and Gabriel comes down or if you prefer Allah

04:22.080 --> 04:32.240
or Giuseppe, whatever your religion is, if you're Muslim or Italian or if you're a fan

04:32.240 --> 04:37.440
of Half-Life, that snake guy comes out with a suit and the briefcase and goes, Mr. Gooden,

04:37.440 --> 04:46.520
good job, it seems the game is over, I expected a bigger response from my crowd for the Half-Life

04:46.520 --> 04:50.400
reference.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
What's his name?

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
G-Man, yeah.

04:52.400 --> 04:58.280
They freeze time and they go, whose pants would you like to shit in and then you get

04:58.280 --> 04:59.280
a brief dialogue.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.080
Wait, Vincent Price comes to you?

05:01.080 --> 05:05.840
Yeah, kind of, yeah, Vincent Price, that's about it, you get to choose the form of your

05:05.840 --> 05:06.840
shit accountant.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.840
This is getting better.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.840
Yeah, yeah, you get to choose, Gene Hackman comes out, good job, who's pants do you want

05:12.840 --> 05:17.560
to shit in, soldier, I got Gene Hackman, I would like to know more about this piano that

05:17.560 --> 05:21.800
fell on me, this good, good, good, I like your style, soldier.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.840
You move up and you see the guy that dropped the piano, I go, okay, why did he drop the

05:24.840 --> 05:25.840
piano?

05:25.840 --> 05:30.560
You get to spend, I don't know, you get a half hour or you get to move around with the camera,

05:30.560 --> 05:32.320
it's like the Half-Life source engineer.

05:32.320 --> 05:37.520
Does the person who poops their pants know that this is a ghost poop, know that this

05:37.520 --> 05:42.520
is, no, they don't, they don't, they don't, you never know, if you're walking, so there's

05:42.520 --> 05:46.120
people on this earth that are walking around and they're like, oh, man, I'm such a real

05:46.120 --> 05:55.640
estate mogul, who did that, fuck you, you don't know, but be nice tomorrow, motherfucker,

05:55.640 --> 05:56.640
be nice.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.160
You've revealed that you poop your pants a lot throughout the year, you're just going

05:59.160 --> 06:03.360
to think that you're a terrible person, no, no, come on, you're normally pooping, silly,

06:03.360 --> 06:08.920
that's dumb, it's not dumb, no, no, no, you have admitted that you poop your pants from

06:08.920 --> 06:09.920
time to time.

06:09.920 --> 06:14.440
But it always follows me going, I think I have a fart coming.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.440
This follows nothing.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.440
Oh, so you'll know.

06:16.440 --> 06:19.400
You're in line at the bank and then your pants are filled with shit.

06:19.400 --> 06:25.520
It doesn't come out of your butt, it suddenly teleports into your pants, you're about to

06:25.520 --> 06:31.280
cash a check and you have shit in my pants and everyone's going, what smells, who smells,

06:31.280 --> 06:33.120
what smells, oh, who's that guy?

06:33.120 --> 06:39.000
And you know, it's like a comment section, like, okay, maybe that person, maybe the person

06:39.000 --> 06:43.960
that pooped in his pants is crazy, maybe, given the benefit of the doubt, because if

06:43.960 --> 06:48.600
you don't, if you punish him too hard, if you go, hey, stinky, who'd you fuck over?

06:48.600 --> 06:53.980
He might shit in your pants when he dies, so keep a low profile, that's the natural

06:53.980 --> 06:57.160
effect it's going to have on our national psyche.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.600
One death, one shit, you get to poop in one person's pants.

06:59.600 --> 07:04.240
One solid fucking chunky poop in the pants of your choosing.

07:04.240 --> 07:09.960
All right, Dan, let's say God forbid you drop dead tonight, and who would I choose?

07:09.960 --> 07:11.880
Who's your poop accountant?

07:11.880 --> 07:15.200
Your poop, your poop meister?

07:15.200 --> 07:17.120
Just off the top of my head, Bruce Valanche.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.120
Bruce Valanche.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.960
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not who's pants do you poop in?

07:21.960 --> 07:22.960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry.

07:22.960 --> 07:23.960
First, who's your Gene Hackman?

07:23.960 --> 07:24.960
Who do you pick?

07:24.960 --> 07:25.960
Oh, oh, oh, who's my gozer?

07:25.960 --> 07:26.960
Yeah.

07:26.960 --> 07:27.960
Like my anti-gozer?

07:27.960 --> 07:28.960
Yeah.

07:28.960 --> 07:29.960
Top of your head.

07:29.960 --> 07:30.960
Top of your head.

07:30.960 --> 07:31.960
Noam Chomsky.

07:31.960 --> 07:32.960
Noam Chomsky.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.960
Noam Chomsky.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.960
No, he's alive.

07:36.960 --> 07:37.960
No, he's alive.

07:37.960 --> 07:38.960
They don't have to be dead.

07:38.960 --> 07:43.960
I'm going to, you know, fuck you, Juliet, I'm going to shit your pants when I die.

07:43.960 --> 07:50.960
All right, so Noam Chomsky comes out and says, taking time out of his trench into social

07:50.960 --> 07:56.800
commentaries, and you tell him you want to poop in Bruce Valanche's pants.

07:56.800 --> 07:57.800
Yeah.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.800
And I tell him why.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.680
And I get to, and he, no matter what, it's like contact, you know, Jody Foster's dad.

08:02.680 --> 08:06.560
Like, he's a projector, so no matter what, Noam Chomsky's not going to go, Dan, don't

08:06.560 --> 08:07.560
be petty.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.280
Noam Chomsky's going to go, you know what?

08:09.280 --> 08:16.280
I discovered language at MIT, and I'm the foremost dissenter of American foreign policy.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.920
Bruce Valanche, good choice, Dan.

08:17.920 --> 08:18.920
Yeah.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.400
And that's like, that's the joy you carry into the afterlife, into oblivion.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.920
But you can't leave a calling card.

08:24.920 --> 08:29.360
They don't know who's, I don't want them to, because that's the important thing.

08:29.360 --> 08:34.200
Because then you start, here's what, here's what, here's what, here's what, here's what,

08:34.200 --> 08:37.560
here's what, here's what Dick Cheney'll do.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.680
Here's what Dick Cheney'll do.

08:38.680 --> 08:43.080
He'll go to the Pentagon, he'll go in the basement and go, wah, wah, I need you to invent

08:43.080 --> 08:49.960
a device that flags all the shit coming into my pants and separates it, each name, if there's

08:49.960 --> 08:54.480
a name tag, I want you to track it, track it, and all their families go to Guantanamo.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.480
See?

08:55.480 --> 08:56.480
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.160
Like, I don't want any of that shit.

08:58.160 --> 09:02.320
I want him to just have shit in his pants, so the volume of it is a measure of people's

09:02.320 --> 09:03.320
anger against it.

09:03.320 --> 09:04.320
Yeah.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.320
That's it.

09:05.320 --> 09:06.880
Like, why is this, what the fuck did I do?

09:06.880 --> 09:11.800
I'll tell you what you did, motherfucker, you fucked around too much with too many people.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.720
You got too high on the radar.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.720
But Dan.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.720
Welcome to America.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.720
Okay, here, I have a, I found a-

09:17.720 --> 09:19.720
You got a bunch of shit in your pants.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.720
Clean it up.

09:20.720 --> 09:21.720
I have found-

09:21.720 --> 09:27.840
If you're going to be famous, be cool, be friendly, be nice, be Mother Teresa.

09:27.840 --> 09:31.640
If you're going to be famous, if you're going to be on a coffee cup, be on a coffee cup

09:31.640 --> 09:33.440
because you're the coolest person in the world.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.440
And then every once in a while, still, you'll be driving down Hollywood Boulevard, like,

09:36.440 --> 09:39.400
oh, okay, some 15-year-old asshole wanted to fuck with it.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.400
Okay, fine.

09:40.400 --> 09:46.160
Yeah, but aren't famous, you've read comment sections after an episode of a show that you've

09:46.160 --> 09:47.160
made.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.160
Yeah.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.160
People are petty.

09:49.160 --> 09:50.160
Well, I'm an asshole.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.160
Yeah.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.160
I am partially an asshole, you know?

09:52.160 --> 09:53.160
Like-

09:53.160 --> 09:55.160
How much, if this went into effect, how many-

09:55.160 --> 09:58.960
If it's consigned into law.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.040
Here's hoping it does.

10:02.040 --> 10:05.680
It seems like a long shot, but if it does go into effect-

10:05.680 --> 10:09.040
How many times do you think people are going to die and on their deathbed make you poop?

10:09.040 --> 10:13.040
Honestly, like, do you think there's thousands, hundreds, well, yeah, I don't know.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.040
Strangers?

10:14.040 --> 10:15.040
Yeah.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.040
Really?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.040
Well, no, no, no, that's not true because you only get one.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.040
You get one.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.040
So you get passed up, you know?

10:19.040 --> 10:20.520
Who's going to use it too ironically?

10:20.520 --> 10:21.520
Yeah.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.520
You know?

10:22.520 --> 10:23.520
Like, when I go-

10:23.520 --> 10:25.520
Yeah, first and foremost, by the way-

10:25.520 --> 10:26.520
Yeah, Kevin Smith.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.520
I'll tell you what.

10:27.520 --> 10:28.520
You know what?

10:28.520 --> 10:29.520
You know who's going to get the most?

10:29.520 --> 10:30.520
You.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.520
Because it's your idea.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.000
I don't get credit for the idea.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.760
I don't want that.

10:36.760 --> 10:37.760
That's not cool.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.200
You can't do that because then everyone's doing it.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.200
Because everyone-

10:40.200 --> 10:43.000
After I make this happen, everyone's going to resent the-

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.840
Like, you know, I don't suppose you've seen Highlander 2, but like-

10:47.840 --> 10:48.840
Yes?

10:48.840 --> 10:56.040
Conor McLeod invented a shield that protects the earth from the effects of the depleted

10:56.040 --> 11:03.520
ozone and everyone resents him because it's an eternal night and also there's Highlanders?

11:03.520 --> 11:04.520
It's 8.25.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.160
I could go on and on about it.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.160
You know what?

11:07.160 --> 11:08.160
Can I change my answer?

11:08.160 --> 11:12.600
I would shit in the pants of the director of Highlander 2.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.600
Not the writer.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.600
Can I split my shit?

11:14.600 --> 11:15.600
Can I split my shit?

11:15.600 --> 11:17.800
Can I put half on the writer's pants?

11:17.800 --> 11:20.600
All right, listen, we've got a litany, a litany.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
We have a list.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.600
Okay?

11:22.600 --> 11:23.600
We have a menu.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.600
Can we just move on?

11:24.600 --> 11:25.600
Sure.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.600
Okay.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.600
Jeff.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.600
Yeah.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.600
All right.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.600
I spent today.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.600
I changed my phone to Android.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.600
A couple-

11:32.600 --> 11:33.600
I just sent you a text, by the way.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.600
Oh, did you?

11:34.600 --> 11:35.600
Well, I had my volume down.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.600
Oh.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.600
So this is the-

11:37.600 --> 11:38.600
All right.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.600
Give me one second.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.600
Let me just explain.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.600
I just-

11:41.600 --> 11:42.600
This is the benefit of an Android phone as opposed to an iPhone.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.600
I'll resend that text.

11:43.600 --> 11:44.600
Yeah.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.600
I spent today pimping out my phone notification wise.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.600
Like, I downloaded different sounds and sent them, so send me a text first.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.600
Send me a text.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.600
Sending right now.

11:51.600 --> 11:58.000
Yeah, that was a Star Trek sound.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Yeah.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.200
All right, Jeff, can you send me an email?

12:00.200 --> 12:01.200
Would you read it?

12:01.200 --> 12:02.200
Would you read the text?

12:02.200 --> 12:03.200
All right.

12:03.200 --> 12:11.800
I, Dan Harmon, love dicks and balls on my head.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.600
That's not going to fool anybody.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.600
Yeah.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.600
They know I'm reading that.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.600
I'm sending you an email right now, too.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.600
Let's see.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.600
It's going to take a second to send that one.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.600
Oh, yeah.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.600
That might not register right away.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.600
Yeah.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.600
The email's different.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.600
Leave it on.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.600
Okay.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.600
It's the wheels returning here.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.600
I'll hold it up here.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.600
Okay.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.600
All right.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.600
So is that something you went online and got?

12:32.600 --> 12:33.600
The Star Trek sound effect?

12:33.600 --> 12:34.600
Yeah, because I-

12:34.600 --> 12:36.600
Yeah, because I can't, because I'm free.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.600
You know?

12:37.600 --> 12:39.600
I'm not a slave to Apple.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.600
That should have sent.

12:41.600 --> 12:42.600
Yeah.

12:42.600 --> 12:43.600
Okay.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.600
I'm just-

12:44.600 --> 12:45.600
Transformers?

12:45.600 --> 12:46.600
Transformers.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.600
Old school transformers.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.600
Awesome.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.600
From the center.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.600
All right.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.600
That's it.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.600
Okay.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.600
That's the next item on the list.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.600
You want to read the-

12:54.600 --> 12:55.600
We're shipping through the-

12:55.600 --> 12:56.600
You're not going to read the email that I sent you?

12:56.600 --> 12:57.600
All right.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.600
I'll read the email.

12:58.600 --> 12:59.600
That's kind of rude.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.600
All right.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.600
All right.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.600
All right.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.600
All right.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.600
All right.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.600
All right.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.600
All right.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.600
All right.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.600
All right.

13:08.600 --> 13:09.600
All right.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.600
All right.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.600
All right.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.600
All right.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.600
Oh!

13:13.600 --> 13:14.600
daylight, light.

13:14.600 --> 13:19.600
What the fuck good-

13:19.600 --> 13:22.600
I thought there was a rap beat.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.600
I'm sorry.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.600
I didn't-

13:24.600 --> 13:25.600
I didn't know what you were doing.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.180
It started like a rap beat.

13:27.180 --> 13:28.440
I was starting yeah like-

13:28.440 --> 13:32.600
Yeah, it was a Motown sample and then a rap beat was going to happen.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.600
All right.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
Just,

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
Should I have one?

13:35.600 --> 13:36.600
Should I have a rap beat input?

13:36.600 --> 13:37.600
I guess it should-

13:37.600 --> 13:38.600
Sure, always.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.600
Are you my friend?

13:39.600 --> 13:40.600
Yeah.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.600
Your answer's yes.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.360
Fair enough.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.080
Next on the list, next on the list.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.960
All right, Holly Berry, Burbank Eye.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.680
Okay, so there's a movie poster,

13:48.680 --> 13:49.880
I guess there's a movie coming out.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.520
It's Holly, Holly Berry's got a headset phone thing on,

13:53.520 --> 13:58.280
and underneath her face is a map of Los Angeles.

13:58.280 --> 14:01.640
And I saw it on a stoplight, it's on a bus stop,

14:01.640 --> 14:05.160
and I guess it's about a 911 dispatcher or something

14:05.160 --> 14:10.160
that says like, there are 1,800 911 calls every day

14:10.920 --> 14:12.040
in Los Angeles.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.600
This one got personal.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.640
And it's Holly Berry's face,

14:16.640 --> 14:19.480
and then underneath her face at half opacity

14:19.480 --> 14:21.240
is a map of Los Angeles.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.360
So you see like Santa Monica's by her lip,

14:23.360 --> 14:24.440
like a corner of her lip,

14:24.440 --> 14:25.800
but then like right under her eye,

14:25.800 --> 14:27.680
it's like Glendale Burbank.

14:27.680 --> 14:31.560
I don't know, to me, it undercut the severity of the,

14:31.560 --> 14:34.080
like Burbank, it's a Burbank Eye.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.680
Like the Burbank under her eye,

14:37.680 --> 14:40.200
your eye goes right to it, because it's her eye.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.240
Like, oh, hey pretty lady, Burbank.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.480
It's just a dumb town.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.840
I work in Burbank, but it's just a dumb like Burbank.

14:47.840 --> 14:51.480
Like, oh, hey, this one got personal Burbank Eye.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.400
It's kind of dumb.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.200
Same department, Superman poster.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.040
What's going on?

14:57.040 --> 14:58.280
I drove past the Warner Brothers lot.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.480
I saw a poster, it's Superman and handcuffs

15:00.480 --> 15:02.680
with people like cops behind them.

15:02.680 --> 15:03.840
Anybody, anybody?

15:03.840 --> 15:06.160
Somebody's got to know about this.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.680
So who called out what?

15:07.680 --> 15:08.880
Henry Cabot.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.360
Henry Cabot?

15:12.880 --> 15:14.520
Cabo?

15:14.520 --> 15:15.960
Cabo?

15:15.960 --> 15:18.320
I'm sorry, I don't, I just, this is all gibberish.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.840
Henry Cabot Lodge is playing Superman.

15:20.840 --> 15:24.920
Oh, oh, okay, is anyone kind of an Ain't It Cool

15:24.920 --> 15:27.360
like a newser that can give us the dope

15:27.360 --> 15:30.400
on the Superman movie that I'm seeing teased on this poster?

15:30.400 --> 15:31.640
Is there anybody here that's?

15:31.640 --> 15:32.640
I guess.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.680
Well, you know, you can't, yeah, I'm guessing, sir.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.800
I want anybody that actually knows the dope.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.040
Okay, I got a guy raising his,

15:39.040 --> 15:40.000
well, can you come up here?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.200
Cause the mic won't pick you up.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.840
If you're willing to, it's fine.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.320
What's your name?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.160
Jeremy, everybody.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.480
Welcome Jeremy to the stage.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.320
Hello.

15:49.320 --> 15:53.320
That's the, it's the new movie, Man of Steel,

15:53.320 --> 15:54.160
that they're working on.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.320
Right, it says Man of Steel.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.880
There's a very cool looking Superman.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.000
What's the actor's name?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.160
Henry Cabo.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.520
Henry Cabo.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.360
Cabo?

16:01.360 --> 16:02.200
Cabo?

16:02.200 --> 16:03.040
What's he from?

16:03.040 --> 16:03.880
Where the B?

16:03.880 --> 16:04.720
Cowbell?

16:04.720 --> 16:05.880
Where the B?

16:05.880 --> 16:06.720
The Cabo.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.560
Henry Cowbell.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.680
There you go.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.040
Cabo.

16:10.040 --> 16:10.880
Cabo.

16:10.880 --> 16:11.720
Got it.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.800
I gotta have more Cabo.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.040
That's so hack.

16:16.040 --> 16:16.880
So hack.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.560
I'm a hack.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.320
As your grandpa at Christmas, I'm asking you kids,

16:22.320 --> 16:24.680
why is Henry Cabo exciting?

16:24.680 --> 16:25.840
What was he in?

16:26.960 --> 16:27.960
Interiors?

16:27.960 --> 16:28.800
By Woody Allen?

16:28.800 --> 16:29.640
Immortals.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.480
Wow.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.960
Wow, he did great in that Woody Allen movie.

16:31.960 --> 16:32.800
Very...

16:32.800 --> 16:34.080
The Tudors.

16:34.080 --> 16:34.920
The Tudors.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.880
Okay, wow, we are...

16:36.880 --> 16:37.720
Wow.

16:37.720 --> 16:38.560
Immortals.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.720
Okay, Tudors and Immortals.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.080
Remember when it was just Harrison Ford

16:43.080 --> 16:43.920
and three other guys?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.040
Yeah.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.880
Now it's just like, the barrel is so much wider

16:47.880 --> 16:49.880
and the bottom can be scraped forever.

16:51.480 --> 16:52.320
All right.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.920
All right, Henry Cabo.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.960
So what do you know about the...

17:00.960 --> 17:03.200
So he has to...

17:03.200 --> 17:05.320
They find out that he's got powers

17:05.320 --> 17:07.040
because his dad's always like,

17:07.040 --> 17:09.160
don't show people your powers or...

17:10.160 --> 17:11.000
His dad?

17:11.000 --> 17:11.760
Yeah.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.360
Well, you know, that's Jeff, don't act.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.600
Jarell?

17:14.600 --> 17:17.880
No, his dad is an adoptive father, small though.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.040
So he...

17:22.000 --> 17:24.240
I will clear this courtroom.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.880
He goes to the authorities.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.120
He's like, I'm an alien.

17:27.120 --> 17:30.680
And they're like, well, we've got to process you.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.800
Oh, it's about alien immigration law?

17:33.800 --> 17:36.160
Yeah, well, they're like, he's older

17:36.160 --> 17:37.920
and he wants to...

17:37.920 --> 17:39.560
He's been hiding.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.680
He feels guilty about being...

17:40.680 --> 17:42.400
He's been on, like, Deadliest Catch Boat

17:42.400 --> 17:45.720
for, like, years, hiding the fact that he's Superman.

17:45.720 --> 17:48.360
It's a retelling, it's...

17:48.360 --> 17:49.200
It's a re...

17:49.200 --> 17:51.160
Yeah, does he fight crime in it?

17:51.160 --> 17:52.160
Eventually.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.320
Like on page 20 or page 60?

17:55.320 --> 17:56.320
Like, act two.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.320
Have you seen it?

17:57.320 --> 17:58.160
Is it out in theaters?

17:58.160 --> 17:59.000
How do you know?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.720
It's been really long trailers and it's been around.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.840
They've been talking about it for a while now.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.440
Are you excited about it?

18:05.440 --> 18:08.080
I'm gonna see it, because I like superhero movies, so...

18:08.080 --> 18:11.760
But are you a Superman guy or are you like Batman guy?

18:11.760 --> 18:12.960
90's Superman.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.240
I know a lot of...

18:14.240 --> 18:15.320
Like, what does that mean?

18:15.320 --> 18:16.160
Small though?

18:16.160 --> 18:18.040
90's to 2000.

18:18.040 --> 18:18.880
Comics.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.120
Oh, in the comic, they actually made Superman appealing?

18:22.120 --> 18:22.960
Yeah, yeah.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.640
You know what I just found out about Superman?

18:24.640 --> 18:26.400
I never understood the appeal of Superman.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.240
I never got it.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.000
Like, what does it mean?

18:29.000 --> 18:29.840
Do you have Batman?

18:29.840 --> 18:30.680
We have Spider-Man.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.520
You can see the appeal.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.560
Granted, all these things came after Superman.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.320
We developed the idea of a Superman.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.720
And then everything else is a commentary after that.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.320
It's like, if you watch Easy Rider and you don't like it,

18:40.320 --> 18:42.640
you can't necessarily say Easy Rider is a bad movie

18:42.640 --> 18:45.240
because so much shit was influenced by this weird...

18:45.240 --> 18:47.040
Dennis Hopper's high and he's got a camera.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.680
But it's Superman.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.040
I didn't know this about the history of it.

18:51.040 --> 18:55.880
It was created by two Jewish brothers, I think.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.080
And they were during the time when Jewish people

18:59.080 --> 19:02.760
were incredibly feeling like, what is wrong with us?

19:02.760 --> 19:05.320
Why does this keep happening?

19:05.320 --> 19:09.480
Should I start feeling bad about myself officially?

19:09.480 --> 19:11.880
And they created this character that was like,

19:11.880 --> 19:14.800
they should have put a little super hat on his head

19:14.800 --> 19:18.040
and had him be able to throw it and decapitate Nazis and stuff.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.440
Super Yarmulke?

19:19.440 --> 19:20.160
So that we could under...

19:20.160 --> 19:21.880
Because I never got it.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.160
But they were expressing...

19:24.160 --> 19:26.000
Maybe that is the...

19:26.000 --> 19:28.440
When we do keep Superman around,

19:28.440 --> 19:30.120
maybe we're all feeling that, like,

19:30.120 --> 19:32.400
that fuck you, you know, just that one impulse of like,

19:32.400 --> 19:35.200
fuck you, fuck you, like that.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.320
That makes me like him.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.480
Other than that, I'm like, what the fuck are you?

19:38.480 --> 19:40.880
Like, even in the movies, he loses his powers,

19:40.880 --> 19:41.880
he gets beat up in a truck stop,

19:41.880 --> 19:43.200
and then that whole movie is supposed to be

19:43.200 --> 19:44.720
the coolest Superman movie, and then he goes back

19:44.720 --> 19:46.840
and then he beats the shit out of a truck driver.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.840
The worst, like, to me growing up,

19:49.840 --> 19:51.840
lower middle class in Wisconsin,

19:51.840 --> 19:54.360
was like, Batman, I like, because my fantasy is,

19:54.360 --> 19:56.560
I want to be rich, and if I was rich,

19:56.560 --> 19:57.840
I wouldn't fuck around with my money.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.840
I'd use it to fight crime and word.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.120
Like, I would make a super car,

20:02.120 --> 20:03.200
and I'd have cameras everywhere,

20:03.200 --> 20:04.800
and I'd go out and I'd kick some ass.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.640
Like, green hornet?

20:05.640 --> 20:07.000
Yeah, yeah, sure.

20:07.000 --> 20:07.840
Yeah.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.200
And Spider-Man, too, is the same thing.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.120
Like, oh, you're a teenager, you find out you're talented,

20:12.120 --> 20:13.280
and then how do you deal with it?

20:13.280 --> 20:14.880
The answer is wisecracking, you know?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.840
Like, you get out there.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.200
But Superman was always like,

20:18.200 --> 20:19.760
oh, you're born special, boo-hoo.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.480
Like, jerk off in a cup, pour it on your head, you.

20:22.480 --> 20:27.480
That's his weakness.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.280
Oh, his own cum touches him,

20:30.280 --> 20:32.920
and he's like, oh, I'm my own worst enemy.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.080
Now, when you remind me where I'm from,

20:36.080 --> 20:38.280
I start to get weak.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.040
So dumb, it's just so dumb.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.960
But the Jew thing, like, really lifts it up.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.040
That's the dash of pepper that every omelet needs.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.600
Like, huh, this needs a little, like, gritty,

20:52.600 --> 20:56.440
like, fucking, yeah, there's a lot of human emotion there.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.000
Should have put that on the cover.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Superman, and then the subheading,

21:00.000 --> 21:03.280
like, an expression of Jewish rage.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.680
And then I'd be like, oh, shit, this is valuable.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.520
Like, that mouse comic.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.280
Like, go valuable, if I don't like this,

21:13.280 --> 21:14.880
I'm a bad person, you know?

21:14.880 --> 21:17.520
Like, this is important culturally.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.680
Sorry, what was your name, Vest?

21:18.680 --> 21:19.520
Jeremy.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.720
Jeremy.

21:20.720 --> 21:21.960
He's wearing a vest.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.160
I don't know why I said that, it's stupid.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.520
All right, I got a lot of shit to get through.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.520
Stay there, stay there, Jeremy.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.680
You're gonna help me.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.680
Holly Berry, Burbank Eye, Superman, Poster.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.280
All right, all right, actually.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.320
The trailer for that movie, by the way.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.720
You don't watch The Bachelor, do you?

21:38.720 --> 21:39.560
No.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.080
Okay, well, the guy dumped the girl

21:41.080 --> 21:42.280
with one arm, apparently.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.000
If you're not caught up, sorry.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.080
Yeah, I guess it's a spoiler.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.480
Dan, aren't you supposed to be writing scripts right now

21:51.480 --> 21:53.160
for various networks?

21:53.160 --> 21:55.880
Well, I'm on a fucking stage, what are you talking about?

21:55.880 --> 21:58.680
Oh, I was just watching a lot of TV, man, you gotta.

21:58.680 --> 21:59.720
Oh, no, no, Erin tells me.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.400
Erin opens the window and I'm in the backyard

22:01.400 --> 22:02.600
writing my thing and she goes,

22:02.600 --> 22:04.720
he's dumping the girl with one arm.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.040
Get in here.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.080
She's right to do that.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.480
It's like, this is history, how do you do that?

22:11.480 --> 22:13.800
How do you dump a one-armed girl?

22:13.800 --> 22:16.680
They should have called The Bachelor this season.

22:16.680 --> 22:20.760
The Bachelor, season 25, how do you dump a one-armed girl?

22:22.200 --> 22:23.320
It's a good question.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.560
Again, like the Superman thing.

22:25.560 --> 22:29.240
Come clean about what's really powering your myth, you know?

22:30.840 --> 22:32.440
All I'm seeing is a guy in a cape,

22:32.440 --> 22:34.120
jumping around, he can do anything.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.720
Tell me it's about being a Jew.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.640
You're a complicated fellow, Dan.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.920
All right, okay, wait, Alex?

22:42.920 --> 22:43.760
Jeremy.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.840
Christ.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.360
No, wait, watch this, Jeff, watch this.

22:51.360 --> 22:52.240
Should I get a name tag?

22:52.240 --> 22:54.400
If you wanted to be named anything, what would it be?

22:55.200 --> 22:56.640
Well, I like my name, so.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.320
Ah, shit.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.600
I just thought maybe, all right.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.800
Sometimes I feel like when I do that, God's working through me.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.240
Jeremy?

23:04.240 --> 23:05.440
That sometimes is just bad with names.

23:05.440 --> 23:08.240
Jeremy, the ghost poop law is an effect.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.240
Who's passed you poop?

23:10.240 --> 23:11.840
Who's passed you poop if you drop dead to me?

23:11.840 --> 23:14.080
Uh, one of the high school bullies.

23:14.080 --> 23:14.880
Really?

23:14.880 --> 23:15.440
What's his name?

23:15.440 --> 23:15.920
What's his name?

23:15.920 --> 23:19.200
Uh, I'd have to narrow it down for that.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.360
Oh, just what you have to.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.240
You're dying.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.440
Gene Hackman's asking you.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.720
First of all, who is your poop mentor?

23:26.720 --> 23:28.400
My poop mentor?

23:28.400 --> 23:29.600
Yeah, who's your Gene Hackman?

23:29.600 --> 23:30.800
Who's your young child?

23:30.800 --> 23:31.600
Christopher Walken.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.560
Christopher Walken comes with us.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.000
Christopher Walken comes down.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.520
And Jeff, he says what?

23:37.520 --> 23:42.400
He says, hi, you're dead.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.560
Sorry, you're so young.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.520
Nice vest.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.000
Have you seen that Superman movie?

23:59.360 --> 24:00.880
I gotta have more cavill.

24:00.880 --> 24:05.760
Oh, sorry, that's even hack for me.

24:08.080 --> 24:08.960
Who do you want to poop?

24:11.360 --> 24:12.400
Who are you going to poop?

24:12.400 --> 24:17.600
Yeah, whose pants do you want to fill with poo?

24:19.840 --> 24:20.400
It's your right.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.280
It's a dead person.

24:24.320 --> 24:24.880
Tick tock.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.480
I'm a pretty popular poop mentor.

24:28.480 --> 24:32.000
But also, you have 10 minutes to ask Christopher Walken anything.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.080
Ask him any question you want.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.040
Put on the spot.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.080
It'd be so difficult.

24:40.080 --> 24:40.560
It's all right.

24:41.520 --> 24:41.840
Yeah.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.840
Are you of legal drinking age?

24:43.840 --> 24:44.400
Oh, yeah.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.360
Do you want a vodka?

24:45.360 --> 24:45.760
There you go.

24:45.760 --> 24:46.720
That's your prize for coming up.

24:46.720 --> 24:46.880
Cool.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.240
Come on.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.200
Jeremy, whose pants do you poop?

24:49.200 --> 24:49.600
Oh, let's see.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.200
We got a lot of shit to get through the show.

24:55.200 --> 24:55.200
Chris.

24:55.200 --> 24:55.760
Chris.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.160
Huh?

24:56.160 --> 24:56.720
Chris.

24:56.720 --> 24:57.280
Chris.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.480
He's a high school bully?

24:58.480 --> 24:59.120
He was.

24:59.120 --> 24:59.440
Right?

24:59.440 --> 25:00.080
Not anymore.

25:00.080 --> 25:00.640
That would be weird.

25:00.640 --> 25:01.920
What did you tell us specifically?

25:01.920 --> 25:03.120
What's your memory of Chris?

25:03.120 --> 25:03.760
What did he do to you?

25:05.440 --> 25:08.160
Well, one of the, actually, no, I switch it.

25:08.160 --> 25:08.960
Justin.

25:09.840 --> 25:10.640
Justin Thomas.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.720
You can bleep that out.

25:14.720 --> 25:15.520
He's time out.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.000
Justin Thomas.

25:18.000 --> 25:18.480
What did he do?

25:18.480 --> 25:18.960
What did he do?

25:20.320 --> 25:21.040
One memory.

25:21.040 --> 25:24.560
Regular, weekly, he would, if I had to leave the classroom,

25:24.560 --> 25:26.560
he would flip my bag inside out.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.160
What does that mean?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.080
Like a book bag or a backpack?

25:30.080 --> 25:31.040
Yeah, take your book bag.

25:31.040 --> 25:34.320
It's a weird thing that they figured out how to do,

25:34.320 --> 25:36.960
is they take your book bag and they empty it,

25:36.960 --> 25:38.240
and then they turn it inside out

25:38.240 --> 25:39.920
and put all your stuff back in,

25:39.920 --> 25:41.680
except I always had a lot of stuff,

25:41.680 --> 25:44.400
like papers and whatever in my bag.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.720
So the first time he tried it,

25:46.720 --> 25:48.480
he just, he didn't bother putting it all back in.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.200
Right, of course not.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.560
He flipped it inside out and he was like,

25:50.560 --> 25:54.720
oh, this is a lot more work than I'm signing on to work.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.520
So then what happens?

25:55.520 --> 25:56.960
You got an inside out book bag?

25:56.960 --> 25:58.720
Yeah, it's like it's zipped up shut

25:58.720 --> 25:59.680
with all your stuff in it,

25:59.680 --> 26:02.160
so then you have to then undo it

26:02.160 --> 26:04.000
and put your all stuff back in.

26:04.000 --> 26:04.880
Right, so yeah.

26:04.880 --> 26:05.600
Regularly.

26:05.600 --> 26:06.320
Did he ever, like,

26:06.320 --> 26:07.360
did he ever get beat up or anything?

26:08.240 --> 26:09.600
He attempted it once,

26:09.600 --> 26:11.520
and then he didn't try that anymore.

26:13.280 --> 26:13.760
Uh-oh.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.760
Well, what, what, what?

26:16.960 --> 26:19.600
Most people don't like lunchboxes going at their head.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.520
You hit him with a lunchbox?

26:21.520 --> 26:25.760
So it sounds like you, you had a pretty easy experience.

26:25.760 --> 26:26.240
Eventually.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.240
So it almost sounds like you're a bully.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.040
Eventually.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.040
It sounds like Justin Thomas

26:31.040 --> 26:32.480
is going to shit your pants when he does.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.560
I'm sure he's got a lot more people to deal with.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.680
Probably, yeah.

26:37.680 --> 26:38.800
So it was just, it was torment.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.840
It was, it was just that, yeah.

26:39.840 --> 26:44.000
Yeah, it was like just constant like annoying stuff.

26:44.880 --> 26:45.680
Was he a big guy?

26:45.680 --> 26:46.320
Was he a?

26:46.320 --> 26:47.680
No, that was probably why.

26:47.680 --> 26:48.160
Oh, of course.

26:48.160 --> 26:48.640
Yeah.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.680
Yeah, the little guys were the worst.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.400
Yeah.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.920
Like they were, they were, they were big guys

26:51.920 --> 26:52.880
who were abusing their authority,

26:52.880 --> 26:54.080
but then you, you, you would go,

26:54.080 --> 26:56.400
clean me alone and they'd go, you're all late.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.200
Yeah.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.480
Dumb, dumb.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.480
Fucking all, all assholes, all of you.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.120
But then the little guy would be like,

27:03.120 --> 27:05.600
yeah, he's the guy who's going to bring an exacto blade

27:05.600 --> 27:07.200
to school as a fucking little guy.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.320
This is dead, burned him with a cigarette,

27:10.320 --> 27:12.000
and your problem all of a sudden.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.000
This is the worst.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.080
But you know, the great thing is,

27:16.080 --> 27:17.440
you go to your tenure reunion,

27:17.440 --> 27:20.480
all of those guys just like drank antifreeze and died.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.840
I went to my 20 year reunion.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.760
If you wait, if you make it that far,

27:25.760 --> 27:27.760
they all blow each other up in cars

27:27.760 --> 27:29.120
and like go to prison and stuff.

27:29.120 --> 27:32.160
Like, well, whatever happened to the five assholes

27:32.160 --> 27:33.360
that I hated the most?

27:33.360 --> 27:34.800
Oh, two of them went to prison,

27:34.800 --> 27:36.000
three of them ratted on each other,

27:36.000 --> 27:37.920
and then one of them got out and blew the other one up.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.680
Like, like, it's just great.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.440
You just, so I don't have to do anything.

27:41.440 --> 27:42.880
Like there is no revenge fantasy.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.000
Like they just kill each other,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.320
like bacteria in your teeth or something.

27:46.320 --> 27:50.160
All right, thank you, Alex, John, whatever your name is.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.040
Jeremy, everyone.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.160
Thanks for opening up.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.920
Boy, it sounds like that's Superman movies.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.320
Now the jury's out.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.880
Let's check back in with that Superman movie in a week

28:04.880 --> 28:07.120
after we, let's get some more things.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.720
All right, next item on our list.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.560
You're familiar with Adam Goldberg, right?

28:11.600 --> 28:12.400
Slightly, yeah.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.480
Yeah, yeah, somebody in the front row just went,

28:14.480 --> 28:17.200
God damn it, like, oh, it's Adam, okay.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.120
Wait, I don't see Adam in the front row.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.240
Oh, there he is, okay.

28:20.240 --> 28:24.720
All right, so Goldberg, one of his moves,

28:24.720 --> 28:26.800
he gives you things, and then he asks for him back.

28:26.800 --> 28:27.920
Like he gives you a plate of brownies,

28:27.920 --> 28:28.880
and he goes, I want the plate back.

28:30.960 --> 28:31.920
This is my speculation.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.280
He read about it in some book about,

28:34.320 --> 28:36.160
Joe Rogan's guy getting laid or something.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.640
Give him something.

28:40.640 --> 28:41.840
Here's a t-shirt, and then you got,

28:41.840 --> 28:44.480
it's like the old gag of like,

28:44.480 --> 28:46.080
the old 80s sexist gag of like,

28:46.080 --> 28:47.360
oh, they'll leave a purse at your house,

28:47.360 --> 28:49.360
like on the woman's side, like, oh.

28:49.360 --> 28:52.400
So give him a thing, like, oh, is there a handkerchief?

28:52.400 --> 28:53.600
Hey, can I get that handkerchief back

28:53.600 --> 28:56.080
so I can talk to you and dig my paws into you,

28:56.080 --> 28:57.520
like just for a second?

28:57.520 --> 29:01.920
So Goldberg gave me a box of a game called Citadel's.

29:01.920 --> 29:04.400
It's like a role-playing game of some kind,

29:04.400 --> 29:05.520
some kind of thing.

29:05.520 --> 29:08.080
And I have it here, I'm gonna give it back to him.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.840
That's it, we'll just knock it off our list.

29:09.840 --> 29:14.000
Okay. Adam, could you please come up and receive your,

29:16.560 --> 29:17.440
we'll edit this out.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.640
So now you're gonna come up and you're gonna,

29:21.600 --> 29:23.440
this is kind of like you breaking up with a one-arm lady.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.560
This is reverse psychology back at you.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.760
You got the mic.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.760
Adam, here's your box of Citadel's.

29:31.760 --> 29:32.960
Thank you, have a great week.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.160
Adam Goldberg, everybody.

29:36.160 --> 29:41.920
All right, shed no tears for him.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.560
All right, moving down the list.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.240
All right, apparently.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.120
You're getting good at this, man.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.760
My phone gets bigger and bigger and I can keep a longer list.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.880
And yeah, I texted you earlier, you're at a bar.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.360
And I texted you, so we're at the pikey before the show.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.320
I said, order me a Sam Smith logo and a Frenette Bronco.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.040
And I'm walking up and I get there.

30:03.040 --> 30:03.760
I said, did you order?

30:03.760 --> 30:08.640
He's like, no, his giant 11 by nine phone is on the bar,

30:08.640 --> 30:11.520
on the table in front of him and still nothing.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.440
I was probably talking to somebody or something about,

30:13.440 --> 30:14.480
you know, I don't know who knows.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.280
Is BJ here?

30:18.560 --> 30:19.040
BJ?

30:19.760 --> 30:20.880
Okay, I have his phone, sorry.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.080
All right, knock that off the list.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.040
Are you just breaking up with everybody now?

30:25.040 --> 30:26.960
Yeah, I'm making amends, Jeff.

30:26.960 --> 30:29.440
Why don't they, why don't you tonight show I walk off stage

30:29.440 --> 30:31.440
and then you just hear a single gunshot and then it's like,

30:31.440 --> 30:34.720
it's like, it's the most amazing show.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.760
And then, and then all of a sudden I, oh,

30:37.760 --> 30:39.200
shit, there's a pants a full of poop.

30:40.640 --> 30:41.760
You son of a bitch.

30:41.760 --> 30:44.240
And then, and then Adam goes through his pile of poop

30:44.240 --> 30:45.680
and he pulls out the five of diamonds.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.000
Is this your car?

30:50.240 --> 30:52.080
All right, bachelor, one arm girl.

30:52.080 --> 30:53.760
All right, Ryan Ridley couldn't be here tonight.

30:53.760 --> 30:54.800
He's on a date tonight.

30:54.800 --> 31:00.480
I want to, I want to bring a company episode.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.040
I want to, I want to, I want to,

31:03.040 --> 31:04.320
I want to bring him up next week

31:04.320 --> 31:05.840
because I want to ask him how this date was.

31:05.840 --> 31:06.560
That's not cool.

31:07.200 --> 31:07.760
What do you mean?

31:07.760 --> 31:08.240
I don't know.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.600
It's personal shit, man.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.720
All right, bring him up, bring him up.

31:12.720 --> 31:13.520
No, he's not here.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.360
Next week, let's see.

31:15.360 --> 31:19.040
Tonight's date is, he's going on a date with a girl who.

31:19.040 --> 31:19.760
Is that big news?

31:19.760 --> 31:21.360
Is he kind of unlucky with the ladies?

31:21.360 --> 31:22.240
It's big news for him.

31:22.240 --> 31:22.640
Yeah, yeah.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.400
Well, no, he's an active dater.

31:24.400 --> 31:27.680
He dates, he dates more than I ever have.

31:27.680 --> 31:28.400
Yeah, he dates.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.520
He's part of the single scene.

31:31.040 --> 31:35.600
He's going on a date tonight with a girl that she said

31:35.600 --> 31:37.280
that they were trying to decide

31:37.280 --> 31:38.480
what to do for their first date.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.280
And she said, I want to infiltrate a cult.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.640
And I immediately like kind of came down

31:46.640 --> 31:50.800
and I was like, manic pixie dream girl kind of thing.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.440
Like, you know, Amelie, like, I don't know.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.480
Just go, let's have fun.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.880
Let's have a hell of a bottom Carter face fight club.

31:56.880 --> 32:00.320
You know, like, let's go, let's go wreak havoc.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.000
It's like, like, does she understand?

32:02.000 --> 32:03.600
Like, like, like my first date with Aaron,

32:04.720 --> 32:07.440
we had a drink at 11 a.m. at the drawing room.

32:07.440 --> 32:08.240
That's why I love her.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.200
I'm going to be with her forever.

32:09.200 --> 32:11.040
Because it's like, you're sitting there, you have a drink.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.640
Like, guess what?

32:12.640 --> 32:14.320
Being in love with him, he's going to be like, you know?

32:15.840 --> 32:16.480
You like this?

32:16.480 --> 32:19.840
Welcome to 20 years, you know?

32:19.840 --> 32:21.120
Like, like, that's, that's me.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.360
I'm 40, but Ryan's still out there playing the field.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.200
So it's like, let's go, you know, what I want to do?

32:25.200 --> 32:27.200
I'm going to take a pumpkin and sell it to a gourd.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.800
Let's just, let's, let's culture jam.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.000
Let's go to a laundromat, take the clothes.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
If we're put on our head, this guy comes in.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.480
It's like, let's, let's, let's, let's have no cameras there,

32:38.480 --> 32:41.200
but, but be punked, you know, like a punk people.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.880
And it would be Tom Green and a cult would be an awesome thing

32:44.880 --> 32:46.880
if the poop thing happened, because you could get a bunch

32:46.880 --> 32:48.880
of people to all poop the same guy's pants.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.880
Yeah, you could, like, yeah.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.880
The yogic flyers, like hovering over L.A.

32:52.880 --> 32:56.880
Focused the poop, like the real genius laser,

32:56.880 --> 33:00.880
you just target things, remote viewing poop people.

33:00.880 --> 33:04.880
The president was unable to sign the anti-poverty bill today,

33:04.880 --> 33:06.880
because so much poop was in his pants

33:06.880 --> 33:08.880
that he couldn't reach the pan.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.880
Yeah, what, what happens?

33:10.880 --> 33:12.880
What happens if you're an unpopular president,

33:12.880 --> 33:14.880
a bunch of people die in an unpopular war,

33:14.880 --> 33:17.880
and is it one shit after the other,

33:17.880 --> 33:21.880
or does it just compound, like, if 400 people die in a bomb,

33:21.880 --> 33:24.880
in a building, and that exploded because of,

33:24.880 --> 33:26.880
because of some sort of policy,

33:26.880 --> 33:28.880
and they all pooped the president's pants,

33:28.880 --> 33:30.880
is it 400 turds at once?

33:30.880 --> 33:31.880
Yes, yes, yes.

33:31.880 --> 33:32.880
So it's just shit everywhere.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.880
So everyone, so yes, so when you go to the White House,

33:35.880 --> 33:38.880
all you see is a giant pile of shit, always.

33:38.880 --> 33:39.880
Right.

33:39.880 --> 33:42.880
Like, you don't even see the White House unless

33:42.880 --> 33:44.880
the government starts shaping up,

33:44.880 --> 33:46.880
and starts representing the people so well,

33:46.880 --> 33:49.880
that their poop doesn't, like, eclipse the ivory, like...

33:49.880 --> 33:51.880
But nobody, nobody would run for president,

33:51.880 --> 33:52.880
because even if you won, and like...

33:52.880 --> 33:54.880
Exactly, exactly.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.880
No one would run for president,

33:56.880 --> 33:59.880
because it's a thankless, shitty job,

33:59.880 --> 34:01.880
because it's supposed to be,

34:01.880 --> 34:03.880
because you're running everything,

34:03.880 --> 34:05.880
because you make the trains run on time,

34:05.880 --> 34:07.880
you make sure everyone's happy,

34:07.880 --> 34:09.880
unless you have a passion for doing that,

34:09.880 --> 34:11.880
or a passion for sitting in a lot of people's shit.

34:11.880 --> 34:15.880
Well, I, yeah, I guess maybe the, the random oddball,

34:15.880 --> 34:17.880
it'd be like, for me,

34:17.880 --> 34:20.880
I'm probably gonna do a lot wrong.

34:20.880 --> 34:26.880
Like, I know, I know you, Turdy McGee.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.880
Like, there's only so many of those.

34:28.880 --> 34:29.880
All right.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.880
Like, I'm from the hustler party.

34:31.880 --> 34:34.880
I love, I love swimming in poop.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.880
But other than that, you'd be like,

34:36.880 --> 34:38.880
you know, you'd have, like, civil servant types going,

34:38.880 --> 34:39.880
like, look, I get it.

34:39.880 --> 34:40.880
You're gonna poop on me.

34:40.880 --> 34:41.880
You're gonna poop in my pants.

34:41.880 --> 34:42.880
It's gonna get, every day,

34:42.880 --> 34:44.880
they're gonna have to deal with this poop everywhere.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.880
And I'm gonna be surrounded by people

34:46.880 --> 34:48.880
who have to deal with the stench of poop.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.880
Like, when they come in, it's not a glamorous job.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.880
If you want power, and you want romance,

34:52.880 --> 34:55.880
you don't get into politics that way.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.880
That, that you keep all of those people,

34:57.880 --> 35:00.880
all those shitty people out of the business,

35:00.880 --> 35:02.880
by making it an actual shitty business.

35:02.880 --> 35:03.880
All of those people, then,

35:03.880 --> 35:05.880
they go into, like, model railroads or something.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.880
All of a sudden, it just deflects into, like,

35:07.880 --> 35:10.880
model railroads become, like, a billion-dollar industry.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.880
If you can make a perfect little train,

35:12.880 --> 35:15.880
like, let that, let all the hobby shops be powerful.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.880
And, like, let there be lines outside of it,

35:17.880 --> 35:18.880
and people are just, like, swaggering,

35:18.880 --> 35:19.880
like, oh, you wanna get in this hobby shop,

35:19.880 --> 35:20.880
and no one can figure it out.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.880
Like, like, like, like, let it be pointlessly pointful,

35:23.880 --> 35:25.880
you know, like, like, outside of it, like, fuck that.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.880
And then the actual places where you're running the government

35:27.880 --> 35:29.880
are, like, like, people are just trying

35:29.880 --> 35:31.880
to keep the level of shit down

35:31.880 --> 35:34.880
by not fucking up everything all the time.

35:34.880 --> 35:36.880
It's just a working theory, Jeff.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.880
It hinges on this weird spiritual teleportation of shit thing,

35:40.880 --> 35:42.880
and also, like, an afterlife and kind of thing.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.880
But there might be a way to, like, replicate the effect

35:45.880 --> 35:47.880
with, like, holograms, or...

35:47.880 --> 35:49.880
It's just something to keep in mind

35:49.880 --> 35:51.880
when we start our moon base on the moon.

35:51.880 --> 35:52.880
Bring it back to the...

35:52.880 --> 35:54.880
To our lost thesis.

35:54.880 --> 35:55.880
Yeah.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.880
I don't know how you got me on that topic,

35:57.880 --> 35:58.880
but that was Ryan Really's date.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.880
We got three things left, okay?

36:00.880 --> 36:01.880
All right.

36:01.880 --> 36:02.880
No, two things.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.880
I jerked off today at work.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.880
Wait.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.880
Your office is nothing but glass.

36:10.880 --> 36:11.880
It's all windows.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.880
Yeah, it's a secret bathroom.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.880
I had to...

36:15.880 --> 36:17.880
I'm telling you and Aaron at the same time,

36:17.880 --> 36:18.880
because I...

36:18.880 --> 36:21.880
But I have to stay on the same page

36:21.880 --> 36:22.880
and stay transparent about it,

36:22.880 --> 36:24.880
because I had, like, three weeks ago,

36:24.880 --> 36:27.880
if you recall, I stopped

36:27.880 --> 36:29.880
because it was getting in the way of my work.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.880
This was your first masturbation after the...

36:31.880 --> 36:32.880
Yeah, yeah.

36:32.880 --> 36:33.880
I had...

36:33.880 --> 36:35.880
Here's the thing, like, last couple days,

36:35.880 --> 36:36.880
like, I...

36:36.880 --> 36:37.880
You didn't masturbate for three weeks?

36:37.880 --> 36:38.880
Yeah.

36:38.880 --> 36:39.880
Oh, that's wrong.

36:39.880 --> 36:40.880
Hang on.

36:40.880 --> 36:41.880
You're welcome.

36:41.880 --> 36:42.880
Thank you, everybody.

36:42.880 --> 36:43.880
Thank you.

36:43.880 --> 36:44.880
And you're welcome.

36:44.880 --> 36:45.880
So that must have been a doozy.

36:45.880 --> 36:46.880
I did it.

36:46.880 --> 36:47.880
Not really, no?

36:47.880 --> 36:48.880
That's the weird thing.

36:48.880 --> 36:49.880
It wasn't like,

36:49.880 --> 36:50.880
Oh, Hoover Dam!

36:50.880 --> 36:52.880
It wasn't...

36:52.880 --> 36:53.880
It was kind of like what...

36:53.880 --> 36:54.880
It was like sneezing or something.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.880
It was like,

36:55.880 --> 36:56.880
All right.

36:56.880 --> 36:57.880
And that's why I had to do it,

36:57.880 --> 36:58.880
because I felt like...

36:58.880 --> 37:00.880
I kind of felt like a weird...

37:00.880 --> 37:01.880
It wasn't like...

37:01.880 --> 37:02.880
Like, you know,

37:02.880 --> 37:03.880
you're doing it eight times a day.

37:03.880 --> 37:04.880
It's like a weird compulsive thing.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.880
Like, you're addicted to the dopamine in your brain

37:06.880 --> 37:07.880
that's generated by,

37:07.880 --> 37:08.880
Oh, this is my comfort.

37:08.880 --> 37:09.880
This is like eating macaroni and cheese.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.880
It's a different thing

37:11.880 --> 37:13.880
than when you're like...

37:13.880 --> 37:14.880
Like, finally you're like,

37:14.880 --> 37:18.880
I feel like I have a bag of concrete in my pants.

37:18.880 --> 37:19.880
And I just...

37:19.880 --> 37:21.880
Just go into the bathroom.

37:21.880 --> 37:22.880
You know?

37:22.880 --> 37:23.880
I don't know.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.880
I'm learning the same time as you are.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.880
You made that a lot less sexy than it could have been.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.880
It's not...

37:30.880 --> 37:32.880
It's not a sexy thing.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.880
But I'm confessing I ended my three-week streak.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.880
But it was a biological imperative.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.880
I felt like I was going to get prostate cancer.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.880
Because I hadn't...

37:42.880 --> 37:44.880
You know, Aaron had been kind of sidelined

37:44.880 --> 37:45.880
for the last three days,

37:45.880 --> 37:47.880
because I'm working really hard to finish the script.

37:47.880 --> 37:48.880
And so I was like,

37:48.880 --> 37:49.880
I'm staying up all night,

37:49.880 --> 37:50.880
and then I'm going to bed.

37:50.880 --> 37:51.880
I'm exhausted.

37:51.880 --> 37:54.880
So the end result of that was like three days of...

37:54.880 --> 37:56.880
I'm not doing anything.

37:56.880 --> 37:57.880
And then I'm sitting at the office today.

37:57.880 --> 38:00.880
I'm like, I think I'm going to get cancer from...

38:00.880 --> 38:01.880
Which is an urban legend,

38:01.880 --> 38:03.880
but also I couldn't stop thinking about it.

38:03.880 --> 38:04.880
And I was like, I feel...

38:04.880 --> 38:06.880
I'm in pain.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.880
I'm just going to go and...

38:08.880 --> 38:10.880
You might have saved your own life.

38:10.880 --> 38:11.880
Yeah.

38:11.880 --> 38:12.880
So I did it,

38:12.880 --> 38:13.880
and I apologize, America,

38:13.880 --> 38:15.880
but I'm right back on the wagon.

38:15.880 --> 38:16.880
That's like...

38:16.880 --> 38:17.880
I'm sorry.

38:17.880 --> 38:18.880
That's your update.

38:18.880 --> 38:19.880
All right.

38:19.880 --> 38:20.880
Last thing on the list.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.880
Last thing.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.880
Real Abbot's here again.

38:22.880 --> 38:23.880
Oh, yeah.

38:23.880 --> 38:28.880
This is a smattering of applause.

38:28.880 --> 38:32.880
But an enthusiastic small portion of our crowd.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.880
Seven people really were into that.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.880
I saw him in the green room.

38:38.880 --> 38:39.880
I saw him in the green room,

38:39.880 --> 38:42.880
and he had a little brown paper bag,

38:42.880 --> 38:46.880
which I wanted to start a new segment called,

38:46.880 --> 38:48.880
What Did Abbot Buy at the Comic Book Store?

38:48.880 --> 38:49.880
All right.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.880
So let's bring up Real Abbot.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.880
Abbot Gaith.

38:57.880 --> 38:58.880
Abbot Gaith, everyone.

38:58.880 --> 38:59.880
Hello.

38:59.880 --> 39:00.880
How are you, man?

39:00.880 --> 39:01.880
Good to see you.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.880
Hey, man.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.880
No, first of all, last week was super fun.

39:06.880 --> 39:07.880
It was like really fun.

39:07.880 --> 39:10.880
When's the last time you jerked off, Abbot?

39:10.880 --> 39:12.880
Like two days ago, maybe.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.880
See, I can't jerk off either, actually,

39:14.880 --> 39:16.880
because I live with my brother now,

39:16.880 --> 39:19.880
and if I jerked off in the same house as him,

39:19.880 --> 39:20.880
right, it's weird.

39:20.880 --> 39:21.880
It's a sin, right?

39:21.880 --> 39:22.880
Well, it's just weird.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.880
It's kind of like, you need to be alone.

39:24.880 --> 39:25.880
What if you jerk off,

39:25.880 --> 39:26.880
and there's a room full of animators

39:26.880 --> 39:27.880
outside the bathroom door?

39:27.880 --> 39:28.880
That's even worse.

39:28.880 --> 39:29.880
Oh, OK.

39:29.880 --> 39:30.880
That's worse.

39:30.880 --> 39:33.880
Although I have jerked off at work before in the past,

39:33.880 --> 39:35.880
and it's only because at the time,

39:35.880 --> 39:36.880
I can't remember, like you said,

39:36.880 --> 39:37.880
like you felt you had cancer.

39:37.880 --> 39:38.880
I was like, something's wrong with me.

39:38.880 --> 39:39.880
I got it, yeah.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.880
And it's not even that joyful.

39:41.880 --> 39:42.880
It's kind of like,

39:42.880 --> 39:43.880
Yeah, it's like you have to do it.

39:43.880 --> 39:44.880
If I had waited one more day,

39:44.880 --> 39:46.880
I might have had one of those legendary wet dreams

39:46.880 --> 39:49.880
they taught us about in our 1950s-inspired

39:49.880 --> 39:51.880
1980s sex ed classes.

39:51.880 --> 39:52.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:52.880 --> 39:53.880
I had to tell you about wet dreams,

39:53.880 --> 39:56.880
and everyone in the 80s would be like,

39:56.880 --> 39:57.880
Wet dreams?

39:57.880 --> 39:58.880
Well, how does that happen?

39:58.880 --> 40:00.880
But it was like, they only knew wet dreams existed

40:00.880 --> 40:01.880
because in the 50s,

40:01.880 --> 40:03.880
people actually didn't jerk off for a while.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.880
I thought wet dreams was like,

40:05.880 --> 40:06.880
when you just piss your pants.

40:06.880 --> 40:07.880
No.

40:07.880 --> 40:08.880
That's what I thought as a kid.

40:08.880 --> 40:12.880
And then later found out it was like the other thing, yeah.

40:12.880 --> 40:13.880
And I was really disturbed.

40:13.880 --> 40:14.880
I was like, whoa.

40:14.880 --> 40:15.880
I've never had a wet dream.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.880
I don't think I ever, either.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.880
I've had very, very...

40:19.880 --> 40:21.880
Is this like an accidental jerk off?

40:21.880 --> 40:22.880
Is that what happens?

40:22.880 --> 40:23.880
Yeah, it's a nocturnal emission.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.880
It's like you just come in your dream.

40:25.880 --> 40:26.880
Well, do you like rub against something,

40:26.880 --> 40:27.880
or is it just like...

40:27.880 --> 40:28.880
I think you probably...

40:28.880 --> 40:29.880
Your dream makes you go like,

40:29.880 --> 40:30.880
oh!

40:30.880 --> 40:31.880
And then like you have a...

40:31.880 --> 40:33.880
Yeah, theoretically, you would just...

40:33.880 --> 40:34.880
This is doing shit to me.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.880
You're dreaming about, you know,

40:36.880 --> 40:38.880
you're hanging out and you're playing badminton

40:38.880 --> 40:39.880
with Nicole Kidman in your dream,

40:39.880 --> 40:40.880
and then she, you know,

40:40.880 --> 40:42.880
and then something happens.

40:42.880 --> 40:43.880
And then, yeah.

40:43.880 --> 40:44.880
And in your dream,

40:44.880 --> 40:46.880
your body doesn't move in your dream.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.880
Otherwise, that would be sleepwalking or whatever.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.880
So you're just sitting there,

40:49.880 --> 40:51.880
but then, ostensibly, I don't...

40:51.880 --> 40:53.880
I believe the scientists,

40:53.880 --> 40:54.880
if they say this happens,

40:54.880 --> 40:56.880
that you're dreaming in your dream,

40:56.880 --> 40:57.880
you're like, hey, Nicole Kidman,

40:57.880 --> 40:58.880
come over for some lemonade.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.880
And she's like, hey, I love lemonade.

41:00.880 --> 41:01.880
I'm really grateful for it.

41:01.880 --> 41:02.880
And you're like,

41:02.880 --> 41:03.880
it's the best I can make.

41:03.880 --> 41:04.880
I mean, it's fresh lemons.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.880
And she's like, look,

41:06.880 --> 41:07.880
I feel like I owe you.

41:07.880 --> 41:08.880
I don't have any money.

41:08.880 --> 41:09.880
And you're like, look,

41:09.880 --> 41:10.880
you don't owe me anything.

41:10.880 --> 41:11.880
You're a guest at my house.

41:11.880 --> 41:12.880
It's a badminton tournament.

41:12.880 --> 41:13.880
And then she's like...

41:13.880 --> 41:15.880
And then she does something.

41:15.880 --> 41:16.880
And you know, like, you wake up

41:16.880 --> 41:17.880
and you know...

41:17.880 --> 41:18.880
It's never happened to me.

41:18.880 --> 41:19.880
Like, you know...

41:19.880 --> 41:20.880
Yeah, it's never happened to me either.

41:20.880 --> 41:21.880
You actually accumulate in your sleep.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.880
I can't believe with an imagination like that,

41:23.880 --> 41:24.880
that you couldn't...

41:24.880 --> 41:25.880
You stopped masturbating for three weeks.

41:25.880 --> 41:26.880
That's how...

41:26.880 --> 41:27.880
Well, you have...

41:27.880 --> 41:29.880
This is some heavy shit, man.

41:29.880 --> 41:30.880
Why did you stop, actually?

41:30.880 --> 41:31.880
What was the reason?

41:31.880 --> 41:32.880
Because I was trying to...

41:32.880 --> 41:34.880
I looked at the fact,

41:34.880 --> 41:35.880
and I was like,

41:35.880 --> 41:39.880
I am doing two things less than...

41:39.880 --> 41:40.880
Like, I am writing...

41:40.880 --> 41:42.880
Like, I'm not getting enough writing done.

41:42.880 --> 41:44.880
And I talked to Duncan Trussell,

41:44.880 --> 41:45.880
and he was like,

41:45.880 --> 41:46.880
yeah, it's like,

41:46.880 --> 41:47.880
is there something tied to this?

41:47.880 --> 41:48.880
You know, it's not about self-denial.

41:48.880 --> 41:49.880
It's about like,

41:49.880 --> 41:51.880
what are we really doing when we do this?

41:51.880 --> 41:52.880
And I noticed, like,

41:52.880 --> 41:53.880
when I have a deadline

41:53.880 --> 41:55.880
when I'm supposed to be writing,

41:55.880 --> 41:57.880
I break world records.

41:57.880 --> 41:58.880
It's not even...

41:58.880 --> 42:00.880
There's nothing happening down there.

42:00.880 --> 42:04.880
But I'm compulsively doing this thing

42:04.880 --> 42:06.880
because I'm trying not to write,

42:06.880 --> 42:07.880
because I'll do anything other than write.

42:07.880 --> 42:08.880
Right, yeah.

42:08.880 --> 42:09.880
So then you have a million other things,

42:09.880 --> 42:10.880
like you check your Twitter

42:10.880 --> 42:11.880
and you do blah, blah, blah.

42:11.880 --> 42:13.880
But one of the biggest things

42:13.880 --> 42:14.880
is that I really put a dent in everything.

42:14.880 --> 42:15.880
I just...

42:15.880 --> 42:16.880
It's like, if you eliminate this artificially,

42:16.880 --> 42:17.880
then like,

42:17.880 --> 42:19.880
if we close that door to that wing of the house,

42:19.880 --> 42:21.880
let's see what happens in the other wings.

42:21.880 --> 42:22.880
I see.

42:22.880 --> 42:23.880
Well, you know, the thing that's weird for me

42:23.880 --> 42:24.880
when you say that is like,

42:24.880 --> 42:26.880
it never got in my way, really.

42:26.880 --> 42:27.880
It just...

42:27.880 --> 42:28.880
See?

42:28.880 --> 42:29.880
If it was more mechanical,

42:29.880 --> 42:30.880
it was like, okay,

42:30.880 --> 42:31.880
I gotta go do this,

42:31.880 --> 42:32.880
and then I'll get back to what I was doing.

42:32.880 --> 42:33.880
Well, congratulations.

42:33.880 --> 42:34.880
Yeah.

42:34.880 --> 42:35.880
But I mean, that comes from like,

42:35.880 --> 42:36.880
years of being single.

42:36.880 --> 42:37.880
Yeah.

42:37.880 --> 42:38.880
And it just became normal to me.

42:38.880 --> 42:39.880
But anyway,

42:39.880 --> 42:40.880
I still think it's normal.

42:40.880 --> 42:41.880
Humblebrag, I guess.

42:41.880 --> 42:42.880
I don't know.

42:42.880 --> 42:45.880
I mean, I feel like...

42:45.880 --> 42:46.880
Something to do with writing,

42:46.880 --> 42:49.880
like, I could fill a Dixie cup.

42:49.880 --> 42:51.880
Like, if someone told me,

42:51.880 --> 42:54.880
you have to turn in a movie by next Wednesday,

42:54.880 --> 42:55.880
I would like...

42:55.880 --> 42:56.880
If I don't...

42:56.880 --> 42:57.880
If I don't...

42:57.880 --> 42:58.880
So I was like...

42:58.880 --> 42:59.880
That's quite...

42:59.880 --> 43:00.880
It's just a murmur of dissatisfaction

43:00.880 --> 43:01.880
going through the crowd.

43:01.880 --> 43:02.880
They don't...

43:02.880 --> 43:03.880
Yeah, people don't really...

43:03.880 --> 43:04.880
They don't like the visual,

43:04.880 --> 43:05.880
but guess what?

43:05.880 --> 43:07.880
I'm not asking this to be gross,

43:07.880 --> 43:09.880
but it's only a question.

43:09.880 --> 43:10.880
Are there women out there

43:10.880 --> 43:11.880
that do that too as compulsively as guys?

43:11.880 --> 43:12.880
They just...

43:12.880 --> 43:13.880
You have a task...

43:13.880 --> 43:14.880
They're not going to apply.

43:14.880 --> 43:15.880
Good question.

43:15.880 --> 43:16.880
I don't know.

43:16.880 --> 43:17.880
Nobody?

43:17.880 --> 43:18.880
Erin McGathy's one.

43:18.880 --> 43:19.880
You?

43:19.880 --> 43:20.880
Yeah?

43:20.880 --> 43:21.880
You masturbate quite a bit

43:21.880 --> 43:22.880
when you got...

43:22.880 --> 43:23.880
Do you procrastinate and masturbate?

43:23.880 --> 43:24.880
No.

43:24.880 --> 43:25.880
Procrasturbate,

43:25.880 --> 43:27.880
I think they call it.

43:27.880 --> 43:28.880
Title of the episode.

43:28.880 --> 43:29.880
I don't know.

43:29.880 --> 43:30.880
It's a correlation.

43:30.880 --> 43:31.880
No?

43:31.880 --> 43:32.880
You just masturbate all the time,

43:32.880 --> 43:33.880
anyway.

43:33.880 --> 43:34.880
You know what?

43:34.880 --> 43:35.880
There's playing video games.

43:35.880 --> 43:36.880
There's eating ice cream.

43:36.880 --> 43:37.880
There's masturbation.

43:37.880 --> 43:39.880
There's checking your Twitter.

43:39.880 --> 43:43.880
So all of those things are like leaves on a branch

43:43.880 --> 43:44.880
as part of a tree,

43:44.880 --> 43:46.880
and it all goes back to dopamine

43:46.880 --> 43:47.880
being generated in your brain.

43:47.880 --> 43:48.880
Yeah, yeah.

43:48.880 --> 43:49.880
No.

43:49.880 --> 43:50.880
You're comforting yourself.

43:50.880 --> 43:51.880
You go,

43:51.880 --> 43:52.880
I want to write,

43:52.880 --> 43:54.880
writing is coming up against my limitations.

43:54.880 --> 43:55.880
I don't want to be doing that.

43:55.880 --> 43:56.880
What do I want to be doing?

43:56.880 --> 43:58.880
I feel like it clears the pipes, though,

43:58.880 --> 43:59.880
because it's like,

43:59.880 --> 44:00.880
you got a lot of blockage,

44:00.880 --> 44:01.880
and you're like,

44:01.880 --> 44:03.880
fuck, I just want to watch something I'm watching,

44:03.880 --> 44:05.880
and I don't want to think about...

44:05.880 --> 44:06.880
All right, well, Abbot,

44:06.880 --> 44:07.880
I've tried using your method

44:07.880 --> 44:09.880
of clearing the pipes constantly,

44:09.880 --> 44:10.880
and I got less writing done

44:10.880 --> 44:11.880
than when I stopped drinking off.

44:11.880 --> 44:12.880
You mean weed?

44:12.880 --> 44:13.880
No.

44:13.880 --> 44:14.880
What?

44:14.880 --> 44:15.880
Clearing the pipes.

44:15.880 --> 44:16.880
Oh, sorry.

44:16.880 --> 44:17.880
I don't...

44:17.880 --> 44:18.880
Don't be sorry.

44:18.880 --> 44:19.880
Just make sense.

44:19.880 --> 44:20.880
No, no.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.880
You don't have to apologize.

44:22.880 --> 44:23.880
Just communicate.

44:23.880 --> 44:25.880
My brain did one of those, like,

44:25.880 --> 44:26.880
random things.

44:26.880 --> 44:27.880
All right.

44:27.880 --> 44:28.880
Real Abbot.

44:28.880 --> 44:29.880
Well, the...

44:29.880 --> 44:31.880
What's in the paper bag?

44:31.880 --> 44:33.880
What did you buy at the comic book store?

44:33.880 --> 44:34.880
I just, like...

44:34.880 --> 44:35.880
It's awkward because it's like,

44:35.880 --> 44:37.880
whoa, this isn't even something

44:37.880 --> 44:38.880
that I've read or I know about.

44:38.880 --> 44:39.880
I just bought...

44:39.880 --> 44:40.880
I got, like...

44:40.880 --> 44:42.880
It's Fashion Beast by Alan Moore.

44:42.880 --> 44:43.880
Issues two and three.

44:43.880 --> 44:45.880
I don't even know what it's about.

44:45.880 --> 44:46.880
Fashion Beast?

44:46.880 --> 44:47.880
Yeah, but it's like,

44:47.880 --> 44:50.880
I got it because I really like Alan Moore.

44:50.880 --> 44:52.880
Alan Moore's the next one.

44:52.880 --> 44:53.880
That sounds appealing to me,

44:53.880 --> 44:54.880
but...

44:54.880 --> 44:55.880
Alan Moore is the...

44:55.880 --> 44:57.880
He's like the Dan Harmon of comics.

44:57.880 --> 45:00.880
Well, I just saw the first five minutes

45:00.880 --> 45:02.880
of a documentary about Alan Moore.

45:02.880 --> 45:03.880
I knew nothing about him.

45:03.880 --> 45:05.880
Like, you always hear his name.

45:05.880 --> 45:07.880
I'm really late to that party.

45:07.880 --> 45:08.880
Oh, really?

45:08.880 --> 45:09.880
Yeah, yeah.

45:09.880 --> 45:10.880
I knew nothing about him.

45:10.880 --> 45:12.880
But amazing that he did all this shit

45:12.880 --> 45:14.880
that everyone makes movies about all this shit.

45:14.880 --> 45:15.880
And he hates it.

45:15.880 --> 45:16.880
Yeah, yeah.

45:16.880 --> 45:17.880
And he's like this amazing,

45:17.880 --> 45:18.880
like, articulate, like,

45:18.880 --> 45:19.880
crazy...

45:19.880 --> 45:20.880
He's like you, kind of.

45:20.880 --> 45:21.880
But, I mean,

45:21.880 --> 45:22.880
he's like quite an individual,

45:22.880 --> 45:23.880
crazy individual.

45:23.880 --> 45:24.880
Yeah, he's...

45:24.880 --> 45:26.880
Yeah, one should be envious of his,

45:26.880 --> 45:28.880
like, he just planted a flag and goes,

45:28.880 --> 45:29.880
this is who I am.

45:29.880 --> 45:30.880
He's not...

45:30.880 --> 45:31.880
Yeah.

45:31.880 --> 45:32.880
He's putting out into the world.

45:32.880 --> 45:33.880
I am at 40.

45:33.880 --> 45:34.880
I don't know.

45:34.880 --> 45:35.880
Like, I'm still...

45:35.880 --> 45:37.880
I'll probably go to my grave in this lifetime,

45:37.880 --> 45:39.880
still needing things from other people.

45:39.880 --> 45:41.880
But it's so refreshing to see somebody

45:41.880 --> 45:42.880
that's like,

45:42.880 --> 45:45.880
like, he's just like pushing shit out

45:45.880 --> 45:46.880
and going like,

45:46.880 --> 45:47.880
this is how I feel.

45:47.880 --> 45:48.880
This is how I think.

45:48.880 --> 45:49.880
And it's like a man.

45:49.880 --> 45:50.880
You can do like,

45:50.880 --> 45:51.880
go and dip a cup into his river

45:51.880 --> 45:52.880
and drink it.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.880
He's pretty interesting.

45:54.880 --> 45:55.880
Malcolm McLaren on that?

45:55.880 --> 45:57.880
Like, Malcolm McLaren?

45:57.880 --> 45:59.880
Like, Sex Pistols?

45:59.880 --> 46:01.880
Like, lipstick traces?

46:01.880 --> 46:03.880
No, I mean, he's an artist, I guess.

46:03.880 --> 46:04.880
I don't know if the Sex Pistols guy...

46:04.880 --> 46:06.880
I'm thinking of a different name, probably.

46:06.880 --> 46:07.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:07.880 --> 46:08.880
I don't think it's the same guy.

46:08.880 --> 46:09.880
Oh, is that the guy that was like the...

46:09.880 --> 46:10.880
It was the asshole that kept...

46:10.880 --> 46:11.880
Yeah.

46:11.880 --> 46:12.880
That kept sitting on heroin.

46:12.880 --> 46:13.880
Right from the book, right?

46:13.880 --> 46:14.880
That...

46:14.880 --> 46:15.880
The Phil from the Fury and Johnny Rotten

46:15.880 --> 46:16.880
blames him for killing a...

46:16.880 --> 46:17.880
for helping, you know,

46:17.880 --> 46:18.880
shit over this.

46:18.880 --> 46:19.880
Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:19.880 --> 46:20.880
Different guy?

46:20.880 --> 46:21.880
I think it's the same name, yeah.

46:21.880 --> 46:22.880
Different guy?

46:22.880 --> 46:23.880
Same guy.

46:23.880 --> 46:24.880
He's a cunt.

46:24.880 --> 46:25.880
Same guy, though?

46:25.880 --> 46:26.880
Yeah, Malcolm McLaren's a cunt

46:26.880 --> 46:27.880
and I hope he comes on the show.

46:27.880 --> 46:31.880
So the Sex Pistols guy drew this?

46:31.880 --> 46:33.880
Well, maybe he co-wrote it.

46:33.880 --> 46:35.880
All right, Bruce Valance and Malcolm...

46:35.880 --> 46:37.880
Jamal Warner, whatever.

46:37.880 --> 46:38.880
Malcolm McLaren.

46:38.880 --> 46:39.880
All right, fun.

46:39.880 --> 46:40.880
He must be Scottish.

46:40.880 --> 46:41.880
You know what, though?

46:41.880 --> 46:42.880
Alan Moore...

46:42.880 --> 46:44.880
You remember that time we saw Watchman?

46:44.880 --> 46:45.880
Yeah.

46:45.880 --> 46:47.880
And I felt so bad because, like,

46:47.880 --> 46:48.880
I love the comic.

46:48.880 --> 46:49.880
I felt bad.

46:49.880 --> 46:50.880
You know what I felt bad?

46:50.880 --> 46:51.880
What?

46:51.880 --> 46:52.880
I had just seen Watchman.

46:52.880 --> 46:53.880
Yeah.

46:53.880 --> 46:54.880
That's what was funny about it was, like,

46:54.880 --> 46:56.880
I love at the end of the movie just hearing your...

46:56.880 --> 46:58.880
You go over about how bad it was.

46:58.880 --> 46:59.880
Because I agreed.

46:59.880 --> 47:00.880
It was, like, it was so bad.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.880
And I wanted to like it so much

47:02.880 --> 47:03.880
because I love the comic.

47:03.880 --> 47:04.880
But it just didn't translate.

47:04.880 --> 47:05.880
Yeah.

47:05.880 --> 47:06.880
And then you...

47:06.880 --> 47:07.880
Yeah, it was just funny.

47:07.880 --> 47:09.880
It was a movie that set out to ask

47:09.880 --> 47:11.880
and answer the question,

47:11.880 --> 47:13.880
who watches the Watchman?

47:13.880 --> 47:16.880
It's unfair, though,

47:16.880 --> 47:18.880
because the comic is, like...

47:18.880 --> 47:19.880
It's really good.

47:19.880 --> 47:20.880
That deserved more.

47:20.880 --> 47:21.880
I don't know.

47:21.880 --> 47:22.880
That was a goodie.

47:22.880 --> 47:23.880
That was a goodie.

47:23.880 --> 47:25.880
Oh, well, you know, it kind of, like...

47:25.880 --> 47:27.880
I'm sure there were a lot of reviews

47:27.880 --> 47:29.880
that capitalized on that Tia feeling.

47:29.880 --> 47:30.880
Well, some people like it,

47:30.880 --> 47:31.880
but I was like you.

47:31.880 --> 47:33.880
I was like, I was so fucking bored.

47:33.880 --> 47:34.880
I was like, oh, God.

47:34.880 --> 47:36.880
I don't think, and I think Alan Moore

47:36.880 --> 47:37.880
would probably agree,

47:37.880 --> 47:39.880
I don't think when you adapt a comic

47:39.880 --> 47:41.880
into the television medium

47:41.880 --> 47:42.880
or the cinematic medium,

47:42.880 --> 47:44.880
I don't think your job

47:44.880 --> 47:47.880
is to take all of the content

47:47.880 --> 47:48.880
from the comic book,

47:48.880 --> 47:50.880
which is a specific medium,

47:50.880 --> 47:52.880
and translate it onto this

47:52.880 --> 47:53.880
two-dimensional stream.

47:53.880 --> 47:54.880
What was the 99 red balloons part?

47:54.880 --> 47:55.880
That was so confusing.

47:55.880 --> 47:57.880
Like, why they played that song.

47:57.880 --> 47:58.880
I was confused.

47:58.880 --> 47:59.880
I really don't remember.

47:59.880 --> 48:01.880
I don't remember that song in the comic, you know?

48:01.880 --> 48:03.880
Maybe it was playing.

48:03.880 --> 48:05.880
I must have missed something there.

48:05.880 --> 48:06.880
That was like one of those,

48:06.880 --> 48:08.880
like that movie just full of moments like that,

48:08.880 --> 48:09.880
or the guy's ass.

48:09.880 --> 48:11.880
I think that the biggest problem with cinema today

48:11.880 --> 48:14.880
is that writing is increasingly a lost art,

48:14.880 --> 48:17.880
because it gets easier and easier to...

48:17.880 --> 48:19.880
Writing software is now just like,

48:19.880 --> 48:22.880
anyone, anyone, like a fire hydrant outside.

48:22.880 --> 48:23.880
Right.

48:23.880 --> 48:27.880
Is ten fingers away from writing a screenplay.

48:27.880 --> 48:28.880
It used to be like,

48:28.880 --> 48:29.880
oh, you have to know how to set the margins.

48:29.880 --> 48:30.880
And also, what if you...

48:30.880 --> 48:32.880
Oh, there's a typo on one page,

48:32.880 --> 48:33.880
and you're going to get out white out

48:33.880 --> 48:34.880
or type the page over again.

48:34.880 --> 48:36.880
There used to be a filter there

48:36.880 --> 48:38.880
that guaranteed that people who were definitely

48:38.880 --> 48:40.880
passionate about getting that job done right

48:40.880 --> 48:41.880
were the people that did that stuff.

48:41.880 --> 48:43.880
Now, fuck it.

48:43.880 --> 48:44.880
It's as easy as, like, you know,

48:44.880 --> 48:45.880
Tiddlywinks.

48:45.880 --> 48:47.880
And directing is not the case.

48:47.880 --> 48:49.880
So you have these geniuses, these visionaries

48:49.880 --> 48:51.880
who are so good at knowing where to put the camera

48:51.880 --> 48:53.880
and so passionate about the, you know,

48:53.880 --> 48:55.880
the ways to use all this new technology,

48:55.880 --> 48:58.880
the CG of those guys doing amazing things.

48:58.880 --> 48:59.880
It's like, oh, this shot, like,

48:59.880 --> 49:01.880
I want to show that die-hard movie,

49:01.880 --> 49:02.880
the Born Paternity, you know,

49:02.880 --> 49:04.880
where these are jumping out the...

49:04.880 --> 49:06.880
Born Paternity.

49:06.880 --> 49:07.880
The most amazing effects I've seen to date,

49:07.880 --> 49:09.880
but it's this shitty die-hard sequel.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.880
It's like, it's poorly written, you know.

49:11.880 --> 49:13.880
The writing is not...

49:13.880 --> 49:15.880
Because we've now regarded writing as like,

49:15.880 --> 49:16.880
ah, fuck you.

49:16.880 --> 49:17.880
Give me the script. Hurry up.

49:17.880 --> 49:18.880
Give me the script.

49:18.880 --> 49:19.880
Give me the script, Fatty.

49:19.880 --> 49:20.880
Thank you.

49:20.880 --> 49:21.880
Hey, ten fatties. Ten fatties.

49:21.880 --> 49:23.880
Got any ten fatties?

49:23.880 --> 49:25.880
Rewrite it. Rewrite it.

49:25.880 --> 49:27.880
Just keep rewriting it.

49:27.880 --> 49:28.880
Keep rewriting it.

49:28.880 --> 49:29.880
You fucking fatty.

49:29.880 --> 49:30.880
You neckbeards. You fucking...

49:30.880 --> 49:32.880
You love Die Hard,

49:32.880 --> 49:34.880
and it's a good, for a good reason

49:34.880 --> 49:36.880
because that was based on a novel.

49:36.880 --> 49:37.880
No, no, that's not why.

49:37.880 --> 49:38.880
It's because the movie was good.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.880
I don't know, the novel can suck my dick.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.880
It is a good movie, but I think because it was based on a novel.

49:42.880 --> 49:44.880
Die Hard 2 was based on a novel.

49:44.880 --> 49:45.880
Die Hard 3 was probably based on a novel.

49:45.880 --> 49:47.880
I don't think there's three Die Hard novels.

49:47.880 --> 49:48.880
There's gotta be just one.

49:48.880 --> 49:50.880
No, Abbot, there wasn't...

49:50.880 --> 49:52.880
There was no Die Hard novel.

49:52.880 --> 49:54.880
There was a Die Hard novel.

49:54.880 --> 49:55.880
I've seen the cover.

49:55.880 --> 49:56.880
Abbot, it wasn't called Die Hard.

49:56.880 --> 49:58.880
I know it was called Something the Building Blew Up.

49:58.880 --> 49:59.880
Exactly.

49:59.880 --> 50:00.880
No, no, something...

50:00.880 --> 50:02.880
And then there was another novel called

50:02.880 --> 50:04.880
Something the Airport Blew Up.

50:04.880 --> 50:05.880
It wasn't related.

50:05.880 --> 50:08.880
It wasn't called Nakatomi 2, the airport this time.

50:08.880 --> 50:09.880
Oh, I see, I see.

50:09.880 --> 50:10.880
It's not...

50:10.880 --> 50:12.880
I'm saying, like, for the Die Hard movies,

50:12.880 --> 50:13.880
they take novels and they go,

50:13.880 --> 50:15.880
oh, then John McLean's in there too.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.880
I've never read any of these books.

50:17.880 --> 50:19.880
You know Frank Sinatra was in there some movies.

50:19.880 --> 50:21.880
The Die Hard franchise is...

50:21.880 --> 50:22.880
The detective.

50:22.880 --> 50:23.880
What was that?

50:23.880 --> 50:24.880
The detective.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.880
The detective?

50:25.880 --> 50:26.880
Okay, there's a...

50:26.880 --> 50:28.880
I'm out of my depth here, but...

50:28.880 --> 50:30.880
There's a novel that Die Hard's based on.

50:30.880 --> 50:31.880
They at one time...

50:31.880 --> 50:32.880
Did they make it?

50:32.880 --> 50:33.880
Did they make the movie?

50:33.880 --> 50:36.880
Yeah, it's in the same series of books.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.880
But did they make a movie with Sinatra?

50:38.880 --> 50:39.880
Yeah.

50:39.880 --> 50:41.880
Okay, so there's a Sinatra movie called...

50:41.880 --> 50:42.880
John McLean.

50:42.880 --> 50:43.880
The detective.

50:43.880 --> 50:46.880
And which Sinatra is the John McLean character.

50:46.880 --> 50:47.880
I've never seen it.

50:47.880 --> 50:48.880
I did not know that.

50:48.880 --> 50:49.880
That's crazy.

50:49.880 --> 50:50.880
I mean, is it any good?

50:50.880 --> 50:51.880
Good old Sinatra.

50:51.880 --> 50:52.880
I've never seen it.

50:52.880 --> 50:53.880
Oh, wow.

50:53.880 --> 50:54.880
That's cool.

50:54.880 --> 50:55.880
Yeah, it's kind of interesting.

50:55.880 --> 50:56.880
He was a good actor, right?

50:56.880 --> 50:57.880
Like my ensuring candidate?

50:57.880 --> 50:58.880
Wasn't he good in that?

50:58.880 --> 51:01.880
He was good for a guy who sang for a living for sure, yeah.

51:01.880 --> 51:04.880
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's not like that today, right?

51:04.880 --> 51:05.880
I don't know.

51:05.880 --> 51:07.880
He won the Oscar from here to Eternity or something like that?

51:07.880 --> 51:08.880
Yeah, yeah, I mean, he was sharp.

51:08.880 --> 51:09.880
He was a good actor.

51:09.880 --> 51:10.880
Yeah.

51:10.880 --> 51:11.880
Anyways, it doesn't matter.

51:11.880 --> 51:14.880
The director, the writers of the...

51:14.880 --> 51:16.880
Good movies are often a fluke.

51:16.880 --> 51:18.880
Like Die Hard 1 was really good.

51:18.880 --> 51:19.880
You can't repeat.

51:19.880 --> 51:20.880
Everyone tries to repeat.

51:20.880 --> 51:23.880
Like you get, let's get John McLean into direct another thing.

51:23.880 --> 51:25.880
It's like, it's very, very difficult to...

51:25.880 --> 51:26.880
It was like lightning in a bottle.

51:26.880 --> 51:28.880
It's just sort of like an accident.

51:28.880 --> 51:32.880
You can see from the movie, like they weren't trying to make an awesome classic action film

51:32.880 --> 51:34.880
that was going to influence everything.

51:34.880 --> 51:35.880
Yeah, same with Ghostbusters.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.880
That second one is painful.

51:37.880 --> 51:38.880
Yeah.

51:38.880 --> 51:39.880
Right?

51:39.880 --> 51:40.880
It's so painful.

51:40.880 --> 51:43.880
Because they're so close, but they're just so off the mark at every scene.

51:43.880 --> 51:44.880
Yeah.

51:44.880 --> 51:46.880
I mean, when they get on the slime and they're fighting, it's ridiculous.

51:46.880 --> 51:50.880
And you get the DVDs and you can watch the deleted scenes on the first Ghostbusters movie,

51:50.880 --> 51:51.880
or Stripes or anything.

51:51.880 --> 51:55.880
All these awesome, like Ivan Reitman movies, you get to the deleted scenes and then you

51:55.880 --> 51:59.880
go, holy shit, if these eight scenes had been in the movie, this thing would have been a

51:59.880 --> 52:01.880
random mishmash.

52:01.880 --> 52:05.880
And the last thing we should take away from that is a little, like a nice humble one.

52:05.880 --> 52:09.880
It's like the thing that we're trying to achieve is a spiritual event.

52:09.880 --> 52:10.880
It's a collaboration.

52:10.880 --> 52:12.880
Like you're not, no one's a genius.

52:12.880 --> 52:13.880
You're a Kowski Brothers.

52:13.880 --> 52:14.880
You're not a genius.

52:14.880 --> 52:20.880
Like you sat down and you made a movie called The Matrix where you were so joyful.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.880
You were like, I hope we make a good movie.

52:22.880 --> 52:23.880
Oh, I love this movie.

52:23.880 --> 52:24.880
I love that movie.

52:24.880 --> 52:25.880
I love that movie.

52:25.880 --> 52:27.880
You make The Matrix kind of on accident.

52:27.880 --> 52:28.880
You make Jaws on accident.

52:28.880 --> 52:29.880
You make Die Hard on accident.

52:29.880 --> 52:31.880
Like there's smart people.

52:31.880 --> 52:32.880
There's dumb people.

52:32.880 --> 52:33.880
There's talented people.

52:33.880 --> 52:34.880
There's passionate people.

52:34.880 --> 52:36.880
But when you make a good movie, you're fucking lucky.

52:36.880 --> 52:40.880
No, and back to the future, because it's like, that movie's so perfect.

52:40.880 --> 52:43.880
You watched them again recently, and the second one is just off.

52:43.880 --> 52:46.880
It's like, ah, there's all these levels to it that aren't working.

52:46.880 --> 52:47.880
Yeah, there's no way.

52:47.880 --> 52:49.880
Even the almighty Empire Strikes Back.

52:49.880 --> 52:51.880
Everyone goes, oh, I love it.

52:51.880 --> 52:55.880
No, you remember being 11, and it gave you so much.

52:55.880 --> 52:57.880
It gave you so much more action figure-wise.

52:57.880 --> 53:01.880
Wait, are you saying that you don't like Empire?

53:01.880 --> 53:06.880
I'm just saying it's, I'm saying that unlike, I'm 40 years old.

53:06.880 --> 53:07.880
He's so bored.

53:07.880 --> 53:08.880
I'm entitled to my opinion.

53:08.880 --> 53:09.880
You look bored.

53:09.880 --> 53:12.880
I don't think it's the best movie of the Star Wars trilogy.

53:12.880 --> 53:21.880
I think that Star Wars is so good that Empire Strikes Back can sit on it as a patio and not break.

53:21.880 --> 53:25.880
But see, you're looking at it as like the foundation is what makes the second one important, right?

53:25.880 --> 53:26.880
That's where your angle is?

53:26.880 --> 53:30.880
I'm looking at timelessness and storytelling and clear, simple things.

53:30.880 --> 53:33.880
Like Star Wars could be a cowboy movie.

53:33.880 --> 53:34.880
You could tell the same story.

53:34.880 --> 53:36.880
The little farm boy from a small farm town.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.880
He becomes a bigger part of a bigger world.

53:38.880 --> 53:41.880
Empire Strikes Back is driven by sci-fi concepts.

53:41.880 --> 53:45.880
If there's no big penis monster trying to swallow your spatial, there's no movie.

53:45.880 --> 53:46.880
It doesn't make sense.

53:46.880 --> 53:51.880
A plot point is we're inside a squishy thing and there's a million plot points in Empire Strikes Back

53:51.880 --> 53:53.880
that are like, it has to be a sci-fi movie.

53:53.880 --> 53:56.880
So it's just at the end of the day a good sci-fi movie Star Wars is a timeless masterpiece.

53:56.880 --> 53:57.880
Let's move on.

53:57.880 --> 53:59.880
Okay, well, all right, all right, yeah.

53:59.880 --> 54:05.880
I mean, after dinner, I want to say, I mean, after the show, I want to tell you why I think Empire is better.

54:05.880 --> 54:06.880
After dinner?

54:06.880 --> 54:09.880
Did you just ask Dan out on a date?

54:09.880 --> 54:12.880
You caught me.

54:12.880 --> 54:14.880
Next week, we're going to hear about that date.

54:14.880 --> 54:15.880
Slick way.

54:15.880 --> 54:19.880
And then we're going to find out that he left like a sock at your place.

54:19.880 --> 54:24.880
Is it possible to have Abed play Chris de Burgh?

54:24.880 --> 54:26.880
I'm assuming Camille's not here.

54:26.880 --> 54:27.880
Camille, not Johnny.

54:27.880 --> 54:31.880
Can we get another mic for Aaron and bring, let's get Spencer up here.

54:31.880 --> 54:34.880
I'm kind of a D&D virgin.

54:34.880 --> 54:35.880
You know what I mean?

54:35.880 --> 54:36.880
I'm a D&D virgin.

54:36.880 --> 54:37.880
I've never played before.

54:37.880 --> 54:38.880
That's all right.

54:38.880 --> 54:39.880
It's fine.

54:39.880 --> 54:40.880
I know.

54:40.880 --> 54:41.880
But don't I have to know stuff?

54:41.880 --> 54:42.880
No.

54:42.880 --> 54:43.880
No.

54:43.880 --> 54:46.880
Spencer, everyone.

54:46.880 --> 54:47.880
And Erin McGathy.

54:47.880 --> 54:52.880
I think I just ran into these right now.

54:52.880 --> 54:54.880
Put them off to the side kind of.

54:54.880 --> 54:55.880
They're in the way.

54:55.880 --> 54:56.880
Just put them there.

54:56.880 --> 54:57.880
Thank you.

54:57.880 --> 54:58.880
Hello, Spencer.

54:58.880 --> 54:59.880
How are you doing today, man?

54:59.880 --> 55:00.880
I'm doing good.

55:00.880 --> 55:01.880
I just dropped a dice.

55:01.880 --> 55:02.880
I'm doing good.

55:02.880 --> 55:03.880
You can sit down.

55:03.880 --> 55:04.880
I'll stand.

55:04.880 --> 55:05.880
You dropped a dice?

55:05.880 --> 55:06.880
That's fine.

55:06.880 --> 55:07.880
What did you roll?

55:07.880 --> 55:08.880
I can't see it.

55:08.880 --> 55:10.880
That's a good sign, though.

55:10.880 --> 55:12.880
Dice on the floor.

55:12.880 --> 55:13.880
Adventures galore.

55:13.880 --> 55:17.880
Dice on the table.

55:17.880 --> 55:21.880
Evil is able to happen.

55:21.880 --> 55:22.880
To happen.

55:22.880 --> 55:24.880
Are you awkward that I stand?

55:24.880 --> 55:26.880
Or, you know, should I sit down?

55:26.880 --> 55:27.880
I am awkward that I stand, yeah.

55:27.880 --> 55:29.880
But I'll be so far down it'll be like weird.

55:29.880 --> 55:30.880
No, you can stand.

55:30.880 --> 55:31.880
Actually, you sit.

55:31.880 --> 55:32.880
I don't want to be a rude host.

55:32.880 --> 55:33.880
Are you sure?

55:33.880 --> 55:34.880
Well, now I feel bad.

55:34.880 --> 55:38.880
You're a doctor host.

55:38.880 --> 55:41.880
We're most comfortable when you feel bad.

55:41.880 --> 55:42.880
That's true.

55:42.880 --> 55:44.880
You're like Superman in the train tracks.

55:44.880 --> 55:49.880
You'll be filling in for Camille's character, Chris de Burghh, who is a thief.

55:49.880 --> 55:50.880
I'm not mistaken, right, Spencer?

55:50.880 --> 55:51.880
That's correct.

55:51.880 --> 55:52.880
A rogue.

55:52.880 --> 55:53.880
Chris de Burghh, like Christ Berg?

55:53.880 --> 55:54.880
Yes.

55:54.880 --> 55:55.880
Yes.

55:55.880 --> 55:56.880
He's a Jewish messiah.

55:56.880 --> 55:59.880
He wrote Lady in Red, Chris de Burghh.

55:59.880 --> 56:03.880
Yeah, he wrote the song, The Lady in Red, from the 80s.

56:03.880 --> 56:04.880
Right, right.

56:04.880 --> 56:09.380
And he's been on hard times, but now he's taken part in our adventure with us and our quest

56:09.380 --> 56:10.880
towards wherever the hell we're going.

56:10.880 --> 56:11.880
I don't know, is it?

56:11.880 --> 56:12.880
We got through all of my items.

56:12.880 --> 56:16.880
Is he like a new member of the correct quest, like he just joined?

56:16.880 --> 56:17.880
Yeah.

56:17.880 --> 56:18.880
Okay.

56:18.880 --> 56:19.880
Yeah.

56:19.880 --> 56:20.880
Sorry.

56:20.880 --> 56:23.880
Spencer, are you ready to get us up to date?

56:23.880 --> 56:24.880
Not quite.

56:24.880 --> 56:25.880
I mean, what's up, you guys?

56:25.880 --> 56:26.880
No, let's kill some time.

56:26.880 --> 56:27.880
Okay, cool.

56:27.880 --> 56:30.880
Dan, I got to say great analogies tonight.

56:30.880 --> 56:31.880
Oh, thank you.

56:31.880 --> 56:32.880
You.

56:32.880 --> 56:37.880
It always sounds sarcastic when I'm complimenting you, but it's really good.

56:37.880 --> 56:40.880
The omelet line and the...

56:40.880 --> 56:42.880
What was the pepper of the...

56:42.880 --> 56:44.880
Yeah, that either your omelet needs something.

56:44.880 --> 56:45.880
Oh, thanks, baby.

56:45.880 --> 56:46.880
Great guys.

56:46.880 --> 56:50.880
How are you enjoying living with me?

56:50.880 --> 56:51.880
I'm loving it.

56:51.880 --> 56:52.880
Yeah, we're making the space.

56:52.880 --> 56:56.880
I had planned to turn into a giant master bathroom into your little art studio.

56:56.880 --> 56:57.880
Mm-hmm.

56:57.880 --> 56:58.880
Yeah.

56:58.880 --> 56:59.880
I like that.

56:59.880 --> 57:00.880
It's a nice testament to...

57:00.880 --> 57:01.880
It's like, you know what?

57:01.880 --> 57:04.880
I'll keep using a slightly smaller bathroom.

57:04.880 --> 57:09.880
It's like, you know, that's what, you know, relationships are.

57:09.880 --> 57:12.880
Every time I walk in that room, I really feel your love.

57:12.880 --> 57:16.880
You feel the ghost of my dreams of having like this Roman bath.

57:16.880 --> 57:18.880
Ghost of your dreams.

57:18.880 --> 57:19.880
This colligulant like...

57:19.880 --> 57:25.880
I was going to have people pour pictures of hot water over me.

57:25.880 --> 57:27.880
Yeah, it's like, now it's where you make calendars.

57:27.880 --> 57:31.880
That would be awesome to have a room in your house that's actually a big bath,

57:31.880 --> 57:34.880
but there's always a bunch of old Roman senators in there.

57:34.880 --> 57:36.880
They're always plotting against me.

57:36.880 --> 57:40.880
No matter where I'm at.

57:40.880 --> 57:41.880
Oh, whoa.

57:41.880 --> 57:42.880
Dan, sorry.

57:42.880 --> 57:43.880
We didn't know you were here.

57:43.880 --> 57:46.880
No matter where I'm at in my life, they're always plotting against me.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.880
It just makes me feel more important.

57:48.880 --> 57:50.880
I think I would like an egg salad sandwich.

57:50.880 --> 57:51.880
Oh, of course.

57:51.880 --> 57:54.880
What are you whispering about?

57:54.880 --> 57:55.880
Nothing, sir.

57:55.880 --> 57:56.880
Nothing.

57:56.880 --> 57:57.880
Egg salad.

57:57.880 --> 57:58.880
The perfect choice.

57:58.880 --> 58:00.880
But just to come home from work and go into the...

58:00.880 --> 58:02.880
Yeah, Aaron, I'm going to go on and take a steam and you're going in a...

58:02.880 --> 58:03.880
Hello, Gragas.

58:03.880 --> 58:04.880
Hello, Thrasius.

58:04.880 --> 58:08.880
But then you also go to the drawing room and I go like,

58:08.880 --> 58:10.880
I think Gragas and Fraxie are...

58:10.880 --> 58:14.880
I don't think they wanted me to have an egg salad sandwich.

58:14.880 --> 58:16.880
I fear the game is afoot.

58:16.880 --> 58:19.880
Also, I've never seen them outside of the steam room.

58:19.880 --> 58:20.880
Yeah, no.

58:20.880 --> 58:23.880
I think I'm safe in that regard because they're pretty unmotivated.

58:23.880 --> 58:25.880
Yeah, because I don't bathe often.

58:25.880 --> 58:27.880
So it's a den of thieves in there.

58:27.880 --> 58:29.880
It's a sewing circle.

58:29.880 --> 58:31.880
That's the best.

58:31.880 --> 58:34.880
One of them is always Malcolm McDowell.

58:34.880 --> 58:36.880
Sure, sure.

58:36.880 --> 58:38.880
I love it.

58:38.880 --> 58:42.880
I think I have this sweater, but mine's blue.

58:42.880 --> 58:43.880
Did you get that at...

58:43.880 --> 58:44.880
Fashion Beast.

58:44.880 --> 58:47.880
Yeah, I'm the Fashion Beast.

58:47.880 --> 58:48.880
Did you get that at...

58:48.880 --> 58:49.880
I have that sweater.

58:49.880 --> 58:50.880
Where did you get that?

58:50.880 --> 58:52.880
We shop at the same store.

58:52.880 --> 58:54.880
I don't know.

58:54.880 --> 58:56.880
21 Forever?

58:56.880 --> 58:57.880
Target.

58:57.880 --> 58:59.880
Yeah, that's where I got mine.

58:59.880 --> 59:01.880
See, I knew I was just pointing...

59:01.880 --> 59:02.880
People are going on Target.

59:02.880 --> 59:04.880
You know this sweater from Target?

59:04.880 --> 59:05.880
So you have...

59:05.880 --> 59:08.880
Lady, take it easy.

59:08.880 --> 59:09.880
I'm kidding.

59:09.880 --> 59:10.880
Jeremy, did you cut off the sleeves?

59:10.880 --> 59:11.880
I'm Paula from Scotland.

59:11.880 --> 59:12.880
Paula from Scotland?

59:12.880 --> 59:13.880
No, I don't cut Paula.

59:13.880 --> 59:16.880
I'm a big Teenage Fan Club fan.

59:16.880 --> 59:18.880
They're amazing.

59:18.880 --> 59:21.880
Way to connect those dots, man.

59:21.880 --> 59:24.880
Great job on Teenage Fan Club, by the way.

59:24.880 --> 59:26.880
And Arab Strap, they're great.

59:26.880 --> 59:29.880
She's so enough of you, Jeff, you have no idea.

59:29.880 --> 59:32.880
Where are you from?

59:32.880 --> 59:33.880
What?

59:33.880 --> 59:35.880
London, wow.

59:35.880 --> 59:37.880
She just said she's so in love with you, Jeff,

59:37.880 --> 59:38.880
you have no idea.

59:38.880 --> 59:39.880
Podcast listeners.

59:39.880 --> 59:40.880
I like he was a friend.

59:40.880 --> 59:45.880
It's a lot happening.

59:45.880 --> 59:47.880
Thank you, Paula.

59:47.880 --> 59:48.880
But you have to hear the accents, really.

59:48.880 --> 59:49.880
I hope the mic's picked up.

59:49.880 --> 59:52.880
It's like a terrible sequel to Trainspotting or something.

59:52.880 --> 59:54.880
They have a cool accent.

59:54.880 --> 59:56.880
It works against them, because I'm sure they're already drunk,

59:56.880 --> 59:58.880
but the Scottish accent, yeah.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880
What?

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.880
The Scottish accent makes you sound twice as drunk.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:06.880
It's amazing.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.880
It's a great day for multi-colour racing.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.880
Wow.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.880
Offensive and an old reference.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.880
I took a comedy sports accent workshop.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.880
Give me an accent.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.880
Irish.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.880
You think you love me, but you don't.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.880
Boston.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.880
Boston.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.880
I'm wicked retarded.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:42.880
Madagascar.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.880
It's not bad.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.880
That was more Mozambique.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.880
Can you do Australian?

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.880
Yeah.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.880
Boomerang.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.880
Forget it.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.880
I only knew the Irish and Scottish ones.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.880
Thanks for hitting those first.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.880
We should have stopped there.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.880
All right.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.880
How about Russian?

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.880
You got to have a Mozambique squirrel.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.880
You are giving me microfiche.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.880
French.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.880
German.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:21.880
We must get the cereal.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.880
Go on.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.880
The cereal nut.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:30.880
For cereal is important for multi-colour racing.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.880
Must a next multi-colour track.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.880
Let me see your papers.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.880
Your papers, sir.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.880
Your papers.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.880
My papers are running.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.880
Opening smart car.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.880
Multi-car racing.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.880
Must ignore multi-car siren.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.880
Racing out of Berlin.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.880
Double agent.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:53.880
All points both of them.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.880
A man pretending to be Scottish

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.880
is driving towards the German border.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.880
Meanwhile at the Reichstag.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.880
Signing these Hitler papers is so boring.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.880
Where is my cereal?

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.880
Father.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.880
Why can't I find my cereal in Germany?

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.880
Father.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.880
I'm Hitler.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880
Right.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.880
I'm Hitler.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.880
I'm your father.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.880
You loved cereal.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.880
Just be careful, my son.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:30.880
When you die, millions of people will shit in your pants.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.880
Hear me now and believe me later.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.880
Oh, I'm handsome.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.880
Oh, I'm being shot.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.880
I'm Hitler.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.880
Hitler only got away with what he did

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.880
because the cops couldn't find him.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.880
The whole time the German police are like,

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.880
that's not right.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.880
You're under arrest, but we can't find him.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.880
He's just like, smoking weed at your house.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880
He's just killing 6 million people

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.880
and I was looking for him.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.880
All right, all right, that's enough.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.880
You're coming downtown, Hitler.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.880
Even the German police are Irish.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.880
Oh, what do we got here?

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.880
Oh, I don't know, Glancy.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.880
We're shutting you down, Hitler.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.880
Looks like someone's committed a wee bit to genocide.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.880
Oh, tell it to the judge.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.880
Oh, no.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.880
Hitler only got a few minutes.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.880
Oh, yeah, I'll keep talking, sir.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.880
You're coming downtown.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.880
I'm from the Gestapo.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.880
No, they're not.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.880
The Gestapo's his anyway.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.880
They're a little better, please.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.880
They got Billy Clebsack.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.880
I don't think so.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.880
All right, Jesus, let's play some sad music.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.880
Let's bring this thing on.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.880
Get us up to date, would you?

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:46.880
All right, last time on Harmontown, our heroes.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.880
What?

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880
Nothing.

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.880
This is good.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.880
They would have heard it on Harmontown.

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:52.880
Yeah.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.880
Yeah, with the help of Chris de Burghh,

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.880
traverse the dark forests of Twyla.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.880
The troop defeated a small horde of zombies

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.880
before coming upon the ruins of Merchul.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.880
Passing strange statues,

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.880
moving away to a mysterious stand of trees

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.880
entwined and entangled into a massive clump

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.880
of trunks and brambles.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.880
Throwing caution to the wind,

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.880
Quark jumped through a narrow crack in the trees,

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.880
falling into a muddy hole below.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.880
Soon after, the rest of the party followed,

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.880
and together they found themselves stuck in the muck.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.880
After searching around in the darkness,

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880
they found an odd tile,

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.880
discovering it to be made of thin wood

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880
and kicked it to kindling.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.880
Sharpie cast light on an arrow,

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.880
which Chris de Burghh handily shot through the open,

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.880
and crawled through into the narrow tunnel,

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.880
examining a large mosaic depicting a green dragon

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.880
on the floor.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.880
He attempted to remove what appeared to be a massive treasure

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.880
before he realized he'd sprung a Schrab.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.880
Ah, I'm so sorry, this is awful.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.880
Fuck everything.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.880
No, it's great.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.880
I'm just gonna leave right now.

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:49.880
What's going on? What do you mean?

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.880
I'm not reading off of this.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.880
You're not living up to the Harmontown mark of quality?

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.880
You set such a big standard, you know?

01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.880
Yeah, it's been a tight show.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.880
It's a hard act to follow.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.880
Yeah. Seamless.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.880
A solid wall of thick stone thudded into the ground,

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.880
blocking the exit, began rumbling toward the songmaster.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.880
What would he do? What would he do?

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.880
Still, he gets the music just right.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.880
Spencer, I'm gonna call bullshit on that one.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.880
I think he fabricated it.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.880
I think you knew the music was longer than you needed,

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:28.880
and you faked a moment of insecurity

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.880
just so you could come back and just, like,

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.880
come right down on the end of the music.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.880
It came from a real moment of insecurity,

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.880
but I realized I could twist it to my advantage.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:39.880
All right.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.880
All right, I examine our immediate surrounding, Spencer.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.880
Okay, so you guys were in this dark pit.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.880
There was this hole.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.880
Christopher crawled through it,

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.880
and he was looking at the floor,

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.880
and then he was trying to extricate a large ruby,

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.880
and that caused a trap to go off,

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.880
causing a wall to separate the two of you.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.880
The wall started approaching,

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.880
threatening to crush him against the wall.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.880
I have evasion as a special ability.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.880
Can I evade?

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.880
You cannot evade getting crushed to death

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.880
between two walls.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:11.880
Oh, no.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.880
So you were...

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880
You got a moment?

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.880
When you were playing as Kumail,

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.880
or when Kumail was playing as your character,

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.880
who you're playing as, whatever,

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.880
he was pulling the ruby out of the ground,

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.880
and it was big.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880
It was this big thing,

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.880
and he was starting to get it,

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.880
and it was starting to come out of the ground.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.880
But, you know, he's trapped because, like,

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.880
you don't know if you want to pull it out of the ground.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.880
Can you put the ruby back in and stop the wall?

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.880
Yeah, I'm going to put the ruby back,

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.880
because that seems like a no-no.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.880
Dropping the ruby had falls into its place.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.880
The wall continues to advance.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.880
Oh, no.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.880
So from our perspective,

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.880
we see a wall moving forward.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880
Yeah, okay.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.880
So, like I said, there's this hole.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.880
At this point, you're probably peering through,

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.880
because you're like, what the fuck, right?

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.880
So, Quark, he tried to jump through

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.880
and save him, if I recall correctly,

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.880
but the wall thudded down before that.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.880
So, he's probably in the best position

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.880
to see what's going on.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.880
But, yeah, basically you saw the wall come down,

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.880
and it's going towards...

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.880
So, the wall's in between me and Christopher right now?

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.880
Yeah, and you can tell from what you've seen

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.880
that it's probably going to crush him.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.880
And the wall's moving away from Jeff.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.880
Away from you.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.880
Is there a way to get over the wall?

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.880
It goes from the ceiling all the way down.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.880
So, there's no way to get around it or over or under it?

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.880
Not as far as you can tell.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.880
Damn it.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.880
I look around on the floor

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.880
for any kind of triggers or traps

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.880
to sense some way to stop this.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.880
All right.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.880
Nope.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.880
Oops.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.880
All right.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:41.880
Let me ask you a question.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:42.880
Sidebar.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880
Okay.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880
This takes no time.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.880
Quick.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.880
Anyway, even though it takes no time.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.880
Tensors floating desk.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.880
Yeah.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.880
It takes up space, right?

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.880
We've written upon it.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.880
So, it's a thing that physically occupies space.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.880
Yeah.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.880
Can I cast it through a wall?

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.880
My objective would be to cast Tensors floating desk

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.880
as a wedge, Indiana Jones style,

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.880
like wedge the...

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.880
like create a space that couldn't, you know, to hold it.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.880
Okay.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.880
So, if this was like a weak force

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.880
that wouldn't be capable of crushing a human to death,

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.880
like that might function.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.880
Right.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.880
So, you don't have line of effect to the target.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.880
Right.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:21.880
Okay.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.880
To my understanding.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.880
All right.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.880
All right.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.880
Fine.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:26.880
Anybody out in the audience have any ideas for this?

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.880
Magic hand.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:28.880
Magic hand, says Jeremy.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.880
A hole.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.880
A hole.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880
I'm dying.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.880
Or the portable hole?

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.880
Is there a hole?

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.880
Is it nearby?

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.880
You don't have the portable hole.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.880
No, you got...

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.880
I don't have the portable...

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880
I don't have a...

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.880
What is this?

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:40.880
A portable wire?

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.880
No, that's not a hole.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.880
Nope.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.880
I have Mage Hand, but I already...

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.880
I asked about that last week.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.880
That can only inflict very light forces.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.880
Yeah, it says five pounds of force somewhere.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.880
Yeah, it's pretty weak.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:50.880
Why did you ask that hair dryer?

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.880
How big is the ruby?

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.880
How big is the ruby?

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.880
Does it have girth?

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.880
I'd say it's about...

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.880
Does the ruby have girth?

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.880
Somebody asks.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.880
I think I know the answer.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880
Wait.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.880
What were you going to say, sir?

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.880
Is it larger than the width of a human body?

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.880
I'd say, yeah.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.880
It's roughly the size of a manhole cover.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880
Okay.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.880
Can he line up the ruby and wedge himself like...

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.880
If he left it out, perhaps.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.880
I think I'm going to lift that ruby out.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880
All right.

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.880
Sounds like a good plan.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.880
What's the hole like?

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.880
Is a hole big enough for him to get inside or not?

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.880
There's not a hole so much as a socket in which a ruby is sitting.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.880
Right.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.880
Okay.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.880
Anyway, you tug at the ruby with all your might.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880
It begins to budge.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.880
You think you're making good progress.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.880
It's going to take a couple more tugs or so.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.880
The wall continues its approach.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.880
Tug, Chris.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.880
Tug.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.880
I'm tugging.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.880
I'm tugging.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.880
Continuing to tug.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880
I'm continuing to tug.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880
Continuing to tug.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.880
You increase your tugging speed and intensity.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880
I'm going faster.

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.880
Are you masturbating in there?

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880
What's going on?

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.880
That's what I just realized.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.880
No, I'm tugging at a ruby, man.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.880
All right.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.880
Okay.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.880
Soon the oval ruby grows dislodged from its socket and you can see below a deep dark hole.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880
Whoa.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880
Whoa.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.880
Okay, wait.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880
Oh, I didn't mean to make fun of you.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.880
Sorry.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.880
No, no, no.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.880
That's my natural reaction.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880
That was my...

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880
Yeah.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880
That was your natural reaction to your natural reaction.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880
Well, there you go.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.880
I'm enjoying myself.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.880
Chris, can you get inside the hole that the ruby occupied?

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.880
Is it big enough for you?

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:18.880
Definitely.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.880
Well, I will...

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:25.880
I think I'm going to throw that 150-foot rope down the hole and we can all climb.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.880
Well, you can climb.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.880
It's just you in that little section right now.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880
Oh, well, I'll climb.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:30.880
Yeah.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.880
All right.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.880
I'm going to climb down this hole.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.880
Quickly, throwing the rope down to the hatch.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.880
You notice that it's not tied to anything.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.880
It falls down the hole.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.880
Don't throw the rope down before you tie it to something, Chris.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.880
I can't cast reduced person through the thing.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.880
I need to line a site.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880
Yeah.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880
Yeah, maybe you can save that rope.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.880
No way.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880
He doesn't know what's happening.

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880
Did he just throw the rope down the hole?

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.880
Yeah.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.880
Just throwing it like a piece of garbage?

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.880
Bye, rope.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.880
Jesus.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.880
Can you shimmy down or climb down?

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.880
The wall continues its approach.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880
Fuck, dude.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.880
Well, I guess I'm going to jump down this hole.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.880
I mean, here we go.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.880
Try going down slowly, like with your hands out.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.880
Yeah, can I do that?

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880
Am I that cool?

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.880
I mean, yeah, yeah.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.880
Oh, no.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.880
You know what?

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.880
I have this crazy skill that I saw earlier.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.880
It's called Master Climbing Kit.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:16.880
I'm going to use that.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.880
Okay.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.880
Well, that would work if you had a rope.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:24.880
Fuck, this fucking rope is going to be the death of me.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880
Wait.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.880
Can I use my anchor to slow down the wall?

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.880
What?

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.880
Can I use my anchor to slow down the wall?

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880
Your anchor.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.880
That it would you, if you could dock it to something on the wall.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880
Okay.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880
You look at the wall.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.880
It doesn't have any dockable surfaces for an anchor to attach to.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880
Otherwise, yeah.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.880
Okay.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.880
If you're talking about Quall's Feather Token, it creates a magical anchor.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.880
Okay.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.880
I feed Coco a carrot.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.880
Coco's out of the dungeon.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.880
Sorry.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.880
I'm going to jump down the hole.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.880
I mean, what's happening?

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.880
You lowered yourself down the hole, but you fail and you fall.

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.880
Uh-oh.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.880
Oh.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.880
You fall into the dark abyss.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.880
You got it.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880
I found it all room.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.880
It's Goonies.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.880
I thought you were doing a really bad Camel impression.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.880
Wait.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:08.880
Am I dying?

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.880
Is this happening?

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.880
Maybe.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.880
You tumble through darkness until you land in a pile of something.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.880
Is this what happens when you die?

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.880
Until you land in a pile of something squishy, dry, and dusty.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.880
When you land, you feel a great cloud of dust releasing into the air, invading your lungs,

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.880
burning and itching.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.880
Oh.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.880
You cough incessantly for a bit and feel sick and almost immediately.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.880
To no effect, though.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.880
You managed to shake it off.

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.880
Not bad.

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:37.880
All right.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.880
Now, has the wall gone all the way across the room?

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.880
You see the wall for a bit.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.880
It strains as if it's trying to smash something and then you hear a crumpling.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.880
The wall strikes the far wall.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.880
Before you, you can see a giant green mosaic of a dragon.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.880
But in place of its mouth, you only see a dark hole.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.880
So that's the hole that Christopher just fell through?

01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.880
I don't know.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.880
Like you don't know.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880
Oh.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.880
I yell down the hole, Chris, you okay?

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.880
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:06.880
Ah, shit.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:10.880
I wanted to do the thing in the movies where we reveal how we felt about the character

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.880
because we think he's dead.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.880
But I guess he has to come up behind us at the end of that.

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.880
So never mind.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:17.880
Never mind.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.880
Stupid.

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:19.880
We'll do it another time.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.880
So you're in pitch darkness right now.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.880
You can't see a thing.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880
Oh, but I can hear like my buddy.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.880
Definitely.

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.880
Definitely.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.880
Hey, Christopher.

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.880
Hello there.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:28.880
I'm fine.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.880
But I can't see anything, though.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.880
I need those cool glasses that you have.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.880
Actually, does he have?

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:35.880
Maybe.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.880
I light a torch and toss it down into him so he can see his way down there.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.880
You light a torch and toss it down to him so he can see his way down there.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.880
It looks like I can see now.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.880
You just barely managed to catch it.

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.880
Whoa, there I got it.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.880
Okay, so walking through this crazy dark tunnel.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.880
Oh, I should stop you.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.880
You're sitting on what appears to be a giant mushroom.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.880
It's what released this great cloud of dust in the air.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.880
That doesn't sound good.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:09.880
Glancing around quickly, you can see the wall is covered in large fist-sized holes.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:14.880
You can also see a large metal door with a huge, elaborate locking mechanism.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.880
A lot of people get frustrated when they land in a mushroom.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.880
That's why the fist-sized hole.

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.880
You hear hissing.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.880
The sounds of hissing.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.880
Uh-oh.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.880
Uh-oh.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.880
That means snake.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.880
Well, or a tire leak.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.880
Yeah, well, I don't think there's any tires around here.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880
Hey, Christopher.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.880
Yeah, I think there's a snake down here.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.880
If you guys could come down, that'd be great.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.880
Just help me out.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.880
Can you throw us the rope?

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:41.880
Oh, right, right.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:42.880
I have a rope.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:43.880
I have that staff.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.880
I can throw the rope at the button.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.880
Oh, we can climb down the button staff.

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.880
I used the button staff.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.880
Using the button staff, you erect a rope.

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.880
I mean, not a rope.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:52.880
That's stupid.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:53.880
You erect a staff.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.880
It reaches all the way down below.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.880
Nice.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.880
I'm going to grab this staff and ride my way up.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.880
I'm a witch.

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.880
I slide down behind Sharpie, and we both do, like,

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.880
Batman and Robin quips.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.880
Holy mushroom powder Sharpie.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.880
But at some point, we hit Christopher,

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.880
who's coming up, right?

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.880
Well, yeah.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.880
Did you plant the rods so that it was in the mushroom

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.880
or not on the mushroom?

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.880
The floor next to the mushroom.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:25.880
Okay.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:26.880
Then you don't hit him.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.880
Wait, he said he was climbing up the pole.

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.880
Oh, well, then you do hit him.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.880
Ouch.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.880
You're at an impasse.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:34.880
I'm coming up here.

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.880
Well, we're coming down.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.880
Well, I'm coming up.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.880
I don't know if you want to come down,

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.880
because I heard some hissing.

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.880
Could be a snake.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.880
You're coming up?

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.880
I guess so.

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:44.880
Is that cool?

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.880
I guess we better get this party started.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.880
All right.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.880
Fuck you.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:57.880
It was delicious low-hanging fruit.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.880
Well, maybe I'll stay put.

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.880
Yeah, listen, I understand your impulse to come back up,

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.880
because you were previously in a situation

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.880
where you weren't able to come back up,

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.880
so your first instinct is to come up.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.880
But speaking on behalf of the people that were up

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.880
and couldn't come down,

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.880
I'm saying the grass is always greener on the other side,

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.880
vertically or horizontally.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.880
Like, we're coming down.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.880
I suggest you stay down.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.880
I don't get the grass here, though.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.880
Just get down.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.880
I also go down.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:22.880
It's dark.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.880
The combined weight of everyone going down at once

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.880
overcomes.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.880
Guys, we got to start fucking cooperating a little bit.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.880
Especially on ladders.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:35.880
That shit's dangerous.

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:38.880
Well, I thought they were already down.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.880
I think that the way it's painted in my head,

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:42.880
there's a rod.

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.880
Right.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.880
It is standing next to a mushroom.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.880
Yeah.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.880
He's climbing up.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:47.880
Yep.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.880
His face is basically in your underrows.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:50.880
Yep.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.880
And now you two have come atop.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:53.880
Yeah.

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.880
And that's causing the whole assembly

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.880
to slide down slowly to the floor.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.880
Can I use my long, beautiful hair as wings and float down?

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:01.880
Yeah.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.880
It's like a parachute lifted slowly to the ground.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:04.880
Thank you.

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.880
Whoa, guys.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.880
I cast feather fall and get off the pole, too.

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.880
If Christopher wants to go up and, you know,

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.880
go start his music career, you can.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:14.880
All right.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.880
Are we all down by the mushroom?

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.880
That's true.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:18.880
Okay.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.880
So I look around.

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.880
What's going on down there?

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:21.880
You see a wall.

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:22.880
You see, it's a rounded chamber.

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:26.880
Some might say Ovaloid.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:27.880
Some might say what?

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:30.880
There's definitely fist-sized holes dotting the walls.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.880
You can hear the hissing that he was talking about earlier.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:34.880
It's in fact growing stronger.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.880
You know, that hissing is coming from behind the wall.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:39.880
There's also a large metal door.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.880
It's embedded in the wall.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.880
It's the only door you can see.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.880
It has a large elaborate locking mechanism

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.880
and a large keyhole in it.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.880
I got a feeling you hit that lock wrong.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:50.880
Snakes through those holes.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.880
Am I right?

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:52.880
No, man.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.880
Good theory, man.

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:56.880
Well, isn't Christopher, he's good at locks, right?

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:57.880
He's a thief, isn't he?

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880
True.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.880
Yes.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.880
You know, but I don't know if I want to let these snakes out.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.880
Right, so to speak.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.880
It's like a song.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.880
It's not a song, but...

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:08.880
Piss, piss, piss.

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:09.880
I'm not sure.

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:13.880
I mean, to keep things lively, I guess I'll move forward

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.880
and open the lock with my lock skills.

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:16.880
Okay.

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.880
Lock undoing skills.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:18.880
Before you can head to the lock,

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.880
Mulraine, out of the corner of your eye, you can see snakes

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.880
pouring out of a few of the holes to the southwest.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.880
You guys.

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:29.880
Mulraine, don't you have animal husbandry or something?

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.880
Can we just climb back up the staff?

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.880
I do.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.880
I have...

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.880
Actually, I don't know.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.880
You hear a rumbling overhead.

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.880
I have handle animal.

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.880
Can I use handle animal with these snakes?

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.880
I use handle animal.

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.880
I handle the snakes.

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.880
I handle all those animals.

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:52.880
Okay.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.880
And then I pitch a kids' show to Nickelodeon called

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.880
Handle Animals.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.880
You attempt to handle the snake.

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:04.880
It rises up and seems to be swaying slowly from side to side.

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.880
Sexy.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.880
You hear hissing behind you.

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.880
Cool?

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.880
I turn around.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.880
I think they want to dance with you.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.880
You see a few more snakes pouring out of the hole.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.880
Handle animals is what we would need.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.880
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.880
Is this mushroom possibly something we could use in some way?

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.880
I thought at first I should take a bite.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.880
Open the fucking door.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.880
Unlock the door.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.880
I was trying to, but then the snakes started coming out.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.880
Well, that's a lie.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.880
I have a sack.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:35.880
I have a sack.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.880
I take my sack and I hold it up to the holes.

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.880
And I'm also handling the animals.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.880
I handle them into my sack.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.880
I'm going to open the...

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.880
I'm not talking about jerking off, right?

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.880
I'm going to undo the...

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.880
On your skills, there should be something on the other page.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.880
Not that one.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.880
On the right side of this page, there should be something that says open lock,

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.880
and then there should be a number somewhere.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.880
The right side, yeah.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.880
All right.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.880
I'm looking, looking, looking.

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.880
It's 100.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.880
Okay, it's 13.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.880
Awesome.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:04.880
Okay.

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.880
That's small modifier.

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.880
Yeah, 13.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.880
Skill modifier.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.880
You start picking the lock.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.880
It's going to take a bit.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:12.880
Here we go.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.880
As this happens, you guys, you feel,

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.880
you hear the weird sound of sproing floorp.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.880
Sproing floorp.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.880
A green cloud of smoke is emitted from the room

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:23.880
and standing where the snakes were.

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:26.880
You see several green humanoid figures.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.880
They're holding bows.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.880
They're holding bows.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.880
All right.

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.880
What are you doing in our inner sanctum?

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:33.880
I'll handle this.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:34.880
Oh, the snake people.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.880
Oh, fair travelers.

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.880
We come in peace.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:42.880
We have traveled far and wide to give you homage.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.880
We come here only to, to extend to you

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.880
the utmost privilege and courtesy.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.880
Oh, thank God we found you,

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.880
because we've, we've heard about you forever

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.880
and we just, we're just huge fans.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:57.880
Do you have diplomacy, Dan?

01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:58.880
Yeah.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.880
It would be on that first page.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:01.880
I have diplomacy, too.

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:03.880
So do you want to also say stuff?

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:04.880
Yeah, I say I'm with him.

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:07.880
You guys are, thanks for having us.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.880
Can I say something?

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:10.880
I have something to add to this.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.880
Wait, are you done?

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:13.880
Yeah.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.880
Don't kill the lily.

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:15.880
Let's just.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.880
Yeah, let's see what they say.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:18.880
You can go ahead.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:19.880
I was just going to say,

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.880
are there 80s fans?

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.880
I'll play them a song.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.880
Where's diplomacy Spencer on my front page?

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.880
It's on the right side where your skills are.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.880
It's alphabetical.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.880
Oh, okay.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.880
Okay.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.880
Okay.

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.880
I don't.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:31.880
Can I, can I still do it?

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:32.880
You just aren't as good.

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.880
Right.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:34.880
Can I use my how to disguise

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:35.880
and make myself a green person?

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.880
Yeah, definitely.

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.880
Okay.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.880
I do that.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.880
You'll have to do it stealthily

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:40.880
to evade detection.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.880
I do it stealthily.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:42.880
You do it stealthily

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.880
to evade detection.

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.880
Are they threatening us?

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.880
They're holding bows drawn at you.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.880
Well, I'm going to say,

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.880
look, it's your cousin from long afar

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.880
and she misses you guys.

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:57.880
Why haven't you wrote scrolls

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.880
detailing how you're doing to her?

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.880
Actually, they are pointing arrows.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:03.880
I'll tone it down.

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:04.880
Anyway, this is your cousin.

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.880
I can cool it.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.880
Everybody's talking at once.

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.880
It doesn't seem very convincing.

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.880
But then, I take my emerald green dagger

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.880
and I go over to Mulraine disguised

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:16.880
as one of these green people

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:17.880
and I say, Mulraine, this is not going

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:18.880
to be what it looks like.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:19.880
I'm going to pretend that we're

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.880
holding you as a hostage

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.880
because you look like one of them.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:22.880
But I'm not going to do anything bad.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.880
So I put my dagger up to Mulraine

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.880
so I'm going to go,

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.880
hey, open that door and let us through

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.880
or your friend gets it.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:30.880
He means it.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.880
You hear the voice of the dagger call out.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.880
Hey, hey, snake dudes.

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.880
This guy's totally lying.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.880
It's a trick.

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:37.880
That dagger, man.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.880
Why would my dagger do that?

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.880
Because it's an intelligent item.

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:42.880
Okay, I put the dagger away.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.880
I take a sword out.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.880
It doesn't talk back.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.880
That's true.

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.880
Okay, I take my sword out.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:53.880
That's the thing I got at a Renaissance fair.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.880
Anywho, I take my sword out

01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.880
and I hold it up to Mulraine disguised

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.880
and I say, hey, open that door.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:03.880
Open that door.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.880
Your friend gets it.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.880
What's your diplomacy, Jeff?

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.880
My diplomacy is 10 with a 3 and a 7.

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:13.880
With a minor in theology.

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.880
This is 10, then 3, then 7, whatever that means.

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:18.880
Yeah, okay.

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.880
That makes sense.

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.880
Oh, so it's math.

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880
Okay.

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.880
Sometimes it's math.

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.880
Yeah.

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.880
You seem convincing.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.880
The lead snake person mulls over the options.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.880
I use Intimidate, too.

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:32.880
Well, you gotta pick one.

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.880
So diplomacy or Intimidate?

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.880
Ah, shit.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:36.880
Intimidate.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:37.880
Intimidate.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:38.880
Okay.

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.880
He stops for it and he's like, wait a second.

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.880
You shouldn't kill one of our own.

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.880
Probably.

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.880
Also, I'm frightened.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.880
Oh, snake people.

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.880
Oh, so superior because your backs bend

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:57.880
in different ways.

01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:00.880
We of the primates just come to pay honor to you

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.880
for your blood runs cold and your hearts are but two chambers.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.880
Or maybe even one, I can't remember.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.880
It's true, brethren.

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.880
I came upon them.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.880
They were making posters paying homage to our people.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.880
We're just here to hang out.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.880
We love lizard people.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.880
He seems lizard people, yeah.

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.880
That was bad, right?

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.880
Yeah, no, that's insulting, in fact.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.880
Oh, no.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.880
He seems a bit enamored by your speech

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:31.880
after being frightened by the known barbarians.

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:34.880
We got to get in the same page here, you guys.

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.880
We're sending mixed messages.

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.880
But the snake man to the left, he looks a bit unstable.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:44.880
He freaks out and he hits the one in the middle.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.880
Fuck it, that happened.

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.880
They're hitting each other?

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.880
One of the guys, he jabs them sharply in the ribs.

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.880
He's like, hey, get a friggin' grip.

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.880
Oh, I see.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.880
Let's keep it safe.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.880
Safe to work.

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.880
Oh, look at this guy over here.

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.880
I walk over to him, go, what's with this guy, huh?

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.880
I walk around, I go, before that happens,

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.880
the one on the left says, hey, hold it, hold it, hold it.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:08.880
No, no, no, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.880
I'm just saying, let's get along.

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:18.880
I'm relying on my elongated S's to woo them into...

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880
Pretty tricky.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:23.880
Hey, everybody, let's just say we're just here to

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.880
service the idea of getting along.

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.880
While he's doing that, I walk around one of the

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.880
agitated snake guy and I get down on my hands and knees

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.880
like a Hopin' Crosby kind of thing.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:42.880
At the end of the days, all we are is just a bunch of

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.880
slaves to work it for the weekend and I push them.

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.880
Uh-oh.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:51.880
For a second, you don't think this half-ass plan is going to work.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:56.880
But Quark, being naturally sneaky, manages to crawl into position.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.880
Thinking fast or whatever you had mentioned, you push him over Quark.

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.880
All right, you see what happened there?

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:06.880
The rest of you, following the fucking liner, will trip you too.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.880
They shoot arrows at you.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.880
Uh...

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:10.880
I...

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.880
The arrows hit and you feel a bit woozy.

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:17.880
If there was something coating the poison in those arrows.

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:18.880
Uh-oh.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:19.880
Oh, no.

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.880
Tricky business indeed.

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880
Who was hit, Spencer?

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:22.880
It hit...

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.880
Both of the arrows hit Dan.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.880
Oh.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.880
Oh, no.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.880
I like fire flames in my eyes.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.880
I take out my arrows.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:39.880
I fire two arrows at the snake people and they're looking at me like,

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:40.880
What?

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:41.880
You're one of a...

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.880
But I do it.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.880
Nice.

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.880
So what kind of arrows?

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.880
Perfect ones?

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:51.880
Obsidian.

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:52.880
Obsidian.

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880
Vieros.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.880
Vieros.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880
With a woody feel.

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.880
The Vieros.

01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.880
The cedar.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:58.880
Oh, cedar.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.880
Okay.

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:00.880
I fire two Vieros.

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.880
Okay, so are you shooting them at one person or two people?

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:05.880
I'm the two most dangerous.

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:06.880
Two people.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:07.880
Okay, so you fire at them.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.880
Two people.

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:09.880
Yes.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.880
Both of their arrows strike their mark.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.880
All right.

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:13.880
Oh, nice.

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.880
Quite the archer art you are, you know?

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.880
Your regular green arrow.

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.880
Thank you.

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.880
One of them takes seven damage, the other three.

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.880
I stand up into a flaming sword attack on the other snake person.

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.880
Leaping quickly to your feet.

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.880
You grab your sword and thrust it viciously into the...

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.880
Which one did you say?

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.880
The one that we knocked over, the one that's on the ground.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.880
The knocked over one.

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.880
With my loot or mandolin, whatever, can I score the whole action scene?

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880
Is there doing all that?

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880
Do you have a loot?

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.880
If you do, it should be.

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.880
You could, potentially.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:50.880
Or you could get in the fucking fight, Christopher.

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:53.880
No, I mean, I just want...

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.880
Yeah, I mean, all right.

01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:00.880
I'll help my homie out and, you know, claw him on the head or something.

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.880
Yeah, I'll use my bow and shoot arrows also.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:04.880
All right, well...

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.880
At the last guy?

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:11.880
Quark with his, you know, his flaming sword strikes the fallen snake.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:12.880
He dies.

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:13.880
Oh, yeah.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.880
Nice.

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:15.880
Great job.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:16.880
See, that's so hard.

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:17.880
Yeah.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.880
You dealt 19 damage.

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:19.880
Okay.

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:20.880
Quite a feat.

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:21.880
Oh, man.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.880
Do we get, like, points and shit?

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.880
Experience ones, yes.

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.880
Yeah, that's cool.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.880
Okay, so now do the thing that you're going to do.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.880
Wait, divided among us or does he get them all?

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.880
Oh, it's divided.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.880
Don't you worry.

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:32.880
Yeah.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.880
I'll take care of you.

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:34.880
That's cool, man.

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:35.880
I got some points.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.880
You were going to do something, though, with a bow, maybe?

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:38.880
What was it?

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:39.880
Me?

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:40.880
Yeah.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.880
Oh, well, there's nothing left to do.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:42.880
No, no, no.

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.880
There's two other guys.

01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:44.880
Well, I will shoot.

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:48.880
I got to divide experience points with this guy.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.880
I'm going to, sorry.

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.880
I'm going to, like, shoot one, like, really fast, like, one bow, one guy, one bow with

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:55.880
the other guy.

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:56.880
I mean, arrow.

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.880
Okay, so you can almost shoot one arrow.

01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.380
I stand behind Chris and I cross my arms and I nod my head as if I taught him everything

01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:01.880
he knows, but I know I didn't.

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:02.880
But it looks like I did.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.880
Well, you can shoot one arrow, so pick a target.

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:06.880
Left or right?

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:07.880
Oh, okay.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:09.880
I mean, I guess you always go left.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:10.880
Well, maybe right.

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:11.880
I'll go left.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.880
I'll go left.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.880
My first answer seems right, yeah, yeah.

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:18.880
Your arrow strikes true, hitting the snake right in the chest.

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:19.880
Oh, yeah.

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:20.880
Ah.

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:22.880
It deals 10 damage.

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:23.880
All right.

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.880
The snake goes down.

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:31.880
The other snake freaks out and turns into a snake, an actual snake this time.

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.880
And slithers away into the hole behind.

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:34.880
Ah.

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:35.880
I want to stop him.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.880
Do you want to try and stop him?

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.880
Yeah, I want to grab him.

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:40.880
What's your dexterity?

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.880
Well, that's not looking good, man.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.880
14 plus 2, it says.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.880
Plus 2, yeah.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.880
He manages to worm away.

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:48.880
Me.

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.880
I whip him.

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.880
It's too heavy.

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:52.880
I like your thought.

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:53.880
Can I make a go at it?

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:54.880
I whip him.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:55.880
I use my whip.

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:56.880
Okay.

01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:57.880
Your magical whip.

01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:58.880
Okay.

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:02.880
So it's going to take a minor action, and then you whip.

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.880
You miss, so, well, there you go.

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:09.880
Chris, while we were fighting these people, did you have any luck opening that door?

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:10.880
That's true.

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.880
In this time, the door has now been unlocked.

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:14.880
Ah.

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.880
I earned some points there.

01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:17.880
Where am I keep?

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:20.880
I open the door and peer through it.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.880
You peer through the open door.

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.880
No, what's happening?

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:31.880
As you open the door to the threshold, you are assaulted by the sharp abrasive smell of the chamber air.

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:34.880
Thick and heavy, but clawing at your eyes and nose.

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:39.880
A sharp tang of vinegar and incredibly pungent sour aroma invades your senses.

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.880
Well, we're at the drawing room.

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:49.880
You can see a large stone chamber in the center of which is three large humanoid statues that are beginning to crumble.

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:55.880
Next, behind the statues is a large staircase leading up about 80 feet high in tiered steps.

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.880
At the top, you can see chests and barrels and what appear to be a massive sarcophagus

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:04.880
made of obsidian surrounded by several forms of tribute.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.880
Gold heaps of gold.

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.880
Rich!

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:12.880
I turn into Sharpie and I start to do a high five and go, not again!

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:15.880
It's in the way that you use it!

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.880
And credit starts to roll.

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:18.880
Freeze frame.

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.880
We'll divvy up that treasure.

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.880
Cliffhanger!

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.880
Spencer, everybody, once again.

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:29.880
Erin McGathy!

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:30.880
Abed Gheith.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.880
Abed Gheith.

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.880
Abed Tiny Food Gaith.

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:38.880
Thank you, Abed.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.880
Enjoy those fashion beasts.

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:41.880
I will.

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.880
I'll let you know what it's like.

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:44.880
That was an alright show.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.880
I'll give that a Burbank 8.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:49.880
A Burbank 8?

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:51.880
Yeah, you know, Burbank, you know, lower it, you know.

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.880
Like, you know.

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.880
Oh, what the fuck?

01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:57.880
Oh, shit!

01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:58.880
Wait.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:31:59.880
God damn it.

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:03.880
This is going to be hard to describe with the podcast listeners.

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.880
An apparition just appeared on stage.

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.880
It's our good friend BJ, everybody.

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:14.880
BJ, briefly, briefly for the people listening in Indiana and whatnot.

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:18.880
BJ comes on stage wearing pink leopard or cheetah jaguar?

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:19.880
What is that?

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.880
Trousers.

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:21.880
It's a pink leopard.

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:23.880
Pink leopard trousers.

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:25.880
It's got rainbow bright moon boots.

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.880
Yeah, punky broosters, giant shoes.

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:28.880
Yeah, thank you.

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:33.880
They're not strawberry shortcake boots, as previously said by someone not here.

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:38.880
And there's a red tartan jacket, open shirt, hairy chest, a colorful scarf.

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:40.880
BJ, how should we end the show?

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:48.880
I traveled back all the way from the future just to figure out how to end this show.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.880
How about with a song?

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.880
What's the future like, BJ?

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:53.880
Yeah.

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.880
It's bright.

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.880
Because the sun's bigger?

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.880
There's more than one.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:32:59.880
Oh, there's two suns?

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:01.880
Two suns in the future.

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.880
One of them is ours.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.880
Who does the other sun belong to?

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:12.880
The other sun belongs to Jeff.

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.880
And Jeff has a son.

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.880
Jeff has a son in the future.

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.880
Jeff has a son in the future.

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.880
A son in the future.

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.880
Jeff's son from the future.

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.880
I got my own son in the future.

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.880
It's me, dad.

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:26.880
BJ's your son.

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:27.880
That's who I was all along.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.880
BJ is Jeff's son.

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.880
In the future, BJ is Jeff's son.

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:33.880
This is as far as I can get because of the cord.

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:36.880
Jeff's story has just begun.

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:37.880
Sorry, technology.

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.880
In the future, BJ is Jeff's son.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.880
Okay, thanks for catching me.

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.880
And Jeff adopted himself.

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.880
People from the present?

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.880
He put his sperm on a shelf.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:51.880
He impregnated himself and BJ is the resultant answer.

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.880
Wait, so I have a son that lives in the future?

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.880
Yes.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.880
And he's part you?

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:57.880
Part you.

01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.880
There is no woman involved.

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:00.880
You finally achieved your dream.

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.880
In the future, it's possible for you to have your dream.

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.880
You can procreate without having to involve any woman.

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:09.880
But how does he go to the future and come back now?

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.880
Because he's part you and part you, he's so smart he can invent time travel.

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:16.880
But is he also a stellar body?

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.880
There's two sons.

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.880
One is the actual star that we call our son.

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:27.880
He is your son and his wardrobe choices are so radiant that he actually is defined as a solar body.

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:28.880
So he's the future me?

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:29.880
Yeah.

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:30.880
I throw up the shackles.

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:31.880
And the future you?

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:32.880
I throw up the suits.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.880
Yeah.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:37.880
The future you is a star.

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:40.880
Just like the sun.

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.880
And the future you likes to drink just like you because drinking is so much fun.

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.880
I love my future gay son.

01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:57.880
Thank you for coming to Harmontown everybody.

01:34:57.880 --> 01:34:59.880
Thank you BJ.

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:00.880
Thank you.

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:05.880
Thank you Dustin Marshall, Zac McKeever, and Emily Gordon, Jenny Fine.

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.880
Also Jeremy for coming up on stage earlier on.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.880
Hello our drunken Scottish friend.

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.880
Hoppet, Gaith, Erin McAfee.

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:18.880
My foam sword is shiny and sharp.

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.880
I fight you mama like life guarding the garb.

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.880
I fight you mama in Harmontown all day.

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.880
Jeff's son's already gay.

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:31.880
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:34.880
One more time for Dan Harmon everybody.

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:40.880
Harmontown, I fight you mama in Harmontown.

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.880
I fight you mama.

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.880
I fight you mama on a plate in a bowl.

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:49.880
I fight you mama tell her face got a mole.

01:35:49.880 --> 01:36:05.880
I fight you mama dermatologically speaking.
