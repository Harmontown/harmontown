WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:25.500
8 o'clock already I was just in the middle of a dream

00:25.500 --> 00:31.500
Harmontown is now in session, let me hear all my harmonians scream

00:31.500 --> 00:38.500
Oh shit! It's Monday nights, we're at the Meltdown Theater in Hollywood, California

00:38.500 --> 00:41.500
Harmontown is once again in session, you lucky devils

00:41.500 --> 00:46.500
Won't you please walk into the stage of the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon

00:46.500 --> 01:02.500
Thank you, Jeff. Jeff Davis, your Comptroller. That's an interesting choice, sir

01:02.500 --> 01:06.500
Opening music, we referenced it inadvertently last week, do you remember?

01:06.500 --> 01:07.500
I don't.

01:07.500 --> 01:20.500
Oh no, DC Pearson's episode, when he was a guest, I said, God damn it, I don't know, somebody I told them I was lost in their eyes and was kissing them by a crystal blue Italian stream

01:20.500 --> 01:27.500
I was driving here in my car and I had my whole iPod on shuffle and that came up and I was like, I've never started the show with Manic Monday

01:27.500 --> 01:29.500
Manic Monday, yeah

01:29.500 --> 01:41.500
The podcast probably airs around Thursday, but for these people here tonight, it's another hopefully Manic Monday, they need a little mania to keep them awake because tomorrow is Tuesday and they've got shit to do

01:41.500 --> 01:52.500
But you're shit out of luck because I just got over a three or four day cold, I don't know if you can hear my David Duchovny, Willie Nelson congestion

01:52.500 --> 02:01.500
But yeah, I've been sitting in bed watching Gene Hackman movies for four days by a crystal blue Italian stream

02:01.500 --> 02:12.500
Only Gene Hackman? Well, I went on a little Gene Hackman bender, I watched Night Moves, I've never seen Night Moves, it was nice, this is a scene where he's laying face down

02:12.500 --> 02:27.500
This could only happen in the 70s, it just cuts to Gene Hackman naked, just finished bone in his ex-wife and he's laying face down and there's a fondue pot in front of him and he's naked and he's got his foot on her tit

02:27.500 --> 02:36.500
Sorry, let me explain, she's sitting against the headboard like sitting up in bed and Gene Hackman is laying face down

02:36.500 --> 02:42.500
And there's a fondue at the foot of the bed, so there's a pot in front of the camera

02:42.500 --> 02:43.500
That sounds like a real hazard

02:43.500 --> 02:48.500
If this was in 3D, the first thing in front of your face that you would reach out in touch would be a fondue pot

02:48.500 --> 02:54.500
The second thing would be Gene Hackman, the third thing would be his foot and the fourth thing right under that would be this woman's tit

02:54.500 --> 02:59.500
And he's just got a big smile on his face and he's solving a murder case

02:59.500 --> 03:09.500
My parents had a lot of sexy 70s, early 80s fondue parties, was this hot oil and meat or was this cheese?

03:09.500 --> 03:12.500
I was dying to know whether it was chocolate or cheese

03:12.500 --> 03:18.500
The whole scene, you could tell that it was a situation where the actor just asked for some business

03:18.500 --> 03:21.500
I have a feeling the fondue pot was requested by the actor

03:21.500 --> 03:29.500
And I have a feeling it was empty and I think he just sat there and played with something on a stick and then played with her tit with his foot

03:29.500 --> 03:33.500
You almost destroyed the vodka

03:33.500 --> 03:37.500
It's another manic Monday, whatever

03:37.500 --> 03:43.500
We got off to a slow start and we're going to have a slow middle and then we're going to end the show very slowly

03:43.500 --> 03:45.500
Maybe we should start off with a bang then

03:45.500 --> 03:51.500
Because I kind of can't, I have that congestion where you can't, I don't even know if anyone can hear me

03:51.500 --> 03:53.500
You know what I mean?

03:53.500 --> 03:57.500
This sounds, this will make people angry

03:57.500 --> 03:59.500
Imagine what it's like to be deaf

03:59.500 --> 04:01.500
No, probably not, I don't think

04:01.500 --> 04:03.500
But I mean as close as I can get

04:03.500 --> 04:07.500
You're kind of talking out into nothingness

04:07.500 --> 04:11.500
And that's good, they brought the lights up more to compensate for my lack of other senses

04:11.500 --> 04:14.500
I'm like daredevil

04:14.500 --> 04:16.500
It should be the other way around

04:16.500 --> 04:18.500
Your lack of hearing should heighten your vision right now

04:18.500 --> 04:20.500
Everything should be the other way around

04:20.500 --> 04:26.500
Jeff, which is a segue into a favorite segment called Things Dan Harmon Has to Complain About

04:26.500 --> 04:29.500
That he's afraid to complain about because it'll make him sound like a bad person

04:29.500 --> 04:31.500
Thank you

04:31.500 --> 04:46.500
I have 5,000 Facebook friends, which makes my calendar very unmanageable

04:46.500 --> 04:48.500
There's a lot of settings that I don't understand

04:48.500 --> 04:51.500
My Google Calendar and my Facebook are somehow interwoven

04:51.500 --> 04:55.500
And I'm 40 and I'm not going to put the time into figuring it out anymore

04:55.500 --> 04:59.500
So I just have this calendar, I just go, do I have anything going on today?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.500
And the answer is always yes, it'll just say

05:01.500 --> 05:05.500
Ah, Chip and Simmons' dating hour, is it UCB?

05:05.500 --> 05:07.500
What?

05:07.500 --> 05:11.500
Oh, it's Maggie Molina's birthday, what?

05:11.500 --> 05:14.500
I don't, that's my complaint, 5,000

05:20.500 --> 05:23.500
I'm trying to punctuate this as best I can, man

05:23.500 --> 05:27.500
I'm trying to show biz up this bit a little bit

05:27.500 --> 05:31.500
There's gotta be some checkbook, checkbox, there's gotta be some checkbook

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
I can make a check out to Facebook

05:33.500 --> 05:36.500
There's gotta be a checkbox somewhere where it says, like, yeah, sure

05:36.500 --> 05:41.500
Every time someone has an improv show that is on my Facebook thing

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
I don't want that on my Google Calendar

05:43.500 --> 05:47.500
I just, I feel so fucking old, and I'm not complaining about that

05:47.500 --> 05:52.500
It's just amazing, I've said this before, I remember my grandpa before

05:52.500 --> 05:57.500
After he killed the Japanese for our country

05:57.500 --> 06:00.500
And after he drove a truck, and after he blew up in an oil tank

06:00.500 --> 06:03.500
And after he did a million amazing things

06:03.500 --> 06:10.500
Right before he died of emphysema, he was the treasurer for his Freemason club

06:10.500 --> 06:14.500
And he had a little, little Mac, a little tiny Mac

06:14.500 --> 06:19.500
And he was just, like, using his little skin grafted hand to, like, learn, like, quicken

06:19.500 --> 06:23.500
And he would get so frustrated with the goddamn fucking computer

06:23.500 --> 06:27.500
Goddammit, Danny, can you tell me how the goddamn spreadsheet works?

06:27.500 --> 06:31.500
And I would go, I actually, I don't, I'm not sure, well, go up to think

06:31.500 --> 06:34.500
But I remember thinking to my head, like, ah, grandpa, come on, don't try to use a computer

06:34.500 --> 06:40.500
And I'm not, I'm not that much, like, it's, it's, it's, you can, technology's moving faster now

06:40.500 --> 06:44.500
So I'm pretty much, I think I'm exactly where my grandpa was right before he died

06:44.500 --> 06:48.500
In terms of, like, understanding goddamn computers

06:48.500 --> 06:50.500
It's not exciting to talk about

06:50.500 --> 06:51.500
Was that one of them?

06:51.500 --> 06:54.500
No, no, that's something I'm allowed to, not allowed to complain about

06:54.500 --> 06:56.500
Because it'll make people think I'm boring

06:56.500 --> 06:57.500
Sorry

06:58.500 --> 07:00.500
Alright, there's only one more item in this segment

07:00.500 --> 07:06.500
Uh, uh, the, uh, professional puppy, uh, uh, that, that I'm, uh, breeding

07:06.500 --> 07:07.500
Through a professional puppy breeder

07:07.500 --> 07:09.500
You're breeding a professional puppy?

07:09.500 --> 07:10.500
Yeah

07:10.500 --> 07:14.500
It's, it's gonna pull down 20k a year

07:14.500 --> 07:16.500
Uh, just licking its balls

07:16.500 --> 07:19.500
What, what, oh yeah, so you say, what line of work is this puppy gonna go into?

07:19.500 --> 07:20.500
Hanging out

07:20.500 --> 07:23.500
Uh, now it's, uh, we went, we went through a breeder

07:23.500 --> 07:25.500
This is why I'm not allowed to complain about it

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
Because you're supposed to rescue your pets

07:26.500 --> 07:27.500
And I don't want to talk about it

07:27.500 --> 07:29.500
But, uh, it's for my cat

07:29.500 --> 07:32.500
My aides having cat, that, that, that is a rescue cat

07:32.500 --> 07:37.500
Just because your cat has aides doesn't make you buying a purebred dog, you know

07:37.500 --> 07:38.500
Any cooler

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
No, it doesn't make it cooler, but it makes it permissible

07:40.500 --> 07:45.500
Because I can't bring a three-legged, one-eyed, fucked-up Ukrainian dog into the house

07:45.500 --> 07:48.500
With, with my aides cat hanging out

07:48.500 --> 07:52.500
Whose, whose immune system, which is linked to stress and territory

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
Cats are territorial

07:53.500 --> 07:56.500
She's, she's, she, I don't know how much longer she has to live

07:56.500 --> 07:59.500
I know it's her house, it's her rules, I love her

07:59.500 --> 08:02.500
She was there first, she's a rescue cat

08:02.500 --> 08:04.500
I'm not gonna bring some maniac into the house

08:04.500 --> 08:05.500
Dogs are all maniacs

08:05.500 --> 08:09.500
Well, not little pity puppies that come in a little pity puppy box

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
That, that

08:10.500 --> 08:11.500
If she

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
Puppies don't come in a box, damn

08:12.500 --> 08:17.500
If she's there when the box is open, if she comes swatted on the head and assert dominance

08:17.500 --> 08:20.500
It's the safest route to go, okay

08:20.500 --> 08:23.500
And I'm not gonna go to a weird, one of those weird Korea town puppy stores

08:23.500 --> 08:25.500
Where the puppies are in the fish tank or whatever

08:28.500 --> 08:34.500
I went through a respectable breeder who's breeding a healthy, a healthy hybrid

08:34.500 --> 08:36.500
When is, when is a dog gonna come in?

08:36.500 --> 08:37.500
When does the box arrive?

08:37.500 --> 08:40.500
A couple, a couple months now, there's the different stages

08:40.500 --> 08:44.500
They were just born, the mother just gave birth to 13 puppies

08:44.500 --> 08:45.500
13 puppy litter

08:46.500 --> 08:47.500
That's bad luck, you know

08:49.500 --> 08:51.500
Bad luck for the 13th puppy, yeah

08:52.500 --> 08:53.500
Cause there's only 12 nipples

08:55.500 --> 08:56.500
Look it up

08:58.500 --> 08:59.500
It's probably like six

09:03.500 --> 09:07.500
But, but, but the dog nipples are dichotomous

09:07.500 --> 09:09.500
They have two openings on them

09:09.500 --> 09:11.500
So for a maximum of 12 dogs

09:11.500 --> 09:12.500
That's also not true

09:18.500 --> 09:20.500
I'm assuming they would tell us in the email

09:20.500 --> 09:26.500
They send us ultrasounds, like we could see little dog skeletons in the larger dog skeleton

09:27.500 --> 09:29.500
And then they, I'm assuming they would tell us

09:29.500 --> 09:33.500
A lot of times, especially with a larger litter, there's some tragedies

09:33.500 --> 09:35.500
You know, with cats and dogs

09:35.500 --> 09:36.500
There's a stillborn

09:36.500 --> 09:38.500
Yeah, I'm assuming they would tell us

09:38.500 --> 09:42.500
So 13 newborn puppies without a single tragedy is really, that's a lucky dog

09:42.500 --> 09:44.500
What sort of dog are you getting?

09:44.500 --> 09:47.500
It's a half golden retriever, half poodle

09:47.500 --> 09:49.500
And what do you call it?

09:49.500 --> 09:52.500
A retriever maximus

09:54.500 --> 09:55.500
Golden doodle

09:59.500 --> 10:01.500
You don't have to call it that

10:03.500 --> 10:05.500
Have you got a name for it?

10:05.500 --> 10:08.500
No, no, we're gonna let that happen organically

10:09.500 --> 10:11.500
As organic as ordering a dog, huh?

10:14.500 --> 10:17.500
Are you getting lots of shit from people for not rescuing a dog?

10:17.500 --> 10:19.500
No, no, just a couple people initially

10:19.500 --> 10:22.500
But now I've learned to walk around with a giant asterisk

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500
And cut everyone off at the pass

10:24.500 --> 10:27.500
And be a big, you know, bore people with

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
Before you say anything

10:30.500 --> 10:32.500
My cat has AIDS

10:32.500 --> 10:35.500
Yeah, exactly

10:35.500 --> 10:37.500
By the way, my cat, I don't know if...

10:37.500 --> 10:40.500
My cat has no name, my cat's name is Fivian, F-I-V

10:40.500 --> 10:42.500
Because when we rescued my cat

10:42.500 --> 10:45.500
We were told, the vet said, it has F-I-V

10:45.500 --> 10:47.500
What's that? It's like HIV, but for cats

10:47.500 --> 10:50.500
Oh, shit, we rescued a cat that's like

10:50.500 --> 10:54.500
We're gonna just spend the last act of a Julia Roberts movie with this thing

10:54.500 --> 10:56.500
Let's not name it

10:56.500 --> 10:58.500
Like, let's let it, let's just love it

10:58.500 --> 11:00.500
And let it live its wildlife

11:00.500 --> 11:02.500
You know, and we'll feed it

11:02.500 --> 11:04.500
And we'll let it kind of shuffle off to Buffalo

11:04.500 --> 11:08.500
And Buffalo is where I believe you go when you die

11:10.500 --> 11:12.500
So where you get your wings

11:12.500 --> 11:14.500
And so it's like 13 years later or something

11:14.500 --> 11:17.500
And the cat's name is Fiv, F-I-V

11:19.500 --> 11:22.500
It happens, it never happens with human beings, but it happens

11:22.500 --> 11:25.500
Speaking of death, let's keep the theme of death going

11:25.500 --> 11:28.500
I want to bring up a special friend

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
Who comes here very often, who's very interesting

11:30.500 --> 11:33.500
And we should have often talked to him

11:33.500 --> 11:37.500
And I just, shit, we got a lot of people that fit that category

11:37.500 --> 11:40.500
I just realized I perked up like six people

11:40.500 --> 11:43.500
I want to bring up Brian W. Collins

11:43.500 --> 11:45.500
Is he here? Brian, are you here? No

11:45.500 --> 11:46.500
Okay, that's good actually

11:46.500 --> 11:50.500
Okay, you know why? Because we have a replacement form

11:50.500 --> 11:51.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah

11:51.500 --> 12:00.500
Doug Benson, everybody, welcome Doug Benson

12:00.500 --> 12:01.500
Sure, yeah

12:01.500 --> 12:04.500
Hey, everybody

12:04.500 --> 12:06.500
What were you going to talk to him about?

12:06.500 --> 12:08.500
I'll just talk about that with you

12:08.500 --> 12:11.500
Can you pretend you just ended your blot

12:11.500 --> 12:14.500
Where you watch a horror movie a day?

12:14.500 --> 12:17.500
Oh, it was tough to get through, but I did it, Dan

12:17.500 --> 12:20.500
And I'm happy to be here and talk about it

12:20.500 --> 12:22.500
But you actually, that's not even that ironic

12:22.500 --> 12:24.500
Because you do Doug loves movies

12:24.500 --> 12:25.500
I do love movies

12:25.500 --> 12:26.500
You're a guy who can talk to you about movies

12:26.500 --> 12:27.500
Sure

12:27.500 --> 12:29.500
I just saw Wreck-It Ralph, have you seen that?

12:29.500 --> 12:30.500
Yeah

12:30.500 --> 12:32.500
Did you?

12:32.500 --> 12:37.500
You guys heard of this thing?

12:37.500 --> 12:39.500
Yeah, I love it, I love it

12:39.500 --> 12:41.500
I saw it last November when it came out

12:41.500 --> 12:47.500
And everybody, I really ate it up

12:47.500 --> 12:50.500
My podcast is called Dan likes movies, kind of

12:50.500 --> 12:52.500
Dan gets around to movies

12:52.500 --> 12:55.500
Dan likes some of his screeners

12:55.500 --> 12:58.500
Dan has Netflix

12:58.500 --> 13:01.500
Dan gets sick every once a year

13:01.500 --> 13:03.500
It got me, man, I was bawling like a maniac

13:03.500 --> 13:07.500
Oh, you watched it during the, you took a break from Gene Hackman to watch Wreck-It Ralph?

13:07.500 --> 13:09.500
I just watched it today with my girlfriend, yeah

13:09.500 --> 13:11.500
It killed me, God, it got me good

13:11.500 --> 13:13.500
What do you think Gene Hackman looks like?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.500
Just not to change the subject on you

13:15.500 --> 13:19.500
What do you think he looks like right now?

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
When was Welcome to Mooseport?

13:21.500 --> 13:24.500
Which should not be his last movie, first of all

13:24.500 --> 13:26.500
That was Ray Romano, right?

13:26.500 --> 13:27.500
Yeah

13:27.500 --> 13:29.500
I didn't see that, I didn't see him in the trailer, so I don't even have that

13:29.500 --> 13:33.500
He did Ten and Bombs, which is not only a great movie, but his performance is amazing

13:33.500 --> 13:37.500
And then, Welcome to Mooseport, was this Swan Song?

13:37.500 --> 13:40.500
Do you think he's on Hard Health or something?

13:40.500 --> 13:42.500
I just think he, well, is he shattering?

13:42.500 --> 13:47.500
To completely stop acting, and he doesn't even do voiceovers for Lowe's or whatever it was he was doing

13:47.500 --> 13:48.500
Oh, yeah

13:48.500 --> 13:52.500
So I think he's like, remember when Henry Fonda showed up and on Golden Pond, and it was like

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
Holy fuck, what happened to him?

13:54.500 --> 13:57.500
Because he didn't do a movie for 10 years, and then he showed up crazy old?

13:57.500 --> 13:59.500
When's Gene Hackman gonna do that?

13:59.500 --> 14:00.500
Yeah

14:00.500 --> 14:01.500
Is my question

14:01.500 --> 14:03.500
Well, it seems like he's been doing that since the 70s

14:03.500 --> 14:06.500
I mean, he's sort of like the Betty White of men

14:06.500 --> 14:12.500
In the 70s, which was cool, like I was showing my girlfriend, like we went on this kick of like

14:12.500 --> 14:16.500
Let's watch 70s movies, because she's 29, 28?

14:16.500 --> 14:18.500
Aaron, what did you just turn?

14:18.500 --> 14:19.500
28

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
Hi, Aaron

14:21.500 --> 14:23.500
I thought you said bye, Aaron, because it was like, yeah

14:23.500 --> 14:24.500
See ya

14:24.500 --> 14:25.500
What color are your eyes?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.500
Get out of here, Joggin

14:27.500 --> 14:34.500
I was explaining to her like, man, look at Donald Sutherland, look at him

14:34.500 --> 14:38.500
Look at Donald Sutherland, he was a leading man, he was a sex symbol in the 70s

14:38.500 --> 14:40.500
That's how few people on the planet there were

14:40.500 --> 14:42.500
It was just an amazing time

14:42.500 --> 14:46.500
He and Elliot Gould, you're the top two movie stars

14:46.500 --> 14:47.500
And who else? Who else?

14:47.500 --> 14:48.500
Alan Arkin

14:48.500 --> 14:52.500
Like, yeah, god damn it, well there was somebody who was in a Raymond Chandler like thing

14:52.500 --> 14:55.500
Was it Elliot Gould? Yeah, I think it was Elliot Gould, it was like The Long Goodnight or something

14:55.500 --> 14:56.500
Yeah, yeah

14:56.500 --> 14:57.500
God damn it, long goodbye

14:57.500 --> 14:59.500
It was The Long Something

14:59.500 --> 15:05.500
And there was, god, it was like guys like your dad, there was like guys with beards and checkered shirts

15:05.500 --> 15:07.500
And I longed for those days

15:07.500 --> 15:11.500
Like to, well you're bringing it back

15:11.500 --> 15:18.500
Like to go back to the, make a brief stop in the 80s and be a rap sensation by rhyming me with free

15:18.500 --> 15:22.500
And saying ha ha ha ha ha for the rest of the lyrics

15:22.500 --> 15:26.500
But then straight back to the 70s where I would be a sex symbol

15:26.500 --> 15:30.500
Just for a little bit, like a horror movie, I'd be like that lumberjack that came by

15:30.500 --> 15:32.500
I was like, what's going on, what's the problem?

15:32.500 --> 15:37.500
The mercury poisoning is making bears bigger, I'll check it out

15:37.500 --> 15:40.500
But first I'm gonna fuck her and her

15:40.500 --> 15:43.500
Then I'm gonna wrestle that bear

15:43.500 --> 15:46.500
So I watched one horror movie a day, is that what I did?

15:46.500 --> 15:47.500
Yeah, yeah, you did

15:47.500 --> 15:48.500
And then I wrote a blog about it

15:48.500 --> 15:52.500
Your name's Brian W. Collins, I think your blog is probably called horrormovieaday.com

15:52.500 --> 15:54.500
I'm gonna assume, does anyone know that that's true?

15:54.500 --> 15:55.500
Yeah

15:55.500 --> 15:57.500
That's Brian Collins' lawyer

15:57.500 --> 16:01.500
And does he love all of them? Or is he critical of them?

16:01.500 --> 16:08.500
I think it's safe to say he's a huge fan of the genre in general to the point where he's willing to tolerate warts and all

16:08.500 --> 16:10.500
That he recognizes good ones and bad ones

16:10.500 --> 16:11.500
There's a lot of warts in that genre

16:11.500 --> 16:15.500
Doug, what is your movie schedule? Like how do you intake that many movies?

16:15.500 --> 16:17.500
Are you always in the theaters?

16:17.500 --> 16:21.500
No, I just have them implanted in my brain

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
Yeah, right now I'm watching Brave

16:23.500 --> 16:28.500
Oh, I cried finally getting around to that

16:28.500 --> 16:31.500
When the bear eats the salmon, fuck it, it got me

16:31.500 --> 16:34.500
It was a goodie

16:34.500 --> 16:36.500
There's a scene in a restaurant? No

16:36.500 --> 16:39.500
The bear orders sushi

16:39.500 --> 16:43.500
The mom and brave turns into a bear and then she has to learn how to eat salmon

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
But she's not a bear, she's a woman, she's a queen

16:45.500 --> 16:48.500
And then the daughter has to teach her how to fish

16:48.500 --> 16:50.500
I cried, I'm an idiot

16:50.500 --> 16:54.500
That movie was not sold as a movie about bears

16:54.500 --> 16:59.500
It was supposed to be about a young girl who's good at archery

16:59.500 --> 17:02.500
I liked it though because it was only about women

17:02.500 --> 17:06.500
There was no damsel in distress, no knight in shining armor bullshit

17:06.500 --> 17:09.500
It was really just about female characters

17:09.500 --> 17:11.500
A guy didn't come in and save the day for once

17:11.500 --> 17:13.500
I kind of liked that

17:13.500 --> 17:18.500
And she didn't shave off all of her hair like Felicity

17:18.500 --> 17:20.500
She kept that beautiful mane

17:20.500 --> 17:27.500
Did Felicity do that to make a point that I'm bigger than my hair?

17:27.500 --> 17:31.500
Yeah, I think the idea was it was such a big move for Felicity to shave it off

17:31.500 --> 17:34.500
And then the ratings dropped

17:34.500 --> 17:37.500
You think about her, you think about her hair, it's true

17:37.500 --> 17:39.500
That hair was important

17:39.500 --> 17:41.500
But she doesn't have that hair on the Americans

17:41.500 --> 17:43.500
Have you seen the Americans?

17:43.500 --> 17:44.500
No, no

17:44.500 --> 17:48.500
She has a sex show where she's like a Soviet spy pretending to be American

17:48.500 --> 17:50.500
And she has short hair?

17:50.500 --> 17:53.500
Not short hair, but she doesn't have the curls

17:53.500 --> 17:55.500
She has Russian hair

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
And her name's not Felicity, right?

17:57.500 --> 17:58.500
No

17:58.500 --> 18:00.500
She eliminated everything, she got the whack-a-mole game right

18:00.500 --> 18:02.500
She knows that she's a good person

18:02.500 --> 18:04.500
She did it

18:04.500 --> 18:06.500
Whack-a-mole?

18:06.500 --> 18:08.500
Yeah, like...

18:08.500 --> 18:12.500
I'm assuming that she eliminates her hair

18:12.500 --> 18:14.500
She's like, God damn it, it's just my hair

18:14.500 --> 18:17.500
She's in the shopping aisle and she sees Us Magazine

18:17.500 --> 18:20.500
And it says, like, best hair ever, Felicity

18:20.500 --> 18:22.500
And she's like, fuck this, I'm cutting off my hair

18:22.500 --> 18:25.500
And then she cuts it off, and they're like

18:25.500 --> 18:28.500
Hey, good job acting

18:28.500 --> 18:29.500
Where'd your hair go?

18:29.500 --> 18:33.500
And then she gets a different job, but maybe the character's name is Felicity

18:33.500 --> 18:36.500
I was thinking maybe it was hard for her to nail down all the variables

18:36.500 --> 18:39.500
That she's in a quest to figure out that she's a good person

18:39.500 --> 18:41.500
I guess I can't back that up

18:41.500 --> 18:43.500
Alright

18:43.500 --> 18:44.500
I like it

18:44.500 --> 18:46.500
And back to Wreck-it Ralph

18:46.500 --> 18:47.500
Yeah

18:47.500 --> 18:48.500
Good movie

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
You enjoyed it?

18:49.500 --> 18:50.500
I did

18:50.500 --> 18:53.500
I found it not only touching in that kind of cloying way

18:53.500 --> 18:56.500
That most of those movies, you can kind of count on being touched now

18:56.500 --> 18:59.500
Like, it's sort of like being Catholic

18:59.500 --> 19:05.500
Hello, next in the way that you use it

19:05.500 --> 19:07.500
You can kind of...

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
I mean, to the point where it can actually make you well up

19:09.500 --> 19:11.500
And you're kind of like, now we take that for granted

19:11.500 --> 19:13.500
I'm like, I'm going to Pixar to hear her coming down

19:13.500 --> 19:16.500
It's just, you know, that guy is like such good animation

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
I can tell how alone he is

19:18.500 --> 19:21.500
But it's like, it's another thing to have that

19:21.500 --> 19:24.500
And then also, like, it's kind of profound

19:24.500 --> 19:27.500
Like, I thought, like, there's, I don't know

19:27.500 --> 19:30.500
There's a social subversiveness to it

19:30.500 --> 19:32.500
All that filtered through, it's a movie for kids

19:32.500 --> 19:34.500
But I was watching it going like

19:34.500 --> 19:38.500
I can't really nail them down on any bad messaging for anybody in particular

19:38.500 --> 19:41.500
They really had to thread a needle because there's a, you know

19:41.500 --> 19:44.500
There's a character in the movie that's like congenitally afflicted

19:44.500 --> 19:46.500
And it's like, oh, you're special, you're not special

19:46.500 --> 19:49.500
And I was like, how are they going to land this?

19:49.500 --> 19:53.500
Are they going to, is the moral going to be that she needs to not be afflicted?

19:53.500 --> 19:56.500
Or is the moral going to be that her affliction is a gift?

19:56.500 --> 19:58.500
Because it's hard to get through those highway cones these days

19:58.500 --> 20:00.500
And I thought they got through them as well as you possibly could

20:00.500 --> 20:02.500
What was the moral, eventually? I forgot

20:02.500 --> 20:06.500
It was like, there's evil people in the world that made you afflicted

20:06.500 --> 20:09.500
But your affliction is a matter of perception

20:09.500 --> 20:13.500
So as soon as you just participate with your affliction

20:13.500 --> 20:15.500
You stop being afflicted

20:15.500 --> 20:16.500
So it's really just a matter of

20:16.500 --> 20:18.500
So it's kind of like Thalidomide babies

20:18.500 --> 20:22.500
Yeah, just, if you're a Thalidomide baby, host a talk show

20:22.500 --> 20:24.500
That's the message, like get out there

20:25.500 --> 20:27.500
Get out there on a dancing show or something

20:27.500 --> 20:28.500
Yeah, just do it, yeah

20:28.500 --> 20:30.500
Just get out there, get in their face

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
Dancing with the Thalidomide stars

20:32.500 --> 20:35.500
Yeah, and then people

20:35.500 --> 20:39.500
I love the groans, like is Thalidomide babies even a thing anymore?

20:39.500 --> 20:40.500
To be upset about?

20:40.500 --> 20:43.500
It's like people being upset for Dracula

20:47.500 --> 20:49.500
Captain's hat is confused

20:49.500 --> 20:51.500
That's your friend Adam Goldberg

20:51.500 --> 20:52.500
Hi Adam

20:52.500 --> 20:54.500
Adam Goldberg has affected a skipper hat

20:56.500 --> 20:58.500
We'll see you on the Lido deck after the show

20:58.500 --> 21:03.500
Adam Goldberg has retired from being a Harmontown character by his own account

21:03.500 --> 21:07.500
He's now going to sit in the audience and slowly become Captain Crunch

21:07.500 --> 21:11.500
Like he's going to put more epaulets and metals on

21:11.500 --> 21:13.500
He's going to have a parrot in his shoulder going

21:13.500 --> 21:15.500
Not in the show, rot, rot!

21:16.500 --> 21:19.500
And he's going to tear up the roof of our mouths

21:21.500 --> 21:23.500
As Captain Crunch is known to do

21:23.500 --> 21:25.500
You're supposed to put milk in there Doug

21:25.500 --> 21:27.500
You're supposed to put milk in there

21:27.500 --> 21:29.500
You're supposed to put milk in there

21:29.500 --> 21:32.500
You've got to get them so soggy before they'll tear up your mouth

21:32.500 --> 21:35.500
Something in there that's slow, I think it's just like peeling, it's like chemical peel

21:35.500 --> 21:36.500
Milk or not

21:36.500 --> 21:40.500
Yeah, that's why I'll have the Crunch Berries because they're a goddamn relief

21:41.500 --> 21:43.500
Next to the Crunch itself

21:43.500 --> 21:47.500
They had a cereal cup, for a brief period they had ET cereal

21:47.500 --> 21:49.500
And it was because there were Reese's Pieces in the movie

21:49.500 --> 21:53.500
That was peanut butter chocolate cereal in the shapes of little E's and T's

21:53.500 --> 21:57.500
Because I assumed that they couldn't make them the shape of a bike or something

21:57.500 --> 21:59.500
And it was so fucking good

21:59.500 --> 22:01.500
And then it was like gone off the shelves immediately

22:01.500 --> 22:03.500
And I know it wasn't because they weren't delicious

22:03.500 --> 22:04.500
And I know it wasn't because they weren't selling

22:04.500 --> 22:06.500
So it must be because they gave me cancer

22:07.500 --> 22:11.500
I'm waiting to find out that ET cereal gave me cancer

22:11.500 --> 22:13.500
Oris Spielberg came down on it for some reason

22:13.500 --> 22:15.500
Would you think they tried to do it on the slide?

22:17.500 --> 22:18.500
Nice try

22:18.500 --> 22:22.500
ET and it says, extra tasty

22:25.500 --> 22:27.500
Vitamin E and thiamine

22:28.500 --> 22:31.500
Phone a bowl of delicious

22:33.500 --> 22:37.500
And it's just like, they got a kid on the box that's like a burn victim

22:37.500 --> 22:39.500
That's like, yeah

22:40.500 --> 22:42.500
Yeah, you're right, burn victims are funny

22:42.500 --> 22:43.500
So what am I, baby?

22:43.500 --> 22:45.500
No, burn victim, yes

22:45.500 --> 22:48.500
We're going to find, we're going to find, we're whack-a-mole in the audience

22:48.500 --> 22:51.500
And it says whack-a-mole, whack-a-mole, what the fuck?

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
I'm calling you out

22:52.500 --> 22:53.500
What does that mean?

22:53.500 --> 22:54.500
Sorry, sorry, sorry

22:54.500 --> 22:56.500
Have you tried Lincoln O's? Those are pretty good

22:56.500 --> 22:58.500
Lincoln, Lincoln O's

22:58.500 --> 22:59.500
Lincoln O's?

22:59.500 --> 23:00.500
Yeah, it's a new cereal

23:00.500 --> 23:01.500
Yeah

23:01.500 --> 23:03.500
Yeah, it tastes like freedom

23:03.500 --> 23:04.500
Freedom

23:04.500 --> 23:06.500
And raspberry

23:07.500 --> 23:10.500
Wait, is this a real thing or is this a hustler cartoon?

23:10.500 --> 23:15.500
Is it a real thing?

23:16.500 --> 23:18.500
Lincoln O's

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
Well, yeah

23:21.500 --> 23:24.500
Lincoln Logs, I guess would be a good breakfast drink

23:24.500 --> 23:26.500
You guys remember Hogan's Heroes, right?

23:26.500 --> 23:28.500
This world has insane things in it

23:28.500 --> 23:30.500
It does, it does have the craziest things

23:30.500 --> 23:32.500
It's sitcom about a concentration camp

23:32.500 --> 23:34.500
That's the best

23:35.500 --> 23:38.500
Alright, well, that was based off of the Billy Wilder film, right?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.500
Stalard 17, it was it?

23:40.500 --> 23:41.500
What was?

23:41.500 --> 23:42.500
Hogan's Heroes

23:42.500 --> 23:44.500
Wasn't it kind of based on the success of that film?

23:44.500 --> 23:46.500
Yeah, it's like, let's take the funny parts of that movie

23:46.500 --> 23:49.500
about the guys in a concentration camp

23:49.500 --> 23:50.500
Right

23:50.500 --> 23:52.500
And then make it a weekly series

23:52.500 --> 23:53.500
Exactly

23:53.500 --> 23:54.500
Where the Germans are done

23:54.500 --> 23:56.500
I remember like, you know, I was pretty young

23:56.500 --> 23:57.500
when I first started watching MASH

23:57.500 --> 23:59.500
I was like, MASH, that's a...

23:59.500 --> 24:01.500
The Korean War was really ugly

24:01.500 --> 24:03.500
and it's a hospital, that must have been a good pitch

24:03.500 --> 24:04.500
It's such a weird thing

24:04.500 --> 24:06.500
And then you watch the MASH movie

24:06.500 --> 24:08.500
and it's like a Robert Altman film

24:08.500 --> 24:10.500
and it's like this weird meandering thing

24:10.500 --> 24:12.500
about the Korean War

24:12.500 --> 24:14.500
Doesn't it end pretty much with a football game?

24:14.500 --> 24:15.500
Yeah

24:15.500 --> 24:17.500
It ends the way a lot of ski movies end

24:17.500 --> 24:19.500
in the 80s

24:19.500 --> 24:21.500
But you assume, because it's Robert Altman

24:21.500 --> 24:23.500
and the Korean War, that that means something

24:23.500 --> 24:25.500
and you go like, fuck it, I'll vote for someone else then

24:25.500 --> 24:26.500
What happened to ski movies?

24:26.500 --> 24:28.500
Ski movies were a thing for a while

24:28.500 --> 24:29.500
We accomplished it

24:29.500 --> 24:30.500
Adam Goldbrick

24:30.500 --> 24:33.500
I was about to make a scheme to be last week, so...

24:33.500 --> 24:34.500
Shut up

24:34.500 --> 24:35.500
Perfect

24:35.500 --> 24:37.500
You were about to make one, but you had the wrong hat on

24:39.500 --> 24:42.500
You were like, I'll get a ski hat and we'll talk

24:43.500 --> 24:44.500
You were about to make a ski movie?

24:44.500 --> 24:45.500
Yeah, for sci-fi

24:45.500 --> 24:46.500
For real?

24:46.500 --> 24:47.500
Yeah, I told you about it, I was really...

24:47.500 --> 24:49.500
I wasn't listening

24:51.500 --> 24:54.500
Do the listeners love it when he talks a lot off mic like that?

24:54.500 --> 24:55.500
Well, not off mic

24:55.500 --> 24:57.500
Some of them like it when he talks on mic

24:57.500 --> 24:59.500
Some of them don't, it's like a whole thing

24:59.500 --> 25:00.500
But can they hear him when he was just saying it?

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
No, they can't hear him really

25:01.500 --> 25:03.500
And you don't bother to repeat it?

25:03.500 --> 25:04.500
Sometimes they do

25:04.500 --> 25:06.500
I mean, you're an old pro, I can sense

25:06.500 --> 25:08.500
He's like, eh, don't worry about it

25:08.500 --> 25:10.500
Sometimes the mics pick it up, I don't know

25:10.500 --> 25:12.500
I kind of like, I let God decide

25:14.500 --> 25:15.500
You were God

25:15.500 --> 25:17.500
I am God, I let me decide

25:18.500 --> 25:20.500
So it depends on how much I've been drinking

25:20.500 --> 25:23.500
Doug, I'm sorry, I'm not audio running my show

25:25.500 --> 25:26.500
Like a steel trap

25:26.500 --> 25:28.500
Hey, it was just a question

25:28.500 --> 25:30.500
I know you have a lot of moles to whack

25:30.500 --> 25:35.500
He's a mixed bag, if you open this box, here, watch

25:35.500 --> 25:38.500
Is that what his profile says on Twitter, mixed bag?

25:39.500 --> 25:40.500
Oh, here we go

25:41.500 --> 25:45.500
A microphone is dangerously being extended towards Adam right now

25:45.500 --> 25:47.500
Oh, he's pulling it out of the stand

25:47.500 --> 25:48.500
Because he likes to hold on to it

25:48.500 --> 25:49.500
Because he's a pro

25:49.500 --> 25:50.500
Yep

25:51.500 --> 25:53.500
Oh, now what's supposed to happen?

25:53.500 --> 25:56.500
Now the host of this show has no microphone

25:56.500 --> 25:58.500
No microphone

25:59.500 --> 26:00.500
It's the danger zone

26:00.500 --> 26:05.500
No, last week I was hired on to production-manage a ski movie

26:05.500 --> 26:07.500
Called Avalanche Sharks

26:10.500 --> 26:12.500
Sweared hand to the Lord

26:12.500 --> 26:14.500
And it was renamed Avalanche Shark

26:14.500 --> 26:15.500
Then Avalanche Sharks

26:15.500 --> 26:18.500
Because they couldn't determine how many puppet sharks

26:18.500 --> 26:20.500
Should be furnished for the script

26:20.500 --> 26:23.500
This was a huge source of contention

26:23.500 --> 26:26.500
So they're still making ski movies, but they keep

26:26.500 --> 26:29.500
Killing all the actors with the puppets

26:29.500 --> 26:31.500
So this is a movie about people skiing

26:31.500 --> 26:32.500
And then there's an Avalanche

26:32.500 --> 26:34.500
But inside the Avalanche there are sharks

26:34.500 --> 26:36.500
Or the Avalanche was caused by sharks

26:36.500 --> 26:38.500
I couldn't get through all the way through the script

26:38.500 --> 26:40.500
I was supposed to be working on

26:42.500 --> 26:44.500
Yeah, that's about it

26:44.500 --> 26:47.500
Now he's gonna get the microphone back

26:47.500 --> 26:49.500
Microphone is going back in the stand

26:49.500 --> 26:50.500
Good call, Dan

26:50.500 --> 26:51.500
There you go

26:51.500 --> 26:53.500
Adam Goldberg, everyone

26:53.500 --> 26:54.500
Thank you, Adam

26:54.500 --> 26:56.500
Worth a try

26:56.500 --> 26:57.500
Worth a try

26:57.500 --> 26:58.500
That does bring up an interesting point

26:58.500 --> 26:59.500
As a fan of movies

26:59.500 --> 27:01.500
And probably a fan of crappy movies

27:01.500 --> 27:02.500
And talking about them

27:02.500 --> 27:05.500
What's your take on the sci-fi original movement

27:05.500 --> 27:09.500
Of like, Mansquito and Gator Bader

27:10.500 --> 27:12.500
You know, human dental floss

27:12.500 --> 27:15.500
And things that you're like 10, 15 years ago

27:15.500 --> 27:17.500
If you saw these titles you'd go, holy shit

27:17.500 --> 27:22.500
You know, you seem like you might be around my age

27:22.500 --> 27:24.500
Like the greatest thing used to be to get high

27:24.500 --> 27:26.500
And go to the actual video store

27:26.500 --> 27:27.500
And walk up and down aisles

27:27.500 --> 27:30.500
And look at pictures and read backs of boxes

27:30.500 --> 27:34.500
And go to sci-fi kickboxing sections

27:34.500 --> 27:35.500
And go like, holy shit

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
These people are trying as hard as they can

27:37.500 --> 27:38.500
To make a good movie

27:38.500 --> 27:39.500
This is their citizen Kane

27:39.500 --> 27:41.500
Let's watch the result

27:41.500 --> 27:45.500
And now in this post-Piranha 3D post-Mansquito world

27:45.500 --> 27:47.500
It's like, no, it's supposed to be funny

27:47.500 --> 27:50.500
Opto-Hirana Teradana

27:50.500 --> 27:52.500
Piranha Shark Gator

27:52.500 --> 27:54.500
It's hilarious, Debbie Gibson's in it

27:54.500 --> 27:55.500
It's funny

27:55.500 --> 27:58.500
And I'm kind of like, fuck you if you think it's funny

27:58.500 --> 28:00.500
Fuck you, try hard so I can laugh at you

28:00.500 --> 28:04.500
Without video stores, where do we go now?

28:04.500 --> 28:05.500
I don't have one

28:05.500 --> 28:07.500
But where do you go to argue with your girlfriend?

28:09.500 --> 28:10.500
To really find out

28:10.500 --> 28:12.500
Where do you go to have a horrible relationship?

28:12.500 --> 28:16.500
Yeah, it's like, you really want me to walk down this aisle?

28:16.500 --> 28:19.500
Yeah, the Tom Hanks Meg Ryan aisle

28:19.500 --> 28:20.500
Before the actual aisle

28:20.500 --> 28:24.500
Dan, can we hear your pitch on him in dental floss?

28:24.500 --> 28:27.500
It's a guy who works for the American Medical Association

28:27.500 --> 28:30.500
And he stops by the American Dental Association

28:30.500 --> 28:33.500
To tell them that they should be working together

28:33.500 --> 28:36.500
Because dentists aren't paying attention to medicine

28:36.500 --> 28:37.500
They're focused on the teeth

28:37.500 --> 28:39.500
And he's a doctor

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
And so he's like, what are you guys doing here?

28:41.500 --> 28:43.500
And they're like, pretty soon the whole world's going to be teeth, right?

28:43.500 --> 28:45.500
And then he...

28:45.500 --> 28:49.500
And we've got a virtual chamber to show you that

28:49.500 --> 28:50.500
And it's like a tooth chamber

28:50.500 --> 28:51.500
And he gets locked in it

28:51.500 --> 28:54.500
And then they maximize the calcium rays

28:54.500 --> 28:56.500
And he ends up between the teeth

28:56.500 --> 28:58.500
But because of his medical knowledge

28:58.500 --> 29:00.500
He's able to keep himself alive

29:00.500 --> 29:02.500
As his body is compressed by the teeth

29:02.500 --> 29:04.500
So he becomes effectively human dental floss

29:04.500 --> 29:06.500
By page 20

29:06.500 --> 29:08.500
And then he goes out in the streets

29:08.500 --> 29:09.500
And he finds that he's able

29:09.500 --> 29:11.500
There's a lot of heavy-handed metaphors about cleaning

29:11.500 --> 29:14.500
The streets, you know

29:14.500 --> 29:16.500
This place is needed, you know

29:16.500 --> 29:19.500
A lot of...it's got gum disease

29:19.500 --> 29:21.500
What...its gunners are bleeding

29:21.500 --> 29:23.500
It's a sign that it needs to brush harder

29:23.500 --> 29:25.500
It's dumb, it's a dumb movie

29:25.500 --> 29:29.500
It has Richard Marx's in it

29:29.500 --> 29:31.500
It's very...it's purposely campy

29:31.500 --> 29:32.500
It's stupid

29:32.500 --> 29:33.500
It's one of those, yeah

29:33.500 --> 29:37.500
Yeah, it's a fucking...it's a one million dollar sci-fi original

29:37.500 --> 29:39.500
And it's like, oh, I'm supposed to show up

29:39.500 --> 29:41.500
To watch you fuck around?

29:41.500 --> 29:42.500
I wanted to fuck around with my friends

29:42.500 --> 29:44.500
And some cheesy popcorn

29:44.500 --> 29:46.500
Yeah, I'm not a fan...

29:46.500 --> 29:47.500
I'm not into that they're making movies

29:47.500 --> 29:49.500
That are shit intentionally

29:49.500 --> 29:50.500
They're just shoving things together

29:50.500 --> 29:53.500
And calling it a movie

29:53.500 --> 29:55.500
I don't...I don't seek that out

29:55.500 --> 29:56.500
There's plenty of movies that try to be great

29:56.500 --> 29:57.500
And are awful

29:57.500 --> 29:59.500
Yeah, and that's what's funny

29:59.500 --> 30:00.500
That I like to watch

30:00.500 --> 30:01.500
That's why we have the Olympics

30:01.500 --> 30:03.500
And we don't have like shitty Olympics

30:03.500 --> 30:05.500
It's called Special Olympics

30:05.500 --> 30:08.500
But close enough

30:08.500 --> 30:10.500
But those people try even harder

30:10.500 --> 30:14.500
They still brought to you by...it's a little mild

30:14.500 --> 30:18.500
Special Olympians try as hard as real Olympians

30:18.500 --> 30:20.500
They're just special when they're trying

30:20.500 --> 30:21.500
Again, that's the whole point

30:21.500 --> 30:22.500
They probably try harder

30:22.500 --> 30:23.500
And then don't murder their girlfriend

30:23.500 --> 30:25.500
Through a bathroom door

30:25.500 --> 30:28.500
That's a reference I will pretend to get

30:28.500 --> 30:30.500
Because I'm sure it's going to be a shame

30:30.500 --> 30:31.500
That I don't get the right...

30:31.500 --> 30:32.500
But that combines...there was a guy

30:32.500 --> 30:36.500
Oscar Petraeus?

30:36.500 --> 30:38.500
Oh, he doesn't sound evil

30:38.500 --> 30:41.500
You really don't know the story of Oscar Petraeus?

30:41.500 --> 30:43.500
Dr. Petraeus?

30:43.500 --> 30:45.500
From beyond?

30:45.500 --> 30:46.500
Pretend this is not real

30:46.500 --> 30:48.500
Pretend that this is an idea I'm pitching to you

30:48.500 --> 30:49.500
To make a movie

30:49.500 --> 30:50.500
Okay, I work at Sci-Fi

30:50.500 --> 30:53.500
There is a guy that ran in the regular Olympics

30:53.500 --> 30:54.500
The last Olympics

30:54.500 --> 30:57.500
And he has...he's missing both legs below the knee

30:57.500 --> 30:58.500
What?

30:58.500 --> 30:59.500
And they call him the Blade Runner

30:59.500 --> 31:00.500
The Blade Runner?

31:00.500 --> 31:01.500
Because he has two behind his back?

31:01.500 --> 31:02.500
No

31:02.500 --> 31:03.500
To his face

31:03.500 --> 31:04.500
To his face

31:04.500 --> 31:06.500
They're like, you're a replicant

31:06.500 --> 31:09.500
He has two...two metal...

31:09.500 --> 31:10.500
Two metal, like, kind of hooky things

31:10.500 --> 31:11.500
That he runs on

31:11.500 --> 31:12.500
And people are like, and he runs like...

31:12.500 --> 31:13.500
They look like springs

31:13.500 --> 31:14.500
I thought it was cheating

31:14.500 --> 31:15.500
Yeah

31:15.500 --> 31:17.500
Do they know Blade Runners aren't replicants?

31:17.500 --> 31:19.500
Or might be depending on which cut of the movie

31:19.500 --> 31:22.500
I don't think...

31:22.500 --> 31:23.500
I want to know how much...

31:23.500 --> 31:24.500
Are they calling him a robot

31:24.500 --> 31:25.500
Or are they calling him like...

31:25.500 --> 31:26.500
Because they're like blades

31:26.500 --> 31:28.500
He's a runner and there's two metal things

31:28.500 --> 31:29.500
On his legs

31:29.500 --> 31:30.500
They're like blades

31:30.500 --> 31:31.500
They're like springy, weird blades

31:31.500 --> 31:33.500
And he was a big hero in the Olympics

31:33.500 --> 31:34.500
It was a big thing

31:34.500 --> 31:37.500
And now he recently is under a murder investigation

31:37.500 --> 31:39.500
For shooting his girlfriend to pieces

31:39.500 --> 31:40.500
In the bathroom

31:40.500 --> 31:41.500
Jesus

31:41.500 --> 31:42.500
Shot her through the bathroom door

31:42.500 --> 31:45.500
His story is that he heard noise in the bathroom

31:45.500 --> 31:46.500
Thought it was a burglar

31:46.500 --> 31:47.500
Because a lot of burglars...

31:47.500 --> 31:49.500
What the first thing they'll do is take a dump

31:49.500 --> 31:51.500
And...

31:51.500 --> 31:54.500
And he didn't bother to look to see if his girlfriend

31:54.500 --> 31:55.500
Was in bed with him

31:55.500 --> 31:56.500
That's the guy

31:56.500 --> 31:58.500
Someone just handed Dan a phone with a picture on it

31:58.500 --> 32:00.500
And he...

32:00.500 --> 32:01.500
So he shot through the bathroom door

32:01.500 --> 32:02.500
Because he thought it was a burglar

32:02.500 --> 32:03.500
Do you know what...

32:03.500 --> 32:05.500
Okay, am I racist?

32:05.500 --> 32:07.500
Because I assumed he was black

32:07.500 --> 32:08.500
Because...

32:08.500 --> 32:09.500
Yes

32:09.500 --> 32:12.500
Yes, you are

32:12.500 --> 32:13.500
Because what?

32:13.500 --> 32:15.500
But not because of the murder

32:15.500 --> 32:16.500
Because of the...

32:16.500 --> 32:18.500
Because of the Olympian prowess

32:18.500 --> 32:20.500
Because of the...

32:20.500 --> 32:21.500
I picture it

32:21.500 --> 32:23.500
Even like those black dudes

32:23.500 --> 32:24.500
I know it's still racist

32:24.500 --> 32:26.500
Better athletes than you

32:26.500 --> 32:28.500
But I was like...

32:28.500 --> 32:30.500
It was reasonable racism

32:30.500 --> 32:31.500
I was like...

32:31.500 --> 32:33.500
You said he was like an amazing runner

32:33.500 --> 32:34.500
And he's from South Africa

32:34.500 --> 32:35.500
But that's a Dutch colony

32:35.500 --> 32:37.500
So, you know, it was a toss-up

32:37.500 --> 32:38.500
I didn't hear South Africa

32:38.500 --> 32:39.500
That's not...

32:39.500 --> 32:40.500
I immediately was just like...

32:40.500 --> 32:42.500
I just pictured a fucking amazing runner

32:42.500 --> 32:43.500
With robot legs

32:43.500 --> 32:45.500
And I pictured an awesome black guy

32:45.500 --> 32:47.500
Tell me because it has to in some way

32:47.500 --> 32:48.500
Some minute way

32:48.500 --> 32:49.500
Or maybe some grand way

32:49.500 --> 32:52.500
Affects your new perception of this guy

32:52.500 --> 32:54.500
I hate him more

32:54.500 --> 32:55.500
Because I was raised in the 70s

32:55.500 --> 32:57.500
I thought if he was black

32:57.500 --> 32:58.500
I was like, well, maybe

32:58.500 --> 33:02.500
What did this woman do to him?

33:02.500 --> 33:04.500
Turns out she was just beautiful

33:04.500 --> 33:08.500
And trying to take a shit

33:08.500 --> 33:10.500
Hey, I know you got lots more things going on tonight

33:10.500 --> 33:11.500
I'm going to take off

33:11.500 --> 33:13.500
But thank you so much for having me

33:13.500 --> 33:15.500
Thank you, Doug Benson

33:22.500 --> 33:23.500
Doug Benson

33:23.500 --> 33:25.500
He read the writing on the wall

33:25.500 --> 33:26.500
When he got out on stage

33:26.500 --> 33:28.500
He's like, if I'm going to get out of here

33:28.500 --> 33:29.500
In an orderly fashion

33:29.500 --> 33:30.500
It's going to be because of professional

33:30.500 --> 33:32.500
Schedules this thing

33:32.500 --> 33:33.500
That was very pro

33:33.500 --> 33:35.500
He's got to laugh and just bone out

33:37.500 --> 33:38.500
All right

33:38.500 --> 33:39.500
To his point

33:39.500 --> 33:40.500
Wait, should we talk about the Blade Runner?

33:40.500 --> 33:42.500
No, everyone's talking about him

33:42.500 --> 33:44.500
Also, I'm kind of proud of the fact that

33:44.500 --> 33:48.500
Because of my pop-cultural deafness

33:48.500 --> 33:51.500
I'm not plugged in at all anymore

33:51.500 --> 33:55.500
We never talked about that fucking

33:55.500 --> 33:57.500
Crazy super villain

33:57.500 --> 33:59.500
That cop that went nuts

33:59.500 --> 34:01.500
And was shooting other cops

34:01.500 --> 34:02.500
And then they burnt him to death

34:02.500 --> 34:04.500
In a cabin and blah, blah, blah

34:04.500 --> 34:05.500
I just wanted to bring up the fact

34:05.500 --> 34:06.500
That we never talked about it

34:06.500 --> 34:07.500
Also, I feel like

34:07.500 --> 34:09.500
I got a lot of media coverage for it

34:09.500 --> 34:10.500
But then it was just kind of gone

34:10.500 --> 34:11.500
It seemed like

34:11.500 --> 34:13.500
I think it was so much malfeasance

34:13.500 --> 34:15.500
And shit that went down

34:15.500 --> 34:18.500
LAPDs shoot up a bunch of innocent fuckers

34:18.500 --> 34:20.500
A bad cop got chased

34:20.500 --> 34:21.500
By other bad cops

34:21.500 --> 34:24.500
And everybody else died

34:24.500 --> 34:25.500
Yeah, that was like

34:25.500 --> 34:26.500
Yeah, that was just a rug

34:26.500 --> 34:27.500
Getting like boom, boom

34:27.500 --> 34:29.500
Like out in the middle of the room

34:29.500 --> 34:30.500
And yeah

34:30.500 --> 34:31.500
I don't think I've told it in harm intended

34:31.500 --> 34:33.500
I won't make it a long story if possible

34:33.500 --> 34:34.500
Like I was walking

34:34.500 --> 34:35.500
I went to USC

34:35.500 --> 34:36.500
And I was walking down the road

34:36.500 --> 34:37.500
With my friend Matt Gorley

34:37.500 --> 34:39.500
Just super ego podcast and stuff

34:39.500 --> 34:41.500
And we're walking up the road

34:41.500 --> 34:43.500
And we've been playing like with pellet guns

34:43.500 --> 34:44.500
We actually had guns on us

34:44.500 --> 34:46.500
Early like little replica Berettas

34:46.500 --> 34:47.500
We're just like little like

34:47.500 --> 34:48.500
Shot little plastic balls

34:48.500 --> 34:49.500
Like before Airsoft

34:49.500 --> 34:50.500
We're walking up Figueroa Boulevard

34:50.500 --> 34:52.500
Downtown South Central

34:52.500 --> 34:54.500
And with another friend of ours Kenny

34:54.500 --> 34:55.500
And a car goes by us

34:55.500 --> 34:56.500
And backfires

34:56.500 --> 34:58.500
And that doesn't really happen anymore

34:58.500 --> 34:59.500
Like you don't hear the old time

34:59.500 --> 35:00.500
He's like bang

35:00.500 --> 35:01.500
Like the old like you know

35:01.500 --> 35:02.500
Admissions bro

35:02.500 --> 35:04.500
You gotta get that shit checked out

35:04.500 --> 35:05.500
Absolutely

35:05.500 --> 35:07.500
Well, you don't see a lot of dog shit

35:07.500 --> 35:08.500
Our friend Kenny heard

35:08.500 --> 35:09.500
This old truck go by

35:09.500 --> 35:10.500
And went bam

35:10.500 --> 35:12.500
And he just jokingly fell down

35:12.500 --> 35:13.500
Like he had been shot

35:13.500 --> 35:15.500
And then LAPD cop car

35:15.500 --> 35:17.500
Came U-turn

35:17.500 --> 35:19.500
And came up on the curb

35:19.500 --> 35:21.500
Going the wrong way on the street

35:21.500 --> 35:22.500
And two guys emerged from it

35:22.500 --> 35:24.500
Two officers with guns

35:24.500 --> 35:25.500
Out of their holsters

35:25.500 --> 35:26.500
Not pointed at us

35:26.500 --> 35:28.500
But guns out of their holsters

35:28.500 --> 35:29.500
Screaming to me

35:29.500 --> 35:30.500
Oh, Kenny falls down

35:30.500 --> 35:32.500
Matt keeps walking

35:32.500 --> 35:33.500
And I'm kind of like

35:33.500 --> 35:35.500
Like to stand there

35:35.500 --> 35:36.500
Like you know

35:36.500 --> 35:37.500
Like not taunting him

35:37.500 --> 35:38.500
But like I got a funny bit

35:38.500 --> 35:39.500
Like get back up

35:39.500 --> 35:40.500
Or whatever

35:40.500 --> 35:43.500
And the cops screaming at me

35:43.500 --> 35:44.500
Getting in the wall

35:44.500 --> 35:45.500
Getting in the wall

35:45.500 --> 35:47.500
And like freaking out

35:47.500 --> 35:48.500
Not like

35:48.500 --> 35:49.500
Like freeze

35:49.500 --> 35:50.500
Get your hands up

35:50.500 --> 35:52.500
Like no cops show stuff

35:52.500 --> 35:53.500
Losing their minds

35:53.500 --> 35:54.500
And now at this point

35:54.500 --> 35:55.500
Kenny's getting up

35:55.500 --> 35:56.500
And he's fine

35:56.500 --> 35:57.500
I'm like

35:57.500 --> 35:58.500
Jesus Christ

35:58.500 --> 35:59.500
What the fuck is going on

35:59.500 --> 36:00.500
What the fuck is going on

36:00.500 --> 36:01.500
You

36:01.500 --> 36:02.500
I'm like

36:02.500 --> 36:03.500
What's going on

36:03.500 --> 36:04.500
And Kenny's like

36:04.500 --> 36:06.500
A car backfired bro

36:06.500 --> 36:07.500
And I'm like

36:07.500 --> 36:08.500
And one of the cops

36:08.500 --> 36:09.500
Oh my

36:09.500 --> 36:10.500
Oh Jesus

36:10.500 --> 36:12.500
Oh Jesus Christ

36:12.500 --> 36:13.500
Jesus Christ

36:13.500 --> 36:15.500
Who thought you killed them

36:15.500 --> 36:16.500
I was like

36:16.500 --> 36:18.500
Put your guns away

36:18.500 --> 36:20.500
That story's called

36:20.500 --> 36:21.500
Cops are human

36:21.500 --> 36:22.500
I mean they didn't

36:22.500 --> 36:23.500
Yeah but how about

36:23.500 --> 36:24.500
They didn't know who to shoot

36:24.500 --> 36:25.500
Here's a story called

36:25.500 --> 36:26.500
Cops are human

36:26.500 --> 36:27.500
Don't give them guns

36:27.500 --> 36:28.500
Well

36:28.500 --> 36:29.500
No more fucking guns

36:29.500 --> 36:30.500
But at least

36:30.500 --> 36:31.500
I don't know

36:31.500 --> 36:32.500
That sounds like

36:32.500 --> 36:34.500
That's the best cops story I've ever heard

36:34.500 --> 36:35.500
I almost got shot to pieces

36:35.500 --> 36:36.500
Because these guys

36:36.500 --> 36:37.500
You didn't almost get shot to pieces

36:37.500 --> 36:38.500
They took their guns out

36:38.500 --> 36:39.500
Because they thought

36:39.500 --> 36:40.500
That someone got shot

36:40.500 --> 36:41.500
And they didn't know who

36:41.500 --> 36:42.500
But they weren't being cool about it

36:42.500 --> 36:43.500
Well they

36:44.500 --> 36:45.500
Thank God because

36:45.500 --> 36:46.500
Thank God they're not cyborgs

36:46.500 --> 36:47.500
Or like

36:47.500 --> 36:48.500
I don't know

36:48.500 --> 36:49.500
No fuckers get shot

36:49.500 --> 36:50.500
Because they accidentally

36:50.500 --> 36:51.500
The bad version of the story

36:51.500 --> 36:52.500
Would have been like

36:52.500 --> 36:53.500
If they pointed a gun

36:53.500 --> 36:54.500
At someone's face

36:54.500 --> 36:55.500
And were like

36:55.500 --> 36:56.500
You know what I mean

36:56.500 --> 36:57.500
Like I don't know

36:57.500 --> 36:58.500
They panicked

36:58.500 --> 36:59.500
Because they thought

36:59.500 --> 37:00.500
Someone actually

37:00.500 --> 37:01.500
Was needed to help

37:01.500 --> 37:02.500
A crazy post traumatic stress disorder

37:02.500 --> 37:03.500
Cop

37:03.500 --> 37:04.500
Threatened to kill everybody

37:04.500 --> 37:05.500
In the LAPD

37:05.500 --> 37:06.500
And their response

37:06.500 --> 37:07.500
Was to go and start

37:07.500 --> 37:08.500
Shooting Mexican ladies

37:08.500 --> 37:09.500
Stuff like that

37:09.500 --> 37:10.500
Yeah well

37:10.500 --> 37:11.500
I mean God knows

37:11.500 --> 37:12.500
I mean the LAPD

37:12.500 --> 37:13.500
Is the only police force

37:13.500 --> 37:14.500
In the

37:14.500 --> 37:15.500
In the country

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
Strangely I know this

37:17.500 --> 37:18.500
Only because I wrote

37:18.500 --> 37:20.500
A sitcom script for

37:20.500 --> 37:21.500
A

37:21.500 --> 37:22.500
Called cop house

37:28.500 --> 37:30.500
So I researched

37:30.500 --> 37:31.500
I forgot that was the name

37:31.500 --> 37:32.500
Research the

37:33.500 --> 37:34.500
It was based on

37:34.500 --> 37:35.500
An internal idea

37:35.500 --> 37:36.500
About a bunch of

37:36.500 --> 37:37.500
The house is a cop

37:37.500 --> 37:41.500
Yeah

37:41.500 --> 37:42.500
It's kind of like

37:42.500 --> 37:43.500
Monster house

37:45.500 --> 37:46.500
Here comes the neighborhood

37:46.500 --> 37:47.500
A house

37:53.500 --> 37:54.500
A house is so

37:54.500 --> 37:55.500
Tired of being robbed

37:56.500 --> 37:57.500
And broken into

37:57.500 --> 37:58.500
It's set in the future

37:58.500 --> 37:59.500
All houses are monsters

37:59.500 --> 38:00.500
But some of them

38:00.500 --> 38:01.500
Are trying to

38:01.500 --> 38:02.500
Make things right

38:02.500 --> 38:03.500
Right

38:03.500 --> 38:04.500
There are over

38:04.500 --> 38:05.500
18 million

38:05.500 --> 38:07.500
9-1-1 calls about

38:07.500 --> 38:08.500
Monster houses

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
One house has had too much

38:12.500 --> 38:13.500
I was researching

38:13.500 --> 38:14.500
The LAPD

38:14.500 --> 38:15.500
And it was like

38:15.500 --> 38:16.500
In the wake of the

38:16.500 --> 38:17.500
Rodney King business

38:17.500 --> 38:18.500
And then there was

38:18.500 --> 38:19.500
This other

38:19.500 --> 38:20.500
Was it on the tail of that

38:20.500 --> 38:21.500
Or right before that

38:21.500 --> 38:22.500
But it was like

38:22.500 --> 38:23.500
The rampart scandal

38:23.500 --> 38:24.500
Where there was

38:24.500 --> 38:25.500
An anti-gang

38:25.500 --> 38:26.500
Task force

38:26.500 --> 38:27.500
In the LAPD

38:27.500 --> 38:28.500
It was like

38:28.500 --> 38:29.500
Look we have a huge

38:29.500 --> 38:30.500
Gang problem

38:30.500 --> 38:31.500
Let's just

38:31.500 --> 38:32.500
Let's devote

38:32.500 --> 38:33.500
A force of police

38:33.500 --> 38:34.500
Like a little squad

38:34.500 --> 38:35.500
Just anti-gang

38:35.500 --> 38:36.500
In a

38:36.500 --> 38:37.500
Rampart district

38:37.500 --> 38:38.500
Like

38:38.500 --> 38:39.500
That's all you care about

38:39.500 --> 38:40.500
It's just

38:40.500 --> 38:41.500
Like gang activity

38:41.500 --> 38:42.500
Just get it down

38:42.500 --> 38:43.500
Which is just like

38:43.500 --> 38:44.500
Saying to Robocop

38:44.500 --> 38:45.500
Just like go get them boy

38:45.500 --> 38:46.500
And they

38:46.500 --> 38:47.500
Of course

38:47.500 --> 38:48.500
Like they would

38:48.500 --> 38:49.500
Probably make an

38:49.500 --> 38:50.500
Amazing movie

38:50.500 --> 38:51.500
I'm sure they probably

38:51.500 --> 38:52.500
Made three bad movies about it

38:52.500 --> 38:53.500
In one sense or another

38:53.500 --> 38:54.500
That have like

38:54.500 --> 38:55.500
Jake Gyllenhaal

38:55.500 --> 38:56.500
Or Shia LaBeouf in it

38:56.500 --> 38:57.500
Or something like that

38:57.500 --> 38:58.500
I think colors right

38:58.500 --> 38:59.500
But they

38:59.500 --> 39:00.500
Essentially they became

39:00.500 --> 39:01.500
Another gang

39:01.500 --> 39:02.500
Because they were

39:02.500 --> 39:03.500
They had to

39:03.500 --> 39:04.500
You know

39:04.500 --> 39:05.500
They just got mired in it

39:05.500 --> 39:06.500
And they

39:06.500 --> 39:07.500
But the bad thing about that

39:07.500 --> 39:08.500
Is that they're a gang

39:08.500 --> 39:09.500
That you can't call the cops on

39:09.500 --> 39:10.500
At all

39:10.500 --> 39:11.500
So like they're a gang

39:11.500 --> 39:12.500
That has

39:12.500 --> 39:13.500
So there was horrible things

39:13.500 --> 39:14.500
Happening

39:14.500 --> 39:15.500
Long story short

39:15.500 --> 39:16.500
If there was a cop here

39:16.500 --> 39:17.500
In the audience

39:17.500 --> 39:18.500
Or somebody that worked

39:18.500 --> 39:19.500
In law enforcement

39:19.500 --> 39:20.500
I'd love to

39:20.500 --> 39:21.500
I'm sure it's easy to like

39:21.500 --> 39:22.500
Pinata

39:22.500 --> 39:23.500
Are the most low

39:23.500 --> 39:24.500
We have an admiral

39:24.500 --> 39:25.500
Over here

39:25.500 --> 39:28.500
But the LAPD

39:28.500 --> 39:30.500
Is the only police force

39:30.500 --> 39:31.500
In the United States history

39:31.500 --> 39:32.500
To my knowledge

39:32.500 --> 39:33.500
That has ever been like

39:33.500 --> 39:34.500
It had to have the

39:34.500 --> 39:35.500
Department of Justice

39:35.500 --> 39:36.500
Like take it over

39:36.500 --> 39:38.500
And like oversee it

39:38.500 --> 39:40.500
Like every other city

39:40.500 --> 39:41.500
That you can name it

39:41.500 --> 39:42.500
As a police force

39:42.500 --> 39:43.500
They have their ups

39:43.500 --> 39:44.500
And they have their downs

39:44.500 --> 39:45.500
And they have their scandals

39:45.500 --> 39:46.500
And stuff

39:46.500 --> 39:47.500
But the LAPD

39:47.500 --> 39:48.500
Just had so much shit going on

39:48.500 --> 39:49.500
In a row

39:49.500 --> 39:50.500
That at one point

39:50.500 --> 39:51.500
The federal government

39:51.500 --> 39:53.500
Started running the LAPD

39:53.500 --> 39:54.500
Which is so close to

39:54.500 --> 39:56.500
Omni-consumer products

39:56.500 --> 39:57.500
Coming in

39:57.500 --> 39:59.500
It's really fascinating

39:59.500 --> 40:00.500
Like the 90s in LA

40:00.500 --> 40:01.500
And the police force

40:01.500 --> 40:02.500
Who cares?

40:02.500 --> 40:03.500
It's fascinating

40:03.500 --> 40:04.500
So Google it

40:04.500 --> 40:05.500
On the other hand

40:05.500 --> 40:06.500
If you want to be entertained

40:06.500 --> 40:07.500
Listen to me

40:07.500 --> 40:08.500
Sorry

40:08.500 --> 40:11.500
Let's keep the show rolling

40:11.500 --> 40:13.500
And bring up more friends

40:13.500 --> 40:17.500
Who do you got?

40:17.500 --> 40:19.500
Let's start off with Spencer

40:19.500 --> 40:20.500
On stage for one

40:20.500 --> 40:21.500
How about that?

40:21.500 --> 40:22.500
All right

40:22.500 --> 40:36.500
Spencer, our Dungeon Master

40:36.500 --> 40:39.500
I lost a button in the bathroom

40:39.500 --> 40:40.500
Yeah, I know

40:40.500 --> 40:41.500
You told me

40:41.500 --> 40:42.500
You were so excited

40:42.500 --> 40:43.500
It was a show

40:43.500 --> 40:47.500
What's going on at the Apple Store?

40:47.500 --> 40:48.500
Okay

40:48.500 --> 40:49.500
So there's a thing

40:49.500 --> 40:50.500
Called PI

40:50.500 --> 40:51.500
Physical Inventory

40:51.500 --> 40:53.500
It happens twice a year

40:53.500 --> 40:55.500
And usually we get

40:55.500 --> 40:57.500
Like two months to prepare for it

40:57.500 --> 40:58.500
And they told us

40:58.500 --> 41:00.500
Like six days ago

41:00.500 --> 41:01.500
They're like

41:01.500 --> 41:03.500
PI's in a matter of weeks

41:03.500 --> 41:04.500
They told us under three weeks

41:04.500 --> 41:05.500
I guess

41:05.500 --> 41:06.500
Around

41:06.500 --> 41:08.500
And we're also two people

41:08.500 --> 41:09.500
Down on our team

41:09.500 --> 41:10.500
So we're kind of screwed

41:10.500 --> 41:12.500
But also it's fine

41:12.500 --> 41:13.500
It's like

41:13.500 --> 41:15.500
It's like sweeps week

41:15.500 --> 41:16.500
This is like crucial times

41:16.500 --> 41:17.500
Yeah

41:17.500 --> 41:18.500
See as you guys

41:18.500 --> 41:19.500
Might know

41:19.500 --> 41:20.500
I count stuff

41:20.500 --> 41:22.500
This is counting to the extreme

41:22.500 --> 41:24.500
This is where the till

41:24.500 --> 41:27.500
Has to match the digital

41:27.500 --> 41:29.500
So we have computers that we use

41:29.500 --> 41:30.500
And we have like

41:30.500 --> 41:31.500
iPods that we use

41:31.500 --> 41:32.500
And iPads

41:32.500 --> 41:33.500
And like

41:33.500 --> 41:34.500
There's a bunch of them

41:34.500 --> 41:35.500
But we gotta

41:35.500 --> 41:36.500
Count for all of them

41:36.500 --> 41:37.500
And make sure all the iPads

41:37.500 --> 41:38.500
Are in order

41:38.500 --> 41:39.500
And they get lost

41:39.500 --> 41:40.500
It's crazy

41:40.500 --> 41:41.500
You wouldn't think

41:41.500 --> 41:42.500
You'd lose stuff like that

41:42.500 --> 41:43.500
But it happens

41:43.500 --> 41:44.500
And people hide them

41:44.500 --> 41:45.500
And stuff

41:45.500 --> 41:46.500
Yeah

41:46.500 --> 41:47.500
You wouldn't think

41:47.500 --> 41:48.500
Working in a giant warehouse

41:48.500 --> 41:49.500
Full of really expensive

41:49.500 --> 41:50.500
In the back

41:50.500 --> 41:51.500
Like the floor is really

41:51.500 --> 41:52.500
Wide and expansive

41:52.500 --> 41:53.500
But in the back

41:53.500 --> 41:54.500
There's like

41:54.500 --> 41:55.500
Nothing

41:55.500 --> 41:56.500
Do Apple employees

41:56.500 --> 41:57.500
Is it possible in that

41:57.500 --> 41:58.500
Because those stores are so slick

41:58.500 --> 41:59.500
And they're so

41:59.500 --> 42:00.500
It's such a well-oiled machine

42:00.500 --> 42:01.500
Is it possible

42:01.500 --> 42:02.500
To like steal stuff

42:02.500 --> 42:03.500
In the back

42:03.500 --> 42:04.500
Like in employees

42:04.500 --> 42:05.500
Because I worked at Trader Joe's

42:05.500 --> 42:06.500
And I robbed that

42:06.500 --> 42:07.500
Fucker blind

42:07.500 --> 42:10.500
But those were potato chips

42:10.500 --> 42:11.500
And fucking beer and shit

42:11.500 --> 42:13.500
Like when my older brother

42:13.500 --> 42:14.500
Worked there

42:14.500 --> 42:15.500
I heard stories

42:15.500 --> 42:16.500
Of sometimes that stuff

42:16.500 --> 42:17.500
Happening

42:17.500 --> 42:18.500
But I'd never seen it happen

42:18.500 --> 42:19.500
And if I did

42:19.500 --> 42:20.500
I probably shouldn't talk about it

42:20.500 --> 42:21.500
But honestly

42:21.500 --> 42:22.500
Honestly

42:22.500 --> 42:23.500
I haven't seen it happen

42:23.500 --> 42:24.500
So

42:24.500 --> 42:25.500
Yeah

42:25.500 --> 42:26.500
I would imagine it'd be hard to get

42:26.500 --> 42:27.500
I imagine we'd have to

42:27.500 --> 42:28.500
Because we count it so well

42:28.500 --> 42:29.500
Yeah

42:29.500 --> 42:30.500
But like you said once

42:30.500 --> 42:31.500
Which is one of my favorite quotes

42:31.500 --> 42:32.500
Sometimes you just count less

42:32.500 --> 42:33.500
Sometimes

42:33.500 --> 42:34.500
Yeah

42:34.500 --> 42:35.500
That was a joke

42:35.500 --> 42:36.500
Yeah

42:36.500 --> 42:38.500
For like a biopic

42:38.500 --> 42:40.500
Where Spencer is like

42:40.500 --> 42:42.500
It's like a period film

42:42.500 --> 42:44.500
Created in the future

42:44.500 --> 42:45.500
About like a great

42:45.500 --> 42:46.500
Apple thief

42:46.500 --> 42:48.500
We had an idea of stealing batteries

42:48.500 --> 42:49.500
Sometimes you just count less

42:49.500 --> 42:52.500
He was Apple's most wanted

42:52.500 --> 42:53.500
See here's the plot though

42:53.500 --> 42:56.500
When they swap out mice and keyboards

42:56.500 --> 42:58.500
They give those back to us

42:58.500 --> 42:59.500
They don't need those batteries

42:59.500 --> 43:00.500
You take those batteries out

43:00.500 --> 43:02.500
That's two double A's

43:02.500 --> 43:05.500
That's a potential profit of

43:05.500 --> 43:06.500
You know

43:06.500 --> 43:07.500
Three to four dollars on the black market

43:07.500 --> 43:08.500
You know

43:08.500 --> 43:09.500
It's nice

43:09.500 --> 43:10.500
You see you're just swimming

43:10.500 --> 43:11.500
In batteries back home

43:11.500 --> 43:13.500
Just dealing in batteries

43:13.500 --> 43:14.500
No

43:14.500 --> 43:15.500
I don't know

43:15.500 --> 43:17.500
It's a good idea right?

43:17.500 --> 43:18.500
No

43:18.500 --> 43:19.500
Well I mean

43:19.500 --> 43:20.500
It could use a little work I guess

43:20.500 --> 43:21.500
Alright

43:21.500 --> 43:23.500
Oh we'll workshop it

43:23.500 --> 43:25.500
I have a retraction to make

43:25.500 --> 43:28.500
Bruce Valanche

43:28.500 --> 43:31.500
Who Dan dealt a pretty strong blow to last week

43:31.500 --> 43:34.500
I said to recap as quickly as possible

43:34.500 --> 43:36.500
What I said and my mistake was

43:36.500 --> 43:39.500
Because Schrab told me third hand

43:39.500 --> 43:41.500
We were at the office and he said

43:41.500 --> 43:42.500
And I recounted this thing

43:42.500 --> 43:44.500
Like oh somebody wrote an article

43:44.500 --> 43:46.500
And they said hey you should fire Bruce Valanche

43:46.500 --> 43:47.500
From the Oscars

43:47.500 --> 43:48.500
That's how you make them better

43:48.500 --> 43:50.500
Bruce Valanche wrote a comment under it

43:50.500 --> 43:51.500
Saying

43:51.500 --> 43:54.500
Well I'm very sorry you don't like me

43:54.500 --> 43:56.500
But you know we all wrote that Oscar

43:56.500 --> 43:58.500
Opening together and blah blah blah

43:58.500 --> 44:01.500
Definitely a cautionary tale

44:01.500 --> 44:03.500
This is how urban legends and gossip

44:03.500 --> 44:04.500
Get started because

44:04.500 --> 44:05.500
Somebody linked to that article

44:05.500 --> 44:06.500
I went and looked at it

44:06.500 --> 44:08.500
And Schrab was not inaccurate

44:08.500 --> 44:09.500
In what he was reporting to me

44:09.500 --> 44:13.500
But the Asian American telephone

44:13.500 --> 44:17.500
Of it all turned it into

44:17.500 --> 44:19.500
I don't know what the

44:19.500 --> 44:21.500
We've been over this

44:21.500 --> 44:22.500
You could just say telephone game

44:22.500 --> 44:24.500
When I was in the Midwest

44:24.500 --> 44:25.500
When I was in the Midwest

44:25.500 --> 44:28.500
It was called a Chinese telephone

44:28.500 --> 44:30.500
Why would you balk at bed?

44:30.500 --> 44:33.500
You assumed a murderer was a black guy earlier

44:33.500 --> 44:35.500
Because we already talked about it

44:35.500 --> 44:36.500
In this podcast

44:36.500 --> 44:37.500
And I don't want to become

44:37.500 --> 44:38.500
Prairie Home Companion

44:38.500 --> 44:39.500
Where it's just like

44:39.500 --> 44:41.500
B-bop-a-rub-bop-rub-bop-i

44:41.500 --> 44:43.500
I know I'm racist, we get it

44:47.500 --> 44:49.500
But I looked at the article

44:49.500 --> 44:50.500
That we were talking about

44:50.500 --> 44:51.500
For those of you who listened

44:51.500 --> 44:53.500
To a couple episodes back

44:53.500 --> 44:55.500
And I looked at the comment

44:55.500 --> 44:56.500
That Bruce wrote

44:56.500 --> 44:58.500
And I don't think

44:58.500 --> 44:59.500
That he's guilty of anything

44:59.500 --> 45:01.500
Worthy of me maligning him

45:01.500 --> 45:04.500
He said we wrote

45:04.500 --> 45:06.500
And we rewrote the Oscars together

45:06.500 --> 45:08.500
Which in general is true

45:08.500 --> 45:10.500
We did sit there in a room together

45:10.500 --> 45:11.500
And try to write jokes

45:11.500 --> 45:12.500
That Hugh Jackman should be saying

45:12.500 --> 45:14.500
He didn't actually

45:14.500 --> 45:15.500
He never said

45:15.500 --> 45:17.500
Like I wrote the

45:17.500 --> 45:18.500
The reader dance or anything

45:18.500 --> 45:19.500
Like he didn't claim authorship

45:19.500 --> 45:21.500
Of anything that

45:21.500 --> 45:24.500
He's not a weird liar, Bruce

45:24.500 --> 45:26.500
If you're up there listening

45:26.500 --> 45:28.500
You're just weird

45:29.500 --> 45:30.500
So I feel bad

45:30.500 --> 45:31.500
I've also been wrong

45:31.500 --> 45:32.500
About other things offhand

45:32.500 --> 45:35.500
I repeated some thing

45:35.500 --> 45:37.500
Erin Negati always opts out

45:37.500 --> 45:39.500
When we go through the TSA checkpoints

45:39.500 --> 45:41.500
And she keeps saying this thing

45:41.500 --> 45:42.500
That I repeated on stage

45:42.500 --> 45:43.500
Which is that they're not

45:43.500 --> 45:44.500
A government agency

45:44.500 --> 45:45.500
They're a private company

45:45.500 --> 45:46.500
And then somebody tweeted me

45:46.500 --> 45:47.500
And said, what the fuck are you saying

45:47.500 --> 45:48.500
What are you, I looked it up

45:48.500 --> 45:50.500
And I said, that's not true either

45:50.500 --> 45:53.500
So one should be careful sometimes

45:53.500 --> 45:56.500
One should tens one's own garden

45:56.500 --> 45:58.500
That's how you stay honest

45:58.500 --> 45:59.500
You don't have to worry about

45:59.500 --> 46:01.500
Saying something that needs

46:01.500 --> 46:02.500
To be retracted

46:02.500 --> 46:06.500
Spencer's mom is a lesbian

46:06.500 --> 46:09.500
Yeah, so retraction there

46:09.500 --> 46:11.500
You didn't actually end up fucking it, right?

46:15.500 --> 46:18.500
Why do you think I would call her a lesbian?

46:18.500 --> 46:20.500
That's a title I reserve

46:20.500 --> 46:23.500
Only for women that won't do it with me

46:23.500 --> 46:26.500
Alright, well let's keep the bullet train

46:26.500 --> 46:29.500
Speeding along and bring up Kumail

46:29.500 --> 46:30.500
Because he's going to play D&D

46:30.500 --> 46:37.500
Alright, Kumail Nanjiani

46:37.500 --> 46:40.500
Hello, hello

46:40.500 --> 46:43.500
I thought that was the THX sound

46:43.500 --> 46:45.500
My congested ears heard that as the

46:45.500 --> 46:46.500
What was it?

46:46.500 --> 46:48.500
It's one of our rap beats

46:48.500 --> 46:50.500
Oh, rap beats

46:50.500 --> 46:52.500
Pretty racist

46:52.500 --> 46:55.500
By the way, I worked at a school

46:55.500 --> 46:57.500
That had laptops

46:57.500 --> 47:01.500
And I was responsible for about 300 laptops

47:01.500 --> 47:02.500
Macbooks

47:02.500 --> 47:06.500
And I probably lost about 70 of them

47:06.500 --> 47:08.500
And then quit

47:08.500 --> 47:10.500
Before they could count

47:10.500 --> 47:12.500
And I just, it sucks

47:12.500 --> 47:14.500
Because I became friends with these people

47:14.500 --> 47:15.500
I worked there for five years

47:15.500 --> 47:17.500
And I was really good at having them

47:17.500 --> 47:19.500
Not find out that shit was missing

47:19.500 --> 47:22.500
That was like the only thing I was good at

47:22.500 --> 47:23.500
And so when I was leaving

47:23.500 --> 47:25.500
It was this house of cards

47:25.500 --> 47:27.500
And I was like, hey, I'm going to quit

47:27.500 --> 47:28.500
They were like, what, but we need you

47:28.500 --> 47:29.500
And I was like, you're going to find out

47:29.500 --> 47:33.500
How little you need me

47:33.500 --> 47:35.500
When you figured out how much you wish

47:35.500 --> 47:37.500
I was here to answer questions

47:37.500 --> 47:38.500
Yeah, exactly

47:38.500 --> 47:39.500
And I just left

47:39.500 --> 47:41.500
And I ignored their calls

47:41.500 --> 47:44.500
And I just never fucking talked to them again

47:44.500 --> 47:45.500
It wasn't my fault

47:45.500 --> 47:47.500
I never stole or sold any of them

47:47.500 --> 47:49.500
They were just disappearing

47:49.500 --> 47:50.500
It can happen, man

47:50.500 --> 47:51.500
I don't know what was happening

47:51.500 --> 47:52.500
Crazy, right?

47:52.500 --> 47:54.500
I should have done PI more often

47:54.500 --> 47:55.500
Yeah

47:55.500 --> 47:57.500
I bet everybody's got a story

47:57.500 --> 47:58.500
About an early job they had

47:58.500 --> 47:59.500
Where they walked away from it

47:59.500 --> 48:01.500
With just, in fucking, like,

48:01.500 --> 48:02.500
It just broke down behind you

48:02.500 --> 48:03.500
I know

48:03.500 --> 48:05.500
If you think of like 70 computers

48:05.500 --> 48:08.500
Each one about $1,000 even

48:08.500 --> 48:12.500
That's over $70,000

48:12.500 --> 48:14.500
And I just left

48:14.500 --> 48:16.500
I moved to a different city

48:16.500 --> 48:18.500
And I changed my career

48:18.500 --> 48:20.500
And I bet if they see me on TV

48:20.500 --> 48:22.500
They're like, there's that fucker

48:22.500 --> 48:24.500
Because I swear to you

48:24.500 --> 48:26.500
That program went under

48:26.500 --> 48:28.500
The year after I left

48:28.500 --> 48:30.500
The birdie made off of Apple

48:30.500 --> 48:33.500
But I had to benefit from it

48:33.500 --> 48:34.500
So somebody there was pinching him

48:34.500 --> 48:35.500
Like somebody was

48:35.500 --> 48:36.500
I don't know

48:36.500 --> 48:37.500
This was on the south side of Chicago

48:37.500 --> 48:38.500
Which is like a pretty rough area

48:38.500 --> 48:40.500
And kids were always getting over

48:40.500 --> 48:41.500
It's the baddest part of town

48:41.500 --> 48:43.500
Yeah, bad, bad

48:43.500 --> 48:44.500
Yeah

48:44.500 --> 48:46.500
Leroy Brown, is that what we're doing?

48:46.500 --> 48:49.500
Yes, we're doing bad, bad, Leroy Brown right now

48:49.500 --> 48:51.500
Fuck you, man

48:51.500 --> 48:53.500
He's suckered me into that

48:53.500 --> 48:55.500
I hate Jim Croci

48:55.500 --> 48:57.500
I'm just saying, Camille

48:57.500 --> 48:58.500
If you go down there

48:58.500 --> 49:00.500
You better just beware

49:00.500 --> 49:03.500
Of a man named Leroy Brown

49:03.500 --> 49:07.500
These children don't know what you're talking about

49:07.500 --> 49:10.500
You're just being a weird old man right now

49:10.500 --> 49:12.500
My rendition is so accurate

49:12.500 --> 49:16.500
That you could shazam this conversation

49:16.500 --> 49:17.500
He got it back

49:17.500 --> 49:21.500
I had also shazam sort of thing, right?

49:21.500 --> 49:22.500
You still shazam?

49:22.500 --> 49:24.500
Was it called like Bahuqui?

49:24.500 --> 49:26.500
I don't know

49:26.500 --> 49:28.500
Bahuqui

49:28.500 --> 49:29.500
With cops, by the way

49:29.500 --> 49:31.500
I grew up, like I said, in Pakistan

49:31.500 --> 49:32.500
And it's so corrupt there

49:32.500 --> 49:34.500
Like the cops are just uniformly bad

49:34.500 --> 49:35.500
Pakistan in India

49:35.500 --> 49:37.500
If you watch any movies from the 80s and 90s

49:37.500 --> 49:39.500
The bad guys were always cops

49:39.500 --> 49:40.500
Always cops

49:40.500 --> 49:41.500
So I like moved

49:41.500 --> 49:42.500
And I fucking like

49:42.500 --> 49:43.500
I hate them

49:43.500 --> 49:45.500
And I'm like

49:45.500 --> 49:46.500
I don't know

49:46.500 --> 49:48.500
It's terrible because you can't think of a worse job

49:48.500 --> 49:50.500
A job that no one would rather do

49:50.500 --> 49:53.500
I think it's like school teachers, cops

49:53.500 --> 49:56.500
Let's throw in stylists

49:56.500 --> 49:58.500
Like we need to

49:58.500 --> 49:59.500
No, I'm kidding on the last one

49:59.500 --> 50:00.500
We need to

50:00.500 --> 50:03.500
Just school teachers and cops

50:03.500 --> 50:06.500
We obviously need them

50:06.500 --> 50:08.500
Don't you think you break the cycle

50:08.500 --> 50:10.500
By throwing a

50:10.500 --> 50:12.500
In a country where we kind of

50:12.500 --> 50:14.500
We do tend to

50:14.500 --> 50:16.500
I know that every penny counts

50:16.500 --> 50:18.500
But we also have spent

50:18.500 --> 50:19.500
More on worse

50:19.500 --> 50:21.500
Like don't you break the cycle by like going

50:21.500 --> 50:22.500
Hey from now on

50:22.500 --> 50:23.500
Being a cop

50:23.500 --> 50:24.500
Pays a lot

50:24.500 --> 50:26.500
Like don't you think

50:26.500 --> 50:28.500
Because right now we're at this place where it's like

50:28.500 --> 50:29.500
Doesn't pay that much

50:29.500 --> 50:30.500
And you might get shot

50:30.500 --> 50:31.500
Yeah

50:31.500 --> 50:33.500
So the people who go into it

50:33.500 --> 50:34.500
Like you need cops

50:34.500 --> 50:36.500
But a lot of people who become cops

50:36.500 --> 50:38.500
You don't want to be cops

50:38.500 --> 50:41.500
I was walking across the street

50:41.500 --> 50:42.500
I was jaywalking

50:42.500 --> 50:44.500
With my wife

50:44.500 --> 50:46.500
Who's not very threatening looking at all

50:46.500 --> 50:48.500
And these fucking cops pulled up

50:48.500 --> 50:50.500
And they started yelling at us

50:50.500 --> 50:53.500
And like they had me up against the wall

50:53.500 --> 50:54.500
Hands behind my back

50:54.500 --> 50:56.500
And I was so fucking angry

50:56.500 --> 50:57.500
I was asking them

50:57.500 --> 50:58.500
I swear I was like

50:58.500 --> 51:01.500
So this is the biggest bust you've had

51:01.500 --> 51:02.500
And I was like

51:02.500 --> 51:04.500
So is this why you got into the game

51:04.500 --> 51:07.500
I called it the game

51:07.500 --> 51:08.500
And Emily's like

51:08.500 --> 51:09.500
What'd you say?

51:09.500 --> 51:10.500
What'd you say?

51:10.500 --> 51:12.500
Of course Emily just

51:12.500 --> 51:15.500
And I'd just done a show at the echo

51:15.500 --> 51:17.500
And I'd left a bit early

51:17.500 --> 51:18.500
So while I'm there

51:18.500 --> 51:21.500
All the people who'd just seen me at the show

51:21.500 --> 51:22.500
Are walking by

51:22.500 --> 51:23.500
And they're like

51:23.500 --> 51:24.500
Hey great show

51:24.500 --> 51:25.500
I'm like okay cool

51:25.500 --> 51:28.500
Not a good time right now

51:28.500 --> 51:29.500
Pretty cool

51:29.500 --> 51:30.500
Oh my god

51:30.500 --> 51:31.500
The next week you were opening though

51:31.500 --> 51:32.500
Or wait

51:32.500 --> 51:33.500
Opening's bad

51:33.500 --> 51:36.500
Closing

51:36.500 --> 51:38.500
My brain is dying

51:38.500 --> 51:41.500
By the way have you seen posters for Sharknado?

51:41.500 --> 51:42.500
No

51:42.500 --> 51:45.500
There's a movie called Sharknado

51:45.500 --> 51:49.500
It's set in Oklahoma

51:49.500 --> 51:51.500
During tornado season

51:51.500 --> 51:53.500
Yeah and it's a tornado

51:53.500 --> 51:55.500
And the poster is

51:55.500 --> 51:57.500
There's a hand drawn like a tornado

51:57.500 --> 51:59.500
With like shark heads poking out of it

51:59.500 --> 52:00.500
Which you'd be like

52:00.500 --> 52:01.500
Are you saying it better is it real?

52:01.500 --> 52:02.500
No no no

52:02.500 --> 52:03.500
This is real

52:03.500 --> 52:04.500
Oh I thought you were just doing a fucking thing

52:04.500 --> 52:05.500
No no

52:05.500 --> 52:06.500
This is real

52:06.500 --> 52:07.500
That's the problem

52:07.500 --> 52:08.500
It's real

52:08.500 --> 52:09.500
Sharknado

52:09.500 --> 52:10.500
They would be like nothing

52:10.500 --> 52:13.500
They'd be dead right?

52:13.500 --> 52:14.500
Yes

52:14.500 --> 52:15.500
These sharks

52:15.500 --> 52:16.500
They're dizzy and dead

52:16.500 --> 52:20.500
If you're auditioning for the role of the mayor

52:20.500 --> 52:21.500
In the first act

52:21.500 --> 52:22.500
Yeah

52:22.500 --> 52:23.500
You're hired

52:23.500 --> 52:24.500
Guys we have nothing to worry about

52:24.500 --> 52:26.500
Come on they'd be dead

52:26.500 --> 52:27.500
They're dead

52:27.500 --> 52:29.500
Can I be the sharkologist?

52:29.500 --> 52:31.500
Yes the annual corn festival stays open

52:31.500 --> 52:35.500
We've known two things about sharks for 50,000 years

52:35.500 --> 52:37.500
One is that they live under water

52:37.500 --> 52:39.500
Two is that they can't stop moving

52:39.500 --> 52:42.500
We thought the first thing was what was keeping them alive

52:42.500 --> 52:44.500
You're good Jan

52:44.500 --> 52:47.500
It turns out they only have to keep moving

52:47.500 --> 52:50.500
No one has ever kept a shark moving out of water

52:50.500 --> 52:52.500
And just like a truck shark

52:52.500 --> 52:54.500
What if the tornado is water

52:54.500 --> 52:55.500
Whatever's a water tornado

52:55.500 --> 52:57.500
You're talking about a hurricane

52:57.500 --> 52:59.500
That's the sequel

52:59.500 --> 53:03.500
But there's one house that won't be taken over by the sharknado

53:03.500 --> 53:04.500
Shark house

53:04.500 --> 53:06.500
Monster house

53:06.500 --> 53:08.500
You should have a movie called Shark House

53:08.500 --> 53:10.500
I'll find the sharknado picture for you to prove

53:10.500 --> 53:12.500
That it wasn't just a lame bid I was doing

53:12.500 --> 53:13.500
It's a real movie

53:13.500 --> 53:14.500
No you don't have to prove it

53:14.500 --> 53:16.500
That's the sad thing is that now irony has become

53:16.500 --> 53:17.500
I think it's a good thing

53:17.500 --> 53:19.500
It's an invitation now to like

53:19.500 --> 53:22.500
I think that we used to live in a world where

53:22.500 --> 53:25.500
The division between the people who made entertainment

53:25.500 --> 53:27.500
And the people that consumed it was so thick

53:27.500 --> 53:30.500
That it was one of the most enjoyable things

53:30.500 --> 53:32.500
Was them doing their job wrong

53:32.500 --> 53:34.500
And now we can all do it anyway

53:34.500 --> 53:35.500
So now it's like

53:35.500 --> 53:37.500
Now of course the first thing we're going to do is go

53:37.500 --> 53:41.500
Hey this show is called Dick, Dick, Dick Gater

53:41.500 --> 53:43.500
Is it part Dick, part Gater?

53:43.500 --> 53:45.500
I thought it was a Gater who's like a dick

53:45.500 --> 53:47.500
Is it?

53:47.500 --> 53:49.500
Doosh crocodile

53:49.500 --> 53:50.500
But here's my problem

53:50.500 --> 53:51.500
If the reality is a thing

53:51.500 --> 53:52.500
Is it already out?

53:52.500 --> 53:53.500
Or is it no?

53:53.500 --> 53:54.500
Here's the poster

53:54.500 --> 53:55.500
I forgot to mention this

53:55.500 --> 53:57.500
The tagline is enough said

53:57.500 --> 53:59.500
No

53:59.500 --> 54:01.500
No I think we need a bit more

54:01.500 --> 54:02.500
No

54:02.500 --> 54:03.500
Look at that

54:03.500 --> 54:04.500
Not enough said

54:04.500 --> 54:05.500
Enough said

54:05.500 --> 54:06.500
Enough said

54:06.500 --> 54:07.500
No the sharks are dead

54:07.500 --> 54:09.500
Enough said exclamation point

54:09.500 --> 54:10.500
Which is another weird thing

54:10.500 --> 54:12.500
Enough said

54:12.500 --> 54:13.500
But how about this

54:13.500 --> 54:16.500
There is a thing that's already being made called

54:16.500 --> 54:18.500
Sharknado

54:18.500 --> 54:20.500
But the one Adam Goldberg was talking about

54:20.500 --> 54:22.500
Is called Avalanche Shark

54:22.500 --> 54:24.500
They didn't even go like Sharkalanche

54:24.500 --> 54:26.500
Or

54:26.500 --> 54:27.500
Shark

54:27.500 --> 54:30.500
Sharks are officially the new ninja

54:30.500 --> 54:32.500
But Avalanche colon shark

54:32.500 --> 54:34.500
Like Mission Colon Impossible

54:34.500 --> 54:35.500
I don't even know it was both

54:35.500 --> 54:36.500
And it was neither

54:36.500 --> 54:37.500
It was Avalanche shark

54:37.500 --> 54:38.500
Then it was Shark Avalanche

54:38.500 --> 54:40.500
Then it was Avalanche sharks

54:40.500 --> 54:41.500
When they had three puppets

54:41.500 --> 54:43.500
And then they cut back on the number of puppets

54:43.500 --> 54:46.500
And then they cut back on the number of production managers

54:46.500 --> 54:49.500
And that's when you jump a ship

54:49.500 --> 54:52.500
And then it became an evening with a shark

54:52.500 --> 54:54.500
Off-Broadway

54:54.500 --> 54:56.500
Just so yeah

54:56.500 --> 54:58.500
I was born a little shark

54:58.500 --> 55:00.500
And then it finally became Argo

55:00.500 --> 55:02.500
That's how Hollywood works

55:02.500 --> 55:04.500
Yeah, it's crazy

55:04.500 --> 55:06.500
Hood rewrite

55:06.500 --> 55:08.500
So I'm going to guess

55:08.500 --> 55:12.500
Tremors was a kind of a parody of Jaws

55:12.500 --> 55:15.500
Like Tremors was written like in the 70s

55:15.500 --> 55:16.500
Really?

55:16.500 --> 55:17.500
After Jaws was popular

55:17.500 --> 55:19.500
They wrote this script that was like

55:19.500 --> 55:22.500
They're sharks but they're under dirt instead of water

55:22.500 --> 55:24.500
And it took that long for Tremors to come out

55:24.500 --> 55:26.500
I like Tremors because

55:26.500 --> 55:28.500
This is the third one where they start flying

55:28.500 --> 55:29.500
Yeah

55:29.500 --> 55:31.500
And then the fourth one is

55:31.500 --> 55:33.500
Because Michael Gross is the only one who keeps coming back

55:33.500 --> 55:34.500
He's done all of them

55:34.500 --> 55:37.500
So there's one that's set in the Wild West

55:37.500 --> 55:38.500
It's a prequel

55:38.500 --> 55:40.500
And there's Tremors there

55:40.500 --> 55:43.500
And Michael Gross's ancestor fights him

55:43.500 --> 55:44.500
Which at that point

55:44.500 --> 55:45.500
Played by whom?

55:45.500 --> 55:46.500
Michael Gross

55:46.500 --> 55:47.500
He's back

55:47.500 --> 55:51.500
That should have like made the news or the lore

55:51.500 --> 55:52.500
And they should have been like

55:52.500 --> 55:53.500
Hey stay away from this area

55:53.500 --> 55:54.500
Like 200 years ago

55:54.500 --> 55:56.500
These fucking Tremors showed up

55:56.500 --> 55:58.500
And what are the odds that Michael Gross comes back

55:58.500 --> 55:59.500
Of guys out there

55:59.500 --> 56:00.500
Well a lot of problems

56:00.500 --> 56:01.500
They register the local radar of one guy

56:01.500 --> 56:02.500
Who stayed in this basement

56:02.500 --> 56:03.500
And started hoarding firearms

56:03.500 --> 56:04.500
It holds up

56:04.500 --> 56:08.500
I like the Tremors saga

56:11.500 --> 56:12.500
Shall we play some D&D?

56:12.500 --> 56:13.500
Let's do it

56:13.500 --> 56:14.500
Alright, Aaron McAthee

56:14.500 --> 56:15.500
Would you join us on stage please?

56:21.500 --> 56:22.500
Oh Jesus Christ

56:22.500 --> 56:24.500
Don't ever ever ever sneak up

56:24.500 --> 56:25.500
I'm gonna go

56:25.500 --> 56:26.500
Hello

56:26.500 --> 56:27.500
Aaron McAthee everyone

56:27.500 --> 56:28.500
Hey guys

56:30.500 --> 56:31.500
Sharks

56:31.500 --> 56:32.500
Yeah

56:33.500 --> 56:34.500
Her mic is not on

56:35.500 --> 56:36.500
Give it a try

56:36.500 --> 56:37.500
Sharks

56:37.500 --> 56:38.500
There we go

56:39.500 --> 56:40.500
Shark lobby

56:41.500 --> 56:42.500
It's good news though

56:42.500 --> 56:44.500
There'll have to be a new

56:44.500 --> 56:47.500
There's gonna be a nerd shark movie soon I bet

56:47.500 --> 56:48.500
Like a half nerd half shark

56:48.500 --> 56:49.500
He's just like

56:49.500 --> 56:51.500
Because nerds are the big thing right now

56:51.500 --> 56:53.500
Shack called himself a geek today

56:53.500 --> 56:54.500
So I'm like

56:54.500 --> 56:55.500
Come on

56:56.500 --> 56:58.500
Nerds will have to come up with new ways

56:58.500 --> 57:04.500
Like somehow the robot ninja Abraham Lincoln

57:04.500 --> 57:07.500
Shark laser

57:07.500 --> 57:08.500
Like kind of like

57:08.500 --> 57:09.500
That concept

57:09.500 --> 57:10.500
That all comes from the

57:10.500 --> 57:11.500
Pirate

57:11.500 --> 57:13.500
It comes from this period of time when it was like

57:13.500 --> 57:15.500
We were being dispensed to entertainment

57:15.500 --> 57:16.500
By this big thing

57:16.500 --> 57:18.500
So there's like this wacky packages irony

57:18.500 --> 57:19.500
Going on to it

57:19.500 --> 57:21.500
These aren't crayola crayons

57:21.500 --> 57:22.500
These are crackola crayons

57:22.500 --> 57:23.500
So I guess it's a

57:23.500 --> 57:25.500
We're living in a kind of a

57:25.500 --> 57:27.500
Satirically dead age

57:27.500 --> 57:30.500
That will be a precursor to like a new

57:30.500 --> 57:31.500
I think

57:31.500 --> 57:32.500
A new reckoning

57:32.500 --> 57:34.500
Where I will be completely like

57:34.500 --> 57:36.500
I'll just be a dinosaur

57:36.500 --> 57:37.500
As if I'm not already

57:37.500 --> 57:38.500
But I'll be absolutely

57:38.500 --> 57:39.500
I don't even know why that's funny

57:39.500 --> 57:40.500
And everyone will be like

57:40.500 --> 57:41.500
Exactly

57:41.500 --> 57:42.500
Step aside

57:43.500 --> 57:45.500
There's some shows on Adult Swim

57:45.500 --> 57:47.500
That make me feel so old

57:47.500 --> 57:48.500
I don't know

57:49.500 --> 57:50.500
Yeah

57:50.500 --> 57:52.500
I've watched like

57:52.500 --> 57:54.500
What like Squidbillies

57:56.500 --> 57:57.500
Have you seen that show?

57:57.500 --> 57:58.500
I don't know

57:58.500 --> 57:59.500
It's impenetrable

58:01.500 --> 58:02.500
I'll tell you something

58:02.500 --> 58:03.500
I watched that made me feel 20

58:03.500 --> 58:05.500
It was like the most powerful guy in the room

58:05.500 --> 58:08.500
This movie, the ABC's of horror

58:08.500 --> 58:09.500
Oh how is that?

58:10.500 --> 58:13.500
It should be called 26 Channel 101 rejections

58:13.500 --> 58:16.500
What also

58:16.500 --> 58:17.500
Sucks about that format

58:17.500 --> 58:18.500
Is that you're hyper aware

58:18.500 --> 58:20.500
Of how much of the movie is left

58:20.500 --> 58:21.500
Yeah

58:21.500 --> 58:22.500
Because you're like

58:22.500 --> 58:23.500
I'm only at the G

58:23.500 --> 58:24.500
Yeah

58:24.500 --> 58:25.500
The good thing about it

58:25.500 --> 58:26.500
Is knowing you're never

58:26.500 --> 58:27.500
More than three minutes away

58:27.500 --> 58:28.500
From another

58:31.500 --> 58:32.500
But you start to go

58:32.500 --> 58:33.500
Like it's not starting

58:33.500 --> 58:34.500
It's never going to start

58:34.500 --> 58:35.500
And even if it does start

58:35.500 --> 58:37.500
It's going to putter out

58:37.500 --> 58:38.500
Four minutes

58:38.500 --> 58:39.500
Yeah

58:39.500 --> 58:40.500
I think we started feeling pretty

58:40.500 --> 58:41.500
OCD about it

58:41.500 --> 58:43.500
Like we're already 20 in

58:43.500 --> 58:44.500
Well we started the first 11

58:44.500 --> 58:45.500
Kept going like

58:45.500 --> 58:46.500
So C is for

58:46.500 --> 58:47.500
Carnival

58:47.500 --> 58:48.500
C is for that

58:48.500 --> 58:49.500
And then we started going

58:49.500 --> 58:50.500
What are we doing?

58:50.500 --> 58:51.500
It doesn't matter

58:51.500 --> 58:52.500
Because somebody actually told me

58:52.500 --> 58:54.500
That it was a part of that project

58:54.500 --> 58:55.500
They said

58:55.500 --> 58:56.500
Yeah we got them and

58:56.500 --> 58:57.500
We had to shuffle the order

58:57.500 --> 58:58.500
Because we had to

58:58.500 --> 59:00.500
So we started pretending

59:00.500 --> 59:02.500
That the letter was different

59:02.500 --> 59:04.500
Like if you made a shitty one

59:04.500 --> 59:06.500
Called the H is for helicopter

59:06.500 --> 59:07.500
Because it couldn't guys head up

59:07.500 --> 59:08.500
But it was so shitty

59:08.500 --> 59:09.500
They would just go

59:09.500 --> 59:10.500
Let's just say

59:10.500 --> 59:11.500
P is for pilot

59:11.500 --> 59:12.500
Yeah

59:12.500 --> 59:14.500
And let's tell the P guy

59:14.500 --> 59:16.500
That it might fly on that one

59:16.500 --> 59:17.500
Wow that sucks

59:18.500 --> 59:19.500
Yeah it was very clear

59:19.500 --> 59:20.500
That the words didn't inspire

59:20.500 --> 59:21.500
The horror

59:21.500 --> 59:23.500
Also barely any horror

59:23.500 --> 59:25.500
Literally like four or five

59:26.500 --> 59:27.500
And I say in quotes

59:27.500 --> 59:28.500
Scary ones

59:28.500 --> 59:30.500
There was a cartoon about a woman

59:30.500 --> 59:32.500
Trying to get her poop inside a toilet

59:32.500 --> 59:33.500
What do you mean?

59:33.500 --> 59:34.500
That

59:36.500 --> 59:37.500
Is the poop out of her

59:37.500 --> 59:38.500
Or is it in her?

59:38.500 --> 59:40.500
There's a woman

59:40.500 --> 59:41.500
It was animated

59:41.500 --> 59:42.500
Is this P?

59:43.500 --> 59:44.500
No this is poop

59:44.500 --> 59:45.500
No it's P

59:46.500 --> 59:47.500
No

59:47.500 --> 59:48.500
Nice nice

59:49.500 --> 59:50.500
Classic

59:50.500 --> 59:51.500
Thank you very much

59:51.500 --> 59:53.500
We're gonna be touring together

59:53.500 --> 59:55.500
Shoes and socks ladies and gentlemen

59:55.500 --> 59:56.500
Yeah

59:56.500 --> 59:57.500
Cheese shoes

59:57.500 --> 59:58.500
And I'm Camille

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.500
What do you say Camille?

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.500
Shoes you gotta get in

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.500
Alright it's D&D time

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.500
I'd say on that note

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.500
That's my catchphrase

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.500
Spencer if you would

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.500
Catch us up

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.500
When we last met

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.500
The group was plumbing

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.500
The depths of the ruins of Mershuil

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500
Christopher was caught

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.500
In a deadly wall crashing trap

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.500
Thinking quickly

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.500
The rogue found a narrow escape

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500
And left with great alacrity

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.500
Through a hole in the floor

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.500
Landing in a dank dark chamber

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.500
Sharpie quirk and Mulraine

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.500
Were not far behind

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.500
And after some crossed wires

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.500
The group managed to slide down

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500
The button staff

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.500
Working on unlocking the chamber door

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.500
The rogue toiled

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.500
While the rest of the gang

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.500
Searched the room

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.500
It wasn't long before the group

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.500
Was besieged by snakes

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.500
After seeming to fall

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.500
For Mulraine's animal husbandry

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.500
The snakes transformed into Yuan T

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.500
Sinister serpent people

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.500
After putting on a seemingly

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.500
Clever disguise

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.500
The hat of disguise

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.500
The gang tried to convince the snakes

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500
They were holding a hostage

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.500
But quarks talking dagger

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.500
Ruined the gang

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.500
With his sharp tongue

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.500
And foul move

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.500
Down but not out

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.500
They launched into a new gag

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.500
Quark creeping behind the lead snake

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.500
And Sharpie pushing him over the

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.500
Crouch hapland

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.500
Tripping him

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.500
This spooked the snake people

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.500
Into losing their volos of poison arrows

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.500
Which struck Sharpie in his chest and arm

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.500
He began to feel drowsy

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.500
And as if he was feeling numb

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.500
The party managed to kill two of the foes

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.500
Before the last member of the group

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.500
Fled in snake form

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.500
Managing to elude the party's grasp

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.500
After combat ended

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.500
The rogue managed to finish

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.500
Picking the lock on the door

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:37.500
Peering through the clack

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.500
Crack at the massive treasure room

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.500
For them

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.500
Just then Sharpie felt a rush of dizziness

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.500
And lost consciousness

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.500
Thump

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.500
He did it again!

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.500
Alright

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500
I'm convinced Spencer

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500
That you've listened to this podcast

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500
You've timed out the music cue

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500
And you write this

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.500
To be timed perfectly to this

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.500
I mean, the thing is

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.500
I write it on my iPad nowadays

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.500
And I just write the same size of the text

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.500
It works amazing

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.500
I heard there's a video of you

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.500
The way there is of Bruce Springsteen

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500
Practicing his opening

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.500
No? Okay

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.500
There's an urban legend

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.500
Or a real tape out there

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.500
I don't know if it's just an urban legend

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.500
Or if there's a real tape

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500
But somebody slept over at Bruce Springsteen's house

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.500
And found a tape of him

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:32.500
A VHS tape of him practicing

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.500
Dancing in the dark in a mirror

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.500
Really?

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.500
Circulating around

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.500
It's probably an urban legend

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.500
From like back in the day?

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.500
Yeah, yeah

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.500
Was it like the Metallica drummer guy?

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.500
The guy that drummed the entire black album?

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.500
We know that exists, right?

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.500
Yeah, that was fucking great

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.500
Alright, so what's going on?

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.500
We're looking through a crack in the thing

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.500
Bruce Springsteen?

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.500
He was a guy

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.500
During Reaganomics

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.500
We had to make sure it was extra cool

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.500
To be lower class

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.500
Reaganomics

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.500
So he rolled out some rich people

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.500
With bandanas

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.500
That was the best class in history

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.500
Was Reaganomics

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.500
I mean glossary term

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.500
Who?

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.500
Can we see that Sharpie's fallen down?

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.500
Who is Sharpie?

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.500
Yeah, that's Dan

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.500
Oh, okay

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:25.500
Can I have like an HBO original series dream sequence?

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.500
Yeah, you're in a dungeon though

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.500
I mean like

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.500
You're having a dream sequence

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.500
But I'm unconscious

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.500
Okay, so yeah

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.500
So I'm on a beach

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.500
We don't know that

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.500
And then someone is getting stabbed

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.500
And look out over the ocean

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.500
And instead of the sun rising over it

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:50.500
It's my dad's head

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.500
And I start to run away

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:55.500
And I run through a nearby jungle

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.500
And I come to a cabin

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.500
And I go inside and there's a birthday cake

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.500
And there's 13 candles on it

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500
And a fish in the middle

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.500
And I pick up the fish

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.500
And it looks at me and says

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.500
Sopranos reference

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.500
So I put it down

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500
And I go with my second thought

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.500
I go to a fireplace

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.500
And I start to stoke the flame

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.500
But there's nothing but oatmeal in it

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.500
Then I wake up

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.500
Or cut to them

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.500
Cut to them

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.500
Hey, what do you guys think he's dreaming about?

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.500
Same old stuff, probably

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.500
So I'm working on the log

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500
What's, huh?

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:43.500
I'm working on the lock

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.500
You had just picked the lock

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.500
And you guys had opened it

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.500
And you would see it in the room

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.500
Yeah, there's treasure

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.500
Let me see here

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.500
You can see a large stone chamber

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.500
In the center of which is three large humanoid statues

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.500
And next to them is a small wooden shed

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.500
And a few wooden buckets

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.500
Behind the statues is a massive stone staircase

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.500
Leading up about 80 feet in large tiered steps

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.500
At the top is a massive sarcophagus

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.500
Made of obsidian, it's surrounded by several chests and barrels

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.500
And baskets of goods, I should say

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.500
Heaped up in some form of tribute

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.500
In the middle of the staircase is a massive deep black crack

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.500
And inky darkness blocks out any light

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.500
That you could help see into the small cave

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.500
You see coins tossed around the cavern

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.500
I mean the chamber

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.500
It's a chamber

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.500
Do I have any sort of antidote or something I can use on them?

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.500
I don't know

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.500
I mean, what is, does it say anything like that?

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.500
You should know

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.500
I mean, what is, does it say anything like that?

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.500
You shouldn't

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.500
I shouldn't?

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.500
I don't think so

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.500
Well, you created me, so I'm sure I don't

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.500
Yeah, but it happened a while ago

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.500
I have heel-moderate wounds, do I not?

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:50.500
Yeah, but this is more of like a sleep, a sleeping poison

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.500
Oh, it's not deadly

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.500
Well, you don't know, really

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.500
You saw, it's freaky, you know

01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:00.500
I reach into my sack and take out a pen

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.500
And I draw a dick and balls on his forehead

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.500
I teabag him

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.500
Yeah

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.500
And I put like a cover of him in swastikas

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:12.500
And we tried to get the horse to fuck

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.500
I take his hand and I pretend that we're getting married

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.500
I put his other hand in a bucket of warm water

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.500
And then I just piss on his hand

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:30.500
Not intuitively, I piss on his hand

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.500
This weirdly brings the three of us together

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.500
No, because that's a way to revive somebody

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.500
In a barbarian clan, so we would frequently

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.500
To pee on someone's hand was a great way

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.500
To bring them out of a stupor

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.500
Was it a great way?

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.500
Sounds like the worst way

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.500
It was the only way

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500
Okay

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.500
We should probably look through, go up

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.500
He'll be here

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500
Yeah, I examine the statues

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.500
Okay, so you examine the statues

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.500
They're beginning to fall apart

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.500
There's several cracks, and you can see

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.500
The faces are worn off

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.500
Do you want to enter the room?

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500
Yes, I enter the room

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.500
You enter the room

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.500
Hey, your pee kind of like rubbed off

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.500
The dick on his face, do you want to redraw it?

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.500
I go back in and I re-ink the dick and balls on his forehead

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.500
Because that's going to be hilarious

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.500
Would one of my sleep arrows do the opposite?

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.500
Like riddle in or something?

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.500
You don't know

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.500
We should shoot him with it just to be safe

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.500
Wait, you're going to shoot him with arrows?

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.500
With a sleep arrow

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.500
Like a light switch

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.500
I do my best to murmur things in my sleep

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:47.500
To make it clear I was bullied as a child

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.500
And or molested

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.500
Not another bath, mom

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:57.500
I'm already clean

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.500
You guys hear this and feel bad for your pranks

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.500
How clean can you get?

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.500
I put on...

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:06.500
I feel dirtier after you clean me

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:10.500
Can I put on my hat of disguise and become Dan's mother?

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.500
Okay

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.500
Okay, it was bound to happen

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.500
That's technically something that can happen, yes

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.500
I'm just saying maybe it would wake him

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.500
Alright, did I do it?

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.500
Yeah, well your disguise is what you think she looks like

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:29.500
You don't actually know for sure

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:36.500
That's just sharpie without a beard

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.500
What happened when you examined the statues?

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.500
I went back in to redraw the dick and balls

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.500
But now I go back in while this is happening

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.500
Slightly creeped out by a woman in love with a man

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.500
Pretending to be his mother while he's asleep

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.500
He's not creeped out enough to not pee on him

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:01.500
No, okay, I go into the room to look at the statues while that goes on

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.500
Okay, there's three statues

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:07.500
A couple seem cowed in admiration or maybe subservience

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.500
The one is larger than the other two

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.500
Arms are stretched out in triumph

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:16.500
You can see words scrawled on the base of the statue

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.500
But you can't really read their language

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.500
I can read that language, right?

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.500
I mean, you don't know

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.500
You haven't seen the right...

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.500
There's some writing you might like

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:30.500
Oh, hey, I'm a writer, you know

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.500
I attempt to read the writing

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.500
It says Mershalk

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.500
It says Mershalk

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.500
What does that mean?

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.500
You realize that it's part of the history of this plane

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:48.500
Mershalk is an ancient and dark god worshipped by the Yuan-ti

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.500
We're fucked

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.500
I kneel down next to Sharpie

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.500
Oh, hi

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.500
I have a clean, I'm clean

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:07.500
Becoming his oppressor is not going to help the situation

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.500
I'm going to undo it

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500
Yeah, fix it

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.500
Oh, hey, good job in that bath in there

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.500
Good job

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:22.500
I like, like, praising someone after they've been molested

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.500
Took it like a champ

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:29.500
Have you done this before?

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:33.500
I just wanted to let you know that what happened in there

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.500
doesn't make me love you any more or less

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.500
I just want to promise it's not going to happen again

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:43.500
I just want to impress you with my spells

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.500
Oh, I know

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.500
You know what? I exist in every enemy that you encounter

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.500
Any hole that's too dark

01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:00.500
I love my enemies, I hate myself

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500
Oh, no, no, no, no

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.500
I want you to compartmentalize me, okay?

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.500
Compartmentalize all humanity

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.500
Compartmentalize everyone

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.500
I'm letting you go

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.500
I have no more feelings

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.500
No, hey, not to butt in

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.500
I don't think this is working

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500
But keep trying

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:28.500
Okay, I don't think you should be so turned on right now

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.500
Touch it

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.500
Okay, no

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.500
I awkwardly walk over to where he is

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.500
It's dirty

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.500
Clean it

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:48.500
It'll always be dirty

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.500
Clean it

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.500
You know, any positive feelings that you have about me

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.500
I want you to transfer them to Mulraine

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.500
And any negative feelings

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:04.500
I want you to imagine them going into a dark devil's box

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.500
Mulraine's devil's box

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.500
Clean my penis

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:12.500
Not a vagina, just an actual box

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.500
And imagine it being set on fire

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.500
And then being eaten by a monster

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.500
And it goes away forever

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:24.500
Women clean my penis, vaginas are on fire

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.500
No, okay

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.500
I take the hat off

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.500
Hey, how did that go?

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:37.500
We'll find out when he wakes up

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.500
I made some big mistakes, you guys

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.500
I thought I understood Sharpie

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:43.500
I don't think I do

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.500
I'm very sorry

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.500
No one understands Sharpie

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.500
He's a mysterious fellow

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.500
He wants to help

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.500
But for all of his gifts

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:59.500
There's a deep pain that he masks

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.500
I've tried to clean that penis so many times

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.500
Every time he falls asleep

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.500
When he has one of those dreams

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.500
I'll clean it, I'll do it

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.500
And I'm constantly jerking him off while he sleeps

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.500
Never seems to get him

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.500
It just makes it worse

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.500
Never clean

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.500
Okay, I'll be right over

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.500
Maybe I should try it

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:24.500
I've never cleaned this penis

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:28.500
Can I give Chris my hat of disguise

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.500
So he can become Dan's mother?

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.500
Maybe she should try a different disguise

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.500
No, I think this is what's going on

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.500
I give Chris my hat of disguise

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.500
Oh, hey, I'm back

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:45.500
Never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:49.500
I've never seen you shining so bright

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.500
You're amazing

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500
I don't look dirty

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:57.500
Uh, hey, I don't want to do this

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.500
I feel like I need a shower

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.500
I grab whoever's near me in my dream

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.500
And hold them tight

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:14.500
Uh, oh fuck

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.500
Uh, Chris, run!

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:21.500
Hey dude, uh, uh, uh

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:25.500
I stab his arm

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.500
Do we need to roll a die?

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500
With a knife?

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.500
Well, but just very lightly

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:34.500
Yeah, no, he's asleep, so it's not a task to hit him

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:35.500
So I hit him

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.500
Yeah, you strike him, I'm sorry, you strike him

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:40.500
Well, I'll just, yeah, but not to hurt him

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.500
Yeah, okay, great

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.500
You do four non-legal damage

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.500
Uh, uh, uh, that means you love me

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.500
You wake up

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:51.500
Now you're awake

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.500
Oh, hey!

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.500
Did you have any weird dreams or anything?

01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.500
Yeah, the usual

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.500
Okay

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.500
You want to go out, maybe just go freshen up

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500
Do you want to take five?

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.500
There's a room with a mirror in there

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.500
You guys didn't

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.500
No, we'll do it

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.500
Uh, you assholes

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.500
I go and look in a reflective pool

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.500
You have like swastikas and dicks

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:21.500
That swastikas made of dicks

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.500
You're in a right state

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.500
I'm going to keep these here forever

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.500
That's the way, own it

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.500
I want you to feel bad next time I'm saving your life

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:34.500
You could be a guy with dicks on his face

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.500
That you drew

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.500
They come off

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:42.500
No, I'm making them permanent with a magic spell

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.500
With like a magic marker?

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.500
Yeah

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.500
Maybe a Sharpie?

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.500
I'm going to make them magical through a special ritual

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.500
Called not bathing

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.500
Um, can we, so we looked at the statues

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.500
And it says that in the stairs that go upstairs, right?

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.500
Yeah, yeah, but they have a giant crack in them

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.500
So we can't jump over the crack?

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.500
Well, I mean, you have rope I guess

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:10.500
So you could probably

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.500
Should we go up or we, I have rope

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.500
Okay, let's try it

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.500
How about this, I'll hold the rope

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.500
I'll fasten the rope, I take the rope

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.500
We tie one end to Chris de Burgh

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.500
And I tie it around me

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.500
And also fasten it to one of the statues

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.500
The cowering one to the side

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.500
And as an anchor point for the rope

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:30.500
So we can walk up

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.500
If anything bad happens Chris de Burgh

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:33.500
I'll reel you back in

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:34.500
As you tie the ropes

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.500
You feel a chill cove over the room

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.500
And you feel an odd presence

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.500
You can hear a voice

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.500
Oh, sorry, do you want to go?

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.500
Go ahead

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:44.500
Sorry, but no, it's fine, it's fine

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.500
You hear a voice echoing through the chamber

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:51.500
What new morsels have been tossed into my cell?

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.500
You hear thudding footfalls

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.500
And the clinking of metal rumbling against metal

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.500
Is that the guy from the pepperage farm commercials?

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500
Pepperage farm?

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.500
Luckily you're covered in piss

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.500
That's true

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.500
Out of the crack in the staircase

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.500
protrudes a draconic head

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.500
followed by a large green form

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.500
that you know all too well

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.500
A dragon

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.500
Its toothy jaw opens in anticipation

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.500
and bright green globs of saliva

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:21.500
tripped onto the floor

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.500
sizzling and bubbling on impact

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.500
Its temples are crowned with a frilled hood

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:26.500
that extends like a cobra's

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.500
laterally down the body

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.500
An odor of chlorine clings to its scaly hide

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.500
and glimmers with an emerald sheen

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500
Around its neck you can see an iron collar

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.500
and a few long chains

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.500
dangling around as the beast moves

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.500
Hey, how about you try going up first?

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.500
Well, yeah, he already came out

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.500
I'd say get back here and let's regroup

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.500
for a concerted attack here

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.500
Is he within...

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.500
I get back with him

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.500
Is he within arrow shot?

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.500
He is, yeah

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.500
Is he chained up? He's got chains around him?

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.500
He has chains around his neck

01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.500
but you can't see whether or not

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.500
they're attached to anything at the moment

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.500
I shoot two sleep arrows

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.500
Two sleep arrows

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:07.500
If he falls asleep I'm going to draw

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.500
some of these dicks on him

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.500
One of the arrows strikes

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.500
and hits him right in the neck

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.500
He doesn't have any effect

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.500
He stays awake

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.500
I do a far sword attack

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.500
Far sword attack

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.500
Pulling your flaming greatsword

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.500
from its sheath

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.500
you unfurl a far sword attack

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.500
The streaking blade of wind

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.500
goes awry and hits a wall or something

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.500
It's wind, you can't see what it, you know

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.500
Yeah, yeah, I gotcha

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.500
Hey, Sharpey

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.500
Should we look at this book

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.500
and see maybe there's something in this book?

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:49.500
I think it might be for another time

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.500
I don't know if we have time to do that

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.500
in combat

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.500
Am I wrong about that?

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.500
I mean, hang out and...

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.500
Okay

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.500
He opens his mouth wickedly

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:02.500
and sprays a corrosive green spray of acid

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.500
but you all manage to dive out of the way

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:08.500
Is it possible for me to wear my hat of disguise

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.500
and look like the dragon's mother?

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.500
It's limited to humanoid forms, so

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.500
Okay

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.500
No

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.500
Not being the answer there

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:20.500
I have a disguise

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.500
You dodged his breath weapon, that sucks

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.500
That's crazy, you could all died there

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:25.500
Really?

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:26.500
Yeah, it's sad

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.500
Why does that suck? What kind of person are you?

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.500
I'm a sadistic person

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.500
Hey, what's up? I have a poison dagger

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.500
Yeah, you do

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.500
Can I throw it at him?

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.500
You can throw it at him, you can stab him with it

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.500
You can do other things

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.500
What's stronger?

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:45.500
It would be stronger to strike him with it

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.500
but that would also, you know, you'd have to be in range of him

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:48.500
You don't want to get too close for it

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.500
That's a dangerous prospect

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.500
What do you guys think? Should I throw it?

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:53.500
I think you should throw it

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:56.500
I attach a rope to the dagger and throw it so I can get the dagger back

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.500
Quickly tying a knot around the dagger

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:02.500
You tie a knot around the dagger

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:03.500
Is that my turn?

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.500
No, okay, now you throw it

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:09.500
It only goes a pitiful like six or seven feet

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.500
Also the knot undoes itself

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:15.500
I feel like the...

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.500
I feel like the pitiful was editorializing

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:21.500
No, no, no, you rolled a four on the tie rope to dagger

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.500
and a three on the throw dagger to dragon

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.500
So that's the dice

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.500
How many dice do you have over there?

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.500
I got so many dice, man

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.500
How many dice do you need?

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:34.500
Let me ask you something about my spell, reduced person

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.500
Can I cast it on myself?

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.500
You can

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.500
I think you already got that cast on you five minutes ago

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.500
It was reduced self-esteem

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:49.500
We did future damage

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.500
I'm going to cast it on myself

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:58.500
My plan is to get around behind his line of sight

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.500
as a tiny thing

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.500
so small that in the dragon's world

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.500
it's negligible

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.500
Alright, well then I'll remind you that

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.500
you know it would shrink you down

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:10.500
but only to about a little smaller than a quirk size

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.500
It's just like a little guy

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.500
What did you do?

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.500
You look like Willow

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.500
Alright, alright, okay

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:24.500
Why don't you cast one of your crazy animal spells?

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:27.500
Alright, I'll cast Summoned Monster too

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.500
Summoned Monster too

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:30.500
Okay, let's see here

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.500
Celestial Giant B

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.500
Celestial Giant Bombardier Beetle

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.500
Riding Dog

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.500
Eagle

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:37.500
Devil

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:38.500
Squid

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:39.500
Wolf

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.500
Monster

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.500
Scorpion

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.500
Fiendish Shark

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:43.500
Monstrous Spider

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.500
Fiendish Snake

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.500
I'm going to go with...

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.500
No, come on guys

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.500
No, no, no ironic monster summonings

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.500
Waterborne Beasts that will simply lay there and die

01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:59.500
I summon the Scorpion

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.500
The Giant Scorpion

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.500
Summoning a Giant Scorpion

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.500
With a snap and a swish

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.500
It appears

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.500
Hey, could you have him pick up my knife on the way back?

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.500
On the way back

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.500
It doesn't have to do it on the way back

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.500
It awaits your orders

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.500
Huh?

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:18.500
It awaits his orders

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.500
Attack the dragon

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:23.500
Will you, Keith?

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.500
I grab the knife on the way back

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.500
And see if you can grab Christopher's knife

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.500
On the way back

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.500
You don't know how to do it on the way back

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.500
On the way back from killing the dragon

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.500
I take out my loot and I sing

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:38.500
Keith, attack the dragon

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.500
Because I fuck you all

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.500
I'm sorry

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:43.500
With its wicked sting

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.500
The Scorpion attempts to attack the dragon

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.500
But it bats the sting aside

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.500
With a flutter of its wing

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.500
I fire two V-arrows

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.500
Into...

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:56.500
Spencer, for real, I'm aiming...

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.500
I'm really aiming this time

01:22:58.500 --> 01:22:59.500
Like, right at his eyes

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:02.500
Do I have to explain to you dice again?

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.500
Dungeon Snap

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.500
Dungeon Snap

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.500
Spencer

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.500
Well, that's probability

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.500
No, I know

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:12.500
It's just the way you...

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:14.500
That's why it was funny, I hope

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.500
Yeah, totally

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.500
They laughed, Spencer

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.500
Keep on doing it

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.500
Yeah, okay

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.500
One of your arrows flies to the left

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.500
And misses its mark

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.500
But the other plants itself right in the dragon's chest

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.500
How much damage does it deal?

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.500
Probably a lot

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.500
So much damage?

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:33.500
Eight damage

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.500
Ooh

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.500
I take out my mysterious Emerald Dagger

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.500
And I ask it for advice

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.500
I didn't realize it talked

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.500
Can I consult my dagger?

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:42.500
Yeah, man

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:43.500
Hey, hey, hey

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry to be a dick

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:48.500
I, you know, I just like stabbing people

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:50.500
Well, how do you feel about stabbing daggers?

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:51.500
I mean, dragons

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:52.500
I can stab a dragon

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.500
I mean, do you want me to stab that dragon?

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:54.500
What if... how about this?

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.500
I'll go into a Berserker Rage

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.500
And you...

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.500
And we'll do some dual tag team

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:01.500
Dragon stabbing

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:02.500
Hey, on the way back

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.500
Could you pick up my...

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.500
Yes, yes

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.500
Well, I'm gonna be in a Berserker Rage

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:10.500
You'll probably be the last guy you wanna...

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:11.500
On the way back

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.500
You don't have to do it on the way there

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.500
All right, okay, okay

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.500
Thanks

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.500
Actually, before I do that

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.500
I just go over, pick up this dagger

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:21.500
And bring it back to Christopher

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:22.500
Okay, but you can't attack now

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:23.500
Oh, shit

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:24.500
No, no

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:25.500
Oh, wait, oh, wait, oh, wait, oh, wait

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.500
All right

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:29.500
Yeah, so me, Sassy Dagger

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.500
And Berserker Rage, Dragon Attack

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.500
Flying into a Berserker Rage

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.500
You all about lose your consciousness

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:36.500
Before you launch yourself

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.500
Directly into the clutches of the dragon

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.500
Oh, so much good

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.500
Just some math here

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.500
Yeah, yeah, no, you strike it

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.500
Right in the neck

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:49.500
Scoring a seemingly deep slash

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:50.500
On its flank

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:53.500
You manage to deal...

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.500
That's not too much, you guys

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:56.500
11 damage

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.500
Oh, shit

01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.500
That's still pretty good

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.500
Can I try to intimidate it?

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.500
I says I can intimidate

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.500
You definitely can try to intimidate it

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:04.500
What do you want to...

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.500
What kind of thing do you want to do?

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.500
What do you want to...

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:09.500
What kind of thing do you just want to be like

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:10.500
Hey, hey

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.500
Or do you want to like say something?

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.500
You know, you could have arguments

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.500
Or you could just make noise, I mean...

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.500
I could be like, hey, I had a song

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.500
It was number one on the charts for...

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.500
For a long time

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.500
So back off

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:30.500
What's your intimidate score?

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.500
You know, on the skills

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.500
It doesn't say anything

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.500
Do you not have any ranks in it?

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:36.500
No, it's checked

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:37.500
Okay, it's checked

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:39.500
So you go, then that's just your

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.500
Charisma modifier

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.500
What?

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:43.500
As I'm intimidating him

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:46.500
I sneakily grab my knife

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.500
He seems to flinch back a bit

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:49.500
As you intimidate it

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:52.500
And you manage to grab your knife

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.500
He repents

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.500
Is it possible?

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.500
I don't know dragons all that well

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.500
Is it possible that he's being chained there

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.500
And he's been imprisoned by something?

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:08.500
But what if we...

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:10.500
We could use diplomacy to...

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:11.500
You're raging

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.500
Oh, sorry, yeah, that's the thing

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.500
Is it possible if we free him

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.500
That maybe he would be like cool?

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.500
Yeah, let's get a thorn out of his paw

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.500
We just gonna attack this ass

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.500
Before he attacked you, I should mention

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:24.500
Yeah, I know

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.500
Fuck this guy

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.500
So, fuck Emmer

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.500
I put it at dance turn

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:33.500
I have a thing in my inventory

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.500
It says four paralyzers

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:36.500
Yeah

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:37.500
What are those?

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:38.500
Do you remember when you were in the

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:39.500
Infinifish and you went to the store

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.500
You bought some rope

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.500
Some potions and some paralyzers

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:44.500
Okay

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.500
Those were syringes

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:49.500
Full of presumably paralyzing fluid

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:50.500
Okay

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:55.500
Do they come in ready injectable syringes?

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.500
They come in large syringes, yeah

01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:59.500
You can just buy that stuff

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.500
That's like if you buy condoms and rope

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.500
They should let you do that, right?

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:06.500
I give one to Christopher because he's

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.500
He has skills that will enable him

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.500
To get in close to this thing that I don't have

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.500
Yeah, I can sneak

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.500
Go stab this thing

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.500
Cool

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.500
This d-word

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.500
Can I use my sneaking?

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.500
I use my sneaking to go and stab him

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.500
With the paralyzer injection

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.500
So you hand him the paralyzer and you

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.500
Attempt to sneak

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.500
Oh, hey, that's a good sneak

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.500
You can't be seen

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.500
You definitely can't be seen

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.500
The dragon is occupied with quark right now

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:37.500
And attempts to attack him with a few of his limbs

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.500
This could be dangerous, you guys

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.500
Artificial tension

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.500
That's a great filmmaking device

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:48.500
The director should just come on and be like

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.500
This is very scary

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.500
It's called the M-Nite

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:58.500
He strikes at you with his wings and his claws

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.500
And he manages to not hit you with those

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.500
I mean, he doesn't manage to hit you with those

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.500
But then he nips at you with his powerful beak

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.500
He bites you right in the hand

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.500
Not your dagger hand, of course

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.500
Well, not, of course

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.500
I mean, that's a reasonable thing that could happen

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.500
Dealing seven damage

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.500
Ooh

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:24.500
My chances

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.500
Yeah, so now you're sneaking

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:27.500
Might be me?

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.500
Yeah, now you're sneaking

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:30.500
Now you're nearby him

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:33.500
You think you might be able to do something

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.500
And as best as you can tell, he hasn't taken notice

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.500
All right, I stab him with the paralyzer

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.500
Like in the face?

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.500
Right in the dick

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.500
Right, sorry

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.500
I'm sorry, where is it softest?

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.500
Eye?

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500
I mean, the dick might be the softest part

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.500
Depends how much he likes fighting

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.500
Yeah, yeah

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.500
What is your comedy team's cause?

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.500
Yeah, fighting dicks

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:07.500
You stab him right in the dick with the paralyzer

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.500
Now we're talking

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:14.500
You guys have stabbed him in the dick

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:18.500
Before depressing the plunger and injecting him full of

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.500
Paralyzing fluids

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.500
Through the dick

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:26.500
Take that!

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.500
His dick goes numb

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:31.500
That's all?

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.500
Well, I mean, for right now

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.500
Hey guys, I numbed his dick

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.500
He's gonna last a lot

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:40.500
Well, now everyone's common fears

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:44.500
If you have any spermicide, I could maybe do that too

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:47.500
Why don't you buy him a Ferrari while you're at it?

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:52.500
So it didn't work?

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:54.500
Well, I mean, it hasn't completely taken...

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.500
Poisons take a while to work

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:57.500
Oh, I see

01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:00.500
Let him circulate from his dick to his dragon brain

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.500
Is it... whose turn is that?

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.500
Aaron? Yeah, Aaron's

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.500
Sorry, I'm just...

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:07.500
Oh, that's okay

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:11.500
I shoot a single, and this is hard for me

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:17.500
I shoot one arrow between his eyes

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.500
Oh, hey, you hit him between his eyes

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.500
Hey

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.500
Dealing some damage

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.500
Dealing 11 damage

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:29.500
All right

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:32.500
That's pretty good, you guys

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.500
Now he has an arrow sticking out of his face

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:35.500
And a big gash in his neck, right?

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.500
And a numb dick

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.500
That's a state of affairs, yeah

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:45.500
I was gonna have to disguise myself as the sexiest dragon

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.500
What about my scorpion? What's my scorpion doing?

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.500
It's... you haven't given it orders, I guess

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.500
Well, you haven't attacked

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:54.500
Wait, the scorpion's just been hanging up while this is going on

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.500
Well, we're stabbing it in the dick

01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:59.500
Well, there's a giant scorpion just standing there

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.500
Waiting for orders

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:05.500
The scorpion's still drinking my last quarterly taxes

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:09.500
It's like, this is not the best use of my talents, but okay

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:14.500
I write off my mileage

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:18.500
I tell Keith the scorpion to please attack the dragon for God's sakes

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:19.500
What am I doing here?

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:20.500
He misses

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.500
Oh!

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.500
He's rusty

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:27.500
Yeah, he got cold

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.500
If you weren't summoned, I'd fire you

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:33.500
You had him on the bench for too long

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:37.500
Keith's good at writing songs and making bracelets and stuff

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.500
Am I still in my berserk rage?

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:40.500
Yeah

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.500
Okay, then I go back for another sword attack

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:43.500
Going

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.500
Yeah, going

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:49.500
I use my climbing ability to climb up to the tallest statue

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:53.500
and then leap at him to try to plunge my sword right in the top of the dragon's head

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:58.500
Okay, well, that's gonna be a climbing check

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:02.500
In your barbarian rage, you can't figure out how to climb up

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:06.500
Shit!

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:08.500
What are you trying to do?

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.500
Let us help you

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:12.500
What's your end game?

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:15.500
I got myself so freaking freaking out over here

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.500
I can't climb the goddamn statue

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:20.500
Everybody, get on each other's shoulders in a while

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:23.500
Lift me up and put me on top of the statue

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:29.500
It's hard to listen to what you're saying when you're just running against a wall

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:34.500
So I'm still by the dragon, right? I'm still up there with him and he hasn't seen me?

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:37.500
He's too numb in the dick

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:41.500
Yeah, no, you really were hiding so good

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:42.500
He doesn't see you

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:45.500
Right now he's actually occupied with Keith

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:49.500
Can I toss Christopher a second paralyzer?

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.500
That'll be a bit tricky

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:56.500
Can I throw him a rope and can he tie it?

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:57.500
No

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:58.500
No? All right

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.500
You don't have a...

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:08.500
Can I summon a second scorpion to make Keith feel like there's stakes?

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:09.500
I'm gonna keep one

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:12.500
Can I put on a hat of disguise and become Dan's mother again?

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:15.500
Yeah, you could

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:18.500
And you could summon another scorpion if you wanted

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:23.500
Summon a second scorpion, I'm hoping that capitalism will emerge

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.500
And you send him to attack presumably?

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:26.500
Yes, of course

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:27.500
What's his name?

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.500
David

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:32.500
Keith and David

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.500
Keith and David?

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.500
Yeah, that's right

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:39.500
Because David critically strikes the dragon in the side of the head

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:40.500
That's true

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.500
I am with the... sorry

01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:45.500
Dealing 12 damage

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:49.500
Now that's how you scorpion, Keith

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.500
My Keith should be more like David

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:54.500
Keith looks dejected

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.500
I have a red cap poison

01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.500
Can I stab the dragon with it?

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:02.500
Yeah, so that's one of the poisons in your dagger

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.500
Should I do that?

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.500
Okay, stab him

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:10.500
You see the dragon seems a bit less lucid

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.500
A bit loopy if you will

01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:14.500
You stab him

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:17.500
Your dagger manages to pierce its hide

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.500
But only just a little

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:22.500
It doesn't seem to have any effect

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.500
You might want to...

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.500
You guys won't end it here

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.500
It's going to take a while

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.500
If you want

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.500
How many...

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.500
I'm just saying

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:37.500
Are we allowed to know how many power pellets?

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.500
Energy, what's his energy bar?

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:40.500
Health bar

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.500
Is this dragon half dead?

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.500
Yeah, he's about half dead

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:44.500
Okay

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.500
Half dead cliffhanger!

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.500
Half dead dragon!

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.500
Thank you very much

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.500
Spencer Crits than everybody

01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:58.500
Erin McGathy

01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:00.500
Kumail Nanjiani

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.500
Half dead dragon

01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:10.500
I was kind of a half dead dragon tonight

01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.500
With my congestion and my inability

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.500
To put thoughts together

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.500
Are you going to go drinking afterwards?

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:17.500
I don't know

01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.500
Why stop now?

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:22.500
I feel like alcohol kills germs

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.500
That's what they used to tell us

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.500
When we first started drinking

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.500
When we were 13

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:32.500
If you had to share a glass at a party

01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:35.500
Alcohol kills all germs, bro

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.500
That's what I heard

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.500
I never bothered to look into it

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.500
Sigh

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:47.500
Let's close the show

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:52.500
With the greatest rap

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:53.500
Oh, show

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:54.500
Really?

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.500
You feel like you've got this right now?

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:57.500
No

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.500
Alright, do you have a beat you want to do

01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:03.500
Or should I just throw one at you?

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.500
Just throw it at me

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:08.500
You want sexy and slow or something more upbeat?

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.500
Give me sexy and slow

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.500
What's on your mind before we start?

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:15.500
I don't know

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.500
Failure?

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:19.500
Entropy?

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.500
Did you finish your script yet?

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:22.500
No

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:24.500
How does that make you feel?

01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:25.500
Bad

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.500
When was it due?

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.500
January

01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.500
When do you think you'll turn it in?

01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:36.500
May

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:39.500
For real?

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:40.500
I don't know

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.500
Is it any good?

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:42.500
Is it any good?

01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:43.500
I don't know

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.500
Honestly, what do you think right now?

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.500
I don't know

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:47.500
I can't write

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:48.500
I can't write anymore

01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.500
My brain is dead

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:54.500
I used to have sparks connecting the little things

01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:56.500
I just don't have it anymore

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:57.500
I got it

01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:58.500
Something left

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.500
I angered it with my ego

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:04.500
God left my body

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:07.500
Used to hang out

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.500
Do stuff through me

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.500
Now I'm just an asshole hanging out

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.500
Because you feel there's too much expectation

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.500
You deserve it now

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:16.500
It's easy

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:17.500
You proved that you could do it

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.500
Now it's all the apples are going to fall off

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.500
Too much thought about me

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.500
And what I am

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:24.500
And what I'm supposed to be doing

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.500
Too much thought about me writing

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:27.500
I'm writing

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:28.500
I'm going to write something

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:30.500
Me

01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:31.500
That's not how it's supposed to be

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:32.500
How do you get back to the place

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:34.500
Where the universe moves through you?

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:35.500
You get destroyed

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.500
You don't get handed a bunch of money

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.500
By people

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:42.500
You end up back in the gutter

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:43.500
You hit rock bottom

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:44.500
You become human again

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:46.500
Are you semi-consciously sending yourself

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.500
Back to the gutter by doing this?

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.500
Is this self-annihilation

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:50.500
To kind of achieve that?

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:51.500
Probably

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.500
Mom

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:55.500
Mom

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.500
Go to sleep

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.500
Alright

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.500
Yo

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.500
Yeah

01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:09.500
Yeah

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:10.500
Dig me

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:11.500
Smooth rap

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:12.500
Smooth rap

01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.500
From the heart and soul

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:15.500
Smooth rap

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.500
Not rock and roll

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:18.500
I got a road runner

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:20.500
Going down the street

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.500
I got a coyote chasing me

01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:23.500
Wants my meat

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:24.500
His name is Money

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.500
He wants to eat my ass

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.500
I got the Howard Hespin

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.500
At the head of the class

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:33.500
Some rhymes come easier than others

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.500
Got a retarded sister

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:36.500
Got a dumb ass brother

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:39.500
I got two parents that live in Miami

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.500
They're not in Miami

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:43.500
I had a girlfriend named Tammy

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:46.500
She had a mental breakdown

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.500
After I fucked her

01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:51.500
Start over

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:52.500
Give me a different beat

01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.500
I don't like that beat

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:56.500
It's the beat's fault

01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.500
Alright, here we go, yeah

01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:02.500
Oh, yeah

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.500
To the dead

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.500
That was the annihilation

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:06.500
You just died

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:07.500
So now the universe

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.500
Yeah, move back

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.500
Through you again

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:10.500
Yeah

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:11.500
Yeah

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:14.500
Sunshine raindrops and candy

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:17.500
I fucked your mama like she was named Mandy

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:20.500
I fucked your mama in the school and the gym

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.500
I fucked your mama like a Legend of Nim

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:23.500
She was

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.500
I fucked your mama like a mouse

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.500
I fucked your mama in a two-story house

01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:30.500
I fucked her upstairs, downstairs

01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:31.500
I fucked her in the cellar

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:32.500
I fucked your mama so hard

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:34.500
She turned into a bank teller

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.500
She said, withdrawal, no deposit

01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:38.500
I fucked your mama so hard

01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:39.500
I put her ass in the closet

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.500
She was next to the broom

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:42.500
She was next to the mop

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.500
I fucked your mama so hard

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.500
She started to slip, slop

01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:48.500
On the street, like, pussy was wet

01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:51.500
I fucked your mama on a bet

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:52.500
I lost it

01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.500
I didn't win

01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:57.500
I fucked your mama out, not in

01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:58.500
I fucked your mama

01:39:58.500 --> 01:39:59.500
Wait, give me a chance

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:02.500
I fucked your mama didn't take her to the dance

01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:05.500
I fucked your mama made her feel real bad

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:08.500
I fucked your mama, she's the best I ever had

01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.500
I compensated, tried to make her

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:11.500
Oops, shit, sorry

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:12.500
Okay

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:13.500
Alright, alright

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:16.500
Yeah, okay

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:17.500
Here, here

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:18.500
Yeah

01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:19.500
Alright

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:20.500
This is a long track

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:21.500
You got all the stuff

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.500
No, no, no, different beat, different beat

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:26.500
Alright

01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:27.500
Alright

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.500
I blame Jeff tonight

01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:31.500
I blame you too

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:37.500
Here we go

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:38.500
Yeah, this is the one

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:39.500
I feel this one

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:40.500
You got lots of time

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:41.500
This one's not gonna end

01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.500
Yo

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:44.500
Yo

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:45.500
Yo

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:46.500
Yo

01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:47.500
Yo

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:49.500
Saying nothing but speaking my mind

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.500
I fucked your mama like a rabbit

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:52.500
Came up from behind

01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.500
I put my mouth on her neck

01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:55.500
Mounted her inside

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:58.500
I put my Lupine penis in her womb

01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.500
Where I find my rabbit's firm

01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:01.500
Fertilizer rabbit eggs

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.500
Made little rabbit babies

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:04.500
That had rabbit legs

01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:07.500
And they got eaten in a restaurant

01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:09.500
I fucked your mama so hard

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:13.500
She didn't flaunt her meat

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:14.500
On the menu

01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:16.500
I fucked your mama

01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:20.500
It's not tenuous

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:21.500
Go on, dad

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:22.500
Dad, make it personal

01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.500
Things that don't deflect

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:26.500
Personal wrap sitting in bed

01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:27.500
I got stars on the ceiling

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.500
Dancing over my head

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:32.500
Your mama's uncle comes into my room

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.500
He puts his hand on my thigh

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.500
He says, shh, boom

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:37.500
It's what you should have

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:38.500
But you don't

01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.500
Shouldn't be a boy or a girl

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.500
So I won't do too much

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:45.500
But I'll put my dick in your mouth

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.500
I grew up in the south

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:51.500
And this is all fake confession

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.500
This is a fake Chinatown session

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:54.500
Make it real, make it real

01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:56.500
Trying to force with regression

01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:58.500
Maybe it's time for you to actually

01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.500
Visit the experience of death on stage

01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:02.500
And then you could be born from it

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:05.500
Oh, yeah, that'll be a first

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.500
Silence

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:08.500
In the room

01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.500
Hanging weightless

01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:11.500
Like in a womb

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:14.500
Just gonna wait for the words to come

01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:15.500
I fucked your mama like a finger

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.500
Fucked her like a thumb

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:20.500
Hanging out in outer space

01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:23.500
Only thinking about class and race

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:26.500
Floating through in the atmosphere

01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:27.500
I fucked your mama so hard

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.500
Her eye went in her ears

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:32.500
She looked like Sloth from the Goonies

01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:34.500
I fucked your mama

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:36.500
She was a roomie of mine

01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.500
In college

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:38.500
That was my knowledge

01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.500
To fuck her so hard she'd

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:43.500
Fuck shit

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.500
Hold on

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.500
Hold it

01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:47.500
Lost it

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.500
Fuck your mama in the moment

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:50.500
Alright

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.500
Wait, wait

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.500
Hold it, hold it

01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:55.500
Alright

01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:00.500
Everybody get those hands up

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:01.500
Get them out

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.500
Feel the energy in that

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.500
Look out, look out of the corner

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:08.500
Yeah, there's like eight people

01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.500
This is the best

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.500
I don't have to do anything

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.500
I'm just gonna sit here and watch you do this

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.500
What is this dance?

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:29.500
Feel it

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.500
I have a heart attack

01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.500
This is humanity

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:36.500
Look on it

01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:38.500
Accept it

01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:40.500
This is what you are underneath

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.500
Underneath all your credit cards

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:46.500
And your real estate deals

01:43:46.500 --> 01:44:02.500
This is what you look like

01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:03.500
Alright

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.500
So much more real than I expected

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:08.500
Cosmic journey through the light and dark

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:11.500
Going out to make the truth start

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:14.500
Going past the stars and the planets

01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:16.500
I fucked your mama

01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:28.500
I gotta pick out a way to end the show

01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:32.500
I got nowhere to be

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:34.500
Alright

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:36.500
There's not gonna be any

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:37.500
Space

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:38.500
Time

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.500
Lemon

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.500
South

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:52.500
Mama

01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:54.500
Mouth

01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:55.500
Eye

01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.500

01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:16.500
Gary Busey

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:18.500
Give me a second

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:21.500
It's like the master

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:22.500
Remember the master?

01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.500
Yeah

01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:26.500
Alright

01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:27.500
Hold on

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:28.500
Just let it go

01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:31.500
Do your little dance again

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:37.500
Mystical sorcerer

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:38.500

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:41.500
Fuck your mama

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:42.500
No

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:43.500
Okay

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:44.500
Hold on

01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:45.500
Cauldron was a toughie

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:46.500
Cauldron was tough

01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:47.500
It doesn't have to rhyme

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:48.500
It doesn't have to rhyme, Jeff

01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:49.500
Buzz Aldrin?

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:50.500
He had all kinds

01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:51.500
Come on, Jeff

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:52.500
Alright, sorry

01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:58.500
Alright

01:45:58.500 --> 01:45:59.500
You can take this

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:00.500
So where's Cauldron and Buzz Aldrin?

01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:01.500
Mystical

01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:02.500

In their space suits

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:08.500
Rocket ships

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:10.500
Fuck your mama so hard

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:12.500
Her tooth came through her upper lips

01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.500
Came down her throat

01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:15.500
Sperm went into her stomach

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.500
Formed a big sperm moat

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.500
There was a castle in the middle

01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:20.500
Fit as a fiddle

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:21.500
Put waffles down there

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.500
After they were on the griddle

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:24.500
Said hmmm

01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:26.500
Bitch, I just made you a meal

01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:28.500
Then I fucked you from behind

01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:29.500
How's it feel now

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:30.500
The food's going front

01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:32.500
And the dick's going back

01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:34.500
Come back to me

01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.500
For flapjacks at lunch

01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:38.500
Fuck you, whole much more bunch

01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:39.500
Fuck you

01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.500
Fuck your mama for lunch

01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.500
Fuck your mama so hard

01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.500
I only do it because I want to

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:47.500
Not because it has to

01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.500
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody

01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:56.500
I'd like to thank our guest

01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:18.500
Have the courage to

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:20.500
Try something and fail

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:22.500
That's what we learned tonight

01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:25.500
It's a weekly show

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:26.500
You can come back

01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:27.500
We'll see you in a week

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:28.500
