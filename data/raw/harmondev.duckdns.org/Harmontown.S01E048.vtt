{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:25.500\n8 o'clock already I was just in the middle of a dream\n\n00:25.500 --> 00:31.500\nHarmontown is now in session, let me hear all my harmonians scream\n\n00:31.500 --> 00:38.500\nOh shit! It's Monday nights, we're at the Meltdown Theater in Hollywood, California\n\n00:38.500 --> 00:41.500\nHarmontown is once again in session, you lucky devils\n\n00:41.500 --> 00:46.500\nWon't you please walk into the stage of the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon\n\n00:46.500 --> 01:02.500\nThank you, Jeff. Jeff Davis, your Comptroller. That's an interesting choice, sir\n\n01:02.500 --> 01:06.500\nOpening music, we referenced it inadvertently last week, do you remember?\n\n01:06.500 --> 01:07.500\nI don't.\n\n01:07.500 --> 01:20.500\nOh no, DC Pearson's episode, when he was a guest, I said, God damn it, I don't know, somebody I told them I was lost in their eyes and was kissing them by a crystal blue Italian stream\n\n01:20.500 --> 01:27.500\nI was driving here in my car and I had my whole iPod on shuffle and that came up and I was like, I've never started the show with Manic Monday\n\n01:27.500 --> 01:29.500\nManic Monday, yeah\n\n01:29.500 --> 01:41.500\nThe podcast probably airs around Thursday, but for these people here tonight, it's another hopefully Manic Monday, they need a little mania to keep them awake because tomorrow is Tuesday and they've got shit to do\n\n01:41.500 --> 01:52.500\nBut you're shit out of luck because I just got over a three or four day cold, I don't know if you can hear my David Duchovny, Willie Nelson congestion\n\n01:52.500 --> 02:01.500\nBut yeah, I've been sitting in bed watching Gene Hackman movies for four days by a crystal blue Italian stream\n\n02:01.500 --> 02:12.500\nOnly Gene Hackman? Well, I went on a little Gene Hackman bender, I watched Night Moves, I've never seen Night Moves, it was nice, this is a scene where he's laying face down\n\n02:12.500 --> 02:27.500\nThis could only happen in the 70s, it just cuts to Gene Hackman naked, just finished bone in his ex-wife and he's laying face down and there's a fondue pot in front of him and he's naked and he's got his foot on her tit\n\n02:27.500 --> 02:36.500\nSorry, let me explain, she's sitting against the headboard like sitting up in bed and Gene Hackman is laying face down\n\n02:36.500 --> 02:42.500\nAnd there's a fondue at the foot of the bed, so there's a pot in front of the camera\n\n02:42.500 --> 02:43.500\nThat sounds like a real hazard\n\n02:43.500 --> 02:48.500\nIf this was in 3D, the first thing in front of your face that you would reach out in touch would be a fondue pot\n\n02:48.500 --> 02:54.500\nThe second thing would be Gene Hackman, the third thing would be his foot and the fourth thing right under that would be this woman's tit\n\n02:54.500 --> 02:59.500\nAnd he's just got a big smile on his face and he's solving a murder case\n\n02:59.500 --> 03:09.500\nMy parents had a lot of sexy 70s, early 80s fondue parties, was this hot oil and meat or was this cheese?\n\n03:09.500 --> 03:12.500\nI was dying to know whether it was chocolate or cheese\n\n03:12.500 --> 03:18.500\nThe whole scene, you could tell that it was a situation where the actor just asked for some business\n\n03:18.500 --> 03:21.500\nI have a feeling the fondue pot was requested by the actor\n\n03:21.500 --> 03:29.500\nAnd I have a feeling it was empty and I think he just sat there and played with something on a stick and then played with her tit with his foot\n\n03:29.500 --> 03:33.500\nYou almost destroyed the vodka\n\n03:33.500 --> 03:37.500\nIt's another manic Monday, whatever\n\n03:37.500 --> 03:43.500\nWe got off to a slow start and we're going to have a slow middle and then we're going to end the show very slowly\n\n03:43.500 --> 03:45.500\nMaybe we should start off with a bang then\n\n03:45.500 --> 03:51.500\nBecause I kind of can't, I have that congestion where you can't, I don't even know if anyone can hear me\n\n03:51.500 --> 03:53.500\nYou know what I mean?\n\n03:53.500 --> 03:57.500\nThis sounds, this will make people angry\n\n03:57.500 --> 03:59.500\nImagine what it's like to be deaf\n\n03:59.500 --> 04:01.500\nNo, probably not, I don't think\n\n04:01.500 --> 04:03.500\nBut I mean as close as I can get\n\n04:03.500 --> 04:07.500\nYou're kind of talking out into nothingness\n\n04:07.500 --> 04:11.500\nAnd that's good, they brought the lights up more to compensate for my lack of other senses\n\n04:11.500 --> 04:14.500\nI'm like daredevil\n\n04:14.500 --> 04:16.500\nIt should be the other way around\n\n04:16.500 --> 04:18.500\nYour lack of hearing should heighten your vision right now\n\n04:18.500 --> 04:20.500\nEverything should be the other way around\n\n04:20.500 --> 04:26.500\nJeff, which is a segue into a favorite segment called Things Dan Harmon Has to Complain About\n\n04:26.500 --> 04:29.500\nThat he's afraid to complain about because it'll make him sound like a bad person\n\n04:29.500 --> 04:31.500\nThank you\n\n04:31.500 --> 04:46.500\nI have 5,000 Facebook friends, which makes my calendar very unmanageable\n\n04:46.500 --> 04:48.500\nThere's a lot of settings that I don't understand\n\n04:48.500 --> 04:51.500\nMy Google Calendar and my Facebook are somehow interwoven\n\n04:51.500 --> 04:55.500\nAnd I'm 40 and I'm not going to put the time into figuring it out anymore\n\n04:55.500 --> 04:59.500\nSo I just have this calendar, I just go, do I have anything going on today?\n\n04:59.500 --> 05:01.500\nAnd the answer is always yes, it'll just say\n\n05:01.500 --> 05:05.500\nAh, Chip and Simmons' dating hour, is it UCB?\n\n05:05.500 --> 05:07.500\nWhat?\n\n05:07.500 --> 05:11.500\nOh, it's Maggie Molina's birthday, what?\n\n05:11.500 --> 05:14.500\nI don't, that's my complaint, 5,000\n\n05:20.500 --> 05:23.500\nI'm trying to punctuate this as best I can, man\n\n05:23.500 --> 05:27.500\nI'm trying to show biz up this bit a little bit\n\n05:27.500 --> 05:31.500\nThere's gotta be some checkbook, checkbox, there's gotta be some checkbook\n\n05:31.500 --> 05:33.500\nI can make a check out to Facebook\n\n05:33.500 --> 05:36.500\nThere's gotta be a checkbox somewhere where it says, like, yeah, sure\n\n05:36.500 --> 05:41.500\nEvery time someone has an improv show that is on my Facebook thing\n\n05:41.500 --> 05:43.500\nI don't want that on my Google Calendar\n\n05:43.500 --> 05:47.500\nI just, I feel so fucking old, and I'm not complaining about that\n\n05:47.500 --> 05:52.500\nIt's just amazing, I've said this before, I remember my grandpa before\n\n05:52.500 --> 05:57.500\nAfter he killed the Japanese for our country\n\n05:57.500 --> 06:00.500\nAnd after he drove a truck, and after he blew up in an oil tank\n\n06:00.500 --> 06:03.500\nAnd after he did a million amazing things\n\n06:03.500 --> 06:10.500\nRight before he died of emphysema, he was the treasurer for his Freemason club\n\n06:10.500 --> 06:14.500\nAnd he had a little, little Mac, a little tiny Mac\n\n06:14.500 --> 06:19.500\nAnd he was just, like, using his little skin grafted hand to, like, learn, like, quicken\n\n06:19.500 --> 06:23.500\nAnd he would get so frustrated with the goddamn fucking computer\n\n06:23.500 --> 06:27.500\nGoddammit, Danny, can you tell me how the goddamn spreadsheet works?\n\n06:27.500 --> 06:31.500\nAnd I would go, I actually, I don't, I'm not sure, well, go up to think\n\n06:31.500 --> 06:34.500\nBut I remember thinking to my head, like, ah, grandpa, come on, don't try to use a computer\n\n06:34.500 --> 06:40.500\nAnd I'm not, I'm not that much, like, it's, it's, it's, you can, technology's moving faster now\n\n06:40.500 --> 06:44.500\nSo I'm pretty much, I think I'm exactly where my grandpa was right before he died\n\n06:44.500 --> 06:48.500\nIn terms of, like, understanding goddamn computers\n\n06:48.500 --> 06:50.500\nIt's not exciting to talk about\n\n06:50.500 --> 06:51.500\nWas that one of them?\n\n06:51.500 --> 06:54.500\nNo, no, that's something I'm allowed to, not allowed to complain about\n\n06:54.500 --> 06:56.500\nBecause it'll make people think I'm boring\n\n06:56.500 --> 06:57.500\nSorry\n\n06:58.500 --> 07:00.500\nAlright, there's only one more item in this segment\n\n07:00.500 --> 07:06.500\nUh, uh, the, uh, professional puppy, uh, uh, that, that I'm, uh, breeding\n\n07:06.500 --> 07:07.500\nThrough a professional puppy breeder\n\n07:07.500 --> 07:09.500\nYou're breeding a professional puppy?\n\n07:09.500 --> 07:10.500\nYeah\n\n07:10.500 --> 07:14.500\nIt's, it's gonna pull down 20k a year\n\n07:14.500 --> 07:16.500\nUh, just licking its balls\n\n07:16.500 --> 07:19.500\nWhat, what, oh yeah, so you say, what line of work is this puppy gonna go into?\n\n07:19.500 --> 07:20.500\nHanging out\n\n07:20.500 --> 07:23.500\nUh, now it's, uh, we went, we went through a breeder\n\n07:23.500 --> 07:25.500\nThis is why I'm not allowed to complain about it\n\n07:25.500 --> 07:26.500\nBecause you're supposed to rescue your pets\n\n07:26.500 --> 07:27.500\nAnd I don't want to talk about it\n\n07:27.500 --> 07:29.500\nBut, uh, it's for my cat\n\n07:29.500 --> 07:32.500\nMy aides having cat, that, that, that is a rescue cat\n\n07:32.500 --> 07:37.500\nJust because your cat has aides doesn't make you buying a purebred dog, you know\n\n07:37.500 --> 07:38.500\nAny cooler\n\n07:38.500 --> 07:40.500\nNo, it doesn't make it cooler, but it makes it permissible\n\n07:40.500 --> 07:45.500\nBecause I can't bring a three-legged, one-eyed, fucked-up Ukrainian dog into the house\n\n07:45.500 --> 07:48.500\nWith, with my aides cat hanging out\n\n07:48.500 --> 07:52.500\nWhose, whose immune system, which is linked to stress and territory\n\n07:52.500 --> 07:53.500\nCats are territorial\n\n07:53.500 --> 07:56.500\nShe's, she's, she, I don't know how much longer she has to live\n\n07:56.500 --> 07:59.500\nI know it's her house, it's her rules, I love her\n\n07:59.500 --> 08:02.500\nShe was there first, she's a rescue cat\n\n08:02.500 --> 08:04.500\nI'm not gonna bring some maniac into the house\n\n08:04.500 --> 08:05.500\nDogs are all maniacs\n\n08:05.500 --> 08:09.500\nWell, not little pity puppies that come in a little pity puppy box\n\n08:09.500 --> 08:10.500\nThat, that\n\n08:10.500 --> 08:11.500\nIf she\n\n08:11.500 --> 08:12.500\nPuppies don't come in a box, damn\n\n08:12.500 --> 08:17.500\nIf she's there when the box is open, if she comes swatted on the head and assert dominance\n\n08:17.500 --> 08:20.500\nIt's the safest route to go, okay\n\n08:20.500 --> 08:23.500\nAnd I'm not gonna go to a weird, one of those weird Korea town puppy stores\n\n08:23.500 --> 08:25.500\nWhere the puppies are in the fish tank or whatever\n\n08:28.500 --> 08:34.500\nI went through a respectable breeder who's breeding a healthy, a healthy hybrid\n\n08:34.500 --> 08:36.500\nWhen is, when is a dog gonna come in?\n\n08:36.500 --> 08:37.500\nWhen does the box arrive?\n\n08:37.500 --> 08:40.500\nA couple, a couple months now, there's the different stages\n\n08:40.500 --> 08:44.500\nThey were just born, the mother just gave birth to 13 puppies\n\n08:44.500 --> 08:45.500\n13 puppy litter\n\n08:46.500 --> 08:47.500\nThat's bad luck, you know\n\n08:49.500 --> 08:51.500\nBad luck for the 13th puppy, yeah\n\n08:52.500 --> 08:53.500\nCause there's only 12 nipples\n\n08:55.500 --> 08:56.500\nLook it up\n\n08:58.500 --> 08:59.500\nIt's probably like six\n\n09:03.500 --> 09:07.500\nBut, but, but the dog nipples are dichotomous\n\n09:07.500 --> 09:09.500\nThey have two openings on them\n\n09:09.500 --> 09:11.500\nSo for a maximum of 12 dogs\n\n09:11.500 --> 09:12.500\nThat's also not true\n\n09:18.500 --> 09:20.500\nI'm assuming they would tell us in the email\n\n09:20.500 --> 09:26.500\nThey send us ultrasounds, like we could see little dog skeletons in the larger dog skeleton\n\n09:27.500 --> 09:29.500\nAnd then they, I'm assuming they would tell us\n\n09:29.500 --> 09:33.500\nA lot of times, especially with a larger litter, there's some tragedies\n\n09:33.500 --> 09:35.500\nYou know, with cats and dogs\n\n09:35.500 --> 09:36.500\nThere's a stillborn\n\n09:36.500 --> 09:38.500\nYeah, I'm assuming they would tell us\n\n09:38.500 --> 09:42.500\nSo 13 newborn puppies without a single tragedy is really, that's a lucky dog\n\n09:42.500 --> 09:44.500\nWhat sort of dog are you getting?\n\n09:44.500 --> 09:47.500\nIt's a half golden retriever, half poodle\n\n09:47.500 --> 09:49.500\nAnd what do you call it?\n\n09:49.500 --> 09:52.500\nA retriever maximus\n\n09:54.500 --> 09:55.500\nGolden doodle\n\n09:59.500 --> 10:01.500\nYou don't have to call it that\n\n10:03.500 --> 10:05.500\nHave you got a name for it?\n\n10:05.500 --> 10:08.500\nNo, no, we're gonna let that happen organically\n\n10:09.500 --> 10:11.500\nAs organic as ordering a dog, huh?\n\n10:14.500 --> 10:17.500\nAre you getting lots of shit from people for not rescuing a dog?\n\n10:17.500 --> 10:19.500\nNo, no, just a couple people initially\n\n10:19.500 --> 10:22.500\nBut now I've learned to walk around with a giant asterisk\n\n10:22.500 --> 10:24.500\nAnd cut everyone off at the pass\n\n10:24.500 --> 10:27.500\nAnd be a big, you know, bore people with\n\n10:27.500 --> 10:29.500\nBefore you say anything\n\n10:30.500 --> 10:32.500\nMy cat has AIDS\n\n10:32.500 --> 10:35.500\nYeah, exactly\n\n10:35.500 --> 10:37.500\nBy the way, my cat, I don't know if...\n\n10:37.500 --> 10:40.500\nMy cat has no name, my cat's name is Fivian, F-I-V\n\n10:40.500 --> 10:42.500\nBecause when we rescued my cat\n\n10:42.500 --> 10:45.500\nWe were told, the vet said, it has F-I-V\n\n10:45.500 --> 10:47.500\nWhat's that? It's like HIV, but for cats\n\n10:47.500 --> 10:50.500\nOh, shit, we rescued a cat that's like\n\n10:50.500 --> 10:54.500\nWe're gonna just spend the last act of a Julia Roberts movie with this thing\n\n10:54.500 --> 10:56.500\nLet's not name it\n\n10:56.500 --> 10:58.500\nLike, let's let it, let's just love it\n\n10:58.500 --> 11:00.500\nAnd let it live its wildlife\n\n11:00.500 --> 11:02.500\nYou know, and we'll feed it\n\n11:02.500 --> 11:04.500\nAnd we'll let it kind of shuffle off to Buffalo\n\n11:04.500 --> 11:08.500\nAnd Buffalo is where I believe you go when you die\n\n11:10.500 --> 11:12.500\nSo where you get your wings\n\n11:12.500 --> 11:14.500\nAnd so it's like 13 years later or something\n\n11:14.500 --> 11:17.500\nAnd the cat's name is Fiv, F-I-V\n\n11:19.500 --> 11:22.500\nIt happens, it never happens with human beings, but it happens\n\n11:22.500 --> 11:25.500\nSpeaking of death, let's keep the theme of death going\n\n11:25.500 --> 11:28.500\nI want to bring up a special friend\n\n11:28.500 --> 11:30.500\nWho comes here very often, who's very interesting\n\n11:30.500 --> 11:33.500\nAnd we should have often talked to him\n\n11:33.500 --> 11:37.500\nAnd I just, shit, we got a lot of people that fit that category\n\n11:37.500 --> 11:40.500\nI just realized I perked up like six people\n\n11:40.500 --> 11:43.500\nI want to bring up Brian W. Collins\n\n11:43.500 --> 11:45.500\nIs he here? Brian, are you here? No\n\n11:45.500 --> 11:46.500\nOkay, that's good actually\n\n11:46.500 --> 11:50.500\nOkay, you know why?

Who else?\n\n14:47.500 --> 14:48.500\nAlan Arkin\n\n14:48.500 --> 14:52.500\nLike, yeah, god damn it, well there was somebody who was in a Raymond Chandler like thing\n\n14:52.500 --> 14:55.500\nWas it Elliot Gould? Yeah, I think it was Elliot Gould, it was like The Long Goodnight or something\n\n14:55.500 --> 14:56.500\nYeah, yeah\n\n14:56.500 --> 14:57.500\nGod damn it, long goodbye\n\n14:57.500 --> 14:59.500\nIt was The Long Something\n\n14:59.500 --> 15:05.500\nAnd there was, god, it was like guys like your dad, there was like guys with beards and checkered shirts\n\n15:05.500 --> 15:07.500\nAnd I longed for those days\n\n15:07.500 --> 15:11.500\nLike to, well you're bringing it back\n\n15:11.500 --> 15:18.500\nLike to go back to the, make a brief stop in the 80s and be a rap sensation by rhyming me with free\n\n15:18.500 --> 15:22.500\nAnd saying ha ha ha ha ha for the rest of the lyrics\n\n15:22.500 --> 15:26.500\nBut then straight back to the 70s where I would be a sex symbol\n\n15:26.500 --> 15:30.500\nJust for a little bit, like a horror movie, I'd be like that lumberjack that came by\n\n15:30.500 --> 15:32.500\nI was like, what's going on, what's the problem?\n\n15:32.500 --> 15:37.500\nThe mercury poisoning is making bears bigger, I'll check it out\n\n15:37.500 --> 15:40.500\nBut first I'm gonna fuck her and her\n\n15:40.500 --> 15:43.500\nThen I'm gonna wrestle that bear\n\n15:43.500 --> 15:46.500\nSo I watched one horror movie a day, is that what I did?\n\n15:46.500 --> 15:47.500\nYeah, yeah, you did\n\n15:47.500 --> 15:48.500\nAnd then I wrote a blog about it\n\n15:48.500 --> 15:52.500\nYour name's Brian W. Collins, I think your blog is probably called horrormovieaday.com\n\n15:52.500 --> 15:54.500\nI'm gonna assume, does anyone know that that's true?\n\n15:54.500 --> 15:55.500\nYeah\n\n15:55.500 --> 15:57.500\nThat's Brian Collins' lawyer\n\n15:57.500 --> 16:01.500\nAnd does he love all of them? Or is he critical of them?\n\n16:01.500 --> 16:08.500\nI think it's safe to say he's a huge fan of the genre in general to the point where he's willing to tolerate warts and all\n\n16:08.500 --> 16:10.500\nThat he recognizes good ones and bad ones\n\n16:10.500 --> 16:11.500\nThere's a lot of warts in that genre\n\n16:11.500 --> 16:15.500\nDoug, what is your movie schedule? Like how do you intake that many movies?\n\n16:15.500 --> 16:17.500\nAre you always in the theaters?\n\n16:17.500 --> 16:21.500\nNo, I just have them implanted in my brain\n\n16:21.500 --> 16:23.500\nYeah, right now I'm watching Brave\n\n16:23.500 --> 16:28.500\nOh, I cried finally getting around to that\n\n16:28.500 --> 16:31.500\nWhen the bear eats the salmon, fuck it, it got me\n\n16:31.500 --> 16:34.500\nIt was a goodie\n\n16:34.500 --> 16:36.500\nThere's a scene in a restaurant? No\n\n16:36.500 --> 16:39.500\nThe bear orders sushi\n\n16:39.500 --> 16:43.500\nThe mom and brave turns into a bear and then she has to learn how to eat salmon\n\n16:43.500 --> 16:45.500\nBut she's not a bear, she's a woman, she's a queen\n\n16:45.500 --> 16:48.500\nAnd then the daughter has to teach her how to fish\n\n16:48.500 --> 16:50.500\nI cried, I'm an idiot\n\n16:50.500 --> 16:54.500\nThat movie was not sold as a movie about bears\n\n16:54.500 --> 16:59.500\nIt was supposed to be about a young girl who's good at archery\n\n16:59.500 --> 17:02.500\nI liked it though because it was only about women\n\n17:02.500 --> 17:06.500\nThere was no damsel in distress, no knight in shining armor bullshit\n\n17:06.500 --> 17:09.500\nIt was really just about female characters\n\n17:09.500 --> 17:11.500\nA guy didn't come in and save the day for once\n\n17:11.500 --> 17:13.500\nI kind of liked that\n\n17:13.500 --> 17:18.500\nAnd she didn't shave off all of her hair like Felicity\n\n17:18.500 --> 17:20.500\nShe kept that beautiful mane\n\n17:20.500 --> 17:27.500\nDid Felicity do that to make a point that I'm bigger than my hair?\n\n17:27.500 --> 17:31.500\nYeah, I think the idea was it was such a big move for Felicity to shave it off\n\n17:31.500 --> 17:34.500\nAnd then the ratings dropped\n\n17:34.500 --> 17:37.500\nYou think about her, you think about her hair, it's true\n\n17:37.500 --> 17:39.500\nThat hair was important\n\n17:39.500 --> 17:41.500\nBut she doesn't have that hair on the Americans\n\n17:41.500 --> 17:43.500\nHave you seen the Americans?\n\n17:43.500 --> 17:44.500\nNo, no\n\n17:44.500 --> 17:48.500\nShe has a sex show where she's like a Soviet spy pretending to be American\n\n17:48.500 --> 17:50.500\nAnd she has short hair?\n\n17:50.500 --> 17:53.500\nNot short hair, but she doesn't have the curls\n\n17:53.500 --> 17:55.500\nShe has Russian hair\n\n17:55.500 --> 17:57.500\nAnd her name's not Felicity, right?\n\n17:57.500 --> 17:58.500\nNo\n\n17:58.500 --> 18:00.500\nShe eliminated everything, she got the whack-a-mole game right\n\n18:00.500 --> 18:02.500\nShe knows that she's a good person\n\n18:02.500 --> 18:04.500\nShe did it\n\n18:04.500 --> 18:06.500\nWhack-a-mole?\n\n18:06.500 --> 18:08.500\nYeah, like...\n\n18:08.500 --> 18:12.500\nI'm assuming that she eliminates her hair\n\n18:12.500 --> 18:14.500\nShe's like, God damn it, it's just my hair\n\n18:14.500 --> 18:17.500\nShe's in the shopping aisle and she sees Us Magazine\n\n18:17.500 --> 18:20.500\nAnd it says, like, best hair ever, Felicity\n\n18:20.500 --> 18:22.500\nAnd she's like, fuck this, I'm cutting off my hair\n\n18:22.500 --> 18:25.500\nAnd then she cuts it off, and they're like\n\n18:25.500 --> 18:28.500\nHey, good job acting\n\n18:28.500 --> 18:29.500\nWhere'd your hair go?\n\n18:29.500 --> 18:33.500\nAnd then she gets a different job, but maybe the character's name is Felicity\n\n18:33.500 --> 18:36.500\nI was thinking maybe it was hard for her to nail down all the variables\n\n18:36.500 --> 18:39.500\nThat she's in a quest to figure out that she's a good person\n\n18:39.500 --> 18:41.500\nI guess I can't back that up\n\n18:41.500 --> 18:43.500\nAlright\n\n18:43.500 --> 18:44.500\nI like it\n\n18:44.500 --> 18:46.500\nAnd back to Wreck-it Ralph\n\n18:46.500 --> 18:47.500\nYeah\n\n18:47.500 --> 18:48.500\nGood movie\n\n18:48.500 --> 18:49.500\nYou enjoyed it?\n\n18:49.500 --> 18:50.500\nI did\n\n18:50.500 --> 18:53.500\nI found it not only touching in that kind of cloying way\n\n18:53.500 --> 18:56.500\nThat most of those movies, you can kind of count on being touched now\n\n18:56.500 --> 18:59.500\nLike, it's sort of like being Catholic\n\n18:59.500 --> 19:05.500\nHello, next in the way that you use it\n\n19:05.500 --> 19:07.500\nYou can kind of...\n\n19:07.500 --> 19:09.500\nI mean, to the point where it can actually make you well up\n\n19:09.500 --> 19:11.500\nAnd you're kind of like, now we take that for granted\n\n19:11.500 --> 19:13.500\nI'm like, I'm going to Pixar to hear her coming down\n\n19:13.500 --> 19:16.500\nIt's just, you know, that guy is like such good animation\n\n19:16.500 --> 19:18.500\nI can tell how alone he is\n\n19:18.500 --> 19:21.500\nBut it's like, it's another thing to have that\n\n19:21.500 --> 19:24.500\nAnd then also, like, it's kind of profound\n\n19:24.500 --> 19:27.500\nLike, I thought, like, there's, I don't know\n\n19:27.500 --> 19:30.500\nThere's a social subversiveness to it\n\n19:30.500 --> 19:32.500\nAll that filtered through, it's a movie for kids\n\n19:32.500 --> 19:34.500\nBut I was watching it going like\n\n19:34.500 --> 19:38.500\nI can't really nail them down on any bad messaging for anybody in particular\n\n19:38.500 --> 19:41.500\nThey really had to thread a needle because there's a, you know\n\n19:41.500 --> 19:44.500\nThere's a character in the movie that's like congenitally afflicted\n\n19:44.500 --> 19:46.500\nAnd it's like, oh, you're special, you're not special\n\n19:46.500 --> 19:49.500\nAnd I was like, how are they going to land this?\n\n19:49.500 --> 19:53.500\nAre they going to, is the moral going to be that she needs to not be afflicted?\n\n19:53.500 --> 19:56.500\nOr is the moral going to be that her affliction is a gift?\n\n19:56.500 --> 19:58.500\nBecause it's hard to get through those highway cones these days\n\n19:58.500 --> 20:00.500\nAnd I thought they got through them as well as you possibly could\n\n20:00.500 --> 20:02.500\nWhat was the moral, eventually? I forgot\n\n20:02.500 --> 20:06.500\nIt was like, there's evil people in the world that made you afflicted\n\n20:06.500 --> 20:09.500\nBut your affliction is a matter of perception\n\n20:09.500 --> 20:13.500\nSo as soon as you just participate with your affliction\n\n20:13.500 --> 20:15.500\nYou stop being afflicted\n\n20:15.500 --> 20:16.500\nSo it's really just a matter of\n\n20:16.500 --> 20:18.500\nSo it's kind of like Thalidomide babies\n\n20:18.500 --> 20:22.500\nYeah, just, if you're a Thalidomide baby, host a talk show\n\n20:22.500 --> 20:24.500\nThat's the message, like get out there\n\n20:25.500 --> 20:27.500\nGet out there on a dancing show or something\n\n20:27.500 --> 20:28.500\nYeah, just do it, yeah\n\n20:28.500 --> 20:30.500\nJust get out there, get in their face\n\n20:30.500 --> 20:32.500\nDancing with the Thalidomide stars\n\n20:32.500 --> 20:35.500\nYeah, and then people\n\n20:35.500 --> 20:39.500\nI love the groans, like is Thalidomide babies even a thing anymore?\n\n20:39.500 --> 20:40.500\nTo be upset about?\n\n20:40.500 --> 20:43.500\nIt's like people being upset for Dracula\n\n20:47.500 --> 20:49.500\nCaptain's hat is confused\n\n20:49.500 --> 20:51.500\nThat's your friend Adam Goldberg\n\n20:51.500 --> 20:52.500\nHi Adam\n\n20:52.500 --> 20:54.500\nAdam Goldberg has affected a skipper hat\n\n20:56.500 --> 20:58.500\nWe'll see you on the Lido deck after the show\n\n20:58.500 --> 21:03.500\nAdam Goldberg has retired from being a Harmontown character by his own account\n\n21:03.500 --> 21:07.500\nHe's now going to sit in the audience and slowly become Captain Crunch\n\n21:07.500 --> 21:11.500\nLike he's going to put more epaulets and metals on\n\n21:11.500 --> 21:13.500\nHe's going to have a parrot in his shoulder going\n\n21:13.500 --> 21:15.500\nNot in the show, rot, rot!\n\n21:16.500 --> 21:19.500\nAnd he's going to tear up the roof of our mouths\n\n21:21.500 --> 21:23.500\nAs Captain Crunch is known to do\n\n21:23.500 --> 21:25.500\nYou're supposed to put milk in there Doug\n\n21:25.500 --> 21:27.500\nYou're supposed to put milk in there\n\n21:27.500 --> 21:29.500\nYou're supposed to put milk in there\n\n21:29.500 --> 21:32.500\nYou've got to get them so soggy before they'll tear up your mouth\n\n21:32.500 --> 21:35.500\nSomething in there that's slow, I think it's just like peeling, it's like chemical peel\n\n21:35.500 --> 21:36.500\nMilk or not\n\n21:36.500 --> 21:40.500\nYeah, that's why I'll have the Crunch Berries because they're a goddamn relief\n\n21:41.500 --> 21:43.500\nNext to the Crunch itself\n\n21:43.500 --> 21:47.500\nThey had a cereal cup, for a brief period they had ET cereal\n\n21:47.500 --> 21:49.500\nAnd it was because there were Reese's Pieces in the movie\n\n21:49.500 --> 21:53.500\nThat was peanut butter chocolate cereal in the shapes of little E's and T's\n\n21:53.500 --> 21:57.500\nBecause I assumed that they couldn't make them the shape of a bike or something\n\n21:57.500 --> 21:59.500\nAnd it was so fucking good\n\n21:59.500 --> 22:01.500\nAnd then it was like gone off the shelves immediately\n\n22:01.500 --> 22:03.500\nAnd I know it wasn't because they weren't delicious\n\n22:03.500 --> 22:04.500\nAnd I know it wasn't because they weren't selling\n\n22:04.500 --> 22:06.500\nSo it must be because they gave me cancer\n\n22:07.500 --> 22:11.500\nI'm waiting to find out that ET cereal gave me cancer\n\n22:11.500 --> 22:13.500\nOris Spielberg came down on it for some reason\n\n22:13.500 --> 22:15.500\nWould you think they tried to do it on the slide?\n\n22:17.500 --> 22:18.500\nNice try\n\n22:18.500 --> 22:22.500\nET and it says, extra tasty\n\n22:25.500 --> 22:27.500\nVitamin E and thiamine\n\n22:28.500 --> 22:31.500\nPhone a bowl of delicious\n\n22:33.500 --> 22:37.500\nAnd it's just like, they got a kid on the box that's like a burn victim\n\n22:37.500 --> 22:39.500\nThat's like, yeah\n\n22:40.500 --> 22:42.500\nYeah, you're right, burn victims are funny\n\n22:42.500 --> 22:43.500\nSo what am I, baby?\n\n22:43.500 --> 22:45.500\nNo, burn victim, yes\n\n22:45.500 --> 22:48.500\nWe're going to find, we're going to find, we're whack-a-mole in the audience\n\n22:48.500 --> 22:51.500\nAnd it says whack-a-mole, whack-a-mole, what the fuck?\n\n22:51.500 --> 22:52.500\nI'm calling you out\n\n22:52.500 --> 22:53.500\nWhat does that mean?\n\n22:53.500 --> 22:54.500\nSorry, sorry, sorry\n\n22:54.500 --> 22:56.500\nHave you tried Lincoln O's? Those are pretty good\n\n22:56.500 --> 22:58.500\nLincoln, Lincoln O's\n\n22:58.500 --> 22:59.500\nLincoln O's?\n\n22:59.500 --> 23:00.500\nYeah, it's a new cereal\n\n23:00.500 --> 23:01.500\nYeah\n\n23:01.500 --> 23:03.500\nYeah, it tastes like freedom\n\n23:03.500 --> 23:04.500\nFreedom\n\n23:04.500 --> 23:06.500\nAnd raspberry\n\n23:07.500 --> 23:10.500\nWait, is this a real thing or is this a hustler cartoon?\n\n23:10.500 --> 23:15.500\nIs it a real thing?\n\n23:16.500 --> 23:18.500\nLincoln O's\n\n23:20.500 --> 23:21.500\nWell, yeah\n\n23:21.500 --> 23:24.500\nLincoln Logs, I guess would be a good breakfast drink\n\n23:24.500 --> 23:26.500\nYou guys remember Hogan's Heroes, right?\n\n23:26.500 --> 23:28.500\nThis world has insane things in it\n\n23:28.500 --> 23:30.500\nIt does, it does have the craziest things\n\n23:30.500 --> 23:32.500\nIt's sitcom about a concentration camp\n\n23:32.500 --> 23:34.500\nThat's the best\n\n23:35.500 --> 23:38.500\nAlright, well, that was based off of the Billy Wilder film, right?\n\n23:38.500 --> 23:40.500\nStalard 17, it was it?\n\n23:40.500 --> 23:41.500\nWhat was?\n\n23:41.500 --> 23:42.500\nHogan's Heroes\n\n23:42.500 --> 23:44.500\nWasn't it kind of based on the success of that film?\n\n23:44.500 --> 23:46.500\nYeah, it's like, let's take the funny parts of that movie\n\n23:46.500 --> 23:49.500\nabout the guys in a concentration camp\n\n23:49.500 --> 23:50.500\nRight\n\n23:50.500 --> 23:52.500\nAnd then make it a weekly series\n\n23:52.500 --> 23:53.500\nExactly\n\n23:53.500 --> 23:54.500\nWhere the Germans are done\n\n23:54.500 --> 23:56.500\nI remember like, you know, I was pretty young\n\n23:56.500 --> 23:57.500\nwhen I first started watching MASH\n\n23:57.500 --> 23:59.500\nI was like, MASH, that's a...\n\n23:59.500 --> 24:01.500\nThe Korean War was really ugly\n\n24:01.500 --> 24:03.500\nand it's a hospital, that must have been a good pitch\n\n24:03.500 --> 24:04.500\nIt's such a weird thing\n\n24:04.500 --> 24:06.500\nAnd then you watch the MASH movie\n\n24:06.500 --> 24:08.500\nand it's like a Robert Altman film\n\n24:08.500 --> 24:10.500\nand it's like this weird meandering thing\n\n24:10.500 --> 24:12.500\nabout the Korean War\n\n24:12.500 --> 24:14.500\nDoesn't it end pretty much with a football game?\n\n24:14.500 --> 24:15.500\nYeah\n\n24:15.500 --> 24:17.500\nIt ends the way a lot of ski movies end\n\n24:17.500 --> 24:19.500\nin the 80s\n\n24:19.500 --> 24:21.500\nBut you assume, because it's Robert Altman\n\n24:21.500 --> 24:23.500\nand the Korean War, that that means something\n\n24:23.500 --> 24:25.500\nand you go like, fuck it, I'll vote for someone else then\n\n24:25.500 --> 24:26.500\nWhat happened to ski movies?\n\n24:26.500 --> 24:28.500\nSki movies were a thing for a while\n\n24:28.500 --> 24:29.500\nWe accomplished it\n\n24:29.500 --> 24:30.500\nAdam Goldbrick\n\n24:30.500 --> 24:33.500\nI was about to make a scheme to be last week, so...\n\n24:33.500 --> 24:34.500\nShut up\n\n24:34.500 --> 24:35.500\nPerfect\n\n24:35.500 --> 24:37.500\nYou were about to make one, but you had the wrong hat on\n\n24:39.500 --> 24:42.500\nYou were like, I'll get a ski hat and we'll talk\n\n24:43.500 --> 24:44.500\nYou were about to make a ski movie?\n\n24:44.500 --> 24:45.500\nYeah, for sci-fi\n\n24:45.500 --> 24:46.500\nFor real?\n\n24:46.500 --> 24:47.500\nYeah, I told you about it, I was really...\n\n24:47.500 --> 24:49.500\nI wasn't listening\n\n24:51.500 --> 24:54.500\nDo the listeners love it when he talks a lot off mic like that?\n\n24:54.500 --> 24:55.500\nWell, not off mic\n\n24:55.500 --> 24:57.500\nSome of them like it when he talks on mic\n\n24:57.500 --> 24:59.500\nSome of them don't, it's like a whole thing\n\n24:59.500 --> 25:00.500\nBut can they hear him when he was just saying it?\n\n25:00.500 --> 25:01.500\nNo, they can't hear him really\n\n25:01.500 --> 25:03.500\nAnd you don't bother to repeat it?\n\n25:03.500 --> 25:04.500\nSometimes they do\n\n25:04.500 --> 25:06.500\nI mean, you're an old pro, I can sense\n\n25:06.500 --> 25:08.500\nHe's like, eh, don't worry about it\n\n25:08.500 --> 25:10.500\nSometimes the mics pick it up, I don't know\n\n25:10.500 --> 25:12.500\nI kind of like, I let God decide\n\n25:14.500 --> 25:15.500\nYou were God\n\n25:15.500 --> 25:17.500\nI am God, I let me decide\n\n25:18.500 --> 25:20.500\nSo it depends on how much I've been drinking\n\n25:20.500 --> 25:23.500\nDoug, I'm sorry, I'm not audio running my show\n\n25:25.500 --> 25:26.500\nLike a steel trap\n\n25:26.500 --> 25:28.500\nHey, it was just a question\n\n25:28.500 --> 25:30.500\nI know you have a lot of moles to whack\n\n25:30.500 --> 25:35.500\nHe's a mixed bag, if you open this box, here, watch\n\n25:35.500 --> 25:38.500\nIs that what his profile says on Twitter, mixed bag?\n\n25:39.500 --> 25:40.500\nOh, here we go\n\n25:41.500 --> 25:45.500\nA microphone is dangerously being extended towards Adam right now\n\n25:45.500 --> 25:47.500\nOh, he's pulling it out of the stand\n\n25:47.500 --> 25:48.500\nBecause he likes to hold on to it\n\n25:48.500 --> 25:49.500\nBecause he's a pro\n\n25:49.500 --> 25:50.500\nYep\n\n25:51.500 --> 25:53.500\nOh, now what's supposed to happen?\n\n25:53.500 --> 25:56.500\nNow the host of this show has no microphone\n\n25:56.500 --> 25:58.500\nNo microphone\n\n25:59.500 --> 26:00.500\nIt's the danger zone\n\n26:00.500 --> 26:05.500\nNo, last week I was hired on to production-manage a ski movie\n\n26:05.500 --> 26:07.500\nCalled Avalanche Sharks\n\n26:10.500 --> 26:12.500\nSweared hand to the Lord\n\n26:12.500 --> 26:14.500\nAnd it was renamed Avalanche Shark\n\n26:14.500 --> 26:15.500\nThen Avalanche Sharks\n\n26:15.500 --> 26:18.500\nBecause they couldn't determine how many puppet sharks\n\n26:18.500 --> 26:20.500\nShould be furnished for the script\n\n26:20.500 --> 26:23.500\nThis was a huge source of contention\n\n26:23.500 --> 26:26.500\nSo they're still making ski movies, but they keep\n\n26:26.500 --> 26:29.500\nKilling all the actors with the puppets\n\n26:29.500 --> 26:31.500\nSo this is a movie about people skiing\n\n26:31.500 --> 26:32.500\nAnd then there's an Avalanche\n\n26:32.500 --> 26:34.500\nBut inside the Avalanche there are sharks\n\n26:34.500 --> 26:36.500\nOr the Avalanche was caused by sharks\n\n26:36.500 --> 26:38.500\nI couldn't get through all the way through the script\n\n26:38.500 --> 26:40.500\nI was supposed to be working on\n\n26:42.500 --> 26:44.500\nYeah, that's about it\n\n26:44.500 --> 26:47.500\nNow he's gonna get the microphone back\n\n26:47.500 --> 26:49.500\nMicrophone is going back in the stand\n\n26:49.500 --> 26:50.500\nGood call, Dan\n\n26:50.500 --> 26:51.500\nThere you go\n\n26:51.500 --> 26:53.500\nAdam Goldberg, everyone\n\n26:53.500 --> 26:54.500\nThank you, Adam\n\n26:54.500 --> 26:56.500\nWorth a try\n\n26:56.500 --> 26:57.500\nWorth a try\n\n26:57.500 --> 26:58.500\nThat does bring up an interesting point\n\n26:58.500 --> 26:59.500\nAs a fan of movies\n\n26:59.500 --> 27:01.500\nAnd probably a fan of crappy movies\n\n27:01.500 --> 27:02.500\nAnd talking about them\n\n27:02.500 --> 27:05.500\nWhat's your take on the sci-fi original movement\n\n27:05.500 --> 27:09.500\nOf like, Mansquito and Gator Bader\n\n27:10.500 --> 27:12.500\nYou know, human dental floss\n\n27:12.500 --> 27:15.500\nAnd things that you're like 10, 15 years ago\n\n27:15.500 --> 27:17.500\nIf you saw these titles you'd go, holy shit\n\n27:17.500 --> 27:22.500\nYou know, you seem like you might be around my age\n\n27:22.500 --> 27:24.500\nLike the greatest thing used to be to get high\n\n27:24.500 --> 27:26.500\nAnd go to the actual video store\n\n27:26.500 --> 27:27.500\nAnd walk up and down aisles\n\n27:27.500 --> 27:30.500\nAnd look at pictures and read backs of boxes\n\n27:30.500 --> 27:34.500\nAnd go to sci-fi kickboxing sections\n\n27:34.500 --> 27:35.500\nAnd go like, holy shit\n\n27:35.500 --> 27:37.500\nThese people are trying as hard as they can\n\n27:37.500 --> 27:38.500\nTo make a good movie\n\n27:38.500 --> 27:39.500\nThis is their citizen Kane\n\n27:39.500 --> 27:41.500\nLet's watch the result\n\n27:41.500 --> 27:45.500\nAnd now in this post-Piranha 3D post-Mansquito world\n\n27:45.500 --> 27:47.500\nIt's like, no, it's supposed to be funny\n\n27:47.500 --> 27:50.500\nOpto-Hirana Teradana\n\n27:50.500 --> 27:52.500\nPiranha Shark Gator\n\n27:52.500 --> 27:54.500\nIt's hilarious, Debbie Gibson's in it\n\n27:54.500 --> 27:55.500\nIt's funny\n\n27:55.500 --> 27:58.500\nAnd I'm kind of like, fuck you if you think it's funny\n\n27:58.500 --> 28:00.500\nFuck you, try hard so I can laugh at you\n\n28:00.500 --> 28:04.500\nWithout video stores, where do we go now?\n\n28:04.500 --> 28:05.500\nI don't have one\n\n28:05.500 --> 28:07.500\nBut where do you go to argue with your girlfriend?\n\n28:09.500 --> 28:10.500\nTo really find out\n\n28:10.500 --> 28:12.500\nWhere do you go to have a horrible relationship?\n\n28:12.500 --> 28:16.500\nYeah, it's like, you really want me to walk down this aisle?\n\n28:16.500 --> 28:19.500\nYeah, the Tom Hanks Meg Ryan aisle\n\n28:19.500 --> 28:20.500\nBefore the actual aisle\n\n28:20.500 --> 28:24.500\nDan, can we hear your pitch on him in dental floss?\n\n28:24.500 --> 28:27.500\nIt's a guy who works for the American Medical Association\n\n28:27.500 --> 28:30.500\nAnd he stops by the American Dental Association\n\n28:30.500 --> 28:33.500\nTo tell them that they should be working together\n\n28:33.500 --> 28:36.500\nBecause dentists aren't paying attention to medicine\n\n28:36.500 --> 28:37.500\nThey're focused on the teeth\n\n28:37.500 --> 28:39.500\nAnd he's a doctor\n\n28:39.500 --> 28:41.500\nAnd so he's like, what are you guys doing here?\n\n28:41.500 --> 28:43.500\nAnd they're like, pretty soon the whole world's going to be teeth, right?\n\n28:43.500 --> 28:45.500\nAnd then he...\n\n28:45.500 --> 28:49.500\nAnd we've got a virtual chamber to show you that\n\n28:49.500 --> 28:50.500\nAnd it's like a tooth chamber\n\n28:50.500 --> 28:51.500\nAnd he gets locked in it\n\n28:51.500 --> 28:54.500\nAnd then they maximize the calcium rays\n\n28:54.500 --> 28:56.500\nAnd he ends up between the teeth\n\n28:56.500 --> 28:58.500\nBut because of his medical knowledge\n\n28:58.500 --> 29:00.500\nHe's able to keep himself alive\n\n29:00.500 --> 29:02.500\nAs his body is compressed by the teeth\n\n29:02.500 --> 29:04.500\nSo he becomes effectively human dental floss\n\n29:04.500 --> 29:06.500\nBy page 20\n\n29:06.500 --> 29:08.500\nAnd then he goes out in the streets\n\n29:08.500 --> 29:09.500\nAnd he finds that he's able\n\n29:09.500 --> 29:11.500\nThere's a lot of heavy-handed metaphors about cleaning\n\n29:11.500 --> 29:14.500\nThe streets, you know\n\n29:14.500 --> 29:16.500\nThis place is needed, you know\n\n29:16.500 --> 29:19.500\nA lot of...it's got gum disease\n\n29:19.500 --> 29:21.500\nWhat...its gunners are bleeding\n\n29:21.500 --> 29:23.500\nIt's a sign that it needs to brush harder\n\n29:23.500 --> 29:25.500\nIt's dumb, it's a dumb movie\n\n29:25.500 --> 29:29.500\nIt has Richard Marx's in it\n\n29:29.500 --> 29:31.500\nIt's very...it's purposely campy\n\n29:31.500 --> 29:32.500\nIt's stupid\n\n29:32.500 --> 29:33.500\nIt's one of those, yeah\n\n29:33.500 --> 29:37.500\nYeah, it's a fucking...it's a one million dollar sci-fi original\n\n29:37.500 --> 29:39.500\nAnd it's like, oh, I'm supposed to show up\n\n29:39.500 --> 29:41.500\nTo watch you fuck around?\n\n29:41.500 --> 29:42.500\nI wanted to fuck around with my friends\n\n29:42.500 --> 29:44.500\nAnd some cheesy popcorn\n\n29:44.500 --> 29:46.500\nYeah, I'm not a fan...\n\n29:46.500 --> 29:47.500\nI'm not into that they're making movies\n\n29:47.500 --> 29:49.500\nThat are shit intentionally\n\n29:49.500 --> 29:50.500\nThey're just shoving things together\n\n29:50.500 --> 29:53.500\nAnd calling it a movie\n\n29:53.500 --> 29:55.500\nI don't...I don't seek that out\n\n29:55.500 --> 29:56.500\nThere's plenty of movies that try to be great\n\n29:56.500 --> 29:57.500\nAnd are awful\n\n29:57.500 --> 29:59.500\nYeah, and that's what's funny\n\n29:59.500 --> 30:00.500\nThat I like to watch\n\n30:00.500 --> 30:01.500\nThat's why we have the Olympics\n\n30:01.500 --> 30:03.500\nAnd we don't have like shitty Olympics\n\n30:03.500 --> 30:05.500\nIt's called Special Olympics\n\n30:05.500 --> 30:08.500\nBut close enough\n\n30:08.500 --> 30:10.500\nBut those people try even harder\n\n30:10.500 --> 30:14.500\nThey still brought to you by...it's a little mild\n\n30:14.500 --> 30:18.500\nSpecial Olympians try as hard as real Olympians\n\n30:18.500 --> 30:20.500\nThey're just special when they're trying\n\n30:20.500 --> 30:21.500\nAgain, that's the whole point\n\n30:21.500 --> 30:22.500\nThey probably try harder\n\n30:22.500 --> 30:23.500\nAnd then don't murder their girlfriend\n\n30:23.500 --> 30:25.500\nThrough a bathroom door\n\n30:25.500 --> 30:28.500\nThat's a reference I will pretend to get\n\n30:28.500 --> 30:30.500\nBecause I'm sure it's going to be a shame\n\n30:30.500 --> 30:31.500\nThat I don't get the right...\n\n30:31.500 --> 30:32.500\nBut that combines...there was a guy\n\n30:32.500 --> 30:36.500\nOscar Petraeus?\n\n30:36.500 --> 30:38.500\nOh, he doesn't sound evil\n\n30:38.500 --> 30:41.500\nYou really don't know the story of Oscar Petraeus?\n\n30:41.500 --> 30:43.500\nDr. Petraeus?\n\n30:43.500 --> 30:45.500\nFrom beyond?\n\n30:45.500 --> 30:46.500\nPretend this is not real\n\n30:46.500 --> 30:48.500\nPretend that this is an idea I'm pitching to you\n\n30:48.500 --> 30:49.500\nTo make a movie\n\n30:49.500 --> 30:50.500\nOkay, I work at Sci-Fi\n\n30:50.500 --> 30:53.500\nThere is a guy that ran in the regular Olympics\n\n30:53.500 --> 30:54.500\nThe last Olympics\n\n30:54.500 --> 30:57.500\nAnd he has...he's missing both legs below the knee\n\n30:57.500 --> 30:58.500\nWhat?\n\n30:58.500 --> 30:59.500\nAnd they call him the Blade Runner\n\n30:59.500 --> 31:00.500\nThe Blade Runner?\n\n31:00.500 --> 31:01.500\nBecause he has two behind his back?\n\n31:01.500 --> 31:02.500\nNo\n\n31:02.500 --> 31:03.500\nTo his face\n\n31:03.500 --> 31:04.500\nTo his face\n\n31:04.500 --> 31:06.500\nThey're like, you're a replicant\n\n31:06.500 --> 31:09.500\nHe has two...two metal...\n\n31:09.500 --> 31:10.500\nTwo metal, like, kind of hooky things\n\n31:10.500 --> 31:11.500\nThat he runs on\n\n31:11.500 --> 31:12.500\nAnd people are like, and he runs like...\n\n31:12.500 --> 31:13.500\nThey look like springs\n\n31:13.500 --> 31:14.500\nI thought it was cheating\n\n31:14.500 --> 31:15.500\nYeah\n\n31:15.500 --> 31:17.500\nDo they know Blade Runners aren't replicants?\n\n31:17.500 --> 31:19.500\nOr might be depending on which cut of the movie\n\n31:19.500 --> 31:22.500\nI don't think...\n\n31:22.500 --> 31:23.500\nI want to know how much...\n\n31:23.500 --> 31:24.500\nAre they calling him a robot\n\n31:24.500 --> 31:25.500\nOr are they calling him like...\n\n31:25.500 --> 31:26.500\nBecause they're like blades\n\n31:26.500 --> 31:28.500\nHe's a runner and there's two metal things\n\n31:28.500 --> 31:29.500\nOn his legs\n\n31:29.500 --> 31:30.500\nThey're like blades\n\n31:30.500 --> 31:31.500\nThey're like springy, weird blades\n\n31:31.500 --> 31:33.500\nAnd he was a big hero in the Olympics\n\n31:33.500 --> 31:34.500\nIt was a big thing\n\n31:34.500 --> 31:37.500\nAnd now he recently is under a murder investigation\n\n31:37.500 --> 31:39.500\nFor shooting his girlfriend to pieces\n\n31:39.500 --> 31:40.500\nIn the bathroom\n\n31:40.500 --> 31:41.500\nJesus\n\n31:41.500 --> 31:42.500\nShot her through the bathroom door\n\n31:42.500 --> 31:45.500\nHis story is that he heard noise in the bathroom\n\n31:45.500 --> 31:46.500\nThought it was a burglar\n\n31:46.500 --> 31:47.500\nBecause a lot of burglars...\n\n31:47.500 --> 31:49.500\nWhat the first thing they'll do is take a dump\n\n31:49.500 --> 31:51.500\nAnd...\n\n31:51.500 --> 31:54.500\nAnd he didn't bother to look to see if his girlfriend\n\n31:54.500 --> 31:55.500\nWas in bed with him\n\n31:55.500 --> 31:56.500\nThat's the guy\n\n31:56.500 --> 31:58.500\nSomeone just handed Dan a phone with a picture on it\n\n31:58.500 --> 32:00.500\nAnd he...\n\n32:00.500 --> 32:01.500\nSo he shot through the bathroom door\n\n32:01.500 --> 32:02.500\nBecause he thought it was a burglar\n\n32:02.500 --> 32:03.500\nDo you know what...\n\n32:03.500 --> 32:05.500\nOkay, am I racist?\n\n32:05.500 --> 32:07.500\nBecause I assumed he was black\n\n32:07.500 --> 32:08.500\nBecause...\n\n32:08.500 --> 32:09.500\nYes\n\n32:09.500 --> 32:12.500\nYes, you are\n\n32:12.500 --> 32:13.500\nBecause what?\n\n32:13.500 --> 32:15.500\nBut not because of the murder\n\n32:15.500 --> 32:16.500\nBecause of the...\n\n32:16.500 --> 32:18.500\nBecause of the Olympian prowess\n\n32:18.500 --> 32:20.500\nBecause of the...\n\n32:20.500 --> 32:21.500\nI picture it\n\n32:21.500 --> 32:23.500\nEven like those black dudes\n\n32:23.500 --> 32:24.500\nI know it's still racist\n\n32:24.500 --> 32:26.500\nBetter athletes than you\n\n32:26.500 --> 32:28.500\nBut I was like...\n\n32:28.500 --> 32:30.500\nIt was reasonable racism\n\n32:30.500 --> 32:31.500\nI was like...\n\n32:31.500 --> 32:33.500\nYou said he was like an amazing runner\n\n32:33.500 --> 32:34.500\nAnd he's from South Africa\n\n32:34.500 --> 32:35.500\nBut that's a Dutch colony\n\n32:35.500 --> 32:37.500\nSo, you know, it was a toss-up\n\n32:37.500 --> 32:38.500\nI didn't hear South Africa\n\n32:38.500 --> 32:39.500\nThat's not...\n\n32:39.500 --> 32:40.500\nI immediately was just like...\n\n32:40.500 --> 32:42.500\nI just pictured a fucking amazing runner\n\n32:42.500 --> 32:43.500\nWith robot legs\n\n32:43.500 --> 32:45.500\nAnd I pictured an awesome black guy\n\n32:45.500 --> 32:47.500\nTell me because it has to in some way\n\n32:47.500 --> 32:48.500\nSome minute way\n\n32:48.500 --> 32:49.500\nOr maybe some grand way\n\n32:49.500 --> 32:52.500\nAffects your new perception of this guy\n\n32:52.500 --> 32:54.500\nI hate him more\n\n32:54.500 --> 32:55.500\nBecause I was raised in the 70s\n\n32:55.500 --> 32:57.500\nI thought if he was black\n\n32:57.500 --> 32:58.500\nI was like, well, maybe\n\n32:58.500 --> 33:02.500\nWhat did this woman do to him?\n\n33:02.500 --> 33:04.500\nTurns out she was just beautiful\n\n33:04.500 --> 33:08.500\nAnd trying to take a shit\n\n33:08.500 --> 33:10.500\nHey, I know you got lots more things going on tonight\n\n33:10.500 --> 33:11.500\nI'm going to take off\n\n33:11.500 --> 33:13.500\nBut thank you so much for having me\n\n33:13.500 --> 33:15.500\nThank you, Doug Benson\n\n33:22.500 --> 33:23.500\nDoug Benson\n\n33:23.500 --> 33:25.500\nHe read the writing on the wall\n\n33:25.500 --> 33:26.500\nWhen he got out on stage\n\n33:26.500 --> 33:28.500\nHe's like, if I'm going to get out of here\n\n33:28.500 --> 33:29.500\nIn an orderly fashion\n\n33:29.500 --> 33:30.500\nIt's going to be because of professional\n\n33:30.500 --> 33:32.500\nSchedules this thing\n\n33:32.500 --> 33:33.500\nThat was very pro\n\n33:33.500 --> 33:35.500\nHe's got to laugh and just bone out\n\n33:37.500 --> 33:38.500\nAll right\n\n33:38.500 --> 33:39.500\nTo his point\n\n33:39.500 --> 33:40.500\nWait, should we talk about the Blade Runner?\n\n33:40.500 --> 33:42.500\nNo, everyone's talking about him\n\n33:42.500 --> 33:44.500\nAlso, I'm kind of proud of the fact that\n\n33:44.500 --> 33:48.500\nBecause of my pop-cultural deafness\n\n33:48.500 --> 33:51.500\nI'm not plugged in at all anymore\n\n33:51.500 --> 33:55.500\nWe never talked about that fucking\n\n33:55.500 --> 33:57.500\nCrazy super villain\n\n33:57.500 --> 33:59.500\nThat cop that went nuts\n\n33:59.500 --> 34:01.500\nAnd was shooting other cops\n\n34:01.500 --> 34:02.500\nAnd then they burnt him to death\n\n34:02.500 --> 34:04.500\nIn a cabin and blah, blah, blah\n\n34:04.500 --> 34:05.500\nI just wanted to bring up the fact\n\n34:05.500 --> 34:06.500\nThat we never talked about it\n\n34:06.500 --> 34:07.500\nAlso, I feel like\n\n34:07.500 --> 34:09.500\nI got a lot of media coverage for it\n\n34:09.500 --> 34:10.500\nBut then it was just kind of gone\n\n34:10.500 --> 34:11.500\nIt seemed like\n\n34:11.500 --> 34:13.500\nI think it was so much malfeasance\n\n34:13.500 --> 34:15.500\nAnd shit that went down\n\n34:15.500 --> 34:18.500\nLAPDs shoot up a bunch of innocent fuckers\n\n34:18.500 --> 34:20.500\nA bad cop got chased\n\n34:20.500 --> 34:21.500\nBy other bad cops\n\n34:21.500 --> 34:24.500\nAnd everybody else died\n\n34:24.500 --> 34:25.500\nYeah, that was like\n\n34:25.500 --> 34:26.500\nYeah, that was just a rug\n\n34:26.500 --> 34:27.500\nGetting like boom, boom\n\n34:27.500 --> 34:29.500\nLike out in the middle of the room\n\n34:29.500 --> 34:30.500\nAnd yeah\n\n34:30.500 --> 34:31.500\nI don't think I've told it in harm intended\n\n34:31.500 --> 34:33.500\nI won't make it a long story if possible\n\n34:33.500 --> 34:34.500\nLike I was walking\n\n34:34.500 --> 34:35.500\nI went to USC\n\n34:35.500 --> 34:36.500\nAnd I was walking down the road\n\n34:36.500 --> 34:37.500\nWith my friend Matt Gorley\n\n34:37.500 --> 34:39.500\nJust super ego podcast and stuff\n\n34:39.500 --> 34:41.500\nAnd we're walking up the road\n\n34:41.500 --> 34:43.500\nAnd we've been playing like with pellet guns\n\n34:43.500 --> 34:44.500\nWe actually had guns on us\n\n34:44.500 --> 34:46.500\nEarly like little replica Berettas\n\n34:46.500 --> 34:47.500\nWe're just like little like\n\n34:47.500 --> 34:48.500\nShot little plastic balls\n\n34:48.500 --> 34:49.500\nLike before Airsoft\n\n34:49.500 --> 34:50.500\nWe're walking up Figueroa Boulevard\n\n34:50.500 --> 34:52.500\nDowntown South Central\n\n34:52.500 --> 34:54.500\nAnd with another friend of ours Kenny\n\n34:54.500 --> 34:55.500\nAnd a car goes by us\n\n34:55.500 --> 34:56.500\nAnd backfires\n\n34:56.500 --> 34:58.500\nAnd that doesn't really happen anymore\n\n34:58.500 --> 34:59.500\nLike you don't hear the old time\n\n34:59.500 --> 35:00.500\nHe's like bang\n\n35:00.500 --> 35:01.500\nLike the old like you know\n\n35:01.500 --> 35:02.500\nAdmissions bro\n\n35:02.500 --> 35:04.500\nYou gotta get that shit checked out\n\n35:04.500 --> 35:05.500\nAbsolutely\n\n35:05.500 --> 35:07.500\nWell, you don't see a lot of dog shit\n\n35:07.500 --> 35:08.500\nOur friend Kenny heard\n\n35:08.500 --> 35:09.500\nThis old truck go by\n\n35:09.500 --> 35:10.500\nAnd went bam\n\n35:10.500 --> 35:12.500\nAnd he just jokingly fell down\n\n35:12.500 --> 35:13.500\nLike he had been shot\n\n35:13.500 --> 35:15.500\nAnd then LAPD cop car\n\n35:15.500 --> 35:17.500\nCame U-turn\n\n35:17.500 --> 35:19.500\nAnd came up on the curb\n\n35:19.500 --> 35:21.500\nGoing the wrong way on the street\n\n35:21.500 --> 35:22.500\nAnd two guys emerged from it\n\n35:22.500 --> 35:24.500\nTwo officers with guns\n\n35:24.500 --> 35:25.500\nOut of their holsters\n\n35:25.500 --> 35:26.500\nNot pointed at us\n\n35:26.500 --> 35:28.500\nBut guns out of their holsters\n\n35:28.500 --> 35:29.500\nScreaming to me\n\n35:29.500 --> 35:30.500\nOh, Kenny falls down\n\n35:30.500 --> 35:32.500\nMatt keeps walking\n\n35:32.500 --> 35:33.500\nAnd I'm kind of like\n\n35:33.500 --> 35:35.500\nLike to stand there\n\n35:35.500 --> 35:36.500\nLike you know\n\n35:36.500 --> 35:37.500\nLike not taunting him\n\n35:37.500 --> 35:38.500\nBut like I got a funny bit\n\n35:38.500 --> 35:39.500\nLike get back up\n\n35:39.500 --> 35:40.500\nOr whatever\n\n35:40.500 --> 35:43.500\nAnd the cops screaming at me\n\n35:43.500 --> 35:44.500\nGetting in the wall\n\n35:44.500 --> 35:45.500\nGetting in the wall\n\n35:45.500 --> 35:47.500\nAnd like freaking out\n\n35:47.500 --> 35:48.500\nNot like\n\n35:48.500

35:54.500\nAnd now at this point\n\n35:54.500 --> 35:55.500\nKenny's getting up\n\n35:55.500 --> 35:56.500\nAnd he's fine\n\n35:56.500 --> 35:57.500\nI'm like\n\n35:57.500 --> 35:58.500\nJesus Christ\n\n35:58.500 --> 35:59.500\nWhat the fuck is going on\n\n35:59.500 --> 36:00.500\nWhat the fuck is going on\n\n36:00.500 --> 36:01.500\nYou\n\n36:01.500 --> 36:02.500\nI'm like\n\n36:02.500 --> 36:03.500\nWhat's going on\n\n36:03.500 --> 36:04.500\nAnd Kenny's like\n\n36:04.500 --> 36:06.500\nA car backfired bro\n\n36:06.500 --> 36:07.500\nAnd I'm like\n\n36:07.500 --> 36:08.500\nAnd one of the cops\n\n36:08.500 --> 36:09.500\nOh my\n\n36:09.500 --> 36:10.500\nOh Jesus\n\n36:10.500 --> 36:12.500\nOh Jesus Christ\n\n36:12.500 --> 36:13.500\nJesus Christ\n\n36:13.500 --> 36:15.500\nWho thought you killed them\n\n36:15.500 --> 36:16.500\nI was like\n\n36:16.500 --> 36:18.500\nPut your guns away\n\n36:18.500 --> 36:20.500\nThat story's called\n\n36:20.500 --> 36:21.500\nCops are human\n\n36:21.500 --> 36:22.500\nI mean they didn't\n\n36:22.500 --> 36:23.500\nYeah but how about\n\n36:23.500 --> 36:24.500\nThey didn't know who to shoot\n\n36:24.500 --> 36:25.500\nHere's a story called\n\n36:25.500 --> 36:26.500\nCops are human\n\n36:26.500 --> 36:27.500\nDon't give them guns\n\n36:27.500 --> 36:28.500\nWell\n\n36:28.500 --> 36:29.500\nNo more fucking guns\n\n36:29.500 --> 36:30.500\nBut at least\n\n36:30.500 --> 36:31.500\nI don't know\n\n36:31.500 --> 36:32.500\nThat sounds like\n\n36:32.500 --> 36:34.500\nThat's the best cops story I've ever heard\n\n36:34.500 --> 36:35.500\nI almost got shot to pieces\n\n36:35.500 --> 36:36.500\nBecause these guys\n\n36:36.500 --> 36:37.500\nYou didn't almost get shot to pieces\n\n36:37.500 --> 36:38.500\nThey took their guns out\n\n36:38.500 --> 36:39.500\nBecause they thought\n\n36:39.500 --> 36:40.500\nThat someone got shot\n\n36:40.500 --> 36:41.500\nAnd they didn't know who\n\n36:41.500 --> 36:42.500\nBut they weren't being cool about it\n\n36:42.500 --> 36:43.500\nWell they\n\n36:44.500 --> 36:45.500\nThank God because\n\n36:45.500 --> 36:46.500\nThank God they're not cyborgs\n\n36:46.500 --> 36:47.500\nOr like\n\n36:47.500 --> 36:48.500\nI don't know\n\n36:48.500 --> 36:49.500\nNo fuckers get shot\n\n36:49.500 --> 36:50.500\nBecause they accidentally\n\n36:50.500 --> 36:51.500\nThe bad version of the story\n\n36:51.500 --> 36:52.500\nWould have been like\n\n36:52.500 --> 36:53.500\nIf they pointed a gun\n\n36:53.500 --> 36:54.500\nAt someone's face\n\n36:54.500 --> 36:55.500\nAnd were like\n\n36:55.500 --> 36:56.500\nYou know what I mean\n\n36:56.500 --> 36:57.500\nLike I don't know\n\n36:57.500 --> 36:58.500\nThey panicked\n\n36:58.500 --> 36:59.500\nBecause they thought\n\n36:59.500 --> 37:00.500\nSomeone actually\n\n37:00.500 --> 37:01.500\nWas needed to help\n\n37:01.500 --> 37:02.500\nA crazy post traumatic stress disorder\n\n37:02.500 --> 37:03.500\nCop\n\n37:03.500 --> 37:04.500\nThreatened to kill everybody\n\n37:04.500 --> 37:05.500\nIn the LAPD\n\n37:05.500 --> 37:06.500\nAnd their response\n\n37:06.500 --> 37:07.500\nWas to go and start\n\n37:07.500 --> 37:08.500\nShooting Mexican ladies\n\n37:08.500 --> 37:09.500\nStuff like that\n\n37:09.500 --> 37:10.500\nYeah well\n\n37:10.500 --> 37:11.500\nI mean God knows\n\n37:11.500 --> 37:12.500\nI mean the LAPD\n\n37:12.500 --> 37:13.500\nIs the only police force\n\n37:13.500 --> 37:14.500\nIn the\n\n37:14.500 --> 37:15.500\nIn the country\n\n37:15.500 --> 37:17.500\nStrangely I know this\n\n37:17.500 --> 37:18.500\nOnly because I wrote\n\n37:18.500 --> 37:20.500\nA sitcom script for\n\n37:20.500 --> 37:21.500\nA\n\n37:21.500 --> 37:22.500\nCalled cop house\n\n37:28.500 --> 37:30.500\nSo I researched\n\n37:30.500 --> 37:31.500\nI forgot that was the name\n\n37:31.500 --> 37:32.500\nResearch the\n\n37:33.500 --> 37:34.500\nIt was based on\n\n37:34.500 --> 37:35.500\nAn internal idea\n\n37:35.500 --> 37:36.500\nAbout a bunch of\n\n37:36.500 --> 37:37.500\nThe house is a cop\n\n37:37.500 --> 37:41.500\nYeah\n\n37:41.500 --> 37:42.500\nIt's kind of like\n\n37:42.500 --> 37:43.500\nMonster house\n\n37:45.500 --> 37:46.500\nHere comes the neighborhood\n\n37:46.500 --> 37:47.500\nA house\n\n37:53.500 --> 37:54.500\nA house is so\n\n37:54.500 --> 37:55.500\nTired of being robbed\n\n37:56.500 --> 37:57.500\nAnd broken into\n\n37:57.500 --> 37:58.500\nIt's set in the future\n\n37:58.500 --> 37:59.500\nAll houses are monsters\n\n37:59.500 --> 38:00.500\nBut some of them\n\n38:00.500 --> 38:01.500\nAre trying to\n\n38:01.500 --> 38:02.500\nMake things right\n\n38:02.500 --> 38:03.500\nRight\n\n38:03.500 --> 38:04.500\nThere are over\n\n38:04.500 --> 38:05.500\n18 million\n\n38:05.500 --> 38:07.500\n9-1-1 calls about\n\n38:07.500 --> 38:08.500\nMonster houses\n\n38:09.500 --> 38:11.500\nOne house has had too much\n\n38:12.500 --> 38:13.500\nI was researching\n\n38:13.500 --> 38:14.500\nThe LAPD\n\n38:14.500 --> 38:15.500\nAnd it was like\n\n38:15.500 --> 38:16.500\nIn the wake of the\n\n38:16.500 --> 38:17.500\nRodney King business\n\n38:17.500 --> 38:18.500\nAnd then there was\n\n38:18.500 --> 38:19.500\nThis other\n\n38:19.500 --> 38:20.500\nWas it on the tail of that\n\n38:20.500 --> 38:21.500\nOr right before that\n\n38:21.500 --> 38:22.500\nBut it was like\n\n38:22.500 --> 38:23.500\nThe rampart scandal\n\n38:23.500 --> 38:24.500\nWhere there was\n\n38:24.500 --> 38:25.500\nAn anti-gang\n\n38:25.500 --> 38:26.500\nTask force\n\n38:26.500 --> 38:27.500\nIn the LAPD\n\n38:27.500 --> 38:28.500\nIt was like\n\n38:28.500 --> 38:29.500\nLook we have a huge\n\n38:29.500 --> 38:30.500\nGang problem\n\n38:30.500 --> 38:31.500\nLet's just\n\n38:31.500 --> 38:32.500\nLet's devote\n\n38:32.500 --> 38:33.500\nA force of police\n\n38:33.500 --> 38:34.500\nLike a little squad\n\n38:34.500 --> 38:35.500\nJust anti-gang\n\n38:35.500 --> 38:36.500\nIn a\n\n38:36.500 --> 38:37.500\nRampart district\n\n38:37.500 --> 38:38.500\nLike\n\n38:38.500 --> 38:39.500\nThat's all you care about\n\n38:39.500 --> 38:40.500\nIt's just\n\n38:40.500 --> 38:41.500\nLike gang activity\n\n38:41.500 --> 38:42.500\nJust get it down\n\n38:42.500 --> 38:43.500\nWhich is just like\n\n38:43.500 --> 38:44.500\nSaying to Robocop\n\n38:44.500 --> 38:45.500\nJust like go get them boy\n\n38:45.500 --> 38:46.500\nAnd they\n\n38:46.500 --> 38:47.500\nOf course\n\n38:47.500 --> 38:48.500\nLike they would\n\n38:48.500 --> 38:49.500\nProbably make an\n\n38:49.500 --> 38:50.500\nAmazing movie\n\n38:50.500 --> 38:51.500\nI'm sure they probably\n\n38:51.500 --> 38:52.500\nMade three bad movies about it\n\n38:52.500 --> 38:53.500\nIn one sense or another\n\n38:53.500 --> 38:54.500\nThat have like\n\n38:54.500 --> 38:55.500\nJake Gyllenhaal\n\n38:55.500 --> 38:56.500\nOr Shia LaBeouf in it\n\n38:56.500 --> 38:57.500\nOr something like that\n\n38:57.500 --> 38:58.500\nI think colors right\n\n38:58.500 --> 38:59.500\nBut they\n\n38:59.500 --> 39:00.500\nEssentially they became\n\n39:00.500 --> 39:01.500\nAnother gang\n\n39:01.500 --> 39:02.500\nBecause they were\n\n39:02.500 --> 39:03.500\nThey had to\n\n39:03.500 --> 39:04.500\nYou know\n\n39:04.500 --> 39:05.500\nThey just got mired in it\n\n39:05.500 --> 39:06.500\nAnd they\n\n39:06.500 --> 39:07.500\nBut the bad thing about that\n\n39:07.500 --> 39:08.500\nIs that they're a gang\n\n39:08.500 --> 39:09.500\nThat you can't call the cops on\n\n39:09.500 --> 39:10.500\nAt all\n\n39:10.500 --> 39:11.500\nSo like they're a gang\n\n39:11.500 --> 39:12.500\nThat has\n\n39:12.500 --> 39:13.500\nSo there was horrible things\n\n39:13.500 --> 39:14.500\nHappening\n\n39:14.500 --> 39:15.500\nLong story short\n\n39:15.500 --> 39:16.500\nIf there was a cop here\n\n39:16.500 --> 39:17.500\nIn the audience\n\n39:17.500 --> 39:18.500\nOr somebody that worked\n\n39:18.500 --> 39:19.500\nIn law enforcement\n\n39:19.500 --> 39:20.500\nI'd love to\n\n39:20.500 --> 39:21.500\nI'm sure it's easy to like\n\n39:21.500 --> 39:22.500\nPinata\n\n39:22.500 --> 39:23.500\nAre the most low\n\n39:23.500 --> 39:24.500\nWe have an admiral\n\n39:24.500 --> 39:25.500\nOver here\n\n39:25.500 --> 39:28.500\nBut the LAPD\n\n39:28.500 --> 39:30.500\nIs the only police force\n\n39:30.500 --> 39:31.500\nIn the United States history\n\n39:31.500 --> 39:32.500\nTo my knowledge\n\n39:32.500 --> 39:33.500\nThat has ever been like\n\n39:33.500 --> 39:34.500\nIt had to have the\n\n39:34.500 --> 39:35.500\nDepartment of Justice\n\n39:35.500 --> 39:36.500\nLike take it over\n\n39:36.500 --> 39:38.500\nAnd like oversee it\n\n39:38.500 --> 39:40.500\nLike every other city\n\n39:40.500 --> 39:41.500\nThat you can name it\n\n39:41.500 --> 39:42.500\nAs a police force\n\n39:42.500 --> 39:43.500\nThey have their ups\n\n39:43.500 --> 39:44.500\nAnd they have their downs\n\n39:44.500 --> 39:45.500\nAnd they have their scandals\n\n39:45.500 --> 39:46.500\nAnd stuff\n\n39:46.500 --> 39:47.500\nBut the LAPD\n\n39:47.500 --> 39:48.500\nJust had so much shit going on\n\n39:48.500 --> 39:49.500\nIn a row\n\n39:49.500 --> 39:50.500\nThat at one point\n\n39:50.500 --> 39:51.500\nThe federal government\n\n39:51.500 --> 39:53.500\nStarted running the LAPD\n\n39:53.500 --> 39:54.500\nWhich is so close to\n\n39:54.500 --> 39:56.500\nOmni-consumer products\n\n39:56.500 --> 39:57.500\nComing in\n\n39:57.500 --> 39:59.500\nIt's really fascinating\n\n39:59.500 --> 40:00.500\nLike the 90s in LA\n\n40:00.500 --> 40:01.500\nAnd the police force\n\n40:01.500 --> 40:02.500\nWho cares?\n\n40:02.500 --> 40:03.500\nIt's fascinating\n\n40:03.500 --> 40:04.500\nSo Google it\n\n40:04.500 --> 40:05.500\nOn the other hand\n\n40:05.500 --> 40:06.500\nIf you want to be entertained\n\n40:06.500 --> 40:07.500\nListen to me\n\n40:07.500 --> 40:08.500\nSorry\n\n40:08.500 --> 40:11.500\nLet's keep the show rolling\n\n40:11.500 --> 40:13.500\nAnd bring up more friends\n\n40:13.500 --> 40:17.500\nWho do you got?\n\n40:17.500 --> 40:19.500\nLet's start off with Spencer\n\n40:19.500 --> 40:20.500\nOn stage for one\n\n40:20.500 --> 40:21.500\nHow about that?\n\n40:21.500 --> 40:22.500\nAll right\n\n40:22.500 --> 40:36.500\nSpencer, our Dungeon Master\n\n40:36.500 --> 40:39.500\nI lost a button in the bathroom\n\n40:39.500 --> 40:40.500\nYeah, I know\n\n40:40.500 --> 40:41.500\nYou told me\n\n40:41.500 --> 40:42.500\nYou were so excited\n\n40:42.500 --> 40:43.500\nIt was a show\n\n40:43.500 --> 40:47.500\nWhat's going on at the Apple Store?\n\n40:47.500 --> 40:48.500\nOkay\n\n40:48.500 --> 40:49.500\nSo there's a thing\n\n40:49.500 --> 40:50.500\nCalled PI\n\n40:50.500 --> 40:51.500\nPhysical Inventory\n\n40:51.500 --> 40:53.500\nIt happens twice a year\n\n40:53.500 --> 40:55.500\nAnd usually we get\n\n40:55.500 --> 40:57.500\nLike two months to prepare for it\n\n40:57.500 --> 40:58.500\nAnd they told us\n\n40:58.500 --> 41:00.500\nLike six days ago\n\n41:00.500 --> 41:01.500\nThey're like\n\n41:01.500 --> 41:03.500\nPI's in a matter of weeks\n\n41:03.500 --> 41:04.500\nThey told us under three weeks\n\n41:04.500 --> 41:05.500\nI guess\n\n41:05.500 --> 41:06.500\nAround\n\n41:06.500 --> 41:08.500\nAnd we're also two people\n\n41:08.500 --> 41:09.500\nDown on our team\n\n41:09.500 --> 41:10.500\nSo we're kind of screwed\n\n41:10.500 --> 41:12.500\nBut also it's fine\n\n41:12.500 --> 41:13.500\nIt's like\n\n41:13.500 --> 41:15.500\nIt's like sweeps week\n\n41:15.500 --> 41:16.500\nThis is like crucial times\n\n41:16.500 --> 41:17.500\nYeah\n\n41:17.500 --> 41:18.500\nSee as you guys\n\n41:18.500 --> 41:19.500\nMight know\n\n41:19.500 --> 41:20.500\nI count stuff\n\n41:20.500 --> 41:22.500\nThis is counting to the extreme\n\n41:22.500 --> 41:24.500\nThis is where the till\n\n41:24.500 --> 41:27.500\nHas to match the digital\n\n41:27.500 --> 41:29.500\nSo we have computers that we use\n\n41:29.500 --> 41:30.500\nAnd we have like\n\n41:30.500 --> 41:31.500\niPods that we use\n\n41:31.500 --> 41:32.500\nAnd iPads\n\n41:32.500 --> 41:33.500\nAnd like\n\n41:33.500 --> 41:34.500\nThere's a bunch of them\n\n41:34.500 --> 41:35.500\nBut we gotta\n\n41:35.500 --> 41:36.500\nCount for all of them\n\n41:36.500 --> 41:37.500\nAnd make sure all the iPads\n\n41:37.500 --> 41:38.500\nAre in order\n\n41:38.500 --> 41:39.500\nAnd they get lost\n\n41:39.500 --> 41:40.500\nIt's crazy\n\n41:40.500 --> 41:41.500\nYou wouldn't think\n\n41:41.500 --> 41:42.500\nYou'd lose stuff like that\n\n41:42.500 --> 41:43.500\nBut it happens\n\n41:43.500 --> 41:44.500\nAnd people hide them\n\n41:44.500 --> 41:45.500\nAnd stuff\n\n41:45.500 --> 41:46.500\nYeah\n\n41:46.500 --> 41:47.500\nYou wouldn't think\n\n41:47.500 --> 41:48.500\nWorking in a giant warehouse\n\n41:48.500 --> 41:49.500\nFull of really expensive\n\n41:49.500 --> 41:50.500\nIn the back\n\n41:50.500 --> 41:51.500\nLike the floor is really\n\n41:51.500 --> 41:52.500\nWide and expansive\n\n41:52.500 --> 41:53.500\nBut in the back\n\n41:53.500 --> 41:54.500\nThere's like\n\n41:54.500 --> 41:55.500\nNothing\n\n41:55.500 --> 41:56.500\nDo Apple employees\n\n41:56.500 --> 41:57.500\nIs it possible in that\n\n41:57.500 --> 41:58.500\nBecause those stores are so slick\n\n41:58.500 --> 41:59.500\nAnd they're so\n\n41:59.500 --> 42:00.500\nIt's such a well-oiled machine\n\n42:00.500 --> 42:01.500\nIs it possible\n\n42:01.500 --> 42:02.500\nTo like steal stuff\n\n42:02.500 --> 42:03.500\nIn the back\n\n42:03.500 --> 42:04.500\nLike in employees\n\n42:04.500 --> 42:05.500\nBecause I worked at Trader Joe's\n\n42:05.500 --> 42:06.500\nAnd I robbed that\n\n42:06.500 --> 42:07.500\nFucker blind\n\n42:07.500 --> 42:10.500\nBut those were potato chips\n\n42:10.500 --> 42:11.500\nAnd fucking beer and shit\n\n42:11.500 --> 42:13.500\nLike when my older brother\n\n42:13.500 --> 42:14.500\nWorked there\n\n42:14.500 --> 42:15.500\nI heard stories\n\n42:15.500 --> 42:16.500\nOf sometimes that stuff\n\n42:16.500 --> 42:17.500\nHappening\n\n42:17.500 --> 42:18.500\nBut I'd never seen it happen\n\n42:18.500 --> 42:19.500\nAnd if I did\n\n42:19.500 --> 42:20.500\nI probably shouldn't talk about it\n\n42:20.500 --> 42:21.500\nBut honestly\n\n42:21.500 --> 42:22.500\nHonestly\n\n42:22.500 --> 42:23.500\nI haven't seen it happen\n\n42:23.500 --> 42:24.500\nSo\n\n42:24.500 --> 42:25.500\nYeah\n\n42:25.500 --> 42:26.500\nI would imagine it'd be hard to get\n\n42:26.500 --> 42:27.500\nI imagine we'd have to\n\n42:27.500 --> 42:28.500\nBecause we count it so well\n\n42:28.500 --> 42:29.500\nYeah\n\n42:29.500 --> 42:30.500\nBut like you said once\n\n42:30.500 --> 42:31.500\nWhich is one of my favorite quotes\n\n42:31.500 --> 42:32.500\nSometimes you just count less\n\n42:32.500 --> 42:33.500\nSometimes\n\n42:33.500 --> 42:34.500\nYeah\n\n42:34.500 --> 42:35.500\nThat was a joke\n\n42:35.500 --> 42:36.500\nYeah\n\n42:36.500 --> 42:38.500\nFor like a biopic\n\n42:38.500 --> 42:40.500\nWhere Spencer is like\n\n42:40.500 --> 42:42.500\nIt's like a period film\n\n42:42.500 --> 42:44.500\nCreated in the future\n\n42:44.500 --> 42:45.500\nAbout like a great\n\n42:45.500 --> 42:46.500\nApple thief\n\n42:46.500 --> 42:48.500\nWe had an idea of stealing batteries\n\n42:48.500 --> 42:49.500\nSometimes you just count less\n\n42:49.500 --> 42:52.500\nHe was Apple's most wanted\n\n42:52.500 --> 42:53.500\nSee here's the plot though\n\n42:53.500 --> 42:56.500\nWhen they swap out mice and keyboards\n\n42:56.500 --> 42:58.500\nThey give those back to us\n\n42:58.500 --> 42:59.500\nThey don't need those batteries\n\n42:59.500 --> 43:00.500\nYou take those batteries out\n\n43:00.500 --> 43:02.500\nThat's two double A's\n\n43:02.500 --> 43:05.500\nThat's a potential profit of\n\n43:05.500 --> 43:06.500\nYou know\n\n43:06.500 --> 43:07.500\nThree to four dollars on the black market\n\n43:07.500 --> 43:08.500\nYou know\n\n43:08.500 --> 43:09.500\nIt's nice\n\n43:09.500 --> 43:10.500\nYou see you're just swimming\n\n43:10.500 --> 43:11.500\nIn batteries back home\n\n43:11.500 --> 43:13.500\nJust dealing in batteries\n\n43:13.500 --> 43:14.500\nNo\n\n43:14.500 --> 43:15.500\nI don't know\n\n43:15.500 --> 43:17.500\nIt's a good idea right?\n\n43:17.500 --> 43:18.500\nNo\n\n43:18.500 --> 43:19.500\nWell I mean\n\n43:19.500 --> 43:20.500\nIt could use a little work I guess\n\n43:20.500 --> 43:21.500\nAlright\n\n43:21.500 --> 43:23.500\nOh we'll workshop it\n\n43:23.500 --> 43:25.500\nI have a retraction to make\n\n43:25.500 --> 43:28.500\nBruce Valanche\n\n43:28.500 --> 43:31.500\nWho Dan dealt a pretty strong blow to last week\n\n43:31.500 --> 43:34.500\nI said to recap as quickly as possible\n\n43:34.500 --> 43:36.500\nWhat I said and my mistake was\n\n43:36.500 --> 43:39.500\nBecause Schrab told me third hand\n\n43:39.500 --> 43:41.500\nWe were at the office and he said\n\n43:41.500 --> 43:42.500\nAnd I recounted this thing\n\n43:42.500 --> 43:44.500\nLike oh somebody wrote an article\n\n43:44.500 --> 43:46.500\nAnd they said hey you should fire Bruce Valanche\n\n43:46.500 --> 43:47.500\nFrom the Oscars\n\n43:47.500 --> 43:48.500\nThat's how you make them better\n\n43:48.500 --> 43:50.500\nBruce Valanche wrote a comment under it\n\n43:50.500 --> 43:51.500\nSaying\n\n43:51.500 --> 43:54.500\nWell I'm very sorry you don't like me\n\n43:54.500 --> 43:56.500\nBut you know we all wrote that Oscar\n\n43:56.500 --> 43:58.500\nOpening together and blah blah blah\n\n43:58.500 --> 44:01.500\nDefinitely a cautionary tale\n\n44:01.500 --> 44:03.500\nThis is how urban legends and gossip\n\n44:03.500 --> 44:04.500\nGet started because\n\n44:04.500 --> 44:05.500\nSomebody linked to that article\n\n44:05.500 --> 44:06.500\nI went and looked at it\n\n44:06.500 --> 44:08.500\nAnd Schrab was not inaccurate\n\n44:08.500 --> 44:09.500\nIn what he was reporting to me\n\n44:09.500 --> 44:13.500\nBut the Asian American telephone\n\n44:13.500 --> 44:17.500\nOf it all turned it into\n\n44:17.500 --> 44:19.500\nI don't know what the\n\n44:19.500 --> 44:21.500\nWe've been over this\n\n44:21.500 --> 44:22.500\nYou could just say telephone game\n\n44:22.500 --> 44:24.500\nWhen I was in the Midwest\n\n44:24.500 --> 44:25.500\nWhen I was in the Midwest\n\n44:25.500 --> 44:28.500\nIt was called a Chinese telephone\n\n44:28.500 --> 44:30.500\nWhy would you balk at bed?\n\n44:30.500 --> 44:33.500\nYou assumed a murderer was a black guy earlier\n\n44:33.500 --> 44:35.500\nBecause we already talked about it\n\n44:35.500 --> 44:36.500\nIn this podcast\n\n44:36.500 --> 44:37.500\nAnd I don't want to become\n\n44:37.500 --> 44:38.500\nPrairie Home Companion\n\n44:38.500 --> 44:39.500\nWhere it's just like\n\n44:39.500 --> 44:41.500\nB-bop-a-rub-bop-rub-bop-i\n\n44:41.500 --> 44:43.500\nI know I'm racist, we get it\n\n44:47.500 --> 44:49.500\nBut I looked at the article\n\n44:49.500 --> 44:50.500\nThat we were talking about\n\n44:50.500 --> 44:51.500\nFor those of you who listened\n\n44:51.500 --> 44:53.500\nTo a couple episodes back\n\n44:53.500 --> 44:55.500\nAnd I looked at the comment\n\n44:55.500 --> 44:56.500\nThat Bruce wrote\n\n44:56.500 --> 44:58.500\nAnd I don't think\n\n44:58.500 --> 44:59.500\nThat he's guilty of anything\n\n44:59.500 --> 45:01.500\nWorthy of me maligning him\n\n45:01.500 --> 45:04.500\nHe said we wrote\n\n45:04.500 --> 45:06.500\nAnd we rewrote the Oscars together\n\n45:06.500 --> 45:08.500\nWhich in general is true\n\n45:08.500 --> 45:10.500\nWe did sit there in a room together\n\n45:10.500 --> 45:11.500\nAnd try to write jokes\n\n45:11.500 --> 45:12.500\nThat Hugh Jackman should be saying\n\n45:12.500 --> 45:14.500\nHe didn't actually\n\n45:14.500 --> 45:15.500\nHe never said\n\n45:15.500 --> 45:17.500\nLike I wrote the\n\n45:17.500 --> 45:18.500\nThe reader dance or anything\n\n45:18.500 --> 45:19.500\nLike he didn't claim authorship\n\n45:19.500 --> 45:21.500\nOf anything that\n\n45:21.500 --> 45:24.500\nHe's not a weird liar, Bruce\n\n45:24.500 --> 45:26.500\nIf you're up there listening\n\n45:26.500 --> 45:28.500\nYou're just weird\n\n45:29.500 --> 45:30.500\nSo I feel bad\n\n45:30.500 --> 45:31.500\nI've also been wrong\n\n45:31.500 --> 45:32.500\nAbout other things offhand\n\n45:32.500 --> 45:35.500\nI repeated some thing\n\n45:35.500 --> 45:37.500\nErin Negati always opts out\n\n45:37.500 --> 45:39.500\nWhen we go through the TSA checkpoints\n\n45:39.500 --> 45:41.500\nAnd she keeps saying this thing\n\n45:41.500 --> 45:42.500\nThat I repeated on stage\n\n45:42.500 --> 45:43.500\nWhich is that they're not\n\n45:43.500 --> 45:44.500\nA government agency\n\n45:44.500 --> 45:45.500\nThey're a private company\n\n45:45.500 --> 45:46.500\nAnd then somebody tweeted me\n\n45:46.500 --> 45:47.500\nAnd said, what the fuck are you saying\n\n45:47.500 --> 45:48.500\nWhat are you, I looked it up\n\n45:48.500 --> 45:50.500\nAnd I said, that's not true either\n\n45:50.500 --> 45:53.500\nSo one should be careful sometimes\n\n45:53.500 --> 45:56.500\nOne should tens one's own garden\n\n45:56.500 --> 45:58.500\nThat's how you stay honest\n\n45:58.500 --> 45:59.500\nYou don't have to worry about\n\n45:59.500 --> 46:01.500\nSaying something that needs\n\n46:01.500 --> 46:02.500\nTo be retracted\n\n46:02.500 --> 46:06.500\nSpencer's mom is a lesbian\n\n46:06.500 --> 46:09.500\nYeah, so retraction there\n\n46:09.500 --> 46:11.500\nYou didn't actually end up fucking it, right?\n\n46:15.500 --> 46:18.500\nWhy do you think I would call her a lesbian?\n\n46:18.500 --> 46:20.500\nThat's a title I reserve\n\n46:20.500 --> 46:23.500\nOnly for women that won't do it with me\n\n46:23.500 --> 46:26.500\nAlright, well let's keep the bullet train\n\n46:26.500 --> 46:29.500\nSpeeding along and bring up Kumail\n\n46:29.500 --> 46:30.500\nBecause he's going to play D&D\n\n46:30.500 --> 46:37.500\nAlright, Kumail Nanjiani\n\n46:37.500 --> 46:40.500\nHello, hello\n\n46:40.500 --> 46:43.500\nI thought that was the THX sound\n\n46:43.500 --> 46:45.500\nMy congested ears heard that as the\n\n46:45.500 --> 46:46.500\nWhat was it?\n\n46:46.500 --> 46:48.500\nIt's one of our rap beats\n\n46:48.500 --> 46:50.500\nOh, rap beats\n\n46:50.500 --> 46:52.500\nPretty racist\n\n46:52.500 --> 46:55.500\nBy the way, I worked at a school\n\n46:55.500 --> 46:57.500\nThat had laptops\n\n46:57.500 --> 47:01.500\nAnd I was responsible for about 300 laptops\n\n47:01.500 --> 47:02.500\nMacbooks\n\n47:02.500 --> 47:06.500\nAnd I probably lost about 70 of them\n\n47:06.500 --> 47:08.500\nAnd then quit\n\n47:08.500 --> 47:10.500\nBefore they could count\n\n47:10.500 --> 47:12.500\nAnd I just, it sucks\n\n47:12.500 --> 47:14.500\nBecause I became friends with these people\n\n47:14.500 --> 47:15.500\nI worked there for five years\n\n47:15.500 --> 47:17.500\nAnd I was really good at having them\n\n47:17.500 --> 47:19.500\nNot find out that shit was missing\n\n47:19.500 --> 47:22.500\nThat was like the only thing I was good at\n\n47:22.500 --> 47:23.500\nAnd so when I was leaving\n\n47:23.500 --> 47:25.500\nIt was this house of cards\n\n47:25.500 --> 47:27.500\nAnd I was like, hey, I'm going to quit\n\n47:27.500 --> 47:28.500\nThey were like, what, but we need you\n\n47:28.500 --> 47:29.500\nAnd I was like, you're going to find out\n\n47:29.500 --> 47:33.500\nHow little you need me\n\n47:33.500 --> 47:35.500\nWhen you figured out how much you wish\n\n47:35.500 --> 47:37.500\nI was here to answer questions\n\n47:37.500 --> 47:38.500\nYeah, exactly\n\n47:38.500 --> 47:39.500\nAnd I just left\n\n47:39.500 --> 47:41.500\nAnd I ignored their calls\n\n47:41.500 --> 47:44.500\nAnd I just never fucking talked to them again\n\n47:44.500 --> 47:45.500\nIt wasn't my fault\n\n47:45.500 --> 47:47.500\nI never stole or sold any of them\n\n47:47.500 --> 47:49.500\nThey were just disappearing\n\n47:49.500 --> 47:50.500\nIt can happen, man\n\n47:50.500 --> 47:51.500\nI don't know what was happening\n\n47:51.500 --> 47:52.500\nCrazy, right?\n\n47:52.500 --> 47:54.500\nI should have done PI more often\n\n47:54.500 --> 47:55.500\nYeah\n\n47:55.500 --> 47:57.500\nI bet everybody's got a story\n\n47:57.500 --> 47:58.500\nAbout an early job they had\n\n47:58.500 --> 47:59.500\nWhere they walked away from it\n\n47:59.500 --> 48:01.500\nWith just, in fucking, like,\n\n48:01.500 --> 48:02.500\nIt just broke down behind you\n\n48:02.500 --> 48:03.500\nI know\n\n48:03.500 --> 48:05.500\nIf you think of like 70 computers\n\n48:05.500 --> 48:08.500\nEach one about $1,000 even\n\n48:08.500 --> 48:12.500\nThat's over $70,000\n\n48:12.500 --> 48:14.500\nAnd I just left\n\n48:14.500 --> 48:16.500\nI moved to a different city\n\n48:16.500 --> 48:18.500\nAnd I changed my career\n\n48:18.500 --> 48:20.500\nAnd I bet if they see me on TV\n\n48:20.500 --> 48:22.500\nThey're like, there's that fucker\n\n48:22.500 --> 48:24.500\nBecause I swear to you\n\n48:24.500 --> 48:26.500\nThat program went under\n\n48:26.500 --> 48:28.500\nThe year after I left\n\n48:28.500 --> 48:30.500\nThe birdie made off of Apple\n\n48:30.500 --> 48:33.500\nBut I had to benefit from it\n\n48:33.500 --> 48:34.500\nSo somebody there was pinching him\n\n48:34.500 --> 48:35.500\nLike somebody was\n\n48:35.500 --> 48:36.500\nI don't know\n\n48:36.500 --> 48:37.500\nThis was on the south side of Chicago\n\n48:37.500 --> 48:38.500\nWhich is like a pretty rough area\n\n48:38.500 --> 48:40.500\nAnd kids were always getting over\n\n48:40.500 --> 48:41.500\nIt's the baddest part of town\n\n48:41.500 --> 48:43.500\nYeah, bad, bad\n\n48:43.500 --> 48:44.500\nYeah\n\n48:44.500 --> 48:46.500\nLeroy Brown, is that what we're doing?\n\n48:46.500 --> 48:49.500\nYes, we're doing bad, bad, Leroy Brown right now\n\n48:49.500 --> 48:51.500\nFuck you, man\n\n48:51.500 --> 48:53.500\nHe's suckered me into that\n\n48:53.500 --> 48:55.500\nI hate Jim Croci\n\n48:55.500 --> 48:57.500\nI'm just saying, Camille\n\n48:57.500 --> 48:58.500\nIf you go down there\n\n48:58.500 --> 49:00.500\nYou better just beware\n\n49:00.500 --> 49:03.500\nOf a man named Leroy Brown\n\n49:03.500 --> 49:07.500\nThese children don't know what you're talking about\n\n49:07.500 --> 49:10.500\nYou're just being a weird old man right now\n\n49:10.500 --> 49:12.500\nMy rendition is so accurate\n\n49:12.500 --> 49:16.500\nThat you could shazam this conversation\n\n49:16.500 --> 49:17.500\nHe got it back\n\n49:17.500 --> 49:21.500\nI had also shazam sort of thing, right?\n\n49:21.500 --> 49:22.500\nYou still shazam?\n\n49:22.500 --> 49:24.500\nWas it called like Bahuqui?\n\n49:24.500 --> 49:26.500\nI don't know\n\n49:26.500 --> 49:28.500\nBahuqui\n\n49:28.500 --> 49:29.500\nWith cops, by the way\n\n49:29.500 --> 49:31.500\nI grew up, like I said, in Pakistan\n\n49:31.500 --> 49:32.500\nAnd it's so corrupt there\n\n49:32.500 --> 49:34.500\nLike the cops are just uniformly bad\n\n49:34.500 --> 49:35.500\nPakistan in India\n\n49:35.500 --> 49:37.500\nIf you watch any movies from the 80s and 90s\n\n49:37.500 --> 49:39.500\nThe bad guys were always cops\n\n49:39.500 --> 49:40.500\nAlways cops\n\n49:40.500 --> 49:41.500\nSo I like moved\n\n49:41.500 --> 49:42.500\nAnd I fucking like\n\n49:42.500 --> 49:43.500\nI hate them\n\n49:43.500 --> 49:45.500\nAnd I'm like\n\n49:45.500 --> 49:46.500\nI don't know\n\n49:46.500 --> 49:48.500\nIt's terrible because you can't think of a worse job\n\n49:48.500 --> 49:50.500\nA job that no one would rather do\n\n49:50.500 --> 49:53.500\nI think it's like school teachers, cops\n\n49:53.500 --> 49:56.500\nLet's throw in stylists\n\n49:56.500 --> 49:58.500\nLike we need to\n\n49:58.500 --> 49:59.500\nNo, I'm kidding on the last one\n\n49:59.500 --> 50:00.500\nWe need to\n\n50:00.500 --> 50:03.500\nJust school teachers and cops\n\n50:03.500 --> 50:06.500\nWe obviously need them\n\n50:06.500 --> 50:08.500\nDon't you think you break the cycle\n\n50:08.500 --> 50:10.500\nBy throwing a\n\n50:10.500 --> 50:12.500\nIn a country where we kind of\n\n50:12.500 --> 50:14.500\nWe do tend to\n\n50:14.500 --> 50:16.500\nI know that every penny counts\n\n50:16.500 --> 50:18.500\nBut we also have spent\n\n50:18.500 --> 50:19.500\nMore on worse\n\n50:19.500 --> 50:21.500\nLike don't you break the cycle by like going\n\n50:21.500 --> 50:22.500\nHey from now on\n\n50:22.500 --> 50:23.500\nBeing a cop\n\n50:23.500 --> 50:24.500\nPays a lot\n\n50:24.500 --> 50:26.500\nLike don't you think\n\n50:26.500 --> 50:28.500\nBecause right now we're at this place where it's like\n\n50:28.500 --> 50:29.500\nDoesn't pay that much\n\n50:29.500 --> 50:30.500\nAnd you might get shot\n\n50:30.500 --> 50:31.500\nYeah\n\n50:31.500 --> 50:33.500\nSo the people who go into it\n\n50:33.500 --> 50:34.500\nLike you need cops\n\n50:34.500 --> 50:36.500\nBut a lot of people who become cops\n\n50:36.500 --> 50:38.500\nYou don't want to be cops\n\n50:38.500 --> 50:41.500\nI was walking across the street\n\n50:41.500 --> 50:42.500\nI was jaywalking\n\n50:42.500 --> 50:44.500\nWith my wife\n\n50:44.500 --> 50:46.500\nWho's not very threatening looking at all\n\n50:46.500 --> 50:48.500\nAnd these fucking cops pulled up\n\n50:48.500 --> 50:50.500\nAnd they started yelling at us\n\n50:50.500 --> 50:53.500\nAnd like they had me up against the wall\n\n50:53.500 --> 50:54.500\nHands behind my back\n\n50:54.500 --> 50:56.500\nAnd I was so fucking angry\n\n50:56.500 --> 50:57.500\nI was asking them\n\n50:57.500 --> 50:58.500\nI swear I was like\n\n50:58.500 --> 51:01.500\nSo this is the biggest bust you've had\n\n51:01.500 --> 51:02.500\nAnd I was like\n\n51:02.500 --> 51:04.500\nSo is this why you got into the game\n\n51:04.500 --> 51:07.500\nI called it the game\n\n51:07.500 --> 51:08.500\nAnd Emily's like\n\n51:08.500 --> 51:09.500\nWhat'd you say?\n\n51:09.500 --> 51:10.500\nWhat'd you say?\n\n51:10.500 --> 51:12.500\nOf course Emily just\n\n51:12.500 --> 51:15.500\nAnd I'd just done a show at the echo\n\n51:15.500 --> 51:17.500\nAnd I'd left a bit early\n\n51:17.500 --> 51:18.500\nSo while I'm there\n\n51:18.500 --> 51:21.500\nAll the people who'd just seen me at the show\n\n51:21.500 --> 51:22.500\nAre walking by\n\n51:22.500 --> 51:23.500\nAnd they're like\n\n51:23.500 --> 51:24.500\nHey great show\n\n51:24.500 --> 51:25.500\nI'm like okay cool\n\n51:25.500 --> 51:28.500\nNot a good time right now\n\n51:28.500 --> 51:29.500\nPretty cool\n\n51:29.500 --> 51:30.500\nOh my god\n\n51:30.500 --> 51:31.500\nThe next week you were opening though\n\n51:31.500 --> 51:32.500\nOr wait\n\n51:32.500 --> 51:33.500\nOpening's bad\n\n51:33.500 --> 51:36.500\nClosing\n\n51:36.500 --> 51:38.500\nMy brain is dying\n\n51:38.500 --> 51:41.500\nBy the way have you seen posters for Sharknado?\n\n51:41.500 --> 51:42.500\nNo\n\n51:42.500 --> 51:45.500\nThere's a movie called Sharknado\n\n51:45.500 --> 51:49.500\nIt's set in Oklahoma\n\n51:49.500 --> 51:51.500\nDuring tornado season\n\n51:51.500 --> 51:53.500\nYeah and it's a tornado\n\n51:53.500 --> 51:55.500\nAnd the poster is\n\n51:55.500 --> 51:57.500\nThere's a hand drawn like a tornado\n\n51:57.500 --> 51:59.500\nWith like shark heads poking out of it\n\n51:59.500 --> 52:00.500\nWhich you'd be like\n\n52:00.500 --> 52:01.500\nAre you saying it better is it real?\n\n52:01.500 --> 52:02.500\nNo no no\n\n52:02.500 --> 52:03.500\nThis is real\n\n52:03.500 --> 52:04.500\nOh I thought you were just doing a fucking thing\n\n52:04.500 --> 52:05.500\nNo no\n\n52:05.500 --> 52:06.500\nThis is real\n\n52:06.500 --> 52:07.500\nThat's the problem\n\n52:07.500 --> 52:08.500\nIt's real\n\n52:08.500 --> 52:09.500\nSharknado\n\n52:09.500 --> 52:10.500\nThey would be like nothing\n\n52:10.500 --> 52:13.500\nThey'd be dead right?\n\n52:13.500 --> 52:14.500\nYes\n\n52:14.500 --> 52:15.500\nThese sharks\n\n52:15.500 --> 52:16.500\nThey're dizzy and dead\n\n52:16.500 --> 52:20.500\nIf you're auditioning for the role of the mayor\n\n52:20.500 --> 52:21.500\nIn the first act\n\n52:21.500 --> 52:22.500\nYeah\n\n52:22.500 --> 52:23.500\nYou're hired\n\n52:23.500 --> 52:24.500\nGuys we have nothing to worry about\n\n52:24.500 --> 52:26.500\nCome on they'd be dead\n\n52:26.500 --> 52:27.500\nThey're dead\n\n52:27.500 --> 52:29.500\nCan I be the sharkologist?\n\n52:29.500 --> 52:31.500\nYes the annual corn festival stays open\n\n52:31.500 --> 52:35.500\nWe've known two things about sharks for 50,000 years\n\n52:35.500 --> 52:37.500\nOne is that they live under water\n\n52:37.500 --> 52:39.500\nTwo is that they can't stop moving\n\n52:39.500 --> 52:42.500\nWe thought the first thing was what was keeping them alive\n\n52:42.500 --> 52:44.500\nYou're good Jan\n\n52:44.500 --> 52:47.500\nIt turns out they only have to keep moving\n\n52:47.500 --> 52:50.500\nNo one has ever kept a shark moving out of water\n\n52:50.500 --> 52:52.500\nAnd just like a truck shark\n\n52:52.500 --> 52:54.500\nWhat if the tornado is water\n\n52:54.500 --> 52:55.500\nWhatever's a water tornado\n\n52:55.500 --> 52:57.500\nYou're talking about a hurricane\n\n52:57.500 --> 52:59.500\nThat's the sequel\n\n52:59.500 --> 53:03.500\nBut there's one house that won't be taken over by the sharknado\n\n53:03.500 --> 53:04.500\nShark house\n\n53:04.500 --> 53:06.500\nMonster house\n\n53:06.500 --> 53:08.500\nYou should have a movie called Shark House\n\n53:08.500 --> 53:10.500\nI'll find the sharknado picture for you to prove\n\n53:10.500 --> 53:12.500\nThat it wasn't just a lame bid I was doing\n\n53:12.500 --> 53:13.500\nIt's a real movie\n\n53:13.500 --> 53:14.500\nNo you don't have to prove it\n\n53:14.500 --> 53:16.500\nThat's the sad thing is that now irony has become\n\n53:16.500 --> 53:17.500\nI think it's a good thing\n\n53:17.500 --> 53:19.500\nIt's an invitation now to like\n\n53:19.500 --> 53:22.500\nI think that we used to live in a world where\n\n53:22.500 --> 53:25.500\nThe division between the people who made entertainment\n\n53:25.500 --> 53:27.500\nAnd the people that consumed it was so thick\n\n53:27.500 --> 53:30.500\nThat it was one of the most enjoyable things\n\n53:30.500 --> 53:32.500\nWas them doing their job wrong\n\n53:32.500 --> 53:34.500\nAnd now we can all do it anyway\n\n53:34.500 --> 53:35.500\nSo now it's like\n\n53:35.500 --> 53:37.500\nNow of course the first thing we're going to do is go\n\n53:37.500 --> 53:41.500\nHey this show is called Dick, Dick, Dick Gater\n\n53:41.500 --> 53:43.500\nIs it part Dick, part Gater?\n\n53:43.500 --> 53:45.500\nI thought it was a Gater who's like a dick\n\n53:45.500 --> 53:47.500\nIs it?\n\n53:47.500 --> 53:49.500\nDoosh crocodile\n\n53:49.500 --> 53:50.500\nBut here's my problem\n\n53:50.500 --> 53:51.500\nIf the reality is a thing\n\n53:51.500 --> 53:52.500\nIs it already out?\n\n53:52.500 --> 53:53.500\nOr is it no?\n\n53:53.500 --> 53:54.500\nHere's the poster\n\n53:54.500 --> 53:55.500\nI forgot to mention this\n\n53:55.500 --> 53:57.500\nThe tagline is enough said\n\n53:57.500 --> 53:59.500\nNo\n\n53:59.500 --> 54:01.500\nNo I think we need a bit more\n\n54:01.500 --> 54:02.500\nNo\n\n54:02.500 --> 54:03.500\nLook at that\n\n54:03.500 --> 54:04.500\nNot enough said\n\n54:04.500 --> 54:05.500\nEnough said\n\n54:05.500 --> 54:06.500\nEnough said\n\n54:06.500 --> 54:07.500\nNo the sharks are dead\n\n54:07.500 --> 54:09.500\nEnough said exclamation point\n\n54:09.500 --> 54:10.500\nWhich is another weird thing\n\n54:10.500 --> 54:12.500\nEnough said\n\n54:12.500 --> 54:13.500\nBut how about this\n\n54:13.500 --> 54:16.500\nThere is a thing that's already being made called\n\n54:16.500 --> 54:18.500\nSharknado\n\n54:18.500 --> 54:20.500\nBut the one Adam Goldberg was talking about\n\n54:20.500 --> 54:22.500\nIs called Avalanche Shark\n\n54:22.500 --> 54:24.500\nThey didn't even go like Sharkalanche\n\n54:24.500 --> 54:26.500\nOr\n\n54:26.500 --> 54:27.500\nShark\n\n54:27.500 --> 54:30.500\nSharks are officially the new ninja\n\n54:30.500 --> 54:32.500\nBut Avalanche colon shark\n\n54:32.500 --> 54:34.500\nLike Mission Colon Impossible\n\n54:34.500 --> 54:35.500\nI don't even know it was both\n\n54:35.500 --> 54:36.500\nAnd it was neither\n\n54:36.500 --> 54:37.500\nIt was Avalanche shark\n\n54:37.500 --> 54:38.500\nThen it was Shark Avalanche\n\n54:38.500 --> 54:40.500\nThen it was Avalanche sharks\n\n54:40.500 --> 54:41.500\nWhen they had three puppets\n\n54:41.500 --> 54:43.500\nAnd then they cut back on the number of puppets\n\n54:43.500 --> 54:46.500\nAnd then they cut back on the number of production managers\n\n54:46.500 --> 54:49.500\nAnd that's when you jump a ship\n\n54:49.500 --> 54:52.500\nAnd then it became an evening with a shark\n\n54:52.500 --> 54:54.500\nOff-Broadway\n\n54:54.500 --> 54:56.500\nJust so yeah\n\n54:56.500 --> 54:58.500\nI was born a little shark\n\n54:58.500 --> 55:00.500\nAnd then it finally became Argo\n\n55:00.500 --> 55:02.500\nThat's how Hollywood works\n\n55:02.500 --> 55:04.500\nYeah, it's crazy\n\n55:04.500 --> 55:06.500\nHood rewrite\n\n55:06.500 --> 55:08.500\nSo I'm going to guess\n\n55:08.500 --> 55:12.500\nTremors was a kind of a parody of Jaws\n\n55:12.500 --> 55:15.500\nLike Tremors was written like in the 70s\n\n55:15.500 --> 55:16.500\nReally?\n\n55:16.500 --> 55:17.500\nAfter Jaws was popular\n\n55:17.500 --> 55:19.500\nThey wrote this script that was like\n\n55:19.500 --> 55:22.500\nThey're sharks but they're under dirt instead of water\n\n55:22.500 --> 55:24.500\nAnd it took that long for Tremors to come out\n\n55:24.500 --> 55:26.500\nI like Tremors because\n\n55:26.500 --> 55:28.500\nThis is the third one where they start flying\n\n55:28.500 --> 55:29.500\nYeah\n\n55:29.500 --> 55:31.500\nAnd then the fourth one is\n\n55:31.500 --> 55:33.500\nBecause Michael Gross is the only one who keeps coming back\n\n55:33.500 --> 55:34.500\nHe's done all of them\n\n55:34.500 --> 55:37.500\nSo there's one that's set in the Wild West\n\n55:37.500 --> 55:38.500\nIt's a prequel\n\n55:38.500 --> 55:40.500\nAnd there's Tremors there\n\n55:40.500 --> 55:43.500\nAnd Michael Gross's ancestor fights him\n\n55:43.500 --> 55:44.500\nWhich at that point\n\n55:44.500 --> 55:45.500\nPlayed by whom?\n\n55:45.500 --> 55:46.500\nMichael Gross\n\n55:46.500 --> 55:47.500\nHe's back\n\n55:47.500 --> 55:51.500\nThat should have like made the news or the lore\n\n55:51.500 --> 55:52.500\nAnd they should have been like\n\n55:52.500 --> 55:53.500\nHey stay away from this area\n\n55:53.500 --> 55:54.500\nLike 200 years ago\n\n55:54.500 --> 55:56.500\nThese fucking Tremors showed up\n\n55:56.500 --> 55:58.500\nAnd what are the odds that Michael Gross comes back\n\n55:58.500 --> 55:59.500\nOf guys out there\n\n55:59.500 --> 56:00.500\nWell a lot of problems\n\n56:00.500 --> 56:01.500\nThey register the local radar of one guy\n\n56:01.500 --> 56:02.500\nWho stayed in this basement\n\n56:02.500 --> 56:03.500\nAnd started hoarding firearms\n\n56:03.500 --> 56:04.500\nIt holds up\n\n56:04.500 --> 56:08.500\nI like the Tremors saga\n\n56:11.500 --> 56:12.500\nShall we play some D&D?\n\n56:12.500 --> 56:13.500\nLet's do it\n\n56:13.500 --> 56:14.500\nAlright, Aaron McAthee\n\n56:14.500 --> 56:15.500\nWould you join us on stage please?\n\n56:21.500 --> 56:22.500\nOh Jesus Christ\n\n56:22.500 --> 56:24.500\nDon't ever ever ever sneak up\n\n56:24.500 --> 56:25.500\nI'm gonna go\n\n56:25.500 --> 56:26.500\nHello\n\n56:26.500 --> 56:27.500\nAaron McAthee everyone\n\n56:27.500 --> 56:28.500\nHey guys\n\n56:30.500 --> 56:31.500\nSharks\n\n56:31.500 --> 56:32.500\nYeah\n\n56:33.500 --> 56:34.500\nHer mic is not on\n\n56:35.500 --> 56:36.500\nGive it a try\n\n56:36.500 --> 56:37.500\nSharks\n\n56:37.500 --> 56:38.500\nThere we go\n\n56:39.500 --> 56:40.500\nShark lobby\n\n56:41.500 --> 56:42.500\nIt's good news though\n\n56:42.500 --> 56:44.500\nThere'll have to be a new\n\n56:44.500 --> 56:47.500\nThere's gonna be a nerd shark movie soon I bet\n\n56:47.500 --> 56:48.500\nLike a half nerd half shark\n\n56:48.500 --> 56:49.500\nHe's just like\n\n56:49.500 --> 56:51.500\nBecause nerds are the big thing right now\n\n56:51.500 --> 56:53.500\nShack called himself a geek today\n\n56:53.500 --> 56:54.500\nSo I'm like\n\n56:54.500 --> 56:55.500\nCome on\n\n56:56.500 --> 56:58.500\nNerds will have to come up with new ways\n\n56:58.500 --> 57:04.500\nLike somehow the robot ninja Abraham Lincoln\n\n57:04.500 --> 57:07.500\nShark laser\n\n57:07.500 --> 57:08.500\nLike kind of like\n\n57:08.500 --> 57:09.500\nThat concept\n\n57:09.500 --> 57:10.500\nThat all comes from the\n\n57:10.500 --> 57:11.500\nPirate\n\n57:11.500 --> 57:13.500\nIt comes from this period of time when it was like\n\n57:13.500 --> 57:15.500\nWe were being dispensed to entertainment\n\n57:15.500 --> 57:16.500\nBy this big thing\n\n57:16.500 --> 57:18.500\nSo there's like this wacky packages irony\n\n57:18.500 --> 57:19.500\nGoing on to it\n\n57:19.500 --> 57:21.500\nThese aren't crayola crayons\n\n57:21.500 --> 57:22.500\nThese are crackola crayons\n\n57:22.500 --> 57:23.500\nSo I guess it's a\n\n57:23.500 --> 57:25.500\nWe're living in a kind of a\n\n57:25.500 --> 57:27.500\nSatirically dead age\n\n57:27.500 --> 57:30.500\nThat will be a precursor to like a new\n\n57:30.500 --> 57:31.500\nI think\n\n57:31.500 --> 57:32.500\nA new reckoning\n\n57:32.500 --> 57:34.500\nWhere I will be completely like\n\n57:34.500 --> 57:36.500\nI'll just be a dinosaur\n\n57:36.500 --> 57:37.500\nAs if I'm not already\n\n57:37.500 --> 57:38.500\nBut I'll be absolutely\n\n57:38.500 --> 57:39.500\nI don't even know why that's funny\n\n57:39.500 --> 57:40.500\nAnd everyone will be like\n\n57:40.500 --> 57:41.500\nExactly\n\n57:41.500 --> 57:42.500\nStep aside\n\n57:43.500 --> 57:45.500\nThere's some shows on Adult Swim\n\n57:45.500 --> 57:47.500\nThat make me feel so old\n\n57:47.500 --> 57:48.500\nI don't know\n\n57:49.500 --> 57:50.500\nYeah\n\n57:50.500 --> 57:52.500\nI've watched like\n\n57:52.500 --> 57:54.500\nWhat like Squidbillies\n\n57:56.500 --> 57:57.500\nHave you seen that show?\n\n57:57.500 --> 57:58.500\nI don't know\n\n57:58.500 --> 57:59.500\nIt's impenetrable\n\n58:01.500 --> 58:02.500\nI'll tell you something\n\n58:02.500 --> 58:03.500\nI watched that made me feel 20\n\n58:03.500 --> 58:05.500\nIt was like the most powerful guy in the room\n\n58:05.500 --> 58:08.500\nThis movie, the ABC's of horror\n\n58:08.500 --> 58:09.500\nOh how is that?\n\n58:10.500 --> 58:13.500\nIt should be called 26 Channel 101 rejections\n\n58:13.500 --> 58:16.500\nWhat also\n\n58:16.500 --> 58:17.500\nSucks about that format\n\n58:17.500 --> 58:18.500\nIs that you're hyper aware\n\n58:18.500 --> 58:20.500\nOf how much of the movie is left\n\n58:20.500 --> 58:21.500\nYeah\n\n58:21.500 --> 58:22.500\nBecause you're like\n\n58:22.500 --> 58:23.500\nI'm only at the G\n\n58:23.500 --> 58:24.500\nYeah\n\n58:24.500 --> 58:25.500\nThe good thing about it\n\n58:25.500 --> 58:26.500\nIs knowing you're never\n\n58:26.500 --> 58:27.500\nMore than three minutes away\n\n58:27.500 --> 58:28.500\nFrom another\n\n58:31.500 --> 58:32.500\nBut you start to go\n\n58:32.500 --> 58:33.500\nLike it's not starting\n\n58:33.500 --> 58:34.500\nIt's never going to start\n\n58:34.500 --> 58:35.500\nAnd even if it does start\n\n58:35.500 --> 58:37.500\nIt's going to putter out\n\n58:37.500 --> 58:38.500\nFour minutes\n\n58:38.500 --> 58:39.500\nYeah\n\n58:39.500 --> 58:40.500\nI think we started feeling pretty\n\n58:40.500 --> 58:41.500\nOCD about it\n\n58:41.500 --> 58:43.500\nLike we're already 20 in\n\n58:43.500 --> 58:44.500\nWell we started the first 11\n\n58:44.500 --> 58:45.500\nKept going like\n\n58:45.500 --> 58:46.500\nSo C is for\n\n58:46.500 --> 58:47.500\nCarnival\n\n58:47.500 --> 58:48.500\nC is for that\n\n58:48.500 --> 58:49.500\nAnd then we started going\n\n58:49.500 --> 58:50.500\nWhat are we doing?\n\n58:50.500 --> 58:51.500\nIt doesn't matter\n\n58:51.500 --> 58:52.500\nBecause somebody actually told me\n\n58:52.500 --> 58:54.500\nThat it was a part of that project\n\n58:54.500 --> 58:55.500\nThey said\n\n58:55.500 --> 58:56.500\nYeah we got them and\n\n58:56.500 --> 58:57.500\nWe had to shuffle the order\n\n58:57.500 --> 58:58.500\nBecause we had to\n\n58:58.500 --> 59:00.500\nSo we started pretending\n\n59:00.500 --> 59:02.500\nThat the letter was different\n\n59:02.500 --> 59:04.500\nLike if you made a shitty one\n\n59:04.500 --> 59:06.500\nCalled the H is for helicopter\n\n59:06.500 --> 59:07.500\nBecause it couldn't guys head up\n\n59:07.500 --> 59:08.500\nBut it was so shitty\n\n59:08.500 --> 59:09.500\nThey would just go\n\n59:09.500 --> 59:10.500\nLet's just say\n\n59:10.500 --> 59:11.500\nP is for pilot\n\n59:11.500 --> 59:12.500\nYeah\n\n59:12.500 --> 59:14.500\nAnd let's tell the P guy\n\n59:14.500 --> 59:16.500\nThat it might fly on that one\n\n59:16.500 --> 59:17.500\nWow that sucks\n\n59:18.500 --> 59:19.500\nYeah it was very clear\n\n59:19.500 --> 59:20.500\nThat the words didn't inspire\n\n59:20.500 --> 59:21.500\nThe horror\n\n59:21.500 --> 59:23.500\nAlso barely any horror\n\n59:23.500 --> 59:25.500\nLiterally like four or five\n\n59:26.500 --> 59:27.500\nAnd I say in quotes\n\n59:27.500 --> 59:28.500\nScary ones\n\n59:28.500 --> 59:30.500\nThere was a cartoon about a woman\n\n59:30.500 --> 59:32.500\nTrying to get her poop inside a toilet\n\n59:32.500 --> 59:33.500\nWhat do you mean?\n\n59:33.500 --> 59:34.500\nThat\n\n59:36.500 --> 59:37.500\nIs the poop out of her\n\n59:37.500 --> 59:38.500\nOr is it in her?\n\n59:38.500 --> 59:40.500\nThere's a woman\n\n59:40.500 --> 59:41.500\nIt was animated\n\n59:41.500 --> 59:42.500\nIs this P?\n\n59:43.500 --> 59:44.500\nNo this is poop\n\n59:44.500 --> 59:45.500\nNo it's P\n\n59:46.500 --> 59:47.500\nNo\n\n59:47.500 --> 59:48.500\nNice nice\n\n59:49.500 --> 59:50.500\nClassic\n\n59:50.500 --> 59:51.500\nThank you very much\n\n59:51.500 --> 59:53.500\nWe're gonna be touring together\n\n59:53.500 --> 59:55.500\nShoes and socks ladies and gentlemen\n\n59:55.500 --> 59:56.500\nYeah\n\n59:56.500 --> 59:57.500\nCheese shoes\n\n59:57.500 --> 59:58.500\nAnd I'm Camille\n\n01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.500\nWhat do you say Camille?\n\n01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.500\nShoes you gotta get in\n\n01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.500\nAlright it's D&D time\n\n01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.500\nI'd say on that note\n\n01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.500\nThat's my catchphrase\n\n01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.500\nSpencer if you would\n\n01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.500\nCatch us up\n\n01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.500\nWhen we last met\n\n01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.500\nThe group was plumbing\n\n01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.500\nThe depths of the ruins of Mershuil\n\n01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500\nChristopher was caught\n\n01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.500\nIn a deadly wall crashing trap\n\n01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.500\nThinking quickly\n\n01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.500\nThe rogue found a narrow escape\n\n01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500\nAnd left with great alacrity\n\n01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.500\nThrough a hole in the floor\n\n01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.500\nLanding in a dank dark chamber\n\n01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.500\nSharpie quirk and Mulraine\n\n01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.500\nWere not far behind\n\n01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.500\nAnd after some crossed wires\n\n01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.500\nThe group managed to slide down\n\n01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500\nThe button staff\n\n01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.500\nWorking on unlocking the chamber door\n\n01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.500\nThe rogue toiled\n\n01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.500\nWhile the rest of the gang\n\n01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.500\nSearched the room\n\n01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.500\nIt wasn't long before the group\n\n01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.500\nWas besieged by snakes\n\n01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.500\nAfter seeming to fall\n\n01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.500\nFor Mulraine's animal husbandry\n\n01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.500\nThe snakes transformed into Yuan T\n\n01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.500\nSinister serpent people\n\n01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.500\nAfter putting on a seemingly\n\n01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.500\nClever disguise\n\n01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.500\nThe hat of disguise\n\n01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.500\nThe gang tried to convince the snakes\n\n01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500\nThey were holding a hostage\n\n01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.500\nBut quarks talking dagger\n\n01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.500\nRuined the gang\n\n01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.500\nWith his sharp tongue\n\n01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.500\nAnd foul move\n\n01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.500\nDown but not out\n\n01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.500\nThey launched into a new gag\n\n01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.500\nQuark creeping behind the lead snake\n\n01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.500\nAnd Sharpie pushing him over the\n\n01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.500\nCrouch hapland\n\n01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.500\nTripping him\n\n01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.500\nThis spooked the snake people\n\n01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.500\nInto losing their volos of poison arrows\n\n01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.500\nWhich struck Sharpie in his chest and arm\n\n01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.500\nHe began to feel drowsy\n\n01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.500\nAnd as if he was feeling numb\n\n01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.500\nThe party managed to kill two of the foes\n\n01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.500\nBefore the last member of the group\n\n01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.500\nFled in snake form\n\n01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.500\nManaging to elude the party's grasp\n\n01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.500\nAfter combat ended\n\n01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.500\nThe rogue managed to finish\n\n01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.500\nPicking the lock on the door\n\n01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:37.500\nPeering through the clack\n\n01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.500\nCrack at the massive treasure room\n\n01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.500\nFor them\n\n01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.500\nJust then Sharpie felt a rush of dizziness\n\n01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.500\nAnd lost consciousness\n\n01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.500\nThump\n\n01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.500\nHe did it again!\n\n01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.500\nAlright\n\n01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500\nI'm convinced Spencer\n\n01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500\nThat you've listened to this podcast\n\n01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500\nYou've timed out the music cue\n\n01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500\nAnd you write this\n\n01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.500\nTo be timed perfectly to this\n\n01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.500\nI mean, the thing is\n\n01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.500\nI write it on my iPad nowadays\n\n01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.500\nAnd I just write the same size of the text\n\n01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.500\nIt works amazing\n\n01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.500\nI heard there's a video of you\n\n01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.500\nThe way there is of Bruce Springsteen\n\n01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500\nPracticing his opening\n\n01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.500\nNo? Okay\n\n01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.500\nThere's an urban legend\n\n01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.500\nOr a real tape out there\n\n01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.500\nI don't know if it's just an urban legend\n\n01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.500\nOr if there's a real tape\n\n01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500\nBut somebody slept over at Bruce Springsteen's house\n\n01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.500\nAnd found a tape of him\n\n01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:32.500\nA VHS tape of him practicing\n\n01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.500\nDancing in the dark in a mirror\n\n01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.500\nReally?\n\n01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.500\nCirculating around\n\n01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.500\nIt's probably an urban legend\n\n01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.500\nFrom like back in the day?\n\n01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.500\nYeah, yeah\n\n01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.500\nWas it like the Metallica drummer guy?\n\n01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.500\nThe guy that drummed the entire black album?\n\n01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.500\nWe know that exists, right?\n\n01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.500\nYeah, that was fucking great\n\n01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.500\nAlright, so what's going on?\n\n01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.500\nWe're looking through a crack in the thing\n\n01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.500\nBruce Springsteen?\n\n01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.500\nHe was a guy\n\n01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.500\nDuring Reaganomics\n\n01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.500\nWe had to make sure it was extra cool\n\n01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.500\nTo be lower class\n\n01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.500\nReaganomics\n\n01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.500\nSo he rolled out some rich people\n\n01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.500\nWith bandanas\n\n01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.500\nThat was the best class in history\n\n01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.500\nWas Reaganomics\n\n01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.500\nI mean glossary term\n\n01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.500\nWho?\n\n01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.500\nCan we see that Sharpie's fallen down?\n\n01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.500\nWho is Sharpie?\n\n01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.500\nYeah, that's Dan\n\n01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.500\nOh, okay\n\n01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:25.500\nCan I have like an HBO original series dream sequence?\n\n01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.500\nYeah, you're in a dungeon though\n\n01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.500\nI mean like\n\n01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.500\nYou're having a dream sequence\n\n01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.500\nBut I'm unconscious\n\n01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.500\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.500\nOkay, so yeah\n\n01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.500\nSo I'm on a beach\n\n01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.500\nWe don't know that\n\n01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.500\nAnd then someone is getting stabbed\n\n01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.500\nAnd look out over the ocean\n\n01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.500\nAnd instead of the sun rising over it\n\n01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:50.500\nIt's my dad's head\n\n01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.500\nAnd I start to run away\n\n01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:55.500\nAnd I run through a nearby jungle\n\n01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.500\nAnd I come to a cabin\n\n01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.500\nAnd I go inside and there's a birthday cake\n\n01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.500\nAnd there's 13 candles on it\n\n01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500\nAnd a fish in the middle\n\n01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.500\nAnd I pick up the fish\n\n01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.500\nAnd it looks at me and says\n\n01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.500\nSopranos reference\n\n01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.500\nSo I put it down\n\n01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500\nAnd I go with my second thought\n\n01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.500\nI go to a fireplace\n\n01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.500\nAnd I start to stoke the flame\n\n01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.500\nBut there's nothing but oatmeal in it\n\n01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.500\nThen I wake up\n\n01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.500\nOr cut to them\n\n01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.500\nCut to them\n\n01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.500\nHey, what do you guys think he's dreaming about?\n\n01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.500\nSame old stuff, probably\n\n01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.500\nSo I'm working on the log\n\n01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500\nWhat's, huh?\n\n01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:43.500\nI'm working on the lock\n\n01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.500\nYou had just picked the lock\n\n01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.500\nAnd you guys had opened it\n\n01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.500\nAnd you would see it in the room\n\n01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.500\nYeah, there's treasure\n\n01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.500\nLet me see here\n\n01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.500\nYou can see a large stone chamber\n\n01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.500\nIn the center of which is three large humanoid statues\n\n01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.500\nAnd next to them is a small wooden shed\n\n01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.500\nAnd a few wooden buckets\n\n01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.500\nBehind the statues is a massive stone staircase\n\n01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.500\nLeading up about 80 feet in large tiered steps\n\n01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.500\nAt the top is a massive sarcophagus\n\n01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.500\nMade of obsidian, it's surrounded by several chests and barrels\n\n01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.500\nAnd baskets of goods, I should say\n\n01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.500\nHeaped up in some form of tribute\n\n01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.500\nIn the middle of the staircase is a massive deep black crack\n\n01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.500\nAnd inky darkness blocks out any light\n\n01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.500\nThat you could help see into the small cave\n\n01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.500\nYou see coins tossed around the cavern\n\n01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.500\nI mean the chamber\n\n01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.500\nIt's a chamber\n\n01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.500\nDo I have any sort of antidote or something I can use on them?\n\n01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.500\nI don't know\n\n01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.500\nI mean, what is, does it say anything like that?\n\n01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.500\nYou should know\n\n01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.500\nI mean, what is, does it say anything like that?\n\n01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.500\nYou shouldn't\n\n01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.500\nI shouldn't?\n\n01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.500\nI don't think so\n\n01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.500\nWell, you created me, so I'm sure I don't\n\n01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.500\nYeah, but it happened a while ago\n\n01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.500\nI have heel-moderate wounds, do I not?\n\n01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:50.500\nYeah, but this is more of like a sleep, a sleeping poison\n\n01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.500\nOh, it's not deadly\n\n01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.500\nWell, you don't know, really\n\n01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.500\nYou saw, it's freaky, you know\n\n01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:00.500\nI reach into my sack and take out a pen\n\n01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.500\nAnd I draw a dick and balls on his forehead\n\n01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.500\nI teabag him\n\n01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.500\nYeah\n\n01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.500\nAnd I put like a cover of him in swastikas\n\n01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:12.500\nAnd we tried to get the horse to fuck\n\n01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.500\nI take his hand and I pretend that we're getting married\n\n01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.500\nI put his other hand in a bucket of warm water\n\n01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.500\nAnd then I just piss on his hand\n\n01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:30.500\nNot intuitively, I piss on his hand\n\n01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.500\nThis weirdly brings the three of us together\n\n01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.500\nNo, because that's a way to revive somebody\n\n01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.500\nIn a barbarian clan, so we would frequently\n\n01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.500\nTo pee on someone's hand was a great way\n\n01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.500\nTo bring them out of a stupor\n\n01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.500\nWas it a great way?\n\n01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.500\nSounds like the worst way\n\n01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.500\nIt was the only way\n\n01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500\nOkay\n\n01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.500\nWe should probably look through, go up\n\n01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.500\nHe'll be here\n\n01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500\nYeah, I examine the statues\n\n01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.500\nOkay, so you examine the statues\n\n01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.500\nThey're beginning to fall apart\n\n01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.500\nThere's several cracks, and you can see\n\n01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.500\nThe faces are worn off\n\n01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.500\nDo you want to enter the room?\n\n01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500\nYes, I enter the room\n\n01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.500\nYou enter the room\n\n01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.500\nHey, your pee kind of like rubbed off\n\n01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.500\nThe dick on his face, do you want to redraw it?\n\n01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.500\nI go back in and I re-ink the dick and balls on his forehead\n\n01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.500\nBecause that's going to be hilarious\n\n01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.500\nWould one of my sleep arrows do the opposite?\n\n01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.500\nLike riddle in or something?\n\n01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.500\nYou don't know\n\n01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.500\nWe should shoot him with it just to be safe\n\n01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.500\nWait, you're going to shoot him with arrows?\n\n01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.500\nWith a sleep arrow\n\n01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.500\nLike a light switch\n\n01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.500\nI do my best to murmur things in my sleep\n\n01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:47.500\nTo make it clear I was bullied as a child\n\n01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.500\nAnd or molested\n\n01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.500\nNot another bath, mom\n\n01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:57.500\nI'm already clean\n\n01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.500\nYou guys hear this and feel bad for your pranks\n\n01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.500\nHow clean can you get?\n\n01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.500\nI put on...\n\n01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:06.500\nI feel dirtier after you clean me\n\n01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:10.500\nCan I put on my hat of disguise and become Dan's mother?\n\n01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.500\nOkay\n\n01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.500\nOkay, it was bound to happen\n\n01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.500\nThat's technically something that can happen, yes\n\n01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.500\nI'm just saying maybe it would wake him\n\n01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.500\nAlright, did I do it?\n\n01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.500\nYeah, well your disguise is what you think she looks like\n\n01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:29.500\nYou don't actually know for sure\n\n01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:36.500\nThat's just sharpie without a beard\n\n01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.500\nWhat happened when you examined the statues?\n\n01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.500\nI went back in to redraw the dick and balls\n\n01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.500\nBut now I go back in while this is happening\n\n01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.500\nSlightly creeped out by a woman in love with a man\n\n01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.500\nPretending to be his mother while he's asleep\n\n01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.500\nHe's not creeped out enough to not pee on him\n\n01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:01.500\nNo, okay, I go into the room to look at the statues while that goes on\n\n01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.500\nOkay, there's three statues\n\n01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:07.500\nA couple seem cowed in admiration or maybe subservience\n\n01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.500\nThe one is larger than the other two\n\n01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.500\nArms are stretched out in triumph\n\n01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:16.500\nYou can see words scrawled on the base of the statue\n\n01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.500\nBut you can't really read their language\n\n01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.500\nI can read that language, right?\n\n01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.500\nI mean, you don't know\n\n01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.500\nYou haven't seen the right...\n\n01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.500\nThere's some writing you might like\n\n01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:30.500\nOh, hey, I'm a writer, you know\n\n01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.500\nI attempt to read the writing\n\n01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.500\nIt says Mershalk\n\n01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.500\nIt says Mershalk\n\n01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.500\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.500\nYou realize that it's part of the history of this plane\n\n01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:48.500\nMershalk is an ancient and dark god worshipped by the Yuan-ti\n\n01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.500\nWe're fucked\n\n01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.500\nI kneel down next to Sharpie\n\n01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.500\nOh, hi\n\n01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.500\nI have a clean, I'm clean\n\n01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:07.500\nBecoming his oppressor is not going to help the situation\n\n01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.500\nI'm going to undo it\n\n01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500\nYeah, fix it\n\n01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.500\nOh, hey, good job in that bath in there\n\n01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.500\nGood job\n\n01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:22.500\nI like, like, praising someone after they've been molested\n\n01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.500\nTook it like a champ\n\n01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:29.500\nHave you done this before?\n\n01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:33.500\nI just wanted to let you know that what happened in there\n\n01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.500\ndoesn't make me love you any more or less\n\n01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.500\nI just want to promise it's not going to happen again\n\n01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:43.500\nI just want to impress you with my spells\n\n01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.500\nOh, I know\n\n01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.500\nYou know what? I exist in every enemy that you encounter\n\n01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.500\nAny hole that's too dark\n\n01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:00.500\nI love my enemies, I hate myself\n\n01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500\nOh, no, no, no, no\n\n01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.500\nI want you to compartmentalize me, okay?\n\n01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.500\nCompartmentalize all humanity\n\n01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.500\nCompartmentalize everyone\n\n01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.500\nI'm letting you go\n\n01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.500\nI have no more feelings\n\n01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.500\nNo, hey, not to butt in\n\n01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.500\nI don't think this is working\n\n01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500\nBut keep trying\n\n01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:28.500\nOkay, I don't think you should be so turned on right now\n\n01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.500\nTouch it\n\n01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.500\nOkay, no\n\n01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.500\nI awkwardly walk over to where he is\n\n01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.500\nIt's dirty\n\n01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.500\nClean it\n\n01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:48.500\nIt'll always be dirty\n\n01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.500\nClean it\n\n01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.500\nYou know, any positive feelings that you have about me\n\n01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.500\nI want you to transfer them to Mulraine\n\n01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.500\nAnd any negative feelings\n\n01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:04.500\nI want you to imagine them going into a dark devil's box\n\n01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.500\nMulraine's devil's box\n\n01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.500\nClean my penis\n\n01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:12.500\nNot a vagina, just an actual box\n\n01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.500\nAnd imagine it being set on fire\n\n01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.500\nAnd then being eaten by a monster\n\n01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.500\nAnd it goes away forever\n\n01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:24.500\nWomen clean my penis, vaginas are on fire\n\n01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.500\nNo, okay\n\n01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.500\nI take the hat off\n\n01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.500\nHey, how did that go?\n\n01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:37.500\nWe'll find out when he wakes up\n\n01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.500\nI made some big mistakes, you guys\n\n01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.500\nI thought I understood Sharpie\n\n01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:43.500\nI don't think I do\n\n01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.500\nI'm very sorry\n\n01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.500\nNo one understands Sharpie\n\n01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.500\nHe's a mysterious fellow\n\n01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.500\nHe wants to help\n\n01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.500\nBut for all of his gifts\n\n01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:59.500\nThere's a deep pain that he masks\n\n01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.500\nI've tried to clean that penis so many times\n\n01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.500\nEvery time he falls asleep\n\n01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.500\nWhen he has one of those dreams\n\n01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.500\nI'll clean it, I'll do it\n\n01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.500\nAnd I'm constantly jerking him off while he sleeps\n\n01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.500\nNever seems to get him\n\n01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.500\nIt just makes it worse\n\n01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.500\nNever clean\n\n01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.500\nOkay, I'll be right over\n\n01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.500\nMaybe I should try it\n\n01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:24.500\nI've never cleaned this penis\n\n01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:28.500\nCan I give Chris my hat of disguise\n\n01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.500\nSo he can become Dan's mother?\n\n01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.500\nMaybe she should try a different disguise\n\n01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.500\nNo, I think this is what's going on\n\n01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.500\nI give Chris my hat of disguise\n\n01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.500\nOh, hey, I'm back\n\n01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:45.500\nNever seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight\n\n01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:49.500\nI've never seen you shining so bright\n\n01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.500\nYou're amazing\n\n01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500\nI don't look dirty\n\n01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:57.500\nUh, hey, I don't want to do this\n\n01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.500\nI feel like I need a shower\n\n01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.500\nI grab whoever's near me in my dream\n\n01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.500\nAnd hold them tight\n\n01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:14.500\nUh, oh fuck\n\n01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.500\nUh, Chris, run!\n\n01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:21.500\nHey dude, uh, uh, uh\n\n01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:25.500\nI stab his arm\n\n01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.500\nDo we need to roll a die?\n\n01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500\nWith a knife?\n\n01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.500\nWell, but just very lightly\n\n01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:34.500\nYeah, no, he's asleep, so it's not a task to hit him\n\n01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:35.500\nSo I hit him\n\n01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.500\nYeah, you strike him, I'm sorry, you strike him\n\n01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:40.500\nWell, I'll just, yeah, but not to hurt him\n\n01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.500\nYeah, okay, great\n\n01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.500\nYou do four non-legal damage\n\n01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.500\nUh, uh, uh, that means you love me\n\n01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.500\nYou wake up\n\n01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:51.500\nNow you're awake\n\n01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.500\nOh, hey!\n\n01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.500\nDid you have any weird dreams or anything?\n\n01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.500\nYeah, the usual\n\n01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.500\nOkay\n\n01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.500\nYou want to go out, maybe just go freshen up\n\n01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500\nDo you want to take five?\n\n01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.500\nThere's a room with a mirror in there\n\n01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.500\nYou guys didn't\n\n01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.500\nNo, we'll do it\n\n01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.500\nUh, you assholes\n\n01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.500\nI go and look in a reflective pool\n\n01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.500\nYou have like swastikas and dicks\n\n01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:21.500\nThat swastikas made of dicks\n\n01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.500\nYou're in a right state\n\n01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.500\nI'm going to keep these here forever\n\n01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.500\nThat's the way, own it\n\n01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.500\nI want you to feel bad next time I'm saving your life\n\n01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:34.500\nYou could be a guy with dicks on his face\n\n01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.500\nThat you drew\n\n01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.500\nThey come off\n\n01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:42.500\nNo, I'm making them permanent with a magic spell\n\n01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.500\nWith like a magic marker?\n\n01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.500\nYeah\n\n01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.500\nMaybe a Sharpie?\n\n01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.500\nI'm going to make them magical through a special ritual\n\n01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.500\nCalled not bathing\n\n01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.500\nUm, can we, so we looked at the statues\n\n01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.500\nAnd it says that in the stairs that go upstairs, right?\n\n01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.500\nYeah, yeah, but they have a giant crack in them\n\n01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.500\nSo we can't jump over the crack?\n\n01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.500\nWell, I mean, you have rope I guess\n\n01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:10.500\nSo you could probably\n\n01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.500\nShould we go up or we, I have rope\n\n01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.500\nOkay, let's try it\n\n01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.500\nHow about this, I'll hold the rope\n\n01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.500\nI'll fasten the rope, I take the rope\n\n01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.500\nWe tie one end to Chris de Burgh\n\n01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.500\nAnd I tie it around me\n\n01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.500\nAnd also fasten it to one of the statues\n\n01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.500\nThe cowering one to the side\n\n01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.500\nAnd as an anchor point for the rope\n\n01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:30.500\nSo we can walk up\n\n01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.500\nIf anything bad happens Chris de Burgh\n\n01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:33.500\nI'll reel you back in\n\n01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:34.500\nAs you tie the ropes\n\n01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.500\nYou feel a chill cove over the room\n\n01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.500\nAnd you feel an odd presence\n\n01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.500\nYou can hear a voice\n\n01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.500\nOh, sorry, do you want to go?\n\n01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.500\nGo ahead\n\n01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:44.500\nSorry, but no, it's fine, it's fine\n\n01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.500\nYou hear a voice echoing through the chamber\n\n01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:51.500\nWhat new morsels have been tossed into my cell?\n\n01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.500\nYou hear thudding footfalls\n\n01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.500\nAnd the clinking of metal rumbling against metal\n\n01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.500\nIs that the guy from the pepperage farm commercials?\n\n01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500\nPepperage farm?\n\n01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.500\nLuckily you're covered in piss\n\n01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.500\nThat's true\n\n01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.500\nOut of the crack in the staircase\n\n01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.500\nprotrudes a draconic head\n\n01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.500\nfollowed by a large green form\n\n01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.500\nthat you know all too well\n\n01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.500\nA dragon\n\n01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.500\nIts toothy jaw opens in anticipation\n\n01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.500\nand bright green globs of saliva\n\n01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:21.500\ntripped onto the floor\n\n01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.500\nsizzling and bubbling on impact\n\n01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.500\nIts temples are crowned with a frilled hood\n\n01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:26.500\nthat extends like a cobra's\n\n01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.500\nlaterally down the body\n\n01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.500\nAn odor of chlorine clings to its scaly hide\n\n01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.500\nand glimmers with an emerald sheen\n\n01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500\nAround its neck you can see an iron collar\n\n01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.500\nand a few long chains\n\n01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.500\ndangling around as the beast moves\n\n01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.500\nHey, how about you try going up first?\n\n01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.500\nWell, yeah, he already came out\n\n01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.500\nI'd say get back here and let's regroup\n\n01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.500\nfor a concerted attack here\n\n01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.500\nIs he

manage to grab your knife\n\n01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.500\nHe repents\n\n01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.500\nIs it possible?\n\n01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.500\nI don't know dragons all that well\n\n01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.500\nIs it possible that he's being chained there\n\n01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.500\nAnd he's been imprisoned by something?\n\n01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:08.500\nBut what

01:26:43.500\nSome potions and some paralyzers\n\n01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:44.500\nOkay\n\n01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.500\nThose were syringes\n\n01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:49.500\nFull of presumably paralyzing fluid\n\n01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:50.500\nOkay\n\n01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:55.500\nDo they come in ready injectable syringes?\n\n01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.500\nThey come in large syringes,

that, right?\n\n01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:06.500\nI give one to Christopher because he's\n\n01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.500\nHe has skills that will enable him\n\n01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.500\nTo get in close to this thing that I don't have\n\n01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.500\nYeah, I can sneak\n\n01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.500\nGo stab this thing\n\n01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.500\nCool\n\n01:27:14.500

paralyzer injection\n\n01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.500\nSo you hand him the paralyzer and you\n\n01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.500\nAttempt to sneak\n\n01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.500\nOh, hey, that's a good

now\n\n01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:37.500\nAnd attempts to attack him with a few of his limbs\n\n01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.500\nThis could be dangerous, you guys\n\n01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.500\nArtificial tension\n\n01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.500\nThat's a great filmmaking device\n\n01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:48.500\nThe director should just come on and be like\n\n01:27:48.500 -->

01:28:00.500\nAnd he manages to not hit you with those\n\n01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.500\nI mean, he doesn't manage to hit you with those\n\n01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.500\nBut then he nips at you with his powerful beak\n\n01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.500\nHe bites you right in the hand\n\n01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.500\nNot your dagger hand, of course\n\n01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.500\nWell, not, of course\n\n01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.500\nI mean, that's a reasonable thing that could happen\n\n01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.500\nDealing seven damage\n\n01:28:18.500 -->

01:33:18.500\nAnd you could summon another scorpion if you wanted\n\n01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:23.500\nSummon a second scorpion, I'm hoping that capitalism will emerge\n\n01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.500\nAnd you send him to attack presumably?\n\n01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:26.500\nYes, of course\n\n01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:27.500\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:33:27.500 -->

01:33:39.500\nBecause David critically strikes the dragon in the side of the head\n\n01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:40.500\nThat's true\n\n01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.500\nI am with the... sorry\n\n01:33:42.500

01:33:54.500\nKeith looks dejected\n\n01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.500\nI have a red cap poison\n\n01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.500\nCan I stab the dragon with it?\n\n01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:02.500\nYeah, so that's one of the poisons in your dagger\n\n01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.500\nShould I do that?\n\n01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.500\nOkay, stab him\n\n01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:10.500\nYou see the dragon seems a bit less lucid\n\n01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.500\nA bit loopy if you will\n\n01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:14.500\nYou stab him\n\n01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:17.500\nYour dagger manages to pierce its hide\n\n01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.500\nBut only just a little\n\n01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:22.500\nIt doesn't seem to have any effect\n\n01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.500\nYou might want to...\n\n01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.500\nYou guys won't end it here\n\n01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.500\nIt's going to take a while\n\n01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.500\nIf you want\n\n01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.500\nHow many...\n\n01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.500\nI'm just saying\n\n01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:37.500\nAre we allowed to know how many power pellets?\n\n01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.500\nEnergy, what's his energy bar?\n\n01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:40.500\nHealth bar\n\n01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.500\nIs this dragon half dead?\n\n01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.500\nYeah, he's about half dead\n\n01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:44.500\nOkay\n\n01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.500\nHalf dead cliffhanger!\n\n01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.500\nHalf dead dragon!\n\n01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.500\nThank you

01:35:08.500\nHalf dead dragon\n\n01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:10.500\nI was kind of a half dead dragon tonight\n\n01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.500\nWith my congestion and my inability\n\n01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.500\nTo put thoughts together\n\n01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.500\nAre you going to go drinking afterwards?\n\n01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:17.500\nI don't know\n\n01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.500\nWhy stop now?\n\n01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:22.500\nI feel like alcohol kills germs\n\n01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.500\nThat's what they used to tell us\n\n01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.500\nWhen we first started drinking\n\n01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.500\nWhen we were 13\n\n01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:32.500\nIf you had to share a glass at a party\n\n01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:35.500\nAlcohol kills all germs, bro\n\n01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.500\nThat's what I heard\n\n01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.500\nI never bothered to look into it\n\n01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.500\nSigh\n\n01:35:45.500 -->

much expectation\n\n01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.500\nYou deserve it now\n\n01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:16.500\nIt's easy\n\n01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:17.500\nYou proved that you could do it\n\n01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.500\nNow it's all the apples are going to fall off\n\n01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.500\nToo much thought about me\n\n01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.500\nAnd what I am\n\n01:37:23.500 -->

place\n\n01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:34.500\nWhere the universe moves through you?\n\n01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:35.500\nYou get destroyed\n\n01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.500\nYou don't get handed a bunch of money\n\n01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.500\nBy people\n\n01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:42.500\nYou end up back in the gutter\n\n01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:43.500\nYou hit rock bottom\n\n01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:44.500\nYou become human again\n\n01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:46.500\nAre you semi-consciously sending yourself\n\n01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.500\nBack to the gutter by doing this?\n\n01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.500\nIs this self-annihilation\n\n01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:50.500\nTo kind of achieve that?\n\n01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:51.500\nProbably\n\n01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.500\nMom\n\n01:37:52.500 -->
