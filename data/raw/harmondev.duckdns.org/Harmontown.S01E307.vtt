00:00.000 --> 00:12.800
Where am I? Where am I? Oh my god, I'm at Harmon's Town, ladies and gentlemen. I hope you

00:12.800 --> 00:19.920
are too. How lucky are all of us. Make some noise. So good to see you.

00:19.920 --> 00:36.000
Please welcome to the stage, the most wonderful, the incomparable Spencer Critt.

00:36.000 --> 00:47.180
Yeah! The man of the moment. King, rule, shocker, maker, breaker. You know him at

00:47.180 --> 00:54.160
Den Harmon. Let's call him Den Harmon, the mayor of Harmontown, Den Harmon.

00:58.160 --> 01:13.360
Thank you. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. I want to thank you. I want to thank you.

01:13.360 --> 01:25.720
You've been so good to me. I want to have gratitude. When I was just a little boy, I couldn't thank

01:25.720 --> 01:35.420
anyone for a toy. So my rhymes were weak. But then my mom took a peek down my diaper,

01:35.420 --> 01:57.640
and she saw, damn, a Sherman tank, incest, damn. Okay.

01:57.640 --> 02:13.600
Thanks. It's it's it's knowing when to take the art away. As Donald Sutherland says at six

02:13.600 --> 02:24.240
degrees of separation. I got, I got one of those zits right in the crease of my nose.

02:24.240 --> 02:34.200
No. What is skin thinking? Like what? How hard? I know. I already know the answer. I know the

02:34.200 --> 02:41.880
answer. There's no God is the answer. It was what we have. We arrived at over billions of years

02:41.880 --> 02:48.400
of improv. Like it, otherwise someone would say, you know, I think I can figure out a better way

02:48.400 --> 02:54.800
to coat a gingerbread man in like latex, you know, like, and like, we wouldn't have to have

02:54.800 --> 03:04.560
fucking like, systems of sebum and like, like, like ingrown for epiduemuses. Like, it's insane.

03:04.560 --> 03:10.680
And all topped off with, you know, there's a, there's the most important part of your skin.

03:10.680 --> 03:18.240
The fact that it's covered completely covered every square centimeter of it in microscopic

03:18.240 --> 03:26.000
flora. And not a little fauna. And because if it weren't there, then there's all these things in

03:26.000 --> 03:30.320
the air that would land and they would go like, I'm gonna set up shop here. You are protected

03:30.320 --> 03:37.520
every minute of every day by the fact that you are infested by beasties that live in harmony with

03:37.520 --> 03:44.160
you. Life is a prison. It's a prison cell. There's a lot of people in the cell with us. Yeah,

03:44.160 --> 03:57.600
you're, you're, you're alive because you're a bitch. You traded your integrity to see another day

03:57.600 --> 04:10.480
behind bars. You could have gone out a man. I know I sound like I'm quoting a movie or something.

04:10.480 --> 04:17.760
I got a movie about a guy who goes to prison and has to choose between dying brave and living

04:17.760 --> 04:26.480
cowardly. Okay. It was really professorial. Yeah. I got a, I got a, I got a new phone case. It's real

04:26.480 --> 04:33.680
big. Okay. It's got what, what made it just a magnet instead of the thing. It's just a magnet.

04:34.320 --> 04:38.800
What, what made you replace it? I'm just, I got a new phone and I, you know,

04:38.800 --> 04:42.480
I was going to get the new case for the new phone, you know, because it's different size.

04:42.480 --> 04:52.240
Does that one take those 3D pictures? Yeah, the an emojis. No, no. I've been seeing on Facebook,

04:52.240 --> 04:57.680
there's these 3D photos of dogs. So you'll be scrolling through Facebook and then there'll be

04:57.680 --> 05:06.800
this 3D dogs staring right at you in 3D. No, no. And it's like, well, photos aren't in 3D. This is

05:06.800 --> 05:13.680
crazy. And it's just this big old dog staring right at you. Like coming out of the screen.

05:13.680 --> 05:20.080
Oh, coming right out. Yeah, it's weird. You don't, because it doesn't look like it'll work, but like

05:20.080 --> 05:26.160
the parallax of the screen and the photo movement as you scroll through it, it has this weird,

05:26.160 --> 05:31.600
you know, 3D effect to it. But I thought it was some iPhone thing and maybe it's not.

05:31.600 --> 05:39.040
Hmm. I wouldn't know. Yeah, I'm not plugged in. Me neither. I used to know all, I used to work

05:39.040 --> 05:48.160
at Apple. I used to know all the Apple stuff. Now it's like just sad. Whenever I show people my,

05:48.160 --> 05:52.960
my, my phone case, they, they go, oh, it's like a wallet, you got your credit cards in there and

05:52.960 --> 05:58.560
stuff. I go, yeah, I do. Cash and all that stuff. And then they always, every single person, they

05:58.560 --> 06:07.280
always want to like, this is just like some weird human instinct. They go, so you should, you know,

06:07.280 --> 06:11.840
don't, don't you think that's a little dangerous? Because now if you lose one thing, you lose everything.

06:12.480 --> 06:16.800
And I go, well, you just, just think about what your brain is doing right now. Like,

06:17.840 --> 06:23.360
like you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're holding

06:23.360 --> 06:32.640
vigil over a, a, a society, an ideal society where we aerosol our property to, to the extent that

06:32.640 --> 06:37.200
all of it's expendable. What are you talking about? Everyone's got like four things in their

06:37.200 --> 06:43.760
pocket. Yeah. If you lose any of them, you're fucked. Nobody wants to lose any of them. You

06:43.760 --> 06:49.600
don't want to lose your keys, your phone or your wallet. So why the fuck? Yeah, no shit. If I lose

06:49.600 --> 06:54.880
one thing, I'm fucked. Why would you, it's, it's, what is that instinct that we have? Like, oh,

06:54.880 --> 06:59.760
yeah, if you think about it, you're kind of fucked. Yeah. No, I'm not. I'm no more fucked than you.

06:59.760 --> 07:04.480
I have one thing to remember and one thing that fucks me and you have four things to remember

07:04.480 --> 07:10.480
and each one fucks you a quarter. Like, who cares? Well, what is this quibbling? You're, you're,

07:10.480 --> 07:14.720
you're a nonsense person. You should be ashamed of yourself. Here's, here's something that you,

07:14.720 --> 07:21.200
you lost a long time ago. You're shame. Yeah. Let me get you a big case for that so that when

07:21.200 --> 07:27.840
you lose it, you know, you should have put a hubcap on that shit. It's been gone since the 70s.

07:33.360 --> 07:38.320
I would, I would buy a shame case. I don't need no shame case.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.360
Also, if that were true, you'd be like, you wouldn't put shit in your house because people would

07:43.360 --> 07:48.160
say the same shit to you. Like, now all the shit's in your house. Well, how about your fucking skull?

07:48.160 --> 07:55.760
Who, what do you cut your whole brain in one skull? What do you tie? Oh, just the two eyeballs then.

07:55.760 --> 08:03.920
So, uh, both necessary for depth perception. Yeah, I done one pancreas. What are the, whoa, who,

08:05.440 --> 08:10.400
who are you? Are you an ant? Is it, are you an insect person here to like, like, like,

08:10.400 --> 08:19.280
you're like, not very modular, are you? Your identity isn't, isn't sprayed in a wide enough

08:19.280 --> 08:25.760
cone for me to give you a license to be safe. Well, I don't like about that critique is that

08:25.760 --> 08:30.880
it fundamentally relies on someone essentially explaining to you what it means for things to

08:30.880 --> 08:38.560
be grouped together. It's like, yeah, no, those things are together. That's a good point. The

08:38.560 --> 08:45.760
same way as if I'm wearing a watch and my arm gets cut off, I'd have lost my watch because those

08:45.760 --> 08:54.960
things are together. Or if my head was cut off, my glasses, they'd also be off my body because

08:54.960 --> 09:03.440
these things are together. My head hair would also be off my body being with the thing that was

09:03.440 --> 09:09.600
removed from, because they're together. That's what that means. So I mean, on the one hand,

09:09.600 --> 09:14.240
it's bullying you, but on the other hand, it's like, Hey, what do you think it means when stuff is

09:14.240 --> 09:20.480
associated with other stuff? Let me break this thing down to you. Yeah, that's what it really is.

09:21.280 --> 09:26.400
That's being like, that's being like, empathic and going like, well, what's really happening in

09:26.400 --> 09:30.480
their brain? They're, they're trying to connect. Right. They're like, I know what things are when

09:30.480 --> 09:35.280
they're next to each other. They're next to each other. Right. Right. They're just saying something.

09:35.280 --> 09:40.880
Right. That's this and it doesn't make me less pissed, but I think I'm growing because instead

09:40.880 --> 09:45.600
of just getting pissed, I'm getting pissed and having the thought, which is anytime someone says

09:45.600 --> 09:50.080
something that pisses me off, it's just they had a thought and they were like, Oh, I want to share

09:50.080 --> 09:54.320
this thought. And they did it. And they didn't think about the ramifications of that action and

09:54.320 --> 09:59.040
how much it would piss me off. But they were just so excited that they said whatever dumb

09:59.040 --> 10:03.600
fucking shit that they did before passing it through a filter. And I'm still fucking pissed,

10:03.600 --> 10:13.760
but recognizing that feels like growth. I don't know. And that wasn't that's just free association.

10:13.760 --> 10:18.320
That wasn't me trying to apply my situation to yours. I'm not trying to be mad at those people.

10:18.320 --> 10:24.800
Don't get me wrong. Okay. That last part was a setback. But yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I was just in a

10:24.800 --> 10:31.760
trance. I mean, and then, and then, you know, I think you and I could both say then also,

10:33.360 --> 10:38.640
well, it's these, this other person who maybe they maybe they're just they're,

10:39.600 --> 10:45.200
they're their little Honda generator. It runs runs a little faster. It's got what it's got less

10:45.200 --> 10:50.480
CCs. I don't I don't know what like what the metaphor would be like, because it doesn't do

10:50.480 --> 10:56.960
us any good to be because the reason we're mad. Okay, let me start over. The reason we're mad when

10:56.960 --> 11:07.680
it happens is because it's not fair because we feel anguish and anxiety and shame. Right? Sure.

11:07.680 --> 11:11.040
Isn't that isn't that why you get mad when someone cuts you off on the freeway? Really,

11:11.040 --> 11:16.880
it's not it's not like I mean, some if they if they almost kill you, like, like, like, there's

11:16.880 --> 11:22.240
adrenaline and there's holy shit. If anything, usually when it's a really close call, you actually

11:22.240 --> 11:28.160
kind of feel a sense of elation and don't remember the other person exists until a couple seconds

11:28.160 --> 11:36.000
later. But it's like the thing that pushes you off about the lack of consideration in it's always

11:36.000 --> 11:42.800
it doesn't it doesn't the root of that hair. It's not fair because I put myself through so much

11:42.800 --> 11:49.600
in order to not be that person. And that person isn't even doing it. And I yeah, to me, I mean,

11:49.600 --> 11:55.440
it sounds like the same feeling. But to me, it's like, how dare you even assume I haven't put that

11:55.440 --> 12:00.160
work in. I'm putting all the fucking work in you put the work in and realize I put the work in and

12:00.160 --> 12:05.200
shut the fuck up. Because it's like, I'm trying over here. What are you doing yelling at me for

12:05.200 --> 12:11.920
you think I'm not trying your fucking blind? Shut up. Not like blind blind. You can't see yeah,

12:11.920 --> 12:17.680
whatever. I'm it's good. I live with it. How are you guys doing?

12:24.800 --> 12:31.360
I guess there is a it's you get it's it's you're mad because they're they're insulting you.

12:31.360 --> 12:37.120
Right. To me, it just feels like yeah, I'm smart. I know this stuff. Are you like it just feels like

12:37.120 --> 12:41.440
they're trying to like pretend I don't know this stuff. That's like, yeah, no fucking shit.

12:41.440 --> 12:50.560
Things are next to each other. But and maybe maybe I'm just kind of maybe are we supposed to then

12:50.560 --> 12:58.800
like because I'm sure when we're talking, I'm sure constantly you say something and then I say

12:58.800 --> 13:05.360
something back that you knew I was going to say and that I and that and that I knew that you knew

13:05.360 --> 13:11.920
already. But that's like we're just like hitting the thing. But there's categories of doing that

13:11.920 --> 13:20.640
that piss us off. Like I think like two zebra scientists can probably make small talk and go

13:20.640 --> 13:25.920
like, Oh, there's a new zebra in the paddock. And then and then the other one says like,

13:26.720 --> 13:31.840
hope this one doesn't get herpes. Like because the zebras keep getting herpes in the paddock.

13:31.840 --> 13:40.400
You're not supposed to know I'm filling this in as we go. It's a nonlinear it's a it's a showtime

13:40.400 --> 13:50.240
original this show. The but but but kind of the guy the zebra expert wanted him to say that because

13:50.240 --> 13:56.080
he's he didn't want to have to say there's a new zebra in the paddock and now I'd like to talk about

13:56.080 --> 14:01.200
the last one getting herpes like he doesn't want that burden he wants to be able to actually just

14:01.200 --> 14:07.760
like bump the shuttlecock up near the net. Right. We have this agreement that we're going to talk

14:07.760 --> 14:12.560
about things that two people would talk about mutually not not anything in the history that

14:12.560 --> 14:17.920
we can't relate on not any future dreams that we we can't really jump in on we we as people have

14:17.920 --> 14:22.480
this contract where we're like, we're friends because you know when to change the subject.

14:23.200 --> 14:29.200
Right. The timing. Yeah. And the person that you don't like is a person who doesn't know when

14:29.200 --> 14:33.760
to change the subject. That's like the most basic part of friendship is like we're friends with

14:33.760 --> 14:37.440
the kid that your friends with some from six years old on because every time you brought up paste

14:37.440 --> 14:43.200
that motherfucker was like you should see paste or that motherfucker was like I don't like paste and

14:43.200 --> 14:48.240
you're like yeah fuck paste like that's the contract so we get really frustrated with people

14:48.240 --> 14:53.120
when it looks like they're trying to slime us or cheat on the fucking contract and not putting a

14:53.120 --> 14:57.680
lot of thought into what you're going to say it's cheating on the contract and we try to do that

14:57.680 --> 15:02.320
shit right so we get pissed we get insecure we're like wait a second am i being fucked am i being

15:02.320 --> 15:11.760
fucked i'm being fucked right you knew god damn well you were supposed to bring up the green

15:11.760 --> 15:19.200
baby packers right i said man i sure do love wisconsin and you looked at me talking about

15:19.200 --> 15:29.680
pasta's delicious sometimes that's called an emotional bid right yes that was like the first

15:29.680 --> 15:35.200
thing i learned in couples therapy emotional bids which actually i have to say i hope Cody doesn't

15:35.200 --> 15:39.360
listen to this because i have to cop to the fact that lately well she understands i i apologize

15:39.360 --> 15:45.040
to her today i've been buried in my laptop like i'm kind of hiding from some shit and uh like

15:45.040 --> 15:50.240
i'm hiding from shit next to her and i'm using my laptop and we love each other and stuff but

15:50.240 --> 15:55.040
nevertheless i have been i'm looking at the last week and i have not been matching emotional bids

15:55.040 --> 16:01.600
emotional bids are just just anything it's the pixel of relationship communication uh you know

16:01.600 --> 16:08.480
we've i that was that was the first thing because it was like oh if someone says look look out the

16:08.480 --> 16:16.160
window at the st louis arch while you're driving past the st louis arch oh god you you i i i i hate

16:16.160 --> 16:22.080
it don't make me look at stuff i hate i'm talking like like like every time someone makes me look

16:22.080 --> 16:28.640
at something i there's a transaction happening and i'm like i'm like it's all kinds of fucking

16:28.640 --> 16:36.160
horrible shit circuit boards that were designed to be mounted in defense satellites in an era

16:36.160 --> 16:43.520
that is bygone this equipment is not needed anymore it is only hurtful and but it's like

16:43.520 --> 16:48.720
the numbers i'm crunching when it's like hey look at this thing on my phone like and i just like

16:48.720 --> 16:52.480
like one little part of my brain going like you just made me look at something oh that's cool

16:56.720 --> 17:03.040
no no you fucking cop i'm sorry but but you're not supposed to think it's like it's an emotional

17:03.040 --> 17:08.400
bit if it's even if it seems futile somebody's saying like it's like small talky stuff for

17:08.400 --> 17:12.880
whatever this oh look at that look at this look at that it's somebody checking in

17:13.760 --> 17:20.080
and saying are you with me like what's more redundant than holding hands it's already a hand

17:20.080 --> 17:26.560
like what if anything you're if anything you're you're taking two hands off the grid

17:26.560 --> 17:33.440
but you're actually you're actually downgrading half of each of your hand supply

17:35.120 --> 17:42.640
it's certainly not practical it's definitely not edifying it's it doesn't like teach you

17:42.640 --> 17:50.000
new things about your hand um uh and yet we definitely do it and we do it 85 year old people

17:50.000 --> 17:58.640

i'm i'm so invested in this honestly i don't know carl

26:24.160 --> 26:27.680
you know there's a there's a contemporary thought that has it that the question itself

26:27.680 --> 26:33.920
proves it proves its own answer what the fuck are you talking about have you been hanging out with

26:33.920 --> 26:43.520
zander again holy shit no zanders into crystals not simulation theory

27:26.400 --> 27:27.440
fifth time this week

27:27.440 --> 27:38.640

27:43.520 --> 27:48.720
guest tonight by the way and Rob Schrab isn't here nothing nothing nothing nothing good is about to

27:48.720 --> 28:02.000
happen i didn't i didn't one man five characters three three of them are confused i do i did write

28:02.000 --> 28:06.480
down one thing but i i assume if i've been talking about this and all of the comedic permutations

28:06.480 --> 28:11.440
have already been explored but the weird thing is i'm off twitter now so i never know i hear random

28:11.440 --> 28:16.880
things i feel like one thing a week like i'm 80 years old like i know one news item a week or one

28:16.880 --> 28:23.760
or one like just human interest piece and uh it it it it and i can't tell the difference between

28:23.760 --> 28:27.360
the ones that are so played out and everyone's talking about them whatever oh because dan

28:27.360 --> 28:30.400
before when you were on twitter you were you you really had your finger on the pulse and

28:31.280 --> 28:36.640
we were calling you the dick dick clark of our generation um all right well i don't i don't

28:36.640 --> 28:44.000
know who you are you sound exactly like me so let's not have a conversation why not we'll see

28:44.000 --> 28:49.440
that's my problem is that i i said let's not have a conversation i don't even know which of us said

28:49.440 --> 29:00.000
that it was me who said that this is exactly my point you and i are talking to each other right

29:00.000 --> 29:14.560
now and no one can tell exactly it just sounds like one guy talking because we have the same voice

29:18.400 --> 29:26.960
Dan Harmon meets Dan Harmon and Dan Harmon the two uh so i heard one sniglet one little thing

29:26.960 --> 29:34.800
just random shit i hear there's a tinder or the company that owns tinder the they don't want

29:34.800 --> 29:42.720
all the tenders the hydra of all the dating swipies um they were gonna they were gonna or

29:42.720 --> 29:49.360
they are i i they they were gonna start charging people over 40 like like yeah they've been extra

29:49.360 --> 29:52.880
is that was that a thing that everybody was like talking about yeah they've been doing that one

29:52.880 --> 29:57.120
like the idea that if you're over 40 you have to pay a little extra to be on the

29:58.320 --> 30:03.200
that's fair that's fair i just thought that was so amazing because it's such a perfect it's beyond

30:03.200 --> 30:07.840
logan's run all the way into just like because it's like obviously the natural inversion of that is

30:07.840 --> 30:14.000
like you know and if you're 25 obviously hey whoa it's on the house and then if you're 20 hey here's

30:14.000 --> 30:23.040
50 bucks and then you keep on going down all the way to the point where if you're pregnant your

30:23.040 --> 30:30.480
baby is worth $50,000 of credit on a social media site because it's so young you could like so you

30:30.480 --> 30:36.320
could sign a contract for it to like committing to one over the other and then like i just like

30:36.320 --> 30:42.160
the idea didn't pop a john as you get older then you pay if you're 90 years old you have to pay

30:42.160 --> 30:53.440
a million dollars a minute to be around people it kind of it makes perfect sense it seems hard to

30:53.440 --> 30:58.480
parody like i was trying to think of like how to like come up with something that was like beyond

30:58.480 --> 31:03.520
parody but seems reasonable but i feel like there could just be like an app that like pays people

31:03.520 --> 31:09.040
to eat bugs like you just take a picture of a cricket and they'll just give you like 30 cents

31:09.040 --> 31:14.560
and they'll be like yeah it's sustainable blockchain it's helping everybody and then

31:14.560 --> 31:22.000
it'll be good but i don't know can't you do that on fiverr yeah yeah but that's that's way you know

31:22.000 --> 31:27.600
that's a way more equitable than what i'm proposing what's what's fiverr fiverr's like uh you can

31:27.600 --> 31:33.280
pay somebody five bucks and above to do a task no you don't know also you can also the dollar store

31:33.280 --> 31:40.480
of task rabbits yeah that's i mean it's everything's a slippery slope what am i it's not everything

31:40.480 --> 31:45.920
we have a really slope is we're in the pit we're in a slippery pit whenever we have like a really

31:45.920 --> 31:54.400
bad show i pay a 68 year old man to shit on my chest and he pays me four dollars

31:54.400 --> 32:07.360
it's a wonderful world we've built yeah it is the very definition of blockchain

32:12.160 --> 32:18.160
you should you should have to pay more to be around people when you're over 40 you do you do

32:18.160 --> 32:21.920
you do pay more to be around people when you're over 40 yes that's what i meant you shouldn't

32:21.920 --> 32:28.160
have to that's not what i meant i meant i meant you do you you you should have to

32:29.360 --> 32:35.360
you you you every every interact every gesture you make uh costs you three more breaths than a

32:35.360 --> 32:42.800
teenager if you say i don't know that you you your heart had to work harder but also when you

32:42.800 --> 32:47.680
go to like new york city and you are you're you're walking through the city you see a bunch of like

32:47.680 --> 32:53.440
20 to 30 year olds in waitress and waiter uniforms or in bellhop uniforms and you realize that

32:53.440 --> 32:59.760
major cities are really people over 40 with money forcing 20 somethings to bust their ass

33:00.400 --> 33:05.120
and 20 somethings are like well there's six of us but we live in the middle of manhattan and we're

33:05.120 --> 33:09.920
living that new york life and we're all like struggling to do this shit which is unfair

33:09.920 --> 33:15.120
but then there's a bunch of like over 40 people like uh you love living in new york don't you

33:15.120 --> 33:19.200
yeah i suck the youth out of your lungs

33:22.800 --> 33:30.240
it's disgusting it's not like san diego oh my god that guy seriously that's the way we have

33:30.240 --> 33:34.880
currently in this economy not to get crazy dark but like in this economy you should have to

33:34.880 --> 33:40.320
fucking pay because you these kids are struggling out there like well that was that was that was

33:40.320 --> 33:45.280
i've always said that was the you know i had an ex-girlfriend who kind of woke me up to that

33:46.000 --> 33:52.000
that that's our industry hollywood whatever you call it without sounding like a douche um

33:52.800 --> 34:01.040
the biz the razzle dazzles uh um the business of show like it really it's a got a huge tradition

34:01.040 --> 34:07.440
of labor abuse and also at the same time the foot the thing that's ironic about it is not only labor

34:07.440 --> 34:16.080
abuse but then also on the flip side of it it it's you can't you the labor that gets abused

34:16.080 --> 34:22.560
has to have a support system yeah that whole thing like you can't be you can't just be born

34:22.560 --> 34:28.640
in dirt with no support system get on a bus and go i'm gonna go be an assistant and or whatever

34:28.640 --> 34:33.120
and you gotta be rich to get exploited your parents have to have your back a little bit which

34:33.120 --> 34:40.160
excludes an entire giant this whole thing and then we talk about where's the diversity on all

34:40.160 --> 34:44.800
this stuff but it's like at the very bottom where we where we crack the nuts the hardest where we

34:44.800 --> 34:50.720
make people shit in their cars and like want to kill themselves like it's all driven by this weird

34:50.720 --> 34:56.560
unspoken concept of yeah but this is where milk and honey flows baby like what do you what do you

34:56.560 --> 35:03.120
mean you don't want to like like be made to cry once in a while like like what do you hate you

35:03.120 --> 35:08.320
hate you hate you hate Spielberg or something what do you hate Jaws i thought that was a great movie

35:08.320 --> 35:15.200
right wait what i'm working on the Goldbergs what do you mean that that was right also i

35:15.200 --> 35:20.640
rift the name of a show with which i have no beef and no nobody lowered out so that it was a safe

35:20.640 --> 35:30.960
riff just in case i need to tag that riff fuck the goldbergs mad mad beef with jeff garland

35:31.680 --> 35:35.840
um and then they kick you out when you get old this is a rough ass business because they

35:35.840 --> 35:40.960
exploit you through your 20s and your 30s really and then in your 40s you're sort of in a position

35:40.960 --> 35:47.360
where you're like i'm billing you six thousand for that mother fucker and then as you get over 40

35:47.360 --> 35:58.400
they're like hope you got your money in your 40s because it gets yeah yeah i mean i you could you

35:58.400 --> 36:05.440
could writers love writing stories about our obsession with beauty and uh do we tell fairy tales

36:05.440 --> 36:10.640
and horror stories and cautionary tales about like oh you should have learned that beauty's only

36:10.640 --> 36:16.560
skin deep and all this stuff and oh if only i could be 50 and look 25 but and then there's this other

36:16.560 --> 36:23.600
thing though like if you're if you you could look 25 and factually be 50 and that would fuck you over

36:23.600 --> 36:31.440
as a screenwriter like like people just like if you've been around too long or someone knows that

36:31.440 --> 36:37.040
you were you're you're a certain age you're just you're just not like there's there was a big suit

36:37.040 --> 36:44.880
about that with the wga um and you know the way the suit went down you would think that we had

36:44.880 --> 36:51.840
that i i my memory of it even though i was not somebody that cared about it at the time i was

36:51.840 --> 37:02.320
very young full of cum and pennies and and typewriter ink was just spraying fucking cum and ink

37:02.320 --> 37:10.240
everywhere okay i i i can mix somebody somebody somebody somebody got up and i believe

37:10.240 --> 37:14.080
also the title of our four-part series

37:18.000 --> 37:24.160
so cheesy we rejoin our continuings four four our continuing series cum and ink the Dan Harmonn

37:24.160 --> 37:31.520
story after the war Winston Churchill called his boys home but Dan Harmonn had more coming and more

37:31.520 --> 37:40.080
typing to do changing his identity with a brothel owner that had his same height and dress size he

37:40.080 --> 37:45.280
began going through three typewriters and four orchard workers a day

37:48.480 --> 37:54.640
his insatiable appetite for carnal knowledge and pros sharing

37:57.520 --> 38:04.880
was seconded only by his need for more cum oh hello thank you what did you get here by bus

38:04.880 --> 38:10.800
that's my son everybody is uh i heard you cough father so i finished

38:12.400 --> 38:18.960
let me ask you a question son sure why do you talk so fast i'm just trying to be like you

38:20.080 --> 38:24.880
but don't you understand in the emulation of me you're starting to become a strange

38:26.160 --> 38:30.720
uncanny recreation no one talks the way you talk father i'm full of cum

38:30.720 --> 38:36.560
i'm full of it i'm full of it i'm full of it i'm full of it sold

38:39.200 --> 38:44.480
and when one is full of cum there's much to do many places to go have to say things quick

38:44.480 --> 38:46.000
so i can go and empty this dick

38:50.880 --> 38:58.000
really wow of all the things i've done in my career 1940s kid full of cum was my favorite

38:58.000 --> 39:05.760
your mother fuckers just negated a 20-year career of witty witty witty things he sometimes

39:05.760 --> 39:14.560
applause hurts doesn't it yeah yeah that's what i'm saying like never ever solicit it and

39:14.560 --> 39:22.240
most of the time when you get it feel bad it ruins everything i'm not saying you did not

39:22.240 --> 39:27.200
react organically but it is like anything less than i mean when are we ever on the same page

39:27.200 --> 39:35.280
about what deserves a round of applause never what is the likelihood of us agreeing like yes of

39:35.280 --> 39:40.160
course i would applaud there but usually applause means i think it's people going like

39:41.440 --> 39:45.520
like like i'm still with you i'm listening like change the subject

39:52.640 --> 39:56.400
they're like they're like switch gears like get off your get get off the bike and then get

39:56.400 --> 40:02.400
back on again because basically i'm you're not a fucking triathlete so i'm not here to be wowed by

40:02.400 --> 40:08.000
your bicycling i'm the only merit you have is the weird wiggles your butt does when you're

40:08.000 --> 40:14.320
getting on and off the bike so like it's just like like i just want to want you to go up another

40:14.320 --> 40:22.560
driveway so i think i think the applause means like like like like good now do now do now don't

44:12.800 --> 44:36.400
you gotta force her up you've been chosen based on the spangliness of your jacket it's

44:36.400 --> 44:47.840
there's there's an episode where jeff davis is like um if you if you were to suit a suit to

44:47.840 --> 44:58.800

45:17.120 --> 45:28.080
but you're a jeff davis fan um i'm i'm an everyone fan i live in rural japan and um

45:29.360 --> 45:35.040
yeah hey uh so we went for no geographic we went with just jacket sparkle sorry

45:37.040 --> 45:41.280
and and and we and we got someone from the other side of the earth this is from space

45:41.280 --> 45:49.840
um but uh i never got your name um i'm jimmy i actually i have he him pronouns but it's all

45:49.840 --> 45:53.200
good you have sparkles kind of wait what's the pronoun thinking i'm not gonna make a big deal

45:53.200 --> 46:00.640
out of it but i didn't hear you he oh you're like oh he okay well that's easy okay Jesus somebody

46:00.640 --> 46:06.640
challenge me i should have just made up a new pronoun we like to do that just to just to fuck

46:06.640 --> 46:15.600
with you i'm so i'm so stoked he he is a pronoun but i'm fucking um like my my dad was also like that

46:15.600 --> 46:22.960
when when i came out to him it's so great to meet you came out as what to your dad uh non-binary

46:22.960 --> 46:28.320
oh so but non-binary and but but but you can still you prefer pronoun it can just be whatever i mean

46:28.320 --> 46:33.280
it's it's it's a preferred yeah no there are there are actually a bunch and trans community is pretty

46:33.280 --> 46:39.440
positive when it comes to making up your own pronoun what goes it what goes into like like for you

46:39.440 --> 46:48.320
personally what if if um considering like i like i understand and don't understand like like okay

46:48.320 --> 46:55.920
non-binary but then in picking a pronoun is it based on utility or other yeah like is it is it

46:57.280 --> 47:01.280
is it a choice for other people or is it a choice for yourself when you pick a pronoun

47:01.280 --> 47:06.080
you individually not the royal you you're not representing anybody yeah no i get you to mean

47:06.080 --> 47:11.280
but it's like when you go out on the street it's like it's like it is a utility thing like how

47:11.280 --> 47:17.360
much energy am i gonna take to educate every person that i come across and also are they gonna

47:17.360 --> 47:23.840
beat me up if i'm like right you know you you hear uh my my voice started dropping recently

47:23.840 --> 47:33.760
and that's a pretty exciting thing for me but yeah thank you so so sometimes i'll do that

47:33.760 --> 47:38.400
and it's like a safety thing so if i feel somebody kind of like they give you the up and down and

47:38.400 --> 47:43.760
they clock you and and they're like all right sir come over here i'm like oh there yes yes i will

47:43.760 --> 47:52.000
come over there but other times if i if i look at somebody and based off of what they're wearing

47:52.000 --> 47:57.520
or like if they're millennial-ish looking i'll go oh yeah i use they them and usually they're like

47:57.520 --> 48:05.120
oh cool cool cool yeah yeah man it's a it's a i feel i feel compelled to say like do you

48:05.120 --> 48:11.360
remember you you know nova from the podcast uh yeah is she here are they here sorry i'm like i

48:11.360 --> 48:15.120
do that all the time i kind of feel compelled them or not i hope this isn't a betrayal of our

48:15.120 --> 48:19.600
because we talked about it after the show but but i feel like this is something you'd want people to

48:19.600 --> 48:24.080
know that that i you know how it's like like the first time i met nova it was like i'm immediately

48:24.080 --> 48:30.720
like oh i know i i do it too they said they and then i was like she and and she and whatever

48:30.720 --> 48:34.720
then i did it three times around and every time i like do the self deprecating thing where i'm like

48:34.720 --> 48:40.960
come on focus and stuff and then i was talking to nova after the show one time a couple weeks ago

48:40.960 --> 48:47.040
and another interesting conversation was actually because no rest for the wicked it's like that's

48:47.040 --> 48:56.240
actually now like like like nova was like like i don't i don't want to care that much if people

48:56.240 --> 49:01.920
fuck up i don't that that is not my choice to make a big deal out of it a preference is just a

49:01.920 --> 49:08.160
preference and and and uh at which point it occurred to me that it's actually it's it's

49:08.160 --> 49:14.320
another thing now that i have to keep in mind is like i kind of like take it all onto myself

49:14.320 --> 49:20.560
when i when i go like oh did i get that right it's all about me as opposed to just like continuing

49:20.560 --> 49:25.600
to grow and and take it and stride well i mean it's like that internalized anxiety is something

49:25.600 --> 49:33.120
i feel that every trans person has it's something like also white guilt as i'm white so i you know

49:33.120 --> 49:44.080
why are you laughing at white guilt if you just like yeah can i write a monologue for you to do

49:44.080 --> 49:52.480
about how white guilt is a serious issue let's do that next week makes you use your mayonnaise

49:54.000 --> 49:59.360
do you think of me me do you want it to be a monologue or a poem i'm kidding go ahead

49:59.360 --> 50:05.520
i do haiku thank you and then put it on twitter bless you sorry i continue we cut you

50:06.640 --> 50:10.800
we derailed you and then i do we have to move off this topic for just a quick section so we can

50:10.800 --> 50:16.320
talk about some of the clothing choices oh yeah yeah yeah well well but i i derailed you in the

50:16.320 --> 50:20.800
middle of a thought so i just wanted you to have a chance to finish on i don't yeah i don't think it

50:20.800 --> 50:26.320
was really going in yeah uh all right now let's talk about clothes can we please talk about these

50:26.320 --> 50:34.080

50:48.080 --> 50:54.800

54:25.280 --> 54:31.280
also just like changing one pair of old man's socks for the other like that's kind of how they

54:31.280 --> 54:37.360
treat temporary workers but that's all also how old the english education system is in japan and

54:37.360 --> 54:43.840
it's not working but how much japanese do you have to speak to teach english in japan um

54:43.840 --> 54:50.880
um

54:53.040 --> 54:59.200
it's on the oft repeated refraining them's fighting words yeah them thems are fighting words they'll

54:59.200 --> 55:05.280
just tell you oh my god your japanese is so good and you're just like i said hi yeah i know there's

55:05.280 --> 55:11.040

so much japanese it means i wow it means i know that means i understand sorry yeah yeah wait what's

55:16.720 --> 55:23.120
i could be i could be like riffing off of this like yeah it means goldfish what's what's what what

55:23.120 --> 55:29.600
what means i what's the it's the so the the one that you could use you could use uh for formal

55:29.600 --> 55:35.200
situations in all situations watashi watashi yeah and then but because you're a guy they have gendered

55:35.200 --> 55:42.400

59:43.440 --> 59:49.840
different on a a different thing that wasn't i the idea of of you kids like getting out all into this

59:49.840 --> 59:55.920
like retro gaming is i love it so much because it's like it's function over form it encourages

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:12.720

pixely form drives uh a lot of the what's the other one content yeah so it's um

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:31.520
um like when um green appeared in in in like the sort of vermouth green appeared in painting

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:14.800
pay for the subscription to uh watch you guys thank you thank you thank you thank you it's because

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:23.520
i i feel uh i share a lot of the the multiple shames that you uh exhibit the

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:32.400
no no hey this this man is a hero which one is a hero which one's for real which one would you

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:42.000
would you call my parfait of shames exquisite they're perfection i just want to hear it from

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:52.240
from a from a from a frenchman i have i have tasted your shame it is it is sublime

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:59.600
no yeah in a lot of ways you made me feel less alone

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.840
that that made you feel more alone

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.480
but because it was a bunch of lonely people doing that but yeah i know i hear that a lot

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.400
and in a good way i like i love hearing that that's my favorite that's my favorite thing

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.920
that we always come back around to when i'm getting cranky and going why are we doing

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:26.640
this and all this stuff so i'm glad to hear that uh it's it's public therapy in some way and um

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:35.920
i i loved uh a french comic that um like said this thing on scene like i'm his name

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:46.240
you probably never heard of it it's all right but uh in the 1980s uh he once went on stage in

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:56.080
his first one-man show uh show show this and you nailed it you nailed it you nailed it and uh

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:03.200
it was there like yeah i'm an exhibitionist and you're all warriors paying to see an exhibition

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:10.960
and that's little minded very little minded yeah so there was um a lot of you know this public

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:22.400
um psychotherapy and um this display of non narcissism trying to deal with it and and such

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:29.280
yeah those times are changing they keep telling me like apparently i think what happened over the

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.920
last five years is without actually making a conscious decision because when would you ever

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:39.120
fill out a change of address form we all moved over to the internet we started to consider it

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:46.560
real life and um and and and now that it is we've clearly entered an age where actually this you

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.480
know what you're describing which is the only thing that i ever thought i would be good for in

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:58.400
this world transparency like open like like kind of i'm never gonna do anything that remarkable

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:04.320
that's a dream why don't i just tell you everything i do what kind of thing um that's actually it's

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.760
it's become like sort of like walking out of your house with a noose around your neck and

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:14.480
i'm not feeling sorry for myself it's just like i'm what i'm lamenting is the end of that culture

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:22.400
actually being encouraged to 25 year olds i can't imagine being 25 right now and and having the

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:31.520
urges that i had when i was 25 to actually like i was like it was an ironic punk rock urge for me

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:39.760
at 25 to go i want everyone to know everything about me that was an ironic urge back then right

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:44.560
it was before it became fashionable yeah now now that's like hitting yourself in the face with a

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:51.440
hammer it's a cry for help it's and it's it's abusable and you asked for it if you engage in

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:58.240
that behavior because it's you know uh what are your feelings about this spangled jacket forgot

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:05.920
your name jimmy right starts with a j ends with a jimmy jimmy jimmy if you're gonna forget a name

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:14.320

i am goddamn jimmy freedom pretty dope what should what should what should take jimmy on the uh on

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:44.800
what i said this is an interview um oh you don't have to have one sorry i thought i interrupted

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:53.200
one uh spencer hey no but hey no you can't do that you can't you can't reprogram the show

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.440
with it was the lead i don't know i let's see where he's going it's all right fine all right

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:03.280
i'll give this five minutes but if my ratings start dipping i mean jimmy you probably have a

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:10.640
very active instagram yes okay so then you are totally qualified to answer this question um

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:18.080
um well what do you think the new honestly honestly y'all i i voted in the 2016 election

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:26.560
in california thank you and um helped legalize weed in california and uh and and we all thank

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.520
you for that right and so i've been back for three days so i'm high as fuck right oh shit

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:38.160
uh oh okay it's all right do you think there's gonna be like a new i forgot the question is

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:42.240
there gonna be like a new internet though like what jan was saying is that like it used to be

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:47.360
the internet was a secret place where you go to hide from like the world and complain about the world

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.760
but now the internet is the world so is there any place where it's like the internet was where we

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:57.280
retreat from there to where it's like now safe to complain about like i guess that's the real world

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:04.720
now right we retreat to the real world to complain about what's happening online well that's sad or

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:14.640
good it's definitely something right it's it's like when people talk to you about i'm on stage it's

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.520
cool let's keep i don't i don't know how no no you do it it's like it's like it's like when people

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:24.480
that you know on twitter talk to you in real life about things that they read about on twitter and

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.760
they'll like take you through the tweet verbally if you haven't seen it that's like that's strange

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:35.920
sort of doubling that's better than uh had people forcing you to watch youtube videos

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:43.360
just because it takes less time well yeah i think people are also going back to traditional

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:51.280
methods of communication i hate that like uh like letters or like you mean like letters and words

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:59.600
yeah like like snail mail i think he means postcards okay yeah it's hard to say like one

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.080
objective thing you can say is we're getting to a point where we're looking at the internet we're

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:09.600
going oh because we all live in this cloud where nothing is real and then but then the idea that

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:24.000
it's not real is alternatively weaponized and then but then idealized and i i get really alarmed

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:35.360
about the idea of sliding into convicted cynicism because the bad guys like that they love the idea

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:41.920
that if you get in a fight with a psycho five minutes into a fight with a psycho

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:48.960
all you really know is that you don't even know what the fuck is going on and it's like

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:56.000
their specialty it's like it's a win-win it's like it favors a person that just wants to

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:05.600
damage and it and it and it and it it it it it it disadvantages actual earnest communication

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.840
because like that that's the thing that i really really panic about is that point where we all go

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.600
well nothing's real nothing's real at all like yeah what did you see that on a screen well that

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.320
means is that means it either is or isn't real i would love to live in a world where it was like

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.040
did you see that on a screen that means it isn't real period but i don't think that we could

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:34.400
ever commit to that like we we will still we i mean we know that my favorite martian isn't real

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:43.440
but we he's our favorite martian um assuming we're all 70 um i just i just mean that like the

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.440
entire tv industry is based on the fact that when we see something on a screen we tend to love it

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:54.640
well we we we know that uh share isn't performing for us she's in a concert in scotland but we're

01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:02.800
like wow what a great good job she did in my living room like we we we we we we we we we

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.040
were transfixed by the screen even though we know it's not real so the internet is now saying like

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:14.400
oh and we're going to put thoughts in your head that say mankind is evil mankind is good these

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:22.640
universal truths are now up for sale and i i've um i got too drunk late in the podcast

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:34.240
yeah it's at this point where i become my own guest um kind of a surprise guest so it's like

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.360
as usual the the trope with this podcast is the question it turns into a story and

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:46.000
with the narrative you figure out what the actual question was which is just a story in

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.360
it of itself yeah i don't know yeah i mean what what you said for sure

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.080

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:46.000
what are your thoughts on retro video gaming um i mean all i had to add to that is uh one of my

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:53.520
friends started playing super mario like on his computer and then doing the twitch stream of it

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:58.160
but like it was hooked hooked up to his computer and in my experience it was always hooked up

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:06.960
up to that clunky console to my grandma's tv in the attic when uh the adults were getting drunk

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:17.440
downstairs you know and you should stream that huh yeah so all right john charles

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:24.720
are you a modern gamer do you game are you playing modern video games do you like fall out four

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:33.360
four all roads so you're romancing those npcs dan red did you see i i i'm not pointing at you

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:41.040
like hey uh you should score a point for me i i think he might be but well i i mean look i i i

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:48.560
want to i i went by my character i was proud of you a male ghoul i was like yeah he did it yeah

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:54.480
oh it's a ghoul and now you can't stop me now i'm fucking everybody across the wasteland yeah like i'm

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:59.520
just like taking people out like i'm like let's go shoot some things like keep checking in with

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:05.280
them how you feeling did you still not romance that one guy though now the president garvey i won't

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:10.400
i'm not i can't do it you have to commit man well because he's like you have to either come

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:18.400
into let them go you are you saying this from a coding perspective or from a or from a human nature

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:27.040
perspective you that i have to let prestan into my heart now from a you have to either love them

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:33.680
or let them go back into the pixel pool well they're gonna love other ayes yeah yeah love them or

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:39.520
let them go because the elephant in the wasteland with prestan garvey is that there is a button that

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.000
i clearly have not pushed because it's lit and up and it says let's keep this professional

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.760
and i keep not pressing that as much as i keep not pressing romance i keep pressing the fucking

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:55.840
string them along button because no well didn't you say it was uh didn't you say it was like

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.440
uncomfortable because he was always like hey i was thinking about committing suicide and then

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:06.400
it's like flirt you know it seems wrong it seems wrong to enable that it does like i i don't i feel

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:14.160
like but i don't really actually think that the end of the game would be uh fresh water restored

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.840
to the commonwealth and then i'm like walking with my dog and uh and then there's a pause and then

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:26.560
you hear a distant gunshot that would be good that'd be really good and then and then the games

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:35.840
has every choice matters you kept enabling him he told you he wanted to kill himself and instead

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.800
of talking to other people you told him good job he said he didn't want to anymore though

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.160
what time he said he didn't want to anymore right but he always says that

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:53.440
you know he keeps saying that but he also keeps bringing it up so i need i need i need everybody

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:58.400
who ever has that thought entering their head to tell anybody that they possibly feel comfortable

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:03.360
telling it to him being absolutely unashamed of it i do not want my relationships to start

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:09.920
that way i think that's dangerous it's unhealthy not dangerous maybe dangerous is too punitive

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:17.600
it's unhealthy it's not the right time to look up if you're if you're like yeah i just finished

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:23.120
battling the cosmos like i'm not even sure if i should be breathing or not and no but anyways

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:29.520
what's your birthstone like like no you're not ready to but maybe if you say flirt then maybe he'll

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.960
be like well i've just been having these dark thoughts so let's take it slow and then you'll

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.360
be like okay cool you know who knows but the relationship would forever no matter what his

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.760
behavior would would be the relationship would be forever tainted by this idea that the coupling

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:47.440
point was was that which me which would imply to me logically that if we ever broke it off

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.120
that he would be returning to the state that i met him in which was suicidal you're right that

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.840
isn't healthy i before i met you i was thinking of committing suicide i was like well get over that

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:05.040
yeah um and and love every love yourself and and all this stuff and then let's let's both

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.120
fuck around and make huge mistakes like like because neither of us are perfect and the goal

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:16.400
of relationships isn't perfection however definitely if someone's like a coupling point is like the

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:23.040
reason we should fuck right now is because i was about to kill myself that that i think those

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.920
tines need to have little scotch tape best buy things put on them works for me

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.160
can't tell you how much jimmy you look at jimmy i saw a look in your eye like you you're you're

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:42.080
like i can talk about this yeah well it was just like you're talking about listen if you're you're

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:48.960
saying no you're i'm dr j you just took away my chief move sorry go ahead i'm gonna let you finish

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:55.440
no no no i was i i did finish i was not letting you finish was my thing that was my thing um well

01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:01.040
the way if you say that every relationship it's not about perfection but then you're also talking

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:11.120
about uh like the perfect it like the relationship's path is predetermined so you're like you're

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.840
saying well i'm not going to go into it if it's not perfect you know oh no no no i didn't mean to

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:23.040
apply that i i it's hard it's hard to talk about there's no shared like vocabulary with it what

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:30.160
i was saying is in the kind of like uh these sort of like all i can picture it is uh like sort of

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:37.840
space modular like space station blocks and like they have like coupling points on them right like

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:44.160
so this thing's got a tab and this thing's got a slot or this thing's got a thing and it's like

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.080
like the way that we meet each other and the the things that we say over coffee and the

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:52.800
things that we say over the moments leading up to us actually maybe physically consummating a

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:59.520
relationship um and then the all of these things like that the flux that is welding us together

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:06.880
all i'm saying is um if if as in the end of speed did you ever see speed with keanu reeves and uh

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:13.760
uh sandra bullock they they make sure everyone knows throughout that movie this relationship

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:21.520
is not going to work why because it's based on speed yeah it's they care that's a nice refreshing

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:26.720
thing about that action movie they at least they say if there's a speed two one of us isn't coming

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:32.560
back and they both know it during speed because they're like did you know that i think because

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:39.760
of the way they say it is like really uh relationships built during trauma are not going to last what

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:51.360
is this oh no i'm on i'm on the stage just smartwatch dan fucking pick up me

01:20:51.360 --> 01:21:10.160
okay i'll try later like let's say you and i go into a liquor store together um and we go let's

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:16.080
uh let's get a lottery ticket and there we go oh shit i only have 50 cents uh what do you have

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:22.320
i only have 50 cents lottery tickets one dollar so we say let's split a lottery ticket um we're

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:29.680
gonna and then we we make the obvious choice whatever we win we'll split it right so we we barely

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:35.520
know each other or we know each other five years i don't know but well i should know because i'm

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:41.040
narrating this parable we've known each other six months we've known each other six months

countertop the guy takes him it gives us a scratch off we scratch it off holy shit five million

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:20.640
lottery together um here's the things that are reasonable to say we're both going to get half

of a lottery jackpot um this is a great day um we're doing awesome here's some things that are

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:42.160
harmless as that may seem if it's based on that moment it's you're building it on this thing

It's uncanny. I wouldn't be surprised not Spencer though him specifically with the short the shortness of the beard in the hair length

01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:16.060
He looks like me. Sorry. I just you guys keep talking. Don't let me telling you to keep

01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:24.540
Well, I change her house. What's the deal with the travel? So are you staying with friends? How are you getting around?

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:27.060
Do you have an RV? What's going on? I'm using

01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:30.860
Public transportation or my own two feet like

01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:33.700
so the before yesterday I

01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:37.500
had a tour of the odd deco building in

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:44.380
Danton LA and then took a stride through Echo Park and that was ten miles Wow

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:49.660
Not bad. Now the LA you can get from where we are right now to the beach

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:55.700
Are you gonna head out to Santa Monica at all? I did. Oh, well, don't be coy. Help me and yeah

01:31:55.780 --> 01:32:00.060
Yeah, so again with my architectural musings

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:04.420
I went from Santa Monica to Venice and then it was more to observe the

01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.900
Like the location of

01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:10.820
Californication and flaked. Oh, wow. Yeah, sure

01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:17.420
Yeah, and yeah, I visited the Venice canals and pretty dope. Yeah, they are

01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:20.020
I have a lot of

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:28.340
Like craftsman buildings. Oh, there's tons of craftsmen in the park and Silver Lake and let's feel this exactly and

01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:35.440
To my shame, I think this interest stems from the sitcom full house

01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:42.340
Of course of course food house. Yeah

01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:50.860
For the folks at home for the folks at home, what's kung fu house? I

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.300
Mean we all know

01:32:54.300 --> 01:33:01.140
Well kung fu house is about this, you know, Washington State sensei perfected

01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:03.980
his own brand of

01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.540
music kung fu and

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:10.220
Finds himself with his two son and his daughter without

01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:13.100
Someone to care for for his dojo

01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:15.460
so

01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:18.780
And thus

01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.300
He finds a new wife, but

01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:26.460
she also has two daughters and a son and

01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:29.900
this

01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.420
How do you know Mary both?

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:39.740
Very different because what I didn't tell you of course, I forgot. Is the brain much kung fu house?

01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:46.500
No, okay. I'm just double-checking. It's full house, and I was just riffing off the oh

01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:49.300
Oh, yeah

01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:52.300
Well, fuck this

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:59.300
It's full it's full house. He was saying full house, and I heard kung fu. I did too. And so he was

01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:03.020
I knew he was I knew he was making up kung fu house

01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:08.100
But what I didn't realize is that he was in order to make a make-up kung fu house

01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:11.260
He was stripping down the chassis of full house and

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.780
adding kung fu

01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:15.780
Fenders, I am not a very good

01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:17.940
my

01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:19.940
years as a

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:22.620
Game master didn't very much improve

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:28.220
My faculties to improve improvise on the start. I feel the same way

01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:31.540
It's true

01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:34.700

01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:01.100
It's a reference to our Australian tour. Oh god like that hat me

01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:05.660
Give it a good belt. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Here we go. Okay. Sorry. Look

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:20.580
Huh. Mm. Take two. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh, oh, oh oh, like

01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:29.140
Oh, hey like all like oh, hey

01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:35.280
I'm swapping out the phonemes higher

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:40.880
that their eye is an oy, and their eh is an eh.

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.200
That's spelling.

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.080
And so on.

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:46.320
So resulting in the following phrase

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:50.720
that I used to warm up for a show in Australia.

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.680
Oy, oyloik, the hit, mate.

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:56.680
Yeah!

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.180
Yeah!

01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:01.680
Oh, shit.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.880
Trudely, man, trudely.

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:08.240
Oy, oyloik, the hit, mate.

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.440
It's genuinely a true Australian accent.

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:14.240
The only problem is, no Australian talks like that.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:18.920
Because they're very gregarious, laid-back people.

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.600
Oh, I want that hat, mate.

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:24.800
It's perfect.

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:27.200
It's the same sound.

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:29.160
The truth is, I'm nailing the accent.

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.200
Yeah, I agree.

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.360
Any accent specialist would tell you he's nailing the accent.

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:39.120
The problem is, no one talks like that.

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:44.760
Because no one's ever going through the physical conditions

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.760
necessary to make you talk like that.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.240
However, I am nailing the accent.

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.280
I appreciate that.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:56.360
Oy, oyloik, oyloik.

01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:59.200
I'm going to try it with a different phrase.

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:08.200
Oy, oyloik, oyloik, oyloik, uh, uh, uh, ba-gah.

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.840
I'm so sorry.

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.760
I, we have people over all the time.

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.560
He's normally super polite to them.

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:23.200
I know he's been doing this for an hour and a half.

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.840
And I'm so sorry.

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.480
Let's first find out.

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:30.760
Oy, oyloik, oyloik, a ba-gah and a phrase.

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.840
All right, god damn it.

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.520
All right, god damn it.

01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:38.240
First, we're going to find out who he is.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.760
And a shake.

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.280
So that when he punches you in the face.

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.760
A land shake.

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:48.640
Oy, oyloik, a ba-gah and a phrase with a land shake.

01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:49.240
Oh, shit.

01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:52.520
Oh, no.

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.120
Oh, no, the booth.

01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.840
So let's get, uh, tell us who you are.

01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.640
And what brings you to Harmontowns?

01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.280
My name's Jordan.

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:03.160
And, um, I'm here because I've been listening to the podcast

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:04.960
for a few years.

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.720
It's crazy that I'm sitting on the stage.

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:07.920
Thanks, guys.

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.600
Eat the mic like this.

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.680
See, like me.

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:12.440
The mic.

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.360
Got to put that mic right there.

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:13.920
There you go.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.040
Right in front of my eyes.

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.440
Thank you so much.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.280
Yeah, come see after a long time listening, sir.

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:21.600
Are you, like, every Australian I've ever met,

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.240
and I say this in the most complimentary sense, are you?

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.720
And I'm not going to use the phrase, walk about.

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.760
J.C. Beck's question is the same thing.

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.440
Are you Beck Peckin across the country?

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:36.120
No, I'm actually, um, using airplanes.

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:36.520
Oh.

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:39.240
Yeah.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.400
Oh, damn.

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:42.280
I figured him out.

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:48.120
It was just so, so weird.

01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:49.880
Airplanes.

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.240
Can I, uh, what?

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:52.160
Can I say one thing?

01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.320
Are you, are you, yeah, what are you,

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.360
all right, we'll go ahead and see.

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:57.280
The first most shocking thing I've noticed,

01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:59.920
difference between Australia and America,

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:02.680
is the volume of water in your fucking toilet bowls.

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:03.440
Oh, yeah.

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:05.160
How much water do you need?

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:06.160
The splashback, man.

01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:08.920
I need all of that.

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:09.840
I'm busy later.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.640
I got stuff going on.

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:13.920
Come on, how many toilet, how many American toilets

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:16.280
have you met?

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.120
Four or five.

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.200
Yeah, and they go the wrong way around, too, when you're watching.

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.000
Oh, yeah.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:21.880
Do more of that.

01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:23.800
We like that.

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:25.920
No, I, when we went to Australia,

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.280
I was like, how do they, how do these toilets,

01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:29.680
they don't got any water?

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:31.960
How do they do that?

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:33.840
Like the toilets, they're more vertical,

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:38.920
so I think they get more speed dropping down,

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.600
to blast them back through the pipe.

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.360
I don't know how they got as physics.

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.120
It's crazy.

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:44.920
I think you're right.

01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:46.000
Yeah, I think so.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.320
Yeah, it's because our, our toilets

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.800
have gravity working on their sides.

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:52.200
Of course.

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:55.600
Your toilets are working against gravity,

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.280
because they're on the bottom of the earth.

01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.920
We have to run away from whatever we deliver.

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:03.200
So the turd is like having to be pulled up.

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:07.880
Like the core of the earth is sucking the turd up

01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:11.240
through a straw, like one of those Japanese drinks.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:13.440
But what's it called, a bobee, bobo?

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.360
Boba.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.560
The chocolate balls.

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:17.280
Bo, what?

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:17.840
Boba.

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.440
Boba.

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.160
Yeah.

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:20.240
Yeah, boba tea.

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.040
Yeah, boba, like a boba.

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:24.200
That's why I'm very glad to be here.

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.840
It makes a lot of mess, so yeah, glad to be here.

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:29.520
What do you do in Australia?

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:30.800
I work in a hospital.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.440
What do you do in Australia?

01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.520
Just working on computer stuff.

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.160
Can you get us things?

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.240
I can get you Tylenol and a Band-Aid.

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.800
Shit.

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:44.680
That's my clearance.

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:45.640
That's what I can get.

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:47.920
What are you doing here?

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.560
I made a mind, just moved to New York, so coming to visit him.

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:51.160
Oh.

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:53.640
You're going to be mad when you find out this is LA.

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:58.360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:59.680
Their maps are so different.

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:02.840
There was a sign that said, it's like 30 miles.

01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.800
Everything's like pinched, because Australia

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:06.400
is this big on their maps.

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:10.160
I saw a sign that said Broadway, so that's it, right?

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:14.280
You just take sunset to Broadway, yeah, yeah.

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:19.120
Practice, yeah, how long?

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:21.360
So your friend is moving to New York,

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.960
is your friend Australian?

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.360
Yeah, yeah, he's actually in the audience at the back, Harrison.

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.360
Yeah, he's in the middle.

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:33.520
Shout out to Harris, ha, ha, Harrison.

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:35.080
Can I teach you a short one?

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:35.720
What's that?

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:36.360
A short one?

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.200
Nice, it should be much easier to pronounce it.

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:38.880
Oh, yeah, give me one.

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:39.920
Fuck Oath.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:40.800
Fuck.

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:41.440
Fuck Oath.

01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:42.520
Fuck Earth?

01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:43.200
Fuck Oath.

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:44.800
You know, like a blood oath?

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.040
Fuck Earth.

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:46.840
Fuck Oath.

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:47.280
Oath.

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:48.160
Fuck Earth.

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:48.800
Oath.

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.400
Fuck Oath.

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.720
But what am I actually saying?

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.040
Fuck Oath.

01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:51.560
Yes.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:52.400
Oh, fuck Oath.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.120
Fuck Oath, mate.

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:57.120
Like, like Oath, are you actually saying fuck Oath?

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.360
No, it's, yeah.

01:42:58.360 --> 01:42:59.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.280
Don't maybe break it down.

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.840
Because you know how much traditional Australian society

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:06.240
respects oath?

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:07.320
Fuck Oath.

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:08.560
Fuck Oath.

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:14.000
The British had an oath, got us all sent here.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:14.680
Exactly.

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:21.320
Look at all our hats, mate.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.920
Fuck Oath.

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:23.800
Fuck Earth.

01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:25.280
We like those hats.

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.040
It's just because I learned, I tried to learn the,

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:31.520
the Australian accent is the hardest in the world.

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.400
Do you like it?

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:33.480
To everyone but Australians.

01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:35.440
Narrow.

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.800
You can't just fake it.

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:38.520
It's not, I mean, you could, look,

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:41.080
I'll do my, I'll do a flawless British accent.

01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:43.000
Give me a, give me a burrow.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:43.600
Half of you.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:44.600
I heard Leeds.

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:45.100
Oh.

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.280
Oh, what's Holy State?

01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.280
See, it's like.

01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:53.320
Perfect.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:58.280
Give me, give me another burrow of, I heard South Hampton.

01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:02.200
Oh, what shall we gain?

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:04.880
Like it's easy, it's common, it's the connection

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.880
between English English and American English.

01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:10.560
It's like, oh, you just, you just, all you do is,

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:13.920
you just, you just, you just purse your mouth a little bit.

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:17.080
You just, you just keep things down in front.

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:20.240
Australians hard, but I've mastered it.

01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:26.320
At the, at the expense of having to think very hard

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.360
about every syllable that I say,

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.920
which is not how anyone talks.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:32.680
I don't know if I've made that clear.

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:40.400
To prove my point, here is a flawlessly executed scene

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:52.480
called A Day at the Hat Store, where I will play,

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:57.200
well actually, Jordan, you will play the British

01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:03.040
Hat Store owner, and I will play an Australian,

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.480
what neighborhood are you from in Australia?

01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:07.280
I'm from Brisbane.

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:10.520
That's where I, my character's going to be from.

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:12.120
Brisbane.

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:15.280
Notice I didn't say Brisbane, you know why?

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.480
Because oh, I'm from Brisbane.

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:21.800
Can we have a little French love in there?

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:23.680
Oh shit.

01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:27.240
Yes, Jean-Charles will come in.

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:28.720
Are you sure?

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.200
Yes.

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.520
Yeah, you're all right, mate.

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:34.840
Welcome to my store, mate.

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:36.520
Where are you from?

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:39.320
Are you, are you British?

01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:41.600
Yeah, but we colonised Australia, so it's very similar.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.760
All right.

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:55.280
Oh, oh, oh, we like a hat.

01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:57.280
Mate.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.480
Any, what types of hats specifically are you talking about?

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:04.480
Oh.

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:12.480
What type of hat?

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.480
Yeah, is that, is that difficult?

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:29.720
Is the question, and my answer is type one.

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:35.160
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, thank you, thank you.

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:37.160
You're right.

01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:43.160
And the Frenchman can tell us what type of hat type one is.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:45.160
Of course, it's a...

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:47.160
What, what hat?

01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:49.160
Sorry, sorry.

01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:51.160
Sorry, what hat?

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:54.160
You're spelling in the hat, the Frenchman will walk in soon,

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:56.160
but not quite yet.

01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:58.160
Oh.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:00.160
Show him the felt hat.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.160
Thank you.

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.160
It's a felt hat.

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:09.160
Oh, love, feel, hit.

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:12.160
Mate, mate, mate, mate.

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:15.160
Our Frenchman comes in to rob the hat store.

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:17.160
Oh.

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:19.160
Sorry.

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:23.160
Give me your felt hat.

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:32.160
Sometimes people feel money, but this guy's coming for the felt hat.

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:34.160
Is that past tense?

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.160
Just give him the hat.

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:40.160
He refuses to leave until he drives it on.

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.160
Absolutely.

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:46.160
I have a wedding coming in now.

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:50.160
I can't find an angle.

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:52.160
Oi.

01:47:52.160 --> 01:48:03.160
I have a particular set of skills.

01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.160
My...

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:07.160
Oh, my God.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:13.160
So, leave the hat,

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:16.160
leave the hat,

01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:26.160
or face the wrath of me

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:33.160
with my particular set of skills.

01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.160
We'll have a two.

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.160
Sorry, what?

01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:39.160
Wait, wait, wait.

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:42.160
Come get a summer.

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:44.160
I slept to watch Italian there.

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:49.160
It's in.

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:50.160
Be careful.

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:51.160
Left.

01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:52.160
Right.

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.160
Kick.

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:56.160
Oh.

01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:57.160
I kick.

01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.160
Oi.

01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.160
Block.

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.160
Oh, aye.

01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:03.160
I am defeated.

01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:05.160
Oh.

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:11.160
Oh, yeah.

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.160
Oi, saved.

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.160
Yes.

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.160
Fuck off, you did.

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:18.160
Fuck off.

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:21.160
And then they say, they're clapping because they're like,

01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:23.160
stop, do something else now.

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.160
Change the subject.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:27.160
That was that segment.

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:31.160
Alright, wow, what a show, you know?

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:33.160
It's just...

01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:36.160
We still got a little...

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:38.160
Who said the show has to end?

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:39.160
It's Monday night.

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:42.160
No one said the show ever has to go until 10.

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:43.160
I did.

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.160
I did say that.

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:46.160
No, you're right.

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:47.160
Let's leave.

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:50.160
There's so much more business for us to take care of.

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:52.160
Alright, give me a beat.

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.160
You know...

01:49:54.160 --> 01:50:00.160
Oh shit.

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:06.160
Yo.

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:07.160
Yep.

01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:08.160
Yo.

01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:09.160
Yeah.

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.160
Oh.

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.160
Yeah.

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:12.160
Oh.

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:13.160
Yeah.

01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:14.160
Oh.

01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.160
Yeah.

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:16.160
Oh.

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:17.160
Oh.

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:18.160
Oh.

01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:19.160
Yeah.

01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:20.160
Oh, okay.

01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.160
Yeah.

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.160
Yeah.

01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:23.160
Yeah.

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:28.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, here we go, yeah, all right, here we go, yeah.

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.620
One, two, three, four.

01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:47.720
Wrapping walls, door, ceiling, foundation, soil,

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:52.720
snake, coil, rattlesnake, strike, fangs, yikes, venom in the veins.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:57.720
The poison runs through me and now it's going to rain,

01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:00.720
supreme and down on all of those I love.

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:04.720
You thought that I was a lion, but now I am a dove.

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:07.720
I take flight on the wings of people,

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:10.720
I take flight on the wings of people,

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:14.720
I take flight on the wings of people,

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:17.720
I take flight on the wings of peace,

01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:22.720
I fucked your mama so hard, she gave me a Reese's peace.

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:28.720
For my trouble, hit a bubble.

01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:34.720
Australians all let us rejoice, for we are young and free.

01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:39.720
The rest of that has escaped my mind.

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:44.720
It's our national anthem, skin-liddy.

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:52.720
I like that hat, yo, I like that hat, mate.

01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:56.720
Yo, I like that hat, mate.

01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:02.720
Yo, yo, me and my mate were buying hats.

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:08.720
And I said to my mate, yo, what's that?

01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:16.720
He said, yo, I love you.

01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:23.720
I said, I also love you.

01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:30.720
I also love you.

01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:33.720
The two of us didn't get too far.

01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:36.720
It was hard for us to talk.

01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:38.720
Thank you, mate.

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:40.720
Poor boy, mate.

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:42.720
Band-aids?

01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:44.720
Yo, building seven.

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:46.720
Where's building seven?

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:48.720
Where's building seven?

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:51.720
Where's building seven?

01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:53.720
Sorry.

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:02.720
Too soon, too soon.

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:09.720
Back to the Future has...

01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:11.720
Okay.

01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:12.720
All right.

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:13.720
No, stop it.

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:15.720
I mean, obviously stop it before you start a new song.

01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:21.720
That's got to be whatever your job title is, 101.

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:26.720
Don't make that sound.

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:30.720
You're feeling what I'm feeling.

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:32.720
You're looking for an out.

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:34.720
You're looking for an ending.

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:35.720
You want drama.

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:36.720
You want intrigue.

01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.720
It's an improvised show.

01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:41.720
It's not going to have a sloppy ending.

01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:42.720
Yes, it is.

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:44.720
Quickfire questions?

01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:45.720
Yes, Nova.

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:47.720
I don't have any.

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.720
I was just saying we should do quickfire questions.

01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:50.720
All right.

01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:52.720
Questions for Nova?

01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:54.720
Oh, Nova.

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:56.720
Do you have any quickfire questions?

01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:57.720
No.

01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:58.720
Okay.

01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:00.720
Quickfire questions.

01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:01.720
Who's got them?

01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:02.720
Dan.

01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:03.720
Yes, Spencer.

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:04.720
How do you feel about that hat?

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:06.720
I like it.

01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:07.720
Next.

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:12.720
Water land.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:13.720
Water or land?

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:14.720
Water or land?

01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:16.720
Land for the wind.

01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:17.720
Tough but fair.

01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:20.720
I mean, as far as preference, not a prediction of what will

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:21.720
overcome.

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:25.720
Give us a little bit of what, two things.

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.720
I want to know what new fucking thing you learned because the

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:30.720
last time you were here, you had been all up in the hominids

01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:33.720
book and I'm sure you have moved on to something else we

01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:34.720
could hear about.

01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:37.720
The last thing, what are you doing before you leave this week?

01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:40.720
What's the thing you're going to do this week that's the thing

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:41.720
that's been stopping you?

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:43.720
No, I'm just playing fallout in bed.

01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:45.720
I can't talk about anything that's going on in my real life.

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:46.720
That's important.

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:48.720
That's part of what I'm hiding from is the fact that I've

01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:51.720
entered a phase of my career in my life where I'm not actually

01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:54.720
allowed to talk about the very most important things, the most

01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:57.720
entertaining things that I could ever talk about, the things that

01:54:57.720 --> 01:54:59.720
would be the most interesting for everybody here.

01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:01.720
I actually can't think of anything like that.

01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:04.720
I'm the most interesting for everybody here.

01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:06.720
I actually can't talk about them.

01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:08.720
Can you tell if they're fun?

01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:11.720
I'm made a liar by a dishonest society.

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:13.720
That's what happens.

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:15.720
You become worth money.

01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:18.720
People come to you and they say, become a liar.

01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:19.720
Here I come.

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:20.720
Oh, welcome.

01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:22.720
Welcome into my home.

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:24.720
It's the fucking worst.

01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:27.720
I'm somehow going to survive.

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:28.720
Yeah.

01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:30.720
I'm sure that there's something outside of work that is on the

01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:31.720
back of your head.

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:32.720
Yeah.

01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:33.720
That's a phrase.

01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:34.720
On the back of your head.

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:35.720
But I can't talk.

01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:36.720
I can't.

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:37.720
I can't.

01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:38.720
No, no, no.

01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:39.720
Apart from work.

01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:40.720
I can't talk about anything.

01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:41.720
Let's not talk about work.

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:42.720
Let's not talk about work.

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:44.720
Let's talk about, you know, there's got to be a house project.

01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:46.720
There's got to be a thing, a book to read.

01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:47.720
Just fall out.

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:48.720
I'm just playing.

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:49.720
There's Harmon Quest.

01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:50.720
We tape in November.

01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:51.720
Harmon Quest.

01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:52.720
And if you go to Harmonquest.com.

01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:53.720
Yes.

01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:55.720
If you go to Harmonquest.com, you can find where you can get

01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:56.720
tickets.

01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:58.720
We're taping like mid-November or some shit.

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:00.720
It's going to be in Burbank.

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:03.720
So yeah, we'd love it to get some people in the audience that

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:04.720
enjoy it.

01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:05.720
Yeah.

01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:06.720
Sorry to cut you off, Dan.

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:08.720
But I, it's the only thing I remembered.

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:09.720
It was a beautiful thing.

01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:10.720
No, you didn't cut me off.

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:14.720
Now how do you have a live audience if it is animated?

01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:15.720
Oh.

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:16.720
Well.

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:17.720
Yeah.

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:18.720
It's very.

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:19.720
Oh, no.

01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:20.720
Woo.

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:29.720
The fall.

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:31.720
Oh, no.

01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:32.720
Oh, Reverend.

01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:35.720
How do you have a live audience?

01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.720
Oh, Reverend Carvasier.

01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:38.720
Oh.

01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:43.720
I can see one of the deacons has been sneaking a sip of my

01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:44.720
Carvasier.

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:52.720
I told you, Dan, if you come to this church, you will need to

01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:53.720
bring it on.

01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.720
Oh, Reverend.

01:56:54.720 --> 01:57:01.720
Man, a drunk priest on like a cable, like a basic cable or

01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:05.720
free public access Christianity show, that could be something

01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:08.720
and I'm pitching it next week.

01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:10.720
You and me, Brandon, we're going to Netflix.

01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:11.720
Awesome.

01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:13.720
They have so much money.

01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:14.720
Yeah, man.

01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:16.720
So no back end.

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:18.720
You'll be participating in no back end.

01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:21.720
Oh, I get back end, but let's not talk about that.

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:22.720
No.

01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:23.720
I got.

01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:24.720
Yeah.

01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:26.720
Thank you so much to Nova for stopping by.

01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:27.720
Yes.

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:31.720
That is your cue to exit.

01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:33.720
We'd love to have you.

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:35.720
I'm not picking on you first.

01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:37.720
I'm going to say this to everyone who is on stage as we wind

01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:39.720
down here at Harmontown.

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.720
One more time for Nova.

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.720
Thank you so much, Nova.

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.720
What a shooting star.

01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:45.720
No.

01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:49.720
Jimmy, you will be the next contestant up to leave the stage.

01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:50.720
Thank you so much.

01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:52.720
So like for everything.

01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:54.720
You look fabulous.

01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:57.720
You look like a million fucking dollars.

01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:01.720
Ladies and gentlemen, please say a huge thank you to Jean Charles

01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:02.720
tonight.

01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:03.720
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:13.720
he wrapped in French.

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:15.720
He wrapped in French folks.

01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:17.720
You come to Harmontown.

01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:19.720
He'll pick it up.

01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:20.720
What do you say?

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:21.720
He's picking it.

01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:22.720
He's picking it up.

01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:23.720
No, man.

01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:25.720
Don't go behind us, man.

01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:27.720
He's upstage in our asses.

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:28.720
He left a book.

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:29.720
He was so polite.

01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:31.720
So European about it.

01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:33.720
He was like, I left a book.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:35.720
I'm going to go around and pick it up.

01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:37.720
And now he pulls out the gun.

01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:40.720
So excellent.

01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:44.720
I'm sorry that the entire European Union is also sliding

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:45.720
fascist.

01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:49.720
But see in hell, I mean, right?

01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:52.720
That phrase is taken on a new hopeful tone.

01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:53.720
You too.

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:54.720
You too.

01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:56.720
Don't you have like kind of a, you know,

01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:01.720
Hitler down there?

01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:02.720
Pauline Hansen.

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:04.720
Oh, God bless all of us.

01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:07.720
There's just every continent across the planet.

01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:09.720
Boy, when have we ever seen that happen?

01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:11.720
Right before what?

01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:14.720
And on that note,

01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:17.720
this has been Harmontown.

01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:19.720
We love you so much.

01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:21.720
Spencer Crittenden and Dan Harmon,

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:24.720
our friend, the Australian,

God knows, Zac McKeever,

I've been Brandon Johnson.

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:32.720
We miss you, Jeff Davis.

01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:33.720

Thank you.

Church, we love you.

01:59:37.720 --> 02:00:01.720
Good night.
