{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.800\nWhere am I? Where am I? Oh my god, I'm at Harmon's Town, ladies and gentlemen. I hope you\n\n00:12.800 --> 00:19.920\nare too. How lucky are all of us. Make some noise. So good to see you.\n\n00:19.920 --> 00:36.000\nPlease welcome to the stage, the most wonderful, the incomparable Spencer Critt.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:47.180\nYeah! The man of the moment. King, rule, shocker, maker, breaker. You know him at\n\n00:47.180 --> 00:54.160\nDen Harmon. Let's call him Den Harmon, the mayor of Harmontown, Den Harmon.\n\n00:58.160 --> 01:13.360\nThank you. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. I want to thank you. I want to thank you.\n\n01:13.360 --> 01:25.720\nYou've been so good to me. I want to have gratitude. When I was just a little boy, I couldn't thank\n\n01:25.720 --> 01:35.420\nanyone for a toy. So my rhymes were weak. But then my mom took a peek down my diaper,\n\n01:35.420 --> 01:57.640\nand she saw, damn, a Sherman tank, incest, damn. Okay.\n\n01:57.640 --> 02:13.600\nThanks. It's it's it's knowing when to take the art away. As Donald Sutherland says at six\n\n02:13.600 --> 02:24.240\ndegrees of separation. I got, I got one of those zits right in the crease of my nose.\n\n02:24.240 --> 02:34.200\nNo. What is skin thinking? Like what? How hard? I know. I already know the answer. I know the\n\n02:34.200 --> 02:41.880\nanswer. There's no God is the answer. It was what we have. We arrived at over billions of years\n\n02:41.880 --> 02:48.400\nof improv. Like it, otherwise someone would say, you know, I think I can figure out a better way\n\n02:48.400 --> 02:54.800\nto coat a gingerbread man in like latex, you know, like, and like, we wouldn't have to have\n\n02:54.800 --> 03:04.560\nfucking like, systems of sebum and like, like, like ingrown for epiduemuses. Like, it's insane.\n\n03:04.560 --> 03:10.680\nAnd all topped off with, you know, there's a, there's the most important part of your skin.\n\n03:10.680 --> 03:18.240\nThe fact that it's covered completely covered every square centimeter of it in microscopic\n\n03:18.240 --> 03:26.000\nflora. And not a little fauna. And because if it weren't there, then there's all these things in\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:30.320\nthe air that would land and they would go like, I'm gonna set up shop here. You are protected\n\n03:30.320 --> 03:37.520\nevery minute of every day by the fact that you are infested by beasties that live in harmony with\n\n03:37.520 --> 03:44.160\nyou. Life is a prison. It's a prison cell. There's a lot of people in the cell with us. Yeah,\n\n03:44.160 --> 03:57.600\nyou're, you're, you're alive because you're a bitch. You traded your integrity to see another day\n\n03:57.600 --> 04:10.480\nbehind bars. You could have gone out a man. I know I sound like I'm quoting a movie or something.\n\n04:10.480 --> 04:17.760\nI got a movie about a guy who goes to prison and has to choose between dying brave and living\n\n04:17.760 --> 04:26.480\ncowardly. Okay. It was really professorial. Yeah. I got a, I got a, I got a new phone case. It's real\n\n04:26.480 --> 04:33.680\nbig. Okay. It's got what, what made it just a magnet instead of the thing. It's just a magnet.\n\n04:34.320 --> 04:38.800\nWhat, what made you replace it? I'm just, I got a new phone and I, you know,\n\n04:38.800 --> 04:42.480\nI was going to get the new case for the new phone, you know, because it's different size.\n\n04:42.480 --> 04:52.240\nDoes that one take those 3D pictures? Yeah, the an emojis. No, no. I've been seeing on Facebook,\n\n04:52.240 --> 04:57.680\nthere's these 3D photos of dogs. So you'll be scrolling through Facebook and then there'll be\n\n04:57.680 --> 05:06.800\nthis 3D dogs staring right at you in 3D. No, no. And it's like, well, photos aren't in 3D. This is\n\n05:06.800 --> 05:13.680\ncrazy. And it's just this big old dog staring right at you. Like coming out of the screen.\n\n05:13.680 --> 05:20.080\nOh, coming right out. Yeah, it's weird. You don't, because it doesn't look like it'll work, but like\n\n05:20.080 --> 05:26.160\nthe parallax of the screen and the photo movement as you scroll through it, it has this weird,\n\n05:26.160 --> 05:31.600\nyou know, 3D effect to it. But I thought it was some iPhone thing and maybe it's not.\n\n05:31.600 --> 05:39.040\nHmm. I wouldn't know. Yeah, I'm not plugged in. Me neither. I used to know all, I used to work\n\n05:39.040 --> 05:48.160\nat Apple. I used to know all the Apple stuff. Now it's like just sad. Whenever I show people my,\n\n05:48.160 --> 05:52.960\nmy, my phone case, they, they go, oh, it's like a wallet, you got your credit cards in there and\n\n05:52.960 --> 05:58.560\nstuff. I go, yeah, I do. Cash and all that stuff. And then they always, every single person, they\n\n05:58.560 --> 06:07.280\nalways want to like, this is just like some weird human instinct. They go, so you should, you know,\n\n06:07.280 --> 06:11.840\ndon't, don't you think that's a little dangerous? Because now if you lose one thing, you lose everything.\n\n06:12.480 --> 06:16.800\nAnd I go, well, you just, just think about what your brain is doing right now. Like,\n\n06:17.840 --> 06:23.360\nlike you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're holding\n\n06:23.360 --> 06:32.640\nvigil over a, a, a society, an ideal society where we aerosol our property to, to the extent that\n\n06:32.640 --> 06:37.200\nall of it's expendable. What are you talking about? Everyone's got like four things in their\n\n06:37.200 --> 06:43.760\npocket. Yeah. If you lose any of them, you're fucked. Nobody wants to lose any of them. You\n\n06:43.760 --> 06:49.600\ndon't want to lose your keys, your phone or your wallet. So why the fuck? Yeah, no shit. If I lose\n\n06:49.600 --> 06:54.880\none thing, I'm fucked. Why would you, it's, it's, what is that instinct that we have? Like, oh,\n\n06:54.880 --> 06:59.760\nyeah, if you think about it, you're kind of fucked. Yeah. No, I'm not. I'm no more fucked than you.\n\n06:59.760 --> 07:04.480\nI have one thing to remember and one thing that fucks me and you have four things to remember\n\n07:04.480 --> 07:10.480\nand each one fucks you a quarter. Like, who cares? Well, what is this quibbling? You're, you're,\n\n07:10.480 --> 07:14.720\nyou're a nonsense person. You should be ashamed of yourself. Here's, here's something that you,\n\n07:14.720 --> 07:21.200\nyou lost a long time ago. You're shame. Yeah. Let me get you a big case for that so that when\n\n07:21.200 --> 07:27.840\nyou lose it, you know, you should have put a hubcap on that shit. It's been gone since the 70s.\n\n07:33.360 --> 07:38.320\nI would, I would buy a shame case. I don't need no shame case.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.360\nAlso, if that were true, you'd be like, you wouldn't put shit in your house because people would\n\n07:43.360 --> 07:48.160\nsay the same shit to you. Like, now all the shit's in your house. Well, how about your fucking skull?\n\n07:48.160 --> 07:55.760\nWho, what do you cut your whole brain in one skull? What do you tie? Oh, just the two eyeballs then.\n\n07:55.760 --> 08:03.920\nSo, uh, both necessary for depth perception. Yeah, I done one pancreas. What are the, whoa, who,\n\n08:05.440 --> 08:10.400\nwho are you? Are you an ant? Is it, are you an insect person here to like, like, like,\n\n08:10.400 --> 08:19.280\nyou're like, not very modular, are you? Your identity isn't, isn't sprayed in a wide enough\n\n08:19.280 --> 08:25.760\ncone for me to give you a license to be safe. Well, I don't like about that critique is that\n\n08:25.760 --> 08:30.880\nit fundamentally relies on someone essentially explaining to you what it means for things to\n\n08:30.880 --> 08:38.560\nbe grouped together. It's like, yeah, no, those things are together. That's a good point. The\n\n08:38.560 --> 08:45.760\nsame way as if I'm wearing a watch and my arm gets cut off, I'd have lost my watch because those\n\n08:45.760 --> 08:54.960\nthings are together. Or if my head was cut off, my glasses, they'd also be off my body because\n\n08:54.960 --> 09:03.440\nthese things are together. My head hair would also be off my body being with the thing that was\n\n09:03.440 --> 09:09.600\nremoved from, because they're together. That's what that means. So I mean, on the one hand,\n\n09:09.600 --> 09:14.240\nit's bullying you, but on the other hand, it's like, Hey, what do you think it means when stuff is\n\n09:14.240 --> 09:20.480\nassociated with other stuff? Let me break this thing down to you. Yeah, that's what it really is.\n\n09:21.280 --> 09:26.400\nThat's being like, that's being like, empathic and going like, well, what's really happening in\n\n09:26.400 --> 09:30.480\ntheir brain? They're, they're trying to connect. Right. They're like, I know what things are when\n\n09:30.480 --> 09:35.280\nthey're next to each other. They're next to each other. Right. Right. They're just saying something.\n\n09:35.280 --> 09:40.880\nRight. That's this and it doesn't make me less pissed, but I think I'm growing because instead\n\n09:40.880 --> 09:45.600\nof just getting pissed, I'm getting pissed and having the thought, which is anytime someone says\n\n09:45.600 --> 09:50.080\nsomething that pisses me off, it's just they had a thought and they were like, Oh, I want to share\n\n09:50.080 --> 09:54.320\nthis thought. And they did it. And they didn't think about the ramifications of that action and\n\n09:54.320 --> 09:59.040\nhow much it would piss me off. But they were just so excited that they said whatever dumb\n\n09:59.040 --> 10:03.600\nfucking shit that they did before passing it through a filter. And I'm still fucking pissed,\n\n10:03.600 --> 10:13.760\nbut recognizing that feels like growth. I don't know. And that wasn't that's just free association.\n\n10:13.760 --> 10:18.320\nThat wasn't me trying to apply my situation to yours. I'm not trying to be mad at those people.\n\n10:18.320 --> 10:24.800\nDon't get me wrong. Okay. That last part was a setback. But yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I was just in a\n\n10:24.800 --> 10:31.760\ntrance. I mean, and then, and then, you know, I think you and I could both say then also,\n\n10:33.360 --> 10:38.640\nwell, it's these, this other person who maybe they maybe they're just they're,\n\n10:39.600 --> 10:45.200\nthey're their little Honda generator. It runs runs a little faster. It's got what it's got less\n\n10:45.200 --> 10:50.480\nCCs. I don't I don't know what like what the metaphor would be like, because it doesn't do\n\n10:50.480 --> 10:56.960\nus any good to be because the reason we're mad. Okay, let me start over. The reason we're mad when\n\n10:56.960 --> 11:07.680\nit happens is because it's not fair because we feel anguish and anxiety and shame. Right? Sure.\n\n11:07.680 --> 11:11.040\nIsn't that isn't that why you get mad when someone cuts you off on the freeway? Really,\n\n11:11.040 --> 11:16.880\nit's not it's not like I mean, some if they if they almost kill you, like, like, like, there's\n\n11:16.880 --> 11:22.240\nadrenaline and there's holy shit. If anything, usually when it's a really close call, you actually\n\n11:22.240 --> 11:28.160\nkind of feel a sense of elation and don't remember the other person exists until a couple seconds\n\n11:28.160 --> 11:36.000\nlater. But it's like the thing that pushes you off about the lack of consideration in it's always\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:42.800\nit doesn't it doesn't the root of that hair. It's not fair because I put myself through so much\n\n11:42.800 --> 11:49.600\nin order to not be that person. And that person isn't even doing it. And I yeah, to me, I mean,\n\n11:49.600 --> 11:55.440\nit sounds like the same feeling. But to me, it's like, how dare you even assume I haven't put that\n\n11:55.440 --> 12:00.160\nwork in. I'm putting all the fucking work in you put the work in and realize I put the work in and\n\n12:00.160 --> 12:05.200\nshut the fuck up. Because it's like, I'm trying over here. What are you doing yelling at me for\n\n12:05.200 --> 12:11.920\nyou think I'm not trying your fucking blind? Shut up. Not like blind blind. You can't see yeah,\n\n12:11.920 --> 12:17.680\nwhatever. I'm it's good. I live with it. How are you guys doing?\n\n12:24.800 --> 12:31.360\nI guess there is a it's you get it's it's you're mad because they're they're insulting you.\n\n12:31.360 --> 12:37.120\nRight. To me, it just feels like yeah, I'm smart. I know this stuff. Are you like it just feels like\n\n12:37.120 --> 12:41.440\nthey're trying to like pretend I don't know this stuff. That's like, yeah, no fucking shit.\n\n12:41.440 --> 12:50.560\nThings are next to each other. But and maybe maybe I'm just kind of maybe are we supposed to then\n\n12:50.560 --> 12:58.800\nlike because I'm sure when we're talking, I'm sure constantly you say something and then I say\n\n12:58.800 --> 13:05.360\nsomething back that you knew I was going to say and that I and that and that I knew that you knew\n\n13:05.360 --> 13:11.920\nalready. But that's like we're just like hitting the thing. But there's categories of doing that\n\n13:11.920 --> 13:20.640\nthat piss us off. Like I think like two zebra scientists can probably make small talk and go\n\n13:20.640 --> 13:25.920\nlike, Oh, there's a new zebra in the paddock. And then and then the other one says like,\n\n13:26.720 --> 13:31.840\nhope this one doesn't get herpes. Like because the zebras keep getting herpes in the paddock.\n\n13:31.840 --> 13:40.400\nYou're not supposed to know I'm filling this in as we go. It's a nonlinear it's a it's a showtime\n\n13:40.400 --> 13:50.240\noriginal this show. The but but but kind of the guy the zebra expert wanted him to say that because\n\n13:50.240 --> 13:56.080\nhe's he didn't want to have to say there's a new zebra in the paddock and now I'd like to talk about\n\n13:56.080 --> 14:01.200\nthe last one getting herpes like he doesn't want that burden he wants to be able to actually just\n\n14:01.200 --> 14:07.760\nlike bump the shuttlecock up near the net. Right. We have this agreement that we're going to talk\n\n14:07.760 --> 14:12.560\nabout things that two people would talk about mutually not not anything in the history that\n\n14:12.560 --> 14:17.920\nwe can't relate on not any future dreams that we we can't really jump in on we we as people have\n\n14:17.920 --> 14:22.480\nthis contract where we're like, we're friends because you know when to change the subject.\n\n14:23.200 --> 14:29.200\nRight. The timing. Yeah. And the person that you don't like is a person who doesn't know when\n\n14:29.200 --> 14:33.760\nto change the subject. That's like the most basic part of friendship is like we're friends with\n\n14:33.760 --> 14:37.440\nthe kid that your friends with some from six years old on because every time you brought up paste\n\n14:37.440 --> 14:43.200\nthat motherfucker was like you should see paste or that motherfucker was like I don't like paste and\n\n14:43.200 --> 14:48.240\nyou're like yeah fuck paste like that's the contract so we get really frustrated with people\n\n14:48.240 --> 14:53.120\nwhen it looks like they're trying to slime us or cheat on the fucking contract and not putting a\n\n14:53.120 --> 14:57.680\nlot of thought into what you're going to say it's cheating on the contract and we try to do that\n\n14:57.680 --> 15:02.320\nshit right so we get pissed we get insecure we're like wait a second am i being fucked am i being\n\n15:02.320 --> 15:11.760\nfucked i'm being fucked right you knew god damn well you were supposed to bring up the green\n\n15:11.760 --> 15:19.200\nbaby packers right i said man i sure do love wisconsin and you looked at me talking about\n\n15:19.200 --> 15:29.680\npasta's delicious sometimes that's called an emotional bid right yes that was like the first\n\n15:29.680 --> 15:35.200\nthing i learned in couples therapy emotional bids which actually i have to say i hope Cody doesn't\n\n15:35.200 --> 15:39.360\nlisten to this because i have to cop to the fact that lately well she understands i i apologize\n\n15:39.360 --> 15:45.040\nto her today i've been buried in my laptop like i'm kind of hiding from some shit and uh like\n\n15:45.040 --> 15:50.240\ni'm hiding from shit next to her and i'm using my laptop and we love each other and stuff but\n\n15:50.240 --> 15:55.040\nnevertheless i have been i'm looking at the last week and i have not been matching emotional bids\n\n15:55.040 --> 16:01.600\nemotional bids are just just anything it's the pixel of relationship communication uh you know\n\n16:01.600 --> 16:08.480\nwe've i that was that was the first thing because it was like oh if someone says look look out the\n\n16:08.480 --> 16:16.160\nwindow at the st louis arch while you're driving past the st louis arch oh god you you i i i i hate\n\n16:16.160 --> 16:22.080\nit don't make me look at stuff i hate i'm talking like like like every time someone makes me look\n\n16:22.080 --> 16:28.640\nat something i there's a transaction happening and i'm like i'm like it's all kinds of fucking\n\n16:28.640 --> 16:36.160\nhorrible shit circuit boards that were designed to be mounted in defense satellites in an era\n\n16:36.160 --> 16:43.520\nthat is bygone this equipment is not needed anymore it is only hurtful and but it's like\n\n16:43.520 --> 16:48.720\nthe numbers i'm crunching when it's like hey look at this thing on my phone like and i just like\n\n16:48.720 --> 16:52.480\nlike one little part of my brain going like you just made me look at something oh that's cool\n\n16:56.720 --> 17:03.040\nno no you fucking cop i'm sorry but but you're not supposed to think it's like it's an emotional\n\n17:03.040 --> 17:08.400\nbit if it's even if it seems futile somebody's saying like it's like small talky stuff for\n\n17:08.400 --> 17:12.880\nwhatever this oh look at that look at this look at that it's somebody checking in\n\n17:13.760 --> 17:20.080\nand saying are you with me like what's more redundant than holding hands it's already a hand\n\n17:20.080 --> 17:26.560\nlike what if anything you're if anything you're you're taking two hands off the grid\n\n17:26.560 --> 17:33.440\nbut you're actually you're actually downgrading half of each of your hand supply\n\n17:35.120 --> 17:42.640\nit's certainly not practical it's definitely not edifying it's it doesn't like teach you\n\n17:42.640 --> 17:50.000\nnew things about your hand um uh and yet we definitely do it and we do it 85 year old people\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:58.640\ndo it uh in our in our dream of how we'd like to go out i think most

twitter now so i never know i hear random\n\n28:11.440 --> 28:16.880\nthings i feel like one thing a week like i'm 80 years old like i know one news item a week or one\n\n28:16.880 --> 28:23.760\nor one like just human interest piece and uh it it it it and i can't tell the difference between\n\n28:23.760 --> 28:27.360\nthe ones that are so played out and everyone's talking about them whatever oh because dan\n\n28:27.360 --> 28:30.400\nbefore when you were on twitter you were you you really had your finger on the pulse and\n\n28:31.280 --> 28:36.640\nwe were calling you the dick dick clark of our generation um all right well i don't i don't\n\n28:36.640 --> 28:44.000\nknow who you are you sound exactly like me so let's not have a conversation why not we'll see\n\n28:44.000 -->

i are talking to each other right\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:14.560\nnow and no one can tell exactly it just sounds like one guy talking because we have the same voice\n\n29:18.400 --> 29:26.960\nDan Harmon meets Dan Harmon and Dan Harmon the two uh so i heard one sniglet one little thing\n\n29:26.960 --> 29:34.800\njust random shit i hear there's a tinder or the company that owns tinder the they don't want\n\n29:34.800 --> 29:42.720\nall the tenders the hydra of all the dating swipies um they were gonna they were gonna or\n\n29:42.720 --> 29:49.360\nthey are i i they they were gonna start charging people over 40 like like yeah they've been extra\n\n29:49.360 --> 29:52.880\nis that was that a thing that everybody was like talking about yeah they've been doing that one\n\n29:52.880 --> 29:57.120\nlike the idea that if you're over 40 you have to pay a little extra to be on the\n\n29:58.320 --> 30:03.200\nthat's fair that's fair i just thought that was so amazing because it's such a perfect it's beyond\n\n30:03.200 --> 30:07.840\nlogan's run all the way into just like because it's like obviously the natural inversion of that is\n\n30:07.840 --> 30:14.000\nlike you know and if you're 25 obviously hey whoa it's on the house and then if you're 20 hey here's\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:23.040\n50 bucks and then you keep on going down all the way to the point where if you're pregnant your\n\n30:23.040 --> 30:30.480\nbaby is worth $50,000 of credit on a social media site because it's so young you could like so you\n\n30:30.480 --> 30:36.320\ncould sign a contract for it to like committing to one over the other and then like i just like\n\n30:36.320 --> 30:42.160\nthe idea didn't pop a john as you get older then you pay if you're 90 years old you have to pay\n\n30:42.160 --> 30:53.440\na million dollars a minute to be around people it kind of it makes perfect sense it seems hard to\n\n30:53.440 --> 30:58.480\nparody like i was trying to think of like how to like come up with something that was like beyond\n\n30:58.480 --> 31:03.520\nparody but seems reasonable but i feel like there could just be like an app that like pays people\n\n31:03.520 --> 31:09.040\nto eat bugs like you just take a picture of a cricket and they'll just give you like 30 cents\n\n31:09.040 --> 31:14.560\nand they'll be like yeah it's sustainable blockchain it's helping everybody and

slippery pit whenever we have like a really\n\n31:45.920 --> 31:54.400\nbad show i pay a 68 year old man to shit on my chest and he pays me four dollars\n\n31:54.400 --> 32:07.360\nit's a wonderful

name um i'm jimmy i actually i have he him pronouns but it's all\n\n45:49.840 --> 45:53.200\ngood you have sparkles kind of wait what's the pronoun thinking i'm not gonna make a big deal\n\n45:53.200 --> 46:00.640\nout of it but i didn't hear you he oh you're like oh he okay well that's easy okay Jesus somebody\n\n46:00.640 --> 46:06.640\nchallenge me i should have just made up a new pronoun we like to do that just to just to fuck\n\n46:06.640 --> 46:15.600\nwith you i'm so i'm so stoked he he is a pronoun but i'm fucking um like my my dad was also like that\n\n46:15.600 --> 46:22.960\nwhen when i came out to him it's so great to meet you came out as what to your dad uh non-binary\n\n46:22.960 --> 46:28.320\noh so but non-binary and but but but you can still you prefer pronoun it can just be whatever i mean\n\n46:28.320 --> 46:33.280\nit's it's it's a preferred yeah no there are there are actually a bunch and trans community is pretty\n\n46:33.280 --> 46:39.440\npositive when it comes to making up your own pronoun what goes it what goes into like like for you\n\n46:39.440 --> 46:48.320\npersonally what if if um considering like i like i understand and don't understand like like okay\n\n46:48.320 --> 46:55.920\nnon-binary but then in picking a pronoun is it based on utility or other yeah like is it is it\n\n46:57.280 --> 47:01.280\nis it a choice for other people or is it a choice for yourself when you pick a pronoun\n\n47:01.280 --> 47:06.080\nyou individually not the royal you you're not representing anybody yeah no i get you to mean\n\n47:06.080 --> 47:11.280\nbut it's like when you go out on the street it's like it's like it is a utility thing like how\n\n47:11.280 --> 47:17.360\nmuch energy am i gonna take to educate every person that i come across and also are they gonna\n\n47:17.360 --> 47:23.840\nbeat me up if i'm like right you know you you hear uh my my voice started dropping recently\n\n47:23.840 --> 47:33.760\nand that's a pretty exciting thing for me but yeah thank you so so sometimes i'll do that\n\n47:33.760 --> 47:38.400\nand it's like a safety thing so if i feel somebody kind of like they give you the up and down and\n\n47:38.400 --> 47:43.760\nthey clock you and and they're like all right sir come over here i'm like oh there yes yes i will\n\n47:43.760 --> 47:52.000\ncome over there but other times if i if i look at somebody and based off of what they're wearing\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:57.520\nor like if they're millennial-ish looking i'll go oh yeah i use they them and usually they're like\n\n47:57.520 --> 48:05.120\noh cool cool cool yeah yeah man it's a it's a i feel i feel compelled to say like do you\n\n48:05.120 --> 48:11.360\nremember you you know nova from the podcast uh yeah is she here are they here sorry i'm like i\n\n48:11.360 --> 48:15.120\ndo that all the time i kind of feel compelled them or not i hope this isn't a betrayal of our\n\n48:15.120 --> 48:19.600\nbecause we talked about it after the show but but i feel like this is something you'd want people to\n\n48:19.600 --> 48:24.080\nknow that that i you know how it's like like the first time i met nova it was like i'm immediately\n\n48:24.080 --> 48:30.720\nlike oh i know i i do it too they said they and then i was like she and and she and whatever\n\n48:30.720 --> 48:34.720\nthen i did it three times around and every time i like do the self deprecating thing where i'm like\n\n48:34.720 --> 48:40.960\ncome on focus and stuff and then i was talking to nova after the show one time a couple weeks ago\n\n48:40.960 --> 48:47.040\nand another interesting conversation was actually because no rest for the wicked it's like that's\n\n48:47.040 --> 48:56.240\nactually now like like like nova was like like i don't i don't want to care that much if people\n\n48:56.240 --> 49:01.920\nfuck up i don't that that is not my choice to make a big deal out of it a preference is just a\n\n49:01.920 --> 49:08.160\npreference and and and uh at which point it occurred to me that it's actually it's it's\n\n49:08.160 --> 49:14.320\nanother thing now that i have to keep in mind is like i kind of like take it all onto myself\n\n49:14.320 --> 49:20.560\nwhen i when i go like oh did i get that right it's all about me as opposed to just like continuing\n\n49:20.560 --> 49:25.600\nto grow and and take it and stride well i mean it's like that internalized anxiety is something\n\n49:25.600 --> 49:33.120\ni feel that every trans person has it's something like also white guilt as i'm white so i you know\n\n49:33.120 --> 49:44.080\nwhy are you laughing at white guilt if you just like yeah can i write a monologue for you to do\n\n49:44.080 --> 49:52.480\nabout how white guilt is a serious issue

--> 01:02:12.480\nbut because it was a bunch of lonely people doing that but yeah i know i hear that a lot\n\n01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.400\nand in a good way i like i love hearing that that's my favorite that's my favorite thing\n\n01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.920\nthat we always come back around to when i'm getting cranky and going why are we doing\n\n01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:26.640\nthis and all this stuff so i'm glad to hear that uh it's it's public therapy in some way and um\n\n01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:35.920\ni i loved uh a french comic that um like said this thing on scene like i'm his name\n\n01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:46.240\nyou probably never heard of it it's all right but uh in the 1980s uh he once went on stage in\n\n01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:56.080\nhis first one-man show uh show show this and you nailed it you nailed it you nailed it and uh\n\n01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:03.200\nit was there like yeah i'm an exhibitionist and you're all warriors paying to see an exhibition\n\n01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:10.960\nand that's little minded very little minded yeah so there was um a lot of you know this public\n\n01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:22.400\num psychotherapy and um this display of non narcissism trying to deal with it and and such\n\n01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:29.280\nyeah those times are changing they keep telling me like apparently i think what happened over the\n\n01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.920\nlast five years is without actually making a conscious decision because when would you ever\n\n01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:39.120\nfill out a change of address form we all moved over to the internet we started to consider it\n\n01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:46.560\nreal life and um and and and now that it is we've clearly entered an age where actually this you\n\n01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.480\nknow what you're describing which is the only thing that i ever thought i would be good for in\n\n01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:58.400\nthis world transparency like open like like kind of i'm never gonna do anything that remarkable\n\n01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:04.320\nthat's a dream why don't i just tell you everything i do what kind of thing um that's actually it's\n\n01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.760\nit's become like sort of like walking out of your house with a noose around your neck and\n\n01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:14.480\ni'm not feeling sorry for myself it's just like i'm what i'm lamenting is the end of that culture\n\n01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:22.400\nactually being encouraged to 25 year olds i can't imagine being 25 right now and and having the\n\n01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:31.520\nurges that i had when i was 25 to actually like i was like it was an ironic punk rock urge for me\n\n01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:39.760\nat 25 to go i want everyone to know everything about me that was an ironic urge back then right\n\n01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:44.560\nit was before it became fashionable yeah now now that's like hitting yourself in the face with a\n\n01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:51.440\nhammer it's a cry for help it's and it's it's abusable and you asked for it if you engage in\n\n01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:58.240\nthat behavior because it's you know uh what are your feelings about this spangled jacket forgot\n\n01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:05.920\nyour name jimmy right starts with a j ends with a jimmy jimmy jimmy if you're gonna forget a

01:06:26.560\nin california thank you and um helped legalize weed in california and uh and and we all thank\n\n01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.520\nyou for that right and so i've been back for three days so i'm high as fuck right oh shit\n\n01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:38.160\nuh oh okay it's all right do you think there's gonna be like a new i forgot the question is\n\n01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:42.240\nthere gonna be like a new internet though like what jan was saying is that like it used to be\n\n01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:47.360\nthe internet was a secret place where you go to hide from like the world and complain about the world\n\n01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.760\nbut now the internet is the world so is there any place where it's like the internet was where we\n\n01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:57.280\nretreat from there to where it's like now safe to complain about like i guess that's the real world\n\n01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:04.720\nnow right we retreat to the real world to complain about what's happening online well that's sad or\n\n01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:14.640\ngood it's definitely something right it's it's like when people talk to you about i'm on stage it's\n\n01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.520\ncool let's keep i don't i don't know how no no you do it it's like it's like it's like when people\n\n01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:24.480\nthat you know on twitter talk to you in real life about things that they read about on twitter and\n\n01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.760\nthey'll like take you through the tweet verbally if you haven't seen it that's like that's strange\n\n01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:35.920\nsort of doubling that's better than uh had people forcing you to watch youtube videos\n\n01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:43.360\njust because it takes less time well yeah i think people are also going back to traditional\n\n01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:51.280\nmethods of communication i hate that like uh like letters or like you mean like letters and words\n\n01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:59.600\nyeah like like snail mail i think he means postcards okay yeah it's hard to say like one\n\n01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.080\nobjective thing you can say is we're getting to a point where we're looking at the internet we're\n\n01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:09.600\ngoing oh because we all live in this cloud where nothing is real and then but then the idea that\n\n01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:24.000\nit's not real is alternatively weaponized and then but then idealized and i i get really alarmed\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:35.360\nabout the idea of sliding into convicted cynicism because the bad guys like that they love the idea\n\n01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:41.920\nthat if you get in a fight with a psycho five minutes into a fight with a psycho\n\n01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:48.960\nall you really know is that you don't even know what the fuck is going on and it's like\n\n01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:56.000\ntheir specialty it's like it's a win-win it's like it favors a person that just wants to\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:05.600\ndamage and it and it and it and it it it it it it disadvantages actual earnest communication\n\n01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.840\nbecause like that that's the thing that i really really panic about is that point where we all go\n\n01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.600\nwell nothing's real nothing's real at all like yeah what did you see that on a screen well that\n\n01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.320\nmeans is that means it either is or isn't real i would love to live in a world where it was like\n\n01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.040\ndid you see that on a screen that means it isn't real period but i don't think that we could\n\n01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:34.400\never commit to that like we we will still we i mean we know that my favorite martian isn't real\n\n01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:43.440\nbut we he's our favorite martian um assuming we're all 70 um i just i just mean that like the\n\n01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.440\nentire tv industry is based on the fact that when we see something on a screen we tend to love it\n\n01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:54.640\nwell we we we know that uh share isn't performing for us she's in a concert in scotland but we're\n\n01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:02.800\nlike wow what a great good job she did in my living room like we we we we we we we we we\n\n01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.040\nwere transfixed by the screen even though we know it's not real so the internet is now saying like\n\n01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:14.400\noh and we're going to put thoughts in your head that say mankind is evil mankind is good these\n\n01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:22.640\nuniversal truths are now up for sale and i i've um i got too drunk late in the podcast\n\n01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:34.240\nyeah it's at this point where i become my own guest um kind of a surprise guest so it's like\n\n01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.360\nas usual the the trope with this podcast is the question it turns into a story and\n\n01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:46.000\nwith the narrative you figure out what the actual question was which is just a story in\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.360\nit of itself yeah i don't know yeah i mean what what you said for sure\n\n01:10:56.240 -->

01:15:59.440\nuncomfortable because he was always like hey i was thinking about committing suicide and then\n\n01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:06.400\nit's like flirt you know it seems wrong it seems wrong to enable that it does like i i don't i feel\n\n01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:14.160\nlike but i don't really actually think that the end of the game would be uh fresh water restored\n\n01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.840\nto the commonwealth and then i'm like walking with my dog and uh and then there's a pause and then\n\n01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:26.560\nyou hear a distant gunshot that would be good that'd be really good and then and then the games\n\n01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:35.840\nhas every choice matters you kept enabling him he told you he wanted to kill himself and instead\n\n01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.800\nof talking to other people you told him good job he said he didn't want to anymore though\n\n01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.160\nwhat time he said he didn't want to anymore right but he always says that\n\n01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:53.440\nyou know he keeps saying that but he also keeps bringing it up so i need i need i need everybody\n\n01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:58.400\nwho ever has that thought entering their head to tell anybody that they possibly feel comfortable\n\n01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:03.360\ntelling it to him being absolutely unashamed of it i do not want my relationships to start\n\n01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:09.920\nthat way i think that's dangerous it's unhealthy not dangerous maybe dangerous is too punitive\n\n01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:17.600\nit's unhealthy it's not the right time to look up if you're if you're like yeah i just finished\n\n01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:23.120\nbattling the cosmos like i'm not even sure if i should be breathing or not and no but anyways\n\n01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:29.520\nwhat's your birthstone like like no you're not ready to but maybe if you say flirt then maybe he'll\n\n01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.960\nbe like well i've just been having these dark thoughts so let's take it slow and then you'll\n\n01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.360\nbe like okay cool you know who knows but the relationship would forever no matter what his\n\n01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.760\nbehavior would would be the relationship would be forever tainted by this idea that the coupling\n\n01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:47.440\npoint was was that which me which would imply to me logically that if we ever broke it off\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.120\nthat he would be returning to the state that i met him in which was suicidal you're right that\n\n01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.840\nisn't healthy i before i met you i was thinking of committing suicide i was like well get over that\n\n01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:05.040\nyeah um and and love every love yourself and and all this stuff and then let's let's both\n\n01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.120\nfuck around and make huge mistakes like like because neither of us are perfect and the goal\n\n01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:16.400\nof relationships isn't perfection however definitely if someone's like a coupling point is like the\n\n01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:23.040\nreason we should fuck right now is because i was about to kill myself that that i think those\n\n01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.920\ntines need to have little scotch tape best buy things put on them works for me\n\n01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.160\ncan't tell you how much jimmy you look at jimmy i saw a look in your eye like you you're you're\n\n01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:42.080\nlike i can talk about this yeah well it was just like you're talking about listen if you're you're\n\n01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:48.960\nsaying no you're i'm dr j you just took away my chief move sorry go ahead i'm gonna let you finish\n\n01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:55.440\nno no no i was i i did finish i was not letting you finish was my thing that was my thing um well\n\n01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:01.040\nthe way if you say that every relationship it's not about perfection but then you're also talking\n\n01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:11.120\nabout uh like the perfect it like the relationship's path is predetermined so you're like you're\n\n01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.840\nsaying well i'm not going to go into it if it's not perfect you know oh no no no i didn't mean to\n\n01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:23.040\napply that i i it's hard it's hard to talk about there's no shared like vocabulary with it what\n\n01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:30.160\ni was saying is in the kind of like uh these sort of like all i can picture it is uh like sort of\n\n01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:37.840\nspace modular like space station blocks and like they have like coupling points on them right like\n\n01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:44.160\nso this thing's got a tab and this thing's got a slot or this thing's got a thing and it's like\n\n01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.080\nlike the way that we meet each other and the the things that we say over coffee and the\n\n01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:52.800\nthings that we say over the moments leading up to us actually maybe physically consummating a\n\n01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:59.520\nrelationship um and then the all of these things like that the flux that is welding us together\n\n01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:06.880\nall i'm saying is um if if as in the end of speed did you ever see speed with keanu reeves and uh\n\n01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:13.760\nuh sandra bullock they they make sure everyone knows throughout that movie this relationship\n\n01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:21.520\nis not going to work why because it's based on speed yeah it's they care that's a nice refreshing\n\n01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:26.720\nthing about that action movie they at least they say if there's a speed two one of us isn't coming\n\n01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:32.560\nback and they both know it during speed because they're like did you know that i think because\n\n01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:39.760\nof the way they say it is like really uh relationships built during trauma are not going to last what\n\n01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:51.360\nis this oh no i'm on i'm on the stage just smartwatch dan fucking pick up me\n\n01:20:51.360 --> 01:21:10.160\nokay
